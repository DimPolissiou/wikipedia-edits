Fallujah has toured with acts such as [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]], [[Carnifex (band)|Carnifex]], [[Thy Art is Murder]], [[Dying Fetus]], [[Between the Buried and Me]], and [[The Contortionist]].\n\n== History ==\nFallujah was founded in early 2007 by high school friends Alex Hofmann, Scott Carstairs, Tommy Logan, Dan Wissinger, and Suliman Arghandiwal. Their first show was on June 15, 2007 in [[Walnut Creek, California]]. Their first four songs released were \"Tyrant\", \"Verdict\", \"Schleicher\" and \"Infidel\" as demos. The band's sound and inception was heavily influenced by the Bay Area hardcore scene; often playing with bands such as Lionheart, Hoods, Suffokate, and Lose None.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nLater that year, bassist Dan Wissinger and Drummer Tommy Logan departed. Brandon \"Brando\" Hoberg from the band Vivisection joined on bass and friend Andrew Baird joined on drums. In winter of 2007, Fallujah recorded their 2nd demo at TWS studios in [[Vacaville, California]]. The songs \"Prophets\", \"Blacklist\", and \"100 Years From Now\" were on this demo. They were released in January 2008.\n\nAfter about a year of playing songs of previous recordings, they began writing their debut EP ''Leper Colony''. Prior to recording, Fallujah parted with their original singer, Suliman Arghandiwal. Guitar player Alex Hofmann took up vocals while Rob Maramonte joined as guitar player. Leper Colony laid the groundwork for what would become the band's characterizing sound, mixing [[technical death metal]], [[black metal]], and atmospheric elements such as heavy reverb and synthesizers.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The band began recording New Year's Day with Sam Pura of Panda Studios in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. The EP was released in late January 2009.\n\nFallujah expanded their area and reputation greatly in the months after the release of ''Leper Colony''. The band embarked on their first legitimate tour just days after finishing high school.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Between 2009 and 2011 the band embarked on several US tours with bands such as Fallen Figure, Picture it in Ruins, Condemned, Diskreet, and Catalepsy.\n\nIn 2011 Fallujah went on to finish their first full-length album \"The Harvest Wombs\" with California-based label Unique Leader Records. The album further expanded their fanbase and signature tone incorporating melodic leads, atmospheric chord progressions and abandoning heavy breakdowns.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAfter the release of The Harvest Wombs the band went on to tour both domestically and internationally in support of bands such as [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]], [[Goatwhore]], [[Hate Eternal]], [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]], [[Cephalic Carnage]], [[Skeletonwitch]], [[Havok (band)|Havok]] and [[Pathology (band)|Pathology]].\n\nIn May 2013 the band independently released the EP ''Nomadic'' which is known as the first release that solidified Fallujah's style of \"atmospheric death metal\"{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} incorporating ambient sequences, clean guitars, and female vocals by Byanca Munoz of the band [[Whirr (band)|Whirr]].\n\nOn July 22, 2014, Fallujah released their second album ''[[The Flesh Prevails]]'' on [[Unique Leader Records]].<ref name=\"Metalbase.in\">{{cite web | url=http://metalbase.in/2014/08/09/fallujah-the-flesh-prevails/ | title=Fallujah: The Flesh Prevails | work=Metalbase | accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref> The album was released while the band participated in the 2014 Summer Slaughter tour alongside [[Morbid Angel]], [[The Faceless]], [[Dying Fetus]], and [[Thy Art is Murder]]. The album received significant acclaim, despite some critics saying the production was a victim of the \"Loudness Wars\" and little dynamic range.\n\nIn 2016 the band announced that they would release a new album with their new and current signing to [[Nuclear Blast]], and has a date for April 29. The album is titled ''[[Dreamless]]'' and a music video has been released for the song \u201cThe Void Alone\", which features female singer Tori Letzler.

The Argentine \"[[Dirty War]]\", for example, which resulted in approximately 30,000 victims according to most estimates, kidnapped, tortured and killed many trade-unionists, relatives of activists, social activists such as founders of the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]], nuns, university professors, etc.\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the Chilean DINA and its Argentine counterpart, [[Secretariat of Intelligence|SIDE]], were the operation's front-line troops.

Government forces took victims by plane or helicopter out to sea, dropping them to their deaths in planned disappearances. It was said that from this military bombardment that OPR 33 infrastructure located in Argentina was destroyed. In May 1976, members of Plan Condor met in Santiago, Chile, at which the participating countries discussed \"long-range cooperation... [that] went well beyond information exchange\" and were given code names. In July, the CIA gathered intelligence that members of Plan Condor had the intention of striking \"against leaders of indigenous terrorist groups residing abroad.\"\n\nIn late 1977, due to unusual storms, numerous corpses washed up on beaches south of Buenos Aires, producing evidence of some of the government's victims. There were also hundreds of cases of babies and children being taken from mothers in prison who had been kidnapped and later disappeared; the children were given in illegal adoptions to families and associates of the regime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cij.gov.ar/nota-9856-Difundieron-los-fundamentos-de-la-condena-a-Jorge-Rafael-Videla-a-50-a-os-de-prisi-n-por-el-robo-de-beb-s.html |title=Sentencia complete de la causa ''Plan Sistem\u00e1tico de Apropiaci\u00f3n de Menores'' |author=Tribunal Oral en lo Criminal Federal nro. 6 de la Capital Federal}}</ref> The CIA also reports that Operation Condor countries took very well to the idea of working together, and developed their own communications network and combined training initiatives for such things as psychological warfare.<ref>http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB416/docs/780822cia.pdf</ref>\n\nIn a report written from Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America [[Harry W.

He was also fearful that this could lead to increasing isolation of these countries from developed Western nations.

The objective of the propaganda had two purposes. The first purpose was to diffuse/counter criticism of the governments involved by foreign media and the second was to cultivate national pride in the local populace. One propaganda piece created by Chile entitled, \"Chile after Allende,\" was distributed amongst the governments acting under Condor.  However, the document only notes that Uruguay and Argentina were the only two countries to acknowledge the agreement. In terms of Paraguay, their government was only listed as utilizing the local press, \"Patria\" as their main propaganda producer.

The Argentine [[Secretar\u00eda de Inteligencia|SIDE]] cooperated with the Chilean DINA in numerous cases of ''desaparecidos''. They assassinated Chilean General [[Carlos Prats]], former Uruguayan MPs [[Zelmar Michelini]] and [[H\u00e9ctor Guti\u00e9rrez Ruiz]], as well as the ex-president of Bolivia, [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]], in Buenos Aires.

It took testimony from hundreds of witnesses about victims of the regime and known abuses, documenting hundreds of secret prisons and [[Detention Centers in the Dirty War|detention centers]], and identifying leaders of the torture and death squads. Two years later, the ''[[Juicio a las Juntas]]'' (Trial of the Juntas) largely succeeded in proving the crimes of the top officers of the various ''juntas'' that had formed the self-styled [[National Reorganization Process]].

Although the United States viewed conflict from a global and ideological perspective, many decolonized nations defined national security threats in terms of neighboring nations and longstanding ethnic or regional feuds. Shlaudeman notes the incredible resilience that Paraguay showed against the superior military might of its neighbors during the Chaco War. From the perspective of the government in Paraguay, the victory against its neighbors over the course of several decades justified the lack of development in the nation. The report further states that the political traditions in Paraguay were anything but democratic. Like many other nations that won independence in the Cold War, democracy was a foreign concept. This reality, combined with a fear of leftist dissent in neighboring nations, led the government to focus on the containment of political opposition instead of on the development of its economic and political institutions. An ideological fear of its neighbors compelled them to protect its sovereignty. Therefore, the fight against radical, leftist movements within and without the country motivated many policymakers to act in the interest of security.<ref>https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB416/docs/0000A02E.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Peruvian case ===\n[[File:F.

These centers were managed by the ''Grupo de Tareas 18'', headed by former police officer and intelligence agent [[An\u00edbal Gordon]], earlier convicted of armed robbery, who reported directly to General Commandant of the [[SIDE]], Otto Paladino.<ref name=\"Elcorreo\">[http://www.elcorreo.eu.org/esp/article.php3?id_article=6378 \"Automotores Orletti el taller asesino del C\u00f3ndor\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516034522/http://www.elcorreo.eu.org/esp/article.php3?id_article=6378 |date=16 May 2007 }}, ''[[Juventud Rebelde]]'', 3 January 2006 (mirrored on ''[[El Correo.eu.org]]'') {{in lang|es|fr}}</ref>\n\n''Automotores Orletti'' was the main base of foreign intelligence services involved in Operation Condor. Jos\u00e9 Luis Bertazzo, a survivor of kidnapping and torture who was detained there for two months, identified Chilean, Uruguayan, Paraguayan and Bolivian nationals held as prisoners and who were interrogated by agents from their own countries. The 19-year-old daughter-in-law of poet [[Juan Gelman]] was tortured here along with her husband, before being transported to a Montevideo prison. There she delivered a baby which was immediately stolen by Uruguayan military officers and placed for illegal adoption with friends of the regime.<ref name=\"Elcorreo\"/> Decades later, President [[Jorge Batlle]] ordered an investigation and finally, [[Macarena Gelman]] was found and recovered her identity.\n\nAccording to Dinges' book ''Los a\u00f1os del C\u00f3ndor'' (The Years of the Condor), Chilean [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] prisoners in the Orletti center told Jos\u00e9 Luis Bertazzo that they had seen two Cuban diplomats, 22-year-old Jes\u00fas Cejas Arias and 26-year-old Crescencio Gala\u00f1ega, tortured by Gordon's group. They were interrogated by a man who had travelled from Miami to interrogate them. The Cuban nationals had been responsible for protection of Cuban ambassador to Argentina, Emilio Aragon\u00e9s. They were kidnapped on 9 August 1976, at the corner of calle Arribe\u00f1os and Virrey del Pino, by 40 armed SIDE agents, who blocked the street with their [[Ford Falcon (Argentina)|Ford Falcon]]s. (These were the car models used by the security forces during the dictatorship.)<ref name=\"Elcorreo\"/>\n\nAccording to Dinges, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] were informed of their arrest. He quotes a cable sent from Buenos Aires by FBI agent [[Robert Scherrer]] on 22 September 1976, in which he mentioned that Michael Townley, later convicted for the assassination of former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C., had taken part in the interrogations of the two Cubans. On 22 December 1999, the former head of the DINA confirmed to Argentine federal judge Mar\u00eda Servini de Cubr\u00eda in Santiago de Chile that Michael Townley and Cuban [[Guillermo Novo Sampoll]] were present in the Orletti center.

It stated that the operation was an effort of six countries in the southern cone of Latin America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay) to win the \"Third-World-War\" by wiping out \"subversion\" through transnational secret intelligence activities, kidnapping, torture, disappearance and assassination. The report opens by considering the cohesiveness felt by the six nations of the Southern Cone. It was the assumption of the Shlaudeman's briefing that the countries in the Southern Cone perceived themselves as \"the last bastion of Christian civilization\" and thus they consider the efforts against communism as justified as the \"Israeli actions against Palestinians terrorist\". Shlaudeman warns Kissinger that in the long term the \"Third World War\" would put those six countries in an ambiguous position because they are trapped on either side by \"international Marxism and its terrorist exponents,\" and on the other by \"the hostility of uncomprehending industrial democracies misled by the Marxist propaganda.\"<ref>Schlaudeman, Harry. \"The \"Third World War\" and South America.\" Unclassified Department of State (July 1976): n. pag.

A declassified CIA document dated 23 June 1976, explains that \"in early 1974, security officials from Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia met in Buenos Aires to prepare coordinated actions against subversive targets.\"<ref name=\"Rowman & Littlefield Publishers\"/> US officials were aware of what was going on.\n\nAdditionally, as of a September 1976, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that US intelligence services were quite aware of the infrastructure and goals of Operation Condor. They realized that \"Operation Condor\" was the code name given for intelligence collection on \"leftists\", Communists, Peronists or Marxists in the Southern Cone Area. The intelligence services were aware that it was security cooperation among several South American countries' intelligence services (such as Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia) with Chile as the epicenter of the operation. The DIA noted that Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile were already fervently conducting operations, mainly in Argentina, against leftist targets.<ref>Osorio, Carlos. \"Operation Condor on Trial.\" The National Security Archive.

Web. 11 May 2017.\n</ref> Members of SIDE were also operating with Uruguayan military Intelligence officers in an operation carried out against the Uruguayan terrorist organization, the OPR-33.

The report notes, \"the formation of special teams from member countries who are to carry out operations to include assassinations against terrorist or supporters of terrorist organizations.\" The report also highlighted the fact that these special teams were intelligence service agents rather than military personnel, however these teams did operate in structures reminiscent of U.S. special forces teams.<ref name=NSAEBB185/> The State Department briefing for Kissinger mentioned awareness of Operation Condor's plans to conduct possible operations in France and Portugal - a matter that would be prove to be extremely controversial later in Condor's history.<ref name=NSAEBB185/>\n\nThe US government sponsored and collaborated with DINA (Directorate of National Intelligence), as well as other intelligence organizations forming the nucleus of Condor. CIA documents show that the agency had close contact with members of the Chilean secret police, DINA, and its chief [[Manuel Contreras]].<ref name=\"CIA Activities in Chile\">{{cite web\n  | title =CIA Activities in Chile\n  | publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]\n  | date=18 September 2000\n  | url =https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/chile/#10\n  | accessdate =14 September 2014 }}</ref> Contreras was retained as a paid CIA contact until 1977, even as his involvement in the Letelier-Moffit assassination was being revealed.\n\nThe Paraguayan Archives include official requests to track suspects to and from the U.S. Embassy, the CIA, and FBI. The CIA provided lists of suspects and other intelligence information to the military states. In 1975 the FBI searched in the US for individuals wanted by DINA.<ref>Weiner (1999). J. Patrice McSherry notes; \"In the Paraguayan Archives, I found correspondence documenting similar coordination in other cases.\"</ref>\n\nIn a February 1976 telecom from the embassy in Buenos Aires to the State Department, intelligence noted the United States possessed awareness of the coming Argentinian coup. The ambassador wrote that the Chief of the North American desk of the Foreign Ministry revealed that he had been asked by the \"Military Planning Group\" to prepare a report and recommendations for how the \"future military government can avoid or minimize the sort of problems the Chilean and Uruguayan governments are having with the US over human rights issue.\" The Chief also specifically stated that \"they\" (whether he is referring to the CIA or the future military government in Argentina, or both) will face resistance if they were to begin assassinating and executing individuals. This being true, the ambassador explains the military coup will \"intend to carry forward an all-out war on the terrorists and that some executions would therefore probably be necessary.\" This signals that the US also was aware of the planning of human rights violations before they occurred and did not step in to prevent them, despite being entangled in the region's politics already. The last comment confirms this: \"It is encouraging to note that the Argentine military are aware of the problem and are already focusing on ways to avoid letting human rights issues become an irritant in US-Argentine Relations.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Communication From Ambassador Hill for ARA Acting Assistant Secretary|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB185/19760216%20Military%20Take%20Cognizance%20of%20Human%20Rights%20Issue%2000009FF0.pdf|website=National Security Archive|accessdate=30 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the ongoing human rights abuses by the Argentine junta, professor Ruth Blakeley writes that Kissinger \"explicitly expressed his support for the repression of political opponents.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Blakeley|first=Ruth|date=2009 |title=State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The North in the South|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415462402/|location= |publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rft8AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA96#v=onepage 96]|isbn=978-0415686174}}</ref> On 5 October 1976 [[Henry Kissinger]] met with Argentina's Foreign Minister and said:\n\n{{quote|Look, our basic attitude is that we would like you to succeed.

''La Cit\u00e9'' published a review, ''Le Verbe'', which influenced military officers during the Algerian War, notably by justifying their use of torture. At the end of the 1950s, the ''Cit\u00e9 catholique'' established groups in Argentina and set up cells in the Army. It was greatly expanded during the government of General [[Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda]], in particular in 1969.<ref name=\"Pagina12\"/>\n\nThe key figure of the ''Cit\u00e9 catholique'' was priest Georges Grasset, who became Videla's personal confessor. He had been the spiritual guide of the [[Organisation arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te]] (OAS), a pro-French Algeria terrorist movement founded in [[Franquist Spain]]. Robin says that this Catholic fundamentalist current in the Argentine Army contributed to the importance and duration of Franco-Argentine cooperation. In Buenos Aires, Georges Grasset maintained links with Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]], founder of the [[Society of St. Pius X]] in 1970. He was excommunicated in 1988. The Society of Pius-X has four monasteries in Argentina, the largest in La Reja. A French priest there said to Marie-Monique Robin: \"to save the soul of a Communist priest, one must kill him.\" [[Luis Roldan]], former Under Secretary of Religion under [[Carlos Menem]] (President of Argentina from 1989 to 1999), was presented to her by Dominique Lagneau, the priest in charge of the monastery, and described as \"Mr. Cit\u00e9 catholique in Argentina\".

Perseval, who lives today in Thailand, denied any links with the abduction. He has admitted being a former member of the [[Organisation de l'arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]], and having escaped for Argentina after the March 1962 [[\u00c9vian Accords]] that ended the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362).

The Argentine \"[[Dirty War]]\", for example, which resulted in approximately 30,000 victims according to most estimates, kidnapped, tortured and killed many trade-unionists, relatives of activists, social activists such as founders of the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]], nuns, university professors, etc.\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the Chilean DINA and its Argentine counterpart, [[Secretariat of Intelligence|SIDE]], were the operation's front-line troops.

Government forces took victims by plane or helicopter out to sea, dropping them to their deaths in planned disappearances. It was said that from this military bombardment that OPR 33 infrastructure located in Argentina was destroyed. In May 1976, members of Plan Condor met in Santiago, Chile, at which the participating countries discussed \"long-range cooperation... [that] went well beyond information exchange\" and were given code names. In July, the CIA gathered intelligence that members of Plan Condor had the intention of striking \"against leaders of indigenous terrorist groups residing abroad.\"\n\nIn late 1977, due to unusual storms, numerous corpses washed up on beaches south of Buenos Aires, producing evidence of some of the government's victims. There were also hundreds of cases of babies and children being taken from mothers in prison who had been kidnapped and later disappeared; the children were given in illegal adoptions to families and associates of the regime.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cij.gov.ar/nota-9856-Difundieron-los-fundamentos-de-la-condena-a-Jorge-Rafael-Videla-a-50-a-os-de-prisi-n-por-el-robo-de-beb-s.html |title=Sentencia complete de la causa ''Plan Sistem\u00e1tico de Apropiaci\u00f3n de Menores'' |author=Tribunal Oral en lo Criminal Federal nro. 6 de la Capital Federal}}</ref> The CIA also reports that Operation Condor countries took very well to the idea of working together, and developed their own communications network and combined training initiatives for such things as psychological warfare.<ref>http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB416/docs/780822cia.pdf</ref>\n\nIn a report written from Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America [[Harry W.

He was also fearful that this could lead to increasing isolation of these countries from developed Western nations. He believed that there was justification to some of their fears, yet he felt that by reacting too strongly these countries could engender a strong terrorist counter reaction similar to the PLO in Israel.<ref name=\"nsarchive.gwu.edu\"/>\n\nU.S. documents dated April 17, 1977, listed Chile and Argentina as both active in utilizing communications media for the purpose of broadcasting propaganda. The objective of the propaganda had two purposes. The first purpose was to diffuse/counter criticism of the governments involved by foreign media and the second was to cultivate national pride in the local populace. One propaganda piece created by Chile entitled, \"Chile after Allende,\" was distributed amongst the governments acting under Condor.  However, the document only notes that Uruguay and Argentina were the only two countries to acknowledge the agreement. In terms of Paraguay, their government was only listed as utilizing the local press, \"Patria\" as their main propaganda producer.

Although the United States viewed conflict from a global and ideological perspective, many decolonized nations defined national security threats in terms of neighboring nations and longstanding ethnic or regional feuds. Shlaudeman notes the incredible resilience that Paraguay showed against the superior military might of its neighbors during the Chaco War. From the perspective of the government in Paraguay, the victory against its neighbors over the course of several decades justified the lack of development in the nation. The report further states that the political traditions in Paraguay were anything but democratic. Like many other nations that won independence in the Cold War, democracy was a foreign concept. This reality, combined with a fear of leftist dissent in neighboring nations, led the government to focus on the containment of political opposition instead of on the development of its economic and political institutions. An ideological fear of its neighbors compelled them to protect its sovereignty.

It stated that the operation was an effort of six countries in the southern cone of Latin America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay) to win the \"Third-World-War\" by wiping out \"subversion\" through transnational secret intelligence activities, kidnapping, torture, disappearance and assassination. The report opens by considering the cohesiveness felt by the six nations of the Southern Cone. It was the assumption of the Shlaudeman's briefing that the countries in the Southern Cone perceived themselves as \"the last bastion of Christian civilization\" and thus they consider the efforts against communism as justified as the \"Israeli actions against Palestinians terrorist\". Shlaudeman warns Kissinger that in the long term the \"Third World War\" would put those six countries in an ambiguous position because they are trapped on either side by \"international Marxism and its terrorist exponents,\" and on the other by \"the hostility of uncomprehending industrial democracies misled by the Marxist propaganda.\"<ref>Schlaudeman, Harry. \"The \"Third World War\" and South America.\" Unclassified Department of State (July 1976): n. pag.

A declassified CIA document dated 23 June 1976, explains that \"in early 1974, security officials from Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia met in Buenos Aires to prepare coordinated actions against subversive targets.\"<ref name=\"Rowman & Littlefield Publishers\"/> US officials were aware of what was going on.\n\nAdditionally, as of a September 1976, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that US intelligence services were quite aware of the infrastructure and goals of Operation Condor. They realized that \"Operation Condor\" was the code name given for intelligence collection on \"leftists\", Communists, Peronists or Marxists in the Southern Cone Area. The intelligence services were aware that it was security cooperation among several South American countries' intelligence services (such as Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia) with Chile as the epicenter of the operation. The DIA noted that Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile were already fervently conducting operations, mainly in Argentina, against leftist targets.<ref>Osorio, Carlos. \"Operation Condor on Trial.\" The National Security Archive.

The report notes, \"the formation of special teams from member countries who are to carry out operations to include assassinations against terrorist or supporters of terrorist organizations.\" The report also highlighted the fact that these special teams were intelligence service agents rather than military personnel, however these teams did operate in structures reminiscent of U.S. special forces teams.<ref name=NSAEBB185/> The State Department briefing for Kissinger mentioned awareness of Operation Condor's plans to conduct possible operations in France and Portugal - a matter that would be prove to be extremely controversial later in Condor's history.<ref name=NSAEBB185/>\n\nThe US government sponsored and collaborated with DINA (Directorate of National Intelligence), as well as other intelligence organizations forming the nucleus of Condor.

The CIA provided lists of suspects and other intelligence information to the military states. In 1975 the FBI searched in the US for individuals wanted by DINA.<ref>Weiner (1999). J. Patrice McSherry notes; \"In the Paraguayan Archives, I found correspondence documenting similar coordination in other cases.\"</ref>\n\nIn a February 1976 telecom from the embassy in Buenos Aires to the State Department, intelligence noted the United States possessed awareness of the coming Argentinian coup. The ambassador wrote that the Chief of the North American desk of the Foreign Ministry revealed that he had been asked by the \"Military Planning Group\" to prepare a report and recommendations for how the \"future military government can avoid or minimize the sort of problems the Chilean and Uruguayan governments are having with the US over human rights issue.\" The Chief also specifically stated that \"they\" (whether he is referring to the CIA or the future military government in Argentina, or both) will face resistance if they were to begin assassinating and executing individuals. This being true, the ambassador explains the military coup will \"intend to carry forward an all-out war on the terrorists and that some executions would therefore probably be necessary.\" This signals that the US also was aware of the planning of human rights violations before they occurred and did not step in to prevent them, despite being entangled in the region's politics already. The last comment confirms this: \"It is encouraging to note that the Argentine military are aware of the problem and are already focusing on ways to avoid letting human rights issues become an irritant in US-Argentine Relations.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Communication From Ambassador Hill for ARA Acting Assistant Secretary|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB185/19760216%20Military%20Take%20Cognizance%20of%20Human%20Rights%20Issue%2000009FF0.pdf|website=National Security Archive|accessdate=30 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the ongoing human rights abuses by the Argentine junta, professor Ruth Blakeley writes that Kissinger \"explicitly expressed his support for the repression of political opponents.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Blakeley|first=Ruth|date=2009 |title=State Terrorism and Neoliberalism: The North in the South|url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415462402/|location= |publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=rft8AgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA96#v=onepage 96]|isbn=978-0415686174}}</ref> On 5 October 1976 [[Henry Kissinger]] met with Argentina's Foreign Minister and said:\n\n{{quote|Look, our basic attitude is that we would like you to succeed.

''La Cit\u00e9'' published a review, ''Le Verbe'', which influenced military officers during the Algerian War, notably by justifying their use of torture. At the end of the 1950s, the ''Cit\u00e9 catholique'' established groups in Argentina and set up cells in the Army. It was greatly expanded during the government of General [[Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda]], in particular in 1969.<ref name=\"Pagina12\"/>\n\nThe key figure of the ''Cit\u00e9 catholique'' was priest Georges Grasset, who became Videla's personal confessor.

Robin says that this Catholic fundamentalist current in the Argentine Army contributed to the importance and duration of Franco-Argentine cooperation. In Buenos Aires, Georges Grasset maintained links with Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]], founder of the [[Society of St. Pius X]] in 1970. He was excommunicated in 1988. The Society of Pius-X has four monasteries in Argentina, the largest in La Reja.

For 23 years, in the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity, the two powers struggled for supremacy, primarily on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa. After immense material and human losses on both sides the Carthaginians were defeated.\n\nThe war began in 264 BC with the Romans gaining a foothold on Sicily at [[Battle of Messana|Messana]] (modern [[Messina]]). The Romans then pressed [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the only significant independent power on the island, into allying with them and laid siege to Carthage's main base at [[Agrigento|Akragas]]. A large Carthaginian army attempted to lift the siege in 262 BC, but was heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Agrigentum|Battle of Akragas]]. The Romans then built a navy to challenge Carthage's, and using novel tactics inflicted several defeats. A Carthaginian base on [[Corsica]] was seized, but an attack on [[Sardinia]] was repulsed; the base on Corsica was then lost. Taking advantage of their naval victories the Romans launched an invasion of North Africa, which the Carthaginians intercepted. At the [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus]] the Carthaginians were again beaten; this was possibly the [[largest naval battle in history]] by the number of combatants involved. The invasion initially went well and in 255 BC the Carthaginians [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]]; the proposed terms were so harsh they fought on, [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|defeating the invaders]]. The Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their survivors and the Carthaginians opposed it at the [[Battle of Cape Hermaeum]] off Africa; the Carthaginians were heavily defeated, losing 114 ships captured. The Roman fleet, in turn, was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, losing 384 ships and 100,000 men.\n\nThe war continued, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, adding 220 new ships. The Carthaginians attacked and recaptured Akragas in 255 BC, but not believing they could hold the city, they razed and abandoned it. The Romans captured Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]) in 254 BC. The next year they lost another 150 ships to a storm while returning from raiding the North African coast. In 251 BC the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Panormus, but were defeated in a [[ Battle of Panormus|battle outside the walls]]. Slowly the Romans had occupied most of Sicily; in 249 BC they besieged the last two Carthaginian strongholds{{snd}}in the extreme west. They also launched a surprise attack on the Carthaginian fleet, which was defeated at the [[Battle of Drepana]]. The Carthaginians followed up their victory and another 120 Roman warships, and 800 transports, were lost at the [[ Battle of Phintias]]. After several years of stalemate, the Romans rebuilt their fleet again in 244 BC and effectively [[blockade]]d the Carthaginian garrisons. Carthage assembled a fleet which attempted to relieve them, but it was destroyed at the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands|Aegates Islands]] in 241 BC, forcing the cut-off Carthaginian troops on Sicily to negotiate for peace. \n\nThe [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was agreed. By its terms Carthage paid large [[War reparations|reparations]] and [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily was annexed]] as a [[Roman province]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The immense effort of building 1,000 galleys during the war laid the foundation for Rome's maritime dominance for 600 years. The end of the war sparked a major but unsuccessful [[Mercenary War|revolt]] within the Carthaginian Empire. The unresolved strategic competition between Rome and Carthage would lead to the eruption of the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BC.\n\n==Sources==\n\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa|188}} BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the end of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nSince 2010, eleven bronze warship [[Naval ram|rams]] have been found by archaeologists in the sea off the west coast of Sicily, along with ten bronze helmets and hundreds of [[amphorae]].{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|Pragg|2013}}{{sfn|Murray|2019|}} The rams, seven of the helmets, and six intact amphorae, along with a large number of fragments, have since been recovered.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=12, 26, 31\u201332}} It is believed the rams were each attached to a sunken warship when they were deposited on the seabed.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=39}} The archaeologists involved stated that the location of artefacts so far discovered supports Polybius's account of where the [[Battle of the Aegates]] took place.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=35\u201336}} Based on the dimensions of the recovered rams, the archaeologists who have studied them believe they all came from [[trireme]]s, contrary to Polybius's account of all of the warships involved being [[Hellenistic-era warships#Hellenistic-era warships|quinqueremes]].{{sfn|Murray|2019|}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=39\u201342}} However, they believe that the many amphorae identified confirm the accuracy of other aspects of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=46}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, terrestrial archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Carthage-1958-PortsPuniques.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A colour photograph of an urban area by the sea with a water-filled, torus-shaped inlet.|{{center|A photograph of the remains of the naval base of the city of Carthage.

Relationships were good, with strong commercial links. During the Pyrrhic War of 280\u2013275 BC, against a king of [[Epirus]] who alternately fought Rome in Italy and Carthage on Sicily, Carthage provided [[materiel]] to the Romans and on at least one occasion used its navy to ferry a Roman force.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=94, 160, 163, 164\u2013165}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nIn 288 BC, the [[Mamertines]], a group of Italian mercenaries, previously hired by Syracuse, occupied the city of Messana (modern [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]) in the north-eastern tip of Sicily.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=165}} Hard-pressed by Syracuse, the Mamertines appealed to both Rome and Carthage for assistance. The Carthaginians acted first, pressing [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], king of Syracuse, into taking no further action and convincing the Mamertines to accept a Carthaginian garrison in Messana. According to Polybius, a considerable debate took place in Rome as to whether to accept the Mamertines' appeal for assistance, which could easily lead to war with Carthage. The Romans had not previously displayed any interest in Sicily and did not wish to come to the aid of soldiers who had unjustly stolen a city from its rightful possessors. However, many saw strategic and monetary advantages in gaining a foothold in Sicily. It was recognised that this step may lead to ill-feeling from Carthage, but war was considered far from inevitable. The deadlocked [[Roman Senate]] put the matter before the popular assembly, which decided to accept the Mamertines' request.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=42\u201345}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=150}}\n\n[[Appius Claudius Caudex]] was appointed commander of a military expedition with orders to cross to Messana.{{sfn|Starr|1991|p=479}}{{sfn|Warmington|1993|pp=168\u2013169}} Carthage was unperturbed. Their experience over the previous two centuries of warfare on Sicily was that decisive action was impossible; military efforts petered out after heavy losses and huge expense. Meanwhile, Carthaginian leaders expected that their overwhelming maritime superiority would allow the war to be kept at a distance, and even for them to continue to prosper.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}} This would allow them to recruit and pay an army that would operate in the open against the Romans, while their strongly fortified cities could be supplied by sea and provide a defensive base from which to operate.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=171}}\n\n=== Armies ===\n{{main|Roman army of the mid-Republic|Military of Carthage}}\n[[File:Altar Domitius Ahenobarbus Louvre n3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.55|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting two figures dressed as Roman legionaires|{{center|Detail from the [[Altar of Domitius Ahenobarbus|Ahenobarbus relief]] showing two Roman foot-soldiers from the second century BC}}]]\n\nMost male Roman citizens were eligible for military service, most would serve as infantry with a better-off minority providing a cavalry component. Traditionally the Romans would raise two [[Roman legion|legions]], each of 4,200 infantry{{#tag:ref|This could be increased to 5,000 in some circumstances.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=23}}|group=note}} and 300 cavalry. A small number of the infantry served as [[javelin]]-armed [[velites|skirmishers]]. The balance were equipped as [[heavy infantry]], with [[Body armor|body armour]], a large [[Scutum (shield)|shield]], and [[Gladius|short thrusting swords]]. They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual [[legionary|legionaries]] fought in relatively open order. An army was usually formed by combining a Roman legion with a similarly sized and equipped legion provided by their [[Socii|Latin allies]].{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=22\u201325}}\n\nCarthaginian citizens only served in their army if there was a direct threat to the city. In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} Most of the Carthaginian infantry would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]], usually forming two or three lines.{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Two thousand [[Sling (weapon)|slingers]] were recruited from the Balearic Islands.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}} The Carthaginians also employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}\n\n==Sicily 264 \u2013 256 BC==\n{{Main|Battle of Messana|Battle of Agrigentum}}\n[[File:Sicilia - prima guerra punica.svg|thumb|alt=A relief map of Sicily showing the main cities at the time of the First Punic War|{{center|Sicily, the main theater of the war}}]]\n\nMuch of the war was to be fought on, or in the waters near, Sicily. Away from the coasts its hilly and rugged terrain made manoeuvring large forces difficult and favoured the defence over the offence. Land operations were largely confined to [[Raid (military)|raid]]s, [[siege]]s and [[interdiction]]; in 23 years of war on Sicily there were only two full-scale pitched battles. Garrison duty and land [[blockade]]s were the most common operations for both armies.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}}\n\nAfter a lengthy delay,{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=72}} the land war in Sicily began with the Romans landing at Messana in 264 BC. Despite the Carthaginian naval advantage, the Roman landing was virtually unopposed.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=48\u201349}} Two legions commanded by Claudius [[Battle of Messana|disembarked at Messana]], where the Mamertines had expelled the Carthaginian garrison commanded by [[Hanno, Messana garrison commander|Hanno]] (no relation to [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno the Great]]) and were besieged by both the Carthaginians and the Syracusans.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=52}} The sources are unclear as to why, but first the Syracusans, and then the Carthaginians withdrew from the siege. The Romans marched south and in turn besieged Syracuse, but they had neither a strong enough force, nor the secure supply lines to prosecute a successful siege, and soon withdrew.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nIt was the long-standing Roman procedure to appoint two men each year, known as [[Roman consul|consuls]], to each lead an army. In 263 BC both were sent to Sicily with a force of 40,000.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=74}} After a brief siege, with no Carthaginian assistance anticipated, Syracuse made peace with the Romans; it became a Roman ally, paid an indemnity of 100 [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver{{#tag:ref|100 talents was approximately {{convert|2.6|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=off}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} and, perhaps most importantly, agreed to help supply the Roman army in Sicily.{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=71}} Following the defection of Syracuse, several other small Carthaginian dependencies switched to the Romans.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=171}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=72\u201373}} [[Agrigento|Akragas]] (Agrigentum in Latin; modern Agrigento), a port city halfway along the south coast of Sicily, was chosen by the Carthaginians as their strategic centre. The Romans marched on it in 262 BC and besieged it.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}} The Romans had an inadequate supply system, partly because the Carthaginian naval supremacy prevented them from shipped supplies by sea, and they were not in any case accustomed to feeding an army as large as 40,000 men.

The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}} The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on a captured blockade runner with especially good qualities.{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding, and with a proven vessel as a model produced high-quality quinqueremes.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=124}} Importantly, the {{lang|la|corvus}} was abandoned,{{sfn|Miles|2011|P=195}} which improved the ships' speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=150}}{{sfn|Casson|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=95}}\n\nThe Carthaginians raised a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there to use as marines. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet under [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] and [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} After achieving this decisive victory, the Romans continued their land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum and Drepana.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=125\u2013126}} The Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} Instead, it ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, which he left up to his subordinate Gesco.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} The [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end: Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Dishekel hispano-cartagin\u00e9s-2.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|alt=Image of both sides of a coin: one depicting a bearded man's head; the other a mounted elephant|{{center|A [[Carthaginian currency|Carthaginian]] [[shekel]], dated 237\u2013227 BC, depicting the Punic god [[Melqart]] (who was associated with [[Hercules]]/[[Heracles]]).

Eventually [[Mercenary War|they rebelled]] and were joined by many disgruntled local groups. They were put down with great difficulty and considerable savagery. Rome took advantage of the chaos to seize Corsica and Sardinia, in defiance of the terms of their treaty.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}} Carthage, seeking to make up for the recent territorial losses and to gain a source of silver to pay the large indemnity owed to Rome, turned its attention to [[Iberia]] (modern Spain); in 237 BC, the Carthaginians, led by Hamilcar Barca, began a [[Carthaginian Iberia#Expansion into Iberia|series of campaigns]] to expand their control over the [[peninsula]]. Though Hamilcar was killed in 229 BC, the offensive continued with the Carthaginians extending their power towards the [[Ebro valley]] and founding [[Cartagena, Spain|New Carthage]] in 228 BC.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\nFor Rome, the end of the First Punic War marked the start of its expansion beyond the Italian Peninsula. Sicily became the first [[Roman province]] as [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], governed by a former [[praetor]]. Sicily would become important to Rome as [[Grain supply to the city of Rome|a source of grain]].{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}} [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]] was granted nominal independence and ally status for the lifetime of Hiero II.{{sfn|Allen|Myers|1890|p=111}} Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The Romans had built more than 1,000 galleys during the war, and this experience of building, manning, training, supplying and maintaining such numbers of ships laid the foundation for Rome's maritime dominance for 600 years.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=128\u2013129, 357, 359\u2013360}}\n\nThe question of which state was to control the western Mediterranean remained open, and when Carthage besieged

For 23 years, in the longest continuous conflict and greatest naval war of antiquity, the two powers struggled for supremacy, primarily on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Sicily]] and its surrounding waters, and also in North Africa. After immense material and human losses on both sides the Carthaginians were defeated.\n\nThe war began in 264 BC with the Romans gaining a foothold on Sicily at [[Battle of Messana|Messana]] (modern [[Messina]]). The Romans then pressed [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the only significant independent power on the island, into allying with them and laid siege to Carthage's main base at [[Agrigento|Akragas]]. A large Carthaginian army attempted to lift the siege in 262 BC, but was heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Agrigentum|Battle of Akragas]]. The Romans then built a navy to challenge Carthage's, and using novel tactics inflicted several defeats. A Carthaginian base on [[Corsica]] was seized, but an attack on [[Sardinia]] was repulsed; the base on Corsica was then lost. Taking advantage of their naval victories the Romans launched an invasion of North Africa, which the Carthaginians intercepted. At the [[Battle of Cape Ecnomus]] the Carthaginians were again beaten; this was possibly the [[largest naval battle in history]] by the number of combatants involved. The invasion initially went well and in 255 BC the Carthaginians [[Suing for peace|sued for peace]]; the proposed terms were so harsh they fought on, [[Battle of the Bagradas River (255 BC)|defeating the invaders]]. The Romans sent a fleet to evacuate their survivors and the Carthaginians opposed it at the [[Battle of Cape Hermaeum]] off Africa; the Carthaginians were heavily defeated, losing 114 ships captured. The Roman fleet, in turn, was devastated by a storm while returning to Italy, losing 384 ships and 100,000 men.\n\nThe war continued, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, adding 220 new ships. The Carthaginians attacked and recaptured Akragas in 255 BC, but not believing they could hold the city, they razed and abandoned it. The Romans captured Panormus (modern [[Palermo]]) in 254 BC. The next year they lost another 150 ships to a storm while returning from raiding the North African coast. In 251 BC the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Panormus, but were defeated in a [[ Battle of Panormus|battle outside the walls]]. Slowly the Romans had occupied most of Sicily; in 249 BC they besieged the last two Carthaginian strongholds{{snd}}in the extreme west. They also launched a surprise attack on the Carthaginian fleet, which was defeated at the [[Battle of Drepana]]. The Carthaginians followed up their victory and another 120 Roman warships, and 800 transports, were lost at the [[ Battle of Phintias]]. After several years of stalemate, the Romans rebuilt their fleet again in 244 BC and effectively [[blockade]]d the Carthaginian garrisons. Carthage assembled a fleet which attempted to relieve them, but it was destroyed at the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands|Aegates Islands]] in 241 BC, forcing the cut-off Carthaginian troops on Sicily to negotiate for peace. \n\nThe [[Treaty of Lutatius]] was agreed. By its terms Carthage paid large [[War reparations|reparations]] and [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily was annexed]] as a [[Roman province]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The immense effort of building 1,000 galleys during the war laid the foundation for Rome's maritime dominance for 600 years. The end of the war sparked a major but unsuccessful [[Mercenary War|revolt]] within the Carthaginian Empire. The unresolved strategic competition between Rome and Carthage would lead to the eruption of the [[Second Punic War]] in 218 BC.\n\n==Sources==\n\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa|188}} BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the end of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nSince 2010, eleven bronze warship [[Naval ram|rams]] have been found by archaeologists in the sea off the west coast of Sicily, along with ten bronze helmets and hundreds of [[amphorae]].{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|Pragg|2013}}{{sfn|Murray|2019|}} The rams, seven of the helmets, and six intact amphorae, along with a large number of fragments, have since been recovered.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=12, 26, 31\u201332}} It is believed the rams were each attached to a sunken warship when they were deposited on the seabed.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=39}} The archaeologists involved stated that the location of artefacts so far discovered supports Polybius's account of where the [[Battle of the Aegates]] took place.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=35\u201336}} Based on the dimensions of the recovered rams, the archaeologists who have studied them believe they all came from [[trireme]]s, contrary to Polybius's account of all of the warships involved being [[Hellenistic-era warships#Hellenistic-era warships|quinqueremes]].{{sfn|Murray|2019|}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|pp=39\u201342}} However, they believe that the many amphorae identified confirm the accuracy of other aspects of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=46}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, terrestrial archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}}\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Carthage-1958-PortsPuniques.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A colour photograph of an urban area by the sea with a water-filled, torus-shaped inlet.|{{center|A photograph of the remains of the naval base of the city of Carthage.

During the Pyrrhic War of 280\u2013275 BC, against a king of [[Epirus]] who alternately fought Rome in Italy and Carthage on Sicily, Carthage provided [[materiel]] to the Romans and on at least one occasion used its navy to ferry a Roman force.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=94, 160, 163, 164\u2013165}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=69\u201370}}\n\nIn 288 BC, the [[Mamertines]], a group of Italian mercenaries, previously hired by Syracuse, occupied the city of Messana (modern [[Messina, Italy|Messina]]) in the north-eastern tip of Sicily.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=165}} Hard-pressed by Syracuse, the Mamertines appealed to both Rome and Carthage for assistance. The Carthaginians acted first, pressing [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero II]], king of Syracuse, into taking no further action and convincing the Mamertines to accept a Carthaginian garrison in Messana. According to Polybius, a considerable debate took place in Rome as to whether to accept the Mamertines' appeal for assistance, which could easily lead to war with Carthage. The Romans had not previously displayed any interest in Sicily and did not wish to come to the aid of soldiers who had unjustly stolen a city from its rightful possessors. However, many saw strategic and monetary advantages in gaining a foothold in Sicily. It was recognised that this step may lead to ill-feeling from Carthage, but war was considered far from inevitable. The deadlocked [[Roman Senate]] put the matter before the popular assembly, which decided to accept the Mamertines' request.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=42\u201345}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=150}}\n\n[[Appius Claudius Caudex]] was appointed commander of a military expedition with orders to cross to Messana.{{sfn|Starr|1991|p=479}}{{sfn|Warmington|1993|pp=168\u2013169}} Carthage was unperturbed.

A small number of the infantry served as [[javelin]]-armed [[velites|skirmishers]]. The balance were equipped as [[heavy infantry]], with [[Body armor|body armour]], a large [[Scutum (shield)|shield]], and [[Gladius|short thrusting swords]]. They were divided into three ranks, of which the [[hastati|front rank]] also carried two javelins, while the [[principes|second]] and [[triari|third]] ranks had a [[Hasta (spear)|thrusting spear]] instead. Both legionary [[Maniple (military unit)|sub-units]] and individual [[legionary|legionaries]] fought in relatively open order.

In most circumstances Carthage recruited foreigners to make up its army. Many would be from North Africa which provided several types of fighters including: close-order infantry equipped with large shields, helmets, short swords and long thrusting [[spear]]s; javelin-armed light infantry skirmishers; close-order shock cavalry carrying spears; and light cavalry skirmishers who threw javelins from a distance and avoided close combat.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Both Spain and [[Gaul]] provided small numbers of experienced infantry; unarmoured troops who would charge ferociously, but had a reputation for breaking off if a combat was protracted.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}{{#tag:ref|The Spanish used a heavy throwing spear which the Romans were later to adopt as the ''[[pilum]]''.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}}|group=note}} Most of the Carthaginian infantry would fight in a tightly-packed formation known as a [[phalanx]], usually forming two or three lines.{{sfn|Koon|2015|p=80}} Two thousand [[Sling (weapon)|slingers]] were recruited from the Balearic Islands.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=8}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=32}} The Carthaginians also employed [[war elephant]]s; North Africa had indigenous [[African forest elephant]]s at the time.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=9}}\n\n==Sicily 264 \u2013 256 BC==\n{{Main|Battle of Messana|Battle of Agrigentum}}\n[[File:Sicilia - prima guerra punica.svg|thumb|alt=A relief map of Sicily showing the main cities at the time of the First Punic War|{{center|Sicily, the main theater of the war}}]]\n\nMuch of the war was to be fought on, or in the waters near, Sicily. Away from the coasts its hilly and rugged terrain made manoeuvring large forces difficult and favoured the defence over the offence. Land operations were largely confined to [[Raid (military)|raid]]s, [[siege]]s and [[interdiction]]; in 23 years of war on Sicily there were only two full-scale pitched battles. Garrison duty and land [[blockade]]s were the most common operations for both armies.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}}\n\nAfter a lengthy delay,{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=72}} the land war in Sicily began with the Romans landing at Messana in 264 BC. Despite the Carthaginian naval advantage, the Roman landing was virtually unopposed.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=48\u201349}} Two legions commanded by Claudius [[Battle of Messana|disembarked at Messana]], where the Mamertines had expelled the Carthaginian garrison commanded by [[Hanno, Messana garrison commander|Hanno]] (no relation to [[Hanno the Great#Hanno II the Great|Hanno the Great]]) and were besieged by both the Carthaginians and the Syracusans.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=52}} The sources are unclear as to why, but first the Syracusans, and then the Carthaginians withdrew from the siege. The Romans marched south and in turn besieged Syracuse, but they had neither a strong enough force, nor the secure supply lines to prosecute a successful siege, and soon withdrew.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=52\u201353}}\n\nIt was the long-standing Roman procedure to appoint two men each year, known as [[Roman consul|consuls]], to each lead an army. In 263 BC both were sent to Sicily with a force of 40,000.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=74}} After a brief siege, with no Carthaginian assistance anticipated, Syracuse made peace with the Romans; it became a Roman ally, paid an indemnity of 100 [[talent (measurement)|talents]] of silver{{#tag:ref|100 talents was approximately {{convert|2.6|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=off}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} and, perhaps most importantly, agreed to help supply the Roman army in Sicily.{{sfn|Erdkamp|2015|p=71}} Following the defection of Syracuse, several other small Carthaginian dependencies switched to the Romans.{{sfn|Warmington|1993|p=171}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=72\u201373}} [[Agrigento|Akragas]] (Agrigentum in Latin; modern Agrigento), a port city halfway along the south coast of Sicily, was chosen by the Carthaginians as their strategic centre. The Romans marched on it in 262 BC and besieged it.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}} The Romans had an inadequate supply system, partly because the Carthaginian naval supremacy prevented them from shipped supplies by sea, and they were not in any case accustomed to feeding an army as large as 40,000 men. At harvest time most of the army was dispersed over a wide area to harvest the crops and to forage. The Carthaginians, commanded by [[Hannibal Gisco]], sortied in force, taking the Romans by surprise and penetrating their camp; the Romans rallied and routed the Carthaginians; after this experience both sides were more guarded.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=77}}\n\n[[Image:Romanadvance (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|upright=1|alt=a map of Sicily showing Rome and Carthage's territories, movements and the main military clashes 260\u2013256 BC|Continued Roman advance 260\u2013256 BC{{col begin}}\n{{legend|#8E2A76|Roman territory or advances (arrows)}} {{legend|#D2FDC5|Syracusan territory}}{{legend|#808080|Carthaginian territory}}{{col end}}]]\n\nMeanwhile, Carthage had recruited an army, which assembled in Africa and was shipped to Sicily.

The Romans, under both consuls{{snd}}[[Lucius Postumius Megellus (consul 262 BC)|Lucius Postumius Megellus]] and [[Quintus Mamilius Vitulus]]{{snd}} pursued, capturing the Carthaginians' elephants and [[Train (military)|baggage train]]. That night the Carthaginian garrison escaped while the Romans were distracted. The next day the Romans seized the city and its inhabitants, selling 25,000 of them into slavery.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=179\u2013180}}\n\nAfter this success for the Romans, the war became fragmented for several years, with minor successes for each side, but no clear focus. In part this was because the Romans diverted many of their resources to an ultimately fruitless campaign against Corsica and Sardinia, and then into the equally fruitless expedition to Africa.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=65}} After taking Akragas the Romans advanced westward to besiege [[Mytistraton]] for seven months, without success.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=82}} In 259 BC they advanced toward [[Termini Imerese|Thermae]] on the north coast. After a quarrel, the Roman troops and their allies set up separate camps.

To counter this, the Romans introduced the [[corvus (weapon)|''corvus'']], a bridge {{convert|1.2|m|ft|sigfig=1}} wide and {{convert|11|m|ft}} long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}} This allowed Roman legionaries acting as marines to [[Naval boarding|board enemy ships]] and capture them, rather than employing the previously [[Naval tactics in the Age of Galleys|traditional tactic]] of [[ramming]].{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=178}}\n\n[[File:Corvus.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.85|alt=A diagram showing the location and usage of a {{lang|la|corvus}} on a Roman galley.|{{center|The ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]'', the Roman [[Naval boarding|ship boarding]] device}}]]\n\nAll warships were equipped with rams, a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline.

The Carthaginian fleet was commanded by Hannibal Gisco, the general who had commanded the garrison of Akragas, and was based at Panormus, some {{convert|100|km|mi}} from Lipari. When Hannibal heard of the Romans' move he despatched 20 ships under [[Boodes]] to the town. The Carthaginians arrived at night and trapped the Romans in the harbour. Boodes' ships attacked and Scipio's inexperienced men offered little resistance. Some Romans panicked and fled inland and the Consul himself was taken prisoner.

Usually the aim is correlation, demonstrating that a particular [[Horizon (geology)|horizon]] in one geological section represents the same period of time as another horizon at some other section. The fossils are useful because [[sediment]]s of the same age can look completely different because of local variations in the [[Sedimentary depositional environment|sedimentary environment]]. For example, one section might have been made up of [[clay]]s and [[marl]]s while another has more [[chalk]]y [[limestone]]s, but if the fossil species recorded are similar, the two sediments are likely to have been laid down at the same time.\n\nBiostratigraphy originated in the early 19th century, where geologists recognized that the correlation of fossil assemblages between rocks of similar type but different age decreased as the difference in age increased.  The method was well-established before [[Charles Darwin]] explained the mechanism behind it\u2014[[evolution]].<ref>Gluyas, J. & Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ.

[[micropaleontology|Microfossils]] such as [[acritarchs]], [[chitinozoa]]ns, [[conodont]]s, [[dinoflagellate]] cysts,  [[ostracods]], [[pollen]], [[spores]] and [[foraminifera]]ns are also frequently used. Different fossils work well for sediments of different ages; [[Trilobite|trilobites]], for example, are particularly useful for sediments of [[Cambrian]] age. To work well, the fossils used must be widespread geographically, so that they can occur in many different places. They must also be short lived as a species, so that the period of time during which they could be incorporated in the sediment is relatively narrow. The longer lived the species, the poorer the stratigraphic precision, so fossils that evolve rapidly, such as ammonites, are favored over forms that evolve much more slowly, like [[nautiloid]]s.  Often biostratigraphic correlations are based on a fauna, not an individual species, as this allows greater precision. Further, if only one species is present in a sample, it can mean that (1) the strata were formed in the known fossil range of that organism; (2) that the fossil range of the organism was incompletely known, and the strata extend the known fossil range.  For instance, the presence of the trace fossil ''[[Treptichnus pedum]]'' was used to define the base of the Cambrian period, but it has since been found in older strata.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Gehling\n  | first = James\n  | last2 = Jensen\n  | first2 = S\u00f6ren\n  | last3 = Droser\n  | first3 = Mary\n  | last4 = Myrow\n  | first4 = Paul\n  | last5 = Narbonne\n  | first5 = Guy\n  | title = Burrowing below the basal Cambrian GSSP, Fortune Head, Newfoundland\n  | journal = Geological Magazine\n  | volume = 138\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 213\u2013218\n  |date=March 2001\n  | doi = 10.1017/S001675680100509X\n  | id = 1\n}}</ref>\n\nFossil assemblages were traditionally used to designate the duration of periods.

Henry, stuck in the Hohenstaufen conflict with the [[House of Welf]] until 1194, had to enforce the inheritance claims by his wife against her nephew Count [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred of Lecce]]. Henry's attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] failed at the [[Siege of Naples (1191)|siege of Naples in 1191]] due to an epidemic, and following his retreat Empress Constance was captured. Based on an enormous ransom for the release of [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]], he conquered Sicily in 1194; however, the intended unification with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ultimately failed due to the opposition of the [[Papacy]].\n\nHenry threatened to invade the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 1194 and succeeded in extracting a ransom, the [[Alamanikon]], from Emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]] in return for cancelling the invasion. In 1195 and 1196 Henry attempted to turn the Holy Roman Empire from an elective to a hereditary monarchy, the so-called ''[[Erbreichsplan]]'', but met strong resistance from the [[prince-elector]]s and abandoned the plan. Henry pledged to go on [[crusade]] in 1195 and began preparations. A revolt in Sicily was crushed in 1197. The Crusaders set sail for the [[Holy Land]] that same year but Henry died of illness at [[Messina]] on 28 September 1197 before he could join them. His death plunged the Empire into the chaos of the [[German throne dispute]] for the next 17 years.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHenry was born in autumn 1165 at the ''Valkhof'' [[Kaiserpfalz|pfalz]] of [[Nijmegen]] to Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and Beatrix of Burgundy. At the age of four his father had him [[Prince-elector|elected]] [[King of the Romans]] during a ''[[Hoftag]]'' in [[Bamberg]] at [[Pentecost]] 1169. Henry was crowned on 15 August at [[Aachen Cathedral]].<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Heart of Europe: A History of the Holy Roman Empire'', (Harvard University Press, 2016), 307.</ref><ref>John B. Freed, ''Frederick Barbarossa: The Prince and the Myth'', (Yale University Press, 2016), 351.</ref>\n\nHe accompanied his father on his [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italian]] campaign of 1174-76 against the [[Lombard League]], whereby he was educated by [[Godfrey of Viterbo]] and associated with [[Minnesang|minnesingers]] like [[Friedrich von Hausen]], [[Bligger von Steinach]], and [[Bernger von Horheim]]. Henry was fluent in [[Latin]] and, according to the chronicler [[Alberic of Trois-Fontaines]], was \"distinguished by gifts of knowledge, wreathed in flowers of eloquence, and learned in canon and Roman law\". He was a patron of poets and poetry, and he almost certainly composed the song ''Kaiser Heinrich'', now among the [[Weingarten Abbey|Weingarten]] Song Manuscripts. According to his rank and with [[Reichsadler|Imperial Eagle]] (''Reichsadler''), [[Imperial regalia|regalia]], and a scroll, he is the first and foremost to be portrayed in the famous ''[[Codex Manesse]]'', a 14th-century songbook manuscript featuring 140 reputed poets; at least three poems are attributed to a young and romantically minded Henry VI. In one of those he describes a romance that makes him forget all his earthly power, and neither riches nor royal dignity can outweigh his yearning for that lady (''\u00ea ich mich ir verzige, ich verzige mich \u00ea der kr\u00f4ne'' \u2013 before I give her up, I'd rather give up the crown).\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=  \n|align=center\n|width=160\n|File:Arms of Swabia.svg|Arms of the House of Hohenstaufen.\n|File:Arms of the Holy Roman Emperor (Hohenstaufen).svg|Arms of the House of Hohenstaufen as Holy Roman Emperor.\n|File:Attributed Coat and Shield of Arms of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (Codex Manesse).svg|Attributed coat of arms of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (''Codex Manesse'').\n}}\n\n===Emperor's son===\nHaving returned to [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] in 1178, Henry supported his father against insurgent Duke [[Henry the Lion]].

Constance, almost 30-year-old, was said to have been confined in [[Santissimo Salvatore, Palermo]] as a nun since childhood to keep [[celibacy]] due to a prediction that \"her marriage would destroy Sicily\" despite having become the sole legitimate heir to William as the marriage of the latter had remained childless; and, after the latter's death in November 1189, Henry had the opportunity of adding the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicilian]] crown to the imperial one. He and Constance were married on 27 January 1186 in [[Milan]].<ref>''The Marriage of Henry VI and Constance of Sicily: Prelude and Consequences'', Walter Frohlich, '''Anglo~Norman Studies: XV. Proceedings of the Battle Conference''', ed. Marjorie Chibnall, (The Boydell Press, 1993), 109.</ref>\n\nIn the Hohenstaufen conflict with [[Pope Urban III]], Henry moved to the [[March of Tuscany]], and with the aid of his deputy [[Markward von Annweiler]] devastated the adjacent territory of the [[Papal States]]. Back in Germany, he became sovereign ruler of the Empire, as his father had died while on the [[Third Crusade]] in 1190. Henry tried to secure his rule in the [[Low Countries]] by elevating Count [[Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut|Baldwin V of Hainaut]] to a [[margrave]] of [[County of Namur|Namur]], and at the same time he tried to reach a settlement with rivalling Duke [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Henry of Brabant]]. Further difficulties arose when the exiled Welf duke [[Henry the Lion]] returned from [[Kingdom of England|England]] and began to subdue large estates in his former [[Duchy of Saxony]]. A Hohenstaufen campaign to Saxony had to be abandoned when King Henry received the message of the death of King William II of Sicily on 18 November 1189. The Sicilian vice-chancellor [[Matthew of Ajello]] pursued the succession of Count Tancred of Lecce and gained the support of the [[Roman Curia]].\n\nTo assert his own rights in the inheritance dispute, Henry initially supported Tancred's rival Count [[Roger of Andria]] and made arrangements for a campaign to Italy. The next year he concluded a peace agreement with Henry the Lion at [[Fulda]] and moved farther southwards to [[Augsburg]], where he learned that his father had died on crusade attempting to cross the [[G\u00f6ksu|Saleph]] River near [[Silifke|Seleucia]] in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Kingdom of Cilicia]] (now part of [[Turkey]]) on 10 June 1190.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\">{{cite book|author=Horst Fuhrmann|title=Germany in the High Middle Ages: C.1050-1200 - pp. 181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hlapxde55rAC|date=9 October 1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31980-5}}</ref>\n\n===Imperial coronation===\n[[File:Friedrich-barbarossa-und-soehne-welfenchronik 1-1000x1540.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Barbarossa with his sons Henry and Frederick, ''Historia Welforum'', Weingarten Abbey, c. 1180]]\n[[File:Pope Coelestinus 4. crowning the Emperour Henricus 6. with his feete.gif|thumb|[[Pope Celestine III]] crowning Henry VI with his feet. He was only crowned after promising to cede [[Tusculum]].]]\nWhile he sent an Imperial army to Italy, Henry initially stayed in Germany to settle the succession of [[Louis III, Landgrave of Thuringia]], who had also died on the Third Crusade. He had planned to seize the [[Thuringia]]n landgraviate as a reverted fief, but Louis' brother [[Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia|Hermann]] was able to reach his enfeoffment. The next year, the king followed his army across the [[Alps]]. In [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]] he negotiated with [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], widow of King [[Henry II of England]], to break the engagement of her son King Richard with [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Alys]], a daughter of late King [[Louis VII of France]]. He hoped to deteriorate English-French relations and to isolate Richard, who had offended him by backing Count Tancred in Sicily. Eleanor acted cleverly; she reached Henry's assurance that he would not interfere in her son's conflict with King [[Philip II of France]], and she would also prevent the marriage of Henry's younger brother [[Conrad II, Duke of Swabia|Conrad]] with [[Berengaria of Castile]] to confine the Hohenstaufen claims to power.\n\nHenry entered into further negotiations with the Lombard League cities and with [[Pope Celestine III]] on his [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial coronation]], and ceded [[Tusculum]] to the Pope. At Easter Monday on 15 April 1191, in [[Rome]], Henry and his consort Constance were crowned Emperor and Empress by Celestine. The crown of Sicily, however, was harder to gain, as the Sicilian nobility had chosen Count Tancred of Lecce as their king. Henry began his work campaigning in [[Apulia]] and besieging Naples, but he encountered resistance when Tancred's vassal [[Margaritus of Brindisi]] came to the city's defence, harassed Henry's [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, and nearly destroyed the later arriving [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] contingent. Moreover, the Imperial army had been heavily hit by an epidemic, and Henry ultimately had to abandon the siege. Upon his retreat, those cities that had surrendered to Henry resubmitted to Tancred. As a result, Constance, who was left in the palace of [[Salerno]] as a sign that Henry would soon return, was betrayed and handed over to Tancred.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\nHenry had to return to Germany when he learned that Henry the Lion had again incited a conflict with the Saxon [[House of Ascania]] and the [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Counts of Schauenburg]]. His son [[Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Henry of Brunswick]] deserted from the Imperial army in Italy and was ostracized by the emperor at the ''Hoftag'' in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] at Pentecost 1192. However, Henry VI had to realise that his powers were limited: after his closest ally in Saxony, Archbishop [[Wichmann von Seeburg|Wichmann of Magdeburg]] died, he concluded another armistice with inflammatory Henry the Lion.\n\nMeanwhile, despite the fact that his wife had been captured by Sicilians, Henry refused Celestine III's offers to make peace with Tancred. While Tancred would not permit Constance to be ransomed unless Henry recognized him, Henry complained of her capture to Celestine. In June 1192 Constance was released on the intervention of Pope Celestine III, who in return recognized Tancred as King of Sicily. Constance was to be sent to Rome for Celestine III to put pressure on Henry, but German soldiers managed to set up an ambush on the border of Papal States and freed Constance.\n\n[[File:Heinrich 6 sigillum.jpg|thumb|Facsimile of the Imperial seal (1192)]]\n\nOn the other hand, the emperor was able to strengthen his power base in the [[Duchy of Swabia]], when he inherited the possessions of Henry the Lion's cousin [[Welf VI]]. During the election of a new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of L\u00fcttich]] he favored [[Albert de Rethel]] for Albert was a maternal-uncle of then-captive Empress Constance, whom both he and Constance had planned to be the next bishop of Liege, but the other candidate [[Albert of Louvain]] the brother of Duke Henry of Brabant gained more support. In January 1192 Henry claimed the election was under dispute and appointed his newly-made imperial chancellor [[Lothar of Hochstaden]], provost of the church of St Cassius in Bonn and brother of Count Dietrich of Hochstaden instead, and in September 1192 he proceeded to [[Li\u00e8ge|L\u00fcttich]] (Li\u00e8ge) to enforce the succession. The majority of the electors of Li\u00e8ge accepted the imperial decision because of the emperor's threat, and Albert de Rethel also relinquished and indignantly refused a financial settlement offered by the emperor. Albert of Louvain had to yield and sought support from the pope in Rome and from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Archbishop of Reims]]. In [[Reims]], he took the holy orders with papal consent, but he was killed soon after by hired assassins. His brother Duke Henry chose to conclude a peace agreement with the emperor but remained a bitter enemy.\n\nEmperor Henry already was concerned with the deposition of the Welf supporter Archbishop [[Hartwig of Uthlede|Hartwig II of Bremen]]. He further had to arbitrate in a conflict in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] on the eastern border of the Empire, where the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margrave [[Albert I, Margrave of Meissen|Albert I]] had to fend off the claims raised by his brother [[Theodoric I, Margrave of Meissen|Theoderic]] and Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia. Meanwhile, the opposition in the west took on a dramatic scale, when the dukes of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] joined forces with Archbishop [[Bruno III of Berg|Bruno III of Cologne]]. A massive confederacy against the emperor loomed ahead, including Archbishop [[Conrad of Wittelsbach|Conrad of Mainz]], Archchancellor of Germany, and Duke [[Ottokar I of Bohemia]], as well Henry's old rival Henry the Lion, the Swabian [[House of Z\u00e4hringen]], the [[Kingdom of England|English Crown]], and the pope, irritated by the killing of Albert of Louvain.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\n===Capture of Richard the Lionheart===\n[[File:Heinrich VI. begnadigt Richard Loewenherz.jpg|thumb|Richard the Lionheart submits himself to Emperor Henry, ''Liber ad honorem Augusti'', fol. 129R]]\nAt this stage, Henry had a stroke of good fortune when the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] duke [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V of Austria]] gave him his prominent prisoner, [[Richard the Lionheart]], King of England, whom he had captured on his way back from the Third Crusade and arrested at [[Burgruine D\u00fcrnstein|D\u00fcrnstein Castle]]. On 28 March 1193, Richard was handed over to the emperor in [[Speyer]] and imprisoned at [[Trifels Castle]], taking revenge for Richard's alliance with Tancred of Lecce. Ignoring his nearly [[excommunication]] by Pope Celestine III for imprisoning a former crusader, he held the English King for a ransom of 150,000 silver marks and officially declared a dowry of Richard's niece [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor]], who was to marry Duke Leopold's son [[Frederick I, Duke of Austria (Babenberg)|Frederick]]. The opposition [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] had to face the defeat of their mighty ally and to refrain from their plans to overthrow the Hohenstaufen dynasty.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historyscotland.com/history/on-this-day-in-history-richard-the-lionheart-was-captured-by-leopold/ |title=On this day in history - Richard the Lionheart was captured by Leopold V of Austria |publisher=  History Scotland  |author= |date=December 20, 2011  |accessdate=February 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nBacked by his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, who successfully defended his interests against his rivaling brother [[John, King of England|John Lackland]] and his ally King Philip of France, King Richard procured his release in exchange for the huge ransom, a further interest payment, and his [[oath of allegiance]] to Henry. In turn the emperor under threat of military violence demanded the restitution of the French lands, which John had seized upon approval by Philip during Richard's absence. Henry not only gained another vassal and ally, he could also assume the role of a mediator between [[England]] and [[France]]. He and Richard ceremoniously reconciled at the ''Hoftag'' in Speyer during Holy Week 1194: the English King publicly regretted any hostilities, genuflected, and cast himself on the emperor's mercy. He was released and returned to England.<ref name=\"Purser2004\">{{cite book|author=Toby Purser|title=Medieval England, 1042-1228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBs0VlTA-qEC|year=2004|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-32760-6}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Henry settled the longstanding conflict with the Welf dynasty when he secured the marriage of [[Agnes of Hohenstaufen]], daughter of his cousin Count Palatine [[Conrad, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Conrad]], to Henry the Lion's son Henry of Brunswick, followed by a peace agreement in March 1194.\n\n===Conquest of Sicily===\n[[File:Jind\u0159ich VI. obl\u00e9h\u00e1 Neapol (1191).jpg|thumb|left|Siege of Naples, [[Peter of Eboli]], ''[[Liber ad honorem Augusti]]'', 1196]]\n[[File:Woodcut illustration of Constance of Sicily, her husband HRE Henry VI and her son HRE Frederick II - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumb|Woodcut, depicting [[Constance of Sicily]], husband Henry VI and son [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]]]\nMeanwhile, the situation in Southern Italy had grown worse: After Henry's defeat at Naples, Tancred's brother-in-law Count [[Richard, Count of Acerra|Richard of Acerra]] had reconquered large parts of Apulia, and Tancred himself had reached the allowance of his claims by the pope. Henry was granted free passage in Northern Italy, having forged an alliance with the Lombard communes. In February 1194, Tancred of Lecce died, leaving as heir a young boy, [[William III of Sicily|William III]], under the tutelage of his mother [[Sibylla of Acerra]]. In May Emperor Henry, based on King Richard's ransom, again set out for Italy. He reached Milan at Pentecost and occupied Naples in August. He met little resistance and on 20 November 1194 entered [[Palermo]] capital of Kingdom of Sicily and was crowned king on 25 December. On the next day his wife Constance, who had stayed back in [[Iesi]], gave birth to his only son and heir [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the future emperor and king of Sicily and Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\nThe young William and his mother Sibylla had fled to [[Caltabellotta]] Castle; he officially renounced the Sicilian kingdom in turn for the [[County of Lecce]] and the [[Principality of Capua]]. A few days after Henry's coronation, however, the royal family and several Norman nobles were accused of a coup attempt and arrested. Henry is said to have had William blinded and castrated, while many of his liensmen{{cfn|date=November 2019}} were [[death by burning|burned alive]]. Some, however, like the Siculo-Greek [[Eugene of Palermo]], transitioned into the new Hohenstaufen government with ease. William probably was deported to [[Hohenems|Altems]] (Hohenems) Castle in Swabia, where he died in captivity about 1198. To take revenge of the capture of his wife Henry hanged [[Richard, Count of Acerra]] brother of Sibylla in 1196.\n\nIn March 1195 Henry held a ''Hoftag'' in [[Bari]] and appointed his wife Constance Sicilian [[queen regnant]], though with Henry's liensman{{cfn|date=November 2019}} [[Conrad I, Duke of Spoleto|Conrad of Urslingen]], elevated to a hereditary [[Duchy of Spoleto|Duke of Spoleto]], as [[Imperial vicar]] to secure the emperor's position in Southern Italy. He placed further ''[[ministerialis|ministeriales]]'' in the Sicilian administration, like the [[Troia, Apulia|Troia]] bishop [[Walter of Palearia]] who became chancellor. His loyal henchman Markward von Annweiler was appointed a Duke of [[Ravenna]], placing him in a highly strategic position to control the route to Sicily via the Italian [[Romagna]] region and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. Henry's younger brother [[Philip of Swabia]] was vested with the large estates of late Margravine [[Matilda of Tuscany|Matilda]] in [[March of Tuscany|Tuscany]]. The emperor also felt strong enough to send home the Pisan and Genoese ships without giving their governments the promised concessions.<ref name=\"Matthew1992\">{{cite book|author=Donald Matthew|title=The Norman Kingdom of Sicily - p. 290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQfub3l_ejkC|date=30 July 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-26911-7}}</ref>\n\n===Universal ruler===\n[[File:Codex Manesse Heinrich VI. (HRR).jpg|thumb|Portrait from the ''[[Codex Manesse]]'', {{circa}} 1304]]\nAt that point, Emperor Henry was the most powerful monarch in the Mediterranean and Europe, since the Sicilian kingdom added to his personal and Imperial revenues an income without parallel in Europe. However, his aims to integrate Sicily into the Empire as a second power base of the Hohenstaufen dynasty were not realised during his lifetime. The negotiations with Pope Celestine III to approve the unification (''unio regni ad imperium'') in return of another [[Crusade of 1197|crusade]] reached a deadlock. On the other hand, his beliefs of a universal rule according to the ''[[translatio imperii]]'' concept collided with the existence of the [[Byzantine Empire]], reflected in Henry's expansionist policies by forging alliances with King [[Leo I, King of Armenia|Leo I of Armenia]] and King [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Aimery of Cyprus]].\n\nIn 1195 Henry's envoys in [[Constantinople]] raised claims to former [[Italo-Norman]] possessions around [[Durr\u00ebs|Dyrrachium]] (Durr\u00ebs), one of the most important naval bases on the eastern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, and pressed for a contribution to the planned crusade. Upon the deposition of Emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]] Henry openly threatened with an attack on Byzantine territory. He already evolved plans to betroth his younger brother Philip to Isaac's daughter Princess [[Irene Angelina]] \u2014deliberately or not\u2014 opening up a perspective to unite the Western and Eastern Empire under Hohenstaufen rule. According to the contemporary historian [[Niketas Choniates]] his legates were able to collect [[Alamanikon|a large tribute]] from Isaac's brother and successor [[Alexios III Angelos|Alexios III]], which, however, was not paid before Henry's death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/6w924c14h |title=Byzantium confronts the West, 1180-1204 |publisher=  History Scotland  |author=Charles M.

However, he first again had to deal with the quarrels in the Wettin Margraviate of Meissen upon the death of Margrave Albert I. As Albert had tried to gain control over the adjacent [[Pleissnerland]], an Imperial Hohenstaufen territory, Henry took the occasion to deny the inheritance claims of the margrave's younger brother Theodoric and seized the Meissen territory for himself. In October he reconciled with Archbishop Hartwig of Bremen at [[Gelnhausen]] and was able to obtain the support of numerous Saxon and Thuringian nobles for his crusade which was scheduled to begin on Christmas 1196.\n\nHis next aim was to make the imperial crown [[Erbreichsplan|hereditary]]. Henry tried to secure the Imperial election of his son Frederick II as King of the Romans, which however met with objections raised by Archbishop [[Adolf of Altena|Adolf of Cologne]]. Spending the winter in [[Hagenau]] Castle, the emperor and his ''ministeriales'' evolved the idea of a hereditary monarchy. Though they would have lost their right to elect the kings, the secular princes themselves wished to make their Imperial fiefs hereditary and to be inheritable by the female line as well, and Henry agreed to consider these demands. The emperor also bought the support of ecclesiastical princes by announcing that he would be willing to give up the ''[[Jus Spolii]]'' and the right to receive recurring earnings from church lands during a period of ''[[sede vacante]]''. At the Diet of [[W\u00fcrzburg]], held in March/April 1196, he managed to convince the majority of the princes to vote for his proposal. However, Archbishop Adolf of Cologne did not even put in an appearance and several princes, predominantly in Saxony and Thuringia, were still dissatisfied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://file.upi.edu/Direktori/FPBS/JUR._PEND._BAHASA_JERMAN/196111101985031-AMIR/Bahan_Ajar_dan_Silabus_Deutsche_Geschichte_2010/Sailer_und_Staufer.pdf |title= Hochmittelalter |publisher=  UPI |author=Alfred Haverkamp |date=  |accessdate=February 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nWhile in July 1196 Henry proceeded to Burgundy and Italy in order to negotiate with Pope Celestine III, the resistance in Germany grew. At the following diet at [[Erfurt]] in October, a majority of the princes rejected the emperor's plans. Furthermore, the Pope, still concerned in view of the Hohenstaufen rule over Sicily, broke off the talks. Nevertheless, on Christmas Henry's son Frederick II was elected King of the Romans in Frankfurt.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:DSC00548 - Cattedrale - Tomba di Enrico VI + 1197 - Foto G.

He entered Sicily in March 1197 and applied himself to prepare his crusade in [[Messina]].\n\nSoon after, the tyrannical power of the foreign King in Italy spurred a revolt, especially around [[Catania]] and southern Sicily, which his German soldiers led by Markward of Annweiler and [[Henry of Kalden]] suppressed mercilessly. The rebels even sought to make Count [[Jordan Lupinus|Jordan of Bovino]] king in Henry's place.

His travel routes through Germany as well as his campaigns in Italy are documented by numerous deeds he issued year by year.\n\nThe emperor strongly relied on high-ranking clergy like the archbishops [[Philip I (archbishop of Cologne)|Philip of Cologne]] and [[Conrad of Wittelsbach|Conrad of Mainz]]. Several contemporary accounts of his life given by ecclesiastical chroniclers like [[Godfrey of Viterbo]] or [[Peter of Eboli]] in his ''[[Liber ad honorem Augusti]]'' (on the emperor's conquest of Sicily) paint a bright picture of Henry's rule; while the annals by [[Otto of Sankt Blasien]] are considered more objective. In his ''[[Arnoldi Chronica Slavorum]]'' the chronicler [[Arnold of L\u00fcbeck]] concentrates on the dispute between the Hohenstaufen and Welf dynasties from a pronounced Welf perspective, while [[Gislebert of Mons]] tells of Henry's policies in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. The Hohenstaufen rule in Italy and the Meezogiorno is documented by the chronicles of Archbishop [[Romuald Guarna|Romuald of Salerno]] and [[Richard of San Germano]]. Henry's conflict with King Richard I of England is rendered by [[Roger of Hoveden]] and [[Gervase of Tilbury]], expressing their negative attitudes towards the emperor.\n\nLater historians stressed the fact of Henry's early death and the succeeding throne quarrel as a stroke of fate and a major setback for the development of a German [[nation state]] begun under his father Frederick Barbarossa. On the other hand, the emperor's stern measures in Sicily earned him the reputation of a cruel and merciless ruler. Present-day historical research classifies Henry as a man of his time; though a capable ruler he had to cope with the centrifugal forces of the disintegrating empire while at the same time he overstretched the Hohenstaufen realm to an extent that finally could not be kept together.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

From 1194 he was also [[King of Sicily]].\n\nHe was the second son of Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]] and his consort [[Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy|Beatrix of Burgundy]]. In 1186 he was married to [[Constance, Queen of Sicily|Constance of Sicily]], the posthumous daughter of the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman]] king [[Roger II of Sicily]]. Henry, stuck in the Hohenstaufen conflict with the [[House of Welf]] until 1194, had to enforce the inheritance claims by his wife against her nephew Count [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred of Lecce]]. Henry's attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] failed at the [[Siege of Naples (1191)|siege of Naples in 1191]] due to an epidemic, and following his retreat Empress Constance was captured. Based on an enormous ransom for the release of [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]], he conquered Sicily in 1194; however, the intended unification with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ultimately failed due to the opposition of the [[Papacy]].\n\nHenry threatened to invade the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 1194 and succeeded in extracting a ransom, the [[Alamanikon]], from Emperor [[Alexios III Angelos]] in return for cancelling the invasion. In 1195 and 1196 Henry attempted to turn the Holy Roman Empire from an elective to a hereditary monarchy, the so-called ''[[Erbreichsplan]]'', but met strong resistance from the [[prince-elector]]s and abandoned the plan. Henry pledged to go on [[crusade]] in 1195 and began preparations. A revolt in Sicily was crushed in 1197. The Crusaders set sail for the [[Holy Land]] that same year but Henry died of illness at [[Messina]] on 28 September 1197 before he could join them. His death plunged the Empire into the chaos of the [[German throne dispute]] for the next 17 years.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHenry was born in autumn 1165 at the ''Valkhof'' [[Kaiserpfalz|pfalz]] of [[Nijmegen]] to Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and Beatrix of Burgundy. At the age of four his father had him [[Prince-elector|elected]] [[King of the Romans]] during a ''[[Hoftag]]'' in [[Bamberg]] at [[Pentecost]] 1169. Henry was crowned on 15 August at [[Aachen Cathedral]].<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Heart of Europe: A History of the Holy Roman Empire'', (Harvard University Press, 2016), 307.</ref><ref>John B. Freed, ''Frederick Barbarossa: The Prince and the Myth'', (Yale University Press, 2016), 351.</ref>\n\nHe accompanied his father on his [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italian]] campaign of 1174-76 against the [[Lombard League]], whereby he was educated by [[Godfrey of Viterbo]] and associated with [[Minnesang|minnesingers]] like [[Friedrich von Hausen]], [[Bligger von Steinach]], and [[Bernger von Horheim]]. Henry was fluent in [[Latin]] and, according to the chronicler [[Alberic of Trois-Fontaines]], was \"distinguished by gifts of knowledge, wreathed in flowers of eloquence, and learned in canon and Roman law\". He was a patron of poets and poetry, and he almost certainly composed the song ''Kaiser Heinrich'', now among the [[Weingarten Abbey|Weingarten]] Song Manuscripts. According to his rank and with [[Reichsadler|Imperial Eagle]] (''Reichsadler''), [[Imperial regalia|regalia]], and a scroll, he is the first and foremost to be portrayed in the famous ''[[Codex Manesse]]'', a 14th-century songbook manuscript featuring 140 reputed poets; at least three poems are attributed to a young and romantically minded Henry VI. In one of those he describes a romance that makes him forget all his earthly power, and neither riches nor royal dignity can outweigh his yearning for that lady (''\u00ea ich mich ir verzige, ich verzige mich \u00ea der kr\u00f4ne'' \u2013 before I give her up, I'd rather give up the crown).\n\n{{Gallery\n|title=  \n|align=center\n|width=160\n|File:Arms of Swabia.svg|Arms of the House of Hohenstaufen.\n|File:Arms of the Holy Roman Emperor (Hohenstaufen).svg|Arms of the House of Hohenstaufen as Holy Roman Emperor.\n|File:Attributed Coat and Shield of Arms of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (Codex Manesse).svg|Attributed coat of arms of Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor (''Codex Manesse'').\n}}\n\n===Emperor's son===\nHaving returned to [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] in 1178, Henry supported his father against insurgent Duke [[Henry the Lion]].

Constance, almost 30-year-old, was said to have been confined in [[Santissimo Salvatore, Palermo]] as a nun since childhood to keep [[celibacy]] due to a prediction that \"her marriage would destroy Sicily\" despite having become the sole legitimate heir to William as the marriage of the latter had remained childless; and, after the latter's death in November 1189, Henry had the opportunity of adding the [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicilian]] crown to the imperial one. He and Constance were married on 27 January 1186 in [[Milan]].<ref>''The Marriage of Henry VI and Constance of Sicily: Prelude and Consequences'', Walter Frohlich, '''Anglo~Norman Studies: XV. Proceedings of the Battle Conference''', ed. Marjorie Chibnall, (The Boydell Press, 1993), 109.</ref>\n\nIn the Hohenstaufen conflict with [[Pope Urban III]], Henry moved to the [[March of Tuscany]], and with the aid of his deputy [[Markward von Annweiler]] devastated the adjacent territory of the [[Papal States]]. Back in Germany, he became sovereign ruler of the Empire, as his father had died while on the [[Third Crusade]] in 1190. Henry tried to secure his rule in the [[Low Countries]] by elevating Count [[Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut|Baldwin V of Hainaut]] to a [[margrave]] of [[County of Namur|Namur]], and at the same time he tried to reach a settlement with rivalling Duke [[Henry I, Duke of Brabant|Henry of Brabant]]. Further difficulties arose when the exiled Welf duke [[Henry the Lion]] returned from [[Kingdom of England|England]] and began to subdue large estates in his former [[Duchy of Saxony]]. A Hohenstaufen campaign to Saxony had to be abandoned when King Henry received the message of the death of King William II of Sicily on 18 November 1189. The Sicilian vice-chancellor [[Matthew of Ajello]] pursued the succession of Count Tancred of Lecce and gained the support of the [[Roman Curia]].\n\nTo assert his own rights in the inheritance dispute, Henry initially supported Tancred's rival Count [[Roger of Andria]] and made arrangements for a campaign to Italy. The next year he concluded a peace agreement with Henry the Lion at [[Fulda]] and moved farther southwards to [[Augsburg]], where he learned that his father had died on crusade attempting to cross the [[G\u00f6ksu|Saleph]] River near [[Silifke|Seleucia]] in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Kingdom of Cilicia]] (now part of [[Turkey]]) on 10 June 1190.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\">{{cite book|author=Horst Fuhrmann|title=Germany in the High Middle Ages: C.1050-1200 - pp. 181|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hlapxde55rAC|date=9 October 1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-31980-5}}</ref>\n\n===Imperial coronation===\n[[File:Friedrich-barbarossa-und-soehne-welfenchronik 1-1000x1540.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Barbarossa with his sons Henry and Frederick, ''Historia Welforum'', Weingarten Abbey, c. 1180]]\n[[File:Pope Coelestinus 4. crowning the Emperour Henricus 6. with his feete.gif|thumb|[[Pope Celestine III]] crowning Henry VI with his feet. He was only crowned after promising to cede [[Tusculum]].]]\nWhile he sent an Imperial army to Italy, Henry initially stayed in Germany to settle the succession of [[Louis III, Landgrave of Thuringia]], who had also died on the Third Crusade. He had planned to seize the [[Thuringia]]n landgraviate as a reverted fief, but Louis' brother [[Hermann I, Landgrave of Thuringia|Hermann]] was able to reach his enfeoffment. The next year, the king followed his army across the [[Alps]]. In [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]] he negotiated with [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], widow of King [[Henry II of England]], to break the engagement of her son King Richard with [[Alys, Countess of the Vexin|Alys]], a daughter of late King [[Louis VII of France]]. He hoped to deteriorate English-French relations and to isolate Richard, who had offended him by backing Count Tancred in Sicily. Eleanor acted cleverly; she reached Henry's assurance that he would not interfere in her son's conflict with King [[Philip II of France]], and she would also prevent the marriage of Henry's younger brother [[Conrad II, Duke of Swabia|Conrad]] with [[Berengaria of Castile]] to confine the Hohenstaufen claims to power.\n\nHenry entered into further negotiations with the Lombard League cities and with [[Pope Celestine III]] on his [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial coronation]], and ceded [[Tusculum]] to the Pope. At Easter Monday on 15 April 1191, in [[Rome]], Henry and his consort Constance were crowned Emperor and Empress by Celestine. The crown of Sicily, however, was harder to gain, as the Sicilian nobility had chosen Count Tancred of Lecce as their king. Henry began his work campaigning in [[Apulia]] and besieging Naples, but he encountered resistance when Tancred's vassal [[Margaritus of Brindisi]] came to the city's defence, harassed Henry's [[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, and nearly destroyed the later arriving [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] contingent. Moreover, the Imperial army had been heavily hit by an epidemic, and Henry ultimately had to abandon the siege. Upon his retreat, those cities that had surrendered to Henry resubmitted to Tancred. As a result, Constance, who was left in the palace of [[Salerno]] as a sign that Henry would soon return, was betrayed and handed over to Tancred.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\nHenry had to return to Germany when he learned that Henry the Lion had again incited a conflict with the Saxon [[House of Ascania]] and the [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Counts of Schauenburg]]. His son [[Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Henry of Brunswick]] deserted from the Imperial army in Italy and was ostracized by the emperor at the ''Hoftag'' in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] at Pentecost 1192. However, Henry VI had to realise that his powers were limited: after his closest ally in Saxony, Archbishop [[Wichmann von Seeburg|Wichmann of Magdeburg]] died, he concluded another armistice with inflammatory Henry the Lion.\n\nMeanwille, despite his wife had been captured by Sicilians, Henry always refused Celestine III making peace with Tancred. While Tancred would not permit Constance to be ransomed unless Henry recognized him, Henry complained her capture to Celestine. In June 1192 Constance was released on the intervention of Pope Celestine III, who in return recognized Tancred as King of Sicily. Constance was to be sent to Rome for Celestine III to put pressure on Henry, but German soldiers managed to set up an ambush on the border of Papal States, releasing Constance.\n\n[[File:Heinrich 6 sigillum.jpg|thumb|Facsimile of the Imperial seal (1192)]]\n\nOn the other hand, the emperor was able to strengthen his power base in the [[Duchy of Swabia]], when he inherited the possessions of Henry the Lion's cousin [[Welf VI]]. During the election of a new [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Li\u00e8ge|Bishop of L\u00fcttich]] he favored [[Albert de Rethel]] for Albert was a maternal-uncle of then-captive Empress Constance, whom both he and Constance had planned to be the next bishop of Liege, but the other candidate [[Albert of Louvain]] the brother of Duke Henry of Brabant gained more support. In January 1192 Henry claimed the election was under dispute and appointed his newly-made imperial chancellor [[Lothar of Hochstaden]], provost of the church of St Cassius in Bonn and brother of Count Dietrich of Hochstaden instead, and in September 1192 he proceeded to [[Li\u00e8ge|L\u00fcttich]] (Li\u00e8ge) to enforce the succession. The majority of the electors of Li\u00e8ge accepted the imperial decision because of the emperor's threat, and Albert de Rethel also relinquished and indignantly refused a financial settlement offered by the emperor. Albert of Louvain had to yield and sought support from the pope in Rome and from the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Archbishop of Reims]]. In [[Reims]], he took the holy orders with papal consent, but he was killed soon after by hired assassins. His brother Duke Henry chose to conclude a peace agreement with the emperor but remained a bitter enemy.\n\nEmperor Henry already was concerned with the deposition of the Welf supporter Archbishop [[Hartwig of Uthlede|Hartwig II of Bremen]]. He further had to arbitrate in a conflict in the [[Margraviate of Meissen]] on the eastern border of the Empire, where the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] margrave [[Albert I, Margrave of Meissen|Albert I]] had to fend off the claims raised by his brother [[Theodoric I, Margrave of Meissen|Theoderic]] and Landgrave Hermann of Thuringia. Meanwhile, the opposition in the west took on a dramatic scale, when the dukes of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and [[Duchy of Limburg|Limburg]] joined forces with Archbishop [[Bruno III of Berg|Bruno III of Cologne]]. A massive confederacy against the emperor loomed ahead, including Archbishop [[Conrad of Wittelsbach|Conrad of Mainz]], Archchancellor of Germany, and Duke [[Ottokar I of Bohemia]], as well Henry's old rival Henry the Lion, the Swabian [[House of Z\u00e4hringen]], the [[Kingdom of England|English Crown]], and the pope, irritated by the killing of Albert of Louvain.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\n===Capture of Richard the Lionheart===\n[[File:Heinrich VI. begnadigt Richard Loewenherz.jpg|thumb|Richard the Lionheart submits himself to Emperor Henry, ''Liber ad honorem Augusti'', fol. 129R]]\nAt this stage, Henry had a stroke of good fortune when the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] duke [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V of Austria]] gave him his prominent prisoner, [[Richard the Lionheart]], King of England, whom he had captured on his way back from the Third Crusade and arrested at [[Burgruine D\u00fcrnstein|D\u00fcrnstein Castle]]. On 28 March 1193, Richard was handed over to the emperor in [[Speyer]] and imprisoned at [[Trifels Castle]], taking revenge for Richard's alliance with Tancred of Lecce. Ignoring his nearly [[excommunication]] by Pope Celestine III for imprisoning a former crusader, he held the English King for a ransom of 150,000 silver marks and officially declared a dowry of Richard's niece [[Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany|Eleanor]], who was to marry Duke Leopold's son [[Frederick I, Duke of Austria (Babenberg)|Frederick]]. The opposition [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] had to face the defeat of their mighty ally and to refrain from their plans to overthrow the Hohenstaufen dynasty.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historyscotland.com/history/on-this-day-in-history-richard-the-lionheart-was-captured-by-leopold/ |title=On this day in history - Richard the Lionheart was captured by Leopold V of Austria |publisher=  History Scotland  |author= |date=December 20, 2011  |accessdate=February 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nBacked by his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, who successfully defended his interests against his rivaling brother [[John, King of England|John Lackland]] and his ally King Philip of France, King Richard procured his release in exchange for the huge ransom, a further interest payment, and his [[oath of allegiance]] to Henry. In turn the emperor under threat of military violence demanded the restitution of the French lands, which John had seized upon approval by Philip during Richard's absence. Henry not only gained another vassal and ally, he could also assume the role of a mediator between [[England]] and [[France]]. He and Richard ceremoniously reconciled at the ''Hoftag'' in Speyer during Holy Week 1194: the English King publicly regretted any hostilities, genuflected, and cast himself on the emperor's mercy. He was released and returned to England.<ref name=\"Purser2004\">{{cite book|author=Toby Purser|title=Medieval England, 1042-1228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBs0VlTA-qEC|year=2004|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-32760-6}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Henry settled the longstanding conflict with the Welf dynasty when he secured the marriage of [[Agnes of Hohenstaufen]], daughter of his cousin Count Palatine [[Conrad, Count Palatine of the Rhine|Conrad]], to Henry the Lion's son Henry of Brunswick, followed by a peace agreement in March 1194.\n\n===Conquest of Sicily===\n[[File:Jind\u0159ich VI. obl\u00e9h\u00e1 Neapol (1191).jpg|thumb|left|Siege of Naples, [[Peter of Eboli]], ''[[Liber ad honorem Augusti]]'', 1196]]\n[[File:Woodcut illustration of Constance of Sicily, her husband HRE Henry VI and her son HRE Frederick II - Penn Provenance Project.jpg|thumb|Woodcut, depicting [[Constance of Sicily]], husband Henry VI and son [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]]]\nMeanwhile, the situation in Southern Italy had grown worse: After Henry's defeat at Naples, Tancred's brother-in-law Count [[Richard, Count of Acerra|Richard of Acerra]] had reconquered large parts of Apulia, and Tancred himself had reached the allowance of his claims by the pope. Henry was granted free passage in Northern Italy, having forged an alliance with the Lombard communes. In February 1194, Tancred of Lecce died, leaving as heir a young boy, [[William III of Sicily|William III]], under the tutelage of his mother [[Sibylla of Acerra]]. In May Emperor Henry, based on King Richard's ransom, again set out for Italy. He reached Milan at Pentecost and occupied Naples in August. He met little resistance and on 20 November 1194 entered [[Palermo]] capital of Kingdom of Sicily and was crowned king on 25 December. On the next day his wife Constance, who had stayed back in [[Iesi]], gave birth to his only son and heir [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the future emperor and king of Sicily and Jerusalem.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\nThe young William and his mother Sibylla had fled to [[Caltabellotta]] Castle; he officially renounced the Sicilian kingdom in turn for the [[County of Lecce]] and the [[Principality of Capua]]. A few days after Henry's coronation, however, the royal family and several Norman nobles were accused of a coup attempt and arrested. Henry is said to have had William blinded and castrated, while many of his liensmen{{cfn|date=November 2019}} were [[death by burning|burned alive]]. Some, however, like the Siculo-Greek [[Eugene of Palermo]], transitioned into the new Hohenstaufen government with ease. William probably was deported to [[Hohenems|Altems]] (Hohenems) Castle in Swabia, where he died in captivity about 1198. To take revenge of the capture of his wife Henry hanged [[Richard, Count of Acerra]] brother of Sibylla in 1196.\n\nIn March 1195 Henry held a ''Hoftag'' in [[Bari]] and appointed his wife Constance Sicilian [[queen regnant]], though with Henry's liensman{{cfn|date=November 2019}} [[Conrad I, Duke of Spoleto|Conrad of Urslingen]], elevated to a hereditary [[Duchy of Spoleto|Duke of Spoleto]], as [[Imperial vicar]] to secure the emperor's position in Southern Italy. He placed further ''[[ministerialis|ministeriales]]'' in the Sicilian administration, like the [[Troia, Apulia|Troia]] bishop [[Walter of Palearia]] who became chancellor. His loyal henchman Markward von Annweiler was appointed a Duke of [[Ravenna]], placing him in a highly strategic position to control the route to Sicily via the Italian [[Romagna]] region and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. Henry's younger brother [[Philip of Swabia]] was vested with the large estates of late Margravine [[Matilda of Tuscany|Matilda]] in [[March of Tuscany|Tuscany]]. The emperor also felt strong enough to send home the Pisan and Genoese ships without giving their governments the promised concessions.<ref name=\"Matthew1992\">{{cite book|author=Donald Matthew|title=The Norman Kingdom of Sicily - p. 290|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CQfub3l_ejkC|date=30 July 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-26911-7}}</ref>\n\n===Universal ruler===\n[[File:Codex Manesse Heinrich VI. (HRR).jpg|thumb|Portrait from the ''[[Codex Manesse]]'', {{circa}} 1304]]\nAt that point, Emperor Henry was the most powerful monarch in the Mediterranean and Europe, since the Sicilian kingdom added to his personal and Imperial revenues an income without parallel in Europe. However, his aims to integrate Sicily into the Empire as a second power base of the Hohenstaufen dynasty were not realised during his lifetime. The negotiations with Pope Celestine III to approve the unification (''unio regni ad imperium'') in return of another [[Crusade of 1197|crusade]] reached a deadlock. On the other hand, his beliefs of a universal rule according to the ''[[translatio imperii]]'' concept collided with the existence of the [[Byzantine Empire]], reflected in Henry's expansionist policies by forging alliances with King [[Leo I, King of Armenia|Leo I of Armenia]] and King [[Amalric II of Jerusalem|Aimery of Cyprus]].\n\nIn 1195 Henry's envoys in [[Constantinople]] raised claims to former [[Italo-Norman]] possessions around [[Durr\u00ebs|Dyrrachium]] (Durr\u00ebs), one of the most important naval bases on the eastern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, and pressed for a contribution to the planned crusade. Upon the deposition of Emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]] Henry openly threatened with an attack on Byzantine territory. He already evolved plans to betroth his younger brother Philip to Isaac's daughter Princess [[Irene Angelina]] \u2014deliberately or not\u2014 opening up a perspective to unite the Western and Eastern Empire under Hohenstaufen rule. According to the contemporary historian [[Niketas Choniates]] his legates were able to collect [[Alamanikon|a large tribute]] from Isaac's brother and successor [[Alexios III Angelos|Alexios III]], which, however, was not paid before Henry's death.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fulcrum.org/concern/monographs/6w924c14h |title=Byzantium confronts the West, 1180-1204 |publisher=  History Scotland  |author=Charles M.

''La Serenissima'' had suspiciously eyed Henry's claims to Adriatic ports threatening her dominating position and commercial interests in the region. The emperor had to culminate the conflict by arranging a peace treaty and confirming the Venetian autonomy.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://rc.library.uta.edu/uta-ir/bitstream/handle/10106/1777/Brubaker_uta_2502M_10368.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |title= BYZANTINE DIPLOMACY AND THE DECLINE IN RELATIONS WITH THE WEST  FROM 962 TO 1204 |publisher=  University of Texas  |author=Jeff Brubaker |date=  |accessdate=February 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n===Hereditary monarchy===\n{{main|Erbreichsplan}}\nIn summer 1195 Henry returned to Germany, in order to call for support to launch his crusade and to arrange his succession in the case of his death. However, he first again had to deal with the quarrels in the Wettin Margraviate of Meissen upon the death of Margrave Albert I. As Albert had tried to gain control over the adjacent [[Pleissnerland]], an Imperial Hohenstaufen territory, Henry took the occasion to deny the inheritance claims of the margrave's younger brother Theodoric and seized the Meissen territory for himself. In October he reconciled with Archbishop Hartwig of Bremen at [[Gelnhausen]] and was able to obtain the support of numerous Saxon and Thuringian nobles for his crusade which was scheduled to begin on Christmas 1196.\n\nHis next aim was to make the imperial crown [[Erbreichsplan|hereditary]]. Henry tried to secure the Imperial election of his son Frederick II as King of the Romans, which however met with objections raised by Archbishop [[Adolf of Altena|Adolf of Cologne]]. Spending the winter in [[Hagenau]] Castle, the emperor and his ''ministeriales'' evolved the idea of a hereditary monarchy. Though they would have lost their right to elect the kings, the secular princes themselves wished to make their Imperial fiefs hereditary and to be inheritable by the female line as well, and Henry agreed to consider these demands. The emperor also bought the support of ecclesiastical princes by announcing that he would be willing to give up the ''[[Jus Spolii]]'' and the right to receive recurring earnings from church lands during a period of ''[[sede vacante]]''. At the Diet of [[W\u00fcrzburg]], held in March/April 1196, he managed to convince the majority of the princes to vote for his proposal. However, Archbishop Adolf of Cologne did not even put in an appearance and several princes, predominantly in Saxony and Thuringia, were still dissatisfied.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://file.upi.edu/Direktori/FPBS/JUR._PEND._BAHASA_JERMAN/196111101985031-AMIR/Bahan_Ajar_dan_Silabus_Deutsche_Geschichte_2010/Sailer_und_Staufer.pdf |title= Hochmittelalter |publisher=  UPI |author=Alfred Haverkamp |date=  |accessdate=February 28, 2020 }}</ref>\n\nWhile in July 1196 Henry proceeded to Burgundy and Italy in order to negotiate with Pope Celestine III, the resistance in Germany grew. At the following diet at [[Erfurt]] in October, a majority of the princes rejected the emperor's plans. Furthermore, the Pope, still concerned in view of the Hohenstaufen rule over Sicily, broke off the talks. Nevertheless, on Christmas Henry's son Frederick II was elected King of the Romans in Frankfurt.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:DSC00548 - Cattedrale - Tomba di Enrico VI + 1197 - Foto G. Dall'Orto.jpg|thumb|Henry's grave in the Cathedral of Palermo]]\n\nAt the same time, the emperor stayed in [[Capua]], where he had Count Richard of Acerra, held in custody by his ''ministerialis'' [[Dipold, Count of Acerra|Dipold von Schweinspeunt]], cruelly executed. He entered Sicily in March 1197 and applied himself to prepare his crusade in [[Messina]].\n\nSoon after, the tyrannical power of the foreign King in Italy spurred a revolt, especially around [[Catania]] and southern Sicily, which his German soldiers led by Markward of Annweiler and [[Henry of Kalden]] suppressed mercilessly. The rebels even sought to make Count [[Jordan Lupinus|Jordan of Bovino]] king in Henry's place. Even Queen Constance, provoked by the neglect of Henry and pitying her countrymen, joined the revolts against him and besieged him in a castle, forcing him into a treaty.<ref>[[Evelyn Jamison]], ''Admiral Eugenius of Sicily, His Life and Work and the Authorship of the ''Epistola ad Petrum'' and the ''Historia Hugonis Falcandi Siculi (London: 1957), pp. 158\u201359.</ref> In the midst of preparations Henry fell ill with [[chills]] while hunting near [[Fiumedinisi]] and on 28 September died, possibly of [[malaria]], in Messina,<ref>In 1197, although \"the well-prepared crusade of Emperor Henry VI aimed at winning the Holy Land, it also aimed at attaining the ancient goal of Norm[an] policy in the E[ast]: the conquest of the Byz[antine] Empire.\"  See Werner Hilgemann and Hermann Kinder, ''The Anchor Atlas of World History, Volume I: From the Stone Age to the Eve of the French Revolution'', trans.

However, a number of princes around Archbishop Adolf of Cologne elected the Welf [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], son of Henry the Lion, anti-king. To defend the claims of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, Frederick's uncle Philip of Swabia had himself elected King of the Romans in March 1198. The [[German throne dispute|German throne quarrel]] lasted nearly twenty years, until Frederick was again elected king in 1212 and Otto, defeated by the [[kingdom of France|French]] in the 1214 [[Battle of Bouvines]] and abandoned by his former allies, finally died in 1218.<ref name=\"Fuhrmann1986\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:PfalzKaiserswert08.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Ruins of the ''Kaiserpfalz'' in [[D\u00fcsseldorf-Kaiserswerth]], western front (\"interior\" view)]]\nDuring his rule in Germany, Henry moved from one ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'' residence to another or\u2013to a lesser extent\u2013stayed at [[Prince-bishop]]'s sees in the tradititon of the medieval itinerant kingship. He concentrated on the [[Duchy of Franconia|Franconian]] core locations of his kingdom, while the [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavarian]] and [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxon]] lands were less subject to the central authority. His travel routes through Germany as well as his campaigns in Italy are documented by numerous deeds he issued year by year.\n\nThe emperor strongly relied on high-ranking clergy like the archbishops [[Philip I (archbishop of Cologne)|Philip of Cologne]] and [[Conrad of Wittelsbach|Conrad of Mainz]]. Several contemporary accounts of his life given by ecclesiastical chroniclers like [[Godfrey of Viterbo]] or [[Peter of Eboli]] in his ''[[Liber ad honorem Augusti]]'' (on the emperor's conquest of Sicily) paint a bright picture of Henry's rule; while the annals by [[Otto of Sankt Blasien]] are considered more objective. In his ''[[Arnoldi Chronica Slavorum]]'' the chronicler [[Arnold of L\u00fcbeck]] concentrates on the dispute between the Hohenstaufen and Welf dynasties from a pronounced Welf perspective, while [[Gislebert of Mons]] tells of Henry's policies in [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[County of Flanders|Flanders]]. The Hohenstaufen rule in Italy and the Meezogiorno is documented by the chronicles of Archbishop [[Romuald Guarna|Romuald of Salerno]] and [[Richard of San Germano]]. Henry's conflict with King Richard I of England is rendered by [[Roger of Hoveden]] and [[Gervase of Tilbury]], expressing their negative attitudes towards the emperor.\n\nLater historians stressed the fact of Henry's early death and the succeeding throne quarrel as a stroke of fate and a major setback for the development of a German [[nation state]] begun under his father Frederick Barbarossa. On the other hand, the emperor's stern measures in Sicily earned him the reputation of a cruel and merciless ruler. Present-day historical research classifies Henry as a man of his time; though a capable ruler he had to cope with the centrifugal forces of the disintegrating empire while at the same time he overstretched the Hohenstaufen realm to an extent that finally could not be kept together.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

However, Jackson was injured himself in Week 15, giving rookie [[Joe Webb]] a chance to stake a claim for the position. He was unable to hold onto the position as [[Donovan McNabb]] was signed as a free agent to replace Favre, who retired at the end of the 2010 season. After going 1\u20135 through the first six games of 2011, though, McNabb was replaced by first-round draft pick [[Christian Ponder]], who retained the starting position for the remainder of the season and for the whole of 2012. However, he was plagued by indifferent form and the Vikings signed [[Matt Cassel]] \u2013 recently released by the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. When Ponder suffered an injury early in the 2013 season, Cassel was given his first start for the Vikings in week 4 in the [[NFL International Series]] game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], London. He started the following game, but was replaced in week 7 by [[Josh Freeman]], recently signed after his release by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. However, he was injured during the game and did not make another start for the Vikings, allowing Ponder to reclaim the starting role. Cassel then returned as the starter in week 14, and retained the role for the rest of the season and into 2014. After three games, he was placed on injured reserve and first-round draft pick [[Teddy Bridgewater]] took over for the week 4 game against the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. Bridgewater himself was injured late in the game, allowing Ponder the chance to come back in for the following week, but the rookie soon returned and has held the starting berth until suffering a knee injury in practice during the 2016 preseason. [[Shaun Hill]] started the season opener and [[Sam Bradford]] took over in week 2. Ahead of the [[2018 Minnesota Vikings season|2018 season]], the Vikings signed free agent quarterback [[Kirk Cousins]] from the [[Washington Redskins]] on a three-year, fully guaranteed $84&nbsp;million contract.

As of the [[2019 Minnesota Vikings season|2019 season]], Minnesota's starting quarterback is [[Kirk Cousins]].\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2017}}\nThe Vikings' starting quarterback for the first game of their [[1961 Minnesota Vikings season|inaugural season]] against the [[Chicago Bears]] was [[George Shaw (American football)|George Shaw]].<ref name=\"Shaw\"/> However, he was replaced by [[Fran Tarkenton]] early on, who passed for four touchdowns in the game and rushed for one more. Tarkenton went on to start in 10 of the Vikings' 14 regular season matches that year.<ref name=\"1961 Vikings\"/> He played for the Vikings until 1967, when he was traded to the [[New York Giants]],<ref name=\"Tarkenton\"/> and [[Joe Kapp]] took his place as the Vikings' starting quarterback .<ref name=\"Kapp\"/> Kapp led the Vikings to their first playoff appearance in 1968,<ref name=\"1968 Vikings\"/> but he was traded to the [[Boston Patriots]] in 1970 and [[Gary Cuozzo]] stepped up to replace him.<ref name=\"Kapp\"/><ref name=\"Cuozzo\"/> Cuozzo remained in the position for two seasons, moving to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in 1972.<ref name=\"Cuozzo\"/>\n\nTarkenton returned for another seven-year spell as the Vikings' starting quarterback in 1972, continuing until his retirement in 1978,<ref name=\"Tarkenton\"/> at which point [[Tommy Kramer]] was promoted from the second string in his second season with the franchise.<ref name=\"Kramer\"/> Kramer was injured for most of the 1983 season, so [[Steve Dils]] served as the starting quarterback for most of the season,<ref name=\"Dils\"/> before Kramer reclaimed the position in 1984.<ref name=\"Kramer\"/> For the 1987 season, Kramer shared quarterback duties with [[Wade Wilson (American football)|Wade Wilson]], before Wilson took over on a permanent basis from 1988.<ref name=\"Wilson\"/> Wilson was replaced by the emerging [[Rich Gannon]] in 1990,<ref name=\"Gannon\"/> but Gannon was released after the 1992 season and veteran [[Jim McMahon]] took over for the 1993 season until the arrival of [[Warren Moon]] in 1994.<ref name=\"McMahon\"/>\n\nMoon retained the starting quarterback spot for two seasons,<ref name=\"Moon\"/> but suffered a broken collarbone halfway through his third season with the Vikings and was replaced by [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] for the remainder of the season.<ref name=\"Johnson\"/> The Vikings had three starting quarterbacks in the following three seasons&nbsp;\u2013 Johnson (1997),<ref name=\"Johnson\"/> [[Randall Cunningham]] (1998)<ref name=\"Cunningham\"/> and [[Jeff George]] (1999)<ref name=\"George\"/>&nbsp;\u2013 before [[Daunte Culpepper]] began a six-year spell in his second year in the NFL in 2000.<ref name=\"Culpepper\"/> He suffered a serious knee injury during the 2005 season, and Johnson took over in the position again, having re-signed the previous summer after seven years away from the franchise.<ref name=\"Johnson\"/> Culpepper then joined the [[Miami Dolphins]] in 2006,<ref name=\"Culpepper\"/> giving Johnson another full year as starting quarterback,<ref name=\"Johnson\"/> only to be replaced by sophomore [[Tarvaris Jackson]] in 2007.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> The 2008 season commenced with Jackson starting at quarterback,<ref name=\"Jackson\"/> but he was replaced after two games by [[Gus Frerotte]], who was returning to the Vikings from the [[St. Louis Rams]] after having been traded to the Miami Dolphins in 2005.<ref name=\"Frerotte\"/> Jackson regained the job for the final three games and led the Vikings to their first divisional title since 2000, and their first NFC North title.<ref name=\"Jackson\"/>\n\nIn 2009, the Vikings recruited veteran quarterback [[Brett Favre]] out of retirement to be their new starting quarterback.<ref name=\"Favre\"/> In Week 13 of the 2010 season, Favre suffered a chest injury that ended his NFL-record streak of consecutive starts at 297 (321 including postseason games), and Tarvaris Jackson reclaimed the starting spot for Week 14. However, Jackson was injured himself in Week 15, giving rookie [[Joe Webb]] a chance to stake a claim for the position. He was unable to hold onto the position as [[Donovan McNabb]] was signed as a free agent to replace Favre, who retired at the end of the 2010 season. After going 1\u20135 through the first six games of 2011, though, McNabb was replaced by first-round draft pick [[Christian Ponder]], who retained the starting position for the remainder of the season and for the whole of 2012. However, he was plagued by indifferent form and the Vikings signed [[Matt Cassel]] \u2013 recently released by the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. When Ponder suffered an injury early in the 2013 season, Cassel was given his first start for the Vikings in week 4 in the [[NFL International Series]] game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[Wembley Stadium]], London. He started the following game, but was replaced in week 7 by [[Josh Freeman]], recently signed after his release by the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. However, he was injured during the game and did not make another start for the Vikings, allowing Ponder to reclaim the starting role. Cassel then returned as the starter in week 14, and retained the role for the rest of the season and into 2014. After three games, he was placed on injured reserve and first-round draft pick [[Teddy Bridgewater]] took over for the week 4 game against the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. Bridgewater himself was injured late in the game, allowing Ponder the chance to come back in for the following week, but the rookie soon returned and has held the starting berth until suffering a knee injury in practice during the 2016 preseason. [[Shaun Hill]] started the season opener and [[Sam Bradford]] took over in week 2. Ahead of the [[2018 Minnesota Vikings season|2018 season]], the Vikings signed free agent quarterback [[Kirk Cousins]] from the [[Washington Redskins]] on a three-year, fully guaranteed $84&nbsp;million contract. He started 31 consecutive regular season games to start his Vikings career before sitting out the final game of [[2019 Minnesota Vikings season|2019]] with the team's playoff berth already secured; [[Sean Mannion (American football)|Sean Mannion]] started in his place.\n\nSeven Vikings quarterbacks have made at least one start in their rookie season: Tarkenton in 1961, Vander Kelen in 1963, Kramer in 1977, Jackson in 2006, Webb in 2010, Ponder in 2011 and Bridgewater in 2014.\n\n==Starting quarterbacks by season==\n[[File:Halo3LaunchInSeattle WarrenMoon.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Warren Moon]] was the [[Minnesota Vikings]]' starting quarterback from 1994 to 1996.|alt=Head and shoulders of a bald black man wearing a light shirt and a black suit jacket.]]\n[[File:Daunte Culpepper cropped.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Daunte Culpepper]] was the Vikings' starting quarterback for six seasons from [[2000 Minnesota Vikings season|2000]] to [[2005 Minnesota Vikings season|2005]].|alt=A smiling black man with very short, dark hair, wearing a white sleeveless shirt.]]\n[[File:Mcmahon.1993.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jim McMahon]] was the Vikings' starting quarterback for the [[1993 Minnesota Vikings season|1993 season]].|alt=A white man wearing a purple jersey with white trim and a large numeral \"9\" in white on his chest.

{"title_page": "List of New Zealand Test cricket victories", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\nThis is a list of the [[New Zealand national cricket team]]'s [[Test cricket|Test match]] victories. The New Zealand cricket team played its first Test in January 1930 against England in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand. The team won their first Test match 45 matches and 26 years later, against the West Indies at [[Eden Park]], Auckland, in the 1955/56 season. As of 19 March 2020, NZ has played 442 Test matches, '''won 101''', lost 175, while 166 matches ended as a draw.\n\n==1930 to 1945==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Played 14\n| '''WON 0'''\n| Lost 5\n| Drew 9\n|-\n|}\n\nThe [[New Zealand cricket team]]'s inaugural Test match was played on 10\u201312 January 1930 against England in Christchurch. The team contained two of NZ's finest ever batsmen, [[Stewie Dempster]] and [[Roger Blunt]] but the match was lost.\n\n==1945/46 to 1955==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Played 19\n| '''WON 0'''\n| Lost 10\n| Drew 9\n|-\n|}\n\nIn 1949 NZ sent one of its best ever sides to England. It contained [[Bert Sutcliffe]], [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]], [[John Richard Reid|John Reid]] and [[Jack Cowie]].

Neither their form in the preceding season, when they were bowled out for the world record low Test score of 26 by England, nor their form in the three matches prior to this one suggested NZ's first Test victory was near at hand. The West Indies thrashed NZ in the first three matches of the four-match series by an innings and 71 runs, an innings and 64 runs, and 9 wickets respectively.\n\nIn the end, the victory over the West Indies was as comprehensive as the three previous losses had been. NZ outplayed the West Indies from start to finish. [[John Richard Reid|John Reid]], one of NZ's greatest cricketers, top scored for the match with 84 in the NZ first innings.

Australia ignored NZ for 28 years after that claiming that NZ were not good enough to play them. NZ lost a 3 match series in Australia, 3\u20130 in 1973/74 but later in the same summer drew a 3-match series in NZ 1\u20131.\n \nIt was in the second match of this series that NZ achieved its maiden Test win over Australia. [[Glenn Turner]] (101 and 110*) became the first New Zealander to get a century in each innings of a Test. Turner scored nearly half of NZ's runs in the match while no other NZ batsmen got over 50. Turner also held the second innings together as NZ threatened to collapse chasing 228 for victory. [[Richard Collinge]] and the Hadlee brothers, [[Richard Hadlee|Richard]] and [[Dayle Hadlee|Dayle]] dismissed Australia for 223 and 259 and gave NZ the chance to chase what appeared to be smallish total for victory. In the end though it required another heroic performance from Turner to secure the win. Australia won the third match to draw the series.\n\n==1975/76 to 1985==\n\nThere were two main reasons for NZ's improved test record in this decade. The first was that Sri Lanka were newly granted test status at this time \u2013 NZ picked up 4 victories in Sri Lanka's first few years in test cricket, when they were a relatively weak and inexperienced side. The second reason was that NZ had the services of its best ever bowler, [[Richard Hadlee]] who made his debut in 1973.

India won the toss and chose to bat against NZ's four pronged pace attack. The pitch was easy paced and the Indian openers started well but soon after mid-day [[Richard Hadlee]] dismissed the top 3 in 15 balls. His brother Dayle got another. The middle order recovered somewhat and India posted 220 with [[Richard Hadlee]] taking 4\u201335.\n\nCaptain [[Glenn Turner]] 64, [[Bevan Congdon]] 52, got NZ off to a good start and [[Mark Burgess (cricketer)|Mark Burgess]] 95, [[Lance Cairns]] 47 and the tail gave NZ a 114 first innings run lead. India's opener [[Sunil Gavaskar]] was hit in the cheek while fielding, ended up in hospital and took no further part in the game.\n\nOn the fourth day the Indians struggled against the NZ bowlers especially [[Richard Hadlee]] who bowled with pace and accuracy and went to lunch at 62 for 3. After lunch [[Richard Hadlee]] was irresistible and in 28 balls took 5\u201310 to finish with 7 for 23. His match figures of 11\u201358 was a new record for NZ and only the second time a NZ bowler had taken 10 wickets in a match. [[Jack Cowie]] took 10\u2013140 v England in 1937.\n\nThe 3 match series was drawn 1 all.\n\n[[Glenn Turner]] played in 7 more tests after this one before disputes with the NZ Cricket board kept him out of test cricket for 6 years.

When England were set only 137 to win it seemed highly likely that England's unbeaten run would continue. However, when [[Richard Collinge]] bowled [[Geoff Boycott|Boycott]] with a fast inswinger the NZ players sensed an upset. [[Richard Hadlee]] and Collinge bowling virtually unchanged, poured on the pressure and dismissed the English for 64. Collinge (3 for 35) knocked the top off the order and Hadlee (6 for 26) cleaned up the middle and the tail. Hadlee's match figures were 10 for 100 and Collinge's were 6 for 77. The crowd, realising the historical importance of this victory, cheered the fall of each wicket with the same enthusiasm as those present at NZ's first test victory over 20 years beforehand.\n\nIn NZ's first innings [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]] took nearly 6 hours to make 55 on his test debut. In a low scoring game his score was only bettered by Boycott who took 7 and a half hours to make 77. The English won the second test and the 3-match series was drawn 1\u20131.\n\n===11 v West Indies at Dunedin 1979/80 ''NZ won by 1 wicket''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eap.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1970S/1979-80/WI_IN_NZ/WI_NZ_T1_08-13FEB1980.html|title=1st Test: New Zealand v West Indies at Dunedin, Feb 8\u201313, 1980 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nIn one of the most acrimonious series of all time NZ achieved their first series win against the West Indies. The West Indies had recently beaten Australia 2\u20130 in a hard tour and arrived in NZ expecting to thrash the locals. As the West Indies had a side full of great players most of the NZ public expected much the same. Unfortunately for the West Indies they ran into [[Richard Hadlee]], some questionable umpiring and their own petulance, finally leaving NZ with a series loss and their reputations as sportsmen in tatters.\n\nIn the West Indies first innings of 140, Hadlee took 5 for 34 with 4 lbws. Although the pitch was keeping low, Don Cameron, a NZ cricket journalist, described the umpiring as \"indifferent\". NZ replied with 249, [[Bruce Edgar]] got 65 and Hadlee a quick 51. When umpire John Hastie gave [[John Parker (cricketer, born 1951)|John Parker]] not out [[Michael Holding]] kicked down the stumps. Parker later went on to score zero. The resulting photo is one of the most famous cricketing photos<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/241985.html|title=Ding-dong in Dunedin|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> The West Indies scored 212 in their second bat and Hadlee got 6 for 68 with 3 more lbws. At the time, 12 lbws in the test were a new record. This was the first instance of a NZ player scoring 50 and taking 10 wickets in the same test. NZ needed only 104 to win but lost nine wickets getting to 100. The winning run was a leg bye.\n\nThe second and third tests were drawn but marred by more poor umpiring and some shocking behaviour from the West Indies. Among the lowlights from the second test were:\n*The West Indies refused to take the field after tea on the third day. Play finally resumed 12 minutes late.\n*The West Indies players spent the final session of the third day accidentally-on-purpose conceding boundaries and dropping catches.\n*After play ended on the third day the West Indies players voted to go home and held a party at their hotel to celebrate. The West Indies board ordered the players to stay.\n*On the fourth day [[Colin Croft]] deliberately shoulder barged umpire [[Fred Goodall]].\n*[[Clive Lloyd]] standing unmoved at second slip, forcing the umpires to come to him to talk about Croft's behaviour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/237606.html|title=Shoulder barges and flying stumps|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/newzealand/content/story/129232.html|title=What's going on?

Despite movement for the bowlers, NZ finished the first day at 241 for 4. A patient unbeaten 137 over nearly six hours by captain [[Geoff Howarth]] got NZ to 375. Howarth's innings was the decisive factor in the match, the rest of which was dominated by the bowlers.\n\n[[Lance Cairns]] swung the ball late, and made deep inroads into the Indian batting by the end of the second day. The next day [[Gary Troup]] helped Cairns press home the advantage. Cairns took 5 for 33 and Troup 3 for 43.

An aggressive Howarth (56) helped him add 87 for the third wicket and [[Jeremy Coney]] (73) 154 for the fourth wicket. Edgar was seventh out and runs from the tail gave NZ a 177 run first innings lead. Nineteen-year-old [[Martin Crowe]], playing in his second test match, scored 2.\n\nWith nothing in the pitch for the faster bowlers, Australia reached 167 before losing their second wicket and at the end of the fourth day Australia were 64 ahead on 241\u20134.

Lees added 42 for the 9th wicket with [[Martin Snedden]] 52 for the 10th wicket with [[Ewen Chatfield]] NZ finally posted 344.\n\n[[Lance Cairns]] (4\u201349) and [[Richard Hadlee]] (4\u201333) were too good for Sri Lanka and they were dismissed for 144, failing by only 1 run to save the follow-on. Their second innings was hardly happier, all out for 175. [[Martin Snedden]] took 3\u201348 [[Lance Cairns]] 4\u201347 and [[Ewen Chatfield]] 3\u201340.\n\nThis was New Zealand's first test victory inside three days and only the second time they had won by an innings. [[Glenn Turner]] played 39 test matches for New Zealand between February 1969 and February 1977. A falling out with the NZ cricket authorities lead to Turner not playing for New Zealand for six years. He played two more test matches against Sri Lanka in March 1983, both of which NZ won.\n\n===15 v Sri Lanka at Wellington 1982/83 ''NZ won by 6 wickets''===\n\nThe second test of the inaugural series between Sri Lanka and New Zealand was marred by rain. Although play took place on each of the five days, the match itself lasted little more than eighteen hours. Sent in to bat on a seam-friendly pitch, Sri Lanka slumped to 48/4 by the second morning but were revived by a great stand of 130 for the fifth wicket between [[Ranjan Madugalle]] and [[Somachandra de Silva]] and eventually reached 240, with [[Ewen Chatfield]] taking 4 for 66. New Zealand also struggled in their first innings and looked to be flagging at 169/9, but Sri Lanka's lacklustre fielding allowed New Zealand to pass the 200 mark. Hadlee, who was dropped on 0, struck a quickfire 30 and Cairns, who was also missed before scoring, made a brisk 45 and added 32 for the last wicket with Chatfield, reducing New Zealand's first innings deficit to 39. [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]] had his nose broken by a bouncer but returned to add an additional four runs, taking his total run aggregate past 1000. Sri Lanka then collapsed to 93 in their second innings with wicketkeeper [[Warren Lees]] taking five catches. New Zealand knocked off the 133 runs they needed with 6 wickets to spare, reaching the target 48 minutes before lunch with a six from Hadlee.\n\n===16 v England at Leeds 1983 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\nNew Zealand finally won a Test in England after 17 defeats and 11 draws, overcoming a hostile spell from Bob Willis to secure a five-wicket triumph on the fourth day. It also ended a 16-year drought for an overseas victory and, amazingly, didn't include a wicket from Richard Hadlee, although he deserved much better. Lance Cairns was the hero with ten wickets in the match and seven in the first innings in helpful conditions. England were well placed on 175 for 3 before they lost 7 for 50. John Wright (93) and Bruce Edgar (84) then played key roles in engineering a 152-run win. Edgar had to retire hurt after being hit on the thigh by Ian Botham, but returned to add 84 with Hadlee, who scored a vital 75. Ewen Chatfield bagged five in the second innings. Only David Gower's 112 provided much resistance. The target caused a few wobbles, but Jeremy Coney held his nerve. He later said: \"The main feeling was thinking of all the New Zealand players who have been coming here for 52 years, better players than myself, and making sure that their sweat and effort had not been in vain.\" England hit back to take the final two Tests and claim the four-match series 3\u20131.<ref name=\"content-nz.cricinfo.com\">{{cite web|url=http://content-nz.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/current/story/351022.html|title=Overjoyed overseas|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===17 v England at Christchurch 1983/84 ''NZ won by an innings and 132 runs''===\n\nThe second match of the series saw New Zealand outplay their opponents in just about every facet of the game. A shambolic performance from England, including a bowling effort later described by [[Bob Willis]] as some of the worst bowling he had ever seen in Test cricket, allowed NZ to achieve their largest victory at the time in little over twelve hours of play.\n\nAided by some wayward bowling, NZ posted 307 in their first innings, at what was then considered a fairly brisk rate of 4.2 runs per over. Richard Hadlee, coming in with the innings in the balance, struck 99 off 81 balls, taking full toll of a surplus of long hops and half volleys from the tiring England bowlers. Taking advantage of a suspect surface, the NZ bowlers proceeded to run through the England batting lineup on the rain-affected second day. England were promptly dismissed for 83 in their first innings, with Hadlee, Cairns and Chatfield taking 3 wickets apiece. After being forced to follow on, England were reduced to 33/6 and some wondered if they would be able to surpass their lowest score against NZ in a Test (64). Although they managed to, thanks to a 39-run partnership between Derek Randall and Bob Taylor, England were eventually dismissed for 93, handing NZ victory by an innings and 132 runs. Hadlee's bowling figures of 8/44 for the match, along with his 99 in the first innings, made him the dominant figure of the match.<ref>{{cite web|title=NEW ZEALAND v ENGLAND 1983\u201384|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152309.html|website=Cricinfo|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===18 v Sri Lanka at Kandy 1983/84 ''NZ won by 165 runs''===\n\n===19 v Sri Lanka at Colombo 1983/84 ''NZ won by an innings and 61 runs''===\n\n===20 v Pakistan at Auckland 1984/85 ''NZ won by an innings and 99 runs''===\n\n===21 v Pakistan at Dunedin 1984/85 ''NZ won by 2 wickets''===\nThis was New Zealand's last series victory over Pakistan until November 2016.\n\n==1985/86 to 1995==\n[[Richard Hadlee]] played in all of the first 8 test victories of this decade, taking 73 wickets at an average of 13.53.

Of Hadlee's 86 Tests, New Zealand won 22 and lost 28. Hadlee missed 14 tests during his career and NZ didn't win a single one. By December 2007, of the 17 tests that Bond had played in, NZ had won 9 and lost only 2.

Hadlee's targeting of [[Andrew Hilditch]]'s weakness (he was a compulsive hooker) was particularly brilliant. Hilditch was caught off Hadlee's bowling at fine leg in both innings and never played for Australia again, although he did become an Australian selector.\n\nHadlee's haul was so extraordinary that it tends to over-shadow NZ excellent performance with the bat \u2013 NZ recorded their highest score against Australia. [[Martin Crowe]] (188), [[John Fulton Reid|John F. Reid]] (108) and Hadlee (54*) were the main contributors in NZ's 553/7 dec. Crowe and Reid's 3rd wicket partnership of 224 was at the time a new record for NZ.\n\nAustralia won the second test in Sydney but NZ won the third in Perth to take the series. Peter English said in 2007 that the series was all about Hadlee. \"He may not bowl at the same speed as the West Indian pace battery, but he is a master at his craft.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/columns/content/current/story/324188.html|title=International man of mastery rocks the Gabba|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===23 v Australia at Perth 1985/86 ''NZ won by 6 wickets''===\n\nAnother match, another Hadlee masterclass. He picked up 11 wickets at the WACA to give New Zealand their first series win against Australia. He also finished the series with a remarkable 33 victims at 12.15, the best figures in a three-match Test tour since SF Barnes in 1912. New Zealand entered the match with the series at 1\u20131 \u2013 they were unfortunate to have lost the second Test, at the SCG, which could have gone either way. But their medium-fast seamers, who had laboured on hard and fast Australian pitches in the past, found themselves in 1985\u201386 bowling on surfaces more like those in their own country. It also meant sensible, straight-playing batsman could thrive. It was the perfect combination for New Zealand. Even the renovated WACA ground was not its usual lightning self, though the batsmen were not entirely comfortable, and when New Zealand were set 164 to win at roughly two an over, on a pitch that was breaking up, they were no certainty. But Crowe's unbeaten 42 got them there with six wickets and ten overs to spare.<ref name=\"content-nz.cricinfo.com\"/>\n\n===24 v Australia at Auckland 1985/86 ''NZ won by 8 wickets''===\n\n[[John Bracewell]] took 10 wickets in this match and helped them bowl Australia out for 103 in their second innings.\n\n===25 v England at Nottingham 1986 ''NZ won by 8 wickets''===\n\n===26 v West Indies at Christchurch 1986/87 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\n===27 v India at Bombay 1988/89 ''NZ won 136 runs''===\n\nHadlee claimed the world wicket-taking record in the first Test but New Zealand predictably lost.

However, John Bracewell scraped together a battling 52 \u2013 his first crucial role in a match he would eventually win \u2013 to lift New Zealand to 236. Hadlee claimed 6 for 49 and as Wisden reported: \"[He] once again began to dictate terms: none of the remaining batsmen could keep him out as [Kris] Srikkanth had done at the start.\" India's last eight wickets went for 100 and they trailed by 2. Andrew Jones' 78 and Ian Smith's 54 set India 282 in 130 overs; they didn't get close. Srikkanth fell to Hadlee's first-ball incutter before Bracewell took over and removed Navjot Sidhu and Dilip Vengsarkar in his first two. There was no way back for India, who were never comfortable against Bracewell. \"Azharuddin's nervous start against Bracewell's old-fashioned, yet sharp, off-breaks told the whole tale of how India were being hoist with their own petard,\" Wisden said. \n<ref name=\"content-nz.cricinfo.com\"/>\n\n===28 v India at Christchurch 1989/90 ''NZ won by 10 wickets''===\n\nJohn Wright scored 185 in New Zealand's first innings of 459 while Sir Richard Hadlee took 400th test wicket on his home ground.\n\n===29 v Australia at Wellington 1989/90 ''NZ won by 9 wickets''===\n\n===30 v Zimbabwe at Harare 1992/93 ''NZ won by 177 runs''===\n\n===31 v Australia at Auckland 1992/93 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63603.html|title=3rd Test: New Zealand v Australia at Auckland, Mar 12\u201316, 1993 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nAustralia spent most of this engrossing Test trying to wriggle their way out of trouble after a calamitous opening day. Indeed, they almost wriggled into a winning position, setting New Zealand a thorny target of 201 on a bowlers' pitch. That the home side made the runs with five wickets to spare, and without succumbing to the tension of the occasion, was a measure of their improvement through the series.\n\nBorder's decision to bat looked reasonable after an uneventful first hour, but then the clouds enclosed Eden Park and the game underwent a personality change. New Zealand had learned the lessons of Christchurch and dismissed Australia for 139 in conditions conducive to swing and seam bowling. Morrison's lethal fast out-swingers brought him six for 37. This included his 100th Test wicket when he had Healy caught in the gully \u2013 though Border, his 99th, was given out caught behind to a delivery that clipped his off stump without removing the bails, the first of several decisions from umpire King that upset the Australians. Morrison became the eighth New Zealander to pass the milestone, in his 29th Test. New Zealand also benefited from the influence of the canny Watson; Martyn, who had replaced Mark Waugh, did well to get an edge to a Watson leg-cutter.\n\nThe impression that Eden Park was a swing bowler's paradise was reinforced next day by Steve Waugh, whose potent out-swinger had Crowe caught at first slip attempting to turn the ball to leg. Unfortunately, that resulted in Border holding back Warne \u2013 other than a maiden before lunch \u2013 until the last hour of the day, when New Zealand led by 39. Once again Warne changed a game's direction, taking four wickets for eight from 15 overs. Collectively the New Zealand batsmen had struck their best form of the series, but had little to show for it: the top five reached 20, but none passed Rutherford's 43, which ended when he danced recklessly down the pitch to Warne's second delivery.\n\nIn a bid to swing the delicately balanced series, Crowe tossed the new ball to his off-spinner, Patel. Crowe spoke later of the eerie feeling this created in the opposition, and certainly Australia appeared slightly spooked: Taylor was stumped in Patel's first over and Langer lbw in his second, neither offering a shot. Martyn responded with an aristocratic 74, dropping down on one knee to slap the bowling about. Boon made only 29 of their 107-run partnership before Martyn fell to Greatbatch's acrobatic catch at silly mid-off. But it still took determined contributions from Border and Hughes to scrape together the lead of 200 Australia thought they needed.\n\nThe series reached a climax with the heavyweight clash between Hughes and the New Zealand opener Greatbatch, who came out swinging like cowboys in a bar-room brawl. Hughes was affronted by Greatbatch's tactic of charging the bowling and the pair exchanged heated words, brushed chests and Hughes once spat on the ground in Greatbatch's direction. Greatbatch's most extraordinary shot came at the expense of McDermott, whom he charged and deposited into the terraces over wide mid-off. His 29 from 30 balls ended when Hughes uprooted his middle stump, but he had broken the ice. While never dominating Warne, the New Zealand batsmen made a better fist of his bowling than at any other stage in the series, and won in something close to comfort. This would be New Zealand's last test win over [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] for over 18 years.\n\n===32 v Pakistan at Christchurch 1993/94 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nz.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1993-94/PAK_IN_NZ/PAK_NZ_T3_24-28FEB1994.html|title=3rd Test: New Zealand v Pakistan at Christchurch, Feb 24\u201328, 1994 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nPakistan led by [[Saleem Malik]] and possessing two magnificent fast bowlers, [[Waqar Younis]] and [[Wasim Akram]], won the first two matches of the series and were widely expected to complete a clean sweep.\n\nAfter Pakistan's first innings of 344 ([[Danny Morrison (cricketer)|Danny Morrison]] 4\u2013105 & [[Simon Doull]] 3\u201393) Waqar Younis sliced through NZ's first innings in familiar fashion. Only [[Andrew Jones (cricketer, born 1959)|Andrew Jones]] (81) stood firm and NZ posted 200.  Thanks to some fine bowling [[Danny Morrison (cricketer)|Danny Morrison]] again (4\u201366) and [[Matthew Hart]] (3\u201347) Pakistan only got 179 in the third innings. Even so, NZ's target of 324 looked far too high. NZ had never scored more than 278 in the fourth innings for a test victory.\n\nAlthough they had more than 2 days to get them, at 133 for 4, with Jones gone, it did not look likely. But the 154-run stand between [[Bryan Young (cricketer)|Bryan Young]] (120) and [[Shane Thomson]] (120*) transformed the match and gave NZ an unlikely victory.\n\nIn late 1998, allegations were made at a Commission headed by Pakistan high court judge [[Malik Mohammad Qayyum]] into match fixing that some members of the Pakistan team had deliberately underperformed in matches on this tour. Salim Malik was subsequently banned from cricket for life (later overturned) and Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram were fined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2000/corruption_in_cricket/763483.stm|title=BBC SPORT  \u2013 Special Events \u2013 2000 \u2013 Corruption in Cricket  \u2013 The Malik affair: A timeline|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===33 v South Africa at Johannesburg 1994/95 ''NZ won by 137 runs''===\n\nNew Zealand marked their first tour of South Africa in 33 years with a victory that stunned the home side in Hansie Cronje's first Test as captain. It was a real team performance: Shane Thomson made 84, Crowe 83, Ken Rutherford 68, and there was a final wicket stand of 57, boosting them to above 400. Then Simon Doull took six wickets, and Matthew Hart five to wrap up the win. Dion Nash had South Africa in early trouble at 38 for 3, although Andrew Hudson's dismissal was shrouded in controversy: replays showed he'd walked for a catch that bounced. It needed Dave Richardson's 93 to avoid the follow-on but Fanie de Villiers brought South Africa back into the match as New Zealand fell to 34 for 5. Stubborn efforts from the lower order set South Africa a target of 327 on a wearing pitch. Hart's left-arm spin proved the trump card, helping to cover for the loss of Nash, who suffered a tour-ending side strain. The series, though, sank rapidly from these heights as New Zealand lost the final two Tests to become the first side since 1888 to lose a three-match series after going ahead. Three players \u2013 Hart, Nash and Stephen Fleming \u2013 were also suspended for smoking cannabis, and injuries hit the squad badly.<ref name=\"content-nz.cricinfo.com\"/>\n\n==1995/96 to 2005==\n\nThe reason for this was decade being NZ's most productive was the 8 victories recorded against weak opposition, namely Zimbabwe and newcomers Bangladesh. Zimbabwe was never a strong test side but they were severely weakened by the policies of their government. Bangladesh have won three tests since they were granted test status, one against Zimbabwe and two against the West Indies (their first overseas win and series victory), with both teams crippled by player strikes and inept administration. There were also 3 wins against the West Indies which had gone from the best side in the world to one of the weakest in little over a decade.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Played 85\n| '''WON 24'''\n| Lost 30\n| Drew 31\n|-\n|}\n\n===34 v Pakistan at Lahore 1996/97 ''NZ won by 44 runs''===\n\nThis was just New Zealand's second win in Pakistan and was inspired by an outstanding display of swing bowling from Doull. He claimed 8 for 85 in the match as New Zealand overcame an impressive debut century from Mohammad Wasim to secure a 44-run win on the fourth day. The opening stages of the match suggested anything but an away win, as Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed shared eight wickets to blow New Zealand apart for 155. But when their turn came, Pakistan slumped to 37 for 5 against Doull before hauling themselves to a seemingly vital 36-run lead. Chris Cairns turned the match as he came in at 101 for 5 and blasted 93 off 89 balls, while Fleming stood firm with an unbeaten 92. Chasing 276, Pakistan crashed to 60 for 6, and although Wasim resisted, he couldn't deny New Zealand. Cairns admitted it had been an emotional experience. \"I went up to Simon to congratulate him on an outstanding performance. I was quite close to tears.

NZ were in even deeper trouble in the second innings at 39 for 6 but then Carns smashed 80 off 93 balls and helped put on 123 for the last four wickets. England were set 246 for victory and were well placed at 123 for 2 but then lost 8 wickets for 39 with the last four adding 15.

Mervyn Dillon, Daren Powell, Pedro Collins and Adam Sanford were hardly of the Holding and Roberts mould. Wicket-keeper [[Robbie Hart]] (57 *) playing in only his second test added 108 with Fleming and 112 with the last 4 batsmen.\n\nMost of West Indies' batsmen were not in the Richards and Lloyd category either.

They were looking shaky at 113 for 5 but were rescued by Fleming (73), McCullum (111) and Vettori (127). McCullum got his second test century off 94 balls and Vettori scored NZ's fastest test century off 82 balls. [[Shane Bond]], batting at number 10, also got his highest test score, 41* from 38 balls.\n\nNZ declared overnight and bowled Zimbabwe out twice on day two, only the second time this has happened in the history of test cricket, (England bowled India out for 58 and 82 at Manchester in 1952). New Zealand bowled Zimbabwe out for 59 and 99. When scores are as low as these it is common for all the bowlers to get wickets and Vettori's 4 for 28 in the second innings were the best bowling figures in the game.\n\nOn 18 January 2006 Zimbabwe Cricket announced that it was suspending its participation in test matches because its players were not up to test standard.

Zimbabwe couldn't improve on their first innings score and lost by an innings again but took the game into the third day.\n\nCalls to suspend Zimbabwe from test cricket were renewed by those who believed Zimbabwe were devaluing the game and by those who wanted to punish Mugabe's regime. The NZ government had encouraged NZ cricket to call off this tour but NZ cricket refused, citing contractual obligations.\n\nThe game itself ended in farce.{{According to whom|date=April 2016}} Chris Mpofu was run out by [[Brendon McCullum]] when he left his crease to congratulate his partner on his half century before the ball was dead. As the incident happened at the end of a no contest and in a far-away country, no aspersions were cast on McCullum's or the Black Caps' lack of sportsmanship.

In fact, only an astounding piece of luck, some atrocious batting from the West Indies and some great bowling from [[Shane Bond]] enabled NZ to escape defeat. The West Indies were 140 for 0 chasing 290 for victory when Gayle hit a 50-over old ball on to the roof of the stand. The replacement balls were all about 10 overs old. The umpire chose one and roughed it up on concrete to artificially age it. The umpire roughed up one side more than other and the ball started to reverse swing. Bond bowled accurately and aggressively and ripped out the middle order in a 4 wicket burst, eventually finishing with 5 for 69.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-www.cricinfo.com/nzvwi/content/story/240544.html|title=A six to rue|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nNZ's top order failed in both innings and NZ was in trouble at 69 for 4 in the first innings and 4 for 88 in the second.

In reply to 192, NZ scored 372 with [[Peter Fulton]] in his second match scoring 75, Fleming got 97 and Astle 65.\n\nIn the West Indies second innings the NZ bowlers stuck to their task and kept chipping away at the demoralized West Indians finally leaving themselves only 36 runs for their fifth victory in 5 consecutive games, their best ever winning streak, indeed their only winning streak of any note. For the West Indies on the other hand, this was their eighth consecutive loss, their worst losing streak in history. Rain in the third test brought both streaks to an end.\n\nIn his last visit to NZ [[Brian Lara]]'s performance was symptomatic of his team's woes. He scored 5, 0, 1, 1 in the first 2 tests which were lost, before getting 83 in the 3rd test which was drawn.\n\n===62 v Sri Lanka at Christchurch 2005/06 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\nScorecard http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/nzvsl/engine/match/251485.html\n\nMurali run out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zgvjC9WUCs\n\nNo regrets on controversial run out \u2013 Fleming http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/nzvsl/content/story/271912.html\n\nEighteen months later McCullum was at it again \u2013 and this time the controversy raged for days. You would, however, have assumed that the man at his mercy, Muttiah Muralitharan, should have known better. He and Kumar Sangakkara had been engaged in a tense battle for survival in a low-scoring contest, and had added 27 vital runs for the tenth wicket when Sangakkara clipped Shane Bond down to fine leg to bring up an excellent century. Murali tapped his bat into his crease to complete the run, then turned at once to congratulate his partner. At the same instant, the return throw came in from the boundary, and McCullum didn't think twice about breaking the wicket and putting in his appeal. The ball was not dead, so it was a justifiable move (if not entirely in the spirit of the game), and when New Zealand lost five wickets in pursuit of 119 for victory, it assumed even greater importance in hindsight. The Sri Lankans were furious, and a week later translated that anger into a crushing series-levelling win \u2013 with their two protagonists sharing the spoils with ten wickets and 156 not out respectively.\n\n===63 v Bangladesh at Dunedin 2007/08 ''NZ won by 9 wickets''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/nzvbdesh/engine/current/match/300429.html|title=1st Test: New Zealand v Bangladesh at Dunedin, Jan 4\u20136, 2008 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nNZ thrashed Bangladesh 3\u20130 in the One Day series just prior to this test so the NZ players and fans had high expectations of two easy victories in the test series as well.

NZ replied with 357 with [[Matthew Bell (cricketer)|Matthew Bell]], who was playing his first test for 6 years, and [[Jacob Oram]] scoring centuries. Apart from Bell, Oram and Martin the NZers batted poorly. Martin is infamous for his lack of ability with the bat but got to double figures (12) for the first time in a record 49 innings.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/4346567a1823.html |title=World's worst tailender reaps glory |work=[[The Press]] |accessdate=15 October 2011}}</ref> NZ's 357 was not a good batting performance on a good pitch against a weak bowling attack.  This was underlined by the Bangladeshi openers, who put on 161 in a record opening stand against all countries.\n\nHowever, on day 3, the NZ bowlers recovered their composure and took all 10 second innings wickets for 93 runs. The four seamers knocked off the top of the order and Vettori (4 for 70) mopped up the tail. NZ did not get the expected innings victory, but they were close with a 9 wicket win well inside 3 days. NZ's opener [[Craig Cumming]] scored 1 & 4 against the weakest attack in test cricket (Zimbabwe had been suspended) but was retained for the next test.\n\nNew Zealand had won all of the five tests they had played against Bangladesh up to this point, but this was the first occasion where they had not won by an innings.\n\n===64 v Bangladesh at Wellington 2007/08 ''NZ won by an innings and 137 runs''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/300430.html|title=2nd Test: New Zealand v Bangladesh at Wellington, Jan 12\u201314, 2008 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nVettori won the toss again and put Bangladesh in again. On a better pitch than the previous test in Dunedin the Bangladeshis could only manage 6 runs more, largely because NZ bowled better than in Dunedin, especially [[Chris Martin (cricketer)|Chris Martin]], who troubled the batsmen with pace, bounce and movement in both directions and picked up his eighth five-wicket haul in Tests, (5\u201365).\n\nBangladesh bowled reasonably well for the first 71 overs of the NZ innings and had NZ at 242 for 6 with [[Stephen Fleming]] out for 87, but then [[Daniel Vettori]] came in and smashed 94 in 87 balls off the tiring Bangladeshi bowlers. NZ finished with 393, a 250 run first innings lead.\n\nAnother poor performance with the bat followed and Bangladesh were all out for 113 before lunch on the third day. [[Stephen Fleming]] took 3 catches in the match and moved into second place on the \"most test catches in the field in a career\" list. He finished the match with 166, 15 behind the leader [[Mark Waugh]]. The innings victory that everyone had expected since the start of the series eventuated (this was NZ's third most comprehensive victory) NZ cricket fans and players turned their eyes to the England series that followed this one. In fact, expectations of Bangladesh were so low even while NZ was playing them most people had at least one eye on England series. [[Jonathan Millmow]] in the ''[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion Post]]'' went so far as to say :\n<blockquote>\n... victory will have a hollow feel.

[[Jamie How]] (92) apart, the NZ top order failed to capitalise on Vettori's luck but [[Ross Taylor]] (120) McCullum (51) and Vettori (88) pushed the NZ total up to 470. The English started batting for a draw right from the off and when they were dismissed for 348 off 173.1 overs after lunch on Day 4 it looked as though they might have succeeded.\n\nIn their second innings NZ sought quick runs; How (39) and Fleming (66) got them up to 99/1 but when NZ tried to lift the tempo they crashed to 141/8. Only Vettori's valuable 35 enabled NZ to declare and set the English 300 to win off 81 overs. The English started positively but [[Kyle Mills]] dismissed the first 4 batsman for 30 runs and the English went back to playing for a draw again. [[Paul Collingwood]] took over an hour to score 2 runs but after he was bowled by Vettori the English tail offered little resistance and NZ won with a session to spare on Day 5.\n\nNZ's four most inexperienced players, How (7 matches), Taylor (3), [[Jeetan Patel]] (2) and Mills (10) made big contributions to this victory. How and Taylor got their highest test scores 92 and 120, respectively and Patel and Mills their best bowling figures 3/107 and 4/16, respectively.\n\nThis was also [[Stephen Fleming]]'s last series for NZ and he finished the series with 111 matches, 7172 career runs, and 171 career catches, all records for NZ.\n\nNZ lost the next 2 tests and as a result lost the series 2\u20131.

As it was Bangladesh were ahead for the first 3 and a half days of the test and NZ only won by 3 wickets.\n\nBangladesh batted first and despite being 4\u201344 managed to get to 245. In addition to Vettori's 5\u201359, [[Iain O'Brien]] also bowled very well for 3\u201336. NZ replied with what Dylan Cleaver writing in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''described as:\n<blockquote>\n\"the nadir, rock bottom, ground zero of batting efforts during the Bracewell era; all against a spin bowling attack that did nothing but put the ball in the right place most of the time\".\n</blockquote> Vettori batting at eight, top scored with 55* out of 171.\n \nBangladesh's second bat was a repeat of the first; 4\u201349 then recovering to 242, Vettori took 4\u201374.\n\nNZ were left with a target of 317 to win. NZ's top 3 all managed decent contributions this time around but when number 3, [[Jesse Ryder]] (38) fell at 145 just before stumps on the fourth day, Vettori either sent himself in as nightwatchman, or promoted himself to number 4 because he didn't have faith in middle order. Publicly, it is the former, but many suspect the latter.  Vettori added 40 with opener [[Aaron Redmond]] (79) and 82 with [[Daniel Flynn (cricketer)|Daniel Flynn]] (49).  When Vettori finally fell at 298 he had scored 27% of NZ runs, had dismissed 45% of the Bangladeshis, and had saved NZ from an embarrassing defeat.\n\nNZ's target of 317 was the second highest score NZ had chased to win a test.

Pakistan eventually recovered to 332 and Bond finished with 5\u2013107.\n\nAlthough Ross Taylor got another fifty, (59) inept batting from NZ in the second innings saw them all out for 153, leaving Pakitan a target of just 251. However, NZ's bowling attack of Bond, [[Chris Martin (cricketer)|Chris Martin]], [[Iain O'Brien]] and Vettori bowled well enough to make up for the brainless batting of the NZ batsmen in the second innings. Pakistan were all out for 219. Bond took 3\u201346.\n\nBond however bowled 48.5 overs in the match, suffered an injury, and was invalided out of the rest of the series.

The entire match was completed in just over two days of playing time.\n\nNew Zealand was put in to bat by Zimbabwe and scored 495/7 declared. [[Martin Guptill]] (51) and [[Brendon McCullum]] (83) laid the foundation with an opening partnership of 124. [[Ross Taylor]] scored 122 before retiring hurt and [[BJ Watling]], playing as the wicket keeper for the first time, scored his first century for New Zealand.  NZ declared soon after Watling reached his hundred.\nOnly 15 overs were possible on the second day of the match but the weather was perfect for day 3.  NZ used the first 18 overs of the day to add another 103 runs and then the same four pace bowlers that ran through Australia in Hobart two months before, bowled Zimbabwe out twice in the same the day.\n\n[[Chris Martin (cricketer)|Chris Martin]], [[Trent Boult]], [[Doug Bracewell]] and [[Tim Southee]] all took 2 wickets in Zimbabwe's first innings of 51. This was the lowest scored NZ had ever bowled a test team out for.\n \nZimbabwe followed on and fared a little better, all out for 143. Martin's 6\u201326 in the innings was his best performance in first class cricket, and was the 10th best bowling performance for NZ. He was named man-of-the match. Martin also moved into third place on the [[List of Test cricket records for New Zealand#Player records|most-wickets-for-New Zealand list]], behind [[Richard Hadlee]] and [[Daniel Vettori]] and tied with [[Chris Cairns]].\n\nZimbabwe did not play test cricket from September 2005 to August 2011.

Instead NZ went into this match having lost five tests in a row. It was New Zealand's first Test win in Sri Lanka since 1998.\n\nNZ won the toss and batted but soon found themselves in the familiar situation of being two down for not very many. However, [[Kane Williamson]] (135) and [[Ross Taylor]] (142) put on 262 \u2013 NZ's sixth highest partnership. [[Daniel Flynn (cricketer)|Daniel Flynn]] (53) and the tail provided some more runs and NZ finished with 412. Williamson's 135 was his highest score.\n\n[[Tim Southee]], swinging the new ball beautifully, led the attack and Sri Lanka were 12\u20133 and then 105\u20135. Southee snared 4 of the first 5 wickets to fall. As the ball aged the Sri Lankans found batting easier but when Southee and [[Trent Boult]] got hold of the second new ball they lost their last 4 wickets for 19 runs. Southee finished with 5\u201362 and Boult with 4\u201342. This was Boult's best bowling in an innings.\n\nNZ had a 168 run first-innings lead but a collapse to 75\u20135 in their second innings set kiwi supporter's hearts a flutter, but then Taylor (74) and [[Todd Astle]] (35), on his debut put on 97 runs. NZ declared at 194/9 setting Sri Lanka 363 runs to win.\n\nSouthee and [[Doug Bracewell]] reduced Sri Lanka to 47\u20134 at stumps on the fourth day. Sri Lanka's second top order failure of the match left them with only one option \u2013 to play for a draw. They limped through to 168/7 before Taylor took the second new ball and Boult and Southee cleaned up the tail in six overs. Sri Lanka were all out for 195.\n\nTaylor scored 216 runs in the match and Williamson 153. Both Southee (8\u2013120) and Boult (7\u201375) got their best bowling figures in a match. David Leggat writing in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''said:\n\n<blockquote>\nSouthee, since returning after missing the first test in India in August, has taken 20 wickets in three tests, including a career-best seven for 64 at Bangalore. He is now the country's leading fast-medium bowler... Boult has found his feet at the top level and the ability to bring the ball in late to the righthanders and slide it across makes him a genuine threat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10851213|title=Cricket: Consistency's the next big test|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nTaylor was ranked the 8th best batsmen in the world after this match. McCullum was the NZ's next highest ranked batsman at 27th.\n\nSoon after Taylor's match winning performance he was sacked as captain by NZ Cricket. It later emerged that coach [[Mike Hesson]] told Taylor that he was going to recommend that Taylor be replaced as captain before the Sri Lankan series had even begun. After his performance in the second test NZ Cricket offered Taylor the test captaincy as a compromise. Taylor refused this offer and also refused to tour South Africa in December 2012 and January 2013.\n \nThe reason given for his sacking was his poor winning record over his 13 tests \u2212 4 won, 7 lost, and 2 drawn. In fact, Taylor's record as captain is very similar to Stephen Fleming's and Daniel Vettori's. Fleming won 5 of his first 13 tests and Vettori 4. David Leggat writing in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' states that the poor winning record is not entirely Taylor's fault and doubts whether installing McCullum as captain will make any difference.\n\nThe following table shows that the only batsman adequately performing during his tenure was Ross Taylor himself.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!  !!Matches !!

Some play was lost to rain in this test as well but not enough to prevent NZ winning on the third day of the test. Just as in Dunedin, the West Indies skipper won the toss and had no hesitation in putting New Zealand in on a green pitch. Just as in Dunedin the West Indies bowled poorly and NZ amassed a big first innings score. The openers failed again but [[Ross Taylor]] and [[Kane Williamson]] (45) put on 88 for the third wicket, Taylor and [[Brendon McCullum]](37) put on 77 for the fourth wicket, and Taylor and [[Corey Anderson]] (38) put on 68 for the fifth wicket. Taylor's 129 was his tenth Test hundred and his second century in consecutive tests. He scored 217 in Dunedin. After Taylor departed at 296, [[BJ Watling]] and the tail added a further 145 runs.\n\nAt the end of day two the West Indies were reasonably well placed at 158/4, chasing NZ's first innings score of 441. However, on they morning of the third day they collapsed to NZ's swing and pace in a further 12.5 overs and were dismissed for 193. [[Trent Boult]] took 6 of the last 7 wickets to fall and finished with 6/40.\n\nFollowing on the West Indies got to 74 without loss but [[Tim Southee]] took 3 quick wickets.

They went to lunch comfortably placed at 77/1. After lunch they lost 4 for 9 and slumped to 86/5 on a pitch that was not assisting the seamers to any degree. The West Indies put on 200 for the sixth wicket and were looking good at 286/5 but were eventually bowled out for 367. [[Tim Southee]] took 4/79 and [[Corey Anderson]] 3/49.\n\nOn a pitch taking turn the NZ openers again got starts but failed to go on. Ross Taylor was again involved in good partnerships with the middle order batsmen. He put on 95 with [[Kane Williamson]] (58), 36 with McCullum (12), 50 with Anderson (39), and 45 with Watling. When Taylor (131) got out at 306/7 he had again held the New Zealand innings together and had scored his third century in successive tests. New Zealand finished with a small first innings deficit of 17.\n\nWith a small first innings lead, and a fine spinner in Sunil Narine to bowl at NZ who had to bat fourth on a pitch taking spin, the West Indies were in the box seat at tea on the third day. However the West Indies were all out for a 103 in a single session. New Zealand's four-man pace attack were relentless with their tight lines and fuller lengths. [[Trent Boult]] took the first three West Indies wickets and [[Tim Southee]] took three wickets in the last over of the innings to end with 3\u201312 \u2013 his second wicket making him the 12th New Zealand player to capture 100 test wickets. Boult finished with 4\u201323.\n\nNew Zealand had to chase down 122 to win. [[Kane Williamson]] scored 56 and [[Hamish Rutherford]] 48*.\n\nNew Zealand completed their first series victory over a top-eight nation since they beat the same opposition in 2006. Against one of the weakest West Indies side to ever visit New Zealand, the homeside were dominant in all three matches. But for rain in Dunedin they would have won the series 3\u20130.\n\nDeposed captain [[Ross Taylor]] scored three centuries in each of the three tests finishing the series with 495 runs at an average of 247.50. At the end of the series his career average stood at 47.51 which is better than the averages that [[Martin Crowe]] (45.36) and [[Glenn Turner]] (44.64) finished their careers with. At the end of this series only two New Zealanders had more centuries than Taylor \u2013 Martin Crowe (17) and John Wright (12).\n\nAll-rounder [[Corey Anderson]], playing in his first home series, took 8 wickets at an average of 18.37 and scored 97 runs at an average of 32.33. [[Kane Williamson]] also averaged 53 with the bat. Boult took 20 wickets in the series at an average of 15.40 while Southee grabbed 18 scalps at 18.11\n\n=== 75 v India at Auckland 2013/14 ''NZ won by 40 runs'' ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-india-2014/engine/current/match/667651.html|title=1st Test: New Zealand v India at Auckland, Feb 6\u20139, 2014 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nOn a grassy drop-in pitch at Eden Park, the Indian captain was delighted to win the toss and bowl. Not long after, New Zealand were 30 for 3. [[Kane Williamson]] and [[Brendon McCullum]] responded with aggressive hundreds and added 221 in 51 overs. Williamson scored 113 and McCullum was not out on 143 at the end of day one. NZ was in complete control of the match at 329/4.\n\nThe following day McCullum added another 174 runs with the tail and was last out for 224, one short of his highest test score. [[Corey Anderson]] scored 77 and New Zealand finished with 503.\n\n[[Trent Boult]] took two wickets in the first over of India's innings and [[Tim Southee]] bounced out [[Virat Kohli]] in the fifth over. India recovered somewhat to end day two on 130/4. On a humid day three morning the New Zealand fast bowlers ripped through India. In 13 overs from Boult and Southee, India could manage only 28 for 2. Once Southee and Boult finished their spells, [[Neil Wagner]] maintained the same intensity and picked up three of the last four wickets. The tail could only add 35 runs after Dhoni's dismissal and India were bowled out for 202, 45 minutes before lunch. Both Boult and Southee took 3/38 and Wagner 4/64.\n\nBizarrely, McCullum did not enforce the follow-on. New Zealand's second innings was a classic example of a Black Caps batting collapse. They were 15/4 at lunch on the third day. [[Ross Taylor]] top scored with 41 and the last pair added 25. Nevertheless, the 301-run first innings lead combined with their second innings score of 105 left India with a very challenging target of 407 to win in over two days on a flat wicket. (The highest successful fourth innings target is 418)\n\nThe Indian top order kept their team in the chase. After 80 overs India were well placed at 268/5. However, the arrival of the second new ball sealed their fate. Boult took a wicket with the first delivery of the second new ball and Southee with the seventh. India lost their last 5 wickets for 98 runs in 16.3 overs against the second new ball and NZ secured a thrilling 40-run win. The NZ fast bowlers, Southee, Boult, and Wagner took all 20 wickets in the match. Southee, Boult took 3 wickets in each innings and Wagner took 4 wickets in each innings. Neil Wagner's match figures of 8 for 126 were his best in a Test Match. His previous-best was 7 for 116 against Bangladesh in Mirpur last year. McCullum was named the player of the match.\nDavid Leggat in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nTim Southee, Trent Boult and Neil Wagner have a look about them that suggests they are well down the road to becoming one of New Zealand's better seam groups. Southee and Boult have tended to garner more headlines than the bustling Otago left armer Wagner. But on Sunday, as Wagner charged in during a hostile 10-over spell on a warm afternoon when the test was in the balance, he was outstanding. Seldom can a spell of 10\u20133\u201326\u20132 by a New Zealand bowler have had an impact so far outweighing the bare numbers. He removed Virat Kohli when the Indian champion was sailing along on 67, then produced a snorting lifter to remove centurymaker Shikhar Dhawan to turn the contest at a point where India were in cruise mode.\n<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11199595 | work=The New Zealand Herald | title=Cricket: Hard-working trio becoming force to be reckoned with \u2013 Sport \u2013 NZ Herald News | date=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Jesse Ryder]] who had made a return to playing limited overs cricket for NZ was named as 12th man.

Even though they did not make the team they sure made the headlines and the NZ cricket team were reportedly livid that their misbehaviour gained more attention that their stunning victory.\n\nDespite most of the batsmen performing adequately (see table below) during McCullum's first 13 tests, he actually won fewer tests than [[Ross Taylor]] \u2013 Taylor won 4 tests out of 13 and McCullum 3 out of 13.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!  !!Matches !!

On 25 November 2014, [[Phillip Hughes]] was knocked unconscious by a bouncer, during a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n\nOn 26 November, Pakistan won toss, chose to bat on a flat track and reached 281/3. The following day Hughes died and the New Zealand team considered forfeiting the match. However, in the end the teams decided to suspend the test for one day.\n\nAfter the test resumed on 27 November, Pakistan collapsed to be all out for 351. The Pakistani captain said\n\n\"... after [Hughes death] it was really difficult to concentrate. It was very difficult for the batsmen to carry on when we came out on the third day. It created difficulties for us.\" [[Mark Craig]], the NZ offspinner, ran through the bottom half of Pakistan's batting to register a career-best haul of 7 for 94.\n \nCraig said that his mind was not on the game. \" [I] didn't really think, to be honest. It was hard playing and we boys tried to stick together,\" Craig said. \"Just not thinking about bowling and letting the ball go was a big help.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-new-zealand-2014/content/current/story/805939.html|title=Batsmen lost focus on the third morning \u2013 Misbah|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe New Zealanders did not celebrate the fall of each Pakistan wicket with the usual whooping and high-fives.\n\nWhen New Zealand batted, Brendon McCullum (202) and Kane Williamson (192) appeared to have no difficulty concentrating and they put on 297 \u2013 the highest ever partnership for the second wicket. [[Ross Taylor]], [[Corey Anderson]], [[Mark Craig]], and [[Tim Southee]] also scored fifties and NZ amassed 690 \u2013 the highest innings total for NZ.\n\nPakistan had to score 339 just to make NZ bat again or bat for five-and-a-half sessions to save the Test. They managed neither. [[Trent Boult]] dismissed the first 3 batsmen and Pakistan were reeling at 24 for 3. Mark Craig snared two more and Pakistan were 63 for 5. Pakistan were eventually dismissed for 259. Boult took 4 for 38. Craig got 3 more wickets to give him match figures of 10 for 203.\n\nThe match was littered with records and personal milestones:\n\n*690 was NZ' highest innings total.\n*It was the first time six NZ batsmen had scored over 50 in an innings.\n*McCullum and Williamson's 297-run partnership is NZ's highest for the second wicket.\n*McCullum's reached 50 in 30 balls \u2013 the second fastest 50 in NZ test history.\n*McCullum's reached 100 in 78 balls \u2013 the fastest century in NZ test history.\n*McCullum had scored two double centuries and a triple century in a calendar year.\n*Williamson's 192 was his highest test score\n*Williamson's 8th test century was the most by any New Zealander at age 24.\n*Craig is the fifth New Zealander to score a fifty and take 10 wickets in a match. He was also named man of the match\n\nHowever, the shadow of Phillip Hughes' death loomed throughout the Test with players from both teams hardly showing emotions on personal achievements. Vettori summed up the mood: \"We felt like he was one of us and we mourned him as a team-mate.\"\n\nVettori was playing in his first test match since July 2012. He was asked to play at the last minute as NZ wanted to play 3 spinners. He agreed on the proviso that his work load would be small.\n\nThis turned out to be Vettori's last test. He played 113 tests, scored 4531 runs and took 362 wickets.\n\nDylan Cleaver and David Leggat in the NZ herald rated this win one of NZ's five best overseas victories and discussed whether the current teams was one of NZ's best ever sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11369019|title=Cricket: Golden eras vie for mantle of most legendary|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== 79 v Sri Lanka at Christchurch 2014/15 ''NZ won by 8 wickets'' ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-sri-lanka-2014-15/engine/match/749777.html|title=1st Test: New Zealand v Sri Lanka at Christchurch, Dec 26\u201329, 2014 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nTest cricket returned to Christchurch after an eight-year absence at a new venue \u2013 [[Hagley Park, Christchurch|Hagley Park]]. [[Lancaster Park]] was damaged beyond repair in the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].\n\nSri Lanka won the toss and inserted NZ on a green wicket. However, they bowled poorly and took 19 overs to reduce New Zealand to 88 for 3. The fall of [[Ross Taylor]]'s wicket bought [[Brendon McCullum]] to the crease and he nearly scored the fastest double century in test history. He smashed 195 off 134 balls. He added 126 with [[Kane Williamson]] (54) who only contributed 20 runs to this partnership. [[Jimmy Neesham]] also scored 85 off 80 balls and helped NZ score 427 runs on the first day of this test match off only 80.3 overs \u2013 the second-highest they have ever made in a day's Test cricket.\n\nSri Lanka were unable to cope with the swing and seam of [[Tim Southee]] and [[Trent Boult]]. Boult dismissed the first 3 batsmen and Sri Lanka were in deep trouble 15 for 3. Boult eventually finished with 3 for 25 and [[Neil Wagner]] 3 for 60.\n\nMcCullum enforced the follow-on but the NZ bowlers were unable to repeat their first innings performance, and took 154 overs to bowl the Sri Lankans out for 407. Boult took 4 for 100 and Southee 4 for 91.\n\nNew Zealand needed to score only 107 to win and did so with the loss of 2 wickets.\n\nThis was New Zealand's fifth win of 2014 \u2013 their most ever in a calendar year. New Zealand played 9 \u2013 Won 5, lost 2 and drew 2. McCullum and Williamson were the stars with the bat. In 2014, McCullum scored two double centuries, a triple century and 195. Southee & Boult were the stars with the ball and after this match [[Russel Arnold]] described them as the best new-ball pair around. \nhttp://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/video_audio/814775.html\n\n[[Ross Taylor]] had a quiet year but was still ranked as the eleventh best batsmen in the world. (ICC rankings) McCullum was 12th and Williamson was 13th. Boult was ranked the 7th best bowler and Southee the 9th.

However the Sri Lankans won the toss for the second time in a row and sent NZ in to bat. The pitch did not seem as difficult as expected and NZ was untroubled reaching 141 for 2 in 32 overs. The Sri Lankans bowled more economically and NZ lost 8 wickets for 80 runs playing ambitious shots. [[Kane Williamson]] (69) top-scored in NZ's 221.\n\nThe New Zealand bowlers found swing straightaway and at the end of day 1 Sri Lanka were in deep trouble at 78 for 5. On day 2, [[Kumar Sangakkara]] (33 not out overnight) not only survived the NZ swing bowling, he scored 203 and added a further 278 with the last 5 batsmen and gave Sri Lanka a 135-run first innings lead.\n\nNZ lost 4 wickets wiping of the deficit and when Nesham fell, NZ were only 25 ahead with 5 wickets left. However the wicket was now a good batting strip and [[Kane Williamson]] and [[BJ Watling]] batted slowly and carefully to see NZ through to 253 for 5 and the end of day 3.\n\nOn Day 4, Williamson and Watling batted on and when [[Brendon McCullum]] finally declared on 524 for 5 they held the record for all countries for the highest sixth wicket partnership \u2013 365 unbroken.\n \nStatistical highlights include:\n*Williamson's 242* was his highest test score.\n*Watling's 142* was his highest test score.\n*Watling broke his own partnership record \u2013 the previous record of 352 (scored with McCullum) was less than a year old. A bronze plaque commemorating the old record had been set in concrete at the [[Basin Reserve]] just three days earlier.\n*The partnershipis was New Zealand's third highest for any wicket.\n\nMcCullum's declaration set Sri Lankan a target of 390 to win in 107 overs. Even though the pitch was still easy for batting Sri Lanka were all out for 196. [[Trent Boult]] and [[Doug Bracewell]] did the early damage before [[Mark Craig]] (4\u201353) ran through the tail to complete one of New Zealand's most remarkable Test wins. Only once before had New Zealand they had recovered from a first innings deficit of more than 100 to win a game. The only other example was victory number 32 against Pakistan in 1994 and it is possible Pakistan threw this match.\n \nIf Sri Lanka's fielding had been better the result could have been very different. Williamson was dropped on 29, 60 and 104.\n\nWilliamson's average at the end of this test was 45.95, higher than [[Martin Crowe]]'s final average of 45.36 and higher than [[Ross Taylor]]'s current average of 45.40. He also took the least number of innings of any New Zealander to reach 3000 runs (71-two fewer than Crowe).

England won the toss and put NZ in and soon had them 68\u20133. While [[Tom Latham (cricketer)|Tom Latham]] compiled a careful 84, the middle order and lower order scored at better than a run a ball. [[Luke Ronchi]] on his debut aged 34 scored 88 off 70 balls. The final total of 350 was scored at 4.84 runs per over. Ronchi, the reserve keeper, was only playing because Watling's knee was too sore for him to keep wicket.\n\nEngland's openers responded with a first wicket stand of 177 and threatened to take the game away from NZ. However [[Tim Southee]] and [[Trent Boult]] got NZ back in the game by destroying England's middle order. They took 7 for 90. Runs from Englands's last 3 batsmen enabled them to match NZ's first innings score of 350. Southee took 4 \u2013 83.\n\nWith the weather forecast poor for the remainder of the match NZ again sought quick runs in the second innings but lost two quick wickets. This did not slow down the scoring rate however and [[Martin Guptill]] 70 and [[Ross Taylor]] 48 both scored at a run a ball. [[Brendon McCullum]] scored a relatively slow 55 but [[BJ Watling]] who scored his fifth test century put on quick runs with the lower middle order. Ronchi 31, [[Mark Craig]] 58* Southee 40, and [[Matt Henry (cricketer)|Matt Henry]] 12 all scored at a brisk pace. NZ scored 190 runs in the last 30 overs of the innings. When Watling fell at 368 the slog began. Craig, Southee and Henry added 88 runs in 8 overs. McCullum declared at 454/8 off 91 overs. The run rate was 4.98.\n\nMuch of the fourth day was lost to rain so the rate at which NZ batted was crucial to giving them enough time to bowl England out. England was 44 with out loss at the end of day 4. Overnight some of the English players talked up their chances of chasing down what would be a record target of 454 to win. However, in the first 15 overs of day 5 England scored 18 runs and lost 4 wickets. Boult got 2 and Craig got 2 in one over. At 62 for 4 England were battling for a draw. [[Kane Williamson]] later picked up 3 wickets with his part-time spin and England were all out with 20 overs still left in the day.\n\nStarting with Bangladesh series in October 2013 this was seventh unbeaten series, most by any New Zealand side. During the game, Hesson and McCullum were awarded the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for NZ's wonderful performance in the Cricket World Cup \u2013 NZ lost to Australia in the final.\n\n== 2015/16 to 2025 ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Played  \n| '''WON '''10\n| Lost \n| Drew \n|-\n|}\n\nfrom July 2015 to 2025\n\n===82 v Sri Lanka at Dunedin 2015/16 ''NZ won by 122 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-sri-lanka-2015-16/engine/match/914203.html Scorecard]\n\nNew Zealand were in control of this match from start to finish. The Sri Lankan captain won the toss but put NZ in to bat to protect his inexperienced batsmen from the potent swing of [[Tim Southee]] and [[Trent Boult]]. Even so, Sri Lanka did not take a wicket until the 16th over. Opener[[Martin Guptill]] (156) and [[Kane Williamson]] (88) then put on 173 for the second wicket. [[Brendon McCullum]] then smashed 75 runs off 57 balls and [[Doug Bracewell]] a more sedate 47 off 59 balls. NZ scored 409/8 on the first day and were finally all out for 431. The run rate was 4.48 per over.\n\nOn a good pitch Sri Lanka could only score at 2.5 runs per over. They crawled to 197/4 at the close of day two. On the moring of day three NZ picked up the final 6 wickets for 97 runs. Sri Lanka were eventually dismissed for 294 in 117.1 overs, conceding a first-innings lead of 137. Southee had the best bowling figures of 3/71.\n\nIn the third innings it was the other openers turn to score a century. [[Tom Latham (cricketer)|Tom Latham]] put on 79 with Guptil and then 141 with Williamson (71). During this innings Williamson scored his thousandth run in 2015. Latham's 109* was his third test century. With one eye on the weather McCullum declared before lunch on Day 4. NZ's 267/3, at 4.06 per over, set Sri Lanka a target of 405.\n\nSri Lanka limped to 109/3 off 50 overs at the end of a rain interrupted day 4. Day 5 dawned sunny. However, on a good batting pitch NZ found wickets hard to come by. Throughout the match Boult and Southee bowled mostly a full length looking for swing. [[Neil Wagner]] however often targeted the batsmens ribs, hustling them with pace, forcing hurried evasive actions and awkward fends off the body. Wagner offered something different on a flat pitch and broke stubborn partnerships. NZ bowled Sri Lanka out for 282 ten overs after lunch on day 5. Sri Lanka batted for 40 more overs than NZ in the match but their much slower run rate meant they scored 122 runs fewer.\n\nAt the end of the match [[Kane Williamson]] was ranked the third best batsman in the world by the ICC player rankings.\n\n===83 v Sri Lanka at Hamilton 2015/16 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-sri-lanka-2015-16/engine/match/914205.html  Scorecard]\n\n[[Brendon McCullum]] won the toss and put Sri Lanka in to bat on a pitch so green the Sri Lankan coach claimed it had been \"doctored\" and had 18mm of grass on it. However, there was not much swing and seam on offer and [[Tim Southee]] didn't get the first wicket until the 13th over. Sri Lanka were 259 for 4 at one stage but NZ picked up the last 6 wickets for 33 runs. 292 turned out to be the highest innings of the match. [[Tim Southee]] was the best bowler taking 3 for 63.\n\nSri Lanka's bowlers could not find much swing or seam either and NZ openers put on 81 for the first wicket. [[Martin Guptill]] made 50. Sri Lanka tried bowling bouncers and like moths to a flame the NZ top and middle order hooked, pulled and slogged their way back to the dressing room. [[Kane Williamson]]'s hook shot to a ball over his head and outside off stump was one of the worst of the lot. NZ was 89 for 4 and then 128 for 5. The lower order managed the short ball better but most eventually fell to bouncers and NZ were all out for 237 conceding a first innings lead of 55.\n\nThe NZ bowlers began by bowling outside off stump looking for swing and seam. The Sri Lankan openers put on 71 runs before the NZ bowlers gave up and started bowling bouncers. The quickening pitch did not have had much seam but there was plenty of bounce. McCullum set fields reminiscent of the bodyline series in the 1930s and the Sri Lankan batsmen obliged by hooking and pulling into the traps set and in a barely believable collapse lost 10 wickets for 62 runs.  Southee took 4 for 26 and [[Neil Wagner]] 3 for 40.\n\nNZ was set 189 to win. Sri Lanka starting bowling bouncers right from the outset. Opener [[Tom Latham (cricketer)|Tom Latham]] got hit on the head and then hooked the ball down square leg for 4. The other opener [[Martin Guptill]] fended a good short ball to leg slip. Willamson and Taylor (35) added 67 before Taylor hooked a bouncer to fine leg. Williamson and Brendon \"That's-just-the-way-I-play\" McCullum (18) added 52 before McCullum slogged a short ball straight up in the air. Williamson and [[Mitchell Santner]] (4) added 12 before Satner edged a good short ball to the keeper. At the end of day three NZ was 142 for 5, Williamson was on 78* and [[BJ Watling]] on 0*.\n\nOn Day 4, Williamson farmed the strike and got to his 13th test century before Watling got off the mark. Williamson added 42 with Watling and carried NZ to a 5 wicket victory. Unlike most of the other batsmen in the match Williamson learned from his first innings mistake, and was able to resist hooking or pulling anything above shoulder height. He scored an unbeaten 108, and won the match for New Zealand.\n\nAt the end of the match Williamson:\n* had scored 1172 runs in the calendar year \u2013 more than any other New Zealander ( average 90.15)\n* had scored 5 centuries in a calendar year \u2013 more than any other New Zealander.\n* increased his test average to 49.93.\n* scored the second most centuries by any New Zealander (13)\n* was ranked the number one test batsmen in the world by the ICC.\n\nNew Zealand equalled its longest unbeaten sequence of tests at home: 13.\n\nAfter the match McCullum announced that the following two tests against Australia in February 2016 would be his last.\n\nIn April 2016 Wisden named Williamson as the leading cricketer in the world for 2015.\n\n===84 v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo 2016 ''NZ won by an innings and 117 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/zimbabwe-v-new-zealand-2016/engine/match/1024041.html Scorecard]\n\nZimbabwe won the toss and chose to bat on a tame surface. Although Southee swung the ball he was only able to pick up one early wicket. Boult was unable to find much movement in the air at all. Wagner employed a short-ball strategy and the hosts fell from 35 for 1 to 36 for 4, and then, in the post-lunch session, lost four wickets with the score on 72. Wagner eventually took his career-best in an innings of 6 for 41. Zimbabwe were only saved from being dismissed for the lowest first-innings score in Bulawayo by their tail. At one stage they were 72 for 8 but they scored 164.\n\nThe NZ openers put on 79 with easy before Guptill was out for 40. Latham (105) and Williamson (91) put on 156 for the second wicket and carried NZ well past the Zimbabwe first innings score with just one wicket down. Taylor (173*) and Watling (107) put on 253 for the sixth wicket. Williamson, in his first test as captain, declared when Watling fell at 576 for 6. Zimbabwe had not played a test match for 20 months and their bowlers were no match for a strong New Zealand batting line up.\n\nZimbabwe were chasing 412 to avoid an innings defeat. After 4 overs Boult and Southee had reduced them to 17 for 4. Wagner bounced one more out and later they were 85 for 6 and staring at another mediocre score. However, the last 5 wickets scored 209 runs. The second innings total of 295 was a vast improvement over the first innings but Zimbabwe were comprehensively out played by a strong New Zealand team.\n\n===85 v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo 2016 ''NZ won by 254 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10694/scorecard/1024043/zimbabwe-vs-new-zealand-2nd-test-new-zealand-tour-of-zim-2016/ Scorecard]\n\nThe second test of the series was also played in Bulawayo not in the capital Harare. There was no tests in Harare for the Kiwis on this tour because Harare was the epicentre of a nationwide strikes to protest the lack of jobs, unpaid wages of public servants and general economic mismanagement by the Mugabe regime.\n\nThe protesters also came to Bulawayo. At the start of the 36th over some of the spectators stood up and sang the national anthem and waived the Zimbabwean flag. The 36 refers to the number of years Mugabe had been in to power.  The mismanagement of Zimbabwean cricket along with everything else in Zimbabwe left their cricket team weak and open to slaughter.\n\nThe entire Zimbabwe team had only 43 caps. 8 NZ players had played more than 20 tests. Williamson and Southee's were playing in their 50th test and Ross Taylor in his 71st.\n\nWhen the protesters started waiving their flags at the start of the 36th over, NZ who had won the toss and chose to bat first were 120 for none. At the end of day 1, NZ were 329 for 2. Guptill scored 87 and Latham 136. NZ declared at 582 for 4. Williamson scored 113, Taylor 124* and Watling 83*.\nWhen Zimbabwe had their turn on a flat track they replied with 362, Sodhi taking 4 for 60 \u2013 his best bowling in an innings.\n\nWilliamson chose not to enforce the follow on. Instead the New Zealanders sought quick runs. Unfortunately, they lost both openers trying to force the pace. However, Williamson (68*) and Taylor (67*) were able to prosper and NZ scored 166 for 2 off 36 overs. Williamson's declaration set Zimbabwe a target of 387 to win.\n\nIn their run chase, Zimbabwe was a victim of some truly terrible umpiring with 4 poor decisions in their total of 132. Sodhi got 3 for 19, and Guptill with his part-time off spin 3 for 11 \u2013 his best bowling in an innings.\n\nNew Zealand's victory by 254 runs was their biggest in terms of runs. Over the two tests Ross Taylor scored 364 runs without being dismissed and improved his career batting average to 48.66. Williamson averaged 136 in 2 tests and improved his career average to 51.29. Latham, Watling and Guptill also improved their batting averages, and Wagner, Boult, Sodhi and Santner improved their bowling averages\n\n===86 v Pakistan at Christchurch 2016/17 ''NZ won by 8 wickets''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10677/scorecard/1019993/new-zealand-vs-pakistan-1st-test-pakistan-tour-of-nz-2016-17/ Scorecard]\n\nPakistan's came to NZ as the number two test side in the world. However, they had to face not only the Black Caps but the elements too. Their warm-up game in Nelson was abandoned without a ball being bowled and the 7.8 magnitude 2016 Kaikoura earthquake at two minutes after midnight on 14 November left some members of Pakistani team so afraid to return to their hotel room that they preferred to sleep in the hotel lobby. After arriving in Christchurch not only were they greeted with hundreds of aftershocks but with spring weather and a Hagley oval green-top.\n\nNZ had two new debutants, [[Colin de Grandhomme]] and [[Jeet Raval]]. After the first day had been rained off Williamson won the toss and put the Pakistanis in.\nPakistan survived the first hour against Boult and Southee but after de Grandhomme, bowling first change, removed Azhar Ali, the floodgates opened.  De Grandhomme's slower pace but greater accuracy made his swing and seam more dangerous than Boult and Southee. De Grandhomme's 6 for 41 was the best performance by a NZ debutant. Pakistan scored 133.\n \nThere was still plenty of life in the pitch when NZ batted, but the other debutant Jeet Raval look at ease while his while his partners struggled. De Grandhomme scored a quickfire 29 and the last 5 NZ batsmen scored 64. By contrast the last 5 Pakistani batsmen scored just 23 runs. Raval scored 55 out of 200.\n\nNZ's 67 run first innings lead was invaluable as Pakistan lost 3 wickets knocking it off. The first 3 Pakistan batsman managed to bat for 40 overs but scored at only 1.45 runs per over. Eventually Wagner bowled a barrage of short balls aimed at the ribs and took 2 for 9 off 11 overs. Wagner got his 100th wicket in his 26th test. Only Hadlee reached this mark faster for NZ (in his 25th test). Boult and Southee then finished the Pakistanis off. Boult got 3/37, Southee 3/54 and Wagner 3/34.\n\nKane Williamson described his teams bowling in Pakistan's second innings as the \"decisive period\". He also said:\n\n\"We were hoping for some movement off the surface and Pakistan showed a lot of resistance \u2013 especially early \u2013 and were very patient. But the way that four seamers got into spells and held their areas for long periods at a time, it was world-class. They passed it over for the next bloke to take up the baton, and it was a huge effort being patient and getting the rewards later on in the day yesterday. We didn't get the ball to do a huge amount in the second innings, but we held our lines and our lengths really consistently for a long period of time. It was really important to make that adjustment quickly and not get too greedy and overpitch, because in the first innings you did need to bowl fuller to get those rewards.\"<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-pakistan-2016-17/content/story/1067381.html</ref>\n\nApart from Latham going early, NZ had no trouble scoring the required 105 runs for victory. Williamson scored 61 and fittingly Raval (36*) hit the winning runs. Colin de Grandhomme was the player of the match.\n\n===87 v Pakistan at Hamilton 2016/17 ''NZ won by 138 runs''===\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10677/scorecard/1019995/new-zealand-vs-pakistan-2nd-test-pakistan-tour-of-nz-2016-17/ Scorecard]\n\nAfter viewing the green pitch in Hamilton, Pakistan picked an all-seam attack and as luck would have it won the toss. The Pakistani bowlers were not as accurate as the conditions demanded and wasted their opportunity to run through NZ. Rain saw that only 21 overs were possible on day 1 and NZ got to 77/2. On day 2 NZ lost 3 early wickets and were 119 for 5. Raval in his second test scored 55. The lower rallied around Watling (49*) and NZ's total of 271 was a good return on a green pitch.\n\nWhen Pakistan batted, Tim Southee on his home ground bowled much fuller and in reduced Pakistan to 12 for 3 in 9 overs. Wagner later got two wickets in two balls and Pakistan were 51 for 5. Rain allowed only 38 overs of play on day 3. Southee got another three wickets and finished with 6/80 and Wagner 3/59. Trent Boult could not play in this test due to injury. Pakistan scored 216.\n\nBy day 4, the pitch had flattened out considerably, and was offering much less seam movement. The sun was out and NZ piled on the runs. NZ's run rate accelerated through the day.  Latham (80) and Williamson (42) scored slowly but set a foundation for the middle order. Taylor (102*) scored his 16th test hundred off 134 balls and Colin de Grandhomme scored 32 off 21 balls. NZ declared at 313/5 and set Pakistan a target of 369 on day 5.\n\nAt lunch on day 5, Pakistan were 76 for none. At tea Pakistan were 158 for 1. They need 211 off at least 34 overs with 9 wickets left (a run rate of 6.2) \nAt the fall of the second wicket Pakistan promoted their hard-hitting keeper to number four in an effort to get the target. However he ran himself out at for 19. At 199 for 4, Pakistan appeared to shut up shop. At this stage there were around 24 overs left for Pakistan to survive. However they collapsed in dramatic fashion. They lost their 5th wicket with 20 overs left, their 6th wicket with 17 overs left and their 7th wicket with 12 overs left in the match. Wagner took the 8th and 9th wickets with 11 overs left and then he took the last wicket with 9 overs left. Pakistan had collapsed from a seemingly impregnable 158 for 1 at tea to 230 all out in 25.1 overs. They lost 9 wicket for 72 runs in the last session of the match. Wagner finished with 3 for 57.\n\nSouthee was named Man of the Match.\n\nIn their debut series, opener Raval scored 2 fifties and finished with a test average of 49.33. All-rounder de Grandhomme averaged 32.66 with the bat, and took 9 wickets at an average of 12.22.\n\nNZ won the 2 test series 2\u20130. NZ had last beaten Pakistan in a series in 1985 \u2013 32 years ago. In between, NZ had lost 7 series and drawn 5.\n\n===88 v Bangladesh at Wellington 2016/17 ''NZ won by 7 wickets''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10680/scorecard/1019985/new-zealand-vs-bangladesh-1st-test-bangladesh-tour-of-new-zealand-2016-17/ Scorecard]\n\nIn the lead up to this rain-affected test, it was felt that the visiting Bangladesh side would be caught off-guard by the conditions, given their poor record outside of the subcontinent. However, after Williamson won the toss and sent Bangladesh in to bat on a green-looking surface, the New Zealand bowlers showed a general lack of discipline throughout the innings. Boult was particularly expensive, and struggled to find any sideways movement through the air or off the pitch. Despite losing nearly 50 overs on the first day to rain, Bangladesh managed to post a mammoth 595/8 in their first innings, with Boult (2/131), Southee (2/158) and Wagner (4/151) all conceding over 100 runs.\n\nNew Zealand fought back with the bat to reach 539. Many batsmen in the lineup made promising starts but failed to capitalise on the now batting-friendly wicket, with only Latham (177) being able to press on and make a large total. Latham's century was his sixth in Test cricket, the third-most by any New Zealand opener after John Wright (12) and Glenn Turner (7), and wrestled some of the initiative away from Bangladesh. Bowling all-rounder Santner also produced a career-best 73 to help reduce New Zealand's first innings deficit to 56. Having held the advantage for much of the Test, Bangladesh suddenly crumbled, being dismissed for only 160 seven overs before lunch on the final day. New Zealand's second innings bowling effort was an improvement on the first but much of Bangladesh's dismal showing could be attributed to a lack of application and poor shot selection from the batsmen. The Bangladeshi cause was also not helped when the captain Mushfiqur Rahim had to be stretchered off the ground, having received a sickening blow to the back of the head. New Zealand briskly chased down the 217 runs required for the loss of three wickets, with Williamson (104*) reaching his 15th Test century off just 89 deliveries - the fourth-fastest in the final innings of a test - and adding 163 for the third wicket with Taylor (60), their eighth hundred partnership in Tests.\n\nBangladesh's first innings total was the highest in a losing cause, and New Zealand's overall fourth innings run rate of 5.47 was the third-highest in Test history.\n\n===89 v Bangladesh at Christchurch 2016/17 ''NZ won by 9 wickets''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10680/scorecard/1019987/new-zealand-vs-bangladesh-2nd-test-bangladesh-tour-of-new-zealand-2016-17/ Scorecard]\n\nFor the second time in the series, Bangladesh imploded in the second innings after holding their own in the first, handing New Zealand a 9-wicket victory. Williamson once again called correctly and sent an injury-ravaged Bangladesh side in to bat. It looked to be a dubious decision after Bangladesh were sitting fairly comfortably at 165/2 after 35 overs. However, Southee (5/94) and Boult (4/87) were able to rally after breaking the third wicket partnership, eventually restricting Bangladesh to 289. The innings may well have been wrapped up even more swiftly had New Zealand held on to more of their catches, and Williamson's tactic of bombarding the lower order with short deliveries rather than bowling length and looking for swing may have further extended Bangladesh's innings. Southee's 5-wicket haul was his sixth in Test cricket.\n\nNew Zealand responded with an adequate, but not remarkable, total of 354. Middle order batsman Nicholls (98) fell just two runs short of a century, dragging a wide ball back onto his stumps. Latham (68) and Taylor (77) also made starts but gave away their wickets on a relatively placid Hagley Park surface. Useful contributions were also made by Santner (29) and Wagner (26), with the latter being run out in bizarre circumstances. Having charged back for a second run, Wagner crossed the crease at the bowler's end but did not ground his bat. As both feet were in the air at the time the bails were removed, the batsman was deemed not to have made his ground and was given as run out by the third umpire. This run out ended New Zealand's first innings, giving them a lead of 65.\n\nWith the situation in the Test relatively poised, Bangladesh was in a reasonable position to draw the match or even set up a moderately difficult chase given New Zealand had to bat last. By tea on the fourth day, however, they had been reduced to 100/5 - effectively 35/5 - and were able to register just 173 in total, with Boult (3/52), Southee (3/48) and Wagner (3/44) all among the wickets. New Zealand were able to chase down the 109 runs required with minimal incident, with Latham (41*) and the promoted de Grandhomme (33*) seeing them home that evening. The victory also sealed a 2-0 whitewash for the series, and continued a strong run at home for the Blackcaps.\n\n===90 v West Indies at Wellington 2017/18 ''NZ won by an innings and 67 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17952/scorecard/1115793/new-zealand-vs-west-indies-1st-test-wi-in-nz-2017-18/ Scorecard]\n\nThe visiting West Indies side came into this Test match off the back of a spectacular victory at Lord's, and confidence was high that they would provide some stiff opposition to the home side. In the end, they were beaten comprehensively despite being in a solid position for parts of the match.\n\nWilliamson won the toss and had no hesitation in sending the visitors in to bat on a pitch which looked as green as the turf surrounding it. However, within the first few overs it was apparent that there was little sideways movement on offer for either of the opening bowlers. Boult and Henry bowled relatively tidy spells but were unable to make breakthroughs on a surface which was offering little or no assistance in spite of its green appearance. The West Indies top order experienced little difficulty in the first session of the Test and moved the score on to 79/1 just before lunch. Sensing that the original plan was not working, the New Zealand skipper changed tack and opted to bring on Wagner, dropping back square leg and bringing a catching short-leg into place. The change in tactics had almost immediate effect; a devastating short-ball barrage from the left-armer ripped through the West Indies lineup to leave them dismissed for just 134 shortly before tea on the first day. Wagner ended up with career-best figures of 7/39 and his 5th 5 wicket haul in Test cricket.\n\nThe New Zealand innings began promisingly enough, with a 65-run opening stand between Latham (37) and Raval (42) and a solid fourth wicket partnership of 127 between Taylor (97) and Nicholls (67). However, after Taylor fell seven runs short of his century the middle order was dismissed in relatively quick succession, leaving the New Zealand innings stalling somewhat at 281/6. Debutant wicketkeeper-batsman Tom Blundell joined de Grandhomme (105) at the crease and the pair added 148 for the seventh wicket, the highest NZ seventh-wicket partnership against the West Indies. Blundell resumed his innings at the beginning of the 3rd day on 58*, with New Zealand 9 wickets down. Despite this, the No. 11 Boult was able to see Blundell (107*) through to his unbeaten maiden test century. It was the first time in Test history that a NZ wicketkeeper had made a hundred on debut. When Williamson eventually declared, New Zealand had made their way to 520/9 and were in a commanding position. An innings defeat seemed inevitable.\n\nHowever, the West Indies showed much more resistance in their second innings, and were able to play the short ball of Wagner much more effectively than in the first. Steady batting from the top order saw them through to 217/2 at the end of the third day, still 172 runs in arrears but in a decent position to avoid the innings defeat with Boult, Henry and Wagner struggling in the batting-friendly conditions. When Santner broke through to remove the opener Brathwaite for 91, the West Indies resistance began to crumble. The final 7 wickets fell for just 62 runs, leaving the West Indies 67 short of making New Zealand bat again.\n\n===91 v West Indies at Hamilton ''2017/18 NZ won by 240 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17952/scorecard/1115794/new-zealand-vs-west-indies-2nd-test-wi-in-nz-2017-18/ Scorecard]\n\nThe West Indies were dealt a blow before the match had even begun. In the wake of extremely slow over rates and late finishes during the first test, as well as similar offences in previous tours, the Windies skipper Jason Holder was handed a one match suspension by the ICC. For the first time in the series, West Indies won the toss and elected to field first on what appeared to be a fairly benign Seddon Park surface. The pitch indeed appeared to be offering little movement for the bowlers and New Zealand seemed to be cruising at 156/1. However, after Williamson (43) gloved a delivery down the legside to the keeper, the West Indies were able to make inroads into the middle order. Raval (84) was batting steadily but wickets continued to fall at the other end, and the Kiwis were now struggling somewhat at 189/5. A fast fifty from de Grandhomme (58) was able to wrest some initiative back towards New Zealand, but when he fell shortly before the close of the first day the batting effort looked destined for a middling score. The tail did not fall cheaply, however, and an excellent 10th-wicket stand of 61 between Southee (31) and Boult (37*) frustrated the West Indies bowlers, who eventually dismissed New Zealand for 373.\n\nThe West Indies' response struggled to find any momentum, and despite some resistance from the tail they were able to muster only 221 in their first innings. Boult (4/73) bowled well, but was given a fair deal of assistance by the West Indies batsmen, particularly Sunil Ambris. Ambris, who stood on his stumps for the second time in three innings, had been dismissed first ball in a similar fashion on debut. With the benefit of a 152-run lead the New Zealanders made a confident start to their second innings. Williamson (54) made his way to an effortless half-century before being undone by an inswinging yorker. However, New Zealand's middle order woes continued, and they were largely carried through to 291/8 thanks to Taylor's 17th Test century (107*). This effort drew him level with both Williamson and his former mentor, the late Martin Crowe, and Taylor was noticeably emotional after the innings.\n\nWest Indies never looked remotely in contention to chase down the 444 runs required at any point during their innings. Boult (2/52) and Southee (2/71) bowled well at the outset to remove the top order. Aggressive short-pitched bowling from Wagner (3/42) battered and bruised the middle order, and Santner (2/13) chimed in to remove the tail, granting New Zealand a comfortable 240 run win and another 2-0 home series whitewash. Ambris' misfortunes continued as he was forced to retire hurt with a broken arm after being struck by another bouncer from Wagner.\n\n===92 v England at Auckland 2017/18 ''NZ won by an innings and 49 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10883/scorecard/1115780/new-zealand-vs-england-1st-test-eng-tour-of-aus-and-nz-2017-18/ Scorecard]\n\nIn the first day/night pink ball test in NZ, Williamson won the toss and elected to bowl. Led by Trent Boult who took 6 for 32, NZ produced one of the best days of test cricket in NZ's history. Boult and Southee (4/25) bowling unchanged dismissed England for 58.\n\nBoult and Southee coaxed plenty of swing and movement out of the pink ball and at one stage had reduced England to 8 for 23. NZ fans were hoping England might be dismissed for less than the record 26. However England's number nine top scored with 33* and England were all out for 58.\n\nThis was their sixth-lowest total in any Test match. Their previous lowest total against New Zealand was 64 in Wellington in 1977-78.\n\nLooking to pressing home the advantage, NZ batted responsibly but slowly. Jeet Raval scored 3 off 23 balls, Tom Latham 26 off 112, Ross Taylor 20 off 35, Henry Nicholls 24* off 67 and Kane Williamson 91* off 177. At the end of Day 1 NZ had scored 175 for the loss of 3 wickets meaning they were 119 ahead on the first innings with 7 wickets left. Only 26 overs were possible on the second and third days of the test. Williamson scored his 18th test century (102). This was a record for NZ, Ross Taylor and Martin Crowe both scored 17 centuries. Day 4 was fine and Nicholls scored his second test century (145*) and NZ declared at 427 for 8.\n\nNZ's declaration halfway through day four gave them about 140 overs to bowl England out. At the end of Day 4, England were 132 for 3, and Boult had 2 of those. On Day 5 the pitch was still playing well and most of England's batsmen got a start. Wagner (3 for 77) bounced out 3 batsmen, Boult took 3 for 67, and Todd Astle playing in his third test took 3 for 39. Boult was named man of the match for his match figures of 9 for 99. This was the 50 test match at Eden Park.\n\nAt the conclusion of this test Williamson was ranked the number 3 batsmen in the world and Ross Taylor was 11th. Boult was ranked the 7th best bowler, Wagner 8th and Tim Southee was 16th.\n \nAndrew McGlashan writing on Circinfo stated that \"Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Neil Wagner have formed a formidable trio over the last four years. They first played together in 2013 and have joined forces in 24 Tests, of which New Zealand have won 13\". Collectively they have taken 316 wickets at an average of 25.84.\n\nWhile NZ was crushing England at Eden Park, Australia was tampering with the ball at Cape Town. The resulting furore dominated headlines in the cricket world for weeks, and led to Steve Smith and David Warner being banned from international and Australian domestic cricket for 12 months. Cameron Bancroft, who actually did the tampering was banned for 9 months and Australia's coach Darren Lehman resigned taking responsibility for the culture in the team.\n\nThe second test of a 2 match series was drawn so NZ recorded their first series win over England since 1999, and their first at home since 1983-84. NZ batted 124.4 overs in the fourth innings of the second test and lost 8 wickets for 256 but managed to secure the draw.\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10883/scorecard/1115781/new-zealand-vs-england-2nd-test-england-tour-of-australia-and-new-zealand-2017/ Scorecard ]\n\n===93 v Pakistan at Abu Dhabi 2018/19 (1st Test) ''NZ won by 4 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18879/scorecard/1157381/new-zealand-vs-pakistan-1st-test-nz-in-uae-2018-19 Scorecard]\n\nIn the U.A.E the recipe for winning starts with win the toss, bat first and post a big score. [[Kane Williamson]] won the toss, and he scored 63 but NZ was all out for 153, the lowest-ever first-innings total in Abu Dhabi. The last 5 wicket fells for 30 runs.\n\n[[Trent Boult]] bowled beautifully when Pakistan batted, he kept NZ in the game by dismissing four of the top six Pakistani batsmen. Boult took 4 for 54. Pakistan only lost four wickets getting past NZ first innings score but another lower order collapse kept NZ in the game. The last 5 wicket fells for 50 runs. Pakistan's 227 means a first innings lead of 74. [[Tim Southee]] was replaced for this game by 30-year-old, debutant left arm spinner [[Ajaz Patel]]. [[Colin de Grandhomme]] opened the bowling with Boult\n\nNZ lost only 1 wicket wiping of the deficit and four of the top six made decent contributions. [[Jeet Raval]] got 46, Williamson 37, [[Henry Nicholls (cricketer)|Henry Nicholls]] 55 and [[BJ Watling]] 55. At 220 for 4 NZ were back in the test match but then NZ lost 6 for 29 in the third lower order collapse of the test match. The last 5 wicket fells for 25 runs. NZ's total of 249 gave Pakistan a target of 176 to win.\n\nPakistan started strongly and were into the forties before the first wicket fell. Luckily for NZ, their two spinners, [[Ish Sodhi]] and Patel picked up 3 quick wickets. [[Azhar Ali]], batting at 3 steadied the ship and Pakistan got to 130 before losing their 4th wicket. 51 to win with 6 wickets left. After lunch on the fourth day [[Babar Azam]] lost his head and ran himself out - 147 for 5 - and the panic set in. The captain played an ambitious sweep shot for a man on 3 and was caught behind - 154 for 6. Panic became hysteria. The number 8 slogged across the line and was bowled by Patel - 154 for 7. The number 9 chased a wide ball from [[Neil Wagner]] and got caught at Slip - 155 for 8. The number 9 slog-swept against the turn and was caught on the midwicket boundary - 164 for 9.\n\nOnly when the ninth wicket fell did Pakistan follow [[George Hirst]]'s advice from 1902 -   \"We'll get 'em in singles\". While Azhar Ali was on strike Williamson put most of the fielders on the boundary, Azhar would turn down an easy singles until the last couple of balls of the over. This continued for seven tense overs, before Patel bowled a beautiful ball that pitched on the leg stump and spun past Azhar's bat to hit him on the thigh in front of the off bail.

Somerville made his first class debut for Otago in 2005 but played most of his 18 first class games for New South Wales.\n\nNZ won the toss and chose to bat first. They got off to a good start and were 70 for 1 at one stage but lost 3 quick wickets to the Pakistani spinners and ended up at 72 for 4. [[Kane Williamson]] and [[BJ Watling]] put on a 104 runs for the fifth wicket. After Williamson fell for 89 on Watling (77*) and the tail managed to score another 98 runs. However 274 batting first at Abu Dhabi was not a good first innings score.\n\nWhen Pakistan batted [[Trent Boult]] picked up 2 quick wickets but a fourth wicket partnership of 201 took Pakistan past NZ's first innings score. However the 2 NZ spinners [[Ajaz Patel]] and [[William Somerville (cricketer)|Will Somerville]] (4 for 75) dragged NZ back into the game. Nevertheless, NZ conceded a first innings lead of 74.\n\nThe NZ second inning started badly and at one stage NZ were 4 for 60, then Williamson and [[Henry Nicholls (cricketer)|Henry Nicholls]] put on 212 for the fifth wicket - a new record against Pakistan.\n\nThe run rate for the first 4 days had been a pedestrian 2.5 per over, but on the fifth day the test match leapt into life. At stumps on Day 4, NZ were 272 for 4 with Williamson on 139, Nicolls on 90 and NZ were 198 ahead of Pakistan. However overnight NZ had set their sight on victory. Williamson got out first ball of the day but Nicholls, de Grandhomme, and Southee sought quick runs and NZ scored 81 runs for the loss of 3 wickets in 9 overs. NZ declared at 353 for 7, Williamson top scored with 139 and Nicholls got 126*.\n\nPakistan's target was 280 off 79 overs. Southee and de Grandhomme picked up the first two wickets and then the spinners stepped up. Somerville got two wickets and Patel got one and at lunch on the fifth day, Pakistan were 55 for 5 and the game was over as a contest. Pakistan's last 5 wickets scored another 100 runs but the damage was too great to overcome. Southee took, 3 for 42, Patel 3 for 42 and Somerville on debut took 3 for 52 in the second innings and 7 for 127 in the match.\n\nThis victory over Pakistan gave the Black Caps their first away test series victory against Pakistan since the 1969. The victories in Abu Dhabi were split by a loss at Dubai.\n\nWilliamson scored 386 runs in 6 turns at bat at an average of 77.20. His career average at the end of the series was 51.56. Williamson's 228 runs in this test left him the second best ranked batsman in the world (913 pts) after [[Virat Kohli]] (920 pts).\n\n===95 v Sri Lanka at Christchurch 2018/19 ''NZ won by 423 runs''===\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18812/scorecard/1153839/new-zealand-vs-sri-lanka-2nd-test-sri-lanka-in-nz-2018-19 Scorecard]\n\nSri Lanka won the toss and put NZ in on a green wicket. After 27.1 overs NZ were 64 for 6. Then [[BJ Watling]] (49) was joined by [[Tim Southee]] (68) and they put on 108 for the 7th wicket and got NZ through to 178. The Sri Lankan bowlers tied to bounce Southee out but three top edges went for six and two others for four. His 68 came off 65 balls. NZ's last four wickets fell for 6 runs.\n\nSri Lanka began their reply on Day 1 and [[Tim Southee]] picked up 3 quick wickets and [[Colin de Grandhomme]] 1 wicket. At the end of Day 1 Sri Lanka were 88 for 4 and the match was still in the balance.\n\nBut in the morning session of Day 2 everything fell apart for the Sri Lankans. [[Trent Boult]] bowled 4 overs and 2 balls and dismissed 6 batsmen for 10 runs. Southee bowled 4 overs but got no further wickets. Boult swung the ball and bowled straight and the last 4 Sri Lanka batsmen were all plumb lbw. Southee finished the innings with 3 for 35 and Boult got his best innings figures of 6 for 30. Sri Lanka were all out for 104.\n\nIn NZ's second turn at bat all the top six made valuable contributions. [[Jeet Raval]] got 74, and [[Tom Latham (cricketer)|Tom Latham]] 176. Raval and Latham scored their first century partnership (121) together and made life very easy for the batsmen to follow. [[Kane Williamson]] got 48, and [[Ross Taylor]] 40. By the time [[Henry Nicholls (cricketer)|Henry Nicholls]] came to the crease NZ were 247 for 3 and Sri Lanka's target was already 321. Nicholls and Latham added 214 together. When Latham departed for 176 [[Colin de Grandhomme]], was promoted ahead of Watling, and scored NZ's fastest test 50 off 28 balls on his way to 71*. Nicholls (162*) and de Grandhomme added 124 runs at 8.55 runs an over.\n\nWilliamson declared at 585 for 4, leaving Sri Lanka to bat for about an hour and a quarter on Day 3 and all of Day 4 & 5 to save the match or score a world record 660 to win.\n\nIn Sri Lanka's second innings both Boult and Southee picked up an opener each in their first overs. Both openers chased wide balls they should have left and were caught by Watling and Sri Lanka were 24 for 2 at the end of day 3.\n\nSri Lanka fought hard on day four, seeing out the early swing and seam of Trent Boult and Tim Southee. As usual Wagner bowled rib ticklers and finally broke the 318-ball third wicket stand. In the evening session Wagner got 2 more wickets, one of which was with a throat-high bouncer. [[Angelo Mathews]] also pulled a ham string, retired hurt, and did not bat again. Sri Lanka did well to take the game into the fifth day and stumps were drawn with Sri Lanka at 231/6.\n\nNZ required just 14 balls on day 5 to finish of the Sri Lankan innings. Wagner bounced out one of those and Boult picked up the other 2 wickets. Boult took 3 for 77 and Wagner 4 for 48.\n\nBoult's match figures were 9 for 107, but Southee was the player of the match for rescuing NZ with the bat in the first innings with his top score of 68 and match figures of 5 for 96.\n\nThe victory was NZ'S largest victory in terms of runs.\n\nThis was a record fourth consecutive series win for New Zealand. NZ beat the West Indies and England at home last summer, and defeated Pakistan in the UAE in November 2018.\n\nAfter Sri Lanka unexpectedly beat South Africa in South Africa 2 nil, NZ moved to number 2 in the ICC test rankings behind India.\n\nThe four consecutive series victories were as a result of experienced and performing batsmen and pace bowlers and a decent spinner or two when the pitch was turning.\n\nThe career averages for the top seven regulars in the batting order at the end of this test were as follows:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!  !!Tests !!

Given that NZ had an experienced and talented team no one fancied the Bangladeshis chances of stopping another series victory.\n\nWilliamson won the toss and put the Bangladeshis in on a well grassed surface. However NZ bowled poorly and [[Tamim Iqbal]] flayed the new ball around Seddon Park. Bangladeshi were 121 for 1 at lunch. After lunch Wagner's short pitched bowling finally paid dividends, he took all five of his wicket with short balls. 5 for 47 was his sixth five-wicket haul in Tests. [[Tim Southee]] got 3 for 76. 234 all out was a very poor return on a good batting surface.\n\nNZ batted for 28 overs and by the end of Day 1 [[Jeet Raval]] and [[Tom Latham (cricketer)|Tom Latham]] had added 86 without loss. On Day 2, Ravel scored 132 and Latham 161. Their 1st wicket partnership of 254 was the third highest in NZ's Test history. NZ scored 365 runs on day 2 for the loss of only 4 wickets. Williamson was unbeaten on 93 at the close.\n\nOn Day 3, [[Neil Wagner]] batting at six, as a night watchman smashed 47 off 35 balls. [[Colin de Grandhomme]] smashed 76 of 53 balls. Williamson declared on 715 for 6 when he completed his double century.\n\nStatistical highlights were:\n\n*715 was NZ highest ever innings score\n*It was the 17th highest innings total of all time.\n*This was only the second time the top 3 batsmen for NZ had all scored centuries.\n*Ravel scored his maiden Test century\n*Wagner got his top score.\n*200* was Williamson's second double century\n*Williamson became the first NZer to score 20 Test centuries.\n*Williamson was the 16th fastest batsman ever to reach 6000 runs.\n*After this innings Williamson's test average was 53.20.\n\nThe declaration midway through Day 3 left Bangladesh 2 and a half days to bat. After an opening partnership of 88, Wagner ramped up the short balls, and the verbals. Bangladesh lost 4 wickets in 8 overs. They ended Day 3 on 174 for 4 chasing 481 to force NZ to bat again. The only mystery left in the game was how quickly they would be dismissed on Day 4.\n\nOn Day 4, the number 5 and 6 Bangladeshi batsmen combined in a partnership of 235. After 80 overs Bangladesh were 344 for 4. When Boult and Southee took the new ball they got some swing and 4 overs later Boult broke the partnership. None of the last 5 batsmen scored more than 4 runs and Bangladeshi finished with 429 of 103 overs. Boult got 5 for 123 and Southee 3 for 98. [[Todd Astle]] was the spinner for this match but failed to pick up a wicket.\n\n===97 v Bangladesh at Wellington 2018/19 ''NZ won by an innings and 12 runs''===\n\n[https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18805/scorecard/1153848/new-zealand-vs-bangladesh-2nd-test-bangladesh-in-nz-2018-19 Scorecard]\n\nThe first two days were ruined by rain and the Test did not start until the third day.\n\nWilliamson won the toss and not surprisingly chose to bowl on a pitch as green as the outfield. However, like in the first test, NZ bowled poorly and the Bangladeshi openers put on 75 for the first wicket. It wasn't until the 32nd over before [[Neil Wagner]]'s short pitched bowling started to pay dividends.   He dismissed the number 3, 4 and opening batsmen in 4 overs and Bangladesh were 134 for 4. Bangladesh struggled through to 206 before [[Trent Boult]] and [[Tim Southee]] picked up the last 4 wickets for 5 runs. Wagner finished with 4 for 28 and Boult 3 for 38.\n\nWhen NZ batted, there was still plenty of seam in the green pitch for accurate bowlers and NZ lost both their openers early.  [[Kane Williamson]] and [[Ross Taylor]] were forced to steady the ship after the openers were dismissed early. When the rain rolled in, NZ were 38 for 2, and Bangladesh still in the game.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day, Williamson and Taylor were troubled early but slowly wrestled control of the game away from Bangladesh. As there were only 2 days left in the game the NZ batsmen knew they had to score quickly. Williamson got 74 of 105 balls and he put on 180 with Taylor in 31 overs, at 5.55 runs an over. Nichols joined Taylor and scored 107 off 129 balls and they put on 216 in 40 overs at 5.4 runs an over.\n\nNichols century was his fifth and Taylor's 200 was his 18th century. Only Williamson with 20 has scored more for NZ. Williamson declared at 432 for 6 off 84.5 overs. (5.09 runs per over)\n\nThe declaration left Bangladesh 23 overs to bat before stump. Boult bowled one opener with the second ball of the innings and got the second opener in his 4th over. [[Matt Henry (cricketer)|Matt Henry]] bounced out a third batsman and Bangladesh were 80 for 3 at stumps and 141 in arrears.\n\nBangladesh got through 14 overs for the loss of only 1 wicket and then Wagner came on. The Bangladeshis had no answer to Wagner's unique bowling. Short pitch bowling at the batsman's ribs and throat got 4 out his 5 wickets and Bangladesh only managed 209 runs. Wagner got 5 for 45 and Boult 4 for 52. This was Wagner's 7th five-wicket haul in Test cricket and his match figures of 9 for 73 were a career best.\n\nThe third test of the series was called off following a terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch. Some of the Bangladeshi players were on the way to one of the mosques for Friday prayers when the attack began. The Australian terrorist murdered 51 people.\n\nBoth the batting and bowling averages of the 10 regular players over the 5 consecutive victorious Test series were outstanding.\n\nBatting Averages:\n{| class=wikitable\n!  !!Tests !!

Both tests were badly affected by monsoon rain but both ended in a result.\n\nThe ICC had just introduced the World Test Championship which allows a team to gain a maximum of 120 points per series. As this was a 2 test series each test victory was worth 60 points.  (Each test victory in a 5 match series is worth 24)\n\nThe monsoon rain reduced the three-day practice game to one day.\nNZ lost the first test in Galle bringing their five consecutive test series victory winning streak to an end.\nMonsoon rain and bad light reduced the 2nd test of the series to 275 overs (out of a possible 450).\n\nSri Lanka won the toss and chose to bat on greenish pitch.\nNZ did not pick Neil Wagner for this test but chose two spinners Will Somerville and Ajaz Patel.\nOnly 36 overs were possible on the first day and Boult and Southee did not get any wickets on day one. Sri Lanka finished at 84/2.\n\nOn Day 2, Boult got 2 wickets in the 41st over. The first of these was his 250 test wicket for NZ.\nSouthee got 2 wickets in the 57th over and Sri Lanka were 130 for 6. Then the rain washed out the rest of the days play after only 30 more overs.\n\nOn Day 3, Sri Lanka were still batting in their first innings. It took a further 23 overs for NZ to bowl them out for 244. Southee got 4 for 63.\n\nNZ started their first innings just before midday on day 3. \nAfter 43 overs they were 126 for 4. Then Latham (154) and Watling (109*) combined in a 143 run partnership for the fifth wicket.\nChasing quick runs de Grandhomme scored 83 of 69 balls and NZ ended Day 4 ahead by 138 runs.\n\nOn Day 5 NZ batted on for a very eventful 5 overs. In that time, de Grandhomme was out without adding to his overnight score, BJ Watling brought up his seventh test century and became NZ's highest-scoring wicketkeeper in Test cricket and Southee smashed 24 of 10 balls.\nSri Lanka had to survive most of day 5 to draw the game. They did not begin well and lost their first 5 wickets for 32 runs in 22 overs. Later Southee picked up his 250th test wicket for NZ as well.\n\nWhen the final session began, Sri Lanka still needed to bat out 36 overs to salvage a draw with three wickets in hand.\n26 overs later Sri Lanka had not lost a further wicket and the light was beginning to fade. Somerville finally got the breakthrough and then 4 overs later Patel got the penultimate wicket. 5 balls later at 4:44 pm Boult bounced out the last batsman and NZ squared the series and picked up 60 points in the World Test Championship table. 20 minutes later it was too dark to play.\n \nLatham was the player of the match for his 154 and Watling was awarded man of the series for scores of 1, 77 and 105*.\n\nIn the ICC cricket world cup, Williamson scored for 578 runs at 82.57 and was awarded the player of the tournament. In Sri Lanka a month later, Williamson only scored 24 runs in three turns at bat and was sent home to NZ for a rest and did not play in the limited over games.\nTwo months after the world cup final Williamson said \"Has it been a month has it? Feels like yesterday.\" and \"some members of his team are still trying to make sense of their heart-breaking World Cup final 'loss'.<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/black-caps/115762607/feels-like-yesterday-world-cup-final-loss-still-raw-for-kane-williamson</ref> By mid October the boundary count back rule that handed England the title of World Cup champion was abolished by the International Cricket Council.\n\n=== 99 v England at Mount Maunganui 2019/20 ''NZ won by an innings and 65 runs'' ===\nMount Maunganui hosted its first ever Test in the series opener against England. It was to be an auspicious debut.\n\nAfter winning the toss, England elected to bat first on what appeared to be a fairly lifeless wicket. The slow surface proved difficult for both batting and bowling, and old-fashioned attritional cricket became the order of the day. The New Zealand attack, while disciplined enough, were unable to make any decisive inroads into the English batting order on the first day. Despite the cheap dismissal of skipper Joe Root, the tourists finished at 241/4 at stumps on day 1, with NZ's World Cup nemesis Ben Stokes looking ominous on 67*. Several of the England top order batsmen got themselves set, including Joe Denly (79) and opener Rory Burns (52), but were unable to push on to truly big totals. When Stokes (91) fell the next day, courtesy of a blinder at slip from Ross Taylor, the lower order largely disintegrated and the innings lost its way. Only an attacking innings by wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler (43) and some stubborn resistance from well-known nightwatchman Jack Leach (18*) saw England drag themselves through to 353. Tim Southee registered the best bowling figures, taking 4 for 88. Neil Wagner also displayed his penchant for creating opportunities out of unhelpful conditions, and his aggressive short-pitched bowling yielded him 3 for 90. \n\nIt seemed to be a competitive score, and looked to be formidable when the New Zealand innings stalled at 127/4. New Zealand middle order veterans Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor appeared to be accumulating runs with relative ease, before Taylor (25) scooped a rank long hop to deep square leg. Williamson (51) fell victim to one of the few deliveries that did anything remotely unexpected, with a delivery from Sam Curran rearing up off a length and taking a glove through to the keeper. Henry Nicholls (41) played confidently, but when he fell with the score on 197, NZ were struggling and appeared destined for a sub-300 score. A lower-order rally, led by keeper BJ Watling, slowly but surely resuscitated the NZ first innings. Two crucial partnerships - 119 with Colin de Grandhomme (63) and a mammoth 261 with maiden centurion Mitchell Santner (126) - allowed the gritty keeper-batsman to help push the game out of England's reach. Watling himself made a career-best 205, a marathon innings lasting over 11 hours (667 minutes). By the time Williamson eventually declared on 615/9, with a lead of 262 runs, England had been kept out in the field for a whopping 201 overs.\n\nThe tourists were left with the unenviable task of batting out just under four sessions to save the match. By stumps on the fourth day, however, they had been reduced to 55/3 by some canny slow left-arm bowling from Santner, and looked unlikely to avoid an innings defeat. Resistance from Stokes and Denly on the final day left some New Zealand supporters wondering if their hopes of victory were to be denied at the last moment yet again. When Southee prompted Stokes to drag a wide delivery onto his stumps, midway through the last session, England lost their last hope of a draw. The way was cleared for Wagner, who proceeded to run through the relatively weak England tail. Wagner eventually picked up 5 for 44, and England had succumbed to defeat at 197 - 65 runs short of making NZ bat again. \n\nBroken records abounded in Mount Maunganui's inaugural Test. Watling's stirling double century made him the ninth wicketkeeper - and first for New Zealand - to achieve the feat. His partnership of 261 with Santner was also the highest in NZ Test history for the 7th wicket, and the team's first innings total of 615 was their highest against England.\n\nAt the end of this test the career batting averages for six of New Zealand's top seven batsmen averaged over 40. Kane Williamson 52.21, Ross Taylor 46.37, Henry Nicholls 44.16, Tom Latham 43.57, BJ Watling 40.51 and Colin de Grandhomme 40.33.\n\nThe career averages of New Zealand's pace bowlers were all under 30. Trent Boult 27.64, Tim Southee 29.89, Neil Wagner 27.04 and Colin de Grandhomme 29.63.\n\nWagner's 8 for 134 in the match propelled him to number 3 in the ICC Player ratings for bowlers.\n\nUnfortunately points for the series were not up for grabs in the World Test Championship.\n\n=== 100 v India at Wellington 2019/20 ''NZ won by 10 wickets'' ===\nThis was [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]'s 100th test victory. \n\nIndia went into this series ranked the number one test side in the world. New Zealand on the other hand had just finished a test series against Australia that they lost 3-0. The mauling in Australia led to the end of Jeet Raval's test career and Mitchel Santner dropped as NZ's spinner.

The New Zealand cricket team played its first Test in January 1930 against England in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand. The team won their first Test match 45 matches and 26 years later, against the West Indies at [[Eden Park]], Auckland, in the 1955/56 season. As of 19 March 2020, NZ has played 442 Test matches, '''won 101''', lost 175, while 166 matches ended as a draw.\n\n==1930 to 1945==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Played 14\n| '''WON 0'''\n| Lost 5\n| Drew 9\n|-\n|}\n\nThe [[New Zealand cricket team]]'s inaugural Test match was played on 10\u201312 January 1930 against England in Christchurch. The team contained two of NZ's finest ever batsmen, [[Stewie Dempster]] and [[Roger Blunt]] but the match was lost.\n\n==1945/46 to 1955==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Played 19\n| '''WON 0'''\n| Lost 10\n| Drew 9\n|-\n|}\n\nIn 1949 NZ sent one of its best ever sides to England. It contained [[Bert Sutcliffe]], [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]], [[John Richard Reid|John Reid]] and [[Jack Cowie]]. These four players consistently appear in NZ Test \"dream teams\". However, three-day Test matches ensured that all four Tests were drawn. Donnelly and Cowie retired after the 1949 tour. Despite playing 42 Tests for NZ, Sutcliffe never played in a victory. He missed the last two Tests of West Indies' tour in 1955\u201356, when New Zealand won their maiden Test victory in Auckland. Sutcliffe also missed the tour of South Africa in 1961\u201362, which New Zealand drew 2\u20132.\n\n==1955/56 to 1965==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Played 43\n| '''WON 3'''\n| Lost 23\n| Drew 17\n|-\n|}\n\n===1 v West Indies at Auckland 1955/56 ''NZ won by 190 runs''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1950S/1955-56/WI_IN_NZ/WI_NZ_T4_09-13MAR1956.html|title=4th Test: New Zealand v West Indies at Auckland, Mar 9\u201313, 1956 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nThe New Zealand cricket team achieved their first Test win 45 matches and 26 years after their first Test in 1930. Neither their form in the preceding season, when they were bowled out for the world record low Test score of 26 by England, nor their form in the three matches prior to this one suggested NZ's first Test victory was near at hand. The West Indies thrashed NZ in the first three matches of the four-match series by an innings and 71 runs, an innings and 64 runs, and 9 wickets respectively.\n\nIn the end, the victory over the West Indies was as comprehensive as the three previous losses had been. NZ outplayed the West Indies from start to finish. [[John Richard Reid|John Reid]], one of NZ's greatest cricketers, top scored for the match with 84 in the NZ first innings. [[Tony MacGibbon]] took 4 for 44 and [[Harry Cave]] 4 for 22 in the West Indies first innings of 145. The West Indies did even worse in their second bat, getting only 77, Cave again taking four wickets, 4 for 21.\n\nAs news of the tumbling West Indian wickets spread on the last afternoon of the match, Aucklanders began to flood into Eden Park to witness NZ's historic victory.

In NZ's second innings [[Graham Dowling]] (78) and Reid (69) top scored and South Africa had to chase 314 to win.\n\nReid (45 overs 4 for 44) ripped out the middle of the South African line up and left them reeling at 193 for 7. The last 3 South Africans wickets put on 83 and gave their side a chance of a draw, but [[Frank Cameron|Cameron]] took the last wicket 21 minutes from the close of play on the final day to win the test and draw the series.\n\nNZ did not win two tests in a series again until 1982/83 against an inexperienced Sri Lankan side in their first year of test cricket.

The target to win was only 88, but [[Bevan Congdon]] finished on 61 not out.\n\nThe Indians objected to Bartlett's bowling action but he was not called for throwing. India's opening bowler [[Syed Abid Ali|Abid Ali]], was however when he deliberately threw one delivery in protest, in NZ's second innings. Bartlett, one of the fastest bowlers to come out of NZ, played in the last 2 tests of the series, but never played test cricket again and retired from first class cricket aged 30.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/newzealand/content/player/36288.html|title=Gary Bartlett|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> NZ lost the series 3\u20131.\n\n[[Jack Alabaster]] took the first two wickets in India's second innings.

The West Indies collapsed in their second innings, scoring only 148 with [[Bob Cunis]] taking 3 for 35 and [[Bryan Yuile]] 3 for 26. NZ had little difficulty making 166 to win the match.

The Indian series was drawn 1\u20131. NZ won the series against the Pakistanis 1\u20130. This was their first ever test series win. The tour was hard going for the NZers. They stayed at the grounds and not in hotels, the tests in India were played during the monsoons and the players were paid a pittance. Therefore, two test wins, one drawn series and their first series win must be considered a very good outcome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/india/content/story/132552.html|title=Much more than cricket|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eap.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1960S/1969-70/NZ_IN_IND/NZ_IND_T2_03-08OCT1969.html|title=2nd Test: India v New Zealand at Nagpur, Oct 3\u20138, 1969 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nAlthough the pitch took spin from the morning of day one the top four gave NZ a good start to their first innings, [[Graham Dowling]] got 69, [[Mark Burgess (cricketer)|Mark Burgess]] 89 and NZ got past 200 with only 3 down. The eventually first innings total of 319 was not high but it was good enough to give NZ a first innings lead of 62. Spinner [[Hedley Howarth]] bowled well in the boiling heat and took 4\u201366. Part-time spinner, Burgess also picked up 3 wickets.\n\nNZ struggled against the spin in the second innings and at 171 for 9 India were still in the game, but [[Dayle Hadlee]] and Howarth added 43 for the last wicket and India had to chase 277. Spinners, Howarth (5\u201334)and [[Vic Pollard]] (3\u201321) bowled splendidly and India were bundled out for 109.\n\nNZ were well on top in the third test (NZ 181 & 175\u20138 Dec and India 89 & 76\u20137), but rain and a deliberate go-slow by match officials in getting the ground ready to resume play thwarted NZ's efforts to take the series.

On a pitch that offered only a little turn the NZ spinners [[Hedley Howarth]] (3\u201334) and [[Vic Pollard]] (3\u201327) dismissed Pakistan for only 114. [[Bruce Murray (cricketer)|Bruce Murray]] 90 and [[Brian Hastings]] 80* put on 101 for the third wicket and at one stage NZ were 48 ahead with only 2 wickets down.

Australia ignored NZ for 28 years after that claiming that NZ were not good enough to play them. NZ lost a 3 match series in Australia, 3\u20130 in 1973/74 but later in the same summer drew a 3-match series in NZ 1\u20131.\n \nIt was in the second match of this series that NZ achieved its maiden Test win over Australia. [[Glenn Turner]] (101 and 110*) became the first New Zealander to get a century in each innings of a Test. Turner scored nearly half of NZ's runs in the match while no other NZ batsmen got over 50. Turner also held the second innings together as NZ threatened to collapse chasing 228 for victory. [[Richard Collinge]] and the Hadlee brothers, [[Richard Hadlee|Richard]] and [[Dayle Hadlee|Dayle]] dismissed Australia for 223 and 259 and gave NZ the chance to chase what appeared to be smallish total for victory. In the end though it required another heroic performance from Turner to secure the win. Australia won the third match to draw the series.\n\n==1975/76 to 1985==\n\nThere were two main reasons for NZ's improved test record in this decade. The first was that Sri Lanka were newly granted test status at this time \u2013 NZ picked up 4 victories in Sri Lanka's first few years in test cricket, when they were a relatively weak and inexperienced side. The second reason was that NZ had the services of its best ever bowler, [[Richard Hadlee]] who made his debut in 1973. Hadlee played in all 13 of the victories in this decade and took 93 wickets at an average of 12.27 in those 13 matches.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Played 54\n| '''WON 13'''\n| Lost 21\n| Drew 20\n|-\n|}\n\n===9 v India at Wellington 1975/76 ''NZ won by an innings and 33 runs''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1970S/1975-76/IND_IN_NZ/IND_NZ_T3_13-17FEB1976.html|title=3rd Test: New Zealand v India at Wellington, Feb 13\u201317, 1976 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nNew Zealand achieved their first test victory by an innings. India won the toss and chose to bat against NZ's four pronged pace attack. The pitch was easy paced and the Indian openers started well but soon after mid-day [[Richard Hadlee]] dismissed the top 3 in 15 balls. His brother Dayle got another. The middle order recovered somewhat and India posted 220 with [[Richard Hadlee]] taking 4\u201335.\n\nCaptain [[Glenn Turner]] 64, [[Bevan Congdon]] 52, got NZ off to a good start and [[Mark Burgess (cricketer)|Mark Burgess]] 95, [[Lance Cairns]] 47 and the tail gave NZ a 114 first innings run lead. India's opener [[Sunil Gavaskar]] was hit in the cheek while fielding, ended up in hospital and took no further part in the game.\n\nOn the fourth day the Indians struggled against the NZ bowlers especially [[Richard Hadlee]] who bowled with pace and accuracy and went to lunch at 62 for 3. After lunch [[Richard Hadlee]] was irresistible and in 28 balls took 5\u201310 to finish with 7 for 23. His match figures of 11\u201358 was a new record for NZ and only the second time a NZ bowler had taken 10 wickets in a match. [[Jack Cowie]] took 10\u2013140 v England in 1937.\n\nThe 3 match series was drawn 1 all.\n\n[[Glenn Turner]] played in 7 more tests after this one before disputes with the NZ Cricket board kept him out of test cricket for 6 years. He then played in 2 victorious tests against Sri Lanka in 1982\u201383 before retiring aged 35.\n\n===10 v England at Wellington 1977/78 ''NZ won by 72 runs''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1970S/1977-78/ENG_IN_NZ/ENG_NZ_T1_10-15FEB1978.html|title=1st Test: New Zealand v England at Wellington, Feb 10\u201315, 1978 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nIt took NZ 48 tests and as many years to beat England for the first time. When England were set only 137 to win it seemed highly likely that England's unbeaten run would continue. However, when [[Richard Collinge]] bowled [[Geoff Boycott|Boycott]] with a fast inswinger the NZ players sensed an upset. [[Richard Hadlee]] and Collinge bowling virtually unchanged, poured on the pressure and dismissed the English for 64. Collinge (3 for 35) knocked the top off the order and Hadlee (6 for 26) cleaned up the middle and the tail. Hadlee's match figures were 10 for 100 and Collinge's were 6 for 77. The crowd, realising the historical importance of this victory, cheered the fall of each wicket with the same enthusiasm as those present at NZ's first test victory over 20 years beforehand.\n\nIn NZ's first innings [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]] took nearly 6 hours to make 55 on his test debut. In a low scoring game his score was only bettered by Boycott who took 7 and a half hours to make 77. The English won the second test and the 3-match series was drawn 1\u20131.\n\n===11 v West Indies at Dunedin 1979/80 ''NZ won by 1 wicket''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eap.cricinfo.com/link_to_database/ARCHIVE/1970S/1979-80/WI_IN_NZ/WI_NZ_T1_08-13FEB1980.html|title=1st Test: New Zealand v West Indies at Dunedin, Feb 8\u201313, 1980 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nIn one of the most acrimonious series of all time NZ achieved their first series win against the West Indies. The West Indies had recently beaten Australia 2\u20130 in a hard tour and arrived in NZ expecting to thrash the locals. As the West Indies had a side full of great players most of the NZ public expected much the same. Unfortunately for the West Indies they ran into [[Richard Hadlee]], some questionable umpiring and their own petulance, finally leaving NZ with a series loss and their reputations as sportsmen in tatters.\n\nIn the West Indies first innings of 140, Hadlee took 5 for 34 with 4 lbws. Although the pitch was keeping low, Don Cameron, a NZ cricket journalist, described the umpiring as \"indifferent\". NZ replied with 249, [[Bruce Edgar]] got 65 and Hadlee a quick 51. When umpire John Hastie gave [[John Parker (cricketer, born 1951)|John Parker]] not out [[Michael Holding]] kicked down the stumps. Parker later went on to score zero. The resulting photo is one of the most famous cricketing photos<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-aus.cricinfo.com/columns/content/story/241985.html|title=Ding-dong in Dunedin|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref> The West Indies scored 212 in their second bat and Hadlee got 6 for 68 with 3 more lbws. At the time, 12 lbws in the test were a new record. This was the first instance of a NZ player scoring 50 and taking 10 wickets in the same test. NZ needed only 104 to win but lost nine wickets getting to 100. The winning run was a leg bye.\n\nThe second and third tests were drawn but marred by more poor umpiring and some shocking behaviour from the West Indies. Among the lowlights from the second test were:\n*The West Indies refused to take the field after tea on the third day. Play finally resumed 12 minutes late.\n*The West Indies players spent the final session of the third day accidentally-on-purpose conceding boundaries and dropping catches.\n*After play ended on the third day the West Indies players voted to go home and held a party at their hotel to celebrate.

Despite movement for the bowlers, NZ finished the first day at 241 for 4. A patient unbeaten 137 over nearly six hours by captain [[Geoff Howarth]] got NZ to 375. Howarth's innings was the decisive factor in the match, the rest of which was dominated by the bowlers.\n\n[[Lance Cairns]] swung the ball late, and made deep inroads into the Indian batting by the end of the second day. The next day [[Gary Troup]] helped Cairns press home the advantage. Cairns took 5 for 33 and Troup 3 for 43. India were all out for 220.\n\nIn their second bat, NZ were bowled out for 100, [[Bruce Edgar]] top scoring with 28. India had two full days to get 253 but were soon floundering. At lunch they were 75 for 4. [[Richard Hadlee]] made up for his wicketless first innings by taking 4 for 65. India were all out for 190 and NZ won with a day to spare.

Australia regained some ground by having NZ struggling at 35\u20132 at the end of the first day, but on the second [[Bruce Edgar]] batted with certainty \u2013 his innings of 161 lasted more than eight and a half hours in all; because of intervals and stoppages for bad light he had to start and restart nine times. An aggressive Howarth (56) helped him add 87 for the third wicket and [[Jeremy Coney]] (73) 154 for the fourth wicket. Edgar was seventh out and runs from the tail gave NZ a 177 run first innings lead. Nineteen-year-old [[Martin Crowe]], playing in his second test match, scored 2.\n\nWith nothing in the pitch for the faster bowlers, Australia reached 167 before losing their second wicket and at the end of the fourth day Australia were 64 ahead on 241\u20134. On the final morning, [[Richard Hadlee]] got [[Greg Chappell]] first ball. This so inspired the NZ team that the Australian were all out for 280, Hadlee taking 5\u201363, leaving NZ only 104 to win.

Sri Lanka won the toss and invited the New Zealanders to bat. New Zealand started well enough with [[Glenn Turner]] making his return to Test cricket after six years. The opening partnership was worth 59 runs but NZ slumped to 93/4 and then later to 171/7. [[Jeremy Coney]] (84) and [[Warren Lees]] (89) added 79 for the eight wicket. Lees added 42 for the 9th wicket with [[Martin Snedden]] 52 for the 10th wicket with [[Ewen Chatfield]] NZ finally posted 344.\n\n[[Lance Cairns]] (4\u201349) and [[Richard Hadlee]] (4\u201333) were too good for Sri Lanka and they were dismissed for 144, failing by only 1 run to save the follow-on. Their second innings was hardly happier, all out for 175. [[Martin Snedden]] took 3\u201348 [[Lance Cairns]] 4\u201347 and [[Ewen Chatfield]] 3\u201340.\n\nThis was New Zealand's first test victory inside three days and only the second time they had won by an innings. [[Glenn Turner]] played 39 test matches for New Zealand between February 1969 and February 1977. A falling out with the NZ cricket authorities lead to Turner not playing for New Zealand for six years. He played two more test matches against Sri Lanka in March 1983, both of which NZ won.\n\n===15 v Sri Lanka at Wellington 1982/83 ''NZ won by 6 wickets''===\n\nThe second test of the inaugural series between Sri Lanka and New Zealand was marred by rain. Although play took place on each of the five days, the match itself lasted little more than eighteen hours. Sent in to bat on a seam-friendly pitch, Sri Lanka slumped to 48/4 by the second morning but were revived by a great stand of 130 for the fifth wicket between [[Ranjan Madugalle]] and [[Somachandra de Silva]] and eventually reached 240, with [[Ewen Chatfield]] taking 4 for 66. New Zealand also struggled in their first innings and looked to be flagging at 169/9, but Sri Lanka's lacklustre fielding allowed New Zealand to pass the 200 mark. Hadlee, who was dropped on 0, struck a quickfire 30 and Cairns, who was also missed before scoring, made a brisk 45 and added 32 for the last wicket with Chatfield, reducing New Zealand's first innings deficit to 39. [[John Wright (cricketer)|John Wright]] had his nose broken by a bouncer but returned to add an additional four runs, taking his total run aggregate past 1000. Sri Lanka then collapsed to 93 in their second innings with wicketkeeper [[Warren Lees]] taking five catches. New Zealand knocked off the 133 runs they needed with 6 wickets to spare, reaching the target 48 minutes before lunch with a six from Hadlee.\n\n===16 v England at Leeds 1983 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\nNew Zealand finally won a Test in England after 17 defeats and 11 draws, overcoming a hostile spell from Bob Willis to secure a five-wicket triumph on the fourth day. It also ended a 16-year drought for an overseas victory and, amazingly, didn't include a wicket from Richard Hadlee, although he deserved much better. Lance Cairns was the hero with ten wickets in the match and seven in the first innings in helpful conditions. England were well placed on 175 for 3 before they lost 7 for 50. John Wright (93) and Bruce Edgar (84) then played key roles in engineering a 152-run win. Edgar had to retire hurt after being hit on the thigh by Ian Botham, but returned to add 84 with Hadlee, who scored a vital 75. Ewen Chatfield bagged five in the second innings. Only David Gower's 112 provided much resistance. The target caused a few wobbles, but Jeremy Coney held his nerve. He later said: \"The main feeling was thinking of all the New Zealand players who have been coming here for 52 years, better players than myself, and making sure that their sweat and effort had not been in vain.\" England hit back to take the final two Tests and claim the four-match series 3\u20131.<ref name=\"content-nz.cricinfo.com\">{{cite web|url=http://content-nz.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/current/story/351022.html|title=Overjoyed overseas|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===17 v England at Christchurch 1983/84 ''NZ won by an innings and 132 runs''===\n\nThe second match of the series saw New Zealand outplay their opponents in just about every facet of the game. A shambolic performance from England, including a bowling effort later described by [[Bob Willis]] as some of the worst bowling he had ever seen in Test cricket, allowed NZ to achieve their largest victory at the time in little over twelve hours of play.\n\nAided by some wayward bowling, NZ posted 307 in their first innings, at what was then considered a fairly brisk rate of 4.2 runs per over. Richard Hadlee, coming in with the innings in the balance, struck 99 off 81 balls, taking full toll of a surplus of long hops and half volleys from the tiring England bowlers. Taking advantage of a suspect surface, the NZ bowlers proceeded to run through the England batting lineup on the rain-affected second day. England were promptly dismissed for 83 in their first innings, with Hadlee, Cairns and Chatfield taking 3 wickets apiece. After being forced to follow on, England were reduced to 33/6 and some wondered if they would be able to surpass their lowest score against NZ in a Test (64). Although they managed to, thanks to a 39-run partnership between Derek Randall and Bob Taylor, England were eventually dismissed for 93, handing NZ victory by an innings and 132 runs. Hadlee's bowling figures of 8/44 for the match, along with his 99 in the first innings, made him the dominant figure of the match.<ref>{{cite web|title=NEW ZEALAND v ENGLAND 1983\u201384|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152309.html|website=Cricinfo|accessdate=15 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===18 v Sri Lanka at Kandy 1983/84 ''NZ won by 165 runs''===\n\n===19 v Sri Lanka at Colombo 1983/84 ''NZ won by an innings and 61 runs''===\n\n===20 v Pakistan at Auckland 1984/85 ''NZ won by an innings and 99 runs''===\n\n===21 v Pakistan at Dunedin 1984/85 ''NZ won by 2 wickets''===\nThis was New Zealand's last series victory over Pakistan until November 2016.\n\n==1985/86 to 1995==\n[[Richard Hadlee]] played in all of the first 8 test victories of this decade, taking 73 wickets at an average of 13.53.

Of Hadlee's 86 Tests, New Zealand won 22 and lost 28. Hadlee missed 14 tests during his career and NZ didn't win a single one. By December 2007, of the 17 tests that Bond had played in, NZ had won 9 and lost only 2.

Hadlee's targeting of [[Andrew Hilditch]]'s weakness (he was a compulsive hooker) was particularly brilliant. Hilditch was caught off Hadlee's bowling at fine leg in both innings and never played for Australia again, although he did become an Australian selector.\n\nHadlee's haul was so extraordinary that it tends to over-shadow NZ excellent performance with the bat \u2013 NZ recorded their highest score against Australia. [[Martin Crowe]] (188), [[John Fulton Reid|John F. Reid]] (108) and Hadlee (54*) were the main contributors in NZ's 553/7 dec. Crowe and Reid's 3rd wicket partnership of 224 was at the time a new record for NZ.\n\nAustralia won the second test in Sydney but NZ won the third in Perth to take the series. Peter English said in 2007 that the series was all about Hadlee. \"He may not bowl at the same speed as the West Indian pace battery, but he is a master at his craft.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-eap.cricinfo.com/columns/content/current/story/324188.html|title=International man of mastery rocks the Gabba|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===23 v Australia at Perth 1985/86 ''NZ won by 6 wickets''===\n\nAnother match, another Hadlee masterclass. He picked up 11 wickets at the WACA to give New Zealand their first series win against Australia. He also finished the series with a remarkable 33 victims at 12.15, the best figures in a three-match Test tour since SF Barnes in 1912. New Zealand entered the match with the series at 1\u20131 \u2013 they were unfortunate to have lost the second Test, at the SCG, which could have gone either way. But their medium-fast seamers, who had laboured on hard and fast Australian pitches in the past, found themselves in 1985\u201386 bowling on surfaces more like those in their own country. It also meant sensible, straight-playing batsman could thrive. It was the perfect combination for New Zealand. Even the renovated WACA ground was not its usual lightning self, though the batsmen were not entirely comfortable, and when New Zealand were set 164 to win at roughly two an over, on a pitch that was breaking up, they were no certainty. But Crowe's unbeaten 42 got them there with six wickets and ten overs to spare.<ref name=\"content-nz.cricinfo.com\"/>\n\n===24 v Australia at Auckland 1985/86 ''NZ won by 8 wickets''===\n\n[[John Bracewell]] took 10 wickets in this match and helped them bowl Australia out for 103 in their second innings.\n\n===25 v England at Nottingham 1986 ''NZ won by 8 wickets''===\n\n===26 v West Indies at Christchurch 1986/87 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\n===27 v India at Bombay 1988/89 ''NZ won 136 runs''===\n\nHadlee claimed the world wicket-taking record in the first Test but New Zealand predictably lost. When they were 175 for 8 on the opening day of the second match in Mumbai the series was following the expected path. However, John Bracewell scraped together a battling 52 \u2013 his first crucial role in a match he would eventually win \u2013 to lift New Zealand to 236. Hadlee claimed 6 for 49 and as Wisden reported: \"[He] once again began to dictate terms: none of the remaining batsmen could keep him out as [Kris] Srikkanth had done at the start.\" India's last eight wickets went for 100 and they trailed by 2. Andrew Jones' 78 and Ian Smith's 54 set India 282 in 130 overs; they didn't get close. Srikkanth fell to Hadlee's first-ball incutter before Bracewell took over and removed Navjot Sidhu and Dilip Vengsarkar in his first two. There was no way back for India, who were never comfortable against Bracewell. \"Azharuddin's nervous start against Bracewell's old-fashioned, yet sharp, off-breaks told the whole tale of how India were being hoist with their own petard,\" Wisden said. \n<ref name=\"content-nz.cricinfo.com\"/>\n\n===28 v India at Christchurch 1989/90 ''NZ won by 10 wickets''===\n\nJohn Wright scored 185 in New Zealand's first innings of 459 while Sir Richard Hadlee took 400th test wicket on his home ground.\n\n===29 v Australia at Wellington 1989/90 ''NZ won by 9 wickets''===\n\n===30 v Zimbabwe at Harare 1992/93 ''NZ won by 177 runs''===\n\n===31 v Australia at Auckland 1992/93 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/current/match/63603.html|title=3rd Test: New Zealand v Australia at Auckland, Mar 12\u201316, 1993 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nAustralia spent most of this engrossing Test trying to wriggle their way out of trouble after a calamitous opening day. Indeed, they almost wriggled into a winning position, setting New Zealand a thorny target of 201 on a bowlers' pitch. That the home side made the runs with five wickets to spare, and without succumbing to the tension of the occasion, was a measure of their improvement through the series.\n\nBorder's decision to bat looked reasonable after an uneventful first hour, but then the clouds enclosed Eden Park and the game underwent a personality change. New Zealand had learned the lessons of Christchurch and dismissed Australia for 139 in conditions conducive to swing and seam bowling. Morrison's lethal fast out-swingers brought him six for 37. This included his 100th Test wicket when he had Healy caught in the gully \u2013 though Border, his 99th, was given out caught behind to a delivery that clipped his off stump without removing the bails, the first of several decisions from umpire King that upset the Australians. Morrison became the eighth New Zealander to pass the milestone, in his 29th Test. New Zealand also benefited from the influence of the canny Watson; Martyn, who had replaced Mark Waugh, did well to get an edge to a Watson leg-cutter.\n\nThe impression that Eden Park was a swing bowler's paradise was reinforced next day by Steve Waugh, whose potent out-swinger had Crowe caught at first slip attempting to turn the ball to leg. Unfortunately, that resulted in Border holding back Warne \u2013 other than a maiden before lunch \u2013 until the last hour of the day, when New Zealand led by 39. Once again Warne changed a game's direction, taking four wickets for eight from 15 overs. Collectively the New Zealand batsmen had struck their best form of the series, but had little to show for it: the top five reached 20, but none passed Rutherford's 43, which ended when he danced recklessly down the pitch to Warne's second delivery.\n\nIn a bid to swing the delicately balanced series, Crowe tossed the new ball to his off-spinner, Patel. Crowe spoke later of the eerie feeling this created in the opposition, and certainly Australia appeared slightly spooked: Taylor was stumped in Patel's first over and Langer lbw in his second, neither offering a shot. Martyn responded with an aristocratic 74, dropping down on one knee to slap the bowling about. Boon made only 29 of their 107-run partnership before Martyn fell to Greatbatch's acrobatic catch at silly mid-off. But it still took determined contributions from Border and Hughes to scrape together the lead of 200 Australia thought they needed.\n\nThe series reached a climax with the heavyweight clash between Hughes and the New Zealand opener Greatbatch, who came out swinging like cowboys in a bar-room brawl. Hughes was affronted by Greatbatch's tactic of charging the bowling and the pair exchanged heated words, brushed chests and Hughes once spat on the ground in Greatbatch's direction. Greatbatch's most extraordinary shot came at the expense of McDermott, whom he charged and deposited into the terraces over wide mid-off. His 29 from 30 balls ended when Hughes uprooted his middle stump, but he had broken the ice. While never dominating Warne, the New Zealand batsmen made a better fist of his bowling than at any other stage in the series, and won in something close to comfort. This would be New Zealand's last test win over [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] for over 18 years.\n\n===32 v Pakistan at Christchurch 1993/94 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nz.cricinfo.com/db/ARCHIVE/1993-94/PAK_IN_NZ/PAK_NZ_T3_24-28FEB1994.html|title=3rd Test: New Zealand v Pakistan at Christchurch, Feb 24\u201328, 1994 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nPakistan led by [[Saleem Malik]] and possessing two magnificent fast bowlers, [[Waqar Younis]] and [[Wasim Akram]], won the first two matches of the series and were widely expected to complete a clean sweep.\n\nAfter Pakistan's first innings of 344 ([[Danny Morrison (cricketer)|Danny Morrison]] 4\u2013105 & [[Simon Doull]] 3\u201393) Waqar Younis sliced through NZ's first innings in familiar fashion. Only [[Andrew Jones (cricketer, born 1959)|Andrew Jones]] (81) stood firm and NZ posted 200.  Thanks to some fine bowling [[Danny Morrison (cricketer)|Danny Morrison]] again (4\u201366) and [[Matthew Hart]] (3\u201347) Pakistan only got 179 in the third innings. Even so, NZ's target of 324 looked far too high. NZ had never scored more than 278 in the fourth innings for a test victory.\n\nAlthough they had more than 2 days to get them, at 133 for 4, with Jones gone, it did not look likely. But the 154-run stand between [[Bryan Young (cricketer)|Bryan Young]] (120) and [[Shane Thomson]] (120*) transformed the match and gave NZ an unlikely victory.\n\nIn late 1998, allegations were made at a Commission headed by Pakistan high court judge [[Malik Mohammad Qayyum]] into match fixing that some members of the Pakistan team had deliberately underperformed in matches on this tour. Salim Malik was subsequently banned from cricket for life (later overturned) and Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram were fined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/in_depth/2000/corruption_in_cricket/763483.stm|title=BBC SPORT  \u2013 Special Events \u2013 2000 \u2013 Corruption in Cricket  \u2013 The Malik affair: A timeline|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===33 v South Africa at Johannesburg 1994/95 ''NZ won by 137 runs''===\n\nNew Zealand marked their first tour of South Africa in 33 years with a victory that stunned the home side in Hansie Cronje's first Test as captain. It was a real team performance: Shane Thomson made 84, Crowe 83, Ken Rutherford 68, and there was a final wicket stand of 57, boosting them to above 400. Then Simon Doull took six wickets, and Matthew Hart five to wrap up the win. Dion Nash had South Africa in early trouble at 38 for 3, although Andrew Hudson's dismissal was shrouded in controversy: replays showed he'd walked for a catch that bounced. It needed Dave Richardson's 93 to avoid the follow-on but Fanie de Villiers brought South Africa back into the match as New Zealand fell to 34 for 5. Stubborn efforts from the lower order set South Africa a target of 327 on a wearing pitch. Hart's left-arm spin proved the trump card, helping to cover for the loss of Nash, who suffered a tour-ending side strain. The series, though, sank rapidly from these heights as New Zealand lost the final two Tests to become the first side since 1888 to lose a three-match series after going ahead. Three players \u2013 Hart, Nash and Stephen Fleming \u2013 were also suspended for smoking cannabis, and injuries hit the squad badly.<ref name=\"content-nz.cricinfo.com\"/>\n\n==1995/96 to 2005==\n\nThe reason for this was decade being NZ's most productive was the 8 victories recorded against weak opposition, namely Zimbabwe and newcomers Bangladesh. Zimbabwe was never a strong test side but they were severely weakened by the policies of their government. Bangladesh have won three tests since they were granted test status, one against Zimbabwe and two against the West Indies (their first overseas win and series victory), with both teams crippled by player strikes and inept administration. There were also 3 wins against the West Indies which had gone from the best side in the world to one of the weakest in little over a decade.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Played 85\n| '''WON 24'''\n| Lost 30\n| Drew 31\n|-\n|}\n\n===34 v Pakistan at Lahore 1996/97 ''NZ won by 44 runs''===\n\nThis was just New Zealand's second win in Pakistan and was inspired by an outstanding display of swing bowling from Doull. He claimed 8 for 85 in the match as New Zealand overcame an impressive debut century from Mohammad Wasim to secure a 44-run win on the fourth day. The opening stages of the match suggested anything but an away win, as Waqar Younis and Mushtaq Ahmed shared eight wickets to blow New Zealand apart for 155. But when their turn came, Pakistan slumped to 37 for 5 against Doull before hauling themselves to a seemingly vital 36-run lead. Chris Cairns turned the match as he came in at 101 for 5 and blasted 93 off 89 balls, while Fleming stood firm with an unbeaten 92. Chasing 276, Pakistan crashed to 60 for 6, and although Wasim resisted, he couldn't deny New Zealand. Cairns admitted it had been an emotional experience. \"I went up to Simon to congratulate him on an outstanding performance. I was quite close to tears.

Doull 5\u201358 and Davis 3\u201334 dismissed Sri Lanka for 222. Stephen Fleming enforced the follow on. Sri Lanka's 328 was an improvement on the first innings but was still a disappointment on an exceptionally good pitch. Doull took 3\u201382 giving him match figures of 8\u2013140. Doull took his third five wicket bag of the season, following those against Pakistan and England. He had given NZ the bowling edge but the man of the match award went to Young who had been on the pitch throughout.\n\nThis was New Zealand captain [[Stephen Fleming]]'s first test win as captain.\n\n===36 v Sri Lanka at Hamilton 1996/97 ''NZ won by 120 runs''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63751.html|title=2nd Test: New Zealand v Sri Lanka at Hamilton, Mar 14\u201317, 1997 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nTeenage left \u2013arm spinner [[Daniel Vettori]] took 9\u2013130 in his fourth test to give NZ their first series win since their visit to Zimbabwe in 1992/93.

The West Indies were 140 for 0 chasing 290 for victory when Gayle hit a 50-over old ball on to the roof of the stand. The replacement balls were all about 10 overs old. The umpire chose one and roughed it up on concrete to artificially age it. The umpire roughed up one side more than other and the ball started to reverse swing.

For the West Indies on the other hand, this was their eighth consecutive loss, their worst losing streak in history.

He and Kumar Sangakkara had been engaged in a tense battle for survival in a low-scoring contest, and had added 27 vital runs for the tenth wicket when Sangakkara clipped Shane Bond down to fine leg to bring up an excellent century. Murali tapped his bat into his crease to complete the run, then turned at once to congratulate his partner. At the same instant, the return throw came in from the boundary, and McCullum didn't think twice about breaking the wicket and putting in his appeal. The ball was not dead, so it was a justifiable move (if not entirely in the spirit of the game), and when New Zealand lost five wickets in pursuit of 119 for victory, it assumed even greater importance in hindsight.

NZ finished with 393, a 250 run first innings lead.\n\nAnother poor performance with the bat followed and Bangladesh were all out for 113 before lunch on the third day.

[[Paul Collingwood]] took over an hour to score 2 runs but after he was bowled by Vettori the English tail offered little resistance and NZ won with a session to spare on Day 5.\n\nNZ's four most inexperienced players, How (7 matches), Taylor (3), [[Jeetan Patel]] (2) and Mills (10) made big contributions to this victory. How and Taylor got their highest test scores 92 and 120, respectively and Patel and Mills their best bowling figures 3/107 and 4/16, respectively.\n\nThis was also [[Stephen Fleming]]'s last series for NZ and he finished the series with 111 matches, 7172 career runs, and 171 career catches, all records for NZ.\n\nNZ lost the next 2 tests and as a result lost the series 2\u20131.

He scored 55* & 76 and took 5\u201359 & 4\u201374.  Without Vettori's contribution Bangladesh would have achieved their first test win against decent opposition (i.e. not Zimbabwe). As it was Bangladesh were ahead for the first 3 and a half days of the test and NZ only won by 3 wickets.\n\nBangladesh batted first and despite being 4\u201344 managed to get to 245. In addition to Vettori's 5\u201359, [[Iain O'Brien]] also bowled very well for 3\u201336. NZ replied with what Dylan Cleaver writing in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''described as:\n<blockquote>\n\"the nadir, rock bottom, ground zero of batting efforts during the Bracewell era; all against a spin bowling attack that did nothing but put the ball in the right place most of the time\".\n</blockquote> Vettori batting at eight, top scored with 55* out of 171.\n \nBangladesh's second bat was a repeat of the first; 4\u201349 then recovering to 242, Vettori took 4\u201374.\n\nNZ were left with a target of 317 to win. NZ's top 3 all managed decent contributions this time around but when number 3, [[Jesse Ryder]] (38) fell at 145 just before stumps on the fourth day, Vettori either sent himself in as nightwatchman, or promoted himself to number 4 because he didn't have faith in middle order. Publicly, it is the former, but many suspect the latter.  Vettori added 40 with opener [[Aaron Redmond]] (79) and 82 with [[Daniel Flynn (cricketer)|Daniel Flynn]] (49).  When Vettori finally fell at 298 he had scored 27% of NZ runs, had dismissed 45% of the Bangladeshis, and had saved NZ from an embarrassing defeat.\n\nNZ's target of 317 was the second highest score NZ had chased to win a test. The highest score of 324/5 is against Pakistan, on a tour which included an ODI that Pakistan deliberately underperformed in.\n\n=== 67 v Pakistan at Dunedin 2009/10 ''NZ won by 32 runs'' ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/nzvpak2009/engine/match/423778.html|title=1st Test: New Zealand v Pakistan at Dunedin, Nov 24\u201328, 2009 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\n[[Shane Bond]] played his first test for 2 years and won the test for NZ with match figures of 8\u2013153.

Despite being 34 years old, Bond bowled as fast as ever and with a devastating second spell reduced Pakistan to 85\u20135. Pakistan eventually recovered to 332 and Bond finished with 5\u2013107.\n\nAlthough Ross Taylor got another fifty, (59) inept batting from NZ in the second innings saw them all out for 153, leaving Pakitan a target of just 251. However, NZ's bowling attack of Bond, [[Chris Martin (cricketer)|Chris Martin]], [[Iain O'Brien]] and Vettori bowled well enough to make up for the brainless batting of the NZ batsmen in the second innings. Pakistan were all out for 219. Bond took 3\u201346.\n\nBond however bowled 48.5 overs in the match, suffered an injury, and was invalided out of the rest of the series. He later retired from test cricket. Bond's contribution to the test side was immense. Of the 18 tests that he played in NZ won 10.\n\nNZ lost the second test of the series and the third was drawn.

Guptill added 56* to his first innings score. [[Tim McIntosh]] got 89 and [[Ross Taylor]] 51.\n\nNZ bowled better than in the first innings, but not by much, and Bangladesh were dismissed for 282.\n\nDespite the victory the NZ cricket team received scant praise from the NZ press. [[Mark Richardson (cricketer)|Mark Richardson]] writing in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''was typical:\n\n<blockquote>\nWe aren't totally happy, which is a rarity after a Black Caps test victory.

Australia were still well in control at 159\u20132 then Bracewell changed the game in 2 overs dismissing Ponting (16), Clarke (0) and Hussey (0) and suddenly Australia were looking vulnerable at 159\u20135. Warner and Haddin added 33 valuable runs but then [[Tim Southee]] grabbed 2 wickets in the 54th over. Bracewell took another 2 wickets in the 55th over and Australia were reeling at 199\u20139.

The entire match was completed in just over two days of playing time.\n\nNew Zealand was put in to bat by Zimbabwe and scored 495/7 declared. [[Martin Guptill]] (51) and [[Brendon McCullum]] (83) laid the foundation with an opening partnership of 124. [[Ross Taylor]] scored 122 before retiring hurt and [[BJ Watling]], playing as the wicket keeper for the first time, scored his first century for New Zealand.  NZ declared soon after Watling reached his hundred.\nOnly 15 overs were possible on the second day of the match but the weather was perfect for day 3.  NZ used the first 18 overs of the day to add another 103 runs and then the same four pace bowlers that ran through Australia in Hobart two months before, bowled Zimbabwe out twice in the same the day.\n\n[[Chris Martin (cricketer)|Chris Martin]], [[Trent Boult]], [[Doug Bracewell]] and [[Tim Southee]] all took 2 wickets in Zimbabwe's first innings of 51. This was the lowest scored NZ had ever bowled a test team out for.\n \nZimbabwe followed on and fared a little better, all out for 143. Martin's 6\u201326 in the innings was his best performance in first class cricket, and was the 10th best bowling performance for NZ. He was named man-of-the match. Martin also moved into third place on the [[List of Test cricket records for New Zealand#Player records|most-wickets-for-New Zealand list]], behind [[Richard Hadlee]] and [[Daniel Vettori]] and tied with [[Chris Cairns]].\n\nZimbabwe did not play test cricket from September 2005 to August 2011.

Instead NZ went into this match having lost five tests in a row. It was New Zealand's first Test win in Sri Lanka since 1998.\n\nNZ won the toss and batted but soon found themselves in the familiar situation of being two down for not very many. However, [[Kane Williamson]] (135) and [[Ross Taylor]] (142) put on 262 \u2013 NZ's sixth highest partnership. [[Daniel Flynn (cricketer)|Daniel Flynn]] (53) and the tail provided some more runs and NZ finished with 412. Williamson's 135 was his highest score.\n\n[[Tim Southee]], swinging the new ball beautifully, led the attack and Sri Lanka were 12\u20133 and then 105\u20135. Southee snared 4 of the first 5 wickets to fall. As the ball aged the Sri Lankans found batting easier but when Southee and [[Trent Boult]] got hold of the second new ball they lost their last 4 wickets for 19 runs. Southee finished with 5\u201362 and Boult with 4\u201342. This was Boult's best bowling in an innings.\n\nNZ had a 168 run first-innings lead but a collapse to 75\u20135 in their second innings set kiwi supporter's hearts a flutter, but then Taylor (74) and [[Todd Astle]] (35), on his debut put on 97 runs. NZ declared at 194/9 setting Sri Lanka 363 runs to win.\n\nSouthee and [[Doug Bracewell]] reduced Sri Lanka to 47\u20134 at stumps on the fourth day. Sri Lanka's second top order failure of the match left them with only one option \u2013 to play for a draw. They limped through to 168/7 before Taylor took the second new ball and Boult and Southee cleaned up the tail in six overs. Sri Lanka were all out for 195.\n\nTaylor scored 216 runs in the match and Williamson 153. Both Southee (8\u2013120) and Boult (7\u201375) got their best bowling figures in a match. David Leggat writing in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''said:\n\n<blockquote>\nSouthee, since returning after missing the first test in India in August, has taken 20 wickets in three tests, including a career-best seven for 64 at Bangalore. He is now the country's leading fast-medium bowler... Boult has found his feet at the top level and the ability to bring the ball in late to the righthanders and slide it across makes him a genuine threat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=10851213|title=Cricket: Consistency's the next big test|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nTaylor was ranked the 8th best batsmen in the world after this match. McCullum was the NZ's next highest ranked batsman at 27th.\n\nSoon after Taylor's match winning performance he was sacked as captain by NZ Cricket. It later emerged that coach [[Mike Hesson]] told Taylor that he was going to recommend that Taylor be replaced as captain before the Sri Lankan series had even begun. After his performance in the second test NZ Cricket offered Taylor the test captaincy as a compromise. Taylor refused this offer and also refused to tour South Africa in December 2012 and January 2013.\n \nThe reason given for his sacking was his poor winning record over his 13 tests \u2212 4 won, 7 lost, and 2 drawn. In fact, Taylor's record as captain is very similar to Stephen Fleming's and Daniel Vettori's. Fleming won 5 of his first 13 tests and Vettori 4. David Leggat writing in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'' states that the poor winning record is not entirely Taylor's fault and doubts whether installing McCullum as captain will make any difference.\n\nThe following table shows that the only batsman adequately performing during his tenure was Ross Taylor himself.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!  !!Matches !!

Some play was lost to rain in this test as well but not enough to prevent NZ winning on the third day of the test. Just as in Dunedin, the West Indies skipper won the toss and had no hesitation in putting New Zealand in on a green pitch. Just as in Dunedin the West Indies bowled poorly and NZ amassed a big first innings score. The openers failed again but [[Ross Taylor]] and [[Kane Williamson]] (45) put on 88 for the third wicket, Taylor and [[Brendon McCullum]](37) put on 77 for the fourth wicket, and Taylor and [[Corey Anderson]] (38) put on 68 for the fifth wicket. Taylor's 129 was his tenth Test hundred and his second century in consecutive tests. He scored 217 in Dunedin. After Taylor departed at 296, [[BJ Watling]] and the tail added a further 145 runs.\n\nAt the end of day two the West Indies were reasonably well placed at 158/4, chasing NZ's first innings score of 441.

[[Tim Southee]] took 4/79 and [[Corey Anderson]] 3/49.\n\nOn a pitch taking turn the NZ openers again got starts but failed to go on.

When Taylor (131) got out at 306/7 he had again held the New Zealand innings together and had scored his third century in successive tests. New Zealand finished with a small first innings deficit of 17.\n\nWith a small first innings lead, and a fine spinner in Sunil Narine to bowl at NZ who had to bat fourth on a pitch taking spin, the West Indies were in the box seat at tea on the third day. However the West Indies were all out for a 103 in a single session. New Zealand's four-man pace attack were relentless with their tight lines and fuller lengths. [[Trent Boult]] took the first three West Indies wickets and [[Tim Southee]] took three wickets in the last over of the innings to end with 3\u201312 \u2013 his second wicket making him the 12th New Zealand player to capture 100 test wickets. Boult finished with 4\u201323.\n\nNew Zealand had to chase down 122 to win. [[Kane Williamson]] scored 56 and [[Hamish Rutherford]] 48*.\n\nNew Zealand completed their first series victory over a top-eight nation since they beat the same opposition in 2006. Against one of the weakest West Indies side to ever visit New Zealand, the homeside were dominant in all three matches. But for rain in Dunedin they would have won the series 3\u20130.\n\nDeposed captain [[Ross Taylor]] scored three centuries in each of the three tests finishing the series with 495 runs at an average of 247.50. At the end of the series his career average stood at 47.51 which is better than the averages that [[Martin Crowe]] (45.36) and [[Glenn Turner]] (44.64) finished their careers with. At the end of this series only two New Zealanders had more centuries than Taylor \u2013 Martin Crowe (17) and John Wright (12).\n\nAll-rounder [[Corey Anderson]], playing in his first home series, took 8 wickets at an average of 18.37 and scored 97 runs at an average of 32.33. [[Kane Williamson]] also averaged 53 with the bat. Boult took 20 wickets in the series at an average of 15.40 while Southee grabbed 18 scalps at 18.11\n\n=== 75 v India at Auckland 2013/14 ''NZ won by 40 runs'' ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-india-2014/engine/current/match/667651.html|title=1st Test: New Zealand v India at Auckland, Feb 6\u20139, 2014 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nOn a grassy drop-in pitch at Eden Park, the Indian captain was delighted to win the toss and bowl. Not long after, New Zealand were 30 for 3. [[Kane Williamson]] and [[Brendon McCullum]] responded with aggressive hundreds and added 221 in 51 overs. Williamson scored 113 and McCullum was not out on 143 at the end of day one. NZ was in complete control of the match at 329/4.\n\nThe following day McCullum added another 174 runs with the tail and was last out for 224, one short of his highest test score. [[Corey Anderson]] scored 77 and New Zealand finished with 503.\n\n[[Trent Boult]] took two wickets in the first over of India's innings and [[Tim Southee]] bounced out [[Virat Kohli]] in the fifth over. India recovered somewhat to end day two on 130/4. On a humid day three morning the New Zealand fast bowlers ripped through India. In 13 overs from Boult and Southee, India could manage only 28 for 2. Once Southee and Boult finished their spells, [[Neil Wagner]] maintained the same intensity and picked up three of the last four wickets. The tail could only add 35 runs after Dhoni's dismissal and India were bowled out for 202, 45 minutes before lunch. Both Boult and Southee took 3/38 and Wagner 4/64.\n\nBizarrely, McCullum did not enforce the follow-on. New Zealand's second innings was a classic example of a Black Caps batting collapse. They were 15/4 at lunch on the third day. [[Ross Taylor]] top scored with 41 and the last pair added 25. Nevertheless, the 301-run first innings lead combined with their second innings score of 105 left India with a very challenging target of 407 to win in over two days on a flat wicket. (The highest successful fourth innings target is 418)\n\nThe Indian top order kept their team in the chase. After 80 overs India were well placed at 268/5. However, the arrival of the second new ball sealed their fate. Boult took a wicket with the first delivery of the second new ball and Southee with the seventh. India lost their last 5 wickets for 98 runs in 16.3 overs against the second new ball and NZ secured a thrilling 40-run win. The NZ fast bowlers, Southee, Boult, and Wagner took all 20 wickets in the match. Southee, Boult took 3 wickets in each innings and Wagner took 4 wickets in each innings. Neil Wagner's match figures of 8 for 126 were his best in a Test Match. His previous-best was 7 for 116 against Bangladesh in Mirpur last year. McCullum was named the player of the match.\nDavid Leggat in ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]''wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\nTim Southee, Trent Boult and Neil Wagner have a look about them that suggests they are well down the road to becoming one of New Zealand's better seam groups. Southee and Boult have tended to garner more headlines than the bustling Otago left armer Wagner. But on Sunday, as Wagner charged in during a hostile 10-over spell on a warm afternoon when the test was in the balance, he was outstanding. Seldom can a spell of 10\u20133\u201326\u20132 by a New Zealand bowler have had an impact so far outweighing the bare numbers. He removed Virat Kohli when the Indian champion was sailing along on 67, then produced a snorting lifter to remove centurymaker Shikhar Dhawan to turn the contest at a point where India were in cruise mode.\n<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11199595 | work=The New Zealand Herald | title=Cricket: Hard-working trio becoming force to be reckoned with \u2013 Sport \u2013 NZ Herald News | date=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Jesse Ryder]] who had made a return to playing limited overs cricket for NZ was named as 12th man. The night before the test started he was out drinking until the wee hours with the 13th man, [[Doug Bracewell]] . Even though they did not make the team they sure made the headlines and the NZ cricket team were reportedly livid that their misbehaviour gained more attention that their stunning victory.\n\nDespite most of the batsmen performing adequately (see table below) during McCullum's first 13 tests, he actually won fewer tests than [[Ross Taylor]] \u2013 Taylor won 4 tests out of 13 and McCullum 3 out of 13.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!  !!Matches !!

On 25 November 2014, [[Phillip Hughes]] was knocked unconscious by a bouncer, during a Sheffield Shield match at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n\nOn 26 November, Pakistan won toss, chose to bat on a flat track and reached 281/3. The following day Hughes died and the New Zealand team considered forfeiting the match. However, in the end the teams decided to suspend the test for one day.\n\nAfter the test resumed on 27 November, Pakistan collapsed to be all out for 351. The Pakistani captain said\n\n\"... after [Hughes death] it was really difficult to concentrate. It was very difficult for the batsmen to carry on when we came out on the third day. It created difficulties for us.\" [[Mark Craig]], the NZ offspinner, ran through the bottom half of Pakistan's batting to register a career-best haul of 7 for 94.\n \nCraig said that his mind was not on the game. \" [I] didn't really think, to be honest. It was hard playing and we boys tried to stick together,\" Craig said. \"Just not thinking about bowling and letting the ball go was a big help.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-v-new-zealand-2014/content/current/story/805939.html|title=Batsmen lost focus on the third morning \u2013 Misbah|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe New Zealanders did not celebrate the fall of each Pakistan wicket with the usual whooping and high-fives.\n\nWhen New Zealand batted, Brendon McCullum (202) and Kane Williamson (192) appeared to have no difficulty concentrating and they put on 297 \u2013 the highest ever partnership for the second wicket. [[Ross Taylor]], [[Corey Anderson]], [[Mark Craig]], and [[Tim Southee]] also scored fifties and NZ amassed 690 \u2013 the highest innings total for NZ.\n\nPakistan had to score 339 just to make NZ bat again or bat for five-and-a-half sessions to save the Test. They managed neither. [[Trent Boult]] dismissed the first 3 batsmen and Pakistan were reeling at 24 for 3. Mark Craig snared two more and Pakistan were 63 for 5. Pakistan were eventually dismissed for 259. Boult took 4 for 38. Craig got 3 more wickets to give him match figures of 10 for 203.\n\nThe match was littered with records and personal milestones:\n\n*690 was NZ' highest innings total.\n*It was the first time six NZ batsmen had scored over 50 in an innings.\n*McCullum and Williamson's 297-run partnership is NZ's highest for the second wicket.\n*McCullum's reached 50 in 30 balls \u2013 the second fastest 50 in NZ test history.\n*McCullum's reached 100 in 78 balls \u2013 the fastest century in NZ test history.\n*McCullum had scored two double centuries and a triple century in a calendar year.\n*Williamson's 192 was his highest test score\n*Williamson's 8th test century was the most by any New Zealander at age 24.\n*Craig is the fifth New Zealander to score a fifty and take 10 wickets in a match. He was also named man of the match\n\nHowever, the shadow of Phillip Hughes' death loomed throughout the Test with players from both teams hardly showing emotions on personal achievements. Vettori summed up the mood: \"We felt like he was one of us and we mourned him as a team-mate.\"\n\nVettori was playing in his first test match since July 2012. He was asked to play at the last minute as NZ wanted to play 3 spinners. He agreed on the proviso that his work load would be small.\n\nThis turned out to be Vettori's last test. He played 113 tests, scored 4531 runs and took 362 wickets.\n\nDylan Cleaver and David Leggat in the NZ herald rated this win one of NZ's five best overseas victories and discussed whether the current teams was one of NZ's best ever sides.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&objectid=11369019|title=Cricket: Golden eras vie for mantle of most legendary|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== 79 v Sri Lanka at Christchurch 2014/15 ''NZ won by 8 wickets'' ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Scorecard<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-sri-lanka-2014-15/engine/match/749777.html|title=1st Test: New Zealand v Sri Lanka at Christchurch, Dec 26\u201329, 2014 \u2013 Cricket Scorecard \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n|}\n\nTest cricket returned to Christchurch after an eight-year absence at a new venue \u2013 [[Hagley Park, Christchurch|Hagley Park]]. [[Lancaster Park]] was damaged beyond repair in the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].\n\nSri Lanka won the toss and inserted NZ on a green wicket. However, they bowled poorly and took 19 overs to reduce New Zealand to 88 for 3. The fall of [[Ross Taylor]]'s wicket bought [[Brendon McCullum]] to the crease and he nearly scored the fastest double century in test history. He smashed 195 off 134 balls. He added 126 with [[Kane Williamson]] (54) who only contributed 20 runs to this partnership. [[Jimmy Neesham]] also scored 85 off 80 balls and helped NZ score 427 runs on the first day of this test match off only 80.3 overs \u2013 the second-highest they have ever made in a day's Test cricket.\n\nSri Lanka were unable to cope with the swing and seam of [[Tim Southee]] and [[Trent Boult]]. Boult dismissed the first 3 batsmen and Sri Lanka were in deep trouble 15 for 3. Boult eventually finished with 3 for 25 and [[Neil Wagner]] 3 for 60.\n\nMcCullum enforced the follow-on but the NZ bowlers were unable to repeat their first innings performance, and took 154 overs to bowl the Sri Lankans out for 407. Boult took 4 for 100 and Southee 4 for 91.\n\nNew Zealand needed to score only 107 to win and did so with the loss of 2 wickets.\n\nThis was New Zealand's fifth win of 2014 \u2013 their most ever in a calendar year. New Zealand played 9 \u2013 Won 5, lost 2 and drew 2. McCullum and Williamson were the stars with the bat. In 2014, McCullum scored two double centuries, a triple century and 195. Southee & Boult were the stars with the ball and after this match [[Russel Arnold]] described them as the best new-ball pair around. \nhttp://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/video_audio/814775.html\n\n[[Ross Taylor]] had a quiet year but was still ranked as the eleventh best batsmen in the world. (ICC rankings) McCullum was 12th and Williamson was 13th. Boult was ranked the 7th best bowler and Southee the 9th.

However the Sri Lankans won the toss for the second time in a row and sent NZ in to bat. The pitch did not seem as difficult as expected and NZ was untroubled reaching 141 for 2 in 32 overs. The Sri Lankans bowled more economically and NZ lost 8 wickets for 80 runs playing ambitious shots. [[Kane Williamson]] (69) top-scored in NZ's 221.\n\nThe New Zealand bowlers found swing straightaway and at the end of day 1 Sri Lanka were in deep trouble at 78 for 5. On day 2, [[Kumar Sangakkara]] (33 not out overnight) not only survived the NZ swing bowling, he scored 203 and added a further 278 with the last 5 batsmen and gave Sri Lanka a 135-run first innings lead.\n\nNZ lost 4 wickets wiping of the deficit and when Nesham fell, NZ were only 25 ahead with 5 wickets left. However the wicket was now a good batting strip and [[Kane Williamson]] and [[BJ Watling]] batted slowly and carefully to see NZ through to 253 for 5 and the end of day 3.\n\nOn Day 4, Williamson and Watling batted on and when [[Brendon McCullum]] finally declared on 524 for 5 they held the record for all countries for the highest sixth wicket partnership \u2013 365 unbroken.\n \nStatistical highlights include:\n*Williamson's 242* was his highest test score.\n*Watling's 142* was his highest test score.\n*Watling broke his own partnership record \u2013 the previous record of 352 (scored with McCullum) was less than a year old. A bronze plaque commemorating the old record had been set in concrete at the [[Basin Reserve]] just three days earlier.\n*The partnershipis was New Zealand's third highest for any wicket.\n\nMcCullum's declaration set Sri Lankan a target of 390 to win in 107 overs. Even though the pitch was still easy for batting Sri Lanka were all out for 196. [[Trent Boult]] and [[Doug Bracewell]] did the early damage before [[Mark Craig]] (4\u201353) ran through the tail to complete one of New Zealand's most remarkable Test wins. Only once before had New Zealand they had recovered from a first innings deficit of more than 100 to win a game. The only other example was victory number 32 against Pakistan in 1994 and it is possible Pakistan threw this match.\n \nIf Sri Lanka's fielding had been better the result could have been very different. Williamson was dropped on 29, 60 and 104.\n\nWilliamson's average at the end of this test was 45.95, higher than [[Martin Crowe]]'s final average of 45.36 and higher than [[Ross Taylor]]'s current average of 45.40. He also took the least number of innings of any New Zealander to reach 3000 runs (71-two fewer than Crowe).

England won the toss and put NZ in and soon had them 68\u20133. While [[Tom Latham (cricketer)|Tom Latham]] compiled a careful 84, the middle order and lower order scored at better than a run a ball. [[Luke Ronchi]] on his debut aged 34 scored 88 off 70 balls. The final total of 350 was scored at 4.84 runs per over. Ronchi, the reserve keeper, was only playing because Watling's knee was too sore for him to keep wicket.\n\nEngland's openers responded with a first wicket stand of 177 and threatened to take the game away from NZ. However [[Tim Southee]] and [[Trent Boult]] got NZ back in the game by destroying England's middle order. They took 7 for 90. Runs from Englands's last 3 batsmen enabled them to match NZ's first innings score of 350. Southee took 4 \u2013 83.\n\nWith the weather forecast poor for the remainder of the match NZ again sought quick runs in the second innings but lost two quick wickets. This did not slow down the scoring rate however and [[Martin Guptill]] 70 and [[Ross Taylor]] 48 both scored at a run a ball. [[Brendon McCullum]] scored a relatively slow 55 but [[BJ Watling]] who scored his fifth test century put on quick runs with the lower middle order. Ronchi 31, [[Mark Craig]] 58* Southee 40, and [[Matt Henry (cricketer)|Matt Henry]] 12 all scored at a brisk pace. NZ scored 190 runs in the last 30 overs of the innings. When Watling fell at 368 the slog began. Craig, Southee and Henry added 88 runs in 8 overs. McCullum declared at 454/8 off 91 overs. The run rate was 4.98.\n\nMuch of the fourth day was lost to rain so the rate at which NZ batted was crucial to giving them enough time to bowl England out. England was 44 with out loss at the end of day 4. Overnight some of the English players talked up their chances of chasing down what would be a record target of 454 to win. However, in the first 15 overs of day 5 England scored 18 runs and lost 4 wickets. Boult got 2 and Craig got 2 in one over. At 62 for 4 England were battling for a draw. [[Kane Williamson]] later picked up 3 wickets with his part-time spin and England were all out with 20 overs still left in the day.\n\nStarting with Bangladesh series in October 2013 this was seventh unbeaten series, most by any New Zealand side. During the game, Hesson and McCullum were awarded the New Zealand Order of Merit in the Queen's Birthday Honours List for NZ's wonderful performance in the Cricket World Cup \u2013 NZ lost to Australia in the final.\n\n== 2015/16 to 2025 ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Played  \n| '''WON '''10\n| Lost \n| Drew \n|-\n|}\n\nfrom July 2015 to 2025\n\n===82 v Sri Lanka at Dunedin 2015/16 ''NZ won by 122 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-sri-lanka-2015-16/engine/match/914203.html Scorecard]\n\nNew Zealand were in control of this match from start to finish. The Sri Lankan captain won the toss but put NZ in to bat to protect his inexperienced batsmen from the potent swing of [[Tim Southee]] and [[Trent Boult]]. Even so, Sri Lanka did not take a wicket until the 16th over. Opener[[Martin Guptill]] (156) and [[Kane Williamson]] (88) then put on 173 for the second wicket. [[Brendon McCullum]] then smashed 75 runs off 57 balls and [[Doug Bracewell]] a more sedate 47 off 59 balls. NZ scored 409/8 on the first day and were finally all out for 431. The run rate was 4.48 per over.\n\nOn a good pitch Sri Lanka could only score at 2.5 runs per over. They crawled to 197/4 at the close of day two. On the moring of day three NZ picked up the final 6 wickets for 97 runs. Sri Lanka were eventually dismissed for 294 in 117.1 overs, conceding a first-innings lead of 137. Southee had the best bowling figures of 3/71.\n\nIn the third innings it was the other openers turn to score a century. [[Tom Latham (cricketer)|Tom Latham]] put on 79 with Guptil and then 141 with Williamson (71). During this innings Williamson scored his thousandth run in 2015. Latham's 109* was his third test century. With one eye on the weather McCullum declared before lunch on Day 4. NZ's 267/3, at 4.06 per over, set Sri Lanka a target of 405.\n\nSri Lanka limped to 109/3 off 50 overs at the end of a rain interrupted day 4. Day 5 dawned sunny. However, on a good batting pitch NZ found wickets hard to come by. Throughout the match Boult and Southee bowled mostly a full length looking for swing. [[Neil Wagner]] however often targeted the batsmens ribs, hustling them with pace, forcing hurried evasive actions and awkward fends off the body. Wagner offered something different on a flat pitch and broke stubborn partnerships. NZ bowled Sri Lanka out for 282 ten overs after lunch on day 5. Sri Lanka batted for 40 more overs than NZ in the match but their much slower run rate meant they scored 122 runs fewer.\n\nAt the end of the match [[Kane Williamson]] was ranked the third best batsman in the world by the ICC player rankings.\n\n===83 v Sri Lanka at Hamilton 2015/16 ''NZ won by 5 wickets''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-sri-lanka-2015-16/engine/match/914205.html  Scorecard]\n\n[[Brendon McCullum]] won the toss and put Sri Lanka in to bat on a pitch so green the Sri Lankan coach claimed it had been \"doctored\" and had 18mm of grass on it. However, there was not much swing and seam on offer and [[Tim Southee]] didn't get the first wicket until the 13th over. Sri Lanka were 259 for 4 at one stage but NZ picked up the last 6 wickets for 33 runs. 292 turned out to be the highest innings of the match. [[Tim Southee]] was the best bowler taking 3 for 63.\n\nSri Lanka's bowlers could not find much swing or seam either and NZ openers put on 81 for the first wicket. [[Martin Guptill]] made 50. Sri Lanka tried bowling bouncers and like moths to a flame the NZ top and middle order hooked, pulled and slogged their way back to the dressing room. [[Kane Williamson]]'s hook shot to a ball over his head and outside off stump was one of the worst of the lot. NZ was 89 for 4 and then 128 for 5. The lower order managed the short ball better but most eventually fell to bouncers and NZ were all out for 237 conceding a first innings lead of 55.\n\nThe NZ bowlers began by bowling outside off stump looking for swing and seam. The Sri Lankan openers put on 71 runs before the NZ bowlers gave up and started bowling bouncers. The quickening pitch did not have had much seam but there was plenty of bounce. McCullum set fields reminiscent of the bodyline series in the 1930s and the Sri Lankan batsmen obliged by hooking and pulling into the traps set and in a barely believable collapse lost 10 wickets for 62 runs.  Southee took 4 for 26 and [[Neil Wagner]] 3 for 40.\n\nNZ was set 189 to win. Sri Lanka starting bowling bouncers right from the outset. Opener [[Tom Latham (cricketer)|Tom Latham]] got hit on the head and then hooked the ball down square leg for 4. The other opener [[Martin Guptill]] fended a good short ball to leg slip. Willamson and Taylor (35) added 67 before Taylor hooked a bouncer to fine leg. Williamson and Brendon \"That's-just-the-way-I-play\" McCullum (18) added 52 before McCullum slogged a short ball straight up in the air. Williamson and [[Mitchell Santner]] (4) added 12 before Satner edged a good short ball to the keeper. At the end of day three NZ was 142 for 5, Williamson was on 78* and [[BJ Watling]] on 0*.\n\nOn Day 4, Williamson farmed the strike and got to his 13th test century before Watling got off the mark. Williamson added 42 with Watling and carried NZ to a 5 wicket victory. Unlike most of the other batsmen in the match Williamson learned from his first innings mistake, and was able to resist hooking or pulling anything above shoulder height. He scored an unbeaten 108, and won the match for New Zealand.\n\nAt the end of the match Williamson:\n* had scored 1172 runs in the calendar year \u2013 more than any other New Zealander ( average 90.15)\n* had scored 5 centuries in a calendar year \u2013 more than any other New Zealander.\n* increased his test average to 49.93.\n* scored the second most centuries by any New Zealander (13)\n* was ranked the number one test batsmen in the world by the ICC.\n\nNew Zealand equalled its longest unbeaten sequence of tests at home: 13.\n\nAfter the match McCullum announced that the following two tests against Australia in February 2016 would be his last.\n\nIn April 2016 Wisden named Williamson as the leading cricketer in the world for 2015.\n\n===84 v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo 2016 ''NZ won by an innings and 117 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/zimbabwe-v-new-zealand-2016/engine/match/1024041.html Scorecard]\n\nZimbabwe won the toss and chose to bat on a tame surface. Although Southee swung the ball he was only able to pick up one early wicket. Boult was unable to find much movement in the air at all. Wagner employed a short-ball strategy and the hosts fell from 35 for 1 to 36 for 4, and then, in the post-lunch session, lost four wickets with the score on 72. Wagner eventually took his career-best in an innings of 6 for 41. Zimbabwe were only saved from being dismissed for the lowest first-innings score in Bulawayo by their tail. At one stage they were 72 for 8 but they scored 164.\n\nThe NZ openers put on 79 with easy before Guptill was out for 40. Latham (105) and Williamson (91) put on 156 for the second wicket and carried NZ well past the Zimbabwe first innings score with just one wicket down. Taylor (173*) and Watling (107) put on 253 for the sixth wicket. Williamson, in his first test as captain, declared when Watling fell at 576 for 6. Zimbabwe had not played a test match for 20 months and their bowlers were no match for a strong New Zealand batting line up.\n\nZimbabwe were chasing 412 to avoid an innings defeat. After 4 overs Boult and Southee had reduced them to 17 for 4. Wagner bounced one more out and later they were 85 for 6 and staring at another mediocre score. However, the last 5 wickets scored 209 runs. The second innings total of 295 was a vast improvement over the first innings but Zimbabwe were comprehensively out played by a strong New Zealand team.\n\n===85 v Zimbabwe at Bulawayo 2016 ''NZ won by 254 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10694/scorecard/1024043/zimbabwe-vs-new-zealand-2nd-test-new-zealand-tour-of-zim-2016/ Scorecard]\n\nThe second test of the series was also played in Bulawayo not in the capital Harare. There was no tests in Harare for the Kiwis on this tour because Harare was the epicentre of a nationwide strikes to protest the lack of jobs, unpaid wages of public servants and general economic mismanagement by the Mugabe regime.\n\nThe protesters also came to Bulawayo. At the start of the 36th over some of the spectators stood up and sang the national anthem and waived the Zimbabwean flag. The 36 refers to the number of years Mugabe had been in to power.  The mismanagement of Zimbabwean cricket along with everything else in Zimbabwe left their cricket team weak and open to slaughter.\n\nThe entire Zimbabwe team had only 43 caps. 8 NZ players had played more than 20 tests. Williamson and Southee's were playing in their 50th test and Ross Taylor in his 71st.\n\nWhen the protesters started waiving their flags at the start of the 36th over, NZ who had won the toss and chose to bat first were 120 for none. At the end of day 1, NZ were 329 for 2. Guptill scored 87 and Latham 136. NZ declared at 582 for 4. Williamson scored 113, Taylor 124* and Watling 83*.\nWhen Zimbabwe had their turn on a flat track they replied with 362, Sodhi taking 4 for 60 \u2013 his best bowling in an innings.\n\nWilliamson chose not to enforce the follow on. Instead the New Zealanders sought quick runs. Unfortunately, they lost both openers trying to force the pace. However, Williamson (68*) and Taylor (67*) were able to prosper and NZ scored 166 for 2 off 36 overs. Williamson's declaration set Zimbabwe a target of 387 to win.\n\nIn their run chase, Zimbabwe was a victim of some truly terrible umpiring with 4 poor decisions in their total of 132. Sodhi got 3 for 19, and Guptill with his part-time off spin 3 for 11 \u2013 his best bowling in an innings.\n\nNew Zealand's victory by 254 runs was their biggest in terms of runs. Over the two tests Ross Taylor scored 364 runs without being dismissed and improved his career batting average to 48.66. Williamson averaged 136 in 2 tests and improved his career average to 51.29. Latham, Watling and Guptill also improved their batting averages, and Wagner, Boult, Sodhi and Santner improved their bowling averages\n\n===86 v Pakistan at Christchurch 2016/17 ''NZ won by 8 wickets''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10677/scorecard/1019993/new-zealand-vs-pakistan-1st-test-pakistan-tour-of-nz-2016-17/ Scorecard]\n\nPakistan's came to NZ as the number two test side in the world. However, they had to face not only the Black Caps but the elements too. Their warm-up game in Nelson was abandoned without a ball being bowled and the 7.8 magnitude 2016 Kaikoura earthquake at two minutes after midnight on 14 November left some members of Pakistani team so afraid to return to their hotel room that they preferred to sleep in the hotel lobby. After arriving in Christchurch not only were they greeted with hundreds of aftershocks but with spring weather and a Hagley oval green-top.\n\nNZ had two new debutants, [[Colin de Grandhomme]] and [[Jeet Raval]]. After the first day had been rained off Williamson won the toss and put the Pakistanis in.\nPakistan survived the first hour against Boult and Southee but after de Grandhomme, bowling first change, removed Azhar Ali, the floodgates opened.  De Grandhomme's slower pace but greater accuracy made his swing and seam more dangerous than Boult and Southee. De Grandhomme's 6 for 41 was the best performance by a NZ debutant. Pakistan scored 133.\n \nThere was still plenty of life in the pitch when NZ batted, but the other debutant Jeet Raval look at ease while his while his partners struggled. De Grandhomme scored a quickfire 29 and the last 5 NZ batsmen scored 64. By contrast the last 5 Pakistani batsmen scored just 23 runs. Raval scored 55 out of 200.\n\nNZ's 67 run first innings lead was invaluable as Pakistan lost 3 wickets knocking it off. The first 3 Pakistan batsman managed to bat for 40 overs but scored at only 1.45 runs per over. Eventually Wagner bowled a barrage of short balls aimed at the ribs and took 2 for 9 off 11 overs. Wagner got his 100th wicket in his 26th test. Only Hadlee reached this mark faster for NZ (in his 25th test). Boult and Southee then finished the Pakistanis off. Boult got 3/37, Southee 3/54 and Wagner 3/34.\n\nKane Williamson described his teams bowling in Pakistan's second innings as the \"decisive period\". He also said:\n\n\"We were hoping for some movement off the surface and Pakistan showed a lot of resistance \u2013 especially early \u2013 and were very patient. But the way that four seamers got into spells and held their areas for long periods at a time, it was world-class. They passed it over for the next bloke to take up the baton, and it was a huge effort being patient and getting the rewards later on in the day yesterday. We didn't get the ball to do a huge amount in the second innings, but we held our lines and our lengths really consistently for a long period of time. It was really important to make that adjustment quickly and not get too greedy and overpitch, because in the first innings you did need to bowl fuller to get those rewards.\"<ref>http://www.espncricinfo.com/new-zealand-v-pakistan-2016-17/content/story/1067381.html</ref>\n\nApart from Latham going early, NZ had no trouble scoring the required 105 runs for victory. Williamson scored 61 and fittingly Raval (36*) hit the winning runs. Colin de Grandhomme was the player of the match.\n\n===87 v Pakistan at Hamilton 2016/17 ''NZ won by 138 runs''===\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10677/scorecard/1019995/new-zealand-vs-pakistan-2nd-test-pakistan-tour-of-nz-2016-17/ Scorecard]\n\nAfter viewing the green pitch in Hamilton, Pakistan picked an all-seam attack and as luck would have it won the toss. The Pakistani bowlers were not as accurate as the conditions demanded and wasted their opportunity to run through NZ. Rain saw that only 21 overs were possible on day 1 and NZ got to 77/2. On day 2 NZ lost 3 early wickets and were 119 for 5. Raval in his second test scored 55. The lower rallied around Watling (49*) and NZ's total of 271 was a good return on a green pitch.\n\nWhen Pakistan batted, Tim Southee on his home ground bowled much fuller and in reduced Pakistan to 12 for 3 in 9 overs. Wagner later got two wickets in two balls and Pakistan were 51 for 5. Rain allowed only 38 overs of play on day 3. Southee got another three wickets and finished with 6/80 and Wagner 3/59. Trent Boult could not play in this test due to injury. Pakistan scored 216.\n\nBy day 4, the pitch had flattened out considerably, and was offering much less seam movement. The sun was out and NZ piled on the runs. NZ's run rate accelerated through the day.  Latham (80) and Williamson (42) scored slowly but set a foundation for the middle order. Taylor (102*) scored his 16th test hundred off 134 balls and Colin de Grandhomme scored 32 off 21 balls. NZ declared at 313/5 and set Pakistan a target of 369 on day 5.\n\nAt lunch on day 5, Pakistan were 76 for none. At tea Pakistan were 158 for 1. They need 211 off at least 34 overs with 9 wickets left (a run rate of 6.2) \nAt the fall of the second wicket Pakistan promoted their hard-hitting keeper to number four in an effort to get the target. However he ran himself out at for 19. At 199 for 4, Pakistan appeared to shut up shop. At this stage there were around 24 overs left for Pakistan to survive. However they collapsed in dramatic fashion. They lost their 5th wicket with 20 overs left, their 6th wicket with 17 overs left and their 7th wicket with 12 overs left in the match. Wagner took the 8th and 9th wickets with 11 overs left and then he took the last wicket with 9 overs left. Pakistan had collapsed from a seemingly impregnable 158 for 1 at tea to 230 all out in 25.1 overs. They lost 9 wicket for 72 runs in the last session of the match. Wagner finished with 3 for 57.\n\nSouthee was named Man of the Match.\n\nIn their debut series, opener Raval scored 2 fifties and finished with a test average of 49.33. All-rounder de Grandhomme averaged 32.66 with the bat, and took 9 wickets at an average of 12.22.\n\nNZ won the 2 test series 2\u20130. NZ had last beaten Pakistan in a series in 1985 \u2013 32 years ago. In between, NZ had lost 7 series and drawn 5.\n\n===88 v Bangladesh at Wellington 2016/17 ''NZ won by 7 wickets''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10680/scorecard/1019985/new-zealand-vs-bangladesh-1st-test-bangladesh-tour-of-new-zealand-2016-17/ Scorecard]\n\nIn the lead up to this rain-affected test, it was felt that the visiting Bangladesh side would be caught off-guard by the conditions, given their poor record outside of the subcontinent. However, after Williamson won the toss and sent Bangladesh in to bat on a green-looking surface, the New Zealand bowlers showed a general lack of discipline throughout the innings. Boult was particularly expensive, and struggled to find any sideways movement through the air or off the pitch. Despite losing nearly 50 overs on the first day to rain, Bangladesh managed to post a mammoth 595/8 in their first innings, with Boult (2/131), Southee (2/158) and Wagner (4/151) all conceding over 100 runs.\n\nNew Zealand fought back with the bat to reach 539. Many batsmen in the lineup made promising starts but failed to capitalise on the now batting-friendly wicket, with only Latham (177) being able to press on and make a large total. Latham's century was his sixth in Test cricket, the third-most by any New Zealand opener after John Wright (12) and Glenn Turner (7), and wrestled some of the initiative away from Bangladesh. Bowling all-rounder Santner also produced a career-best 73 to help reduce New Zealand's first innings deficit to 56. Having held the advantage for much of the Test, Bangladesh suddenly crumbled, being dismissed for only 160 seven overs before lunch on the final day. New Zealand's second innings bowling effort was an improvement on the first but much of Bangladesh's dismal showing could be attributed to a lack of application and poor shot selection from the batsmen. The Bangladeshi cause was also not helped when the captain Mushfiqur Rahim had to be stretchered off the ground, having received a sickening blow to the back of the head. New Zealand briskly chased down the 217 runs required for the loss of three wickets, with Williamson (104*) reaching his 15th Test century off just 89 deliveries - the fourth-fastest in the final innings of a test - and adding 163 for the third wicket with Taylor (60), their eighth hundred partnership in Tests.\n\nBangladesh's first innings total was the highest in a losing cause, and New Zealand's overall fourth innings run rate of 5.47 was the third-highest in Test history.\n\n===89 v Bangladesh at Christchurch 2016/17 ''NZ won by 9 wickets''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10680/scorecard/1019987/new-zealand-vs-bangladesh-2nd-test-bangladesh-tour-of-new-zealand-2016-17/ Scorecard]\n\nFor the second time in the series, Bangladesh imploded in the second innings after holding their own in the first, handing New Zealand a 9-wicket victory. Williamson once again called correctly and sent an injury-ravaged Bangladesh side in to bat. It looked to be a dubious decision after Bangladesh were sitting fairly comfortably at 165/2 after 35 overs. However, Southee (5/94) and Boult (4/87) were able to rally after breaking the third wicket partnership, eventually restricting Bangladesh to 289. The innings may well have been wrapped up even more swiftly had New Zealand held on to more of their catches, and Williamson's tactic of bombarding the lower order with short deliveries rather than bowling length and looking for swing may have further extended Bangladesh's innings. Southee's 5-wicket haul was his sixth in Test cricket.\n\nNew Zealand responded with an adequate, but not remarkable, total of 354. Middle order batsman Nicholls (98) fell just two runs short of a century, dragging a wide ball back onto his stumps. Latham (68) and Taylor (77) also made starts but gave away their wickets on a relatively placid Hagley Park surface. Useful contributions were also made by Santner (29) and Wagner (26), with the latter being run out in bizarre circumstances. Having charged back for a second run, Wagner crossed the crease at the bowler's end but did not ground his bat. As both feet were in the air at the time the bails were removed, the batsman was deemed not to have made his ground and was given as run out by the third umpire. This run out ended New Zealand's first innings, giving them a lead of 65.\n\nWith the situation in the Test relatively poised, Bangladesh was in a reasonable position to draw the match or even set up a moderately difficult chase given New Zealand had to bat last. By tea on the fourth day, however, they had been reduced to 100/5 - effectively 35/5 - and were able to register just 173 in total, with Boult (3/52), Southee (3/48) and Wagner (3/44) all among the wickets. New Zealand were able to chase down the 109 runs required with minimal incident, with Latham (41*) and the promoted de Grandhomme (33*) seeing them home that evening. The victory also sealed a 2-0 whitewash for the series, and continued a strong run at home for the Blackcaps.\n\n===90 v West Indies at Wellington 2017/18 ''NZ won by an innings and 67 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17952/scorecard/1115793/new-zealand-vs-west-indies-1st-test-wi-in-nz-2017-18/ Scorecard]\n\nThe visiting West Indies side came into this Test match off the back of a spectacular victory at Lord's, and confidence was high that they would provide some stiff opposition to the home side. In the end, they were beaten comprehensively despite being in a solid position for parts of the match.\n\nWilliamson won the toss and had no hesitation in sending the visitors in to bat on a pitch which looked as green as the turf surrounding it. However, within the first few overs it was apparent that there was little sideways movement on offer for either of the opening bowlers. Boult and Henry bowled relatively tidy spells but were unable to make breakthroughs on a surface which was offering little or no assistance in spite of its green appearance. The West Indies top order experienced little difficulty in the first session of the Test and moved the score on to 79/1 just before lunch. Sensing that the original plan was not working, the New Zealand skipper changed tack and opted to bring on Wagner, dropping back square leg and bringing a catching short-leg into place. The change in tactics had almost immediate effect; a devastating short-ball barrage from the left-armer ripped through the West Indies lineup to leave them dismissed for just 134 shortly before tea on the first day. Wagner ended up with career-best figures of 7/39 and his 5th 5 wicket haul in Test cricket.\n\nThe New Zealand innings began promisingly enough, with a 65-run opening stand between Latham (37) and Raval (42) and a solid fourth wicket partnership of 127 between Taylor (97) and Nicholls (67). However, after Taylor fell seven runs short of his century the middle order was dismissed in relatively quick succession, leaving the New Zealand innings stalling somewhat at 281/6. Debutant wicketkeeper-batsman Tom Blundell joined de Grandhomme (105) at the crease and the pair added 148 for the seventh wicket, the highest NZ seventh-wicket partnership against the West Indies. Blundell resumed his innings at the beginning of the 3rd day on 58*, with New Zealand 9 wickets down. Despite this, the No. 11 Boult was able to see Blundell (107*) through to his unbeaten maiden test century. It was the first time in Test history that a NZ wicketkeeper had made a hundred on debut. When Williamson eventually declared, New Zealand had made their way to 520/9 and were in a commanding position. An innings defeat seemed inevitable.\n\nHowever, the West Indies showed much more resistance in their second innings, and were able to play the short ball of Wagner much more effectively than in the first. Steady batting from the top order saw them through to 217/2 at the end of the third day, still 172 runs in arrears but in a decent position to avoid the innings defeat with Boult, Henry and Wagner struggling in the batting-friendly conditions. When Santner broke through to remove the opener Brathwaite for 91, the West Indies resistance began to crumble. The final 7 wickets fell for just 62 runs, leaving the West Indies 67 short of making New Zealand bat again.\n\n===91 v West Indies at Hamilton ''2017/18 NZ won by 240 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/17952/scorecard/1115794/new-zealand-vs-west-indies-2nd-test-wi-in-nz-2017-18/ Scorecard]\n\nThe West Indies were dealt a blow before the match had even begun. In the wake of extremely slow over rates and late finishes during the first test, as well as similar offences in previous tours, the Windies skipper Jason Holder was handed a one match suspension by the ICC. For the first time in the series, West Indies won the toss and elected to field first on what appeared to be a fairly benign Seddon Park surface. The pitch indeed appeared to be offering little movement for the bowlers and New Zealand seemed to be cruising at 156/1. However, after Williamson (43) gloved a delivery down the legside to the keeper, the West Indies were able to make inroads into the middle order. Raval (84) was batting steadily but wickets continued to fall at the other end, and the Kiwis were now struggling somewhat at 189/5. A fast fifty from de Grandhomme (58) was able to wrest some initiative back towards New Zealand, but when he fell shortly before the close of the first day the batting effort looked destined for a middling score. The tail did not fall cheaply, however, and an excellent 10th-wicket stand of 61 between Southee (31) and Boult (37*) frustrated the West Indies bowlers, who eventually dismissed New Zealand for 373.\n\nThe West Indies' response struggled to find any momentum, and despite some resistance from the tail they were able to muster only 221 in their first innings. Boult (4/73) bowled well, but was given a fair deal of assistance by the West Indies batsmen, particularly Sunil Ambris. Ambris, who stood on his stumps for the second time in three innings, had been dismissed first ball in a similar fashion on debut. With the benefit of a 152-run lead the New Zealanders made a confident start to their second innings. Williamson (54) made his way to an effortless half-century before being undone by an inswinging yorker. However, New Zealand's middle order woes continued, and they were largely carried through to 291/8 thanks to Taylor's 17th Test century (107*). This effort drew him level with both Williamson and his former mentor, the late Martin Crowe, and Taylor was noticeably emotional after the innings.\n\nWest Indies never looked remotely in contention to chase down the 444 runs required at any point during their innings. Boult (2/52) and Southee (2/71) bowled well at the outset to remove the top order. Aggressive short-pitched bowling from Wagner (3/42) battered and bruised the middle order, and Santner (2/13) chimed in to remove the tail, granting New Zealand a comfortable 240 run win and another 2-0 home series whitewash. Ambris' misfortunes continued as he was forced to retire hurt with a broken arm after being struck by another bouncer from Wagner.\n\n===92 v England at Auckland 2017/18 ''NZ won by an innings and 49 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10883/scorecard/1115780/new-zealand-vs-england-1st-test-eng-tour-of-aus-and-nz-2017-18/ Scorecard]\n\nIn the first day/night pink ball test in NZ, Williamson won the toss and elected to bowl. Led by Trent Boult who took 6 for 32, NZ produced one of the best days of test cricket in NZ's history. Boult and Southee (4/25) bowling unchanged dismissed England for 58.\n\nBoult and Southee coaxed plenty of swing and movement out of the pink ball and at one stage had reduced England to 8 for 23. NZ fans were hoping England might be dismissed for less than the record 26. However England's number nine top scored with 33* and England were all out for 58.\n\nThis was their sixth-lowest total in any Test match. Their previous lowest total against New Zealand was 64 in Wellington in 1977-78.\n\nLooking to pressing home the advantage, NZ batted responsibly but slowly. Jeet Raval scored 3 off 23 balls, Tom Latham 26 off 112, Ross Taylor 20 off 35, Henry Nicholls 24* off 67 and Kane Williamson 91* off 177. At the end of Day 1 NZ had scored 175 for the loss of 3 wickets meaning they were 119 ahead on the first innings with 7 wickets left. Only 26 overs were possible on the second and third days of the test. Williamson scored his 18th test century (102). This was a record for NZ, Ross Taylor and Martin Crowe both scored 17 centuries. Day 4 was fine and Nicholls scored his second test century (145*) and NZ declared at 427 for 8.\n\nNZ's declaration halfway through day four gave them about 140 overs to bowl England out. At the end of Day 4, England were 132 for 3, and Boult had 2 of those. On Day 5 the pitch was still playing well and most of England's batsmen got a start. Wagner (3 for 77) bounced out 3 batsmen, Boult took 3 for 67, and Todd Astle playing in his third test took 3 for 39. Boult was named man of the match for his match figures of 9 for 99. This was the 50 test match at Eden Park.\n\nAt the conclusion of this test Williamson was ranked the number 3 batsmen in the world and Ross Taylor was 11th. Boult was ranked the 7th best bowler, Wagner 8th and Tim Southee was 16th.\n \nAndrew McGlashan writing on Circinfo stated that \"Tim Southee, Trent Boult and Neil Wagner have formed a formidable trio over the last four years. They first played together in 2013 and have joined forces in 24 Tests, of which New Zealand have won 13\". Collectively they have taken 316 wickets at an average of 25.84.\n\nWhile NZ was crushing England at Eden Park, Australia was tampering with the ball at Cape Town. The resulting furore dominated headlines in the cricket world for weeks, and led to Steve Smith and David Warner being banned from international and Australian domestic cricket for 12 months. Cameron Bancroft, who actually did the tampering was banned for 9 months and Australia's coach Darren Lehman resigned taking responsibility for the culture in the team.\n\nThe second test of a 2 match series was drawn so NZ recorded their first series win over England since 1999, and their first at home since 1983-84. NZ batted 124.4 overs in the fourth innings of the second test and lost 8 wickets for 256 but managed to secure the draw.\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/10883/scorecard/1115781/new-zealand-vs-england-2nd-test-england-tour-of-australia-and-new-zealand-2017/ Scorecard ]\n\n===93 v Pakistan at Abu Dhabi 2018/19 (1st Test) ''NZ won by 4 runs''===\n\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18879/scorecard/1157381/new-zealand-vs-pakistan-1st-test-nz-in-uae-2018-19 Scorecard]\n\nIn the U.A.E the recipe for winning starts with win the toss, bat first and post a big score. [[Kane Williamson]] won the toss, and he scored 63 but NZ was all out for 153, the lowest-ever first-innings total in Abu Dhabi. The last 5 wicket fells for 30 runs.\n\n[[Trent Boult]] bowled beautifully when Pakistan batted, he kept NZ in the game by dismissing four of the top six Pakistani batsmen. Boult took 4 for 54. Pakistan only lost four wickets getting past NZ first innings score but another lower order collapse kept NZ in the game. The last 5 wicket fells for 50 runs. Pakistan's 227 means a first innings lead of 74. [[Tim Southee]] was replaced for this game by 30-year-old, debutant left arm spinner [[Ajaz Patel]]. [[Colin de Grandhomme]] opened the bowling with Boult\n\nNZ lost only 1 wicket wiping of the deficit and four of the top six made decent contributions. [[Jeet Raval]] got 46, Williamson 37, [[Henry Nicholls (cricketer)|Henry Nicholls]] 55 and [[BJ Watling]] 55. At 220 for 4 NZ were back in the test match but then NZ lost 6 for 29 in the third lower order collapse of the test match. The last 5 wicket fells for 25 runs. NZ's total of 249 gave Pakistan a target of 176 to win.\n\nPakistan started strongly and were into the forties before the first wicket fell. Luckily for NZ, their two spinners, [[Ish Sodhi]] and Patel picked up 3 quick wickets. [[Azhar Ali]], batting at 3 steadied the ship and Pakistan got to 130 before losing their 4th wicket. 51 to win with 6 wickets left. After lunch on the fourth day [[Babar Azam]] lost his head and ran himself out - 147 for 5 - and the panic set in. The captain played an ambitious sweep shot for a man on 3 and was caught behind - 154 for 6. Panic became hysteria. The number 8 slogged across the line and was bowled by Patel - 154 for 7. The number 9 chased a wide ball from [[Neil Wagner]] and got caught at Slip - 155 for 8. The number 9 slog-swept against the turn and was caught on the midwicket boundary - 164 for 9.\n\nOnly when the ninth wicket fell did Pakistan follow [[George Hirst]]'s advice from 1902 -   \"We'll get 'em in singles\". While Azhar Ali was on strike Williamson put most of the fielders on the boundary, Azhar would turn down an easy singles until the last couple of balls of the over. This continued for seven tense overs, before Patel bowled a beautiful ball that pitched on the leg stump and spun past Azhar's bat to hit him on the thigh in front of the off bail. The last 5 wicket fells for 24 runs.\nPatel was declared the man of the match. See the highlights of Pakistan's fourth innings here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jvuuMaKjSs\n\nStatistical highlights were:\n\n* Four innings and four lower order batting collapses.

Somerville made his first class debut for Otago in 2005 but played most of his 18 first class games for New South Wales.\n\nNZ won the toss and chose to bat first. They got off to a good start and were 70 for 1 at one stage but lost 3 quick wickets to the Pakistani spinners and ended up at 72 for 4. [[Kane Williamson]] and [[BJ Watling]] put on a 104 runs for the fifth wicket. After Williamson fell for 89 on Watling (77*) and the tail managed to score another 98 runs. However 274 batting first at Abu Dhabi was not a good first innings score.\n\nWhen Pakistan batted [[Trent Boult]] picked up 2 quick wickets but a fourth wicket partnership of 201 took Pakistan past NZ's first innings score. However the 2 NZ spinners [[Ajaz Patel]] and [[William Somerville (cricketer)|Will Somerville]] (4 for 75) dragged NZ back into the game. Nevertheless, NZ conceded a first innings lead of 74.\n\nThe NZ second inning started badly and at one stage NZ were 4 for 60, then Williamson and [[Henry Nicholls (cricketer)|Henry Nicholls]] put on 212 for the fifth wicket - a new record against Pakistan.\n\nThe run rate for the first 4 days had been a pedestrian 2.5 per over, but on the fifth day the test match leapt into life. At stumps on Day 4, NZ were 272 for 4 with Williamson on 139, Nicolls on 90 and NZ were 198 ahead of Pakistan. However overnight NZ had set their sight on victory. Williamson got out first ball of the day but Nicholls, de Grandhomme, and Southee sought quick runs and NZ scored 81 runs for the loss of 3 wickets in 9 overs. NZ declared at 353 for 7, Williamson top scored with 139 and Nicholls got 126*.\n\nPakistan's target was 280 off 79 overs. Southee and de Grandhomme picked up the first two wickets and then the spinners stepped up. Somerville got two wickets and Patel got one and at lunch on the fifth day, Pakistan were 55 for 5 and the game was over as a contest. Pakistan's last 5 wickets scored another 100 runs but the damage was too great to overcome. Southee took, 3 for 42, Patel 3 for 42 and Somerville on debut took 3 for 52 in the second innings and 7 for 127 in the match.\n\nThis victory over Pakistan gave the Black Caps their first away test series victory against Pakistan since the 1969. The victories in Abu Dhabi were split by a loss at Dubai.\n\nWilliamson scored 386 runs in 6 turns at bat at an average of 77.20. His career average at the end of the series was 51.56. Williamson's 228 runs in this test left him the second best ranked batsman in the world (913 pts) after [[Virat Kohli]] (920 pts).\n\n===95 v Sri Lanka at Christchurch 2018/19 ''NZ won by 423 runs''===\n[http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18812/scorecard/1153839/new-zealand-vs-sri-lanka-2nd-test-sri-lanka-in-nz-2018-19 Scorecard]\n\nSri Lanka won the toss and put NZ in on a green wicket. After 27.1 overs NZ were 64 for 6. Then [[BJ Watling]] (49) was joined by [[Tim Southee]] (68) and they put on 108 for the 7th wicket and got NZ through to 178. The Sri Lankan bowlers tied to bounce Southee out but three top edges went for six and two others for four. His 68 came off 65 balls. NZ's last four wickets fell for 6 runs.\n\nSri Lanka began their reply on Day 1 and [[Tim Southee]] picked up 3 quick wickets and [[Colin de Grandhomme]] 1 wicket. At the end of Day 1 Sri Lanka were 88 for 4 and the match was still in the balance.\n\nBut in the morning session of Day 2 everything fell apart for the Sri Lankans. [[Trent Boult]] bowled 4 overs and 2 balls and dismissed 6 batsmen for 10 runs. Southee bowled 4 overs but got no further wickets. Boult swung the ball and bowled straight and the last 4 Sri Lanka batsmen were all plumb lbw. Southee finished the innings with 3 for 35 and Boult got his best innings figures of 6 for 30. Sri Lanka were all out for 104.\n\nIn NZ's second turn at bat all the top six made valuable contributions. [[Jeet Raval]] got 74, and [[Tom Latham (cricketer)|Tom Latham]] 176. Raval and Latham scored their first century partnership (121) together and made life very easy for the batsmen to follow. [[Kane Williamson]] got 48, and [[Ross Taylor]] 40. By the time [[Henry Nicholls (cricketer)|Henry Nicholls]] came to the crease NZ were 247 for 3 and Sri Lanka's target was already 321. Nicholls and Latham added 214 together. When Latham departed for 176 [[Colin de Grandhomme]], was promoted ahead of Watling, and scored NZ's fastest test 50 off 28 balls on his way to 71*. Nicholls (162*) and de Grandhomme added 124 runs at 8.55 runs an over.\n\nWilliamson declared at 585 for 4, leaving Sri Lanka to bat for about an hour and a quarter on Day 3 and all of Day 4 & 5 to save the match or score a world record 660 to win.\n\nIn Sri Lanka's second innings both Boult and Southee picked up an opener each in their first overs. Both openers chased wide balls they should have left and were caught by Watling and Sri Lanka were 24 for 2 at the end of day 3.\n\nSri Lanka fought hard on day four, seeing out the early swing and seam of Trent Boult and Tim Southee. As usual Wagner bowled rib ticklers and finally broke the 318-ball third wicket stand. In the evening session Wagner got 2 more wickets, one of which was with a throat-high bouncer. [[Angelo Mathews]] also pulled a ham string, retired hurt, and did not bat again. Sri Lanka did well to take the game into the fifth day and stumps were drawn with Sri Lanka at 231/6.\n\nNZ required just 14 balls on day 5 to finish of the Sri Lankan innings. Wagner bounced out one of those and Boult picked up the other 2 wickets. Boult took 3 for 77 and Wagner 4 for 48.\n\nBoult's match figures were 9 for 107, but Southee was the player of the match for rescuing NZ with the bat in the first innings with his top score of 68 and match figures of 5 for 96.\n\nThe victory was NZ'S largest victory in terms of runs.\n\nThis was a record fourth consecutive series win for New Zealand. NZ beat the West Indies and England at home last summer, and defeated Pakistan in the UAE in November 2018.\n\nAfter Sri Lanka unexpectedly beat South Africa in South Africa 2 nil, NZ moved to number 2 in the ICC test rankings behind India.\n\nThe four consecutive series victories were as a result of experienced and performing batsmen and pace bowlers and a decent spinner or two when the pitch was turning.\n\nThe career averages for the top seven regulars in the batting order at the end of this test were as follows:\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!  !!Tests !!

Given that NZ had an experienced and talented team no one fancied the Bangladeshis chances of stopping another series victory.\n\nWilliamson won the toss and put the Bangladeshis in on a well grassed surface. However NZ bowled poorly and [[Tamim Iqbal]] flayed the new ball around Seddon Park. Bangladeshi were 121 for 1 at lunch. After lunch Wagner's short pitched bowling finally paid dividends, he took all five of his wicket with short balls. 5 for 47 was his sixth five-wicket haul in Tests. [[Tim Southee]] got 3 for 76. 234 all out was a very poor return on a good batting surface.\n\nNZ batted for 28 overs and by the end of Day 1 [[Jeet Raval]] and [[Tom Latham (cricketer)|Tom Latham]] had added 86 without loss. On Day 2, Ravel scored 132 and Latham 161. Their 1st wicket partnership of 254 was the third highest in NZ's Test history. NZ scored 365 runs on day 2 for the loss of only 4 wickets. Williamson was unbeaten on 93 at the close.\n\nOn Day 3, [[Neil Wagner]] batting at six, as a night watchman smashed 47 off 35 balls. [[Colin de Grandhomme]] smashed 76 of 53 balls. Williamson declared on 715 for 6 when he completed his double century.\n\nStatistical highlights were:\n\n*715 was NZ highest ever innings score\n*It was the 17th highest innings total of all time.\n*This was only the second time the top 3 batsmen for NZ had all scored centuries.\n*Ravel scored his maiden Test century\n*Wagner got his top score.\n*200* was Williamson's second double century\n*Williamson became the first NZer to score 20 Test centuries.\n*Williamson was the 16th fastest batsman ever to reach 6000 runs.\n*After this innings Williamson's test average was 53.20.\n\nThe declaration midway through Day 3 left Bangladesh 2 and a half days to bat. After an opening partnership of 88, Wagner ramped up the short balls, and the verbals. Bangladesh lost 4 wickets in 8 overs. They ended Day 3 on 174 for 4 chasing 481 to force NZ to bat again. The only mystery left in the game was how quickly they would be dismissed on Day 4.\n\nOn Day 4, the number 5 and 6 Bangladeshi batsmen combined in a partnership of 235. After 80 overs Bangladesh were 344 for 4. When Boult and Southee took the new ball they got some swing and 4 overs later Boult broke the partnership. None of the last 5 batsmen scored more than 4 runs and Bangladeshi finished with 429 of 103 overs. Boult got 5 for 123 and Southee 3 for 98. [[Todd Astle]] was the spinner for this match but failed to pick up a wicket.\n\n===97 v Bangladesh at Wellington 2018/19 ''NZ won by an innings and 12 runs''===\n\n[https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/18805/scorecard/1153848/new-zealand-vs-bangladesh-2nd-test-bangladesh-in-nz-2018-19 Scorecard]\n\nThe first two days were ruined by rain and the Test did not start until the third day.\n\nWilliamson won the toss and not surprisingly chose to bowl on a pitch as green as the outfield. However, like in the first test, NZ bowled poorly and the Bangladeshi openers put on 75 for the first wicket. It wasn't until the 32nd over before [[Neil Wagner]]'s short pitched bowling started to pay dividends.   He dismissed the number 3, 4 and opening batsmen in 4 overs and Bangladesh were 134 for 4. Bangladesh struggled through to 206 before [[Trent Boult]] and [[Tim Southee]] picked up the last 4 wickets for 5 runs. Wagner finished with 4 for 28 and Boult 3 for 38.\n\nWhen NZ batted, there was still plenty of seam in the green pitch for accurate bowlers and NZ lost both their openers early.  [[Kane Williamson]] and [[Ross Taylor]] were forced to steady the ship after the openers were dismissed early. When the rain rolled in, NZ were 38 for 2, and Bangladesh still in the game.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth day, Williamson and Taylor were troubled early but slowly wrestled control of the game away from Bangladesh. As there were only 2 days left in the game the NZ batsmen knew they had to score quickly. Williamson got 74 of 105 balls and he put on 180 with Taylor in 31 overs, at 5.55 runs an over. Nichols joined Taylor and scored 107 off 129 balls and they put on 216 in 40 overs at 5.4 runs an over.\n\nNichols century was his fifth and Taylor's 200 was his 18th century. Only Williamson with 20 has scored more for NZ. Williamson declared at 432 for 6 off 84.5 overs. (5.09 runs per over)\n\nThe declaration left Bangladesh 23 overs to bat before stump. Boult bowled one opener with the second ball of the innings and got the second opener in his 4th over. [[Matt Henry (cricketer)|Matt Henry]] bounced out a third batsman and Bangladesh were 80 for 3 at stumps and 141 in arrears.\n\nBangladesh got through 14 overs for the loss of only 1 wicket and then Wagner came on. The Bangladeshis had no answer to Wagner's unique bowling. Short pitch bowling at the batsman's ribs and throat got 4 out his 5 wickets and Bangladesh only managed 209 runs. Wagner got 5 for 45 and Boult 4 for 52. This was Wagner's 7th five-wicket haul in Test cricket and his match figures of 9 for 73 were a career best.\n\nThe third test of the series was called off following a terrorist attack on two mosques in Christchurch. Some of the Bangladeshi players were on the way to one of the mosques for Friday prayers when the attack began. The Australian terrorist murdered 51 people.\n\nBoth the batting and bowling averages of the 10 regular players over the 5 consecutive victorious Test series were outstanding.\n\nBatting Averages:\n{| class=wikitable\n!  !!Tests !!

Both tests were badly affected by monsoon rain but both ended in a result.\n\nThe ICC had just introduced the World Test Championship which allows a team to gain a maximum of 120 points per series. As this was a 2 test series each test victory was worth 60 points.  (Each test victory in a 5 match series is worth 24)\n\nThe monsoon rain reduced the three-day practice game to one day.\nNZ lost the first test in Galle bringing their five consecutive test series victory winning streak to an end.\nMonsoon rain and bad light reduced the 2nd test of the series to 275 overs (out of a possible 450).\n\nSri Lanka won the toss and chose to bat on greenish pitch.\nNZ did not pick Neil Wagner for this test but chose two spinners Will Somerville and Ajaz Patel.\nOnly 36 overs were possible on the first day and Boult and Southee did not get any wickets on day one. Sri Lanka finished at 84/2.\n\nOn Day 2, Boult got 2 wickets in the 41st over. The first of these was his 250 test wicket for NZ.\nSouthee got 2 wickets in the 57th over and Sri Lanka were 130 for 6. Then the rain washed out the rest of the days play after only 30 more overs.\n\nOn Day 3, Sri Lanka were still batting in their first innings. It took a further 23 overs for NZ to bowl them out for 244. Southee got 4 for 63.\n\nNZ started their first innings just before midday on day 3. \nAfter 43 overs they were 126 for 4. Then Latham (154) and Watling (109*) combined in a 143 run partnership for the fifth wicket.\nChasing quick runs de Grandhomme scored 83 of 69 balls and NZ ended Day 4 ahead by 138 runs.\n\nOn Day 5 NZ batted on for a very eventful 5 overs. In that time, de Grandhomme was out without adding to his overnight score, BJ Watling brought up his seventh test century and became NZ's highest-scoring wicketkeeper in Test cricket and Southee smashed 24 of 10 balls.\nSri Lanka had to survive most of day 5 to draw the game. They did not begin well and lost their first 5 wickets for 32 runs in 22 overs. Later Southee picked up his 250th test wicket for NZ as well.\n\nWhen the final session began, Sri Lanka still needed to bat out 36 overs to salvage a draw with three wickets in hand.\n26 overs later Sri Lanka had not lost a further wicket and the light was beginning to fade. Somerville finally got the breakthrough and then 4 overs later Patel got the penultimate wicket. 5 balls later at 4:44 pm Boult bounced out the last batsman and NZ squared the series and picked up 60 points in the World Test Championship table. 20 minutes later it was too dark to play.\n \nLatham was the player of the match for his 154 and Watling was awarded man of the series for sores of 1, 77 and 105*.\n\nIn the ICC cricket world cup, Williamson scored for 578 runs at 82.57 and was awarded the player of the tournament. In Sri Lanka a month later, Williamson only scored 24 runs in three turns at bat and was sent home to NZ for a rest and did not play in the limited over games.\nTwo months after the world cup final Williamson said \"Has it been a month has it? Feels like yesterday.\" and \"some members of his team are still trying to make sense of their heart-breaking World Cup final 'loss'.<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/black-caps/115762607/feels-like-yesterday-world-cup-final-loss-still-raw-for-kane-williamson</ref> By mid October the boundary count back rule that handed England the title of World Cup champion was abolished by the International Cricket Council.\n\n=== 99 v England at Mount Maunganui 2019/20 ''NZ won by an innings and 65 runs'' ===\nMount Maunganui hosted its first ever Test in the series opener against England. It was to be an auspicious debut.\n\nAfter winning the toss, England elected to bat first on what appeared to be a fairly lifeless wicket. The slow surface proved difficult for both batting and bowling, and old-fashioned attritional cricket became the order of the day. The New Zealand attack, while disciplined enough, were unable to make any decisive inroads into the English batting order on the first day. Despite the cheap dismissal of skipper Joe Root, the tourists finished at 241/4 at stumps on day 1, with NZ's World Cup nemesis Ben Stokes looking ominous on 67*. Several of the England top order batsmen got themselves set, including Joe Denly (79) and opener Rory Burns (52), but were unable to push on to truly big totals. When Stokes (91) fell the next day, courtesy of a blinder at slip from Ross Taylor, the lower order largely disintegrated and the innings lost its way. Only an attacking innings by wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler (43) and some stubborn resistance from well-known nightwatchman Jack Leach (18*) saw England drag themselves through to 353. Tim Southee registered the best bowling figures, taking 4 for 88. Neil Wagner also displayed his penchant for creating opportunities out of unhelpful conditions, and his aggressive short-pitched bowling yielded him 3 for 90. \n\nIt seemed to be a competitive score, and looked to be formidable when the New Zealand innings stalled at 127/4. New Zealand middle order veterans Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor appeared to be accumulating runs with relative ease, before Taylor (25) scooped a rank long hop to deep square leg. Williamson (51) fell victim to one of the few deliveries that did anything remotely unexpected, with a delivery from Sam Curran rearing up off a length and taking a glove through to the keeper. Henry Nicholls (41) played confidently, but when he fell with the score on 197, NZ were struggling and appeared destined for a sub-300 score. A lower-order rally, led by keeper BJ Watling, slowly but surely resuscitated the NZ first innings. Two crucial partnerships - 119 with Colin de Grandhomme (63) and a mammoth 261 with maiden centurion Mitchell Santner (126) - allowed the gritty keeper-batsman to help push the game out of England's reach. Watling himself made a career-best 205, a marathon innings lasting over 11 hours (667 minutes). By the time Williamson eventually declared on 615/9, with a lead of 262 runs, England had been kept out in the field for a whopping 201 overs.\n\nThe tourists were left with the unenviable task of batting out just under four sessions to save the match. By stumps on the fourth day, however, they had been reduced to 55/3 by some canny slow left-arm bowling from Santner, and looked unlikely to avoid an innings defeat. Resistance from Stokes and Denly on the final day left some New Zealand supporters wondering if their hopes of victory were to be denied at the last moment yet again. When Southee prompted Stokes to drag a wide delivery onto his stumps, midway through the last session, England lost their last hope of a draw. The way was cleared for Wagner, who proceeded to run through the relatively weak England tail. Wagner eventually picked up 5 for 44, and England had succumbed to defeat at 197 - 65 runs short of making NZ bat again. \n\nBroken records abounded in Mount Maunganui's inaugural Test. Watling's stirling double century made him the ninth wicketkeeper - and first for New Zealand - to achieve the feat. His partnership of 261 with Santner was also the highest in NZ Test history for the 7th wicket, and the team's first innings total of 615 was their highest against England.\n\nAt the end of this test the career batting averages for six of New Zealand's top seven batsmen averaged over 40. Kane Williamson 52.21, Ross Taylor 46.37, Henry Nicholls 44.16, Tom Latham 43.57, BJ Watling 40.51 and Colin de Grandhomme 40.33.\n\nThe career averages of New Zealand's pace bowlers were all under 30. Trent Boult 27.64, Tim Southee 29.89, Neil Wagner 27.04 and Colin de Grandhomme 29.63.\n\nWagner's 8 for 134 in the match propelled him to number 3 in the ICC Player ratings for bowlers.\n\nUnfortunately points for the series were not up for grabs in the World Test Championship.\n\n=== 100 v India at Wellington 2019/20 ''NZ won by 10 wickets'' ===\nThis was [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]]'s 100th test victory. \n\nIndia went into this series ranked the number one test side in the world. New Zealand on the other hand had just finished a test series against Australia that they lost 3-0. The mauling in Australia led to the end of Jeet Raval's test career and Mitchel Santner dropped as NZ's spinner.  However it was NZ that comprehensively outplayed India in this match.\n\nWilliamson won the toss and choose to bowl on a greenish looking pitch.\n\n\n=== 101 v India at Christchurch 2019/20 ''NZ won by 7 wickets'' ===\n\n==New Zealand Test Dream Team==\n\nThe following team was chosen by [[Richard Boock]], [[Donald Cameron (cricketer)|Don Cameron]], [[Dylan Cleaver]], [[Ross Dykes]], [[David Leggat]], [[Jonathan Millmow]], [[John Morrison (cricketer)|John Morrison]], [[Don Neely]], [[Joseph Romanos]], [[Bryan Waddle]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/429142.html|title=David Leggat on New Zealand's all-time XI \u2013  Cricket  \u2013 ESPN Cricinfo|work=Cricinfo|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n*1 [[Glenn Turner]] played in 6 victories\n*2 [[Stewie Dempster]] played in 0 victories\n*3 [[Bert Sutcliffe]] played in 0 victories\n*4 [[Martin Crowe]] played in 16 victories\n*5 [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]] played in 0 victories\n*6 [[John Richard Reid|John Reid]] played in 3 victories\n*7 [[Daniel Vettori]] played in 34 victories\n*8 [[Richard Hadlee]] played in 22 victories\n*9 [[Ian Smith (New Zealand cricketer)|Ian Smith]] played in 16 victories\n*10 [[Shane Bond]] played in 10 victories\n*11 [[Jack Cowie]] played in 0 victories\n\nThe following team was chosen by [[Joseph Romanos]] in 2008:\n*1 [[Glenn Turner]] played in 6 victories\n*2 [[Stewie Dempster]] played in 0 victories\n*3 [[Andrew Jones (cricketer, born 1959)|Andrew Jones]] played in 6 victories\n*4 [[Martin Crowe]] played in 16 victories\n*5 [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]] played in 0 victories\n*6 [[John Richard Reid|John Reid]] played in 3 victories\n*7 [[Richard Hadlee]] played in 22 victories\n*8 [[Ian Smith (New Zealand cricketer)|Ian Smith]] played in 16 victories\n*9 [[Shane Bond]] played in 10 victories\n*10 [[Clarrie Grimmett]] played in 0 tests for New Zealand but 20 test victories for Australia\n*11 [[Jack Cowie]] played in 0 victories\n*12 [[Alexander Downes]] played in 0 victories\n\nThe following team was chosen by [[Harry Ricketts]] in 2006:\n*1 [[Glenn Turner]] played in 6 victories\n*2 [[Bert Sutcliffe]] played in 0 victories\n*3 [[Stephen Fleming]] played in 31 victories\n*4 [[Martin Crowe]] played in 16 victories\n*5 [[Martin Donnelly (cricketer)|Martin Donnelly]] played in 0 victories\n*6 [[John Richard Reid|John Reid]] played in 3 victories\n*7 [[Chris Cairns]] played in 16 victories\n*8 [[Richard Hadlee]] played in 22 victories\n*9 [[Ian Smith (New Zealand cricketer)|Ian Smith]] played in 16 victories\n*10 [[Daniel Vettori]] played in 34 victories\n*11 [[Jack Cowie]] played in 0 victories\n\nThe following team was chosen by [[Tom Reese|T.

It is almost due south of the city of [[Rijeka]] and part of the [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].\n\nThe settlements on Lo\u0161inj include [[Nerezine]], [[Sveti Jakov]], [[\u0106unski]], [[Artatore]], [[Mali Lo\u0161inj]] and [[Veli Lo\u0161inj]].\n\nA regional road runs the length of the island; ferry connections (via the island of [[Cres]]) include [[Brestova]] - [[Porozina]], [[Merag]] - [[Valbiska]], Mali Lo\u0161inj - [[Zadar]], Mali Lo\u0161inj - [[Pula]]. There is also an airport on the island of Lo\u0161inj.\n\n==Geography==\nLo\u0161inj is part of the Cres-Lo\u0161inj archipelago. The Cres-Lo\u0161inj archipelago includes Cres and Lo\u0161inj, and the smaller islands of [[Unije]], [[Ilovik]], [[Susak]], [[Vele Srakane]], [[Male Srakane]] and a number of uninhabited small islands.  Cres is the biggest by area, Lo\u0161inj is second.  [[Cres]] and Lo\u0161inj are connected by a small bridge at the town of [[Osor, Croatia|Osor]] on Cres. The highest elevations are the mountains Televrin (also called Osor\u0161\u0107ica) at {{convert|588|m|0|abbr=on}} and Sv. Nikola (also called Sv. Mikul) at {{convert|557|m|0|abbr=on}}.  The towns of Nerezine and Sveti Jakov lie at their base.  The island is formed predominantly of chalk [[limestone]] and [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] rocks.  There are sand deposits in the western part of the Kurila peninsula.\n\nLo\u0161inj is the 11th largest Adriatic island by area, {{convert|33|km|0|abbr=on}} long, with the width varying from {{convert|4.75|km|2|abbr=on}} in the north and middle of the island, to {{convert|0.25|km|2|abbr=on}} near the town of Mali Lo\u0161inj.

However, as with other Mediterranean locations, Losinj is susceptible to the various [[List of local winds|Winds]]. [[Bora (wind)|Bura]] is the north-easterly wind that brings low temperatures and strong winds, sometimes it is strong enough to turn over heavy vehicles. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2015/03/06/hurricane-bura-winds-adriatic/|title=Hurricane-strength bura winds flip trucks in Croatia|last=Schroeder|first=Stan|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> [[Sirocco|Jugo]] is the southerly wind that originated from the [[Sahara]], when it reaches Losinj it becomes wet, then brings along dark clouds and stormy weather.

Veli Lo\u0161inj, [[\u010cikat]] and the south-western coast are ringed by [[pine]] forests.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Veli Losinj Town Harbor.jpg|thumb|270px|The old town of Veli Lo\u0161inj]]\nSettlement on nearby Cres is known to date back around 12,000 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puntakriza.com/hist-eng.htm |title=Uvala Ul, Punta Kriza, Croatia, History |publisher=Puntakriza.com |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> and the island of Lo\u0161inj is also thought to have been inhabited since prehistoric times.  This is evidenced by hill-forts at the foot of Osor\u0161\u0107ica and around the port of Mali Lo\u0161inj. According to [[Ptolemy]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called this island ''Apsorrus'' ({{lang-grc|\u1f0c\u03c8\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2)}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/15*.html |title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Ptolemy's Geography \u2014 Book II, Chapter 15 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> and referred to the islands of Lo\u0161inj and [[Cres]] collectively as ''[[Apsirtides]]''. In several places, ruins of Roman villas have been excavated (villae rusticae: Liski, Sveti Jakov, and Studen\u010di\u0107 near [[\u0106unski]]). Several small eremitic churches dating from the Roman era have been preserved (St. Lovre\u0107 near Osor, and St. James in Sveti Jakov).In the Middle Ages, Lo\u0161inj was the property of the clerical and secular nobility of Osor and unpopulated.\n\nThe first evidence of settlers from the mainland was in 1280. Pursuant to a contract with [[Osor, Croatia|Osor]], their settlements gained self-governance in 1389. The name Lo\u0161inj was first mentioned in 1384. Parallel with the gradual decline of Osor from the 15th century onwards, the settlements Veli Lo\u0161inj and Mali Lo\u0161inj played an increasingly important role.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, trade, shipbuilding and seafaring on the island developed more intensely. In 1771, [[Alberto Fortis]] visited Cres and Lo\u0161inj (which was then called '''Osero''') and wrote a travelogue about his visit: ''Saggio d'osservazioni sopra l'isola di Cherso ed Osero.''<ref>http://www.kartografija.hr/old_hkd/hrvkart/fortise.htm</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Saggio d'osservazioni sopra l'isola di Cherso ed Osero|author=Fortis, Alberto|year=1771|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c44U8T6_3vcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Saggio+d%27osservazioni+sopra+l%27isola+di+Cherso+ed+Ossero&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivvZfVgO3cAhVmjVQKHTX2C4sQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Saggio%20d'osservazioni%20sopra%20l'isola%20di%20Cherso%20ed%20Ossero&f=false|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref> After the fall of the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1797, Lo\u0161inj became part of the [[Austria\u2013Hungary|Austrian]] province ([[crown land]]) of Istria under the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]].  By 1900 the population had reached 11,615.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Lussin|volume=17|page=131}}</ref> In 1921, it was given as 15,000.<ref>{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Lussin|year=1921}}</ref>\n\nIn 1919, Lo\u0161inj, with its partially Italian population, became part of [[Italy]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]], as confirmed by the 1920 [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]]. It was held by them until 1943 when it was occupied by [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] and [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]]n troops during [[World War II]] as part of the [[Operational Zone Adriatic Coast]]. In 1945 the island and the rest of Croatia became part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], until [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|Croatia declared independence]] from the Yugoslav Federation in 1991.\n\nThe post-Second World War period saw a substantial exodus (see [[Istrian exodus]] for further details) of its [[Italian language|Italian-speaking]] population to Italy and to other countries. According to the last census the number of Italian-speaking citizens in Lo\u0161inj were 557 (6.64% of the total official resident population). Before the independence of Croatia from the Yugoslav Federation, the official censuses reported the Italian-speaking minority being much smaller (figures quoted in the official census conducted in 1981 shows that the Italian minority accounted only for 1.5% of the resident population).\nExpatriates in Italy and around the world publish a newsletter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lussinpiccolo-italia.net |title=Home |publisher=www.lussinpiccolo-italia.net |date=2011-12-21 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> which keeps their memories and traditions alive.\nOn the Island Italian is popular as a second language.\n\nBecause of its temperate climate, aside from the violent Mediterranean Winds, since 2010, Losinj has started to become a tourist destination.

It is almost due south of the city of [[Rijeka]] and part of the [[Primorje-Gorski Kotar County]].\n\nThe settlements on Lo\u0161inj include [[Nerezine]], [[Sveti Jakov]], [[\u0106unski]], [[Artatore]], [[Mali Lo\u0161inj]] and [[Veli Lo\u0161inj]].\n\nA regional road runs the length of the island; ferry connections (via the island of [[Cres]]) include [[Brestova]] - [[Porozina]], [[Merag]] - [[Valbiska]], Mali Lo\u0161inj - [[Zadar]], Mali Lo\u0161inj - [[Pula]]. There is also an airport on the island of Lo\u0161inj.\n\n==Geography==\nLo\u0161inj is part of the Cres-Lo\u0161inj archipelago. The Cres-Lo\u0161inj archipelago includes Cres and Lo\u0161inj, and the smaller islands of [[Unije]], [[Ilovik]], [[Susak]], [[Vele Srakane]], [[Male Srakane]] and a number of uninhabited small islands.  Cres is the biggest by area, Lo\u0161inj is second.  [[Cres]] and Lo\u0161inj are connected by a small bridge at the town of [[Osor, Croatia|Osor]] on Cres. The highest elevations are the mountains Televrin (also called Osor\u0161\u0107ica) at {{convert|588|m|0|abbr=on}} and Sv. Nikola (also called Sv. Mikul) at {{convert|557|m|0|abbr=on}}.  The towns of Nerezine and Sveti Jakov lie at their base.  The island is formed predominantly of chalk [[limestone]] and [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] rocks.  There are sand deposits in the western part of the Kurila peninsula.\n\nLo\u0161inj is the 11th largest Adriatic island by area, {{convert|33|km|0|abbr=on}} long, with the width varying from {{convert|4.75|km|2|abbr=on}} in the north and middle of the island, to {{convert|0.25|km|2|abbr=on}} near the town of Mali Lo\u0161inj.

[[Bora (wind)|Bura]] is the north-easterly wind that brings low temperatures and strong winds, sometimes it is strong enough to turn over heavy vehicles. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mashable.com/2015/03/06/hurricane-bura-winds-adriatic/|title=Hurricane-strength bura winds flip trucks in Croatia|last=Schroeder|first=Stan|website=Mashable|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> [[Sirocco|Jugo]] is the southerly wind that originated from the [[Sahara]], when it reaches Losinj it becomes wet, then brings along dark clouds and stormy weather.

Veli Lo\u0161inj, [[\u010cikat]] and the south-western coast are ringed by [[pine]] forests.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Veli Losinj Town Harbor.jpg|thumb|270px|The old town of Veli Lo\u0161inj]]\nSettlement on nearby Cres is known to date back around 12,000 years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.puntakriza.com/hist-eng.htm |title=Uvala Ul, Punta Kriza, Croatia, History |publisher=Puntakriza.com |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> and the island of Lo\u0161inj is also thought to have been inhabited since prehistoric times.  This is evidenced by hill-forts at the foot of Osor\u0161\u0107ica and around the port of Mali Lo\u0161inj. According to [[Ptolemy]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] called this island ''Apsorrus'' ({{lang-grc|\u1f0c\u03c8\u03bf\u03c1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2)}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Periods/Roman/_Texts/Ptolemy/2/15*.html |title=LacusCurtius \u2022 Ptolemy's Geography \u2014 Book II, Chapter 15 |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> and referred to the islands of Lo\u0161inj and [[Cres]] collectively as ''[[Apsirtides]]''. In several places, ruins of Roman villas have been excavated (villae rusticae: Liski, Sveti Jakov, and Studen\u010di\u0107 near [[\u0106unski]]). Several small eremitic churches dating from the Roman era have been preserved (St. Lovre\u0107 near Osor, and St. James in Sveti Jakov).In the Middle Ages, Lo\u0161inj was the property of the clerical and secular nobility of Osor and unpopulated.\n\nThe first evidence of settlers from the mainland was in 1280. Pursuant to a contract with [[Osor, Croatia|Osor]], their settlements gained self-governance in 1389. The name Lo\u0161inj was first mentioned in 1384. Parallel with the gradual decline of Osor from the 15th century onwards, the settlements Veli Lo\u0161inj and Mali Lo\u0161inj played an increasingly important role.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, trade, shipbuilding and seafaring on the island developed more intensely. In 1771, [[Alberto Fortis]] visited Cres and Lo\u0161inj (which was then called '''Osero''') and wrote a travelogue about his visit: ''Saggio d'osservazioni sopra l'isola di Cherso ed Osero.''<ref>http://www.kartografija.hr/old_hkd/hrvkart/fortise.htm</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Saggio d'osservazioni sopra l'isola di Cherso ed Osero|author=Fortis, Alberto|year=1771|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c44U8T6_3vcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Saggio+d%27osservazioni+sopra+l%27isola+di+Cherso+ed+Ossero&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwivvZfVgO3cAhVmjVQKHTX2C4sQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=Saggio%20d'osservazioni%20sopra%20l'isola%20di%20Cherso%20ed%20Ossero&f=false|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}</ref> After the fall of the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1797, Lo\u0161inj became part of the [[Austria\u2013Hungary|Austrian]] province ([[crown land]]) of Istria under the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]].  By 1900 the population had reached 11,615.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Lussin|volume=17|page=131}}</ref> In 1921, it was given as 15,000.<ref>{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Lussin|year=1921}}</ref>\n\nIn 1919, Lo\u0161inj, with its partially Italian population, became part of [[Italy]] under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]], as confirmed by the 1920 [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Treaty of Rapallo]]. It was held by them until 1943 when it was occupied by [[Wehrmacht|German Wehrmacht]] and [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]]n troops during [[World War II]] as part of the [[Operational Zone Adriatic Coast]]. In 1945 the island and the rest of Croatia became part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], until [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|Croatia declared independence]] from the Yugoslav Federation in 1991.\n\nThe post-Second World War period saw a substantial exodus (see [[Istrian exodus]] for further details) of its [[Italian language|Italian-speaking]] population to Italy and to other countries. According to the last census the number of Italian-speaking citizens in Lo\u0161inj were 557 (6.64% of the total official resident population). Before the independence of Croatia from the Yugoslav Federation, the official censuses reported the Italian-speaking minority being much smaller (figures quoted in the official census conducted in 1981 shows that the Italian minority accounted only for 1.5% of the resident population).\nExpatriates in Italy and around the world publish a newsletter<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lussinpiccolo-italia.net |title=Home |publisher=www.lussinpiccolo-italia.net |date=2011-12-21 |accessdate=2013-03-26}}</ref> which keeps their memories and traditions alive.\nOn the Island Italian is popular as a second language.\n\nBecause of its temperate climate, aside from the violent Mediterranean Winds, since 2010, Losinj has started to become a tourist destination. Some Russian powers and conglomerates have invested in properties on the Island.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.russia.hr/en/hrvatski-losinjska-jadranka-u-rukama-ruskih-bankara/|title=Lo\u0161injska Jadranka u rukama ruskih bankaraLo\u0161inj's Jadranka in hands of Russian bankers|date=2013-12-10|website=Russia.hr|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/5917-pals-prosper-from-proximity-to-putin-s-power|title=Pals Prosper from Proximity to Putin\u2019s Power|last=OCCRP|first=Roman Shleynov|website=www.occrp.org|language=en|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref> Such activities have caused alarm on some of the locals. \n\n==People and art==\n* [[Agostino Straulino]] (b. 10 October 1914 in Mali Lo\u0161inj; d. 14 December 2004 in [[Rome]]) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Sailing|sailor]] and sailboat racer, who won one Olympic gold medal at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] (Helsinki) and one silver medal at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] (Melbourne) in the [[Star (sailboat)|Star class]], and eight consecutive European championships (1949\u201356) and two world championships (1952\u201353) in this class and was world champion in the 5.5m-class.

The player controls a laser cannon that can scroll left or right along a flat plane in order to target falling objects, such as large or small meteors, large or small spinning bombs, and guided missiles, as well as a UFO that crosses the screen from time to time at higher levels.<ref name=\"WeissCHVG\" />  Low hills and stars are seen in the background.  Unlike in ''Space Invaders'', the player does not face direct enemy fire, cannot hide beneath bunkers, and the game does not end when targets hit the ground.<ref name=\"Astrosmash\"/>\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:AstrosmashGP.jpg|thumb|left|A laser cannon defends the Earth from a [[meteor shower]].]]\nThere are four types of targets, each of which may move at a range of speeds.  As the game advances, the range of speeds for each type of target increases.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\">''Astrosmash'' Cartridge Instructions, [[Mattel]] Inc. (1981).</ref>\n\n*The bulk of the targets are meteors, which come in two sizes and various colors.  Both sizes fall vertically when entering the screen.  Large meteors may be destroyed with a direct hit, or may split into two smaller meteors, which fall diagonally in opposite directions.  Small meteors are destroyed with a single hit.\n*The player must also shoot spinning bombs, or spinners, which are white, come in two sizes, and spin while falling vertically.  Each spinner emits a loud whistling sound, which gradually lowers in pitch as it approaches the ground.\n*Guided missiles appear occasionally as white dots making a pulsing sound, and may fall diagonally toward the player's initial location, or track the laser cannon as it moves left and right.  If a missile reaches the ground, it may disappear, or it may continue to track left or right, and can only be avoided by entering [[hyperspace]].  The missile may change directions several times before disappearing.\n*UFOs may cross the screen occasionally, beginning at level 4, firing non-guided salvos aimed at the player's laser cannon.\n\nThe player loses a laser cannon each time it is hit by a falling meteor, a guided missile, a non-guided salvo, or by shrapnel from a nearby explosion, and any time a spinner reaches the ground, even if it does not strike the gun.  Each target hit increases the player's score; it decreases by half as much each time a meteor reaches the ground, or a laser cannon is destroyed.  An extra gun is awarded each time the player's peak score increases by 1,000 points.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\nThe game has six levels, each of which features increased speed and scoring.  Each level is represented by a differently-colored background.  Level 1, up to 999 points, is black; level 2, from 1,000 to 4,999 points, is blue; level 3, from 5,000 to 19,999 points, is purple; level 4, from 20,000 to 49,999 points, is turquoise; level 5, from 50,000 to 99,999 points, is gray; and level 6, above 100,000 points, is black again.  Speed continues to increase along with the player's peak score, at 200,000, 500,000, and 1,000,000 points.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\nThe player has the option of firing single shots by pressing the fire buttons, or switching to automatic fire at a rate of three shots per second.  The hyperspace option moves the gun to a random location, which may or may not be safer than the starting point.  The game can also be paused at any time.<ref name=\"Astrosmash Manual\"/>\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Intellivision - gi 1326971.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Intellivision Master Component, with ''Astrosmash'' loaded and an ''Astrosmash'' overlay on the left controller.]]\n''Astrosmash'' was originally conceived when a game called ''Meteor!'', an ''Asteroids'' clone, did not fill up the ROM space of an entire cartridge.

The suite consists of two main products: [[#PlayOn Cloud|PlayOn Cloud]] and [[#PlayOn Desktop|PlayOn Desktop]]. PlayOn Cloud is an online service for recording digital video streams, accessible via native [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile device applications. PlayOn Desktop is [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based software that acts as a streaming dashboard and hub on the PC. The available streaming websites are organized as channels in both products. Users browse through or search the video content found in those channels in order to record the videos for later viewing. PlayOn Desktop allows watching the videos real-time on the PC, or casting the videos to a TV via a streaming device or gaming console.\n\nThe recording feature of PlayOn acts as a [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] for streaming videos, creating an [[MPEG-4]] file which can be transferred to supported media devices. Users are then able to watch these videos without necessitating access to the Internet. The recording functionality inserts chapter marks at the locations of advertisements, allowing users to automatically skip commercials when watching via a native companion applications, directly in the PlayOn Desktop player on a PC, or via a variety of other DLNA-compliant media devices.\n\n==Software==\n\n===PlayOn Cloud===\n\nIn August 2016, MediaMall launched PlayOn Cloud, a cloud-based DVR for streaming video, accessed and controlled from mobile apps available in the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] and [[Google Play]]. The PlayOn Cloud service starts a virtual machine in the cloud on behalf of the user. PlayOn Cloud charges users to initiate online recordings, through purchasing \"credits\" within the app. Videos are recorded in real-time, and once complete, can be downloaded directly to the app or to a PC, for later viewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/11/playon-cloud-lets-you-record-and-download-videos-from-streaming-services-to-your-iphone/ |title=PlayOn Cloud lets you record and download videos from streaming services to your iPhone |publisher=TechCrunch | date=2016-11-11 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}</ref>\n\nPlayOn Cloud allows users to subscribe to an optional paid storage service, so that recordings can be stored indefinitely in the cloud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedigitalmediazone.com/2017/12/13/playon-cloud-storage-cloud-dvr/ |title=PlayOn Cloud Storage = Cloud DVR |publisher=The Digital Media Zone |date=2017-12-13 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}</ref>\nIn March 2020, PlayOn.TV Australia was launched to provide the PlayOn Cloud app with region-specific features for the Australian audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/512266701/playon-announces-australian-expansion-with-introduction-of-playon-tv-australia |title=PlayOn Announces Australian Expansion with Introduction of PlayOn TV Australia |publisher=Ein News |date=2020-03-17 |accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\n===PlayOn Desktop===\n\nIn August 2008, MediaMall launched PlayOn Desktop, a Windows-based consumer software product.

It uses [[HTTP Streaming]] to communicate with devices such as [[Roku]], [[Chromecast]], [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Wii]], and [[Wii U]], working both as an Internet browser to access online media and as a UPnP media server to serve videos to compliant devices.<ref name=\"userguide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playon.tv/user-guide |title=PlayOn User Guide |publisher=PlayOn |date= |accessdate=2015-12-10}}</ref>\n\nPlayOn Desktop includes native companion applications for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Chromecast]], and [[Roku]]. The software also organizes local media from the PC into a Media Library dashboard, which can be streamed or cast to viewing devices.\n\n===MyMedia===\n\nMyMedia was a free media server software application that allowed users to stream personal media from their PC to various media devices.

PlayLater recorded streaming content from numerous popular online streaming sites. Videos recorded by PlayLater could then be accessed and watched without the need for an Internet connection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/251892/playlater.html |title=PlayLater Lets You Watch Your Shows on the Web--And In Your Own Sweet Time |publisher=PCWorld |date=2012-03-17 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}</ref>\n\nPlayLater was rolled into PlayOn Desktop in September 2015, and is no longer available as a stand-alone software product.\n\n==Supported devices==\n\nPlayOn Cloud is available as a native application on iOS and Android. Videos recorded with PlayOn Cloud, once downloaded from the cloud service, can be viewed directly in the given mobile application. Similarly, recordings can be downloaded and viewed on the user's PC, or on home-networked devices, using any media streaming software.\n\nVideos recorded with PlayOn Desktop can be viewed via a device that supports the technology standard [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) as defined by the [[Digital Living Network Alliance]] (DLNA). DLNA devices use the home network to connect to the PC with PlayOn Desktop installed. The device is then able to interact with PlayOn Desktop and lets users view streaming content on that system.

The suite consists of two main products: [[#PlayOn Cloud|PlayOn Cloud]] and [[#PlayOn Desktop|PlayOn Desktop]]. PlayOn Cloud is an online service for recording digital video streams, accessible via native [[iOS]] or [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile device applications. PlayOn Desktop is [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-based software that acts as a streaming dashboard and hub on the PC. The available streaming websites are organized as channels in both products. Users browse through or search the video content found in those channels in order to record the videos for later viewing. PlayOn Desktop allows watching the videos real-time on the PC, or casting the videos to a TV via a streaming device or gaming console.\n\nThe recording feature of PlayOn acts as a [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] for streaming videos, creating an [[MPEG-4]] file which can be transferred to supported media devices. Users are then able to watch these videos without necessitating access to the Internet. The recording functionality inserts chapter marks at the locations of advertisements, allowing users to automatically skip commercials when watching via a native companion applications, directly in the PlayOn Desktop player on a PC, or via a variety of other DLNA-compliant media devices.\n\n==Software==\n\n===PlayOn Cloud===\n\nIn August 2016, MediaMall launched PlayOn Cloud, a cloud-based DVR for streaming video, accessed and controlled from mobile apps available in the [[App Store (iOS)|iOS App Store]] and [[Google Play]]. The PlayOn Cloud service starts a virtual machine in the cloud on behalf of the user. PlayOn Cloud charges users to initiate online recordings, through purchasing \"credits\" within the app. Videos are recorded in real-time, and once complete, can be downloaded directly to the app or to a PC, for later viewing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/11/playon-cloud-lets-you-record-and-download-videos-from-streaming-services-to-your-iphone/ |title=PlayOn Cloud lets you record and download videos from streaming services to your iPhone |publisher=TechCrunch | date=2016-11-11 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}</ref>\n\nPlayOn Cloud allows users to subscribe to an optional paid storage service, so that recordings can be stored indefinitely in the cloud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedigitalmediazone.com/2017/12/13/playon-cloud-storage-cloud-dvr/ |title=PlayOn Cloud Storage = Cloud DVR |publisher=The Digital Media Zone |date=2017-12-13 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}</ref>\nIn March 2020, PlayOn.TV Australia was launched to provide the PlayOn Cloud app with region-specific features for the Australian audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.einnews.com/pr_news/512266701/playon-announces-australian-expansion-with-introduction-of-playon-tv-australia |title=PlayOn Announces Australian Expansion with Introduction of PlayOn TV Australia |publisher=Ein News |date=2020-03-17 |accessdate=2020-03-23}}</ref>\n\n===PlayOn Desktop===\n\nIn August 2008, MediaMall launched PlayOn Desktop, a Windows-based consumer software product. It acts as a digital media server to streaming devices, game consoles, televisions, and [[set-top boxes]] to watch Internet-based videos from online content providers such as Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-playon-1847433 |title=What is PlayOn? |publisher=Lifewire |date=2017-12-06 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}</ref>\n\nPlayOn Desktop uses the technology standard [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP), as defined by the [[Digital Living Network Alliance]] (DLNA), to communicate with networked gaming consoles like the [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], and other Internet ready DLNA enabled devices. It uses [[HTTP Streaming]] to communicate with devices such as [[Roku]], [[Chromecast]], [[iPad]], [[iPhone]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Wii]], and [[Wii U]], working both as an Internet browser to access online media and as a UPnP media server to serve videos to compliant devices.<ref name=\"userguide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.playon.tv/user-guide |title=PlayOn User Guide |publisher=PlayOn |date= |accessdate=2015-12-10}}</ref>\n\nPlayOn Desktop includes native companion applications for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Chromecast]], and [[Roku]]. The software also organizes local media from the PC into a Media Library dashboard, which can be streamed or cast to viewing devices.\n\n===MyMedia===\n\nMyMedia was a free media server software application that allowed users to stream personal media from their PC to various media devices. It was released on May 22, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mymedia-lets-users-stream-personal-content-to-their-tvs-for-free-2013-05-22 |title=MyMedia Lets Users Stream Personal Content to Their TVs for Free |publisher= Business Wire |date= |accessdate=2013-05-22}}</ref> It was retired in September 2015.\n\nThe '''MyMedia''' brand is still available as a channel on Roku devices. It allows users to stream personal media to their Rokus from the PlayOn Media Library. Users can stream or cast music, photos, and home videos or local video files to their Roku.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://channelstore.roku.com/details/22328/mymedia |title=MyMedia Channel for Roku |publisher= Roku |date= |accessdate=2015-12-10}}</ref>\n\n===PlayLater===\n\n[[File:PlayLater by MediaMall Technologies Logo.svg|250px|right|thumb|PlayLater was released in 2011. It was rolled into PlayOn Desktop in 2015.]]\n\nPlayLater was released September 2011, as a digital video recorder (DVR) for online videos. PlayLater recorded streaming content from numerous popular online streaming sites. Videos recorded by PlayLater could then be accessed and watched without the need for an Internet connection.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/251892/playlater.html |title=PlayLater Lets You Watch Your Shows on the Web--And In Your Own Sweet Time |publisher=PCWorld |date=2012-03-17 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}</ref>\n\nPlayLater was rolled into PlayOn Desktop in September 2015, and is no longer available as a stand-alone software product.\n\n==Supported devices==\n\nPlayOn Cloud is available as a native application on iOS and Android. Videos recorded with PlayOn Cloud, once downloaded from the cloud service, can be viewed directly in the given mobile application. Similarly, recordings can be downloaded and viewed on the user's PC, or on home-networked devices, using any media streaming software.\n\nVideos recorded with PlayOn Desktop can be viewed via a device that supports the technology standard [[Universal Plug and Play]] (UPnP) as defined by the [[Digital Living Network Alliance]] (DLNA). DLNA devices use the home network to connect to the PC with PlayOn Desktop installed. The device is then able to interact with PlayOn Desktop and lets users view streaming content on that system. There are native PlayOn Desktop applications for Roku, iOS, and Android.\n\n==Content==\n\nPlayOn Desktop and PlayOn Cloud support a number of online content providers, including Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video. Many of the channels require an active subscription to access. PlayOn Desktop provides access to more channels than PlayOn Cloud.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/story/why-you-cant-download-all-the-streaming-media/ |title=Why You Can't Download All the Streaming Media You Want |publisher=Wired |date=2017-08-21 |accessdate=2018-04-13}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.playon.tv/ PlayOn]\n\n[[Category:Media servers]]\n[[Category:Digital television]]\n[[Category:IOS software]]\n[[Category:Android (operating system) software]]\n[[Category:Privately held companies based in New York (state)]]\n", "name_user": "185.169.181.134", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayOn"}
