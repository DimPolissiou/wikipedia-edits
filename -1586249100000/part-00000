In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of Genoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks. Faced with such a spectacle one thinks of the temptation of Christ. We are exalted by joy, we are hovering between shining spheres, which have become the center of a world.\"<ref name=\"pet3\">{{cite web\n |title        = Stairs that continue to reveal themselves: the church of the Petraio and the villa where Paul Klee lived\n |publisher    = Vomero Magazine\n |author       = Identitainsorgenti.com\n |date         = October 4, 2017\n |url          = https://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.identitainsorgenti.com%2Fnapoli-a-piedi-scale-che-continuano-a-svelarsi-la-chiesa-del-petraio-e-la-villa-dove-dimoro-paul-klee%2F}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In the film [[The Four Days of Naples]], in the early stages of the Neapolitan uprising, a young man can be heard shouting: \"Pe 'e criatur' ro Petraio!\".\n*Popularly, the expression salir\u00e8 'ncoppo' is used in Santar\u00e8lla, which indicates the need to go from the Petraio to Villa La Santarella and Piazza Vanvitelli.\n*Author [[Nicola Pugliese]] in his book ''Malacqua'', cites Petraio, describing the origin of his name.\n\n==See also==\n[[Stairways in Naples]]<br>\n[[Matera]]\n\n{{coord|40|50|35.87|N|14|14|10.70|E|display=title|region:IT_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n==External References==\n* [https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=it&rurl=translate.google.it&sl=it&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://www.scaledinapoli.com/&usg=ALkJrhjlxbq3eRVLr6oflxJlrzYoms77hA Stairways of Naples]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Petraio}}\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Naples]]\n[[Category:Zones of Naples]]\n[[Category:Lists of buildings and structures in Italy|Naples stairways]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Naples_Petraio.jpeg|thumb|300px]]\n[[File:The Petraio Naples Italy-02.jpeg|thumb|300px]]\n[[File:Petraio Napoli 03.jpeg|thumb|300px|Pensione Haase, Salita del Petraio]]\n[[File:Petraio Napoli 04.jpeg|thumb|300px]]\nThe '''Petraio''' is a lineal urban neighborhood and pedestrian path in [[Naples, Italy]].

In his diaries, he compared Geonoa and Naples:\n\n\"It is already impossible for me to even enumerate what I have seen. Compared to Genoa, Naples is indolent, messy and sick. Compared to Naples, Genoa is one-sided. Naples has the greatest splendor alongside the greatest misery. Port life, carriage ride, high-level opera house, even a piece of Rome: the National Museum. Beside this the heavenly nature, unmatched. The sea of Genoa more imposing, but also more monotonous. Here a placid cove, framed by strange mountains and closed by characteristic islands. And all I can see from the balcony of my room. Like a giant amphitheater, the wonderful city with its intense buzz lies at my feet. On the left the old city with the docks of the port and the ancient Vesuvius, on the right the modern Villa Nazionale and Posillipo. All around the house there are gardens of fresh green, fantastic shapes and myriads of flowers. Salita del Petraio, Villa De Rosa 48, Pensione Haase, Naples, is called this fabulous panoramic lookout. The sea is wonderfully blue and calm. The city is a lively picture of clarity, facades of blocks of houses, in the light and darkness, white streets, sections of dark green parks. Faced with such a spectacle one thinks of the temptation of Christ. We are exalted by joy, we are hovering between shining spheres, which have become the center of a world.\"<ref name=\"pet3\">{{cite web\n |title        = Stairs that continue to reveal themselves: the church of the Petraio and the villa where Paul Klee lived\n |publisher    = Vomero Magazine\n |author       = Identitainsorgenti.com\n |date         = October 4, 2017\n |url          = https://translate.google.it/translate?hl=it&sl=it&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.identitainsorgenti.com%2Fnapoli-a-piedi-scale-che-continuano-a-svelarsi-la-chiesa-del-petraio-e-la-villa-dove-dimoro-paul-klee%2F}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n*In the film [[The Four Days of Naples]], in the early stages of the Neapolitan uprising, a young man can be heard shouting: \"Pe 'e criatur' ro Petraio!\".\n*Popularly, the expression salir\u00e8 'ncoppo' is used in Santar\u00e8lla, which indicates the need to go from the Petraio to Villa La Santarella and Piazza Vanvitelli.\n*Author [[Nicola Pugliese]] in his book ''Malacqua'', cites Petraio, describing the origin of his name.\n\n==See also==\n[[Stairways in Naples]]<br>\n[[Matera]]\n\n{{coord|40|50|35.87|N|14|14|10.70|E|display=title|region:IT_type:city_source:GNS-enwiki}}\n\n==External References==\n* [https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=it&rurl=translate.google.it&sl=it&sp=nmt4&tl=en&u=http://www.scaledinapoli.com/&usg=ALkJrhjlxbq3eRVLr6oflxJlrzYoms77hA Stairways of Naples]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Petraio}}\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Naples]]\n[[Category:Zones of Naples]]\n[[Category:Lists of buildings and structures in Italy|Naples stairways]]\n", "name_user": "842U", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petraio"}

In 1977, Mack won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his book ''A Prince of Our Disorder'' on [[T.E.

He was also known as a leading researcher on the psychology of [[teenage suicide]] and [[drug addiction]], and he later became a researcher in the psychology of [[alien abduction]] experiences.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feeney |first=Mark |title=Pulitzer Winner is Killed in Accident |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=September 29, 2004}}</ref> \n==Early life, education and military service==\nMack was born in [[New York City]], to an academic, [[German Jewish]] family.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1472937/John-E-Mack.html John E Mack] Telegraph Obituary, 30 Sep 2004</ref> His father, the historian Edward Clarence Mack (1904-1973), was a professor at [[City College of New York|CUNY]], while his mother Eleanor Liebmann Mack (1905-1930) died while John was an infant. After his mother died, his father remarried the economist Ruth P. Mack, through which he had a half-sister, Mary Lee Ingbar, a pioneer of computer analysis who became a professor at [[Dartmouth College]] and [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]].<ref>[https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/10/mary-lee-ingbar-dies-at-83 Mary Lee Ingbar, pioneer in field of health economics, dies at 83] The Harvard Gazette, October 15, 2009</ref> Growing up, his father would read the Bible to John and his sister, but as a work of culture or literature. Mack graduated from the [[Horace Mann School|Horace Mann-Lincoln School]] in 1947 and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[Oberlin College|Oberlin]] in 1951, and received his medical doctorate degree ''cum laude'' from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1955. Mack subsequently interned at the Massachusetts General Hospital and trained as a psychiatrist at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. \n\nIn 1959, Mack joined the [[US Air Force]], serving as a [[medic]] in [[Japan]], where he rose to the rank of captain. In 1961 he returned from military service in Japan, continuing at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center and Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute receiving certification in child and adult [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychotherapy]]. From 1964 Mack returned to Harvard Medical School, becoming a full professor at Harvard in 1972. In 1977, he became the Head of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, which position he occupied until his death in 2004. \n\nMack published over 150 scientific articles and eleven books in his career. As department head at Harvard Medical School, he worked primarily in the field of child and adolescent psychology. He worked on treating suicidal patients, and published research on [[heroin addiction]].<ref>''Heroin Use as an Attempt To Cope: Clinical Observations'', EDWARD J. KHANTZIAN , JOHN E. MACK , and ALAN F. SCHATZBERG, The American Journal of Psychiatry, Volume 131\nIssue 2</ref> The dominant theme of his life's work at Harvard had been the exploration of how one's perceptions of the world affect one's relationships. He addressed this issue of \"[[world view]]\" on the individual level in his early clinical explorations of dreams, nightmares and teen suicide, and in ''A Prince of Our Disorder'', his biographical study of the life of British officer [[T. E. Lawrence]], for which he received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize for Biography]] in 1977.<ref>Mack 1976</ref>\n\n== Activism during the Cold War ==\nIn the 1980s, Mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the [[Cold War]], including former United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] and the \"father of the [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]]\", [[Edward Teller]]. \n\nMack, together with luminaries such as [[Carl Sagan]] and other [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]] (the United States affiliate of [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]]) promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]. Emboldened by the organization's receipt of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1985, Mack, Sagan, and 700 other academics walked upon the grounds of the [[Nevada Test Site]] in the summer of 1986, setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cevoli |first=Cathy |title=Putting It On The Line In Nevada |url=http://johnemackinstitute.org/1986/07/putting-it-on-the-line-in-nevada/ | journal=Nuclear Times |date=July\u2013August 1986 |pages=36\u201337}}</ref>\n\n==The psychology of alien abduction phenomena==\nIn the early 1990s, Mack commenced a decade-plus psychological study of 200 men and women who reported recurrent [[alien abduction|alien encounter]] experiences. Such encounters had seen some limited attention from academic figures, [[R. Leo Sprinkle]] perhaps being the earliest, in the 1960s. Mack, however, remains probably the most esteemed academic to have studied the subject.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nHe initially suspected that such persons were suffering from [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], but when no obvious pathologies were present in the persons he interviewed, his interest was piqued. Following encouragement from longtime friend [[Thomas Kuhn]], who predicted that the subject might be controversial, but urged Mack to collect data and ignore prevailing materialist, dualist and \"either/or\" analysis, Mack began concerted study and interviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pulitzer.org/article/researching-book-insights-pulitzer-winning-biographers-and-historians |title=Researching the Book: Insights from Pulitzer-Winning Biographers and Historians |date=2019-12-22 |website=Pulitzer.org |access-date=2020-03-28 |quote=\"\u2026Mack \u2014 who consulted family friend and philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn before initiating the research program \u2014 was careful to confine his findings to subjective experiences, '[suspending] judgment' and never indulging in ontological extrapolation.\"}}</ref> Many of those he interviewed reported that their encounters had affected the way they regarded the world, including producing a heightened sense of [[spirituality]] and environmental concern.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Begiebing |first1=Robert |date=Spring 2000 |title=Thinking Like a Cancer |url= https://amoskeagjournal.wordpress.com/past-issues/2000-2/ |journal=New Hampshire College Journal |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=44-62 |access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://johnemackinstitute.org/2000/03/thinking-like-a-cancer/ |title=Thinking Like a Cancer |last=Begiebing |first=Robert |date=2000-03-20 |website=JohnEMackInstitute.org |access-date= |quote=\"\u2026we might view Mack\u2019s and Meadows\u2019 books as parallel texts\u2026they both arrive at the same conclusions about our ecological crisis\u2026\"}}</ref>\n\nMack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that \"On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go.\"<ref>Matheson 1998, p. 251.</ref> In a 1994 interview,  Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed \"inclined to take these [abduction] reports at face value\". Mack replied by saying \"Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't have a way to account for them.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Encounters with Aliens - Part 1: Abductions and the Western Paradigm |url=http://www.intuition.org/txt/mack1.htm |work=Intuition Network |access-date=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926222933/http://www.intuition.org/txt/mack1.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2011 }}</ref> Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, \"I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [But] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is but it seems to me that it invites a deeper, further inquiry.\"<ref name=\"Hind 2005\"/>\n\nMack noted that there was a worldwide history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-[[industrialisation|industrial]] societies. One example is the [[vision quest]] common to some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures. Only fairly recently in [[Western culture]], notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts might best be considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://johnemackinstitute.org/1992/10/alien-territory/ |title=Alien Territory |last=Terry |first= Sara |date=1992-10-11 |access-date=2020-03-28 |work=The Boston Globe Magazine |pages=20-27 |quote=\"...Eastern and native cultures, have been far more fluent than the West in communing with experiences that defy understanding in terms of physical reality, says Mack.\"}}</ref>\n\nHis interest in the spiritual or transformational aspects of people's alien encounters, and his suggestion that the experience of alien contact itself may be more transcendent than physical in nature\u2014yet nonetheless real\u2014set him apart from many of his contemporaries, such as [[Budd Hopkins]], who advocated the physical reality of aliens.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nHis later research broadened into the general consideration of the merits of an expanded notion of reality, one which allows for experiences that may not fit the Western materialist paradigm, yet deeply affect people's lives. His second (and final) book on the alien encounter experience, ''Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters'' (1999), was as much a philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern world-views as it was the culmination of his work with the \"experiencers\" of alien encounters, to whom the book is dedicated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-517-70568-1|title=Religion Book Review: Passport to the Cosmos|website=Publishers Weekly|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Investigation by Harvard for his work on \"alien abduction\" cases==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 320px\n| align = right\n| quote =  \"John addressed my very large class, and was forthright, charming, intelligent, and disarmingly honest about what he knew and did not know.

Tosteson, appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review Mack's clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him (some of their cases were written of in Mack's 1994 book ''Abduction''). Angela Hind wrote, \"It was the first time in Harvard's history that a tenured professor was subjected to such an investigation.\"<ref name=\"Hind 2005\">{{cite web |last1=Hind |first1=Angela |title=Alien thinking |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4071124.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=November 20, 2018 |date=June 8, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe committee chairman was [[Arnold S. Relman|Arnold \"Budd\" Relman, M.D.]], a Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School who served as editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]''. According to [[Daniel Sheehan (attorney)|Daniel P. Sheehan]], one of Mack's attorneys, the committee's draft report suggested that \"To communicate, in any way whatsoever, to a person who has reported a \u2018close encounter\u2019 with an extraterrestrial life form that this experience might well have been real&nbsp;... is professionally irresponsible.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/klass_files_volume_32/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227213727/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/klass_files_volume_32 |archive-date=2018-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nUpon the public revelation of the existence of the committee (inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for Mack's defense, ten months into the process), questions arose from the academic community (including Harvard Professor of Law [[Alan Dershowitz]]) regarding the validity of an investigation of a tenured professor who was not suspected of ethics violations or professional misconduct. Concluding the fourteen-month investigation, Harvard then issued a statement stating that the Dean had \"reaffirmed Dr. Mack's academic freedom to study what he wishes and to state his opinions without impediment,\" concluding \"Dr. Mack remains a member in good standing of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine.\" (Mack was [[censure]]d in the committee's report for what they believed were methodological errors, but Dean Tosteson took no action based on the committee's assessment.) He had received legal help from Roderick MacLeish and Daniel Sheehan<ref>[http://danielpsheehan.com danielpsheehan.com]</ref> (of the [[New York Times Co. v.

He lost consciousness at the scene of the accident and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The driver, Raymond Czechowski, an IT manager, was arrested at the scene, and later entered a plea of guilty by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol. Mack's family requested leniency for the suspect Czechowski in a letter to the [[Wood Green]] Crown Court. \"Although this was a tragic event for our family,\" the letter reads, \"we feel [the accused's] behavior was neither malicious nor intentional, and we have no ill will toward him since we learned of the circumstances of the collision.\" The driver, Ray Czechowski served 6 months and was disqualified from driving for 3 years.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bueche |first=Will |title=Driver In Dr John Mack Accident Sentenced |url=http://ufoupdateslist.com/2005/oct/m08-012.shtml |work=UFO Updates |date= October 7, 2005 |access-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nHe wrote the following books:\n* ''Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters'' (1999)\n* ''Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens'' (1994)\n* ''A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T.E.

In 1977, Mack won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his book ''A Prince of Our Disorder'' on [[T.E. Lawrence]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/john-e-mack|title=The 1977 Pulitzer Prize Winner in Biography|website=Pulitzer.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nAs the head of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Mack's clinical expertise was in [[child psychology]], [[adolescent psychology]], and the [[psychology of religion]]. He was also known as a leading researcher on the psychology of [[teenage suicide]] and [[drug addiction]], and he later became a researcher in the psychology of [[alien abduction]] experiences.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feeney |first=Mark |title=Pulitzer Winner is Killed in Accident |newspaper=The Boston Globe |date=September 29, 2004}}</ref> \n==Early life, education and military service==\nMack was born in [[New York City]], to an academic, [[German Jewish]] family.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1472937/John-E-Mack.html John E Mack] Telegraph Obituary, 30 Sep 2004</ref> His father, the historian Edward Clarence Mack (1904-1973), was a professor at [[City College of New York|CUNY]], while his mother Eleanor Liebmann Mack (1905-1930) died while John was an infant. After his mother died, his father remarried the economist Ruth P. Mack, through which he had a half-sister, Mary Lee Ingbar, a pioneer of computer analysis who became a professor at [[Dartmouth College]] and [[University of Massachusetts Medical School]].<ref>[https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/10/mary-lee-ingbar-dies-at-83 Mary Lee Ingbar, pioneer in field of health economics, dies at 83] The Harvard Gazette, October 15, 2009</ref> Growing up, his father would read the Bible to John and his sister, but as a work of culture or literature. Mack graduated from the [[Horace Mann School|Horace Mann-Lincoln School]] in 1947 and [[Phi Beta Kappa]] from [[Oberlin College|Oberlin]] in 1951, and received his medical doctorate degree ''cum laude'' from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1955. Mack subsequently interned at the Massachusetts General Hospital and trained as a psychiatrist at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. \n\nIn 1959, Mack joined the [[US Air Force]], serving as a [[medic]] in [[Japan]], where he rose to the rank of captain. In 1961 he returned from military service in Japan, continuing at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center and Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute receiving certification in child and adult [[psychoanalysis]] and [[psychotherapy]]. From 1964 Mack returned to Harvard Medical School, becoming a full professor at Harvard in 1972. In 1977, he became the Head of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, which position he occupied until his death in 2004. \n\nMack published over 150 scientific articles and eleven books in his career. As department head at Harvard Medical School, he worked primarily in the field of child and adolescent psychology. He worked on treating suicidal patients, and published research on [[heroin addiction]].<ref>''Heroin Use as an Attempt To Cope: Clinical Observations'', EDWARD J. KHANTZIAN , JOHN E. MACK , and ALAN F. SCHATZBERG, The American Journal of Psychiatry, Volume 131\nIssue 2</ref> The dominant theme of his life's work at Harvard had been the exploration of how one's perceptions of the world affect one's relationships. He addressed this issue of \"[[world view]]\" on the individual level in his early clinical explorations of dreams, nightmares and teen suicide, and in ''A Prince of Our Disorder'', his biographical study of the life of British officer [[T. E. Lawrence]], for which he received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography|Pulitzer Prize for Biography]] in 1977.<ref>Mack 1976</ref>\n\n== Activism during the Cold War ==\nIn the 1980s, Mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the [[Cold War]], including former United States President [[Jimmy Carter]] and the \"father of the [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]]\", [[Edward Teller]]. \n\nMack, together with luminaries such as [[Carl Sagan]] and other [[Physicians for Social Responsibility]] (the United States affiliate of [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]]) promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]]. Emboldened by the organization's receipt of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1985, Mack, Sagan, and 700 other academics walked upon the grounds of the [[Nevada Test Site]] in the summer of 1986, setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cevoli |first=Cathy |title=Putting It On The Line In Nevada |url=http://johnemackinstitute.org/1986/07/putting-it-on-the-line-in-nevada/ | journal=Nuclear Times |date=July\u2013August 1986 |pages=36\u201337}}</ref>\n\n==The psychology of alien abduction phenomena==\nIn the early 1990s, Mack commenced a decade-plus psychological study of 200 men and women who reported recurrent [[alien abduction|alien encounter]] experiences. Such encounters had seen some limited attention from academic figures, [[R. Leo Sprinkle]] perhaps being the earliest, in the 1960s. Mack, however, remains probably the most esteemed academic to have studied the subject.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nHe initially suspected that such persons were suffering from [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], but when no obvious pathologies were present in the persons he interviewed, his interest was piqued. Following encouragement from longtime friend [[Thomas Kuhn]], who predicted that the subject might be controversial, but urged Mack to collect data and ignore prevailing materialist, dualist and \"either/or\" analysis, Mack began concerted study and interviews.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pulitzer.org/article/researching-book-insights-pulitzer-winning-biographers-and-historians |title=Researching the Book: Insights from Pulitzer-Winning Biographers and Historians |date=2019-12-22 |website=Pulitzer.org |access-date=2020-03-28 |quote=\"\u2026Mack \u2014 who consulted family friend and philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn before initiating the research program \u2014 was careful to confine his findings to subjective experiences, '[suspending] judgment' and never indulging in ontological extrapolation.\"}}</ref> Many of those he interviewed reported that their encounters had affected the way they regarded the world, including producing a heightened sense of [[spirituality]] and environmental concern.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Begiebing |first1=Robert |date=Spring 2000 |title=Thinking Like a Cancer |url= https://amoskeagjournal.wordpress.com/past-issues/2000-2/ |journal=New Hampshire College Journal |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=44-62 |access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web |url=http://johnemackinstitute.org/2000/03/thinking-like-a-cancer/ |title=Thinking Like a Cancer |last=Begiebing |first=Robert |date=2000-03-20 |website=JohnEMackInstitute.org |access-date= |quote=\"\u2026we might view Mack\u2019s and Meadows\u2019 books as parallel texts\u2026they both arrive at the same conclusions about our ecological crisis\u2026\"}}</ref>\n\nMack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that \"On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go.\"<ref>Matheson 1998, p. 251.</ref> In a 1994 interview,  Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed \"inclined to take these [abduction] reports at face value\". Mack replied by saying \"Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't have a way to account for them.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Encounters with Aliens - Part 1: Abductions and the Western Paradigm |url=http://www.intuition.org/txt/mack1.htm |work=Intuition Network |access-date=September 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926222933/http://www.intuition.org/txt/mack1.htm |archivedate=September 26, 2011 }}</ref> Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, \"I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [But] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is but it seems to me that it invites a deeper, further inquiry.\"<ref name=\"Hind 2005\"/>\n\nMack noted that there was a worldwide history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-[[industrialisation|industrial]] societies. One example is the [[vision quest]] common to some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures. Only fairly recently in [[Western culture]], notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts might best be considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://johnemackinstitute.org/1992/10/alien-territory/ |title=Alien Territory |last=Terry |first= Sara |date=1992-10-11 |access-date=2020-03-28 |work=The Boston Globe Magazine |pages=20-27 |quote=\"...Eastern and native cultures, have been far more fluent than the West in communing with experiences that defy understanding in terms of physical reality, says Mack.\"}}</ref>\n\nHis interest in the spiritual or transformational aspects of people's alien encounters, and his suggestion that the experience of alien contact itself may be more transcendent than physical in nature\u2014yet nonetheless real\u2014set him apart from many of his contemporaries, such as [[Budd Hopkins]], who advocated the physical reality of aliens.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nHis later research broadened into the general consideration of the merits of an expanded notion of reality, one which allows for experiences that may not fit the Western materialist paradigm, yet deeply affect people's lives. His second (and final) book on the alien encounter experience, ''Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters'' (1999), was as much a philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern world-views as it was the culmination of his work with the \"experiencers\" of alien encounters, to whom the book is dedicated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-517-70568-1|title=Religion Book Review: Passport to the Cosmos|website=Publishers Weekly|language=en|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n==Investigation by Harvard for his work on \"alien abduction\" cases==\n{{Quote box\n| width = 320px\n| align = right\n| quote =  \"John addressed my very large class, and was forthright, charming, intelligent, and disarmingly honest about what he knew and did not know.

Tosteson, appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review Mack's clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him (some of their cases were written of in Mack's 1994 book ''Abduction''). Angela Hind wrote, \"It was the first time in Harvard's history that a tenured professor was subjected to such an investigation.\"<ref name=\"Hind 2005\">{{cite web |last1=Hind |first1=Angela |title=Alien thinking |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4071124.stm |publisher=BBC |accessdate=November 20, 2018 |date=June 8, 2005}}</ref>\n\nThe committee chairman was [[Arnold S. Relman|Arnold \"Budd\" Relman, M.D.]], a Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School who served as editor of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]''. According to [[Daniel Sheehan (attorney)|Daniel P. Sheehan]], one of Mack's attorneys, the committee's draft report suggested that \"To communicate, in any way whatsoever, to a person who has reported a \u2018close encounter\u2019 with an extraterrestrial life form that this experience might well have been real&nbsp;... is professionally irresponsible.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/klass_files_volume_32/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227213727/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/klass_files_volume_32 |archive-date=2018-02-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nUpon the public revelation of the existence of the committee (inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for Mack's defense, ten months into the process), questions arose from the academic community (including Harvard Professor of Law [[Alan Dershowitz]]) regarding the validity of an investigation of a tenured professor who was not suspected of ethics violations or professional misconduct. Concluding the fourteen-month investigation, Harvard then issued a statement stating that the Dean had \"reaffirmed Dr. Mack's academic freedom to study what he wishes and to state his opinions without impediment,\" concluding \"Dr. Mack remains a member in good standing of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine.\" (Mack was [[censure]]d in the committee's report for what they believed were methodological errors, but Dean Tosteson took no action based on the committee's assessment.) He had received legal help from Roderick MacLeish and Daniel Sheehan<ref>[http://danielpsheehan.com danielpsheehan.com]</ref> (of the [[New York Times Co. v. United States|Pentagon Papers]] case),<ref>{{cite web |title=Daniel P Sheehan, Legal Strategist and Constitutional Attorney |url=http://www.danielpsheehan.com |work=www.danielpsheehan.net |access-date=2011-09-01}}</ref> and the support of [[Laurance Rockefeller]], who also funded Mack's non-profit organization for four consecutive years at $250,000 per year.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Paul B. |title=The Rockefeller UFO Report, or, How a Millionaire and a Socialite New Ager are Trying to Influence World Leaders about UFOs |url=http://www.parascope.com/nb/rockyufo.htm |year=1996 |work=www.parascope.com |publisher=ParaScope, Inc. |access-date=2011-09-01}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn Monday, September 27, 2004 while in London to lecture at a T.

He lost consciousness at the scene of the accident and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The driver, Raymond Czechowski, an IT manager, was arrested at the scene, and later entered a plea of guilty by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol. Mack's family requested leniency for the suspect Czechowski in a letter to the [[Wood Green]] Crown Court. \"Although this was a tragic event for our family,\" the letter reads, \"we feel [the accused's] behavior was neither malicious nor intentional, and we have no ill will toward him since we learned of the circumstances of the collision.\" The driver, Ray Czechowski served 6 months and was disqualified from driving for 3 years.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bueche |first=Will |title=Driver In Dr John Mack Accident Sentenced |url=http://ufoupdateslist.com/2005/oct/m08-012.shtml |work=UFO Updates |date= October 7, 2005 |access-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nHe wrote the following books:\n* ''Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters'' (1999)\n* ''Abduction: Human Encounters with Aliens'' (1994)\n* ''A Prince of Our Disorder: The Life of T.E.

He served as [[Treasurer of Western Australia|colonial treasurer]] under two [[Premier of Western Australia|premiers]], [[Walter James]] and [[Henry Lefroy]]. Gardiner was also the inaugural state leader of the [[National Party of Australia (WA)|Country Party]] from 1914 to 1915, and briefly served as [[Speaker of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Speaker of the Legislative Assembly]] from March to June 1917.\n\n==Early life==\n\nGardiner was born at [[Papakura]], [[New Zealand]] (south of [[Auckland]]), to Mary (n\u00e9e Craig) and George Gardiner. Moving to [[South Australia]] early in 1865, Gardiner was initially educated in [[Port Augusta, South Australia|Port Augusta]] then from 1870 in [[Saddleworth, South Australia|Saddleworth]]. After he left school at age 11, he worked in the business of wheat-buyers Ernst Siekmann and [[John Moule (politician)]], then with the South Australian Carrying Company Limited for three years<ref>[[David Black (historian)|Black D]]. & [[Geoffrey Bolton|Bolton G]]. 1990, ''Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia, Volume One 1870-1930'', Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project.</ref> and other commercial companies in Saddleworth.\n\nFrom 1882 to 1885 he was an accountant in [[Naracoorte, South Australia|Naracoorte]], and secretary of its Pastoral and Agricultural Society, the Naracoorte Institute and the Naracoorte Turf Club.<ref>''Narracoorte Herald'', 7 July 1882, p. 2; ''Narracoorte Herald'', 12 October 1883, p. 3; ''Border Watch'', 20 May 1885, p. 2; ''Western Mail'', 16 December 1898, p. 28; ''Border Watch'', 2 November 1923, p. 3.</ref> In early 1886 Gardiner briefly took a post as a provisional school teacher at Lochaber, South Australia.<ref>''Border Watch'', 17 February 1886, p. 3; ''Border Watch'', 24 July 1886, p. 2; 1963, J. Murdoch and H. Parker, ''History of Naracoorte'', p. 105.</ref>\n\nGardiner then worked from mid-1886<ref>''Border Watch'', 26 May 1886, p. 3.</ref> in [[Melbourne]] as an accountant and auctioneer for William Hamilton & Co., a stock and station agency.<ref>1981, '[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080633b.htm James Gardiner]', in G.

He also pursued land settlement and development, and was foremost in developing land around the [[Moora]] region.\n\nFrom 1897 to 1899 he served as chairman of the Western Australian Cricket Council.<ref>''Western Mail'', 28 January 1898, p. 26.</ref> He subsequently served two further terms as president of the [[Western Australian Cricket Association]] (WACA), 1906 to 1915 and 1917 to 1924.<ref>Western Australian Cricket Association 1983, ''Year Book 1982-83'', Perth.</ref>\n\n==Western Australian federation==\n\nGardiner ran for parliament at the [[1900 Albany colonial by-election|1900 Albany by-election]], after [[George Leake]] resigned. Although he lost that by-election, he was actively involved in the campaign for the [[federation of Australia]]. During the federal campaign, the [[Parliament of Western Australia|Western Australian parliament]] at first refused the people of the colony the right to vote for or against accepting the draft [[Australian constitution|Commonwealth constitution]], a right available to electors in all other Australian colonies. James Gardiner, George Leake and [[Walter James]], with other supporters of federation, promoted the 'Bill to the People Petition' supporting federal union. The petition was initially unheeded by parliament, but the cause was furthered by the 'Separation for Federation' movement on the [[Goldfields-Esperance|goldfields]].<ref>Kirwan J. 2000, 'How Western Australia Joined the Commonwealth', in L.

Gardiner campaigned with Walter James in June 1900 to allay the fears of [[Collie, Western Australia|Collie]] coal miners that the coal industry would suffer as a result of federation.<ref>Hillman W. 2000, 'The 1900 Federal Referendum in Western Australia', in L.

A new government under [[Walter James]] emerged in July 1902, and Gardiner was appointed [[Treasurer of Western Australia|colonial treasurer]]. Aware that [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] disadvantaged Western Australia due to the loss of revenue previously raised through inter-colonial customs duties, he implemented a five per cent duty on the dividends of companies carrying out business in Western Australia to help raise the diminishing state revenue.\n\nIn February 1904, Gardiner attended the State Treasurers' Conference in Melbourne where, among other issues, he argued against changes to the system of collecting customs revenue, which would have reduced Western Australia's total [[revenue]] and increased the revenue of the other Australian states.<ref>''Weekly Times'' (Melbourne), 13 February 1904.</ref> He was forced to resign from parliament in April 1904 to reconsolidate his firm's business.\n\n==Midland Railway Company==\n\nFree of political responsibilities, Gardiner then began forging a significant working relationship with the [[Midland Railway of Western Australia|Midland Railway Company]] to promote land sales. His first association with the company was in July 1905, when he drafted a scheme for land sales. The company was in litigation with the [[Government of Western Australia|Western Australian Government]], which was claiming payments from the company for pastoral rents and licence fees. Gardiner negotiated with Premier [[Hector Rason]] and restrictions on land sales were withdrawn.<ref>[[Midland Railway of Western Australia|Midland Railway Co.]], London, Minute Book No. 4, p. 226, MN239/1, 1558A/3-8; [[Battye Library]].</ref> Gardiner pursued a scheme of land development and settlement for the company until 1918, including the Improved Farms Scheme to sell ready-made farms in [[Carnamah]], Winchester and [[Coorow]].<ref>Carnamah Historical Society & Museum, [http://www.carnamah.com.au/bio/james-gardiner-mla 'James Gardiner' in ''Biographical Dictionary of Coorow, Carnamah and Three Springs'']. Retrieved 21 November 2014.</ref>\n\n==Western Australian Country Party==\n\nDuring his association with the Midland Railway Company, Gardiner attempted a return to parliament in October 1911 when he contested the [[Electoral district of Irwin|seat of Irwin]]. Running against two other candidates, he lost to a Liberal rival.<ref name=\"David Black 1997\">[[David Black (historian)|Black D]]. & Prescott V. 1997, ''Election Statistics: Legislative Assembly of Western Australia 1890-1996'', Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project & Western Australian Electoral Commission.</ref> He became involved with the Farmers and Settlers' Association (FSA) of Western Australia. Gardiner presided over a conference in June 1912, which ratified the objectives of the FSA.<ref>Robertson J.R. 1964, 'The First Years of the Western Australian Country Party, 1912-1916', ''Historical Studies Australia and New Zealand'', v. 11, no. 43, pp. 343-360.</ref> In March 1913, the FSA formed its own political party to contest state and federal elections.<ref>Farmers and Settlers' Association of Western Australia 1913, ''Report of the Proceedings of the Special Conference Held at the Technical Schools, Perth, 12\u201314 March'', Perth; [[Battye Library]].</ref> The Western Australian Country Party was engineered as the political wing of the FSA, and the FSA president, A.J. Monger, was paramount in helping to found the party. Gardiner was a member of the FSA executive committee.\n\nIn 1914, a major drought had caused widespread failure of crops. The government was providing drought relief payments to all settlers except those settled by the Midland Railway Company, as the minister for lands, [[James Mitchell (Australian politician)|James Mitchell]], considered that the company should provide its own relief support.<ref>[[Midland Railway of Western Australia|Midland Railway Co.]], London, Minute Book No. 7, p. 143, MN239/1, 1558A/3-8; [[Battye Library]]</ref> Gardiner used his political influence to advantage when he interviewed Premier [[John Scaddan]] in September 1914 and managed to secure an advance from the government for seeding crops, feed and water supplies.\n\nIn October 1914, Gardiner was elected to parliament as the member for the [[Electoral district of Irwin|seat of Irwin]]. He was subsequently elected as the first parliamentary leader of the Country Party in Western Australia.<ref name=\"David Black 1997\"/> Increasingly, Gardiner took a pro-Labor stance to favour farmers in the newer wheatbelt areas, which drew further criticism of him from the government opposition, the government and from his own party.<ref>Robertson J.R. 1958, 'The Scaddan Government and the Conscription Crisis 1911-17: Aspects of Western Australia's Political History, MA thesis, University of Western Australia, Perth.</ref>\n\nA nervous breakdown in March 1915 forced Gardiner to resign as leader of the Western Australian Country Party. [[Francis Willmott]] was elected leader,<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120577b.htm Francis Willmott]</ref> and he led the Country Party to again adopt an anti-Labor stance. Upon his return to duties in June, Gardiner continued to serve in the party but persistently upheld Labor policies. Following a period of rebuilding his political status, he was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in March 1917 after the previous speaker, [[Bertie Johnston]], resigned.<ref>''Western Australian Parliamentary Debates'', 1917, v. 54, pp. 2019-2020.</ref> Gardiner's deafness was a disadvantage, and he was reappointed as colonial treasurer in June when the [[Lefroy Ministry]] was appointed.<ref>''Western Australian Parliamentary Debates'', 1917, v. 56.</ref>\n\n==National Country Party==\n\nDuring 1916 and early 1917, progress was made by the eastern states' country parties to form a national party. A proposed coalition of the Western Australian Country Party with the Liberal Party and [[National Labor Party]] in May 1917 was followed through by Gardiner. He led the Country Party into the [[Henry Lefroy|Lefroy]] coalition government, which comprised Liberal, Country Party and National Labor representatives.<ref>Graham B.D. 1966, ''The Formation of the Australian Country Parties'', Canberra: ANU Press, p. 106.</ref> Gardiner was elected unopposed in the general elections in September, representing the [[National Party of Australia (WA)|National Country Party]].\n\nIn January and February 1919, Gardiner was stranded in [[Melbourne]] for several weeks, owing to the [[Spanish flu|Spanish flu pandemic]] and a seamen's strike. The acting Western Australian premier, [[Hal Colebatch]], had implemented quarantine restrictions, which caused a great amount of friction with Gardiner. Gardiner resigned as treasurer on 1 April 1919,<ref>''[[The West Australian]]'', 2 April 1919.</ref> although he remained in the Legislative Assembly as a backbencher. He finally resigned from parliament on 12 March 1921.\n\nIn 1922 Gardiner was interviewed at the Honorary Royal Commission into the effect of the Federal compact upon the finances and industries of Western Australia.<ref>''[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]]'', 28 September 1922; ''[[The West Australian]]'', 29 September 1922.</ref> During 1924 he was appointed as an advisor to the Commonwealth Royal Commission on the finances of Western Australia, as affected by Federation.<ref>''[[The West Australian]]'', 1 December 1924; ''[[Albany Advertiser]]'', 3 December 1924.</ref>\n\nFollowing a three-year illness brought on by a stroke, he died on 27 October 1928 and was buried at [[Karrakatta Cemetery]].<ref>''[[The West Australian]]'', 30 October 1928.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Gardiner D. 2001, 'James Gardiner: Politics, Cricket and Land Sales', ''Early Days'', vol. 12, part 1, pp.&nbsp;47\u201359.\n*Gardiner D. 2001, ''Fireworks: The Life of James Gardiner'', Westralian Publishers, Perth. {{ISBN|0-9578580-1-9}}.\n*Gardiner D. 2018, ''Fireworks: The Honourable James Gardiner'', 2nd ed., Xmplar, Brisbane. {{ISBN|9780987351326}}.\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gardiner, James}}\n[[Category:1861 births]]\n[[Category:1928 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]\n[[Category:Speakers of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]\n[[Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:New Zealand emigrants to Australia]]\n[[Category:Burials at Karrakatta Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Treasurers of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Australian auctioneers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2017}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n|honorific-prefix = [[The Honourable]]\n|name        = James Gardiner\n|honorific-suffix = \n|image       = hon james gardiner.jpg\n|image_size     = 150px\n|office = [[Speaker of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Speaker of the Legislative Assembly]]<br/>of [[Western Australia]]\n|term_start  = 1 March\n|term_end    = 28 June 1917\n|predecessor = [[Bertie Johnston]]\n|successor   = [[George Taylor (Australian politician)|George Taylor]]\n|office2        = Leader of the [[National Party of Australia (WA)|Country Party]]<br/>in [[Western Australia]]\n|term_start2  = 21 October 1914\n|term_end2    = 18 March 1915\n|deputy2       = [[Francis Willmott]]\n|predecessor2 = None {{Small|(new position)}}\n|successor2   = Francis Willmott\n|office3 = Member of the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]]<br/>of [[Western Australia]]\n|constituency3 = [[Electoral district of Albany|Albany]]\n|term_start3  = 24 April 1901\n|term_end3    = 28 June 1904\n|predecessor3 = [[John Frederick Tasman Hassell|John Hassell]]\n|successor3   = [[Charles Keyser]]\n|constituency4 = [[Electoral district of Irwin|Irwin]]\n|term_start4  = 21 October 1914\n|term_end4    = 12 March 1921\n|predecessor4 = [[Samuel Moore (Australian politician)|Samuel Moore]]\n|successor4   = [[Charles Maley]]\n|birth_date         = {{birth date|df=yes|1861|6|12}}\n|birth_place        = [[Papakura]], New Zealand\n|death_date         = {{death date and age|df=yes|1928|10|27|1861|6|12}}\n|death_place        = [[Perth, Western Australia]]\n|party                 = [[Western Australian Liberal Party (1911\u20131917)|Liberal]] (1911)<br/>[[National Party of Australia (WA)|Country]] (from 1914)\n}}\n'''James Gardiner''' (12 June 1861 \u2013 27 October 1928) was an Australian politician who served in the [[Western Australian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] of [[Western Australia]] from 1901 to 1904 and from 1914 to 1921.

A new government under [[Walter James]] emerged in July 1902, and Gardiner was appointed [[Treasurer of Western Australia|colonial treasurer]]. Aware that [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] disadvantaged Western Australia due to the loss of revenue previously raised through inter-colonial customs duties, he implemented a five per cent duty on the dividends of companies carrying out business in Western Australia to help raise the diminishing state revenue.\n\nIn February 1904, Gardiner attended the State Treasurers' Conference in Melbourne where, among other issues, he argued against changes to the system of collecting customs revenue, which would have reduced Western Australia's total [[revenue]] and increased the revenue of the other Australian states.<ref>''Weekly Times'' (Melbourne), 13 February 1904.</ref> He was forced to resign from parliament in April 1904 to reconsolidate his firm's business.\n\n==Midland Railway Company==\n\nFree of political responsibilities, Gardiner then began forging a significant working relationship with the [[Midland Railway of Western Australia|Midland Railway Company]] to promote land sales. His first association with the company was in July 1905, when he drafted a scheme for land sales. The company was in litigation with the [[Government of Western Australia|Western Australian Government]], which was claiming payments from the company for pastoral rents and licence fees. Gardiner negotiated with Premier [[Hector Rason]] and restrictions on land sales were withdrawn.<ref>[[Midland Railway of Western Australia|Midland Railway Co.]], London, Minute Book No. 4, p. 226, MN239/1, 1558A/3-8; [[Battye Library]].</ref> Gardiner pursued a scheme of land development and settlement for the company until 1918, including the Improved Farms Scheme to sell ready-made farms in [[Carnamah]], Winchester and [[Coorow]].<ref>Carnamah Historical Society & Museum, [http://www.carnamah.com.au/bio/james-gardiner-mla 'James Gardiner' in ''Biographical Dictionary of Coorow, Carnamah and Three Springs'']. Retrieved 21 November 2014.</ref>\n\n==Western Australian Country Party==\n\nDuring his association with the Midland Railway Company, Gardiner attempted a return to parliament in October 1911 when he contested the [[Electoral district of Irwin|seat of Irwin]]. Running against two other candidates, he lost to a Liberal rival.<ref name=\"David Black 1997\">[[David Black (historian)|Black D]]. & Prescott V. 1997, ''Election Statistics: Legislative Assembly of Western Australia 1890-1996'', Perth: Western Australian Parliamentary History Project & Western Australian Electoral Commission.</ref> He became involved with the Farmers and Settlers' Association (FSA) of Western Australia. Gardiner presided over a conference in June 1912, which ratified the objectives of the FSA.<ref>Robertson J.R. 1964, 'The First Years of the Western Australian Country Party, 1912-1916', ''Historical Studies Australia and New Zealand'', v. 11, no. 43, pp. 343-360.</ref> In March 1913, the FSA formed its own political party to contest state and federal elections.<ref>Farmers and Settlers' Association of Western Australia 1913, ''Report of the Proceedings of the Special Conference Held at the Technical Schools, Perth, 12\u201314 March'', Perth; [[Battye Library]].</ref> The Western Australian Country Party was engineered as the political wing of the FSA, and the FSA president, A.J. Monger, was paramount in helping to found the party. Gardiner was a member of the FSA executive committee.\n\nIn 1914, a major drought had caused widespread failure of crops. The government was providing drought relief payments to all settlers except those settled by the Midland Railway Company, as the minister for lands, [[James Mitchell (Australian politician)|James Mitchell]], considered that the company should provide its own relief support.<ref>[[Midland Railway of Western Australia|Midland Railway Co.]], London, Minute Book No. 7, p. 143, MN239/1, 1558A/3-8; [[Battye Library]]</ref> Gardiner used his political influence to advantage when he interviewed Premier [[Scaddan|John Scaddan]] in September 1914 and managed to secure an advance from the government for seeding crops, feed and water supplies.\n\nIn October 1914, Gardiner was elected to parliament as the member for the [[Electoral district of Irwin|seat of Irwin]]. He was subsequently elected as the first parliamentary leader of the Country Party in Western Australia.<ref name=\"David Black 1997\"/> Increasingly, Gardiner took a pro-Labor stance to favour farmers in the newer wheatbelt areas, which drew further criticism of him from the government opposition, the government and from his own party.<ref>Robertson J.R. 1958, 'The Scaddan Government and the Conscription Crisis 1911-17: Aspects of Western Australia's Political History, MA thesis, University of Western Australia, Perth.</ref>\n\nA nervous breakdown in March 1915 forced Gardiner to resign as leader of the Western Australian Country Party. [[Francis Willmott]] was elected leader,<ref>[http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A120577b.htm Francis Willmott]</ref> and he led the Country Party to again adopt an anti-Labor stance. Upon his return to duties in June, Gardiner continued to serve in the party but persistently upheld Labor policies. Following a period of rebuilding his political status, he was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly in March 1917 after the previous speaker, [[Bertie Johnston]], resigned.<ref>''Western Australian Parliamentary Debates'', 1917, v. 54, pp. 2019-2020.</ref> Gardiner's deafness was a disadvantage, and he was reappointed as colonial treasurer in June when the [[Lefroy Ministry]] was appointed.<ref>''Western Australian Parliamentary Debates'', 1917, v. 56.</ref>\n\n==National Country Party==\n\nDuring 1916 and early 1917, progress was made by the eastern states' country parties to form a national party. A proposed coalition of the Western Australian Country Party with the Liberal Party and [[National Labor Party]] in May 1917 was followed through by Gardiner. He led the Country Party into the [[Henry Lefroy|Lefroy]] coalition government, which comprised Liberal, Country Party and National Labor representatives.<ref>Graham B.D. 1966, ''The Formation of the Australian Country Parties'', Canberra: ANU Press, p. 106.</ref> Gardiner was elected unopposed in the general elections in September, representing the [[National Party of Australia (WA)|National Country Party]].\n\nIn January and February 1919, Gardiner was stranded in [[Melbourne]] for several weeks, owing to the [[Spanish flu|Spanish flu pandemic]] and a seamen's strike. The acting Western Australian premier, [[Hal Colebatch]], had implemented quarantine restrictions, which caused a great amount of friction with Gardiner. Gardiner resigned as treasurer on 1 April 1919,<ref>''[[The West Australian]]'', 2 April 1919.</ref> although he remained in the Legislative Assembly as a backbencher. He finally resigned from parliament on 12 March 1921.\n\nIn 1922 Gardiner was interviewed at the Honorary Royal Commission into the effect of the Federal compact upon the finances and industries of Western Australia.<ref>''[[Daily News (Perth, Western Australia)|Daily News]]'', 28 September 1922; ''[[The West Australian]]'', 29 September 1922.</ref> During 1924 he was appointed as an advisor to the Commonwealth Royal Commission on the finances of Western Australia, as affected by Federation.<ref>''[[The West Australian]]'', 1 December 1924; ''[[Albany Advertiser]]'', 3 December 1924.</ref>\n\nFollowing a three-year illness brought on by a stroke, he died on 27 October 1928 and was buried at [[Karrakatta Cemetery]].<ref>''[[The West Australian]]'', 30 October 1928.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Gardiner D. 2001, 'James Gardiner: Politics, Cricket and Land Sales', ''Early Days'', vol. 12, part 1, pp.&nbsp;47\u201359.\n*Gardiner D. 2001, ''Fireworks: The Life of James Gardiner'', Westralian Publishers, Perth. {{ISBN|0-9578580-1-9}}.\n*Gardiner D. 2018, ''Fireworks: The Honourable James Gardiner'', 2nd ed., Xmplar, Brisbane. {{ISBN|9780987351326}}.\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gardiner, James}}\n[[Category:1861 births]]\n[[Category:1928 deaths]]\n[[Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]\n[[Category:Speakers of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly]]\n[[Category:National Party of Australia members of the Parliament of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:New Zealand emigrants to Australia]]\n[[Category:Burials at Karrakatta Cemetery]]\n[[Category:Treasurers of Western Australia]]\n[[Category:Australian auctioneers]]\n", "name_user": "Skaldis", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWestern Australian Country Party:wikilinkfix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gardiner_(Australian_politician)"}
