It centers on a family of anthropomorphic penguins who live at the South Pole, and the main character is the family's son and title character, Pingu.\n\nThe series originally ran for four series (each ''series'' is made up of multiple ''seasons'') from 28 May 1986 to 9 April 2000 on [[SF DRS]] and was then renewed for two more series from 1 August 2003 to 3 March 2006 on [[BBC Two]]. ''Pingu'' was also nominated for a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA award]]. The Pingu pilot episode first aired on Swiss television in 1986 and was later shown at the [[37th Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pingu.jp/biz/about/ |title=Official Pingu Website (Japan)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-otmar-gutmann-1512111.html |title=Obituary: Otmar Gutmann |date=21 October 1993 |access-date=6 January 2020 |first1=Silvio |last1=Mazzola |work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>\n\n''Pingu'' was very popular, due to its lack of a real spoken language: nearly all dialogue is in an invented [[grammelot]] \"penguin language\" referred to as 'Penguinese',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/television/2008/02/the_march_of_the_pingu.html |title=The March of the Pingu |first=Dana |last=Stevens |date=1 February 2008 |publisher= |accessdate=22 May 2017 |via=Slate}}</ref> consisting of babbling, muttering, and the titular character's characteristic sporadic loud honking noise, which can be popularly recognized as \"Noot noot!\" or other variants, stated to be \"Noo, Noo!\" by the defunct Pingu website's trivia page,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pingu.net/uk/pingu-facts.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202203656/http://www.pingu.net/uk/pingu-facts.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 February 2007 |title=Pingu Fact #5 (viewable in webpage source code)}}</ref> accompanied by turning his beak into a megaphone-like shape.<ref name=\"guardian_interview\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/11/how-we-made-pingu-childrens-tv-animation |title=How we made Pingu |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=27 June 2018 |first1=Andrew |last1=Dickson |first2=Ben |last2=Beaumont-Thomas |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Within the first 4 series, all the characters were performed by Italian voice actor [[Carlo Bonomi]], using a language of noises that he had already developed and used for the earlier [[Osvaldo Cavandoli]]'s ''[[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]]''. In series 5 and 6, the Pingu cast was jointly voiced by [[David Sant]] and Marcello Magni.<ref name=\"guardian_interview\" />\n\nA Japanese reboot of the series, titled ''[[Pingu in the City]]'', began airing on [[NHK|NHK-E]] on 7 October 2017.\n\n==Storyline==\n{{main|List of Pingu episodes}}\n{{:List of Pingu episodes}}\n\nThe programme is set in [[Antarctica]] and centres around penguin families living and working in [[igloo]]s. The main character, Pingu, belongs to one such family. He frequently goes on adventures with his little sister, Pinga, and often gets into mischief with his best friend, Robby the Seal.\n\n==Characters==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\nSome of the characters appearing in ''Pingu'' are given below.\n\n===Main===\n* Pingu is the main character of the series, a typically playful, sometimes naughty, curious little boy [[penguin]]. His name comes from the German word for penguin, ''{{lang|de|Pinguin}}''. He is strong-willed and mostly well-behaved but prone to making mischief and throwing occasional tantrums.\n* Pinga is Pingu's younger sister. She resembles an [[emperor penguin]] chick, as do other infant/toddler penguins throughout the show. Like all toddlers, she is happy and playful but very sensitive and clever, and is often a target for Pingu's practical jokes.\n* Mother and Father are Pingu and Pinga's parents; their actual names are not revealed. Father is a postman who uses a non-smoking pipe in the early episodes, but quits later. He is a short-tempered but loving penguin and has a motorised sledge ([[snowmobile]]) to deliver the mail, sometimes with help from Pingu. Mother is a caring, loving and hardworking housewife who spends most of her time cooking and cleaning. Mother sometimes gets help from Pingu and Pinga, and she always gives them a cuddle when they have learned a lesson.\n* Grandfather is Pingu and Pinga's paternal grandfather, who first appeared in the episode \"Music Lessons\". He is an expert accordionist, as he demonstrates to Pingu in that episode, and is also a former professional weight lifter.\n* Grandpa is Pingu and Pinga's maternal grandfather who appeared in \"Grandpa is Ill\" and \"Pingu Cannot Lose\", in the latter of which he is shown to be good at bowling.\n* Aunts are Mother's sisters and Pingu and Pinga's three maternal aunts. In \"Pingu Goes Away\", Pingu goes to stay with one of his aunts. In \"Pingu the Babysitter\", he cares for another aunt's twin chicks whilst she and Mother go out, then in \"Pingu Makes a Mistake\", he cares for his other aunt's egg that is due to hatch.\n* The Twins are Pingu and Pinga's cousins who appear in \"Pingu the Babysitter\" where they are cared for by Pingu when their mother (Pingu's aunt) goes out with Mother.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Robby is a [[Pinniped|seal]]. His name resembles the German word for seal, ''{{lang|de|Robbe}}''. First appearing in the episode \"Pingu Goes Fishing\", he is friendly and playful, yet cheeky in a lot of ways. He is bluish-grey in the first four seasons.\n* Pingo is a somewhat foolhardy penguin. He has a long beak that is essentially flat at the bottom but slightly rounded on the top and a head that is wider and taller. He often persuades Pingu to do wild and silly things with him.\n* Pingg is Pingu's other penguin friend. He also has a long beak, but a shorter head than Pingo.\n* Pongi is a penguin who wears glasses and has a short round beak. He first appeared in the episode \"Ice Hockey\".\n* Pengy is a penguin very similar to [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]s, and first appears in \"Pingu and the School Excursion\". In the episode \"School Time\", Pingu resembles Pengy.\n* Pingj is a green penguin who appears in ''Pingu at the Wedding Party''; he speaks with an accent that seems to be typical of his race.\n* Punki is a penguin who first appeared in the episode \"Pingu Delivers The Mail\". He has a tuft on his head and wears striped trousers. Punki only appears in a handful of episodes.\n* Bajoo is Pingu's other non-penguin friend. [[HIT Entertainment]] reveals him as a \"strange newcomer\" to the Antarctic in the appearance of an [[Yeti|abominable snowman]]. He debuted in 2005, and appeared in the final episode, \"Pingu & the Abominable Snowman\". He also appeared in the 7\u201311 music video and \"The Pingu Show\".\n* Pingi is Pingu's love interest and Pinga's best friend. She has thick, white eyelashes and a somewhat mushed beak. She first appeared in the episode \"Pingu's Admirer\".\n\n===Supporting===\n* The Schoolmaster (Mr. Peng-Chips) is Pingu's teacher. He lives in a nearby school and rings the bell when it is time for school to begin or end. He first appeared in the episode \"School Time\".\n* The Doctor is the neighborhood's doctor. He lives in a nearby igloo clinic and frequently treats Pingu's injuries, as well as aid in the birth of Pinga.\n* Mr. Peng-Hoven is a poor penguin. He lives in a tattered igloo and gladly accepts Pingu's gifts. He first appeared in \"Pingu and the Barrel Organ\".\n* The Giant Walrus is a mysterious German character who appeared in the episode \"Pingu's Dream\". As Pingu sleeps, he dreams his bed comes to life and takes him on a ride, unaware that the giant non-tusked walrus is stalking him. He eventually shows up and confronts him before trapping him in an igloo. He lets him out and uses him as a stretch toy while laughing maniacally. The walrus then eats Pingu's mattress, allowing Pingu to escape. Pingu then falls down a slope and wakes up in the real world, where his mother consoles him after his nightmare.\n\n==Production history==\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=December 2017}}\nThe original production from 1988&ndash;2000 and 2003&ndash;2006 created 156 five-minute episodes and [[Pingu at the Wedding Party|one special 25-minute episode]]. The episodes were written by [[Silvio Mazzola]] and were directed and animated by [[Otmar Gutmann]] using [[clay animation]], at [[Trickfilmstudio]] in [[Russikon]], Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/5681/pinguFAQ.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Pingu |accessdate=21 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310140008/http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/5681/pinguFAQ.html |archivedate=10 March 2008}}</ref> In the style of voices a [[Retroscripting|retroscript]] was chosen, and all voices were performed by Italian voice actor [[Carlo Bonomi]] without a script, using a language of noises that he had already developed and used for [[Osvaldo Cavandoli]]'s ''[[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]]''. This feature enables people of different linguistic backgrounds to be able to follow the story.\n\nIn 1993, [[David Hasselhoff]] released a single titled \"Pingu Dance\",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727162700/http://www.david-hasselhoff.com/multimedia.html Music- & Soundfiles / Musik- & Sounddateien]. david-hasselhoff.com</ref> a [[hip hop music|rap]] song (in Switzerland only) based on the ''Pingu'' shorts and featuring samples of Penguinese. A portion of this song is used as the theme to ''Pingu'' in international airings, and was also heard in the re-dubbed version of the \"Pingu Looks After the Egg (retitled Pingu Helps with Incubating)\" episode, replacing the \"[[Woodpeckers from Space]]\" song from the original version.\n\nA special twenty-five-minute episode, ''[[Pingu at the Wedding Party]]'', was also produced in 1997, and introduced a family of green penguins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/pingu-family-at-the-wedding-party/ |title=Pingu Family at the Wedding Party |work=ABC Television}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2001, [[HIT Entertainment]] bought the rights to the series, including the original 104 episodes and the wedding special, for \u00a315.9 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pingu sold for \u00a316m |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1626014.stm |work=Business |publisher=BBC News |date=29 October 2001 |accessdate=21 July 2007}}</ref> HIT later revived the show, and produced a further 52 episodes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hit-entertainment-plc-announces-record-year-end-2002-results-76228802.html |title=HIT Entertainment PLC Announces Record Year End 2002 Results |author=HIT Entertainment PLC |date=14 October 2002 |work=prnewswire.com}}</ref> created at [[Hot Animation]] Studios in 2003 through 2006.

CBeebies airs only the original version of ''Pingu'' with the original cartoon title card (series 1 and 2) from the 52 episodes, and shows the first 13 episodes of series 3 with the claymation inspiration intro. [[JimJam]] contains all of the show's 156 episodes and [[Pingu at the Wedding Party]], but it contains the re-dubbed versions of series 1\u20132 and contains the original version of [[Pingu at the Wedding Party]], without the titles and credits.\n\nContrary to some sources, there was never any CGI used in these later episodes. When HIT Entertainment bought the rights, [[Carlo Bonomi]] was replaced with new voice actors Marcello Magni and [[David Sant]]. Magni and Sant, Italian and Spanish actors based in London, both have a mime and clowning background and were already aware of the clown language of \"[[Grammelot]]\" on which the penguin language was based.<ref name=\"guardian_interview\"/>\n\nIn 2006, after the last episode aired, ''Pingu'' finally ended its 16-year run on TV.\n\n''Pingu'' had aired on [[Nickelodeon (UK & Ireland)|Nickelodeon]] in the UK for a period of time in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nickelodeon.co.uk/schedule/wday3.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980204185916/http://www.nickelodeon.co.uk/schedule/wday3.htm |title=What's on Nickelodeon UK |archivedate=4 February 1998 |work=nickelodeon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe very first time Pingu was ever mentioned in the US was on a documentary called Pingu - A Cartoon Character who conquers the world<ref>{{Citation |last=Sandro Mazzola |title=Pingu - a cartoon character conquers the world |date=24 February 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvJqiGKo7Hw |accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref> where a detective tries to figure out why Pingu is so popular, at the time Pingu was shown at the Paley Center. Then the series began airing in the United States on a morning omnibus program titled ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', as part of [[Cartoon Network]]'s Sunday morning lineup. The program featured various animated shorts produced internationally, and ran from 1996 until the show's discontinuation in 2001. The series did not air in the US from 2002 until 2005, when reruns of the series returned to the country on [[PBS Kids Sprout]], but was removed sometime in 2010.

It centers on a family of anthropomorphic penguins who live at the South Pole, and the main character is the family's son and title character, Pingu.\n\nThe series originally ran for four series (each ''series'' is made up of multiple ''seasons'') from 28 May 1986 to 9 April 2000 on [[SF DRS]] and was then renewed for two more series from 1 August 2003 to 3 March 2006 on [[BBC Two]]. ''Pingu'' was also nominated for a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA award]].

The main character, Pingu, belongs to one such family. He frequently goes on adventures with his little sister, Pinga, and often gets into mischief with his best friend, Robby the Seal.\n\n==Characters==\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2019}}\nSome of the characters appearing in ''Pingu'' are given below.\n\n===Main===\n* Pingu is the main character of the series, a typically playful, sometimes naughty, curious little boy [[penguin]]. His name comes from the German word for penguin, ''{{lang|de|Pinguin}}''. He is strong-willed and mostly well-behaved but prone to making mischief and throwing occasional tantrums.\n* Pinga is Pingu's younger sister. She resembles an [[emperor penguin]] chick, as do other infant/toddler penguins throughout the show. Like all toddlers, she is happy and playful but very sensitive and clever, and is often a target for Pingu's practical jokes.\n* Mother and Father are Pingu and Pinga's parents; their actual names are not revealed. Father is a postman who uses a non-smoking pipe in the early episodes, but quits later. He is a short-tempered but loving penguin and has a motorised sledge ([[snowmobile]]) to deliver the mail, sometimes with help from Pingu. Mother is a caring, loving and hardworking housewife who spends most of her time cooking and cleaning. Mother sometimes gets help from Pingu and Pinga, and she always gives them a cuddle when they have learned a lesson.\n* Grandfather is Pingu and Pinga's paternal grandfather, who first appeared in the episode \"Music Lessons\". He is an expert accordionist, as he demonstrates to Pingu in that episode, and is also a former professional weight lifter.\n* Grandpa is Pingu and Pinga's maternal grandfather who appeared in \"Grandpa is Ill\" and \"Pingu Cannot Lose\", in the latter of which he is shown to be good at bowling.\n* Aunts are Mother's sisters and Pingu and Pinga's three maternal aunts. In \"Pingu Goes Away\", Pingu goes to stay with one of his aunts. In \"Pingu the Babysitter\", he cares for another aunt's twin chicks whilst she and Mother go out, then in \"Pingu Makes a Mistake\", he cares for his other aunt's egg that is due to hatch.\n* The Twins are Pingu and Pinga's cousins who appear in \"Pingu the Babysitter\" where they are cared for by Pingu when their mother (Pingu's aunt) goes out with Mother.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Robby is a [[Pinniped|seal]]. His name resembles the German word for seal, ''{{lang|de|Robbe}}''. First appearing in the episode \"Pingu Goes Fishing\", he is friendly and playful, yet cheeky in a lot of ways. He is bluish-grey in the first four seasons.\n* Pingo is a somewhat foolhardy penguin. He has a long beak that is essentially flat at the bottom but slightly rounded on the top and a head that is wider and taller. He often persuades Pingu to do wild and silly things with him.\n* Pingg is Pingu's other penguin friend. He also has a long beak, but a shorter head than Pingo.\n* Pongi is a penguin who wears glasses and has a short round beak. He first appeared in the episode \"Ice Hockey\".\n* Pengy is a penguin very similar to [[Ad\u00e9lie penguin]]s, and first appears in \"Pingu and the School Excursion\". In the episode \"School Time\", Pingu resembles Pengy.\n* Pingj is a green penguin who appears in ''Pingu at the Wedding Party''; he speaks with an accent that seems to be typical of his race.\n* Punki is a penguin who first appeared in the episode \"Pingu Delivers The Mail\". He has a tuft on his head and wears striped trousers. Punki only appears in a handful of episodes.\n* Bajoo is Pingu's other non-penguin friend. [[HIT Entertainment]] reveals him as a \"strange newcomer\" to the Antarctic in the appearance of an [[Yeti|abominable snowman]]. He debuted in 2005, and appeared in the final episode, \"Pingu & the Abominable Snowman\". He also appeared in the 7\u201311 music video and \"The Pingu Show\".\n* Pingi is Pingu's love interest and Pinga's best friend. She has thick, white eyelashes and a somewhat mushed beak. She first appeared in the episode \"Pingu's Admirer\".\n\n===Supporting===\n* The Schoolmaster (Mr. Peng-Chips) is Pingu's teacher. He lives in a nearby school and rings the bell when it is time for school to begin or end. He first appeared in the episode \"School Time\".\n* The Doctor is the neighborhood's doctor. He lives in a nearby igloo clinic and frequently treats Pingu's injuries, as well as aid in the birth of Pinga.\n* Mr. Peng-Hoven is a poor penguin. He lives in a tattered igloo and gladly accepts Pingu's gifts. He first appeared in \"Pingu and the Barrel Organ\".\n* The Giant Walrus is a mysterious German character who appeared in the episode \"Pingu's Dream\". As Pingu sleeps, he dreams his bed comes to life and takes him on a ride, unaware that the giant non-tusked walrus is stalking him. He eventually shows up and confronts him before trapping him in an igloo. He lets him out and uses him as a stretch toy while laughing maniacally. The walrus then eats Pingu's mattress, allowing Pingu to escape. Pingu then falls down a slope and wakes up in the real world, where his mother consoles him after his nightmare.\n\n==Production history==\n{{cleanup rewrite|date=December 2017}}\nThe original production from 1988&ndash;2000 and 2003&ndash;2006 created 156 five-minute episodes and [[Pingu at the Wedding Party|one special 25-minute episode]]. The episodes were written by [[Silvio Mazzola]] and were directed and animated by [[Otmar Gutmann]] using [[clay animation]], at [[Trickfilmstudio]] in [[Russikon]], Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/5681/pinguFAQ.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Pingu |accessdate=21 July 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310140008/http://www.geocities.com/EnchantedForest/5681/pinguFAQ.html |archivedate=10 March 2008}}</ref> In the style of voices a [[Retroscripting|retroscript]] was chosen, and all voices were performed by Italian voice actor [[Carlo Bonomi]] without a script, using a language of noises that he had already developed and used for [[Osvaldo Cavandoli]]'s ''[[La Linea (TV series)|La Linea]]''. This feature enables people of different linguistic backgrounds to be able to follow the story.\n\nIn 1993, [[David Hasselhoff]] released a single titled \"Pingu Dance\",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110727162700/http://www.david-hasselhoff.com/multimedia.html Music- & Soundfiles / Musik- & Sounddateien]. david-hasselhoff.com</ref> a [[hip hop music|rap]] song (in Switzerland only) based on the ''Pingu'' shorts and featuring samples of Penguinese. A portion of this song is used as the theme to ''Pingu'' in international airings, and was also heard in the re-dubbed version of the \"Pingu Looks After the Egg (retitled Pingu Helps with Incubating)\" episode, replacing the \"[[Woodpeckers from Space]]\" song from the original version.\n\nA special twenty-five-minute episode, ''[[Pingu at the Wedding Party]]'', was also produced in 1997, and introduced a family of green penguins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/programs/pingu-family-at-the-wedding-party/ |title=Pingu Family at the Wedding Party |work=ABC Television}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2001, [[HIT Entertainment]] bought the rights to the series, including the original 104 episodes and the wedding special, for \u00a315.9 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pingu sold for \u00a316m |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1626014.stm |work=Business |publisher=BBC News |date=29 October 2001 |accessdate=21 July 2007}}</ref> HIT later revived the show, and produced a further 52 episodes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hit-entertainment-plc-announces-record-year-end-2002-results-76228802.html |title=HIT Entertainment PLC Announces Record Year End 2002 Results |author=HIT Entertainment PLC |date=14 October 2002 |work=prnewswire.com}}</ref> created at [[Hot Animation]] Studios in 2003 through 2006.

When HIT Entertainment bought the rights, [[Carlo Bonomi]] was replaced with new voice actors Marcello Magni and [[David Sant]]. Magni and Sant, Italian and Spanish actors based in London, both have a mime and clowning background and were already aware of the clown language of \"[[Grammelot]]\" on which the penguin language was based.<ref name=\"guardian_interview\"/>\n\nIn 2006, after the last episode aired, ''Pingu'' finally ended its 16-year run on TV.\n\n''Pingu'' had aired on [[Nickelodeon (UK & Ireland)|Nickelodeon]] in the UK for a period of time in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nickelodeon.co.uk/schedule/wday3.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19980204185916/http://www.nickelodeon.co.uk/schedule/wday3.htm |title=What's on Nickelodeon UK |archivedate=4 February 1998 |work=nickelodeon.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe very first time Pingu was ever mentioned in the US was on a documentary called Pingu - A Cartoon Character who conquers the world<ref>{{Citation |last=Sandro Mazzola |title=Pingu - a cartoon character conquers the world |date=24 February 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvJqiGKo7Hw |accessdate=4 February 2018}}</ref> where a detective tries to figure out why Pingu is so popular, at the time Pingu was shown at the Paley Center. Then the series began airing in the United States on a morning omnibus program titled ''[[Small World (U.S. TV series)|Small World]]'', as part of [[Cartoon Network]]'s Sunday morning lineup. The program featured various animated shorts produced internationally, and ran from 1996 until the show's discontinuation in 2001. The series did not air in the US from 2002 until 2005, when reruns of the series returned to the country on [[PBS Kids Sprout]], but was removed sometime in 2010.

It can still be seen on TV in that country since [[Aboriginal Peoples Television Network|APTN]] airs \"The Pingu Show\" as part of its morning children's programming block \"APTN Kids\", and the show is available in English and [[French language]] versions.
