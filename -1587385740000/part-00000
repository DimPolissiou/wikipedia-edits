This was followed by numerous [[Latin American wars of independence]] in the early 1800s. Between 1811 and 1825, [[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Gran Colombia]], the [[United Provinces of Central America]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]] gained independence from Spain and Portugal in armed revolutions. After the [[Dominican War of Independence|Dominican Republic won independence from Haiti]], it was re-annexed by Spain in 1861, but reclaimed its independence in 1865 at the conclusion of the [[Dominican Restoration War]]. The last violent episode of decolonization was the [[Cuban War of Independence]] which became the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which resulted in the independence of [[Cuba]] in 1898, and the transfer of sovereignty over [[Puerto Rico]] from Spain to the United States.\n\nPeaceful decolonization began with the purchase by the [[United States]] of [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana from France]] in 1803, [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Florida from Spain]] in 1819, of [[Alaska purchase|Alaska from Russia]] in 1867, and the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies|Danish West Indies from Denmark]] in 1916. [[Canada]] became independent of the United Kingdom, starting with the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], and ending with the [[patriation of the Canadian Constitution]] in 1982. The [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] similarly achieved partial independence under the Balfour Declaration and Statute of Westminster, but was re-absorbed into the United Kingdom in 1934. It was subsequently [[Newfoundland Act|confederated with Canada]] in 1949.\n\nThe remaining European colonies in the Caribbean began to achieve peaceful independence well after [[World War II]]. [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]] became independent in 1962, and [[Guyana]] and [[Barbados]] both achieved independence in 1966. In the 1970s, the [[Bahamas]], [[Grenada]], [[Dominica]], [[St. Lucia]], and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]] all became independent of the United Kingdom, and [[Suriname]] became independent of the Netherlands. [[Belize]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], and [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]] achieved independence from the United Kingdom in the 1980s.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Further|Geography of North America|Geography of South America}}\n[[File:Earth-DSCOVR-20150706-IFV.jpg|thumb|Satellite photo of the Americas]]\n\n=== Extent ===\nThe Americas make up most of the land in Earth's [[western hemisphere]].<ref>\n*{{citation|title=Merriam-Webster's Geographical Dictionary|year=2001|quote=The part of the Earth comprising North and South America and surrounding waters; longitudes 20\u00b0W and 160\u00b0E are often considered its boundaries|page=1294|contribution=Western Hemisphere|edition=3rd|place=Springfield, MA|publisher=Merriam-Webster}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Chambers Dictionary|date=2011|publisher=Chambers Harrap Publishers, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-550-10237-9|edition=12|location=London|page=1780|editor1-last=O'Neal|editor1-first=Mary}}\n*{{cite book|url=http://www.worldbook.com|title=The World Book Dictionary|date=2003|publisher=World Book, Inc|isbn=0-7166-0299-7|location=Chicago|page=2377|quote=Western Hemisphere, the half of the world that includes North and South America.}}\n*{{cite book|title=The American Heritage College Dictionary|date=2010|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-618-83595-9|edition=Fourth|location=Boston|page=1557|quote=Western Hemisphere The half of the earth comprising North America, Central America, and South America}}\n*{{cite book|title=New Oxford American Dictionary|date=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=Third|location=New York|page=1963|quote=The Half of the earth that contains the Americas|editor1-last=Stevenson|editor1-first=Angus|editor2-last=Lindberg|editor2-first=Christine A.}}\n*{{cite book|title=Webster's New World College Dictionary|date=2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-544-16606-6|edition=Fifth|location=Boston|quote=Western Hemisphere that half of the earth which includes North & South America}}</ref> The northernmost point of the Americas is [[Kaffeklubben Island]], which is the most northerly point of land on Earth.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Burress |first=Charles |url = http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/06/17/BAG4J779M31.DTL&type=science|title = Romancing the north Berkeley explorer may have stepped on ancient Thule|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date = June 17, 2004}}</ref> The southernmost point is the islands of [[Southern Thule]], although they are sometimes considered part of [[Antarctica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coolantarctica.com/Travel/south_georgia_south_sandwich_islands.htm|title=South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, Antarctica \u2013 Travel|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219114729/http://www.coolantarctica.com/Travel/south_georgia_south_sandwich_islands.htm |archivedate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> The mainland of the Americas is the world's longest north-to-south landmass.

The largest river basin in North America is that of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], covering the second largest [[Drainage basin|watershed]] on the planet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biology.usgs.gov/s+t/SNT/noframe/ms137.htm |title=Mississippi River |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715014306/http://biology.usgs.gov/s%2Bt/SNT/noframe/ms137.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2007 }}</ref> The Mississippi-Missouri river system drains most of 31 states of the U.S., most of the [[Great Plains]], and large areas between the Rocky and Appalachian mountains. This river is the [[List of rivers by length|fourth longest in the world]] and [[List of rivers by discharge|tenth most powerful in the world]].\n\nIn North America, to the east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], there are no major rivers but rather a series of rivers and streams that flow east with their terminus in the Atlantic Ocean, such as the [[Hudson River]], [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River]], and [[Savannah River]]. A similar instance arises with central Canadian rivers that drain into [[Hudson Bay]]; the largest being the [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]]. On the west coast of North America, the main rivers are the [[Colorado River]], [[Columbia River]], [[Yukon River]], [[Fraser River]], and [[Sacramento River]].\n\nThe Colorado River drains much of the [[Southern Rockies]] and parts of the Great [[Basin and Range Province]]. The river flows approximately {{convert|1450|mi|km|sp=us}} into the [[Gulf of California]],<ref name=largest>{{cite web |last= Kammerer |first= J.C. |title= Largest Rivers in the United States |url= http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1987/ofr87-242/ |publisher= United States Geological Survey |accessdate=July 2, 2010}}</ref> during which over time it has carved out natural phenomena such as the [[Grand Canyon]] and created phenomena such as the [[Salton Sea]]. The Columbia is a large river, {{convert|1243|mi|km}} long, in central western North America and is the most powerful river on the West Coast of the Americas.

Initially, the exchange of biota was roughly equal, with North American genera migrating into South America in about the same proportions as South American genera migrated into North America. This exchange is known as the [[Great American Interchange]]. The exchange became lopsided after roughly a million years, with the total spread of South American genera into North America far more limited in scope than the spread on North American genera into South America.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Ecogeography and the Great American Interchange | last = Webb | first = S.

Small enclaves of [[French language|French]]-, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]- and [[English language|English]]-speaking regions also exist in Latin America, notably in [[French Guiana]], [[Suriname]], and [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]] respectively. [[Haitian Creole]] is dominant in the nation of [[Haiti]], where French is also spoken. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native languages]] are more prominent in Latin America than in [[Anglo-America]], with [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] as the most common. Various other native languages are spoken with less frequency across both Anglo-America and Latin America. [[Creole language]]s other than Haitian Creole are also spoken in parts of Latin America.\n\nThe dominant language of Anglo-America is English. French is also official in [[Canada]], where it is the predominant language in [[Quebec]] and an official language in [[New Brunswick]] along with English. It is also an important language in [[Louisiana]], and in parts of [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]]. Spanish has kept an ongoing presence in the [[Southwestern United States]], which formed part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], especially in [[Californio|California]] and [[New Mexico]], where [[New Mexican Spanish|a distinct variety of Spanish]] spoken since the 17th century has survived. It has more recently become widely spoken in other parts of the [[United States]] because of heavy immigration from Latin America. High levels of immigration in general have brought great linguistic diversity to Anglo-America, with over 300 languages known to be spoken in the United States alone, but most languages are spoken only in small enclaves and by relatively small immigrant groups.\n\nThe nations of Guyana, Suriname, and Belize are generally considered{{by whom|date=July 2012}} not to fall into either Anglo-America or Latin America because of their language differences from Latin America, geographic differences from Anglo-America, and cultural and historical differences from both regions; English is the primary language of Guyana and Belize, and Dutch is the primary language of Suriname.\n\nMost of the non-native languages have, to different degrees, evolved differently from the mother country, but are usually still mutually intelligible. Some have combined, however, which has even resulted in completely new languages, such as [[Papiamento]], which is a combination of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch (representing the respective colonizers), native [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], various [[African languages]], and, more recently English. The [[lingua franca]] [[Portu\u00f1ol]], a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish, is spoken in the border regions of Brazil and neighboring Spanish-speaking countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2006|title=Too Close for Comfort?

This was followed by numerous [[Latin American wars of independence]] in the early 1800s. Between 1811 and 1825, [[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Gran Colombia]], the [[United Provinces of Central America]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Peru]], and [[Bolivia]] gained independence from Spain and Portugal in armed revolutions. After the [[Dominican War of Independence|Dominican Republic won independence from Haiti]], it was re-annexed by Spain in 1861, but reclaimed its independence in 1865 at the conclusion of the [[Dominican Restoration War]]. The last violent episode of decolonization was the [[Cuban War of Independence]] which became the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which resulted in the independence of [[Cuba]] in 1898, and the transfer of sovereignty over [[Puerto Rico]] from Spain to the United States.\n\nPeaceful decolonization began with the purchase by the [[United States]] of [[Louisiana Purchase|Louisiana from France]] in 1803, [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Florida from Spain]] in 1819, of [[Alaska purchase|Alaska from Russia]] in 1867, and the [[Treaty of the Danish West Indies|Danish West Indies from Denmark]] in 1916. [[Canada]] became independent of the United Kingdom, starting with the [[Balfour Declaration of 1926]], [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], and ending with the [[patriation of the Canadian Constitution]] in 1982. The [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] similarly achieved partial independence under the Balfour Declaration and Statute of Westminster, but was re-absorbed into the United Kingdom in 1934. It was subsequently [[Newfoundland Act|confederated with Canada]] in 1949.\n\nThe remaining European colonies in the Caribbean began to achieve peaceful independence well after [[World War II]].

Small enclaves of [[French language|French]]-, [[Dutch language|Dutch]]- and [[English language|English]]-speaking regions also exist in Latin America, notably in [[French Guiana]], [[Suriname]], and [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]] respectively. [[Haitian Creole]] is dominant in the nation of [[Haiti]], where French is also spoken. [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native languages]] are more prominent in Latin America than in [[Anglo-America]], with [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] as the most common. Various other native languages are spoken with less frequency across both Anglo-America and Latin America. [[Creole language]]s other than Haitian Creole are also spoken in parts of Latin America.\n\nThe dominant language of Anglo-America is English. French is also official in [[Canada]], where it is the predominant language in [[Quebec]] and an official language in [[New Brunswick]] along with English. It is also an important language in [[Louisiana]], and in parts of [[New Hampshire]], [[Maine]], and [[Vermont]]. Spanish has kept an ongoing presence in the [[Southwestern United States]], which formed part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], especially in [[Californio|California]] and [[New Mexico]], where [[New Mexican Spanish|a distinct variety of Spanish]] spoken since the 17th century has survived. It has more recently become widely spoken in other parts of the [[United States]] because of heavy immigration from Latin America. High levels of immigration in general have brought great linguistic diversity to Anglo-America, with over 300 languages known to be spoken in the United States alone, but most languages are spoken only in small enclaves and by relatively small immigrant groups.\n\nThe nations of Guyana, Suriname, and Belize are generally considered{{by whom|date=July 2012}} not to fall into either Anglo-America or Latin America because of their language differences from Latin America, geographic differences from Anglo-America, and cultural and historical differences from both regions; English is the primary language of Guyana and Belize, and Dutch is the primary language of Suriname.\n\nMost of the non-native languages have, to different degrees, evolved differently from the mother country, but are usually still mutually intelligible. Some have combined, however, which has even resulted in completely new languages, such as [[Papiamento]], which is a combination of Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch (representing the respective colonizers), native [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]], various [[African languages]], and, more recently English. The [[lingua franca]] [[Portu\u00f1ol]], a mixture of Portuguese and Spanish, is spoken in the border regions of Brazil and neighboring Spanish-speaking countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2006|title=Too Close for Comfort?

[[Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark|Ulrika Eleonora]] and [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] had their children baptized in different rounds, first straight after the birth, and then a bit later at the formal ceremony.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1864 it was determined that all baptisms should take place within six weeks from the birth, a tradition that was maintained by the Royal family until the baptism of [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]] in 1946. He was baptized first eleven weeks after his birth. The royal children, [[Victoria of Sweden|crown princess Victoria]], [[Prince Carl Philip, Duke of V\u00e4rmland|prince Carl Philip]] and [[Princess Madeleine, Duchess of H\u00e4lsingland and G\u00e4strikland|princess Madeleine]] were also baptized between eleven and fifteen weeks after they were born. The baptism of royal children is about more than tradition. The order of succession states that all members of the royal family must \"confess to the true evangelic faith\", or the right to the throne is lost. Many royal baptisms have taken place in the [[Royal Chapel (Sweden)|Royal Chapel]], with a few exceptions.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last1=Rangstr\u00f6m|first1=Lena|title=Kanonsalut och vaggor: kungliga f\u00f6dslar och dop|date=2012|publisher=Livrustkammaren/Atlantis|isbn=9789173535588}}</ref>\n\n== Appearance ==\nSilver was long to equate with the colour white in royal ceremonies. White long had a deep symbolic meaning in Christian contexts, the colour stood for light, virginity and purity. Silver cloths were therefore often used for [[swaddling]] infants and to carry as a canopy over parts of the baptism party.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Charles XI's cradle ==\nIn 1655 the future Charles XI received a cradle as a christening gift from his mothers parents.

[[Ulrika Eleonora of Denmark|Ulrika Eleonora]] and [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] had their children baptized in different rounds, first straight after the birth, and then a bit later at the formal ceremony.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1864 it was determined that all baptisms should take place within six weeks from the birth, a tradition that was maintained by the Royal family until the baptism of [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]] in 1946. He was baptized first eleven weeks after his birth. The royal children, [[Victoria of Sweden|crown princess Victoria]], [[Prince Carl Philip, Duke of V\u00e4rmland|prince Carl Philip]] and [[Princess Madeleine, Duchess of H\u00e4lsingland and G\u00e4strikland|princess Madeleine]] were also baptized between eleven and fifteen weeks after they were born. The baptism of royal children is about more than tradition. The order of succession states that all members of the royal family must \"confess to the true evangelic faith\", or the right to the throne is lost. Many royal baptisms have taken place in the [[Royal Chapel (Sweden)|Royal Chapel]], with a few exceptions.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|last1=Rangstr\u00f6m|first1=Lena|title=Kanonsalut och vaggor: kungliga f\u00f6dslar och dop|date=2012|publisher=Livrustkammaren/Atlantis|isbn=9789173535588}}</ref>\n\n== Appearance ==\nSilver was long to equate with the colour white in royal ceremonies. White long had a deep symbolic meaning in Christian contexts, the colour stood for light, virginity and purity. Silver cloths were therefor often used for [[swaddling]] infants and to carry as a canopy over parts of the baptism party.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Charles XI's cradle ==\nIn 1655 the future Charles XI received a cradle as a christening gift from his mothers parents. It is exhibited at the [[Livrustkammaren|Royal Armoury]] in Stockholm, and it is the only item that still is in use. The cradle is made out of sculptured, gold plated and painted wood.<ref name=\":0\" /> The last time it was used was at [[Princess Estelle, Duchess of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland|Princess Estelle's]] baptism on May 22, 2012.

Schabacker published several books which continued the work of [[Charles Dow]] and [[William Peter Hamilton]] in their books ''Stock Market Theory and Practice'' and ''Technical Market Analysis''.  In 1948, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published ''Technical Analysis of Stock Trends'' which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline.  It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of [[point and figure chart]] analysis.  With the emergence of behavioural finance as a separate discipline in economics, Paul V. Azzopardi combined technical analysis with behavioural finance and coined the term \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\".<ref> Paul V. Azzopardi, \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\", ibid</ref>\n\n[[Dow theory]] is based on the collected writings of [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] co-founder and editor Charles Dow, and inspired the use and development of modern technical analysis at the end of the 19th century. Other pioneers of analysis techniques include [[Ralph Nelson Elliott]], [[William Delbert Gann]] and [[Richard Wyckoff]] who developed their respective techniques in the early 20th century. More technical tools and theories have been developed and enhanced in recent decades, with an increasing emphasis on computer-assisted techniques using specially designed computer software.\n\n==General description==\nFundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, assets, quality, ratio, new products, research and the like. Technicians employ many methods, tools and techniques as well, one of which is the use of charts.  Using charts, technical analysts seek to identify price patterns and [[market trend]]s in financial markets and attempt to exploit those patterns.<ref name=Murphy>Murphy, John J. ''Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets''.  New York Institute of Finance, 1999, pp. 1-5, 24-31. {{ISBN|0-7352-0066-1}}</ref>\n\nTechnicians using charts search for archetypal price chart patterns, such as the well-known [[Head and shoulders (chart pattern)|head and shoulders]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://primepair.com/trading-education/forex-analysis/technical-analysis#Head_and_Shoulders |title=PrimePair.com Head and Shoulders Pattern |access-date=2015-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106114558/http://primepair.com/trading-education/forex-analysis/technical-analysis#Head_and_Shoulders#Head_and_Shoulders |archive-date=2015-01-06 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> or [[double top and double bottom|double top/bottom]] reversal patterns, study [[technical indicator]]s, [[moving average]]s, and look for forms such as lines of support, resistance, channels, and more obscure formations such as [[Flag and pennant patterns#The Flag Pattern|flags]], [[Flag and pennant patterns#Pennant pattern|pennants]], balance days and [[cup and handle]] patterns.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part III: Classical Chart Analysis}}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysts also widely use market indicators of many sorts, some of which are mathematical transformations of price, often including up and down volume, advance/decline data and other inputs. These indicators are used to help assess whether an asset is trending, and if it is, the probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators.  Examples include the [[moving average]], [[relative strength index]], and [[MACD]]. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in Options ([[implied volatility]]) and put/call ratios with price. Also important are sentiment indicators such as Put/Call ratios, bull/bear ratios, short interest, Implied Volatility, etc.\n\nThere are many techniques in technical analysis. Adherents of different techniques (for example: Candlestick analysis, the oldest form of technical analysis developed by a Japanese grain trader; [[Harmonics]]; [[Dow theory]]; and [[Elliott wave theory]]) may ignore the other approaches, yet many traders combine elements from more than one technique. Some technical analysts use subjective judgment to decide which pattern(s) a particular instrument reflects at a given time and what the interpretation of that pattern should be. Others employ a strictly mechanical or systematic approach to pattern identification and interpretation.\n\nContrasting with technical analysis is ''[[fundamental analysis]]'', the study of [[economic]] factors that influence the way investors price financial markets. Technical analysis holds that prices already reflect all the underlying fundamental factors. Uncovering the trends is what technical indicators are designed to do, although neither technical nor fundamental indicators are perfect. Some traders use technical or fundamental analysis exclusively, while others use both types to make trading decisions.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part II: \"Mass Psychology\"; Chapter 17: \"Managing versus Forecasting\", pp. 65\u201368}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nTechnical analysis employs models and trading rules based on price and volume transformations, such as the [[relative strength index]], [[moving average]]s, [[Regression analysis|regression]]s, inter-market and intra-market price correlations, [[business cycle]]s, [[stock market cycles]] or, classically, through recognition of chart patterns.\n\nTechnical analysis stands in contrast to the [[fundamental analysis]] approach to security and stock analysis. In the fundamental equation M = P/E technical analysis is the examination of M (multiple).  Multiple encompasses the psychology generally abounding, i.e. the extent of willingness to buy/sell.  Also in M is the ability to pay as, for instance, a spent-out [[Market trend#Bull market|bull]] can't make the market go higher and a well-heeled [[Market trend#Bear market|bear]] won't.  Technical analysis analyzes price, volume, psychology, money flow and other market information, whereas fundamental analysis looks at the facts of the company, market, currency or commodity. Most large brokerage, trading group, or financial institutions will typically have both a technical analysis and fundamental analysis team.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s it was widely dismissed by academics.  In a recent review, Irwin and Park<ref name=SurveysReview/> reported that 56 of 95 modern studies found that it produces positive results but noted that many of the positive results were rendered dubious by issues such as [[data snooping]], so that the evidence in support of technical analysis was inconclusive; it is still considered by many academics to be [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Paulos2003>{{cite book | author = Paulos, J.A. | year = 2003 | title = A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market | url = https://archive.org/details/mathematicianpla00paul | url-access = registration | publisher = Basic Books | isbn =  }}</ref> Academics such as [[Eugene Fama]] say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the ''[[Efficient-market hypothesis#Weak-form efficiency|weak form]]'' of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].<ref>Fama, Eugene (May 1970).\n\n[http://www.e-m-h.org/Fama70.pdf  \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work,\"] ''The Journal of Finance'', v. 25 (2), pp. 383-417.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Griffioen, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=566882 Technical Analysis in Financial Markets]''</ref> Users hold that even if technical analysis cannot predict the future, it helps to identify trends, tendencies, and trading opportunities.<ref>[[Jack D.

A technical analyst therefore looks at the history of a security or commodity's trading pattern rather than external drivers such as economic, fundamental and news events. It is believed that price action tends to repeat itself due to the collective, patterned behavior of investors.  Hence technical analysis focuses on identifiable price trends and conditions.<ref>Elder (2008), Chapter 1 - section \"Trend vs Counter-Trending Trading\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ownthedollar.com/2009/12/beware-stock-market-selffulfilling-prophecy/|title=Beware of the Stock Market as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Market action discounts everything===\nBased on the premise that all relevant information is already reflected by prices, technical analysts believe it is important to understand what investors think of that information, known and perceived.\n\n===Prices move in trends===\n{{See also|Market trend}}\nTechnical analysts believe that prices trend directionally, i.e., up, down, or sideways (flat) or some combination. The basic definition of a price trend was originally put forward by [[Dow theory]].<ref name= Murphy/>\n\nAn example of a security that had an apparent trend is AOL from November 2001 through August 2002. A technical analyst or trend follower recognizing this trend would look for opportunities to sell this security. AOL consistently moves downward in price. Each time the stock rose, sellers would enter the market and sell the stock; hence the \"zig-zag\" movement in the price. The series of \"lower highs\" and \"lower lows\" is a tell tale sign of a stock in a down trend.<ref name=Kahn>Kahn, Michael N. (2006). ''Technical Analysis Plain and Simple: Charting the Markets in Your Language'', Financial Times Press, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, p. 80. {{ISBN|0-13-134597-4}}.</ref> In other words, each time the stock moved lower, it fell below its previous relative low price. Each time the stock moved higher, it could not reach the level of its previous relative high price.\n\nNote that the sequence of lower lows and lower highs did not begin until August. Then AOL makes a low price that does not pierce the relative low set earlier in the month. Later in the same month, the stock makes a relative high equal to the most recent relative high. In this a technician sees strong indications that the down trend is at least pausing and possibly ending, and would likely stop actively selling the stock at that point.\n\n===History tends to repeat itself===\nTechnical analysts believe that investors collectively repeat the behavior of the investors that preceded them. To a technician, the emotions in the market may be irrational, but they exist. Because investor behavior repeats itself so often, technicians believe that recognizable (and predictable) price patterns will develop on a chart.<ref name= Murphy/> Recognition of these patterns can allow the technician to select trades that have a higher [[probability]] of success.<ref name=Baiynd2011>{{cite book |author=Baiynd, Anne-Marie |title=The Trading Book: A Complete Solution to Mastering Technical Systems and Trading Psychology |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=9780071766494 |pages=272 |year=2011 |url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |access-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325050543/http://mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |archive-date=2012-03-25 |df= |author-link=Anne-Marie Baiynd }}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysis is not limited to charting, but it always considers price trends.<ref name=\"Kirkpatrick_3\"/> For example, many technicians monitor surveys of investor sentiment. These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether they are [[bearish]] or [[bullish]]. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor sentiment.<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=87}}</ref> Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse; the premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And because most investors ''are'' bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of [[contrarian investing|contrarian trading]].<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=86}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nThe industry is globally represented by the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA), which is a federation of regional and national organizations. In the United States, the industry is represented by both the CMT Association and the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts (AAPTA). The United States is also represented by the Technical Security Analysts Association of San Francisco (TSAASF). In the United Kingdom, the industry is represented by the Society of Technical Analysts (STA). The STA was a founding member of IFTA, has recently celebrated its 50th Anniversary and certifies analysts with the Diploma in Technical Analysis. In Canada the industry is represented by the Canadian Society of Technical Analysts.<ref>''Technical Analysis: The Complete Resource for Financial Market Technicians'', p. 7</ref> In Australia, the industry is represented by the Australian Technical Analysts Association (ATAA),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ataa.com.au|title=Home - Australian Technical Analysts Association|publisher=}}</ref> (which is affiliated to IFTA) and the Australian Professional Technical Analysts (APTA) Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.apta.org.au | title=Home}}</ref>\n\nProfessional technical analysis societies have worked on creating a body of knowledge that describes the field of Technical Analysis. A body of knowledge is central to the field as a way of defining how and why technical analysis may work. It can then be used by academia, as well as regulatory bodies, in developing proper research and standards for the field. The [[CMT Association]] has published a body of knowledge, which is the structure for the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) exam.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMT Association Knowledge Base |url=https://cmtassociation.org/development/knowledge-base/ }}</ref>\n\n===Software===\nTechnical analysis software automates the charting, analysis and reporting functions that support technical analysts in their review and prediction of [[financial market]]s (e.g. the [[stock market]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Systematic trading==\n\n===Neural networks===\nSince the early 1990s when the first practically usable types emerged, [[artificial neural network]]s (ANNs) have rapidly grown in popularity. They are [[artificial intelligence]] adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In mathematical terms, they are universal [[Function approximation|function approximators]],<ref>K. Funahashi, On the approximate realization of continuous mappings by neural networks, Neural Networks vol 2, 1989</ref><ref>K. Hornik, Multilayer feed-forward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, vol 2, 1989</ref> meaning that given the right data and configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to [[fundamental analysis]], as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input.\n\nAs ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.<ref>R.

However, large-scale application is problematic because of the problem of matching the correct neural topology to the market being studied.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Backtesting===\nSystematic trading is most often employed after testing an investment strategy on historic data. This is known as backtesting. Backtesting is most often performed for technical indicators, but can be applied to most investment strategies (e.g. fundamental analysis). While traditional backtesting was done by hand, this was usually only performed on human-selected stocks, and was thus prone to prior knowledge in stock selection. With the advent of computers, backtesting can be performed on entire exchanges over decades of historic data in very short amounts of time.\n\nThe use of computers does have its drawbacks, being limited to algorithms that a computer can perform. Several trading strategies rely on human interpretation,<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|pp=54, 116\u2013118}}</ref> and are unsuitable for computer processing.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993}}</ref> Only technical indicators which are entirely algorithmic can be programmed for computerized automated backtesting.\n\n==Combination with other market forecast methods==\n[[John Murphy (technical analyst)|John Murphy]] states that the principal sources of information available to technicians are price, volume and [[open interest]].<ref name=Murphy/> Other data, such as indicators and [[sentiment analysis]], are considered secondary.\n\nHowever, many technical analysts reach outside pure technical analysis, combining other market forecast methods with their technical work. One advocate for this approach is [[John Bollinger]], who coined the term ''rational analysis'' in the middle 1980s for the intersection of technical analysis and fundamental analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/450723/the_capital_growth_letter.htm|title=The Capital Growth Letter - Research and Markets|first=Research and Markets|last=ltd|publisher=}}</ref> Another such approach, fusion analysis, overlays fundamental analysis with technical, in an attempt to improve portfolio manager performance.\n\nTechnical analysis is also often combined with [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative analysis]] and [[economics]]. For example, neural networks may be used to help identify intermarket relationships.<ref>http://www.iijournals.com/JOT/default.asp?Page=2&ISS=22278&SID=644085</ref>\n\nInvestor and newsletter polls, and magazine cover sentiment indicators, are also used by technical analysts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|title=SFO|publisher=|access-date=2007-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006150127/http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Empirical evidence==\nWhether technical analysis actually works is a matter of controversy.

Thus it holds that technical analysis cannot be effective.

In his book ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton economist [[Burton Malkiel]] said that technical forecasting tools such as pattern analysis must ultimately be self-defeating: \"The problem is that once such a regularity is known to market participants, people will act in such a way that prevents it from happening in the future.\"<ref>Burton Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, W. W. Norton & Company (April 2003) p. 168.</ref>  Malkiel has stated that while momentum may explain some stock price movements, there is not enough momentum to make excess profits. Malkiel has compared technical analysis to \"[[astrology]]\".<ref name=huebscher>Robert Huebscher.

In a 1999 response to Malkiel, Lo and McKinlay collected empirical papers that questioned the hypothesis' applicability<ref>Lo, Andrew; MacKinlay, Craig. ''A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05774-3}}</ref> that suggested a non-random and possibly predictive component to stock price movement, though they were careful to point out that rejecting random walk does not necessarily invalidate EMH, which is an entirely separate concept from RWH. In a 2000 paper, [[Andrew Lo]] back-analyzed data from the U.S. from 1962 to 1996 and found that \"several technical indicators do provide incremental information and may have some practical value\".<ref name=Foundations/>  Burton Malkiel dismissed the irregularities mentioned by Lo and McKinlay as being too small to profit from.<ref name=huebscher/>\n\nTechnicians say{{who|date=March 2011}} that the EMH and random walk theories both ignore the realities of markets, in that participants are not completely rational and that current price moves are not independent of previous moves.<ref name=Kahn/><ref>Poser, Steven W.

The random walk index attempts to determine when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend by measuring price ranges over N and how it differs from what would be expected by a random walk (randomly going up or down).  The greater the range suggests a stronger trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|title=AsiaPacFinance.com Trading Indicator Glossary|publisher=|access-date=2011-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901022339/http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|archive-date=2011-09-01|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nApplying Daniel Kahneman's Prospect Theory<ref>[[Prospect theory]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} to price movements, Paul V.

This commonly observed behaviour of securities prices is sharply at odds with random walk.  By gauging greed and fear in the market<ref>https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/</ref>, investors can better formulate long and short portfolio stances.\n\n==Scientific technical analysis==\n\nCaginalp and Balenovich in 1994<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Gunduz Caginalp & Donald Balenovich |year=2003 |title=A theoretical foundation for technical analysis |journal=Journal of Technical Analysis |volume=59 |pages=5\u201322 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~caginalp/TechAn90.pdf}}</ref> used their asset-flow differential equations model to show that the major patterns of technical analysis could be generated with some basic assumptions. Some of the patterns such as a triangle continuation or reversal pattern can be generated with the assumption of two distinct groups of investors with different assessments of valuation. The major assumptions of the models are that the finiteness of assets and the use of trend as well as valuation in decision making. Many of the patterns follow as mathematically logical consequences of these assumptions.\n\nOne of the problems with conventional technical analysis has been the difficulty of specifying the patterns in a manner that permits objective testing.\n\nJapanese candlestick patterns involve patterns of a few days that are within an uptrend or downtrend. Caginalp and Laurent<ref>G. Caginalp and H. Laurent, \"The Predictive Power of Price Patterns.\" Applied Mathematical Finance, Vol. 5, pp. 181-206, 1998.</ref> were the first to perform a successful large scale test of patterns. A mathematically precise set of criteria were tested by first using a definition of a short-term trend by smoothing the data and allowing for one deviation in the smoothed trend. They then considered eight major three-day candlestick reversal patterns in a non-parametric manner and defined the patterns as a set of inequalities. The results were positive with an overwhelming statistical confidence for each of the patterns using the data set of all S&P 500 stocks daily for the five-year period 1992\u20131996.\n\nAmong the most basic ideas of conventional technical analysis is that a trend, once established, tends to continue.  However, testing for this trend has often led researchers to conclude that stocks are a random walk.  One study, performed by Poterba and Summers,<ref>J.M. Poterba and L.H. Summers, \"Mean reversion in stock prices: Evidence and Implications,\" Journal of Financial Economics 22, 27-59, 1988.</ref> found a small trend effect that was too small to be of trading value.  As Fisher Black\nnoted,<ref>Black, F. 1986. Noise. Journal of Finance 41:529-43.</ref> \"noise\" in trading price data makes it difficult to test hypotheses.\n\nOne method for avoiding this noise was discovered in 1995 by Caginalp and Constantine<ref>G. Caginalp and G. Constantine, \"Statistical inference and modeling of momentum in stock prices,\" Applied Mathematical Finance 2, 225-242, 1995.</ref> who used a ratio of two essentially identical closed-end funds to eliminate any changes in valuation. A closed-end fund (unlike an open-end fund) trades independently of its net asset value and its shares cannot be redeemed, but only traded among investors as any other stock on the exchanges. In this study, the authors found that the best estimate of tomorrow's price is not yesterday's price (as the efficient-market hypothesis would indicate), nor is it the pure momentum price (namely, the same relative price change from yesterday to today continues from today to tomorrow). But rather it is almost exactly halfway between the two.\n\nStarting from the characterization of the past time evolution of market prices in terms of price velocity and price acceleration, an attempt towards a general framework for technical analysis has been developed, with the goal of establishing a principled classification of the possible patterns characterizing the deviation or defects from the random walk market state and its time translational invariant properties.<ref>J. V. Andersen, S. Gluzman and D. Sornette, Fundamental Framework for Technical Analysis, European Physical Journal B 14, 579-601 (2000)</ref> The classification relies on two dimensionless parameters, the [[Froude number]] characterizing the relative strength of the acceleration with respect to the velocity and the time horizon forecast dimensionalized to the training period. Trend-following and contrarian patterns are found to coexist and depend on the dimensionless time horizon. Using a [[renormalisation group]] approach, the probabilistic based scenario approach exhibits statistically signifificant predictive power in essentially all tested market phases.\n\nA survey of modern studies by Park and Irwin<ref>C-H Park and S.H. Irwin, \"The Profitability of Technical Analysis: A Review\" AgMAS Project Research Report No. 2004-04</ref> showed that most found a positive result from technical analysis.\n\nIn 2011, Caginalp and DeSantis<ref>G. Caginalp and M. DeSantis, \"Nonlinearity in the dynamics of financial markets,\" Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 12(2), 1140-1151, 2011.</ref> have used large data sets of closed-end funds, where comparison with valuation is possible, in order to determine quantitatively whether key aspects of technical analysis such as trend and resistance have scientific validity. Using data sets of over 100,000 points they demonstrate that trend has an effect that is at least half as important as valuation. The effects of volume and volatility, which are smaller, are also evident and statistically significant. An important aspect of their work involves the nonlinear effect of trend. Positive trends that occur within approximately 3.7 standard deviations have a positive effect. For stronger uptrends, there is a negative effect on returns, suggesting that profit taking occurs as the magnitude of the uptrend increases. For downtrends the situation is similar except that the \"buying on dips\" does not take place until the downtrend is a 4.6 standard deviation event. These methods can be used to examine investor behavior and compare the underlying strategies among different asset classes.\n\nIn 2013, Kim Man Lui and T Chong pointed out that the past findings on technical analysis mostly reported the profitability of specific trading rules for a given set of historical data. These past studies had not taken the human trader into consideration as no real-world trader would mechanically adopt signals from any technical analysis method. Therefore, to unveil the truth of technical analysis, we should get back to understand the performance between experienced and novice traders. If the market really walks randomly, there will be no difference between these two kinds of traders. However, it is found by experiment that traders who are more knowledgeable on technical analysis significantly outperform those who are less knowledgeable.<ref>K.M. Lui and T.T.L Chong, \"Do Technical Analysts Outperform Novice Traders: Experimental Evidence\" Economics Bulletin. 33(4), 3080-3087, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Ticker-tape reading==\n\n{{Main|Ticker tape}}\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, '''tape reading''' was a popular form of technical analysis. It consisted of reading market information such as price, volume, order size, and so on from a paper strip which ran through a machine called a [[stock ticker]]. Market data was sent to brokerage houses and to the homes and offices of the most active speculators. This system fell into disuse with the advent of electronic information panels in the late 60's, and later computers, which allow for the easy preparation of charts.\n\n[[Jesse Livermore]], one of the most successful stock market operators of all time, was primarily concerned with ticker tape reading since a young age. He followed his own (mechanical) trading system (he called it the 'market key'), which did not need charts, but was relying solely on price data. He described his market key in detail in his 1940s book 'How to Trade in Stocks'.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940}}</ref> Livermore's system was determining market phases (trend, correction etc.) via past price data. He also made use of volume data (which he estimated from how stocks behaved and via 'market testing', a process of testing market liquidity via sending in small market orders), as described in his 1940s book.\n\n== Quotation board ==\n\nAnother form of technical analysis used so far was via interpretation of [[Stock market data systems|stock market data]] contained in quotation boards, that in the times before [[electronic visual display|electronic screens]], were huge [[blackboard|chalkboards]] located in the stock exchanges, with data of the main financial assets listed on exchanges for analysis of their movements.<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|pp=1, 18}}</ref> It was manually updated with chalk, with the updates regarding some of these data being transmitted to environments outside of exchanges (such as [[Brokerage firm|brokerage houses]], [[Bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shops]], etc.) via the aforementioned tape, [[telegraphy|telegraph]], [[telephone]] and later [[telex]].<ref>{{harvp|Lef\u00e8vre|2000|p=17}}</ref>\n\nThis analysis tool was used both, on the spot, mainly by market professionals for [[day trading]] and [[Scalping (trading)|scalping]], as well as by general public through the printed versions in newspapers showing the data of the negotiations of the previous day, for [[Swing trading|swing]] and [[Trend following|position trades]].<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940|pp=17-18}}</ref>\n\n==Charting terms and indicators==\n\n===Concepts===\n* [[Average true range]]{{spaced ndash}}averaged daily trading range, adjusted for price gaps.\n* [[Breakout (technical analysis)|Breakout]]{{spaced ndash}}the concept whereby prices forcefully penetrate an area of prior [[Support (technical analysis)|support]] or [[Resistance (technical analysis)|resistance]], usually, but not always, accompanied by an increase in volume.\n* [[Chart pattern]]{{spaced ndash}}distinctive pattern created by the movement of security or commodity prices on a chart\n* [[Stock market cycles|Cycles]]{{spaced ndash}}time targets for potential change in price action (price only moves up, down, or sideways)\n* [[Dead cat bounce]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon whereby a spectacular decline in the price of a stock is immediately followed by a moderate and temporary rise before resuming its downward movement\n* [[Elliott wave principle]] and the [[golden ratio]] to calculate successive price movements and retracements\n* [[Fibonacci ratio]]s{{spaced ndash}}used as a guide to determine support and resistance\n* [[Momentum (technical analysis)|Momentum]]{{spaced ndash}}the rate of price change\n* [[Point and figure chart|Point and figure analysis]]{{spaced ndash}}A priced-based analytical approach employing numerical filters which may incorporate time references, though ignores time entirely in its construction\n* [[Resistance (technical analysis)|Resistance]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of selling activity\n* [[Support (technical analysis)|Support]]{{spaced ndash}}a price level that may prompt a net increase of buying activity\n* [[Market trend|Trending]]{{spaced ndash}}the phenomenon by which price movement tends to persist in one direction for an extended period of time\n\n===Types of charts===\n* [[Candlestick chart]]{{spaced ndash}}Of Japanese origin and similar to OHLC, candlesticks widen and fill the interval between the open and close prices to emphasize the open/close relationship.

Schabacker published several books which continued the work of [[Charles Dow]] and [[William Peter Hamilton]] in their books ''Stock Market Theory and Practice'' and ''Technical Market Analysis''.  In 1948, Robert D. Edwards and John Magee published ''Technical Analysis of Stock Trends'' which is widely considered to be one of the seminal works of the discipline.  It is exclusively concerned with trend analysis and chart patterns and remains in use to the present. Early technical analysis was almost exclusively the analysis of charts because the processing power of computers was not available for the modern degree of statistical analysis. Charles Dow reportedly originated a form of [[point and figure chart]] analysis.  With the emergence of behavioural finance as a separate discipline in economics, Paul V. Azzopardi combined technical analysis with behavioural finance and coined the term \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\".<ref> Paul V. Azzopardi, \"Behavioural Technical Analysis\", ibid</ref>\n\n[[Dow theory]] is based on the collected writings of [[Dow Jones and Company|Dow Jones]] co-founder and editor Charles Dow, and inspired the use and development of modern technical analysis at the end of the 19th century. Other pioneers of analysis techniques include [[Ralph Nelson Elliott]], [[William Delbert Gann]] and [[Richard Wyckoff]] who developed their respective techniques in the early 20th century. More technical tools and theories have been developed and enhanced in recent decades, with an increasing emphasis on computer-assisted techniques using specially designed computer software.\n\n==General description==\nFundamental analysts examine earnings, dividends, assets, quality, ratio, new products, research and the like. Technicians employ many methods, tools and techniques as well, one of which is the use of charts.  Using charts, technical analysts seek to identify price patterns and [[market trend]]s in financial markets and attempt to exploit those patterns.<ref name=Murphy>Murphy, John J. ''Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets''.  New York Institute of Finance, 1999, pp. 1-5, 24-31. {{ISBN|0-7352-0066-1}}</ref>\n\nTechnicians using charts search for archetypal price chart patterns, such as the well-known [[Head and shoulders (chart pattern)|head and shoulders]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://primepair.com/trading-education/forex-analysis/technical-analysis#Head_and_Shoulders |title=PrimePair.com Head and Shoulders Pattern |access-date=2015-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106114558/http://primepair.com/trading-education/forex-analysis/technical-analysis#Head_and_Shoulders#Head_and_Shoulders |archive-date=2015-01-06 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> or [[double top and double bottom|double top/bottom]] reversal patterns, study [[technical indicator]]s, [[moving average]]s, and look for forms such as lines of support, resistance, channels, and more obscure formations such as [[Flag and pennant patterns#The Flag Pattern|flags]], [[Flag and pennant patterns#Pennant pattern|pennants]], balance days and [[cup and handle]] patterns.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part III: Classical Chart Analysis}}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysts also widely use market indicators of many sorts, some of which are mathematical transformations of price, often including up and down volume, advance/decline data and other inputs. These indicators are used to help assess whether an asset is trending, and if it is, the probability of its direction and of continuation. Technicians also look for relationships between price/volume indices and market indicators.  Examples include the [[moving average]], [[relative strength index]], and [[MACD]]. Other avenues of study include correlations between changes in Options ([[implied volatility]]) and put/call ratios with price. Also important are sentiment indicators such as Put/Call ratios, bull/bear ratios, short interest, Implied Volatility, etc.\n\nThere are many techniques in technical analysis. Adherents of different techniques (for example: Candlestick analysis, the oldest form of technical analysis developed by a Japanese grain trader; [[Harmonics]]; [[Dow theory]]; and [[Elliott wave theory]]) may ignore the other approaches, yet many traders combine elements from more than one technique. Some technical analysts use subjective judgment to decide which pattern(s) a particular instrument reflects at a given time and what the interpretation of that pattern should be. Others employ a strictly mechanical or systematic approach to pattern identification and interpretation.\n\nContrasting with technical analysis is ''[[fundamental analysis]]'', the study of [[economic]] factors that influence the way investors price financial markets. Technical analysis holds that prices already reflect all the underlying fundamental factors. Uncovering the trends is what technical indicators are designed to do, although neither technical nor fundamental indicators are perfect. Some traders use technical or fundamental analysis exclusively, while others use both types to make trading decisions.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|loc=Part II: \"Mass Psychology\"; Chapter 17: \"Managing versus Forecasting\", pp. 65\u201368}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nTechnical analysis employs models and trading rules based on price and volume transformations, such as the [[relative strength index]], [[moving average]]s, [[Regression analysis|regression]]s, inter-market and intra-market price correlations, [[business cycle]]s, [[stock market cycles]] or, classically, through recognition of chart patterns.\n\nTechnical analysis stands in contrast to the [[fundamental analysis]] approach to security and stock analysis. In the fundamental equation M = P/E technical analysis is the examination of M (multiple).  Multiple encompasses the psychology generally abounding, i.e. the extent of willingness to buy/sell.  Also in M is the ability to pay as, for instance, a spent-out [[Market trend#Bull market|bull]] can't make the market go higher and a well-heeled [[Market trend#Bear market|bear]] won't.  Technical analysis analyzes price, volume, psychology, money flow and other market information, whereas fundamental analysis looks at the facts of the company, market, currency or commodity. Most large brokerage, trading group, or financial institutions will typically have both a technical analysis and fundamental analysis team.\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s it was widely dismissed by academics.  In a recent review, Irwin and Park<ref name=SurveysReview/> reported that 56 of 95 modern studies found that it produces positive results but noted that many of the positive results were rendered dubious by issues such as [[data snooping]], so that the evidence in support of technical analysis was inconclusive; it is still considered by many academics to be [[pseudoscience]].<ref name=Paulos2003>{{cite book | author = Paulos, J.A. | year = 2003 | title = A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market | url = https://archive.org/details/mathematicianpla00paul | url-access = registration | publisher = Basic Books | isbn =  }}</ref> Academics such as [[Eugene Fama]] say the evidence for technical analysis is sparse and is inconsistent with the ''[[Efficient-market hypothesis#Weak-form efficiency|weak form]]'' of the [[efficient-market hypothesis]].<ref>Fama, Eugene (May 1970).\n\n[http://www.e-m-h.org/Fama70.pdf  \"Efficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work,\"] ''The Journal of Finance'', v. 25 (2), pp. 383-417.</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Griffioen, ''[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=566882 Technical Analysis in Financial Markets]''</ref> Users hold that even if technical analysis cannot predict the future, it helps to identify trends, tendencies, and trading opportunities.<ref>[[Jack D.

A technical analyst therefore looks at the history of a security or commodity's trading pattern rather than external drivers such as economic, fundamental and news events. It is believed that price action tends to repeat itself due to the collective, patterned behavior of investors.  Hence technical analysis focuses on identifiable price trends and conditions.<ref>Elder (2008), Chapter 1 - section \"Trend vs Counter-Trending Trading\"</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ownthedollar.com/2009/12/beware-stock-market-selffulfilling-prophecy/|title=Beware of the Stock Market as a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Market action discounts everything===\nBased on the premise that all relevant information is already reflected by prices, technical analysts believe it is important to understand what investors think of that information, known and perceived.\n\n===Prices move in trends===\n{{See also|Market trend}}\nTechnical analysts believe that prices trend directionally, i.e., up, down, or sideways (flat) or some combination. The basic definition of a price trend was originally put forward by [[Dow theory]].<ref name= Murphy/>\n\nAn example of a security that had an apparent trend is AOL from November 2001 through August 2002. A technical analyst or trend follower recognizing this trend would look for opportunities to sell this security. AOL consistently moves downward in price. Each time the stock rose, sellers would enter the market and sell the stock; hence the \"zig-zag\" movement in the price. The series of \"lower highs\" and \"lower lows\" is a tell tale sign of a stock in a down trend.<ref name=Kahn>Kahn, Michael N. (2006). ''Technical Analysis Plain and Simple: Charting the Markets in Your Language'', Financial Times Press, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, p. 80. {{ISBN|0-13-134597-4}}.</ref> In other words, each time the stock moved lower, it fell below its previous relative low price. Each time the stock moved higher, it could not reach the level of its previous relative high price.\n\nNote that the sequence of lower lows and lower highs did not begin until August. Then AOL makes a low price that does not pierce the relative low set earlier in the month. Later in the same month, the stock makes a relative high equal to the most recent relative high. In this a technician sees strong indications that the down trend is at least pausing and possibly ending, and would likely stop actively selling the stock at that point.\n\n===History tends to repeat itself===\nTechnical analysts believe that investors collectively repeat the behavior of the investors that preceded them. To a technician, the emotions in the market may be irrational, but they exist. Because investor behavior repeats itself so often, technicians believe that recognizable (and predictable) price patterns will develop on a chart.<ref name= Murphy/> Recognition of these patterns can allow the technician to select trades that have a higher [[probability]] of success.<ref name=Baiynd2011>{{cite book |author=Baiynd, Anne-Marie |title=The Trading Book: A Complete Solution to Mastering Technical Systems and Trading Psychology |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=9780071766494 |pages=272 |year=2011 |url=http://www.mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |access-date=2013-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325050543/http://mcgraw-hill.com.au/html/9780071766494.html |archive-date=2012-03-25 |df= |author-link=Anne-Marie Baiynd }}</ref>\n\nTechnical analysis is not limited to charting, but it always considers price trends.<ref name=\"Kirkpatrick_3\"/> For example, many technicians monitor surveys of investor sentiment. These surveys gauge the attitude of market participants, specifically whether they are [[bearish]] or [[bullish]]. Technicians use these surveys to help determine whether a trend will continue or if a reversal could develop; they are most likely to anticipate a change when the surveys report extreme investor sentiment.<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=87}}</ref> Surveys that show overwhelming bullishness, for example, are evidence that an uptrend may reverse; the premise being that if most investors are bullish they have already bought the market (anticipating higher prices). And because most investors ''are'' bullish and invested, one assumes that few buyers remain. This leaves more potential sellers than buyers, despite the bullish sentiment. This suggests that prices will trend down, and is an example of [[contrarian investing|contrarian trading]].<ref>{{harvp|Kirkpatrick|Dahlquist|2006|p=86}}</ref>\n\n==Industry==\nThe industry is globally represented by the International Federation of Technical Analysts (IFTA), which is a federation of regional and national organizations.

The United States is also represented by the Technical Security Analysts Association of San Francisco (TSAASF). In the United Kingdom, the industry is represented by the Society of Technical Analysts (STA). The STA was a founding member of IFTA, has recently celebrated its 50th Anniversary and certifies analysts with the Diploma in Technical Analysis.

A body of knowledge is central to the field as a way of defining how and why technical analysis may work. It can then be used by academia, as well as regulatory bodies, in developing proper research and standards for the field. The [[CMT Association]] has published a body of knowledge, which is the structure for the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) exam.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMT Association Knowledge Base |url=https://cmtassociation.org/development/knowledge-base/ }}</ref>\n\n===Software===\nTechnical analysis software automates the charting, analysis and reporting functions that support technical analysts in their review and prediction of [[financial market]]s (e.g. the [[stock market]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Systematic trading==\n\n===Neural networks===\nSince the early 1990s when the first practically usable types emerged, [[artificial neural network]]s (ANNs) have rapidly grown in popularity. They are [[artificial intelligence]] adaptive software systems that have been inspired by how biological neural networks work. They are used because they can learn to detect complex patterns in data. In mathematical terms, they are universal [[Function approximation|function approximators]],<ref>K. Funahashi, On the approximate realization of continuous mappings by neural networks, Neural Networks vol 2, 1989</ref><ref>K. Hornik, Multilayer feed-forward networks are universal approximators, Neural Networks, vol 2, 1989</ref> meaning that given the right data and configured correctly, they can capture and model any input-output relationships. This not only removes the need for human interpretation of charts or the series of rules for generating entry/exit signals, but also provides a bridge to [[fundamental analysis]], as the variables used in fundamental analysis can be used as input.\n\nAs ANNs are essentially non-linear statistical models, their accuracy and prediction capabilities can be both mathematically and empirically tested. In various studies, authors have claimed that neural networks used for generating trading signals given various technical and fundamental inputs have significantly outperformed buy-hold strategies as well as traditional linear technical analysis methods when combined with rule-based expert systems.<ref>R.

However, large-scale application is problematic because of the problem of matching the correct neural topology to the market being studied.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Backtesting===\nSystematic trading is most often employed after testing an investment strategy on historic data. This is known as backtesting. Backtesting is most often performed for technical indicators, but can be applied to most investment strategies (e.g. fundamental analysis). While traditional backtesting was done by hand, this was usually only performed on human-selected stocks, and was thus prone to prior knowledge in stock selection. With the advent of computers, backtesting can be performed on entire exchanges over decades of historic data in very short amounts of time.\n\nThe use of computers does have its drawbacks, being limited to algorithms that a computer can perform. Several trading strategies rely on human interpretation,<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993|pp=54, 116\u2013118}}</ref> and are unsuitable for computer processing.<ref>{{harvp|Elder|1993}}</ref> Only technical indicators which are entirely algorithmic can be programmed for computerized automated backtesting.\n\n==Combination with other market forecast methods==\n[[John Murphy (technical analyst)|John Murphy]] states that the principal sources of information available to technicians are price, volume and [[open interest]].<ref name=Murphy/> Other data, such as indicators and [[sentiment analysis]], are considered secondary.\n\nHowever, many technical analysts reach outside pure technical analysis, combining other market forecast methods with their technical work. One advocate for this approach is [[John Bollinger]], who coined the term ''rational analysis'' in the middle 1980s for the intersection of technical analysis and fundamental analysis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/450723/the_capital_growth_letter.htm|title=The Capital Growth Letter - Research and Markets|first=Research and Markets|last=ltd|publisher=}}</ref> Another such approach, fusion analysis, overlays fundamental analysis with technical, in an attempt to improve portfolio manager performance.\n\nTechnical analysis is also often combined with [[Quantitative analyst|quantitative analysis]] and [[economics]]. For example, neural networks may be used to help identify intermarket relationships.<ref>http://www.iijournals.com/JOT/default.asp?Page=2&ISS=22278&SID=644085</ref>\n\nInvestor and newsletter polls, and magazine cover sentiment indicators, are also used by technical analysts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|title=SFO|publisher=|access-date=2007-08-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006150127/http://www.sfomag.com/departmentprintdetail.asp?ID=1776333475|archive-date=2007-10-06|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Empirical evidence==\nWhether technical analysis actually works is a matter of controversy.

In his book ''A Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton economist [[Burton Malkiel]] said that technical forecasting tools such as pattern analysis must ultimately be self-defeating: \"The problem is that once such a regularity is known to market participants, people will act in such a way that prevents it from happening in the future.\"<ref>Burton Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, W. W. Norton & Company (April 2003) p. 168.</ref>  Malkiel has stated that while momentum may explain some stock price movements, there is not enough momentum to make excess profits.

In a 1999 response to Malkiel, Lo and McKinlay collected empirical papers that questioned the hypothesis' applicability<ref>Lo, Andrew; MacKinlay, Craig. ''A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{ISBN|978-0-691-05774-3}}</ref> that suggested a non-random and possibly predictive component to stock price movement, though they were careful to point out that rejecting random walk does not necessarily invalidate EMH, which is an entirely separate concept from RWH.

The random walk index attempts to determine when the market is in a strong uptrend or downtrend by measuring price ranges over N and how it differs from what would be expected by a random walk (randomly going up or down).  The greater the range suggests a stronger trend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|title=AsiaPacFinance.com Trading Indicator Glossary|publisher=|access-date=2011-08-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901022339/http://www.asiapacfinance.com/trading-strategies/technicalindicators/RandomWalkIndex|archive-date=2011-09-01|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\nApplying Daniel Kahneman's Prospect Theory<ref>[[Prospect theory]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2020}} to price movements, Paul V.

This commonly observed behaviour of securities prices is sharply at odds with random walk.  By gauging greed and fear in the market<ref>https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/</ref>, investors can better formulate long and short portfolio stances.\n\n==Scientific technical analysis==\n\nCaginalp and Balenovich in 1994<ref>{{cite journal |authors=Gunduz Caginalp & Donald Balenovich |year=2003 |title=A theoretical foundation for technical analysis |journal=Journal of Technical Analysis |volume=59 |pages=5\u201322 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~caginalp/TechAn90.pdf}}</ref> used their asset-flow differential equations model to show that the major patterns of technical analysis could be generated with some basic assumptions. Some of the patterns such as a triangle continuation or reversal pattern can be generated with the assumption of two distinct groups of investors with different assessments of valuation. The major assumptions of the models are that the finiteness of assets and the use of trend as well as valuation in decision making. Many of the patterns follow as mathematically logical consequences of these assumptions.\n\nOne of the problems with conventional technical analysis has been the difficulty of specifying the patterns in a manner that permits objective testing.\n\nJapanese candlestick patterns involve patterns of a few days that are within an uptrend or downtrend. Caginalp and Laurent<ref>G. Caginalp and H. Laurent, \"The Predictive Power of Price Patterns.\" Applied Mathematical Finance, Vol. 5, pp. 181-206, 1998.</ref> were the first to perform a successful large scale test of patterns. A mathematically precise set of criteria were tested by first using a definition of a short-term trend by smoothing the data and allowing for one deviation in the smoothed trend. They then considered eight major three-day candlestick reversal patterns in a non-parametric manner and defined the patterns as a set of inequalities. The results were positive with an overwhelming statistical confidence for each of the patterns using the data set of all S&P 500 stocks daily for the five-year period 1992\u20131996.\n\nAmong the most basic ideas of conventional technical analysis is that a trend, once established, tends to continue.  However, testing for this trend has often led researchers to conclude that stocks are a random walk.  One study, performed by Poterba and Summers,<ref>J.M. Poterba and L.H. Summers, \"Mean reversion in stock prices: Evidence and Implications,\" Journal of Financial Economics 22, 27-59, 1988.</ref> found a small trend effect that was too small to be of trading value.  As Fisher Black\nnoted,<ref>Black, F. 1986. Noise. Journal of Finance 41:529-43.</ref> \"noise\" in trading price data makes it difficult to test hypotheses.\n\nOne method for avoiding this noise was discovered in 1995 by Caginalp and Constantine<ref>G. Caginalp and G. Constantine, \"Statistical inference and modeling of momentum in stock prices,\" Applied Mathematical Finance 2, 225-242, 1995.</ref> who used a ratio of two essentially identical closed-end funds to eliminate any changes in valuation. A closed-end fund (unlike an open-end fund) trades independently of its net asset value and its shares cannot be redeemed, but only traded among investors as any other stock on the exchanges. In this study, the authors found that the best estimate of tomorrow's price is not yesterday's price (as the efficient-market hypothesis would indicate), nor is it the pure momentum price (namely, the same relative price change from yesterday to today continues from today to tomorrow). But rather it is almost exactly halfway between the two.\n\nStarting from the characterization of the past time evolution of market prices in terms of price velocity and price acceleration, an attempt towards a general framework for technical analysis has been developed, with the goal of establishing a principled classification of the possible patterns characterizing the deviation or defects from the random walk market state and its time translational invariant properties.<ref>J. V. Andersen, S. Gluzman and D. Sornette, Fundamental Framework for Technical Analysis, European Physical Journal B 14, 579-601 (2000)</ref> The classification relies on two dimensionless parameters, the [[Froude number]] characterizing the relative strength of the acceleration with respect to the velocity and the time horizon forecast dimensionalized to the training period. Trend-following and contrarian patterns are found to coexist and depend on the dimensionless time horizon. Using a [[renormalisation group]] approach, the probabilistic based scenario approach exhibits statistically signifificant predictive power in essentially all tested market phases.\n\nA survey of modern studies by Park and Irwin<ref>C-H Park and S.H. Irwin, \"The Profitability of Technical Analysis: A Review\" AgMAS Project Research Report No. 2004-04</ref> showed that most found a positive result from technical analysis.\n\nIn 2011, Caginalp and DeSantis<ref>G. Caginalp and M. DeSantis, \"Nonlinearity in the dynamics of financial markets,\" Nonlinear Analysis: Real World Applications, 12(2), 1140-1151, 2011.</ref> have used large data sets of closed-end funds, where comparison with valuation is possible, in order to determine quantitatively whether key aspects of technical analysis such as trend and resistance have scientific validity. Using data sets of over 100,000 points they demonstrate that trend has an effect that is at least half as important as valuation. The effects of volume and volatility, which are smaller, are also evident and statistically significant. An important aspect of their work involves the nonlinear effect of trend. Positive trends that occur within approximately 3.7 standard deviations have a positive effect. For stronger uptrends, there is a negative effect on returns, suggesting that profit taking occurs as the magnitude of the uptrend increases. For downtrends the situation is similar except that the \"buying on dips\" does not take place until the downtrend is a 4.6 standard deviation event. These methods can be used to examine investor behavior and compare the underlying strategies among different asset classes.\n\nIn 2013, Kim Man Lui and T Chong pointed out that the past findings on technical analysis mostly reported the profitability of specific trading rules for a given set of historical data. These past studies had not taken the human trader into consideration as no real-world trader would mechanically adopt signals from any technical analysis method. Therefore, to unveil the truth of technical analysis, we should get back to understand the performance between experienced and novice traders. If the market really walks randomly, there will be no difference between these two kinds of traders. However, it is found by experiment that traders who are more knowledgeable on technical analysis significantly outperform those who are less knowledgeable.<ref>K.M. Lui and T.T.L Chong, \"Do Technical Analysts Outperform Novice Traders: Experimental Evidence\" Economics Bulletin. 33(4), 3080-3087, 2013.</ref>\n\n==Ticker-tape reading==\n\n{{Main|Ticker tape}}\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, '''tape reading''' was a popular form of technical analysis. It consisted of reading market information such as price, volume, order size, and so on from a paper strip which ran through a machine called a [[stock ticker]]. Market data was sent to brokerage houses and to the homes and offices of the most active speculators. This system fell into disuse with the advent of electronic information panels in the late 60's, and later computers, which allow for the easy preparation of charts.\n\n[[Jesse Livermore]], one of the most successful stock market operators of all time, was primarily concerned with ticker tape reading since a young age. He followed his own (mechanical) trading system (he called it the 'market key'), which did not need charts, but was relying solely on price data. He described his market key in detail in his 1940s book 'How to Trade in Stocks'.<ref>{{harvp|Livermore|1940}}</ref> Livermore's system was determining market phases (trend, correction etc.) via past price data.

The family home was in Essex St, Timaru and the children attended Marchwiel Primary School.<ref name=\"NZH_taste\" /> His parents divorced during the 1970s. A family friend has reported that Wilson's father used to beat his wife and the children. Wilson missed a lot of school and would sometimes come to school with bruises.<ref name=\"NZH_taste\"/> In 1996, Wilson's mother told a newspaper reporter her son suffered brain damage in his early teens which, she claimed, 'caused him to lose control occasionally'. Wilson was directed to live in a children's home. \n\nWilson also spent time at [[Hawksbury, New Zealand|Cherry Farm Psychiatric Hospital]] during his youth. In a letter to the judge prior to sentencing in 2018, Wilson wrote that he had no memory of the events with which he was charged nearly 50 years ago which he put down to \"the shock treatment I received while a patient at Cherry farm Hospital, Sunnyside Hospital, Porirua Hospital, Tokanui Hospital, Carrington and Oakley hospital while I was under child welfare for seven years until I was 21 years old... While in those hospitals and welfare homes, I was abused, raped and bullied many many times. I witnessed the murder of a male nurse who I tried to protect and who died in my arms and that person also tried to kill me as I was a witness.\" Wilson also mentioned that he had been receiving counselling from ACC because of his childhood abuse but his probation officer cancelled it.<ref>[https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/377062/beast-of-blenheim-stewart-murray-wilson-jailed-for-more-historical-rape-charges-but-will-lodge-an-appeal 'Beast of Blenheim' Stewart Murray Wilson jailed for more historical rape charges - but will lodge an appeal], RNZ, 29 November 2018 </ref>\n\nWilson's criminal record began in 1962<ref name=DOCvWilson/> when he appeared in court on burglary charges.

A score of .7 (or above) indicates a 70% risk and is classified as high risk.</ref>\n\n== Parole Board hearings ==\n\nPrior to his impending release in September 2012, Wilson appeared before the Parole Board at least five times. Each application for early release was turned down.<ref name=\"cries-to-judge\" /> At the age of 65, after 18 years in prison, he was released two days before his statutory release date of 1 September 2012.<ref name=DOCvWilson/>\n\nIn the process of establishing his release conditions, the parole board was told by clinical psychologist, Jane Freeman-Brown, that Wilson was still at high risk of reoffending.

The first of those conditions requires Wilson to live in a state house which was to be shifted onto the grounds of Wanganui Prison especially for him. Another condition was for him to wear a [[GPS tracking unit|GPS tracking]] device \u2013 one of the first prisoners ever to be fitted with one. Wilson must seek permission from his probation officer before inviting females to his house, and cannot have contact with anyone under 16 without supervision. The conditions also prohibit him from attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and church groups and he is not allowed to use the internet.<ref name=go_somewhere>\"[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10827850 The beast must go somewhere]\". ''Herald on Sunday''. 19 August 2012.</ref>\n\nThree months after his release Wilson continued to live rent free in a house on prison land.

His youngest brother was killed in a car crash aged 14. The family home was in Essex St, Timaru and the children attended Marchwiel Primary School.<ref name=\"NZH_taste\" /> His parents divorced during the 1970s. A family friend has reported that Wilson's father used to beat his wife and the children. Wilson missed a lot of school and would sometimes come to school with bruises.<ref name=\"NZH_taste\"/> In 1996, Wilson's mother told a newspaper reporter her son suffered brain damage in his early teens which, she claimed, 'caused him to lose control occasionally'. Wilson was directed to live in a children's home. \n\nWilson also spent time at [[Hawksbury, New Zealand|Cherry Farm Psychiatric Hospital]] during his youth. In a letter to the judge prior to sentencing in 2018, Wilson wrote that he had no memory of the events with which he was charged nearly 50 years ago which he put down to \"the shock treatment I received while a patient at Cherry farm Hospital, Sunnyside Hospital, Porirua Hospital, Tokanui Hospital, Carrington and Oakley hospital while I was under child welfare for seven years until I was 21 years old... While in those hospitals and welfare homes, I was abused, raped and bullied many many times. I witnessed the murder of a male nurse who I tried to protect and who died in my arms and that person also tried to kill me as I was a witness.\" Wilson also mentioned that he had been receiving counselling from ACC because of his childhood abuse but his probation officer cancelled it.<ref>[https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/377062/beast-of-blenheim-stewart-murray-wilson-jailed-for-more-historical-rape-charges-but-will-lodge-an-appeal 'Beast of Blenheim' Stewart Murray Wilson jailed for more historical rape charges - but will lodge an appeal], RNZ, 29 November 2018 </ref>\n\nWilson's criminal record began in 1962<ref name=DOCvWilson/> when he appeared in court on burglary charges.

It was founded by French missionary P\u00e9re Jules Leman [[CSSp]] in 1860 as a school and civil service training centre.\n\nThe college, {{convert|7|km|miles}} from Dublin city centre, is just in from the sea, and is self-contained, with large boarding and teaching facilities in 56 acres of rolling parkland. It accommodates approximately 1,000 day and boarding students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/files/admin/uploads/W47_F_1279_6639.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119060046/http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/files/admin/uploads/W47_F_1279_6639.doc |archivedate=19 November 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nNow run by a lay foundation in trust, it maintains academic standards and requires all pupils to participate in non-academic activities, and it has a strong sporting tradition. The missionary tradition continues with charity programmes, especially at Christmas.\n\n==History==\nThe college was founded by the [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Congregation of the Holy Ghost]] in 1860, the first of the Order's five schools in Ireland. The founder is listed as Fr (P\u00e8re) Jules Leman, a French missionary with the Holy Ghost Order. Leman had a dual aim, namely to train personnel for missionary service in the Third World and provide a first class Catholic education for Irish boys. It was originally known as the ''French College'' by the locals. A successful [[civil service]] training and university department (where students were examined and had degrees conferred by the [[Royal University of Ireland]]) were run for over forty years, until [[University College Dublin]] grew, and the school focused more on the second level curriculum.\n\nAlthough never a seminary, some ordinations have taken place in Blackrock. The first ordination at Blackrock College was on 22 April 1900 when Mgr. Emile Allgeyer CSSp (a former student in Blackrock and first to be made a bishop), ordained [[Joseph (Ignatius) Shanahan|Joseph Shanahan]] who later became a bishop, and has a House named after him within the school.<ref>[http://www.spiritan.org/shanahan_profile.html Bishop Joseph Shanahan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010217113518/http://www.spiritan.org/shanahan_profile.html |date=17 February 2001 }} www.spiritan.org.</ref> From 1924 until 1933 the Holy Ghost Fathers studied Theology at Blackrock Castle, before returning to Kimmage Manor.\n\nIn June 1932, college President [[John Charles McQuaid]], hosted a large garden party on the grounds of the college to welcome the papal legate, [[Lorenzo Lauri]], where the many hundreds of bishops assembled for the [[Eucharistic Congress of Dublin (1932)]] had the opportunity to mingle with a huge gathering of distinguished guests, including President of the Executive Council, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], and others who had paid a modest subscription fee.<ref>The Church in Dublin: 1940-1965, by Roland Burke Savage, Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, Winter 1965</ref>\n\n===Heraldry===\nThe crest of the college is the third creation, dating back to 1936 and explained in the 1937 College Annual as being: <blockquote>The Heraldic Crest Of The College. ARGENT: - On a Cross Azure, the Dove of the Holy Ghost, Proper, with seven Rays descendant, Or. In the first quarter a Lion rampant of the second.</blockquote>\n\nOn 30 April 1926, Fr. Leen at a sports day speech encapsulated the words ''Fides Et Robur'' which henceforth became the Rock motto. In 1928, a new College Crest, bearing four emblems around a blue cross was hurriedly officiated, primarily to show off the Fides Et Robur motto over the College's especially built new front gates. Not everyone was happy with this design and possible variations of a new design may have been experimented with; evidence exists that both in crest and in uniform, by reason of fault or debate, and most likely between 1928 and 1936, a distinctive crest had been \"with nine rays descendant, Or\". In 1936, Dr. McQuaid instigated a new and distinctive crest that to this day is in continual use (unchecked variations and wayward deviations are contracted into stores by stationery and uniform suppliers). It was adapted on blazers that year and a heraldic description of the arms of the College was published (though not officially registered) in the 1937 Blackrock College Annual. It was commissioned into stained glass in 1938, presumably in its true and intended likeness and survives today at the end of one of the house corridors, though its conformity to the true heraldic interpretations are not accurate; \"a Lion Rampant of the second\" would correctly reveal only a blue silhouette of a rampant lion, that is, minus any fine caricature details so apparent in the existing variations.<ref>(Farragher, S. and Wyer, A.

The members of each house are chosen in second year by the captains, and a student remains within the same house throughout his time at the school. There are two house captains who lead each house in each year, except transition year in which there are three captains per house. They act as leaders and one from each year is chosen to represent the year on the student council. The captains are elected democratically every year by members of their house. They lead house meeting and make sure everyone in their house partakes in the school's various inter house events.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe curriculum offered is broad, covering all common subjects in the State Examinations including Latin, German, Art, Music, Business, Materials Technology Wood, Science and History. Inspections by the Department of Education found exemplary standards of teaching and learning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Inspection-Reports-Publications/Subject-Inspection-Reports-List/60030V_Subject%20Inspection_1149_20161206.pdf |title=Subject Inspection Report - Science 2006 - Blackrock College |publisher=Department of Education and Science |date=14 March 2006 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> The [[Irish Times]] placed the College in the \"Top Ten\" schools in the state, based on the proportion of students who accept a place in Higher or Further Education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1204/1228337399139.html |title=Over 60% of top schools limit admission to certain groups |publisher=The Irish Times |date=12 December 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> There are dedicated facilities for Home Economics and Materials Technology.\n\n== College buildings ==\nThe college consists mainly of two buildings, the junior cycle and transition year building and the more modern senior cycle building. These two buildings are connected via the central St. Patricks Corridor and the entrance corridor. Several other wings contain community facilities as well as other classrooms and subject specific rooms. The quadrangle or \"quad\" is a large green area surrounded by the senior wing, the chapel and St. Mary's Corridor. The campus is {{convert|0.25|km2|acre}} and contains nine rugby pitches, a cricket lawn, an athletics track, an indoor swimming pool, a gym, six tennis courts, basketball courts, hammer throw field and indoor halls.\n\nApart from classrooms and three study halls, there are nine science laboratories, a woodwork room, a radio studio, three computer rooms, a digital communications and graphics room, an art room, a choir hall, a multimedia room and a home economics kitchen. The college also contains a refectory, chapel, creative arts and digital learning centre, lecture halls and stage which hosts student-run dramatic productions. The college is undergoing an extensive modernisation programme, currently the pitches are being transformed and roads around the school rerouted.\n\n==Boarding school==\nThe boarding school is housed in Williamstown Castle (known by students as \"The Castle\"). Williamstown Castle was built around 1780 on lands rented by the Fitzwilliams, later Pembrokes, to Counsellor William Vavasour.  It resembled other spacious houses in the area including Willow Park and Castledawson, but a later owner, Thomas O'Mara, extensively redeveloped the building and its surrounds, adding the castellated finish, hence making it into a 'castle'.  O'Mara had acted as an election agent for [[Daniel O'Connell]], who dined in the Castle on occasion, and for years a portrait of O'Connell adorned the room which is now the oratory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackrockcollegeboardingschool.com/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703003242/http://www.blackrockcollegeboardingschool.com/history.htm |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> Niall MacDermott is the Director of Boarding in the college. The Boarding School contains around 100 students. Boarding is available from first year up to sixth year. Some day boys join the boarding school in 6th year in preparation for their [[Leaving Certificate]]. Boarders are allowed to leave the castle with permission.\n\n== Extra curricular activities ==\n\n=== Field sports ===\nSport is viewed as an integral part of a boy's education and each pupil is expected to participate in some activity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/blackrock/www/index.asp?magpage=7 |title=Blackrock College: About Us: Prospective Students |publisher=Blackrockcollege.ie |accessdate=28 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616021609/http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/blackrock/www/index.asp?magpage=7 |archivedate=16 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The principal sport in the college is rugby, with Blackrock having won the [[Leinster Schools Senior Cup]] 69 times. It has also won the [[Leinster Schools Junior Cup]] 51 times. Blackrock won the inaugural Cup competition held in 1887 and have been consistently the most successful team, winning the Cup at least three times in every decade since.\n\nRetired Blackrock rugby union players include [[Fergus Slattery]], [[Niall Brophy]], [[Hugo MacNeill (rugby union)|Hugo MacNeill]] and [[Brendan Mullin]] (all playing before rugby union was professional), former [[British and Irish Lions]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] and [[Leinster rugby|Leinster]] captain [[Brian O'Driscoll]], [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], [[Victor Costello]],  [[Luke Fitzgerald]], and the current Leinster Rugby Head Coach and former Irish international [[Leo Cullen (rugby union)|Leo Cullen]]. Current professional players include Bristol and Ireland's [[Ian Madigan]], Leinster and Ireland players Garry Ringrose and Jordi Murphy, Munster and Ireland's Andrew Conway and Joey Carbery, Sale Sharks and US Eagles' AJ MacGinty and multiple others around Ireland and the world.\n[[File:Rockleinster.jpg|thumb|250px|Blackrock v St Michael's 2006 [[Leinster Schools Senior Cup]] final at [[Lansdowne Road]]]]\n\n[[Gaelic football]] is played in 4th year in the college. Past pupils [[Mark Vaughan]] and [[Niall Corkery]] are forwards on the [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] [[Gaelic football]] team. The school also has a [[hurling]] team for 2nd and 3rd years. Five members of the All Ireland Club Championship winning Kilmacud Crokes team of 2008\u201309 were past pupils of Blackrock College. The college has a soccer team for its senior pupils in 4th, 5th and 6th year. The soccer team's greatest success came in 2003, when, captained by Steve Dillon, they won the Leinster and All-Ireland U-17s schools cup.\n\n=== Swimming ===\n\nThe college has a strong [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] team, which combines 1st to 6th year. Currently the team has six training sessions per week. The college competes in Leinster Senior Schools and has won the senior relay cup multiple times, most recently in 2017, and the Irish senior schools, regularly making finals and achieving gold in 2017. The college has a strong record of inter-schools galas also. The school has two {{convert|25|m|adj=on}} swimming pools on the grounds. The junior school Willow Park also has a successful swimming team. The college has teams in other water sports such as [[water polo]] and 4th years participate in rowing.\n\n=== Other games===\n\n[[Table tennis]] is another one of the colleges sports with many of its students participating. Many players come from 2nd year with older years fielding less numbers. 2010 saw the Blackrock Senior A team retain the Leinster Schools Senior Cup, won for the first time in 2009, while the seniors also won the Leinster Senior League for the first time since 1968, as well as reaching the final of the Senior All Irelands for the first time. 2010 saw the junior team reach the Junior Cup final for the 3rd year in a row, however in 2008 and 2009 the Blackrock Junior A team completed the Leinster double, with victories in both Junior Cup and Junior League, and also reached the final of the Junior All Irelands in both seasons. In 2010, the Senior A team competed in the World Schools Championships for the first time. It is currently very successful at schools level, completing a 'Treble-Treble' of Leinster League, Leinster Cup and All-Ireland Championship for the past three years.\n\nThe college has its own [[basketball]] team run by teachers as well as professional coaches. Basketball has flourished when it comes to numbers and is also successful. The basketball programme produced Irish and inter provincial school boy representatives in the 1970s such as John and Noel Williams. The college has three outdoor basketball courts and different indoor basketball courts on the grounds. One indoor basketball court is in Willow Park gym, and one in the Jubilee Hall while the introduction of the new sports hall provides a professional basketball court and spectator area.\n\nThe school has a [[tennis]] team divided between minors, juniors and seniors. They practise and play their home matches on the colleges four tennis courts. 1st years in Willow Park also play on the colleges tennis teams. The college also has teams in other sports such as [[cricket]], [[golf]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[Judo]]. Cricket has been played since the foundation of the school in 1860. There has been a renaissance on the cricket pitch in the last 10 years since the building of the new sports hall which is fully equipped with 2 full sized practise lanes. This investment in cricket has helped the college to win its first Junior Cricket Trophy since 1964 and reach their first Senior Cup Final since 1961.\nOther sports such as rowing, badminton and a full athletics programme is also available to name a few.\n\n=== Cycling ===\n\nBlackrock College and Willow Park share a [[cycling]] club called the Willow Wheelers, run by [[Christy McDaid]]. The club has an annual trip abroad to either France or The Netherlands each Easter, recently in Cap D'Agde. It also has hostel trips to Clare and Donegal at the end of the school year. The club has an annual {{convert|160|km|mi|adj=on}} cycle for charity which has raised around 150,000 euro in the past few years. The club cycles every Sunday to varying destinations around Dublin.\n\n=== Athletics ===\n\nThe college has a very successful [[sport of athletics|athletics]] team. The college encourages participation in both track events and field events. The college also has a strong cross country team who compete regionally, with a successful history. The school organises the annual Blackrock College Invitational, inviting top athletic schools ([[CBC Monkstown]], St Gerards School, [[St Michael's College, Dublin]] and [[The King's Hospital]] to compete as a preliminary to the annual provincial and national competitions.\n\nThe athletics team participates in the East Leinster, Leinster and Ireland Athletic championships at under-14s to under-18s annually.\n\n===The arts===\n\nEach year, opera productions are staged in conjunction with [[Mount Anville Secondary School|Mount Anville]] (Senior Musical) and [[Loreto College, Foxrock|Loretto Abbey, Dalkey]] (2nd and 4th Year Musical), two nearby schools for girls.\n\n[[Debating]] is a tradition dating back to the school's founding in the 1860s. There are separate clubs for junior and senior pupils. One of the college alumni, Shane Murphy (now a Senior Counsel), won the 1985 World University Debating Championship at McGill University, representing the Honourable Society of the King's Inns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishdebate.com/universities/results/international.asp#worlds |title=Universities: Hall of Fame: International: World Universities Debating Championships |publisher=British Debate |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> The college holds gold medal debates for every academic year giving the students the opportunity to win the medal on prize day if they win the debate. The gold medal debates are used in sixth year to select an eligible Valedictorian for the year, who give his address at both the graduation mass and again at prize day. The college's debaters participate in many competitions including the L&H debates in UCD.\n\nThe college has two main choirs: the Leman and the Libermann [[choirs]]. The Leman choir has members from 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th year. The best of the senior members of the Leman choir are accepted into the Libermann choir. In 2013, a group of students from the college's Leman choir reached the final of the [[All Island Choir Competition]]. The College has a choir for boarders and another for parents. The College has a successful youth [[orchestra]]. Each year, all the choirs and the orchestra host the annual Leman Concert in the [[National Concert Hall]].\n\n===Blackrock College Radio===\n\nA transition year program to set up and maintain a [[radio]] station, broadcasting to the surrounding south Dublin area, is undertaken annually. All of the administrative work, promotion and content-creation is the labour of transition year students. The station also allows programming submissions from other schools to be broadcast. It's the only second-level radio project that broadcasts nine and a half hours a day (8:00&nbsp;am to 5:30&nbsp;pm), five days a week. The station has a mix of programmes from its current affairs programming to its guest programming. Blackrock College Radio has featured many famous and influential guests including [[Enda Kenny]], while in office as Taoiseach, Neil Flynn, [[Ryan Tubridy]], [[Eamon Gilmore]], Leo Cullen, Mary Hannifin, [[Miche\u00e1l Martin]], [[Ruairi Quinn]], [[Brent Pope (rugby analyst)|Brent Pope]], [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]], The Heathers, [[Bobby Kerr (businessman)|Bobby Kerr]], and [[Denis O'Brien]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2007/1114/1194550268980.html |title=Get an earful of this |publisher=The Irish Times |date=11 November 2007 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rockty.com/BCR.html Blackrock College Transition Year | BCR (Blackrock College Radio) 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117020100/http://www.rockty.com/BCR.html |date=17 November 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bci.ie/licensing/radio/temporary_services_apps.html |title=BCI: Licensing: Radio: Successful applicants for Temporary services |publisher=Broadcasting Commission of Ireland |accessdate=28 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402092214/http://www.bci.ie/licensing/radio/temporary_services_apps.html |archivedate=2 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Seachtain na Gaeilge===\n\nEach year a ''Seachtain na Gaeilge''  (literally, \"Week of Irish\") is organised to promote the Irish language in the school. The Irish department organises events each year to mark this occasion including [[ceili dance]], pioc fada (Longest hit) and screens Irish films. This co-curricular activity was particularly commended in a Department of Education inspection, which also recommended its further development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ie/servlet/blobservlet/report2t_60030V.htm?language=EN |title=Subject Inspection Report - Irish - 2007 |publisher=Department of Education and Science |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Social work==\n\nThe school donates most of its funds raised during the first term (September to October) to St Vincent De Paul and in the second and third terms the focus is mainly on Goal, Aidlink and the Willow Wheelers humanitarian projects; all of which provide international aid.\n\n===GOAL and Aidlink===\nUp until 2017, the Transition Year students organised the annual [[St. Patrick's Day]] Badge appeal which raised large sums of money throughout Ireland for the Irish charities [[GOAL (charity)|GOAL]] and [[Aidlink]]. The students collected on the streets, sold the badges to overseas clients and  to businesses across the country. Goal organized a trip to India in both 2012 and 2013 to the Transition Year boys, inviting them to see the projects which they helped fund through their Badge campaigns. The trip was centred around [[Kolkata]] were Goal's Indian office was situated. The St. Patrick's Day project is estimated to have raised over \u20ac5,000,000 for charity.\n\n===St. Vincent De Paul===\n\nThe school also has a long-standing relationship with The [[Society of St. Vincent de Paul]], contributing large sums of money raised through various projects. For example, the proceeds of the annual sale of [[Christmas tree|Christmas Trees]] in the college are donated. In 2007, the Christmas Tree project raised \u20ac93,000 and the total amount raised for the Society in that year is estimated to be in excess of \u20ac150,000. Other projects for St Vincent De Paul include the Second and third year duck races, which raise money through sponsorship. Christmas Hampers are also packed and delivered by students and their families in the run-up to the holiday. This provides some families with the necessary supplies of food for the period.\n\n===Willow Wheelers===\n\nThe College supports humanitarian projects in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], mainly through the college's cycling club, the [http://www.willowwheelers.ie/ Willow Wheelers]. In 2006, their annual sponsored {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} cycle raised in excess of \u20ac60,000. The club also annually sends a group of self-funded volunteers to help with humanitarian projects in Africa, most commonly: establishing clean water supplies for villages and constructing schoolhouses, infirmaries or similar institutions. Transition year students who are members of the cycling club are invited to see the club's projects throughout the world, and understand how their raised funds are spent. The students usually visit [[Ethiopia]], and have visited [[Vietnam]].\n\n===Rock Reaches Out To Kenya===\nThis an initiative to build a school in Kenya to help educate the country's future leaders. The school's 6th year students have the opportunity to travel to the school every year after the leaving certificate examinations. The school is to be run by the Spiritans, who also run Blackrock College.\n\n===Past pupils' efforts===\n\n[[Bob Geldof]], initiator of the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] and [[Live Aid]] movements for famine relief in the 1980s, was a student at the college. [[Frank Duff]], the founder of the [[Legion of Mary]], the Catholic [[Laity|lay]] movement, is also a past pupil. In his memoirs, ''Straight Left: A Journey in Politics'' [[Ruairi Quinn]] cites the ethos and \"sense of solidarity\" with the Third World that was imparted to students, including Bob Geldof, as a formative force. The Holy Ghost Fathers were (and remain) an active missionary order in Africa.<ref>Quinn, Ruairi, Straight Left: A Journey in Politics, 2005, Dublin, Hodder Headline Ireland</ref> He wrote:\n\n{{quote|The poverty of distant Africa was brought into our classrooms by our returned missionary teachers.|author=[[Ruairi Quinn]]|source=''Straight Left'', pg. 36}}\n\n==Associated primary schools==\n[[Willow Park School, Dublin|Willow Park School]], a private [[primary school]] that acts as the College's principal feeder, is also run by the Order and is situated on the same campus. Until the early 1970s, [[St. Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]] in [[Ballsbridge]] was also a feeder school for Blackrock College, but St Michael's now has classes up to the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]].\n\n==Past pupils==\n\n{{Main|List of Old Rockmen}}\n\nThe Blackrock College Union represents former students of the college, organises many charitable events throughout the year, assists the school (e.g., mentoring, management assistance, advice) and organises social events for members. There are branches in Ireland and across the world.\n\nBlackrock's large enrolment and high standards have produced many distinguished alumni through its long history. Early Free State ministers such as [[Art O'Connor]] (Secretary for Agriculture 1921\u20131922), and [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], six times Taoiseach and the 3rd President of Ireland, studied and later taught in Blackrock. Modern politicians include [[Eoin O'Broin]] TD, [[Ruairi Quinn]] ( a former Minister and Leader of the Labour Party) and [[Barry Andrews (politician)|Barry Andrews]], a former junior Minister. Many prominent businessmen have also attended the school such as [[David J. O'Reilly]], chairman and former CEO of Chevron Corporation, and [[Brendan O'Regan|Dr. Brendan O'Regan]] [[CBE]], founder of [[Shannon Airport]] and proponent of the Irish peace and reconciliation process. [[Philip R. Lane]] (Governor of the Central Bank), [[Ronan Dunne]] (EVP and Group President Verizon Wireless).\n\n[[Flann O'Brien]], the eminent writer (real name: Brian O'Nolan) and [[Tim Pat Coogan]], the journalist and scholar, were students of the school. Alumni in the fine arts include designer [[Paul Costelloe]], composer [[Michael McGlynn]] and visual artist [[Robert Ballagh]]. The Holy Ghost Order has a long tradition of missionaries. [[Frank Duff (religious worker)|Frank Duff]], founder of the [[Legion of Mary]], is perhaps the best-known. Singer, songwriter, author and [[political activist]] [[Bob Geldof]] was also a student at the College. Eminent handbag designer [[Pauric Sweeney]] also calls Blackrock his alma mater. Radio and TV personality [[Ryan Tubridy]] attended the college. Singer-songwriter and producer [[Jonathon Ng]] (better known as EDEN) attended Blackrock, and in 2014 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRCE7ZV-sNM a video] was posted on the college's YouTube account of Ng performing a song entitled \"Amnesia\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRCE7ZV-sNM|title=Amnesia - Vocal Solo - Jonathon Ng|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe college places a heavy emphasis on sport. Past pupils include Ireland internationals [[Brian O'Driscoll]] former Ireland and Lions captain, [[Luke Fitzgerald]], [[Victor Costello]], a 20-year Leinster, Ireland and Blackrock College RFC veteran, who also represented Ireland in shot putting at the Olympics, [[Leo Cullen (rugby union)|Leo Cullen]], former captain, now coach of the [[Leinster Rugby]] team and [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], Leinster and Ireland professional rugby player.\nThe current Ireland international team includes [[Ian Madigan]],  [[Jordi Murphy]], [[Garry Ringrose]], [[Andrew Conway]] and [[Joey Carbery]],\nOther Rugby Internationals Include [[Vasily Artemyev]] (formerly of Russia), [[AJ MacGinty]] (USA) and [[Dylan Fawsitt]] (USA)\n\nIn other games, [[Michael Cusack]], founder of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] taught at the school, and played early forms of [[hurling]] with the pupils. Golfer [[John O'Leary (golfer)|John O'Leary]] (winner of the Carrolls Irish Open), [[Alan Lee (footballer)|Alan Lee]] (Ireland soccer international) and Joey O'Meara (who represented Ireland in both Hockey and Cricket), also went to Blackrock. Current Dublin footballer [[Cian O\u2019Sullivan]] and golfer [[Paul Dunne (golfer)|Paul Dunne]] attended the college.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/ Blackrock College] - official website\n\n{{Spiritan secondary schools in Ireland}}\n{{Schools and colleges in County Dublin}}\n{{Private schools in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:Boys' schools in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Private schools in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1860]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n[[Category:Catholic boarding schools]]\n[[Category:Blackrock, Dublin]]\n[[Category:Boarding schools in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Spiritan schools]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the rugby union club|Blackrock College RFC}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{Infobox school\n|type              = [[Voluntary secondary school|Voluntary]] <br /> [[day school|day]] and [[boarding school]]\n|name              = Blackrock College\n|native_name       = Col\u00e1iste na Carraige Duibhe\n|latin_name        = \n|logo              = \n|seal_image        = \n|image             = Blackrock crest.png\n|alt               = \n|caption           = \n|motto             = Fides Et Robur\n|motto_translation = Faith and Strength\n|religion          = [[Roman Catholic]] ([[Holy Ghost Fathers]])\n|location          = [[Williamstown, Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], [[County Dublin]]\n|country           = [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]\n|coordinates       = {{Coord|53|18|17|N|6|11|30|W|region:IE_type:edu|display=inline,title}}\n|established       = {{Start date and age|1860  }}\n|president         = Fr Cormac \u00d3 Brolch\u00e1in, [[Holy Ghost Fathers|CSSp]]\n|principal         = Alan McGinty\n|sister_school     = [[St. Mary's School, Nairobi|St. Mary's School]]\n|years             = 2nd\u20136th\n|gender            = Male\n|lower_age         = 12\n|upper_age        = 19\n|houses            = DeValera, Duff, Ebenrecht, Leman, McQuaid, Shanahan\n|students          = 1000 (200 per year)\n|staff             = 75 full time, 25 part time\n|colours           = {{color box|blue}}{{color box|white}} [[Blue]] and [[white]]\n|free_label        = Religious order\n|free_text         = [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] ([[Spiritans]])\n|free_label2       = \n|free_text2        = \u20ac6,500 (day) / \u20ac17,250 (boarding)\n|homepage          = [http://www.blackrockcollege.com blackrockcollege.com]\n}}\n\n'''Blackrock College''' ({{lang-ga|Col\u00e1iste na Carraige Duibhe}}) is a [[voluntary secondary school|voluntary]] [[day school|day]] and [[boarding school|boarding]] [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[secondary school]] for boys aged 13\u201318, in Williamstown, [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]], [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It was founded by French missionary P\u00e9re Jules Leman [[CSSp]] in 1860 as a school and civil service training centre.\n\nThe college, {{convert|7|km|miles}} from Dublin city centre, is just in from the sea, and is self-contained, with large boarding and teaching facilities in 56 acres of rolling parkland. It accommodates approximately 1,000 day and boarding students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/files/admin/uploads/W47_F_1279_6639.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=24 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119060046/http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/files/admin/uploads/W47_F_1279_6639.doc |archivedate=19 November 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nNow run by a lay foundation in trust, it maintains academic standards and requires all pupils to participate in non-academic activities, and it has a strong sporting tradition. The missionary tradition continues with charity programmes, especially at Christmas.\n\n==History==\nThe college was founded by the [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Congregation of the Holy Ghost]] in 1860, the first of the Order's five schools in Ireland. The founder is listed as Fr (P\u00e8re) Jules Leman, a French missionary with the Holy Ghost Order. Leman had a dual aim, namely to train personnel for missionary service in the Third World and provide a first class Catholic education for Irish boys. It was originally known as the ''French College'' by the locals. A successful [[civil service]] training and university department (where students were examined and had degrees conferred by the [[Royal University of Ireland]]) were run for over forty years, until [[University College Dublin]] grew, and the school focused more on the second level curriculum.\n\nAlthough never a seminary, some ordinations have taken place in Blackrock. The first ordination at Blackrock College was on 22 April 1900 when Mgr. Emile Allgeyer CSSp (a former student in Blackrock and first to be made a bishop), ordained [[Joseph (Ignatius) Shanahan|Joseph Shanahan]] who later became a bishop, and has a House named after him within the school.<ref>[http://www.spiritan.org/shanahan_profile.html Bishop Joseph Shanahan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010217113518/http://www.spiritan.org/shanahan_profile.html |date=17 February 2001 }} www.spiritan.org.</ref> From 1924 until 1933 the Holy Ghost Fathers studied Theology at Blackrock Castle, before returning to Kimmage Manor.\n\nIn June 1932, college President [[John Charles McQuaid]], hosted a large garden party on the grounds of the college to welcome the papal legate, [[Lorenzo Lauri]], where the many hundreds of bishops assembled for the [[Eucharistic Congress of Dublin (1932)]] had the opportunity to mingle with a huge gathering of distinguished guests, including President of the Executive Council, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], and others who had paid a modest subscription fee.<ref>The Church in Dublin: 1940-1965, by Roland Burke Savage, Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review, Winter 1965</ref>\n\n===Heraldry===\nThe crest of the college is the third creation, dating back to 1936 and explained in the 1937 College Annual as being: <blockquote>The Heraldic Crest Of The College. ARGENT: - On a Cross Azure, the Dove of the Holy Ghost, Proper, with seven Rays descendant, Or. In the first quarter a Lion rampant of the second.</blockquote>\n\nOn 30 April 1926, Fr. Leen at a sports day speech encapsulated the words ''Fides Et Robur'' which henceforth became the Rock motto. In 1928, a new College Crest, bearing four emblems around a blue cross was hurriedly officiated, primarily to show off the Fides Et Robur motto over the College's especially built new front gates. Not everyone was happy with this design and possible variations of a new design may have been experimented with; evidence exists that both in crest and in uniform, by reason of fault or debate, and most likely between 1928 and 1936, a distinctive crest had been \"with nine rays descendant, Or\". In 1936, Dr. McQuaid instigated a new and distinctive crest that to this day is in continual use (unchecked variations and wayward deviations are contracted into stores by stationery and uniform suppliers). It was adapted on blazers that year and a heraldic description of the arms of the College was published (though not officially registered) in the 1937 Blackrock College Annual. It was commissioned into stained glass in 1938, presumably in its true and intended likeness and survives today at the end of one of the house corridors, though its conformity to the true heraldic interpretations are not accurate; \"a Lion Rampant of the second\" would correctly reveal only a blue silhouette of a rampant lion, that is, minus any fine caricature details so apparent in the existing variations.<ref>(Farragher, S. and Wyer, A.

The members of each house are chosen in second year by the captains, and a student remains within the same house throughout his time at the school. There are two house captains who lead each house in each year, except transition year in which there are three captains per house. They act as leaders and one from each year is chosen to represent the year on the student council. The captains are elected democratically every year by members of their house. They lead house meeting and make sure everyone in their house partakes in the school's various inter house events.\n\n==Curriculum==\nThe curriculum offered is broad, covering all common subjects in the State Examinations including Latin, German, Art, Music, Business, Materials Technology Wood, Science and History. Inspections by the Department of Education found exemplary standards of teaching and learning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.education.ie/en/Publications/Inspection-Reports-Publications/Subject-Inspection-Reports-List/60030V_Subject%20Inspection_1149_20161206.pdf |title=Subject Inspection Report - Science 2006 - Blackrock College |publisher=Department of Education and Science |date=14 March 2006 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> The [[Irish Times]] placed the College in the \"Top Ten\" schools in the state, based on the proportion of students who accept a place in Higher or Further Education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2008/1204/1228337399139.html |title=Over 60% of top schools limit admission to certain groups |publisher=The Irish Times |date=12 December 2008 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> There are dedicated facilities for Home Economics and Materials Technology.\n\n== College buildings ==\nThe college consists mainly of two buildings, the junior cycle and transition year building and the more modern senior cycle building. These two buildings are connected via the central St. Patricks Corridor and the entrance corridor. Several other wings contain community facilities as well as other classrooms and subject specific rooms. The quadrangle or \"quad\" is a large green area surrounded by the senior wing, the chapel and St. Mary's Corridor. The campus is {{convert|0.25|km2|acre}} and contains nine rugby pitches, a cricket lawn, an athletics track, an indoor swimming pool, a gym, six tennis courts, basketball courts, hammer throw field and indoor halls.\n\nApart from classrooms and three study halls, there are nine science laboratories, a woodwork room, a radio studio, three computer rooms, a digital communications and graphics room, an art room, a choir hall, a multimedia room and a home economics kitchen. The college also contains a refectory, chapel, creative arts and digital learning centre, lecture halls and stage which hosts student-run dramatic productions. The college is undergoing an extensive modernisation programme, currently the pitches are being transformed and roads around the school rerouted.\n\n==Boarding school==\nThe boarding school is housed in Williamstown Castle (known by students as \"The Castle\"). Williamstown Castle was built around 1780 on lands rented by the Fitzwilliams, later Pembrokes, to Counsellor William Vavasour.  It resembled other spacious houses in the area including Willow Park and Castledawson, but a later owner, Thomas O'Mara, extensively redeveloped the building and its surrounds, adding the castellated finish, hence making it into a 'castle'.  O'Mara had acted as an election agent for [[Daniel O'Connell]], who dined in the Castle on occasion, and for years a portrait of O'Connell adorned the room which is now the oratory.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackrockcollegeboardingschool.com/history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703003242/http://www.blackrockcollegeboardingschool.com/history.htm |archivedate=3 July 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> Niall MacDermott is the Director of Boarding in the college. The Boarding School contains around 100 students. Boarding is available from first year up to sixth year. Some day boys join the boarding school in 6th year in preparation for their [[Leaving Certificate]]. Boarders are allowed to leave the castle with permission.\n\n== Extra curricular activities ==\n\n=== Field sports ===\nSport is viewed as an integral part of a boy's education and each pupil is expected to participate in some activity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/blackrock/www/index.asp?magpage=7 |title=Blackrock College: About Us: Prospective Students |publisher=Blackrockcollege.ie |accessdate=28 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616021609/http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/blackrock/www/index.asp?magpage=7 |archivedate=16 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The principal sport in the college is rugby, with Blackrock having won the [[Leinster Schools Senior Cup]] 69 times. It has also won the [[Leinster Schools Junior Cup]] 51 times. Blackrock won the inaugural Cup competition held in 1887 and have been consistently the most successful team, winning the Cup at least three times in every decade since.\n\nRetired Blackrock rugby union players include [[Fergus Slattery]], [[Niall Brophy]], [[Hugo MacNeill (rugby union)|Hugo MacNeill]] and [[Brendan Mullin]] (all playing before rugby union was professional), former [[British and Irish Lions]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] and [[Leinster rugby|Leinster]] captain [[Brian O'Driscoll]], [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], [[Victor Costello]],  [[Luke Fitzgerald]], and the current Leinster Rugby Head Coach and former Irish international [[Leo Cullen (rugby union)|Leo Cullen]]. Current professional players include Bristol and Ireland's [[Ian Madigan]], Leinster and Ireland players Garry Ringrose and Jordi Murphy, Munster and Ireland's Andrew Conway and Joey Carbery, Sale Sharks and US Eagles' AJ MacGinty and multiple others around Ireland and the world.\n[[File:Rockleinster.jpg|thumb|250px|Blackrock v St Michael's 2006 [[Leinster Schools Senior Cup]] final at [[Lansdowne Road]]]]\n\n[[Gaelic football]] is played in 4th year in the college. Past pupils [[Mark Vaughan]] and [[Niall Corkery]] are forwards on the [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] [[Gaelic football]] team. The school also has a [[hurling]] team for 2nd and 3rd years. Five members of the All Ireland Club Championship winning Kilmacud Crokes team of 2008\u201309 were past pupils of Blackrock College. The college has a soccer team for its senior pupils in 4th, 5th and 6th year. The soccer team's greatest success came in 2003, when, captained by Steve Dillon, they won the Leinster and All-Ireland U-17s schools cup.\n\n=== Swimming ===\n\nThe college has a strong [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] team, which combines 1st to 6th year. Currently the team has six training sessions per week. The college competes in Leinster Senior Schools and has won the senior relay cup multiple times, most recently in 2017, and the Irish senior schools, regularly making finals and achieving gold in 2017. The college has a strong record of inter-schools galas also. The school has two {{convert|25|m|adj=on}} swimming pools on the grounds. The junior school Willow Park also has a successful swimming team. The college has teams in other water sports such as [[water polo]] and 4th years participate in rowing.\n\n=== Other games===\n\n[[Table tennis]] is another one of the colleges sports with many of its students participating. Many players come from 2nd year with older years fielding less numbers. 2010 saw the Blackrock Senior A team retain the Leinster Schools Senior Cup, won for the first time in 2009, while the seniors also won the Leinster Senior League for the first time since 1968, as well as reaching the final of the Senior All Irelands for the first time. 2010 saw the junior team reach the Junior Cup final for the 3rd year in a row, however in 2008 and 2009 the Blackrock Junior A team completed the Leinster double, with victories in both Junior Cup and Junior League, and also reached the final of the Junior All Irelands in both seasons. In 2010, the Senior A team competed in the World Schools Championships for the first time. It is currently very successful at schools level, completing a 'Treble-Treble' of Leinster League, Leinster Cup and All-Ireland Championship for the past three years.\n\nThe college has its own [[basketball]] team run by teachers as well as professional coaches. Basketball has flourished when it comes to numbers and is also successful. The basketball programme produced Irish and inter provincial school boy representatives in the 1970s such as John and Noel Williams. The college has three outdoor basketball courts and different indoor basketball courts on the grounds. One indoor basketball court is in Willow Park gym, and one in the Jubilee Hall while the introduction of the new sports hall provides a professional basketball court and spectator area.\n\nThe school has a [[tennis]] team divided between minors, juniors and seniors. They practise and play their home matches on the colleges four tennis courts. 1st years in Willow Park also play on the colleges tennis teams. The college also has teams in other sports such as [[cricket]], [[golf]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[Judo]]. Cricket has been played since the foundation of the school in 1860. There has been a renaissance on the cricket pitch in the last 10 years since the building of the new sports hall which is fully equipped with 2 full sized practise lanes. This investment in cricket has helped the college to win its first Junior Cricket Trophy since 1964 and reach their first Senior Cup Final since 1961.\nOther sports such as rowing, badminton and a full athletics programme is also available to name a few.\n\n=== Cycling ===\n\nBlackrock College and Willow Park share a [[cycling]] club called the Willow Wheelers, run by [[Christy McDaid]]. The club has an annual trip abroad to either France or The Netherlands each Easter, recently in Cap D'Agde. It also has hostel trips to Clare and Donegal at the end of the school year. The club has an annual {{convert|160|km|mi|adj=on}} cycle for charity which has raised around 150,000 euro in the past few years. The club cycles every Sunday to varying destinations around Dublin.\n\n=== Athletics ===\n\nThe college has a very successful [[sport of athletics|athletics]] team. The college encourages participation in both track events and field events. The college also has a strong cross country team who compete regionally, with a successful history. The school organises the annual Blackrock College Invitational, inviting top athletic schools ([[CBC Monkstown]], St Gerards School, [[St Michael's College, Dublin]] and [[The King's Hospital]] to compete as a preliminary to the annual provincial and national competitions.\n\nThe athletics team participates in the East Leinster, Leinster and Ireland Athletic championships at under-14s to under-18s annually.\n\n===The arts===\n\nEach year, opera productions are staged in conjunction with [[Mount Anville Secondary School|Mount Anville]] (Senior Musical) and [[Loreto College, Foxrock|Loretto Abbey, Dalkey]] (2nd and 4th Year Musical), two nearby schools for girls.\n\n[[Debating]] is a tradition dating back to the school's founding in the 1860s. There are separate clubs for junior and senior pupils. One of the college alumni, Shane Murphy (now a Senior Counsel), won the 1985 World University Debating Championship at McGill University, representing the Honourable Society of the King's Inns.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishdebate.com/universities/results/international.asp#worlds |title=Universities: Hall of Fame: International: World Universities Debating Championships |publisher=British Debate |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref> The college holds gold medal debates for every academic year giving the students the opportunity to win the medal on prize day if they win the debate. The gold medal debates are used in sixth year to select an eligible Valedictorian for the year, who give his address at both the graduation mass and again at prize day. The college's debaters participate in many competitions including the L&H debates in UCD.\n\nThe college has two main choirs: the Leman and the Libermann [[choirs]]. The Leman choir has members from 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th year. The best of the senior members of the Leman choir are accepted into the Libermann choir.

The College has a successful youth [[orchestra]]. Each year, all the choirs and the orchestra host the annual Leman Concert in the [[National Concert Hall]].\n\n===Blackrock College Radio===\n\nA transition year program to set up and maintain a [[radio]] station, broadcasting to the surrounding south Dublin area, is undertaken annually. All of the administrative work, promotion and content-creation is the labour of transition year students. The station also allows programming submissions from other schools to be broadcast. It's the only second-level radio project that broadcasts nine and a half hours a day (8:00&nbsp;am to 5:30&nbsp;pm), five days a week. The station has a mix of programmes from its current affairs programming to its guest programming.

The Irish department organises events each year to mark this occasion including [[ceili dance]], pioc fada (Longest hit) and screens Irish films. This co-curricular activity was particularly commended in a Department of Education inspection, which also recommended its further development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.ie/servlet/blobservlet/report2t_60030V.htm?language=EN |title=Subject Inspection Report - Irish - 2007 |publisher=Department of Education and Science |date=7 December 2007 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Social work==\n\nThe school donates most of its funds raised during the first term (September to October) to St Vincent De Paul and in the second and third terms the focus is mainly on Goal, Aidlink and the Willow Wheelers humanitarian projects; all of which provide international aid.\n\n===GOAL and Aidlink===\nUp until 2017, the Transition Year students organised the annual [[St. Patrick's Day]] Badge appeal which raised large sums of money throughout Ireland for the Irish charities [[GOAL (charity)|GOAL]] and [[Aidlink]]. The students collected on the streets, sold the badges to overseas clients and  to businesses across the country. Goal organized a trip to India in both 2012 and 2013 to the Transition Year boys, inviting them to see the projects which they helped fund through their Badge campaigns. The trip was centred around [[Kolkata]] were Goal's Indian office was situated. The St. Patrick's Day project is estimated to have raised over \u20ac5,000,000 for charity.\n\n===St. Vincent De Paul===\n\nThe school also has a long-standing relationship with The [[Society of St. Vincent de Paul]], contributing large sums of money raised through various projects. For example, the proceeds of the annual sale of [[Christmas tree|Christmas Trees]] in the college are donated. In 2007, the Christmas Tree project raised \u20ac93,000 and the total amount raised for the Society in that year is estimated to be in excess of \u20ac150,000. Other projects for St Vincent De Paul include the Second and third year duck races, which raise money through sponsorship. Christmas Hampers are also packed and delivered by students and their families in the run-up to the holiday. This provides some families with the necessary supplies of food for the period.\n\n===Willow Wheelers===\n\nThe College supports humanitarian projects in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], mainly through the college's cycling club, the [http://www.willowwheelers.ie/ Willow Wheelers]. In 2006, their annual sponsored {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} cycle raised in excess of \u20ac60,000. The club also annually sends a group of self-funded volunteers to help with humanitarian projects in Africa, most commonly: establishing clean water supplies for villages and constructing schoolhouses, infirmaries or similar institutions. Transition year students who are members of the cycling club are invited to see the club's projects throughout the world, and understand how their raised funds are spent. The students usually visit [[Ethiopia]], and have visited [[Vietnam]].\n\n===Rock Reaches Out To Kenya===\nThis an initiative to build a school in Kenya to help educate the country's future leaders. The school's 6th year students have the opportunity to travel to the school every year after the leaving certificate examinations. The school is to be run by the Spiritans, who also run Blackrock College.\n\n===Past pupils' efforts===\n\n[[Bob Geldof]], initiator of the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] and [[Live Aid]] movements for famine relief in the 1980s, was a student at the college. [[Frank Duff]], the founder of the [[Legion of Mary]], the Catholic [[Laity|lay]] movement, is also a past pupil. In his memoirs, ''Straight Left: A Journey in Politics'' [[Ruairi Quinn]] cites the ethos and \"sense of solidarity\" with the Third World that was imparted to students, including Bob Geldof, as a formative force. The Holy Ghost Fathers were (and remain) an active missionary order in Africa.<ref>Quinn, Ruairi, Straight Left: A Journey in Politics, 2005, Dublin, Hodder Headline Ireland</ref> He wrote:\n\n{{quote|The poverty of distant Africa was brought into our classrooms by our returned missionary teachers.|author=[[Ruairi Quinn]]|source=''Straight Left'', pg. 36}}\n\n==Associated primary schools==\n[[Willow Park School, Dublin|Willow Park School]], a private [[primary school]] that acts as the College's principal feeder, is also run by the Order and is situated on the same campus. Until the early 1970s, [[St. Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]] in [[Ballsbridge]] was also a feeder school for Blackrock College, but St Michael's now has classes up to the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]].\n\n==Past pupils==\n\n{{Main|List of Old Rockmen}}\n\nThe Blackrock College Union represents former students of the college, organises many charitable events throughout the year, assists the school (e.g., mentoring, management assistance, advice) and organises social events for members. There are branches in Ireland and across the world.\n\nBlackrock's large enrolment and high standards have produced many distinguished alumni through its long history. Early Free State ministers such as [[Art O'Connor]] (Secretary for Agriculture 1921\u20131922), and [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], six times Taoiseach and the 3rd President of Ireland, studied and later taught in Blackrock. Modern politicians include [[Eoin O'Broin]] TD, [[Ruairi Quinn]] ( a former Minister and Leader of the Labour Party) and [[Barry Andrews (politician)|Barry Andrews]], a former junior Minister. Many prominent businessmen have also attended the school such as [[David J. O'Reilly]], chairman and former CEO of Chevron Corporation, and [[Brendan O'Regan|Dr. Brendan O'Regan]] [[CBE]], founder of [[Shannon Airport]] and proponent of the Irish peace and reconciliation process. [[Philip R. Lane]] (Governor of the Central Bank), [[Ronan Dunne]] (EVP and Group President Verizon Wireless).\n\n[[Flann O'Brien]], the eminent writer (real name: Brian O'Nolan) and [[Tim Pat Coogan]], the journalist and scholar, were students of the school. Alumni in the fine arts include designer [[Paul Costelloe]], composer [[Michael McGlynn]] and visual artist [[Robert Ballagh]]. The Holy Ghost Order has a long tradition of missionaries. [[Frank Duff (religious worker)|Frank Duff]], founder of the [[Legion of Mary]], is perhaps the best-known. Singer, songwriter, author and [[political activist]] [[Bob Geldof]] was also a student at the College. Eminent handbag designer [[Pauric Sweeney]] also calls Blackrock his alma mater. Radio and TV personality [[Ryan Tubridy]] attended the college. Singer-songwriter and producer [[Jonathon Ng]] (better known as EDEN) attended Blackrock, and in 2014 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRCE7ZV-sNM a video] was posted on the college's YouTube account of Ng performing a song entitled \"Amnesia\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRCE7ZV-sNM|title=Amnesia - Vocal Solo - Jonathon Ng|last=|first=|date=|website=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe college places a heavy emphasis on sport. Past pupils include Ireland internationals [[Brian O'Driscoll]] former Ireland and Lions captain, [[Luke Fitzgerald]], [[Victor Costello]], a 20-year Leinster, Ireland and Blackrock College RFC veteran, who also represented Ireland in shot putting at the Olympics, [[Leo Cullen (rugby union)|Leo Cullen]], former captain, now coach of the [[Leinster Rugby]] team and [[Shane Byrne (rugby player)|Shane Byrne]], Leinster and Ireland professional rugby player.\nThe current Ireland international team includes [[Ian Madigan]],  [[Jordi Murphy]], [[Garry Ringrose]], [[Andrew Conway]] and [[Joey Carbery]],\nOther Rugby Internationals Include [[Vasily Artemyev]] (formerly of Russia), [[AJ MacGinty]] (USA) and [[Dylan Fawsitt]] (USA)\n\nIn other games, [[Michael Cusack]], founder of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] taught at the school, and played early forms of [[hurling]] with the pupils. Golfer [[John O'Leary (golfer)|John O'Leary]] (winner of the Carrolls Irish Open), [[Alan Lee (footballer)|Alan Lee]] (Ireland soccer international) and Joey O'Meara (who represented Ireland in both Hockey and Cricket), also went to Blackrock. Current Dublin footballer [[Cian O\u2019Sullivan]] and golfer [[Paul Dunne (golfer)|Paul Dunne]] attended the college.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.blackrockcollege.ie/ Blackrock College] - official website\n\n{{Spiritan secondary schools in Ireland}}\n{{Schools and colleges in County Dublin}}\n{{Private schools in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\n[[Category:Boys' schools in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Private schools in the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1860]]\n[[Category:Secondary schools in D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown]]\n[[Category:Catholic boarding schools]]\n[[Category:Blackrock, Dublin]]\n[[Category:Boarding schools in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Spiritan schools]]\n", "name_user": "188.141.102.7", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackrock_College"}

According to Bragg he wrote the lyrics whilst playing with his band Riff Raff in 1977: whilst the band played \"Route 66\" as part of their set, Bragg \"objected to singing about these places that (he) didn't know... there's a tradition of driving down the A13 to the glory of Southend. Growing up in Barking, that was the promised land, in quite a Springsteenish way\". The song was originally meant to be released on Bragg's 1983 debut album ''[[Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy]]''; however, it was ultimately not included due to problems getting permission to use the music of \"Route 66\". It was finally released commercially on the bonus disc of the 2003 compilation ''[[Must I Paint You a Picture?

A minimum standard of academic attainment may be required for entry, for certain technical roles, or for entry to train for a leadership position as a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]. Candidates who meet the criteria will normally also undergo [[Aptitude|aptitude test]], [[medical examination]], psychological interview, job interview and fitness assessment.\n\nDepending on whether the application criteria are met, and depending also on which military units have vacancies for new recruits, candidates may or may not be offered a job in a certain role or roles. Candidates who accept a job offer then wait for their [[recruit training]] to begin. Either at or before the start of their training, candidates swear or affirm an [[oath of allegiance]] and/or sign their joining papers.\n\nThe period between the initial application to swearing the oath may be several weeks or months. During this time many candidates drop out.

At other times, techniques similar to those outlined above have been used. The most prominent concern over the years has been the minimum age for recruitment, which has been 16 for many years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/117504.stm | work=BBC News | title=Marching orders for teenage soldiers? | date=June 22, 1998 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> This has now been raised to 18 in relation to combat operations.

Today there are thousands of recruiting stations across the United States, serving the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force.  Recruiting offices normally consist of 2\u20138 recruiters between the ranks of E-5 and E-7.  When a potential applicant walks into a recruiting station his or her height and weight are checked and their background investigated.  A finger print scan is conducted and a practice ASVAB exam is given to them.  Applicants can not officially swear their enlistment oath in the recruiting office.  This is conducted at a Military Entrance Processing Station \u2013 MEPS.\n\n=== Wartime recruitment strategies in the US ===\n{{Further|Recruitment in the United States Military|Conscription in the United States}}\n[[File:Find the range of your patriotism2.jpg|thumb|[[United States Navy]] recruitment poster from 1918. Note the appeal to [[patriotism]]. (Digitally restored).]]\nPrior to the outbreak of World War I, military recruitment in the US was conducted primarily by individual states.<ref name=\"Padilla, Peter A 1953. Page 423\">Padilla, Peter A. and Mary Riege Laner. \u201cTrends in Military Influences on Army Recruitment: 1915-1953.\u201d Sociological Inquiry, Vol. 71, No. 4. Fall 2001421-36. Austin: University of Texas Press. Page 423</ref> Upon entering the war, however, the federal government took an increased role.\n\nThe increased emphasis on a national effort was reflected in World War I recruitment methods. Peter A. Padilla and Mary Riege Laner define six basic appeals to these recruitment campaigns: [[patriotism]], job/career/education, adventure/challenge, [[social status]], travel, and miscellaneous.  Between 1915 and 1918, 42% of all army recruitment posters were themed primarily by patriotism.<ref name=\"Padilla, Peter A 1953. Page 423\"/> And though other themes \u2013 such as adventure and greater social status \u2013 would play an increased role during World War II recruitment, appeals to serve one's country remained the dominant selling point.\n\n====Recruitment without conscription====\nIn the [[aftermath of World War II]] military recruitment shifted significantly. With no war calling men and women to duty, the United States refocused its recruitment efforts to present the military as a career option, and as a means of achieving a higher education. A majority \u2013 55% \u2013 of all recruitment posters would serve this end. And though peacetime would not last, factors such as the move to an all-volunteer military would ultimately keep career-oriented recruitment efforts in place.<ref>Padilla, Peter A. and Mary Riege Laner. \"Trends in Military Influences on Army Recruitment: 1915-1953.\" Sociological Inquiry, Vol. 71, No. 4. Fall 2001421-36. Austin: University of Texas Press. Page 433</ref>  The Defense Department turned to television syndication as a recruiting aid from 1957\u20131960 with a filmed show, ''[[Country Style, USA]]''.\n\nOn February 20, 1970, the [[Project VOLAR|President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force]] unanimously agreed that the United States would be best served by an all-volunteer military. In supporting this recommendation, the committee noted that recruitment efforts would have to be intensified, as new enlistees would need to be ''convinced'' rather than ''conscripted''. Much like the post-World War II era, these new campaigns put a stronger emphasis on job opportunity. As such, the committee recommended \"improved basic compensation and conditions of service, proficiency pay, and accelerated promotions for the highly skilled to make military career opportunities more attractive.\" These new directives were to be combined with \"an intensive recruiting effort.\"<ref>The Report of the President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1970. Page 18.</ref>   Finalized in mid-1973, the recruitment of a \"professional\" military was met with success. In 1975 and 1976, military enlistments exceeded expectations, with over 365,000 men and women entering the military. Though this may, in part, have been the result of a lack of civilian jobs during the recession, it nevertheless stands to underline the ways in which recruiting efforts responded to the circumstances of the time.<ref>Bliven, Bruce Jr. Volunteers, One and All. New York: Readers Digest Press, 1976. {{ISBN|0-88349-058-7}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, recommendations made by the President's Commission continue to work in present-day recruitment efforts. Understanding the need for greater individual incentive, the US military has re-packaged the benefits of the [[GI Bill]]. Though originally intended as compensation for service, the bill is now seen as a recruiting tool. Today, the GI Bill is \"no longer a reward for service rendered, but an inducement to serve and has become a significant part of recruiter's pitches.\"<ref>White, John B. Lieutenant Commander, US Naval Reserve, Ph. D. \"The GI Bill: Recruiting Bonus, Retention Onus.\" Military Review, July\u2013August 2004.</ref>\n\n====Recruiting methods====\n\nRecruitment can be conducted over the telephone with organized lists, through email campaigns and from face to face prospecting. While telephone prospecting is the most efficient, face to face prospecting is the most effective. Military recruiters often set up booths at amusement parks, sports stadiums and other attractions. In recent years social media has been more commonly used.\n\n====Controversy====\n{{Main|Counter-recruitment#Arguments surrounding recruitment}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Military recruitment}}\n[[Image:Floor area and war recruitment posters at Columbia Institute of War and Peace Studies.jpg|thumb|right|World War I recruitment posters featured as part of the decor at the [[Institute of War and Peace Studies]] at [[Columbia University]], as part of understanding the psychological forces behind recruiting efforts]]\n\n=== Related military articles ===\n* [[Military service]]\n* [[Women in the military]]\n* [[Children in the military]]\n* [[Transgender people and military service]]\n* [[Counter-recruitment]]\n* [[Conscription]] and [[Impressment]]\n* [[Recruit training]]\n* [[Military science]]\n\n===Recruitment methods and campaigns===\n\n==== United States ====\n* [[Conscription in the United States]]\n* ''[[America's Army]]'' (recruitment game)\n* [[Slogans of the United States Army]]\n\n==== Other states ====\n* UK: [[Be All You Can Be]]\n* [[Canada First Defence Strategy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nManigart, Philippe.\n\"Risks and Recruitment in Postmodern Armed Forces: The Case of Belgium.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jul 2005; vol. 31: pp.&nbsp;559\u2013582.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/4/559\n\nDandeker, Christopher and Alan Strachan.\n\"Soldier Recruitment to the British Army: a Spatial and Social Methodology for Analysis and Monitoring.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 1993; vol. 19: pp.&nbsp;279\u2013290.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/2/279\n\nSnyder, William P.\n\"Officer Recruitment for the All-Volunteer Force: Trends and Prospects.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Apr 1984; vol. 10: pp.&nbsp;401\u2013425.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/401\n\nGriffith, James.\n\"Institutional Motives for Serving in the U.S. Army National Guard: Implications for Recruitment, Retention, and Readiness.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 2008; vol. 34: pp.&nbsp;230\u2013258.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/2/230\n\nFitzgerald, John A.\n\"Changing Patterns of Officer Recruitment at the U.S. Naval Academy.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Oct 1981; vol. 8: pp.&nbsp;111\u2013128.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/1/111\n\nEighmey, John.\n\"Why Do Youth Enlist?: Identification of Underlying Themes.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 2006; vol. 32: pp.&nbsp;307\u2013328.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/2/307\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Military Recruitment}}\n[[Category:Military recruitment| ]]\n[[Category:Recruitment]]\n[[Category:Military personnel]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|compulsory military service|Conscription}}\n[[File:Affiche recrutement Troupes de Marine.jpg|thumb|[[Troupes de Marine|French marines]] recruitement poster]]\n[[File:US Navy recruitment advert in Popular Mechanics 1908.png|thumb|[[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] recruitment advertisement in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', 1908.]]\n'''Military recruitment''' refers to the activity of attracting people to, and selecting them for, [[Recruit training|military training]] and [[Military service|employment]]<nowiki/>.\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n=== Gender ===\n{{Main|Women in the military by country}}{{See also|Women in the military|Transgender people and military service|Women in combat}}\nAcross the world, the large majority of recruits to state [[armed forces]] and [[Violent non-state actor|non-state armed groups]] are male.

A minimum standard of academic attainment may be required for entry, for certain technical roles, or for entry to train for a leadership position as a [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]]. Candidates who meet the criteria will normally also undergo [[Aptitude|aptitude test]], [[medical examination]], psychological interview, job interview and fitness assessment.\n\nDepending on whether the application criteria are met, and depending also on which military units have vacancies for new recruits, candidates may or may not be offered a job in a certain role or roles. Candidates who accept a job offer then wait for their [[recruit training]] to begin. Either at or before the start of their training, candidates swear or affirm an [[oath of allegiance]] and/or sign their joining papers.\n\nThe period between the initial application to swearing the oath may be several weeks or months. During this time many candidates drop out. For example, in 2017 about 1 in 20 applicants to the British Army were eventually enlisted.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, ref.

At other times, techniques similar to those outlined above have been used. The most prominent concern over the years has been the minimum age for recruitment, which has been 16 for many years.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/117504.stm | work=BBC News | title=Marching orders for teenage soldiers? | date=June 22, 1998 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> This has now been raised to 18 in relation to combat operations.

Today there are thousands of recruiting stations across the United States, serving the Army, Navy, Marines, and Air Force.  Recruiting offices normally consist of 2\u20138 recruiters between the ranks of E-5 and E-7.  When a potential applicant walks into a recruiting station his or her height and weight are checked and their background investigated.  A finger print scan is conducted and a practice ASVAB exam is given to them.  Applicants can not officially swear their enlistment oath in the recruiting office.  This is conducted at a Military Entrance Processing Station \u2013 MEPS.\n\n=== Wartime recruitment strategies in the US ===\n{{Further|Recruitment in the United States Military|Conscription in the United States}}\n[[File:Find the range of your patriotism2.jpg|thumb|[[United States Navy]] recruitment poster from 1918. Note the appeal to [[patriotism]]. (Digitally restored).]]\nPrior to the outbreak of World War I, military recruitment in the US was conducted primarily by individual states.<ref name=\"Padilla, Peter A 1953. Page 423\">Padilla, Peter A. and Mary Riege Laner. \u201cTrends in Military Influences on Army Recruitment: 1915-1953.\u201d Sociological Inquiry, Vol. 71, No. 4. Fall 2001421-36. Austin: University of Texas Press. Page 423</ref> Upon entering the war, however, the federal government took an increased role.\n\nThe increased emphasis on a national effort was reflected in World War I recruitment methods. Peter A. Padilla and Mary Riege Laner define six basic appeals to these recruitment campaigns: [[patriotism]], job/career/education, adventure/challenge, [[social status]], travel, and miscellaneous.  Between 1915 and 1918, 42% of all army recruitment posters were themed primarily by patriotism.<ref name=\"Padilla, Peter A 1953. Page 423\"/> And though other themes \u2013 such as adventure and greater social status \u2013 would play an increased role during World War II recruitment, appeals to serve one's country remained the dominant selling point.\n\n====Recruitment without conscription====\nIn the [[aftermath of World War II]] military recruitment shifted significantly. With no war calling men and women to duty, the United States refocused its recruitment efforts to present the military as a career option, and as a means of achieving a higher education. A majority \u2013 55% \u2013 of all recruitment posters would serve this end. And though peacetime would not last, factors such as the move to an all-volunteer military would ultimately keep career-oriented recruitment efforts in place.<ref>Padilla, Peter A. and Mary Riege Laner. \"Trends in Military Influences on Army Recruitment: 1915-1953.\" Sociological Inquiry, Vol. 71, No. 4. Fall 2001421-36. Austin: University of Texas Press. Page 433</ref>  The Defense Department turned to television syndication as a recruiting aid from 1957\u20131960 with a filmed show, ''[[Country Style, USA]]''.\n\nOn February 20, 1970, the [[Project VOLAR|President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force]] unanimously agreed that the United States would be best served by an all-volunteer military. In supporting this recommendation, the committee noted that recruitment efforts would have to be intensified, as new enlistees would need to be ''convinced'' rather than ''conscripted''. Much like the post-World War II era, these new campaigns put a stronger emphasis on job opportunity. As such, the committee recommended \"improved basic compensation and conditions of service, proficiency pay, and accelerated promotions for the highly skilled to make military career opportunities more attractive.\" These new directives were to be combined with \"an intensive recruiting effort.\"<ref>The Report of the President's Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1970. Page 18.</ref>   Finalized in mid-1973, the recruitment of a \"professional\" military was met with success. In 1975 and 1976, military enlistments exceeded expectations, with over 365,000 men and women entering the military. Though this may, in part, have been the result of a lack of civilian jobs during the recession, it nevertheless stands to underline the ways in which recruiting efforts responded to the circumstances of the time.<ref>Bliven, Bruce Jr. Volunteers, One and All. New York: Readers Digest Press, 1976. {{ISBN|0-88349-058-7}}</ref>\n\nIndeed, recommendations made by the President's Commission continue to work in present-day recruitment efforts. Understanding the need for greater individual incentive, the US military has re-packaged the benefits of the [[GI Bill]]. Though originally intended as compensation for service, the bill is now seen as a recruiting tool. Today, the GI Bill is \"no longer a reward for service rendered, but an inducement to serve and has become a significant part of recruiter's pitches.\"<ref>White, John B. Lieutenant Commander, US Naval Reserve, Ph. D. \"The GI Bill: Recruiting Bonus, Retention Onus.\" Military Review, July\u2013August 2004.</ref>\n\n====Recruiting methods====\n\nRecruitment can be conducted over the telephone with organized lists, through email campaigns and from face to face prospecting. While telephone prospecting is the most efficient, face to face prospecting is the most effective. Military recruiters often set up booths at amusement parks, sports stadiums and other attractions. In recent years social media has been more commonly used.\n\n====Controversy====\n{{Main|Counter-recruitment#Arguments surrounding recruitment}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Military recruitment}}\n[[Image:Floor area and war recruitment posters at Columbia Institute of War and Peace Studies.jpg|thumb|right|World War I recruitment posters featured as part of the decor at the [[Institute of War and Peace Studies]] at [[Columbia University]], as part of understanding the psychological forces behind recruiting efforts]]\n\n=== Related military articles ===\n* [[Military service]]\n* [[Women in the military]]\n* [[Children in the military]]\n* [[Transgender people and military service]]\n* [[Counter-recruitment]]\n* [[Conscription]] and [[Impressment]]\n* [[Recruit training]]\n* [[Military science]]\n\n===Recruitment methods and campaigns===\n\n==== United States ====\n* [[Conscription in the United States]]\n* ''[[America's Army]]'' (recruitment game)\n* [[Slogans of the United States Army]]\n\n==== Other states ====\n* UK: [[Be All You Can Be]]\n* [[Canada First Defence Strategy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nManigart, Philippe.\n\"Risks and Recruitment in Postmodern Armed Forces: The Case of Belgium.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jul 2005; vol. 31: pp.&nbsp;559\u2013582.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/31/4/559\n\nDandeker, Christopher and Alan Strachan.\n\"Soldier Recruitment to the British Army: a Spatial and Social Methodology for Analysis and Monitoring.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 1993; vol. 19: pp.&nbsp;279\u2013290.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/19/2/279\n\nSnyder, William P.\n\"Officer Recruitment for the All-Volunteer Force: Trends and Prospects.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Apr 1984; vol. 10: pp.&nbsp;401\u2013425.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/401\n\nGriffith, James.\n\"Institutional Motives for Serving in the U.S. Army National Guard: Implications for Recruitment, Retention, and Readiness.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 2008; vol. 34: pp.&nbsp;230\u2013258.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/34/2/230\n\nFitzgerald, John A.\n\"Changing Patterns of Officer Recruitment at the U.S. Naval Academy.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Oct 1981; vol. 8: pp.&nbsp;111\u2013128.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/1/111\n\nEighmey, John.\n\"Why Do Youth Enlist?: Identification of Underlying Themes.\"\n''Armed Forces & Society'', Jan 2006; vol. 32: pp.&nbsp;307\u2013328.\n* http://afs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/32/2/307\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Military Recruitment}}\n[[Category:Military recruitment| ]]\n[[Category:Recruitment]]\n[[Category:Military personnel]]\n", "name_user": "77.46.193.91", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSocio-economic background:One note about reasons found in the presented study from 2020.)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_recruitment"}
