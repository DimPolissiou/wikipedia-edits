One deformity is its mouth, which has only a narrow vertical opening. This makes blood parrots somewhat harder to feed and potentially vulnerable to malnutrition.<ref name=\"about\" />\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pair of blood parrot cichlids.jpg|thumb|A pair of blood parrot cichlids]]\nBlood parrots are often bright orange in coloration, but there are other colors that they can have naturally, such as red, yellow or gray. Other colors may be produced by [[Painted fish|dyeing]] the fish, which can shorten [[life expectancy]]. Some fish have been injected with a colored dye by the breeder. Another modification, generally considered inhumane by enthusiasts, involves cutting the tail while small which causes the fish to grow into a heart shape; these are usually sold under the name of \"heart parrots\". As the press has brought this practice to light, the majority of fish stockists will no longer sell these modified fish. Adult fish can grow to a length of 8 inches (20 centimeters) and reach an age of 10 to 15 years.<ref name=\"aquafriend\" />\nVarious breeds of blood parrots have been developed, such as the \"King Kong parrot\", which typically vary in color from red to yellow. They have fully functioning mouths with less of a nuchal deformity and grow larger. They are usually considered more valuable than the traditional blood parrots.      They are not controversial at all they are special wonderful and beautiful fish bloodparrot cichlids are a treasure and if there's any vulnerability in them we will fix it to improve their lives blood parrot cichlids are fun and love to play. as i said anyone disrespecting them should pay a 80,000-99000$ fine.\n\n==Genetic defects==\nAs a result of hybridization of the parent species, the fish have several anatomical deformities, including a [[beak]]-shaped [[mouth]] that cannot fully close, which they compensate for by crushing food with the [[throat]] [[muscle]]s,<ref name=\"aquafriend\" /> a deformed nuchal hump, and compressed vertebrae. Some commercial foods have been developed specifically to be easy for blood parrots to ingest, and recently some blood parrots have been selectively bred to be able to completely close their mouths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Blood parrots sometimes can have deformed [[swim bladder]]s, causing an awkward swimming pattern; and unusually large, and often deformed [[iris (anatomy)|irises]].<ref name=\"aquafriend\" /><ref name=\"creation\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aquariacentral.com/fishinfo/fresh/bparrot.shtml |title=Man's Best or Worst Creation? |publisher=Aqua Central |author=McEwan, Michael |accessdate=2006-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824030029/http://www.aquariacentral.com/fishinfo/fresh/bparrot.shtml |archivedate=2006-08-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Breeding==\n[[File:BloodParrot.jpg|thumb|A large blood parrot]]\nMale blood parrots generally are [[infertility|infertile]], but successful breeding has occurred.<ref name=\"aquafriend\" /> Normally, a female blood parrot lays [[egg (biology)|egg]]s on a hard surface, and both parents guard the eggs unless the brood develops [[fungus]], at which time the eggs will be consumed by either the parents or other fish.<ref name=\"aquafriend\" /> However, [[Fish farming|fish farms]] have begun introducing male blood parrots injected with a [[hormone]] to increase fertility.<ref name=\"aquafriend\" /> Most female blood parrots are fertile.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parrot Cichlids|url=http://www.parrotcichlids.com/|website=www.parrotcichlids.com|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Aquarium==\nBlood parrots are [[Hardiness (plants)|hardy]] and may be housed by enthusiasts singly, in [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]], or with complementary species under a variety of conditions. Sufficient lighting can be provided by a variety of [[compact fluorescent lamp]]s without the use of T5 or [[halide]] fixtures.

One deformity is its mouth, which has only a narrow vertical opening. This makes blood parrots somewhat harder to feed and potentially vulnerable to malnutrition.<ref name=\"about\" />\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Pair of blood parrot cichlids.jpg|thumb|A pair of blood parrot cichlids]]\nBlood parrots are often bright orange in coloration, but there are other colors that they can have naturally, such as red, yellow or gray. Other colors may be produced by [[Painted fish|dyeing]] the fish, which can shorten [[life expectancy]]. Some fish have been injected with a colored dye by the breeder. Another modification, generally considered inhumane by enthusiasts, involves cutting the tail while small which causes the fish to grow into a heart shape; these are usually sold under the name of \"heart parrots\". As the press has brought this practice to light, the majority of fish stockists will no longer sell these modified fish. Adult fish can grow to a length of 8 inches (20 centimeters) and reach an age of 10 to 15 years.<ref name=\"aquafriend\" />\nVarious breeds of blood parrots have been developed, such as the \"King Kong parrot\", which typically vary in color from red to yellow. They have fully functioning mouths with less of a nuchal deformity and grow larger. They are usually considered more valuable than the traditional blood parrots.\n\n==Genetic defects==\nAs a result of hybridization of the parent species, the fish have several anatomical deformities, including a [[beak]]-shaped [[mouth]] that cannot fully close, which they compensate for by crushing food with the [[throat]] [[muscle]]s,<ref name=\"aquafriend\" /> a deformed nuchal hump, and compressed vertebrae. Some commercial foods have been developed specifically to be easy for blood parrots to ingest, and recently some blood parrots have been selectively bred to be able to completely close their mouths.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Blood parrots sometimes can have deformed [[swim bladder]]s, causing an awkward swimming pattern; and unusually large, and often deformed [[iris (anatomy)|irises]].<ref name=\"aquafriend\" /><ref name=\"creation\">{{cite web |url=http://www.aquariacentral.com/fishinfo/fresh/bparrot.shtml |title=Man's Best or Worst Creation? |publisher=Aqua Central |author=McEwan, Michael |accessdate=2006-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824030029/http://www.aquariacentral.com/fishinfo/fresh/bparrot.shtml |archivedate=2006-08-24 }}</ref>\n\n==Breeding==\n[[File:BloodParrot.jpg|thumb|A large blood parrot]]\nMale blood parrots generally are [[infertility|infertile]], but successful breeding has occurred.<ref name=\"aquafriend\" /> Normally, a female blood parrot lays [[egg (biology)|egg]]s on a hard surface, and both parents guard the eggs unless the brood develops [[fungus]], at which time the eggs will be consumed by either the parents or other fish.<ref name=\"aquafriend\" /> However, [[Fish farming|fish farms]] have begun introducing male blood parrots injected with a [[hormone]] to increase fertility.<ref name=\"aquafriend\" /> Most female blood parrots are fertile.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parrot Cichlids|url=http://www.parrotcichlids.com/|website=www.parrotcichlids.com|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Aquarium==\nBlood parrots are [[Hardiness (plants)|hardy]] and may be housed by enthusiasts singly, in [[Shoaling and schooling|schools]], or with complementary species under a variety of conditions.

The call patterns resemble neither [[Blue whale|blue]] nor [[fin whale]]s, being much higher in frequency, shorter, and more frequent.<ref name=\"disc\" /> Blue whales usually vocalize at 10\u201339&nbsp;Hz,<ref name=Cornell/> fin whales at 20&nbsp;Hz.<ref name=\"newsci\" /> The 52-hertz calls of this whale are highly variable in their pattern of repetition, duration, and sequence, although they are easily identifiable due to their frequency and characteristic clustering.<ref name=\"whoitech\" /> The calls have deepened slightly to around 50 hertz since 1992, suggesting the whale has grown or matured.<ref name=\"whoitrack\" />\n\nThe track of the 52-hertz whale is unrelated to the presence or movement of other whale species.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> Its movements have been somewhat similar to that of blue whales, but its timing has been more like that of fin whales.<ref name=\"whoitech\" /> It is detected in the [[Pacific Ocean]] every year beginning in August\u2013December, and moves out of range of the [[hydrophone]]s in January\u2013February. It travels as far north as the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] and [[Kodiak Islands]], and as far south as the California coast, swimming between 30 and 70&nbsp;km each day. Its recorded distance traveled per season has ranged from a low of 708&nbsp;km to a high of 11,062&nbsp;km in 2002\u201303.<ref name=\"oceanus\" />\n\nScientists at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] have been unable to identify the species of the whale.

The fact that the whale has survived and apparently matured indicates it is probably healthy. Still, its unique call is the only one of its kind detected anywhere and there is only one such source per season.<ref name=\"oceanus\" /> Because of this, the animal has been called the loneliest whale in the world.<ref name=\"disc\" /><ref name=\"Willingham\" /><ref name=\"Anderson\" />\n\n== History ==\n[[File:52 hz whale map.svg|thumb|Approximate map of the 52-hertz whale's migration range]]\nThe 52-hertz whale was discovered by a team from the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]].

It is classified as a [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] Csa climate. Summer days are hot, ranging from {{convert|85|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|105|\u00b0F}}, but the nights turn pleasantly cool, almost always dropping below {{convert|70|\u00b0F}}. The Delta Breeze, a flow of cool marine air originating from the [[Pacific Ocean]] via [[San Francisco Bay]] and the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]], frequently provides relief in the evening. Winter temperatures generally reach between {{convert|45|\u00b0F}} and {{convert|65|\u00b0F}} in the afternoon; nights average at about {{convert|40|\u00b0F}}, but occasionally fall below freezing.\n\nAverage temperatures range from {{convert|46|\u00b0F}} in December and January to {{convert|75|\u00b0F}} in July and August. Thick ground fog called [[tule fog]] settles into Davis during late fall and winter. This fog can be dense with visibility nearly zero. As in other areas of northern California, the tule fog is a leading cause of road accidents in the winter season.\n\nMean rainfall per annum is about {{convert|20|inch}}. The bulk of rain occurs between about mid-November to mid-March, with typically no precipitation falling from mid-June to mid-September.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/1120/Average-Weather-in-Davis-California-United-States-Year-Round |title=Average Weather in Davis California, United States |publisher=Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc.|accessdate=February 15, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nRecord temperatures range from a high of {{convert|116|\u00b0F}} on July 17, 1925, to a low of {{convert|12|\u00b0F}} on December 11, 1932.<ref name=\"wrcc.dri.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca2294 |title=DAVIS 1 WSW, CALIFORNIA \u2013 Climate Summary |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |accessdate=June 19, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811223156/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca2294 |archivedate=August 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Davis, California (normals 1981-2010, records 1893-2016)\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 53.9\n|Feb high F = 60.1\n|Mar high F = 65.8\n|Apr high F = 72.5 \n|May high F = 81.2\n|Jun high F = 88.6\n|Jul high F = 93.4\n|Aug high F = 92.5\n|Sep high F = 88.9\n|Oct high F = 79.1\n|Nov high F = 64.5\n|Dec high F = 54.3\n|year high F = 74.6\n|Jan low F = 38.1\n|Feb low F = 40.8\n|Mar low F = 43.7\n|Apr low F = 46.3\n|May low F = 51.5\n|Jun low F = 55.9\n|Jul low F = 57.3\n|Aug low F = 56.1\n|Sep low F = 54.4 \n|Oct low F = 49.2\n|Nov low F = 42.5\n|Dec low F = 37.8\n|year low F = 47.8\n|Jan mean F = 46.0\n|Feb mean F = 50.4\n|Mar mean F = 54.7\n|Apr mean F = 59.4\n|May mean F = 66.4\n|Jun mean F = 72.2\n|Jul mean F = 75.4\n|Aug mean F = 74.3\n|Sep mean F = 71.7\n|Oct mean F = 64.2\n|Nov mean F = 53.5\n|Dec mean F = 46.1\n|year mean F = 61.2\n|Jan record high F = 88\n|Feb record high F = 90\n|Mar record high F = 92\n|Apr record high F = 98\n|May record high F = 108\n|Jun record high F = 115\n|Jul record high F = 116\n|Aug record high F = 114\n|Sep record high F = 112\n|Oct record high F = 104\n|Nov record high F = 90\n|Dec record high F = 88\n|year record high F = 116\n|Jan record low F = 16\n|Feb record low F = 21\n|Mar record low F = 26\n|Apr record low F = 25\n|May record low F = 32\n|Jun record low F = 34\n|Jul record low F = 37\n|Aug record low F = 37\n|Sep record low F = 35\n|Oct record low F = 26\n|Nov record low F = 20\n|Dec record low F = 12\n|year record low F = 12\n|Jan rain inch = 3.92\n|Feb rain inch = 3.87\n|Mar rain inch = 2.77\n|Apr rain inch = 1.17\n|May rain inch = 0.56\n|Jun rain inch = 0.20\n|Jul rain inch = 0\n|Aug rain inch = 0.05\n|Sep rain inch = 0.26\n|Oct rain inch = 0.90\n|Nov rain inch = 2.36\n|Dec rain inch = 3.54\t\n|year rain inch = 19.60\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain days = 12.6\n|Feb rain days = 10.7\n|Mar rain days = 8.7\n|Apr rain days = 4.9\n|May rain days = 3.0\n|Jun rain days = 1.1\n|Jul rain days = 0.1\n|Aug rain days = 0.3\n|Sep rain days = 1.3\n|Oct rain days = 3.5\n|Nov rain days = 8.1\n|Dec rain days = 11.7\n|year rain days = 66.0\n|unit rain days = 0.01 inch\n|source 1 = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/NORMAL_MLY/stations/GHCND:USC00042294/detail|title=DAVIS 2 WSW EXPERIMENTAL FARM, CA US USC00042294: Summary of Monthly Normals 1981-2010|website=NOAA Climate Data Online|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n|source 2 = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca2294|title=DAVIS 2 WSW EXPERIMENTAL FARM, CALIFORNIA -- Climate Summary|website=Western Regional Climate Center|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n|date=February 2019\n}}\n\n===Neighborhoods===\nDavis is internally divided by two freeways ([[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] and [[California State Route 113|State Route 113]]), a north\u2013south railroad (California Northern), an east\u2013west mainline (Union Pacific) and several major streets.

Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass which crosses [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]]. The project cost $14,000. The tunnel is 21&nbsp;inches (53&nbsp;cm) wide and 18&nbsp;inches (46&nbsp;cm) high.\n\nThe tunnel has created problems of its own. The toads originally refused to use the tunnel and so the tunnel was lit to encourage its use. The toads then died from the heat of the lamps inside the tunnel. Once through the tunnel, the toads also had to contend with birds who grew wise to the toad-producing hole in the ground.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Postmaster to resemble a toad town.\n\n=== Davis Food Coop ===\nThe [http://davisfood.coop/ Davis Food Coop] is a Davis institution. Founded in 1972, this cooperative is presently owned and operated by over 9,000 members and families of the Davis Community. The Coop is a full service supermarket that has championed organic, healthy eating in the community, sponsoring community events including summer programs for children, cooking classes, and many other activities.\n\n=== Davis Pride Run/Walk for Equality and Community Festival ===\nDavis Pride is an all-day, all-inclusive, family-friendly celebration event for members and supporters of the LGBTQ+ community. Davis Pride is a two-part large-scale fundraising event for the Davis Phoenix Coalition developed each year by a volunteer planning committee made of community members invested not only in the city of Davis but Yolo County and the LGBTQ+ community as a whole. The day starts off with the Run/Walk for Equality, a brisk 1K/5K/10K run/walk through the picturesque Davis renown greenbelts. After which is followed by the FREE Community Fair which includes the Pride Music Festival, vendor booths, exhibits, cultural presentations, delicious food booths, and many of your closest friends!\n\n==Education==\n\n===University of California===\n{{Main|University of California, Davis}}\n\nThe [[University of California, Davis]], or UC Davis, a campus of the [[University of California]], had a 2015 Fall enrollment of 36,104 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance|title=Fall enrollment at a glance|date=December 20, 2017|website=universityofcalifornia.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320232403/https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance|archivedate=March 20, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> UC Davis has a dominant influence on the social and cultural life of the town.\n\n===D-Q University===\n{{Main|D-Q University}}\n[[Image:D-q university entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance and mural at D-Q University]]\nAlso known as '''Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University''' and much smaller than UC Davis, D-Q University was a two-year institution located on Road 31 in [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]] 6.7 miles (11&nbsp;km) west of [[California State Route 113|State Route 113]]. This is just west of Davis near the [[Yolo County Airport]]. About four miles (6&nbsp;km) to the west, the Road 31 exit from [[Interstate 505 (California)|Interstate 505]] is marked with cryptic signage, \"DQU.\" The site is about 100 feet (30 m) above mean sea level (AMSL). NAD83 coordinates for the campus are {{Coord|38|34|02|N|121|53|12|W}}\n\nThe college closed in 2005. The curriculum was said to include heritage and traditional [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] ceremonies. The {{convert|643|acre|km2}} and 5 buildings were formerly a military reservation according to a [[National Park Service]] publication, ''Five Views.'' The full name of the school is included here so that readers can accurately identify the topic. According to some tribal members, use of the spelled-out name of the university can be offensive. People who want to be culturally respectful refer to the institution as ''D-Q University''. Tribal members in appropriate circumstances may use the full name.\n\n===Other colleges===\nAn off-campus branch of [[Sacramento City College]] is located in Davis. The satellite is located in West Village, an area built by UC Davis to house students and others affiliated with the university.\n\n===Public schools===\nDavis' public school system is administrated by the [[Davis Joint Unified School District]].\n\nThe city has nine public elementary schools (North Davis, Birch Lane, Pioneer Elementary, Patwin, Cesar Chavez, Robert E. Willett, Marguerite Montgomery, Fred T. Korematsu at Mace Ranch, and Fairfield Elementary (which is outside the city limits but opened in 1866 and is Davis Joint Unified School District's oldest public school)). Davis has one school for [[Alternative education|independent study]] (Davis School for Independent Study), three public [[Middle school|junior high schools]] (Ralph Waldo Emerson, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Junior High School|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], and Frances Harper), one main high school ([[Davis Senior High School (California)|Davis Senior High School]]), one [[Alternative school|alternative high school]] (Martin Luther King High School), and a small project based high school ([[Leonardo da Vinci High School]]). Cesar Chavez is a [[Language immersion|Spanish immersion]] school, with no English integration until the third grade. The junior high schools contain grades 7 through 9. Due to a decline in the school-age population in Davis, two of the elementary schools in south Davis may have their district boundaries changed, or magnet programs may be moved to equalize enrollment. Valley Oak was closed after the 2007\u201308 school year, and their campus was granted to Da Vinci High (which had formerly been located in the back of Davis Senior High's campus) and a special-ed preschool. On average, class size is about 25 students: 1 teacher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ed-data.org/district/Yolo/Davis-Joint-Unified|title=EdData - District Profile - Davis Joint Unified|website=ed-data.org|access-date=2018-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712052603/http://www.ed-data.org/district/Yolo/Davis-Joint-Unified|archive-date=July 12, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt one time, Chavez and Willett were incorporated together to provide elementary education K\u20136 to both English-speaking and Spanish immersion students in West Davis. C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez served grades K\u20133 and was called West Davis Elementary, and Robert E. Willett (named for a long-time teacher at the school, now deceased) served grades 4\u20136 and was known as West Davis Intermediate. Willett now serves K\u20136 English-speaking students, and Chavez supports the Spanish immersion program for K\u20136.\n\n===Private schools===\n* [[Peregrine School]] (Preschool and Elementary)\n* Merryhill School (K\u20138)\n* Saint James School (K\u20138)\n* Grace Valley Christian Academy (K\u20139)\n* [[Davis Waldorf School]] (Pre-K\u20138)\n*Davis Parent Nursery School-the second oldest co-op nursery school in California (pre-K)\n\n===Private post-secondary schools===\n*  [[OnSite Medical Service, Inc.]] (Emergency Medical Technician Training Center; CPR, First Aid Training Site for American Heart Association)<ref>http://www.onsitemedicalservice.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329060031/https://www.onsitemedicalservice.com/ |date=March 29, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{See also|List of University of California, Davis faculty|List of University of California, Davis alumni}}\n\nThese are some notable Davis residents, other than UC Davis faculty who were not previously from Davis.\n\n* [[Karin Argoud]], actress\n* [[Samuel G.

It is classified as a [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] Csa climate. Summer days are hot, ranging from {{convert|85|\u00b0F}} to {{convert|105|\u00b0F}}, but the nights turn pleasantly cool, almost always dropping below {{convert|70|\u00b0F}}. The Delta Breeze, a flow of cool marine air originating from the [[Pacific Ocean]] via [[San Francisco Bay]] and the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]], frequently provides relief in the evening. Winter temperatures generally reach between {{convert|45|\u00b0F}} and {{convert|65|\u00b0F}} in the afternoon; nights average at about {{convert|40|\u00b0F}}, but occasionally fall below freezing.\n\nAverage temperatures range from {{convert|46|\u00b0F}} in December and January to {{convert|75|\u00b0F}} in July and August. Thick ground fog called [[tule fog]] settles into Davis during late fall and winter. This fog can be dense with visibility nearly zero. As in other areas of northern California, the tule fog is a leading cause of road accidents in the winter season.\n\nMean rainfall per annum is about {{convert|20|inch}}. The bulk of rain occurs between about mid-November to mid-March, with typically no precipitation falling from mid-June to mid-September.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/1120/Average-Weather-in-Davis-California-United-States-Year-Round |title=Average Weather in Davis California, United States |publisher=Cedar Lake Ventures, Inc.|accessdate=February 15, 2019 }}</ref>\n\nRecord temperatures range from a high of {{convert|116|\u00b0F}} on July 17, 1925, to a low of {{convert|12|\u00b0F}} on December 11, 1932.<ref name=\"wrcc.dri.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca2294 |title=DAVIS 1 WSW, CALIFORNIA \u2013 Climate Summary |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |accessdate=June 19, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811223156/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca2294 |archivedate=August 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Davis, California (normals 1981-2010, records 1893-2016)\n|single line = Y\n|Jan high F = 53.9\n|Feb high F = 60.1\n|Mar high F = 65.8\n|Apr high F = 72.5 \n|May high F = 81.2\n|Jun high F = 88.6\n|Jul high F = 93.4\n|Aug high F = 92.5\n|Sep high F = 88.9\n|Oct high F = 79.1\n|Nov high F = 64.5\n|Dec high F = 54.3\n|year high F = 74.6\n|Jan low F = 38.1\n|Feb low F = 40.8\n|Mar low F = 43.7\n|Apr low F = 46.3\n|May low F = 51.5\n|Jun low F = 55.9\n|Jul low F = 57.3\n|Aug low F = 56.1\n|Sep low F = 54.4 \n|Oct low F = 49.2\n|Nov low F = 42.5\n|Dec low F = 37.8\n|year low F = 47.8\n|Jan mean F = 46.0\n|Feb mean F = 50.4\n|Mar mean F = 54.7\n|Apr mean F = 59.4\n|May mean F = 66.4\n|Jun mean F = 72.2\n|Jul mean F = 75.4\n|Aug mean F = 74.3\n|Sep mean F = 71.7\n|Oct mean F = 64.2\n|Nov mean F = 53.5\n|Dec mean F = 46.1\n|year mean F = 61.2\n|Jan record high F = 88\n|Feb record high F = 90\n|Mar record high F = 92\n|Apr record high F = 98\n|May record high F = 108\n|Jun record high F = 115\n|Jul record high F = 116\n|Aug record high F = 114\n|Sep record high F = 112\n|Oct record high F = 104\n|Nov record high F = 90\n|Dec record high F = 88\n|year record high F = 116\n|Jan record low F = 16\n|Feb record low F = 21\n|Mar record low F = 26\n|Apr record low F = 25\n|May record low F = 32\n|Jun record low F = 34\n|Jul record low F = 37\n|Aug record low F = 37\n|Sep record low F = 35\n|Oct record low F = 26\n|Nov record low F = 20\n|Dec record low F = 12\n|year record low F = 12\n|Jan rain inch = 3.92\n|Feb rain inch = 3.87\n|Mar rain inch = 2.77\n|Apr rain inch = 1.17\n|May rain inch = 0.56\n|Jun rain inch = 0.20\n|Jul rain inch = 0\n|Aug rain inch = 0.05\n|Sep rain inch = 0.26\n|Oct rain inch = 0.90\n|Nov rain inch = 2.36\n|Dec rain inch = 3.54\t\n|year rain inch = 19.60\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain days = 12.6\n|Feb rain days = 10.7\n|Mar rain days = 8.7\n|Apr rain days = 4.9\n|May rain days = 3.0\n|Jun rain days = 1.1\n|Jul rain days = 0.1\n|Aug rain days = 0.3\n|Sep rain days = 1.3\n|Oct rain days = 3.5\n|Nov rain days = 8.1\n|Dec rain days = 11.7\n|year rain days = 66.0\n|unit rain days = 0.01 inch\n|source 1 = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datasets/NORMAL_MLY/stations/GHCND:USC00042294/detail|title=DAVIS 2 WSW EXPERIMENTAL FARM, CA US USC00042294: Summary of Monthly Normals 1981-2010|website=NOAA Climate Data Online|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n|source 2 = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca2294|title=DAVIS 2 WSW EXPERIMENTAL FARM, CALIFORNIA -- Climate Summary|website=Western Regional Climate Center|accessdate=February 15, 2019}}</ref>\n|date=February 2019\n}}\n\n===Neighborhoods===\nDavis is internally divided by two freeways ([[Interstate 80 in California|Interstate 80]] and [[California State Route 113|State Route 113]]), a north\u2013south railroad (California Northern), an east\u2013west mainline (Union Pacific) and several major streets.

Because of the building of an overpass, animal lovers worried about toads being killed by cars commuting from South Davis to North Davis, since the toads hopped from one side of a dirt lot (which the overpass replaced) to the reservoir at the other end. After much controversy, a decision was made to build a toad tunnel, which runs beneath the Pole Line Road overpass which crosses [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]]. The project cost $14,000. The tunnel is 21&nbsp;inches (53&nbsp;cm) wide and 18&nbsp;inches (46&nbsp;cm) high.\n\nThe tunnel has created problems of its own. The toads originally refused to use the tunnel and so the tunnel was lit to encourage its use. The toads then died from the heat of the lamps inside the tunnel. Once through the tunnel, the toads also had to contend with birds who grew wise to the toad-producing hole in the ground.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The exit to the toad tunnel has been decorated by the Postmaster to resemble a toad town.\n\n=== Davis Food Coop ===\nThe [http://davisfood.coop/ Davis Food Coop] is a Davis institution. Founded in 1972, this cooperative is presently owned and operated by over 9,000 members and families of the Davis Community. The Coop is a full service supermarket that has championed organic, healthy eating in the community, sponsoring community events including summer programs for children, cooking classes, and many other activities.\n\n=== Davis Pride Run/Walk for Equality and Community Festival ===\nDavis Pride is an all-day, all-inclusive, family-friendly celebration event for members and supporters of the LGBTQ+ community. Davis Pride is a two-part large-scale fundraising event for the Davis Phoenix Coalition developed each year by a volunteer planning committee made of community members invested not only in the city of Davis but Yolo County and the LGBTQ+ community as a whole. The day starts off with the Run/Walk for Equality, a brisk 1K/5K/10K run/walk through the picturesque Davis renown greenbelts. After which is followed by the FREE Community Fair which includes the Pride Music Festival, vendor booths, exhibits, cultural presentations, delicious food booths, and many of your closest friends!\n\n==Education==\n\n===University of California===\n{{Main|University of California, Davis}}\n\nThe [[University of California, Davis]], or UC Davis, a campus of the [[University of California]], had a 2015 Fall enrollment of 36,104 students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance|title=Fall enrollment at a glance|date=December 20, 2017|website=universityofcalifornia.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320232403/https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/fall-enrollment-glance|archivedate=March 20, 2018|df=mdy-all}}</ref> UC Davis has a dominant influence on the social and cultural life of the town.\n\n===D-Q University===\n{{Main|D-Q University}}\n[[Image:D-q university entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance and mural at D-Q University]]\nAlso known as '''Deganawidah-Quetzalcoatl University''' and much smaller than UC Davis, D-Q University was a two-year institution located on Road 31 in [[Yolo County, California|Yolo County]] 6.7 miles (11&nbsp;km) west of [[California State Route 113|State Route 113]]. This is just west of Davis near the [[Yolo County Airport]]. About four miles (6&nbsp;km) to the west, the Road 31 exit from [[Interstate 505 (California)|Interstate 505]] is marked with cryptic signage, \"DQU.\" The site is about 100 feet (30 m) above mean sea level (AMSL). NAD83 coordinates for the campus are {{Coord|38|34|02|N|121|53|12|W}}\n\nThe college closed in 2005. The curriculum was said to include heritage and traditional [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] ceremonies. The {{convert|643|acre|km2}} and 5 buildings were formerly a military reservation according to a [[National Park Service]] publication, ''Five Views.'' The full name of the school is included here so that readers can accurately identify the topic. According to some tribal members, use of the spelled-out name of the university can be offensive. People who want to be culturally respectful refer to the institution as ''D-Q University''. Tribal members in appropriate circumstances may use the full name.\n\n===Other colleges===\nAn off-campus branch of [[Sacramento City College]] is located in Davis. The satellite is located in West Village, an area built by UC Davis to house students and others affiliated with the university.\n\n===Public schools===\nDavis' public school system is administrated by the [[Davis Joint Unified School District]].\n\nThe city has nine public elementary schools (North Davis, Birch Lane, Pioneer Elementary, Patwin, Cesar Chavez, Robert E. Willett, Marguerite Montgomery, Fred T. Korematsu at Mace Ranch, and Fairfield Elementary (which is outside the city limits but opened in 1866 and is Davis Joint Unified School District's oldest public school)). Davis has one school for [[Alternative education|independent study]] (Davis School for Independent Study), three public [[Middle school|junior high schools]] (Ralph Waldo Emerson, [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Junior High School|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], and Frances Harper), one main high school ([[Davis Senior High School (California)|Davis Senior High School]]), one [[Alternative school|alternative high school]] (Martin Luther King High School), and a small technology-based high school ([[Leonardo da Vinci High School]]). Cesar Chavez is a [[Language immersion|Spanish immersion]] school, with no English integration until the third grade. The junior high schools contain grades 7 through 9. Due to a decline in the school-age population in Davis, two of the elementary schools in south Davis may have their district boundaries changed, or magnet programs may be moved to equalize enrollment. Valley Oak was closed after the 2007\u201308 school year, and their campus was granted to Da Vinci High (which had formerly been located in the back of Davis Senior High's campus) and a special-ed preschool. On average, class size is about 25 students: 1 teacher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ed-data.org/district/Yolo/Davis-Joint-Unified|title=EdData - District Profile - Davis Joint Unified|website=ed-data.org|access-date=2018-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180712052603/http://www.ed-data.org/district/Yolo/Davis-Joint-Unified|archive-date=July 12, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nAt one time, Chavez and Willett were incorporated together to provide elementary education K\u20136 to both English-speaking and Spanish immersion students in West Davis. C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez served grades K\u20133 and was called West Davis Elementary, and Robert E. Willett (named for a long-time teacher at the school, now deceased) served grades 4\u20136 and was known as West Davis Intermediate. Willett now serves K\u20136 English-speaking students, and Chavez supports the Spanish immersion program for K\u20136.\n\n===Private schools===\n* [[Peregrine School]] (Preschool and Elementary)\n* Merryhill School (K\u20138)\n* Saint James School (K\u20138)\n* Grace Valley Christian Academy (K\u20139)\n* [[Davis Waldorf School]] (Pre-K\u20138)\n*Davis Parent Nursery School-the second oldest co-op nursery school in California (pre-K)\n\n===Private post-secondary schools===\n*  [[OnSite Medical Service, Inc.]] (Emergency Medical Technician Training Center; CPR, First Aid Training Site for American Heart Association)<ref>http://www.onsitemedicalservice.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329060031/https://www.onsitemedicalservice.com/ |date=March 29, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n==Notable people==\n{{See also|List of University of California, Davis faculty|List of University of California, Davis alumni}}\n\nThese are some notable Davis residents, other than UC Davis faculty who were not previously from Davis.\n\n* [[Karin Argoud]], actress\n* [[Samuel G.

It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the \"Western Wall\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Complete visual compendium of Western Wall|url=https://madainproject.com/western_wall_(temple_mount)|website=Madain Project|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the [[Second Jewish Temple]] begun by [[Herod the Great]], which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the [[Temple Mount]], in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshippers and visitors. \n\nIn one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[night journey|Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].\n\nThe Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone]], the holiest site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by [[Herod the Great|Herod]], who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills in order to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved platform which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount platform.\n\nJust over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\n\nThe term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the \"Wailing Wall\", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324\u2013638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term \"Wailing Wall\" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term \"Wailing Wall\" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name=\"Halkin01\">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, \"Western Wall\" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft}}-long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of a {{convert|8|m|ft}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the \"Western Wall\" or \"Wailing Wall\", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the \"Little Western Wall\". In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.\n\nWhilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as \"the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion.\" On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name=\"Reiter2017\">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel\u2013Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.\n\nThe earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 17th century.<ref name=\"Goren\">{{cite book |first= Amnon |last= Ramon  |title= Delicate balances at the Temple Mount, 1967-1999  |work= Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |editors= Marshall J.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the [[Six-Day War]]. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the [[Moroccan Quarter]] was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1984}} \"One of the best documented endowments, one that embraced the entire quarter of Western Muslims or Maghrebis\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Jerusalem Western Wall stones.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Herodian ashlars of the Western Wall]]\n\n==Etymology==\n===Western Wall===\nEarly Jewish texts referred to a \"western wall of the Temple\",<ref name=SSR>[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]], ch. 2\u20138</ref> but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today \"the Western Wall\", or to the western wall of the actual Temple.<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/> The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term \"ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi\", \"the Western Wall\", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]].<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/>\n\n===Wailing Wall===\nThe name \"Wailing Wall\", and descriptions such as \"wailing place\", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century.<ref>\"Wailing Wall\" appears, for example, in J.J.

In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall.

It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the ''Even ha-shetiya'' or [[Foundation Stone]], which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]]. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,<ref>[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: \"Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone.\"; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: \"I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.\"</ref> some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.<ref>[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: \"In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.\"</ref> This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.\n\n===Part of the Temple proper===\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical [[King Solomon]] from the time of the [[First Temple]].<ref name=KHB>Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be\u2019aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004</ref>\n\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity.<ref>See Radvaz 692</ref> Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.<ref name=AH>{{cite book\n| last= Horovitz |first= Ahron |title= Jerusalem: Footsteps Through Time |year= 2001\n| publisher= [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]] |location= [[Jerusalem]] |chapter =\n| quote= However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.}}</ref>\n\n===Divine custody===\nA [[Midrash]] compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\",<ref name=SSR/> and [[Lamentations Rabbah]] mentions how [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref>\n\n===Divine Presence===\nAnother Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\",<ref>[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2</ref> and the [[Zohar]] similarly writes that \"the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall\".<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116</ref>\n\nEighteenth-century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\".<ref>''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4</ref> It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.<ref>See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.</ref>\n\n===Kabbalah of the word ''kotel''===\nRabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall.

These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall.<ref name=SLC/> Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long [[responsa]] appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper ''[[Israel Dov Frumkin#Havatzelet|Havatzelet]]'' in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration.<ref name=SLC/> More recently the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness.<ref name=YY>{{cite book\n| last= Yosef\n| first= Ovadia\n| authorlink= Ovadia Yosef\n| title= ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]''\n| year= 1990\n| location= [[Jerusalem]]\n| volume= 2, Laws of Kotel HaMa'aravi\n| pages= 278\u2013282\n| nopp= true\n}}</ref> Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a [[halachic]] point of view.

It is a relatively small segment of a far longer ancient retaining wall, known also in its entirety as the \"Western Wall\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Complete visual compendium of Western Wall|url=https://madainproject.com/western_wall_(temple_mount)|website=Madain Project|accessdate=28 March 2018}}</ref> The wall was originally erected as part of the expansion of the [[Second Jewish Temple]] begun by [[Herod the Great]], which resulted in the encasement of the natural, steep hill known to Jews and Christians as the [[Temple Mount]], in a huge rectangular structure topped by a flat platform, thus creating more space for the Temple itself, its auxiliary buildings, and crowds of worshippers and visitors. \n\nIn one of several varying Muslim traditions, it is the site where the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] tied his winged steed, al-[[Buraq]], on his [[night journey|Isra and Mi'raj]] to Jerusalem before ascending to paradise, and constitutes the eastern border of ''al-Haram al-Sharif'', the Noble Sanctuary of the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]].\n\nThe Western Wall's holiness in Judaism is a result of its proximity to the Temple Mount. Because of the [[Temple Mount entry restrictions]], the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the [[Foundation Stone]], the holiest site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it. The original, natural, and irregular-shaped Temple Mount was gradually extended to allow for an ever-larger [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] compound to be built at its top. This process was finalised by [[Herod the Great|Herod]], who enclosed the Mount with an almost rectangular set of retaining walls, built to support the Temple platform and using extensive substructures and earth fills in order to give the natural hill a geometrically regular shape. On top of this box-like structure Herod built a vast paved platform which surrounded the Temple. Of the four retaining walls, the western one is considered to be closest to the former [[Holy of Holies]], which makes it the most sacred site recognised by Judaism outside the former Temple Mount platform.\n\nJust over half the wall's total height, including its 17 [[course (architecture)|courses]] located below street level, dates from the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, and is commonly believed to have been built by Herod the Great starting in 19 BCE, although recent excavations indicate that the work was not finished by the time Herod died in 4 BCE. The very large stone blocks of the lower courses are Herodian, the courses of medium-sized stones above them were added during the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad period]], while the small stones of the uppermost courses are of more recent date, especially from the Ottoman period.\n\nThe term Western Wall and its variations are mostly used in a narrow sense for the section traditionally used by Jews for prayer; it has also been called the \"Wailing Wall\", referring to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of the Temples. During the period of [[Byzantine Empire|Christian Roman rule]] over Jerusalem (ca. 324\u2013638), Jews were completely barred from Jerusalem except to attend [[Tisha B'Av]], the day of national mourning for the Temples, and on this day the Jews would weep at their holy places. The term \"Wailing Wall\" was thus almost exclusively used by Christians, and was revived in the period of non-Jewish control between the establishment of [[Mandatory Palestine|British Rule]] in 1920 and the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. The term \"Wailing Wall\" is not used by religious Jews, and increasingly not by many others who consider it derogatory.<ref name=\"Halkin01\">{{harvnb|Halkin|2001}}</ref>\n\nIn a broader sense, \"Western Wall\" can refer to the entire {{convert|488|m|ft}}-long retaining wall on the western side of the Temple Mount. The classic portion now faces a large plaza in the Jewish Quarter, near the southwestern corner of the Temple Mount, while the rest of the wall is concealed behind structures in the [[Muslim Quarter]], with the small exception of a {{convert|8|m|ft}} section, the so-called [[Little Western Wall]]. The segment of the western retaining wall traditionally used for Jewish liturgy, known as the \"Western Wall\" or \"Wailing Wall\", derives its particular importance to it having never been fully obscured by medieval buildings, and displaying much more of the original Herodian [[stonework]] than the \"Little Western Wall\". In religious terms, the \"Little Western Wall\" is presumed to be even closer to the Holy of Holies and thus to the \"presence of God\" ([[Shechina]]), and the [[Western Wall Tunnel|underground]] [[Warren's Gate]], which has been out of reach for Jews from the 12th century till its partial excavation in the 20th century, even more so.\n\nWhilst the wall was considered Muslim property as an integral part of the [[Haram esh-Sharif]] and [[waqf]] property of the [[Moroccan Quarter]], a right of Jewish prayer and [[pilgrimage]] existed as part of the [[Status Quo (Jerusalem and Bethlehem)|Status Quo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Working Paper on the Holy Places|date=1949|author=UN Conciliation Commission |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_Nations_Conciliation_Commission_for_Palestine_Working_Paper_on_the_Holy_Places.djvu|pages=26|quote=The Palestine Administration interpreted the Status Quo in respect of the Wailing Wall as being that the Jewish Community had a right of access to the pavement in front of the Wall for their devotions, but that the Wall itself, the pavement in front of it and the adjacent Moroccan Quarter, were legally Moslem property. The Jews might bring to the Wall only those appurtenances of worship that were allowed under the Ottoman regime. This position was in general reaffirmed by the International Commission appointed by the British Government in 1930, with the approval of the Council of the League of Nations, to enquire into conflicting rights and claims concerning the Wailing Wall. The International Commission further ruled that although the Jews enjoyed no sort of proprietary rights to the Wall or the adjacent pavement, they should have free access to them at all times, subject to certain stipulations. The placing of benches and screens against the Wall was prohibited; the Moslems were similarly forbidden to carry out the Zikr ceremony during the progress of Jewish devotions or to cause annoyance to the Jews in any other way; no political speeches or demonstrations near the Wall were to be allowed; the Moslems' right to repair the pavement was affirmed, and if any repairs were not carried out by them in due time, the work was to be undertaken by the Government. The maintenance of the Wall itself was entrusted to the Government, but it was understood that repairs to it should be carried out only after consultation with the Supreme Moslem Council and the Chief Rabbinate.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Status Quo in the Holy Places|date=1929|first=L.

Some of the dwellings are entered from the space in front of the Wall. The wall separating the garden to the north from the Wailing Wall was rebuilt without incident in 1929. The wall overlooking the Wailing Wall by the Bab-al-Mughrabi was also rebuilt at the same time. The Moslems wanted to erect a low wall, but it was ruled, to preserve the Status Quo, that the wall must be rebuilt to its former height. The Wailing Wall, as being one of the few relics of the Temple of Herod of undisputed authenticity, is held in very great veneration by the Jews. Jewish writers refer to it as \"the Holiest possession of the fifteen millions of Jews throughout the world which they have not forgotten for one moment since the Dispersion.\" On Sabbaths and other Holy Days the Wall is thronged with worshippers, the American and European Jew mixing with the Orthodox Jew in his caftan and the Bokharan in his gorgeous silks. The Jewish custom of praying here is of considerable antiquity, being mentioned by Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela and has now become an established right. This right to pray has, however, become linked with the claim to the actual ownership of the Wall. The Moslems resist this on the ground that the Wall is an integral part of the enclosure wall of the Haram al Sharif, and that the space in front of it is a public way, and part of the premises of the Abu Midian Waqf. For this reason the Moslems have always protested against the placing of benches or chairs in front of the Wall by the Jews as causing an obstruction in this public way and implying possessory rights. Though benches have certainly from time to time been introduced, there is extant a resolution taken by the Administrative Council and confirmed by the Mutasarrif in 1912 that chairs or tents or curtains (to divide the women from the men) are not to be allowed. This is still enforced, but portable camp-stools or boxes or tins with cushions are permitted for the convenience of worshippers. This ruling was notified to the Jewish religious authorities and the Police by the District Governor in 1922, and confirmed in 1926 after a rather serious dispute had arisen on account of the introduction of some benches on the previous Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur).}}</ref><ref name=\"Reiter2017\">{{cite book |author=Yitzhak Reiter|title=Contested Holy Places in Israel\u2013Palestine: Sharing and Conflict Resolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieyfDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT26|date=7 April 2017|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-351-99884-0|pages=26\u2013}}</ref> This position was confirmed in a [[1930 Western Wall Commission|1930 international commission]] during the British Mandate period.\n\nThe earliest source mentioning this specific site as a place of Jewish worship is from the 17th century.<ref name=\"Goren\">{{cite book |first= Amnon |last= Ramon  |title= Delicate balances at the Temple Mount, 1967-1999  |work= Jerusalem: A City and Its Future |editors= Marshall J.

From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the [[Zionism|Zionist movement]] in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence at the foot of the wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly [[1929 Palestine riots|riot in 1929]] in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] the eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]], and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the [[Six-Day War]]. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site, the [[Moroccan Quarter]] was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.<ref>{{harvnb|Peters|1984}} \"One of the best documented endowments, one that embraced the entire quarter of Western Muslims or Maghrebis\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Jerusalem Western Wall stones.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Herodian ashlars of the Western Wall]]\n\n==Etymology==\n===Western Wall===\nEarly Jewish texts referred to a \"western wall of the Temple\",<ref name=SSR>[[Shir ha-Shirim Rabbah]], ch. 2\u20138</ref> but there is doubt whether the texts were referring to the outer, retaining wall called today \"the Western Wall\", or to the western wall of the actual Temple.<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/> The earliest Jewish use of the Hebrew term \"ha-kotel ha-ma'aravi\", \"the Western Wall\", as referring to the wall visible today, was by the 11th-century poet [[Ahimaaz ben Paltiel]].<ref name=\"Halkin01\"/>\n\n===Wailing Wall===\nThe name \"Wailing Wall\", and descriptions such as \"wailing place\", appeared regularly in English literature during the 19th century.<ref>\"Wailing Wall\" appears, for example, in J.J.

Around 19 BCE [[Herod the Great]] began a massive expansion project on the Temple Mount.

Today's Western Wall formed part of the retaining perimeter wall of this platform. In 2011, Israeli archaeologists announced the surprising discovery of Roman coins minted well after Herod's death, found under the foundation stones of the wall.

Also surprising was the fact that the usually very thorough Herodian builders had cut corners by filling in the ritual bath, rather than placing the foundation course directly onto the much firmer bedrock.

It has become a place of pilgrimage for Jews, as it is the closest permitted accessible site to the holiest spot in Judaism, namely the ''Even ha-shetiya'' or [[Foundation Stone]], which lies on the Temple Mount. According to one rabbinic opinion, Jews may not set foot upon the Temple Mount and doing so is a sin punishable by [[Kareth]]. While almost all historians and archaeologists and some rabbinical authorities believe that the rocky outcrop in the [[Dome of the Rock]] is the Foundation Stone,<ref>[[Radbaz]] [[Responsa]] 691: \"Under the [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] on the Temple Mount, which the Arabs call El-Sakhrah, without a doubt, is the location of the Foundation Stone.\"; Ya'ari, Avraham: ''Igrot Eretz Yisrael'' by [[Obadiah ben Abraham]], [[Ramat Gan]] 1971: \"I sought the place of the Foundation Stone where the [[Ark of the Covenant]] was placed, and many people told me it is under a tall and beautiful [[Dome of the Rock|dome]] which the Arabs built in the Temple precinct.\"</ref> some rabbis say it is located directly opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall, near the El-kas fountain.<ref>[[Moishe Sternbuch|Sternbuch, Moishe]] ''Teshuvos Ve-hanhagos'' Vol. 3, Ch. 39: \"In truth they have erred, thinking that the stone upon they built their dome was in fact the Foundation Stone, however, most possibly, the Stone is located further to the south in the open space opposite the exposed section of the Western Wall.\"</ref> This spot was the site of the [[Kodesh Hakodashim|Holy of Holies]] when the Temple stood.\n\n===Part of the Temple proper===\nRabbinic tradition teaches that the western wall was built upon foundations laid by the biblical [[King Solomon]] from the time of the [[First Temple]].<ref name=KHB>Frishman, Avraham; ''Kum Hisalech Be\u2019aretz'', [[Jerusalem]] 2004</ref>\n\nSome medieval rabbis claimed that today's Western Wall is a surviving wall of the Temple itself and cautioned Jews from approaching it, lest they enter the Temple precincts in a state of impurity.<ref>See Radvaz 692</ref> Many contemporary rabbis believe that the rabbinic traditions were made in reference to the Temple Mount's Western Wall, which accordingly endows the Wall with inherent holiness.<ref name=AH>{{cite book\n| last= Horovitz |first= Ahron |title= Jerusalem: Footsteps Through Time |year= 2001\n| publisher= [[Feldheim Publishers|Feldheim]] |location= [[Jerusalem]] |chapter =\n| quote= However, today there is no doubt that the wall is the western retaining wall of the Temple Mount and the Midrash refers to the Temple in its broader sense, that is, the Temple Mount.}}</ref>\n\n===Divine custody===\nA [[Midrash]] compiled in [[Late Antiquity]] refers to a western wall of the Temple which \"would never be destroyed\",<ref name=SSR/> and [[Lamentations Rabbah]] mentions how [[Roman Empire|Rome]] was unable to topple the western wall due to the Divine oath promising its eternal survival.<ref>[[Lamentations Rabbah]] 1:32</ref>\n\n===Divine Presence===\nAnother Midrash quotes a 4th-century scholar: \"Rav Acha said that the Divine Presence has never departed from the Western Wall\",<ref>[[Exodus Rabbah]] 2:2</ref> and the [[Zohar]] similarly writes that \"the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] rests upon the Western Wall\".<ref>[[Zohar]] [[Mishpatim]] 116</ref>\n\nEighteenth-century scholar [[Jonathan Eybeschutz]] writes that \"after the destruction of the Temple, God removed His Presence from His sanctuary and placed it upon the Western Wall where it remains in its holiness and honour\".<ref>''[[Jonathan Eybeschutz#Works|Ya'arot Devash]]'' Vol. 1, Ch. 4</ref> It is told that great Jewish sages, including [[Isaac Luria]] and the [[Radvaz]], experienced a revelation of the Divine Presence at the wall.<ref>See also ''[[Kav ha-Yashar]]'' Ch. 93 and ''[[Chaim Joseph David Azulai#His Shem ha-Gedolim|Shem Ha-gedolim]]'' for a similar account with Rabbi Avraham Ha-levi of Safed.</ref>\n\n===Kabbalah of the word ''kotel''===\nRabbi [[Zvi Hirsch Kaindenover]] discusses the mystical aspect of the Hebrew word ''kotel'' when discussing the significance of praying against a wall.

These practices stopped after rabbis determined that such actions compromised the sanctity of the Wall.<ref name=SLC/> Another practice also existed whereby pilgrims or those intending to travel abroad would hack off a chip from the Wall or take some of the sand from between its cracks as a good luck charm or memento. In the late 19th century the question was raised as to whether this was permitted and a long [[responsa]] appeared in the Jerusalem newspaper ''[[Israel Dov Frumkin#Havatzelet|Havatzelet]]'' in 1898. It concluded that even if according to Jewish Law it was permitted, the practices should be stopped as it constituted a desecration.<ref name=SLC/> More recently the ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]'' rules that it is forbidden to remove small chips of stone or dust from the Wall, although it is permissible to take twigs from the vegetation which grows in the Wall for an amulet, as they contain no holiness.<ref name=YY>{{cite book\n| last= Yosef\n| first= Ovadia\n| authorlink= Ovadia Yosef\n| title= ''[[Yalkut Yosef]]''\n| year= 1990\n| location= [[Jerusalem]]\n| volume= 2, Laws of Kotel HaMa'aravi\n| pages= 278\u2013282\n| nopp= true\n}}</ref> Cleaning the stones is also problematic from a [[halachic]] point of view.

Founded in 2004, the school is a member of the [[San Dieguito Union High School District]], and is located in [[Carmel Valley, San Diego, California|Carmel Valley]], a residential suburb of San Diego.\n\n==History==\nDuring the first school year (2004\u201305) at CCA, only first-year students were admitted into the student body, with a new class being added with each subsequent year. As a result, a complete student body did not exist on campus until the fourth year of instruction (2007\u201308), when the first class were in their final year. During the first school year, the students were instructed in portable trailers located in the school's parking lot. All facilities were open and construction of the original buildings was completed by the end of the second school year (2005\u201306). The overall cost of building the campus amounted to $103 million.<ref name=UnionTribune>{{cite news|last=Saavedra |first=Sherry |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060930/news_1mi30canyon.html |title=The future of learning: High-tech campus offers art, tech gear industry pros envy |newspaper=San Diego Union Tribune|date=September 30, 2006}}</ref> Until 2014, a lottery was held to determine admission to the school, as the number of students who wished to attend exceeded the school's maximum enrollment. A new building, the B building, was added in early 2016, and was opened by August 2017, to alleviate the capacity issues.\n\nThe first group of students chose the raven as the school's mascot.\n\n== Curriculum ==\nCCA follows a semester class schedule instead of a traditional year-based schedule, which means that students can complete eight classes in a year (four in the fall term and four in the spring term), rather than six year-long courses. The current student to teacher ratio is roughly 34:1.\n\nCCA's science department runs QUEST, a program designed to allow students to learn science as it is applicable in the real world and conduct independent research. Students in the program progress through three tiers: Research Methods, Applied Sciences, and Internship. A similar class, Advanced Engineering and Technology, provides opportunities primarily focused on STEM areas of research.\n\n[[Organic chemistry]], including mechanisms, reactions, and biochemistry was started in the 2017-18 school year for the fall term. As of the 2019-2020 school year, biochemistry was removed from the course curriculum.<ref name=\"Organic Chemistry at CCA\">{{cite web |last1=Sevilla |first1=Kristin |title=Organic Chemistry at CCA|url=https://sites.google.com/a/sduhsd.net/mrssevilla/class |website=Organic Chemistry |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\nCCA offers an arts and technology program called Envision.

As a result, a complete student body did not exist on campus until the fourth year of instruction (2007\u201308), when the first class were in their final year. During the first school year, the students were instructed in portable trailers located in the school's parking lot. All facilities were open and construction of the original buildings was completed by the end of the second school year (2005\u201306). The overall cost of building the campus amounted to $103 million.<ref name=UnionTribune>{{cite news|last=Saavedra |first=Sherry |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060930/news_1mi30canyon.html |title=The future of learning: High-tech campus offers art, tech gear industry pros envy |newspaper=San Diego Union Tribune|date=September 30, 2006}}</ref> Until 2014, a lottery was held to determine admission to the school, as the number of students who wished to attend exceeded the school's maximum enrollment. A new building, the B building, was added in early 2016, and was opened by August 2017, to alleviate the capacity issues.\n\nThe first group of students chose the raven as the school's mascot.\n\n== Curriculum ==\nCCA follows a semester class schedule instead of a traditional year-based schedule, which means that students can complete eight classes in a year (four in the fall term and four in the spring term), rather than six year-long courses.  The current student to teacher ratio is roughly 34:1.\n\nCCA's science department runs QUEST, a program designed to allow students to learn science as it is applicable in the real world and conduct independent research. Students in the program progress through three tiers: Research Methods, Applied Sciences, and Internship. A similar class, Advanced Engineering and Technology, provides opportunities primarily focused on STEM areas of research.\n\n[[Organic chemistry]], including mechanisms, reactions, and biochemistry was started in the 2017-18 school year for the fall term.
