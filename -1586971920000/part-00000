{"title_page": "Pursuit of Nazi collaborators", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=June 2013}}\n{{Cleanup rewrite|many of the \"sentences\" are only phrases|date=December 2016}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2013}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2013}}\n\nThe '''pursuit of Nazi collaborators''' refers to the post-World War II pursuit and apprehension of individuals who were not citizens of the [[Third Reich]] at the outbreak of [[World War II]] but [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborated]] with the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime during the war. Hence, this article does not cover former members of the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] and their fate after the war.\n\n== Background ==\nThere were a number of motives for the apprehension of suspected collaborators.  The main motives were: revenge for those murdered, especially those murdered on ethnic grounds in the Holocaust (principally among [[Jew]]s, [[Poles]], and [[Russians]]); a desire after the war to see those responsible face justice, and be categorised as criminals by a court of law (See [[Nuremberg Trials]]); a means of ensuring that criminal acts done were brought to light and placed on the official record, with evidence, so that they could never be disproven (some of the acts being so unthinkable that [[Holocaust denial|denial]] was plausible); widespread sense that genocide of whole communities and cultures on such a scale was intolerable and must not be left unprosecuted even despite the inadequacy of existing laws; and fear that a \"Nazi underground\" of some kind existed, such as the mythical [[ODESSA]], which could allow the enemy to somehow regroup for their proclaimed [[Fourth Reich]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== Means of pursuit ==\nThe pursuit took many forms, both individual and organised. Several organisations and individuals (famous [[Nazi hunter]]s) pursued [[ex-Nazi]]s or Nazi [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] who allegedly engaged in [[war crimes]] or [[crimes against humanity]]. The pursuit took varied forms such as individuals who reported they saw someone who they recognised, who had now assumed a false identity intent on slipping back into civilian life undetected. Specific individuals were named and sought by groups or governments for their crimes during the war.\n\nOthers were subject to after-war spontaneous retaliation committed by populations within occupied countries, which in some areas led to \"[[witch hunts]]\" for those suspected of having been collaborators, where vigilantism and \"summary justice\", were common. After a first period of spontaneous pursuit, provisional governments took the matter into their own hands and brought suspected criminals to court. The Nuremberg Trial in Germany judged only the highest German Nazi authorities, and each country prosecuted and sentenced their own collaborationists. [[Pierre Laval]] in France was judged and sentenced to death, while [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] was also sentenced to death, but [[Charles de Gaulle]] later commuted his sentence into a life condemnation. Government action took the form of investigation and interrogation of people suspected of collaboration. An example of such action was the [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|U.S. DOJ Office of Special Investigations]].\n\nInfiltration of Nazi support and escape organisations (the most famous one being the [[ODESSA]] network and its various \"[[Ratlines (history)|ratlines]]\") and those believed to be aiding and abetting them. However, many suspected war criminals were also given [[amnesty]], and some reached high positions in post-war administrations (e.g. [[Maurice Papon]], who became [[Pr\u00e9fecture de police|Police Prefect of Paris]] in charge during the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362); he was blamed for the [[1961 Paris massacre]]). Others were never even tried such as [[Robert de Foy]] who resumed being head of the [[Belgian State Security Service]] 1945-1958.\n\n== Pursuit in specific countries ==\n=== Argentina ===\nIn 1960 [[Adolf Eichmann]] was captured by Mossad agents in Argentina and smuggled into Israel. Eichmann provided a location in Argentina where [[Josef Mengele]] had been but Mossad was unable to find him; by 1961 Mengele had moved to Brazil. In early October 1999, [[Nazi hunter]] [[Efraim Zuroff]] tracked [[Usta\u0161e|Ustasha]] [[Dinko \u0160aki\u0107]], the former commandant of [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] (nicknamed the \"Auschwitz of the Balkans\"). Sakic had lived in Argentina for more than 50 years. He was extradited to [[Croatia]] and sentenced by a Zagreb court to 20 years' imprisonment for his crimes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22509603-5006789,00.html |title=Testimony 'clears' Zentai's name |date=1 October 2007 |author=Paige Taylor |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Australia ===\nLatvia applied to Australia to extradite [[Konrads Kalejs]], allegedly a senior officer in the pro-Nazi [[Arajs Commando]], but he died on 8 November 2001 before he could be extradited. Kalejs migrated to Australia in 1950 and took citizenship. [[Hungary]] applied for the extradition of [[Charles Zentai]] from Australia. He was accused of the murder of Peter Balazs, an 18-year-old [[Judaism|Jewish]] man, in [[Budapest]] in November 1944, while serving in the [[Military of Hungary#Mid-twentieth century|Hungarian Army]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/08/secondworldwar.argentina |title=The hunt for Doctor Death |first1=Rory |last1=Carroll |first2=Uki |last2=Go\u00f1i |date=8 January 2008 |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n=== Belgium ===\n[[Belgium]] imprisoned Belgian nationals who had collaborated with the Nazis and executed some. One Belgian to be sentenced to execution was [[Pierre Daye]], however he was one of the first Nazi collaborators to escape Europe, and unusually by plane. He fled to Argentina with the help of [[Charles Lescat]], also collaborator of ''[[Je suis partout]]''.<ref name=extradiciones>{{cite web|url=http://www.argentina-rree.com/portal/archivos/justicia01.htm|title=Introducci\u00f3n|work=argentina-rree.com}}</ref> Once in Argentina he attended a meeting organised by [[Juan Per\u00f3n]] in the ''[[Casa Rosada]]'' during which a network (colloquially called [[ratlines (history)|ratlines]]) was created, to organise the escape of collaborators and former Nazis.<ref name=PaginaUki>{{cite web|url=http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-14198-2002-12-15.html|title=La Odessa que cre\u00f3 Per\u00f3n|publisher= [[Pagina/12]]|date= 15 December 2002|language= Spanish}}</ref> On 17 June 1947, Belgium requested his [[extradition]] from Argentina, however the Argentine Government ignored this request.

Immediately after the liberation of Czechoslovakia by [[Red Army|Soviet]] and American armies, in an atmosphere of chaos, wild chases began. Individual acts of revenge, mob violence, and simply criminal acts motivated by the possibility to rob or loot targets, occurred. In some places were conducted, by organised groups of self-styled [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s, violence which resembled what is today known as [[ethnic cleansing]]. In most places this stopped when the provisional Czech government and local authorities took power. Other forms included legal action, undertaken by the state administration, after the war, until the regular Czech parliament was established. [[Edvard Bene\u0161|President Bene\u0161]] ruled by issuing [[Talk:Bene\u0161 decrees|decrees]], which were later ratified by parliament.\n\nBy decree ''5/1945'', property of untrustworthy persons was put under national administration. Untrustworthy were considered German and Hungarian nationals, and people who were active in destruction of the Czechoslovak state and its democratic government, supported Nazi occupation by any means, or were members of organisations considered fascist or collaborator. By the same decree, property of people of German and Hungarian nationality, who could prove they were anti-Nazi, could be returned to them.\n\nBy decree ''12/1945 Sb.'', farm property of German and Hungarian nationals or citizens was confiscated, unless they could prove active resistance against Nazism. Property of ''traitors, and enemies of the republic'' was confiscated, regardless of nationality or citizenship. By decree ''16/1945 Sb.'', special tribunals were started. These people's courts had right to sentence to long term imprisonment, life sentence or death. Prosecutions varied from verbal support to those who had committed crimes against humanity, no prosecution was based on ethnicity. By ''33/1945 Sb.'' people of German and Hungarian nationality or ethnicity lost their Czechoslovakian citizenship. However, they had right to apply for renewal.\n\nMost problematic was the law ''115/1946'', concerning resistance to the Nazi regime, which shifted limit of immunity to the year 1946, effectively amnestying all crimes, acts of individual revenge and atrocities against Germans and Hungarians long after the war.\n\nPeople who lost Czechoslovakian citizenship and failed to apply or did not get it were [[population transfer|transferred]] to Germany, many through the [[transfer camp]] established at [[Terez\u00edn]], near the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].\n\n=== Estonia ===\nIn the [[Estonian war crimes trials]] of 1961 and 1962, several collaborators were sentenced for participation in the [[Holocaust in Estonia|Estonian holocaust]]. Many of the accused escaped punishment by escaping into exile or by suicide. The infamous [[Karl Linnas]] was finally deported by the United States and died in Leningrad while awaiting retrial.\n\n=== France ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\n\n{{Further|Epuration l\u00e9gale}}\n[[File:Laval-shot0038.png|thumb|left|[[Pierre Laval]] and [[Philippe P\u00e9tain|P\u00e9tain]] in the [[Frank Capra]] documentary film ''[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]'' (1943)]]\n\nAfter the liberation, France was briefly swept by a wave of executions of suspected collaborators. Women who were suspected of having romantic liaisons with Germans were publicly humiliated by having their heads shaved. Those who had engaged in the [[black market]] were also stigmatised as \"[[war profiteer]]s\" (''profiteurs de guerre''). However, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF, 1944\u201346) quickly reestablished order and brought collaborators before the courts. Many of the convicted were later granted [[amnesty]] under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] (1946\u20131954), while some prominent civil servants, such as [[Maurice Papon]], escaped prosecution altogether and succeeded in holding important positions even under [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] (1958 and afterward).\n\nThree periods are identified by historians:{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}<!-- Which historians examples needed -->\nThe first phase (''\u00e9puration sauvage'') consisted of popular convictions, summary executions, and the shaving of women's heads. Estimates by [[Pr\u00e9fecture de police|police prefects]] made in 1948 and 1952 were that as many as six thousand executions occurred before the liberation of France, and four thousand thereafter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}<!-- source needed for specific numbers like these --> The second phase, ''[[\u00e9puration l\u00e9gale]]'' (legal purge), began on 26 and 27 June 1944 with Charles de Gaulle's ordinances on the judgment of collaborators by the ''commissions d'\u00e9puration''; the commissions sentenced approximately 120,000 persons. [[Charles Maurras]], the leader of the royalist ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'', was, for example, sentenced to life imprisonment on 25 January 1945. The third phase was more lenient towards collaborators; the trials of [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] and the writer, [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]] are examples of actions taken during this phase.\n\nBetween 1944 and 1951, official courts in France sentenced 6,763 people to death (3,910 in absentia) for treason and other offences, but only 791 executions were actually carried out. More common was [[D\u00e9gradation nationale|\"national degradation,\"]] a loss of face and civil rights, which was meted out to 49,723 people.<ref>Judt, Tony, Postwar: ''A History of Europe Since 1945'', Pimlico (London: 2007), p. 46.</ref>\n\nPhilippe P\u00e9tain, the former head of [[Vichy France]], was charged with treason in July 1945. He was convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad, but Charles de Gaulle commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. [[Pierre Laval]] was however, executed after his trial. Most convicts were given amnesty a few years later. In the police, collaborators soon resumed official responsibilities. For example, Maurice Papon, who would be convicted in the 1990s for his role in the Vichy collaborationist government, was in the position of giving orders for the [[Paris massacre of 1961]] as the head of the Parisian police.\n\nThe French members of the Waffen-SS [[SS Division Charlemagne|''Charlemagne'' Division]] who survived the war were regarded as traitors. Some of the more prominent officers were executed, while the rank-and-file were given prison terms; some of them were given the option of doing time in [[Indochina War|Indochina]] (1946\u201354) with the [[L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re|Foreign Legion]] instead of prison.\n\nMany war criminals were judged only in the 1980s, including [[Paul Touvier]], [[Klaus Barbie]], Maurice Papon and his deputy [[Jean Leguay]]. The last two were both convicted for their roles in the July 1942 ''Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv'', or [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]]). Famous [[Nazi hunter]]s [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld]] spent decades trying to bring them to justice. A fair number of collaborationists joined the [[Organisation de l'arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]] terrorist movement during the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362). [[Jacques de Bernonville]] escaped to Quebec, then Brazil. [[Jacques Ploncard d'Assac]] became counselor of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] in Portugal.\n\nReliable statistics of the death toll do not exist. At the low end, one estimate is that approximately 10,500 were executed, before and after liberation. \"The courts of Justice pronounced about 6,760 death sentences, 3,910 in absentia and 2,853 in the presence of the accused. Of these 2,853, 73 percent were commuted by de Gaulle, and 767 carried out. In addition, about 770 executions were ordered by the military tribunals. Thus the total number of people executed before and after the Liberation was approximately 10,500, including those killed in the \u00e9puration sauvage\"<ref>Jackson (2003), p. 577</ref>, notably including members and leaders of the [[Milice|milices]]. US forces put the put the number of \"summary executions\" following liberation at 80,000. The French Minister of the Interior at the time, March 1945, reported that the number executed was 105,000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=France: the tragic years, 1939-1947, an eyewitness account of war and occupation.|last=Huddleston, Sisley, 1883-1952.|date=[\u00a91955]|publisher=Devin-Adair|isbn=|location=|pages=299|oclc=1034908484}}</ref>\n\n=== Greece porn ===\n{{Pornhub.com}}\n\nGreece was under the control of the Third Reich from 1941 to 1944. After the liberation, the country followed a controversial period of [[denazification]]. Many collaborators and especially former leaders of the Nazi-held puppet regime in Athens were sentenced to death. General [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]], the first collaborationist prime minister, was tried by the Greek Special Collaborators Court in 1945 and sentenced to death, but his penalty, like most death sentences, was commuted to life imprisonment. The second collaborationist leader, [[Konstantinos Logothetopoulos]], who had fled to Germany after the Wehrmacht's withdrawal, was caught by the US military and was condemned to life imprisonment. In 1951, he was given parole and thus died outside prison. [[Ioannis Rallis]], the third collaborationist prime minister, was tried on a treason charge; the court sentenced him to life imprisonment. However, several lower and middle figures that had collaborated with the Germans, especially members of the [[Security Battalions]] and the gendarmerie, were soon released and reinstated in their posts; in the developing [[Greek Civil War]], their anti-Communist credentials were more important than their collaboration. Indeed, in many cases the same people who had collaborated with the Germans and staffed the post-war security establishment persecuted leftist former Resistance members.\n\nFurthermore, during 1945, a Special Court on Collaborators in [[Ioannina]] condemned, [[trial in absentia|in absentia]],<ref name = Konidaris>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=yoaOAAAAMAAJ&dq=Cham+Albanians+absentia&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=absentia Examining policy responses to immigration in the light of interstate relations and foreign policy objectives: Greece and Albania]\".

Between 1950 and 1961, this law was used to prosecute 29 Jewish Holocaust [[Kapo (concentration camp)|kapo]] murderers proven to have been Nazi collaborators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ben-Naftali|first=Orna|last2=Tuval|first2=Yogev|date=2006-03-01|title=Punishing International Crimes Committed by the Persecuted: The Kapo Trials in Israel (1950s-1960s)|language=en|location=Rochester, NY|ssrn=915708}}</ref> In 1960 [[Adolf Eichmann]] was captured by Mossad agents in Argentina and smuggled into Israel. On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death and then executed on 1 June 1962. In 1988 [[John Demjanjuk]] was sentenced to death too, but the guilty verdict was later overturned by the Supreme Court on 29 July 1993.\n\nOn 23 February 1965, [[Latvia]]n aviator and Nazi collaborator [[Herberts Cukurs]] was assassinated by the [[Mossad]], the Israeli foreign intelligence service, after being lured to [[Uruguay]] under the pretense of starting an aviation business.\n\n=== Norway ===\n{{main|Legal purge in Norway after World War II}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101III-Moebius-029-12, Norwegen, Besuch Himmler, Terboven und Quisling.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white image of a group of men, most of whom are dressed in the uniforms of military officers.

Seated (from left to right) are [[Quisling]], [[Himmler]], [[Terboven]], and General [[Nikolaus von Falkenhorst]], the commander of the German forces in Norway.]]\n[[Vidkun Quisling]], the war time Norwegian \"[[Minister President]]\", and, among others, [[Nasjonal Samling]] leaders [[Albert Viljam Hagelin]] and [[Ragnar Skancke]], were convicted and [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]]. A total of 45 people were sentenced to death and 37 were executed (25 Norwegians and 12 Germans). Both at the time and later these sentences were the subject of some debate, since the decision to reintroduce capital punishment to the Norwegian legal system for the post war trials was based on clauses in military law. Capital punishment in the Criminal Code had been abolished in 1904. The decision was made by the exiled Norwegian government in London in 1944, later to be debated three times in the Parliament during the trials, and to be confirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\n=== Poland ===\nIn [[German occupation of Poland|occupied Poland]] the status of ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' had many privileges but one big disadvantage: ''Volksdeutsche'' were conscripted into the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. The Volksliste had 4 categories. No. 1 and No. 2 were considered ethnic Germans, while No. 3 and No. 4 were ethnic Poles that signed the ''Volksliste''. No. 1 and No. 2 in the Polish areas re-annexed by Germany numbered ~1,000,000 and No. 3 and No. 4 ~1,700,000. In the [[General Government]] there were ~120,000 Volksdeutsche.\n\nAfter the war, Volksdeutsche of Polish origins were treated by Poles with special contempt, and also considered [[traitor]]s according to [[Polish law]]. [[German citizen]]s that remained on territory of Poland became as a group ''[[persona non grata|personae non gratae]]''. They had a choice of applying for [[Polish citizenship]] or being expelled to Germany. The property that belonged to Germans, German companies and [[German states]], was confiscated by the [[Polish state]] along with many other properties in [[Communist Poland]].\n\nGerman owners, as explicitly stated by the law, were not eligible for any [[Compensation (nationalization)|compensation]]. Those who decided to apply became subject to a verification process. At the beginning of the process, many acts of violence against Volksdeutsche took place. However, soon the verification of Volksdeutsche became controlled by the juridical process and was completed in a more controlled manner.\n\n=== Soviet Union ===\n[[File:Vlassof.Himmler.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrey Vlasov]] and [[Himmler]]]]\nRussian and other Soviet members of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] and the [[Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia]] such as [[Andrey Vlasov]] were pursued, tried, and were either sent to [[Gulag]] prison camps or executed.\n\nMany Soviet [[Prisoners of War]] were seen to have collaborated with the Nazis, even if they had done no more than been captured by the [[Wehrmacht]], and spent the war in a camp. Many such unfortunate Soviet citizens were persecuted upon their repatriation to the Soviet Union. In general, after a short trial, if they were not executed, Nazi collaborators were imprisoned in [[Gulag]] [[labor camp|forced labour camp]]s.\n\nThe [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was abolished and [[Volga Germans]] were banished from their settlements on the [[Volga River]] with many being deported to [[Kazakhstan]] or [[Siberia]].\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n[[Image:The Capture of William Joyce, Germany, 1945 BU6910.jpg|thumb|[[William Joyce]], who was \"Lord Haw-Haw\" to British wartime listeners, now silenced and under arrest, lies in an ambulance under armed guard before being taken from [[British Second Army#Germany, 1945|British Second Army]] Headquarters to a hospital.]]\nAt the end of the war a number of people were tried for high treason. These included members of the [[Waffen-SS]] [[British Free Corps]] and [[William Joyce]] (Lord Haw-Haw). As agreed at the [[Yalta Conference]], the British handed back many Soviet citizens to the Soviet regime. Some of these were collaborators who had fought in the Russian Liberation Army. In later years there would be a controversy because some of those handed over were [[White movement|White Russians]] who had never been Soviet citizens. Yugoslavs were handed over to [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s forces, and many were subsequently left alive.\n\nIn 1948 [[Viktors Ar\u0101js]], who was the leader of the eponymous commando unit which helped the Nazis murder the Jews of Latvia and Belarus, had been captured in the British zone of occupied Germany after the war but was allowed to go free. He remained at large until 1979 when West Germany put him on trial. One of Arajs's deputies, Harijs Svikeris, settled in Britain after the war and in the 1990s was thought to be a strong candidate to be prosecuted under the [[War Crimes Act 1991|War Crimes Act]], but he died before being prosecuted\n\nIn 1961 [[Ain-Ervin Mere]] was [[Estonian war crimes trials|put on trial]] for leadership in the murder of 5,000 foreign Jews in [[Estonia]], but his [[extradition]] was denied by British authorities. On 1 April 1999, [[Anthony Sawoniuk]] was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of murdering two Jews in the UK's first full Nazi war crimes trial. Sawoniuk had led \"search-and-kill\" police squads to hunt down Jews trying to escape after nearly 3,000 were massacred at Domachevo in Nazi-occupied [[Belarus]] during September 1942.

Hence, this article does not cover former members of the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] and their fate after the war.\n\n== Background ==\nThere were a number of motives for the apprehension of suspected collaborators.  The main motives were: revenge for those murdered, especially those murdered on ethnic grounds in the Holocaust (principally among [[Jew]]s, [[Poles]], and [[Russians]]); a desire after the war to see those responsible face justice, and be categorised as criminals by a court of law (See [[Nuremberg Trials]]); a means of ensuring that criminal acts done were brought to light and placed on the official record, with evidence, so that they could never be disproven (some of the acts being so unthinkable that [[Holocaust denial|denial]] was plausible); widespread sense that genocide of whole communities and cultures on such a scale was intolerable and must not be left unprosecuted even despite the inadequacy of existing laws; and fear that a \"Nazi underground\" of some kind existed, such as the mythical [[ODESSA]], which could allow the enemy to somehow regroup for their proclaimed [[Fourth Reich]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n== Means of pursuit ==\nThe pursuit took many forms, both individual and organised. Several organisations and individuals (famous [[Nazi hunter]]s) pursued [[ex-Nazi]]s or Nazi [[Collaborationism|collaborators]] who allegedly engaged in [[war crimes]] or [[crimes against humanity]]. The pursuit took varied forms such as individuals who reported they saw someone who they recognised, who had now assumed a false identity intent on slipping back into civilian life undetected. Specific individuals were named and sought by groups or governments for their crimes during the war.\n\nOthers were subject to after-war spontaneous retaliation committed by populations within occupied countries, which in some areas led to \"[[witch hunts]]\" for those suspected of having been collaborators, where vigilantism and \"summary justice\", were common. After a first period of spontaneous pursuit, provisional governments took the matter into their own hands and brought suspected criminals to court. The Nuremberg Trial in Germany judged only the highest German Nazi authorities, and each country prosecuted and sentenced their own collaborationists. [[Pierre Laval]] in France was judged and sentenced to death, while [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] was also sentenced to death, but [[Charles de Gaulle]] later commuted his sentence into a life condemnation. Government action took the form of investigation and interrogation of people suspected of collaboration. An example of such action was the [[Office of Special Investigations (United States Department of Justice)|U.S. DOJ Office of Special Investigations]].\n\nInfiltration of Nazi support and escape organisations (the most famous one being the [[ODESSA]] network and its various \"[[Ratlines (history)|ratlines]]\") and those believed to be aiding and abetting them. However, many suspected war criminals were also given [[amnesty]], and some reached high positions in post-war administrations (e.g. [[Maurice Papon]], who became [[Pr\u00e9fecture de police|Police Prefect of Paris]] in charge during the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362); he was blamed for the [[1961 Paris massacre]]). Others were never even tried such as [[Robert de Foy]] who resumed being head of the [[Belgian State Security Service]] 1945-1958.\n\n== Pursuit in specific countries ==\n=== Argentina ===\nIn 1960 [[Adolf Eichmann]] was captured by Mossad agents in Argentina and smuggled into Israel. Eichmann provided a location in Argentina where [[Josef Mengele]] had been but Mossad was unable to find him; by 1961 Mengele had moved to Brazil. In early October 1999, [[Nazi hunter]] [[Efraim Zuroff]] tracked [[Usta\u0161e|Ustasha]] [[Dinko \u0160aki\u0107]], the former commandant of [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] (nicknamed the \"Auschwitz of the Balkans\"). Sakic had lived in Argentina for more than 50 years. He was extradited to [[Croatia]] and sentenced by a Zagreb court to 20 years' imprisonment for his crimes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,22509603-5006789,00.html |title=Testimony 'clears' Zentai's name |date=1 October 2007 |author=Paige Taylor |accessdate=22 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Australia ===\nLatvia applied to Australia to extradite [[Konrads Kalejs]], allegedly a senior officer in the pro-Nazi [[Arajs Commando]], but he died on 8 November 2001 before he could be extradited.

Immediately after the liberation of Czechoslovakia by [[Red Army|Soviet]] and American armies, in an atmosphere of chaos, wild chases began. Individual acts of revenge, mob violence, and simply criminal acts motivated by the possibility to rob or loot targets, occurred. In some places were conducted, by organised groups of self-styled [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s, violence which resembled what is today known as [[ethnic cleansing]]. In most places this stopped when the provisional Czech government and local authorities took power. Other forms included legal action, undertaken by the state administration, after the war, until the regular Czech parliament was established. [[Edvard Bene\u0161|President Bene\u0161]] ruled by issuing [[Talk:Bene\u0161 decrees|decrees]], which were later ratified by parliament.\n\nBy decree ''5/1945'', property of untrustworthy persons was put under national administration. Untrustworthy were considered German and Hungarian nationals, and people who were active in destruction of the Czechoslovak state and its democratic government, supported Nazi occupation by any means, or were members of organisations considered fascist or collaborator. By the same decree, property of people of German and Hungarian nationality, who could prove they were anti-Nazi, could be returned to them.\n\nBy decree ''12/1945 Sb.'', farm property of German and Hungarian nationals or citizens was confiscated, unless they could prove active resistance against Nazism. Property of ''traitors, and enemies of the republic'' was confiscated, regardless of nationality or citizenship. By decree ''16/1945 Sb.'', special tribunals were started. These people's courts had right to sentence to long term imprisonment, life sentence or death. Prosecutions varied from verbal support to those who had committed crimes against humanity, no prosecution was based on ethnicity. By ''33/1945 Sb.'' people of German and Hungarian nationality or ethnicity lost their Czechoslovakian citizenship. However, they had right to apply for renewal.\n\nMost problematic was the law ''115/1946'', concerning resistance to the Nazi regime, which shifted limit of immunity to the year 1946, effectively amnestying all crimes, acts of individual revenge and atrocities against Germans and Hungarians long after the war.\n\nPeople who lost Czechoslovakian citizenship and failed to apply or did not get it were [[population transfer|transferred]] to Germany, many through the [[transfer camp]] established at [[Terez\u00edn]], near the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]].\n\n=== Estonia ===\nIn the [[Estonian war crimes trials]] of 1961 and 1962, several collaborators were sentenced for participation in the [[Holocaust in Estonia|Estonian holocaust]]. Many of the accused escaped punishment by escaping into exile or by suicide. The infamous [[Karl Linnas]] was finally deported by the United States and died in Leningrad while awaiting retrial.\n\n=== France ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}\n\n{{Further|Epuration l\u00e9gale}}\n[[File:Laval-shot0038.png|thumb|left|[[Pierre Laval]] and [[Philippe P\u00e9tain|P\u00e9tain]] in the [[Frank Capra]] documentary film ''[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]'' (1943)]]\n\nAfter the liberation, France was briefly swept by a wave of executions of suspected collaborators. Women who were suspected of having romantic liaisons with Germans were publicly humiliated by having their heads shaved. Those who had engaged in the [[black market]] were also stigmatised as \"[[war profiteer]]s\" (''profiteurs de guerre''). However, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] (GPRF, 1944\u201346) quickly reestablished order and brought collaborators before the courts. Many of the convicted were later granted [[amnesty]] under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] (1946\u20131954), while some prominent civil servants, such as [[Maurice Papon]], escaped prosecution altogether and succeeded in holding important positions even under [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] (1958 and afterward).\n\nThree periods are identified by historians:{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}<!-- Which historians examples needed -->\nThe first phase (''\u00e9puration sauvage'') consisted of popular convictions, summary executions, and the shaving of women's heads. Estimates by [[Pr\u00e9fecture de police|police prefects]] made in 1948 and 1952 were that as many as six thousand executions occurred before the liberation of France, and four thousand thereafter.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}<!-- source needed for specific numbers like these --> The second phase, ''[[\u00e9puration l\u00e9gale]]'' (legal purge), began on 26 and 27 June 1944 with Charles de Gaulle's ordinances on the judgment of collaborators by the ''commissions d'\u00e9puration''; the commissions sentenced approximately 120,000 persons. [[Charles Maurras]], the leader of the royalist ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]'', was, for example, sentenced to life imprisonment on 25 January 1945. The third phase was more lenient towards collaborators; the trials of [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] and the writer, [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]] are examples of actions taken during this phase.\n\nBetween 1944 and 1951, official courts in France sentenced 6,763 people to death (3,910 in absentia) for treason and other offences, but only 791 executions were actually carried out. More common was [[D\u00e9gradation nationale|\"national degradation,\"]] a loss of face and civil rights, which was meted out to 49,723 people.<ref>Judt, Tony, Postwar: ''A History of Europe Since 1945'', Pimlico (London: 2007), p. 46.</ref>\n\nPhilippe P\u00e9tain, the former head of [[Vichy France]], was charged with treason in July 1945. He was convicted and sentenced to death by firing squad, but Charles de Gaulle commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. [[Pierre Laval]] was however, executed after his trial. Most convicts were given amnesty a few years later. In the police, collaborators soon resumed official responsibilities. For example, Maurice Papon, who would be convicted in the 1990s for his role in the Vichy collaborationist government, was in the position of giving orders for the [[Paris massacre of 1961]] as the head of the Parisian police.\n\nThe French members of the Waffen-SS [[SS Division Charlemagne|''Charlemagne'' Division]] who survived the war were regarded as traitors. Some of the more prominent officers were executed, while the rank-and-file were given prison terms; some of them were given the option of doing time in [[Indochina War|Indochina]] (1946\u201354) with the [[L\u00e9gion \u00e9trang\u00e8re|Foreign Legion]] instead of prison.\n\nMany war criminals were judged only in the 1980s, including [[Paul Touvier]], [[Klaus Barbie]], Maurice Papon and his deputy [[Jean Leguay]]. The last two were both convicted for their roles in the July 1942 ''Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv'', or [[Vel' d'Hiv Roundup]]). Famous [[Nazi hunter]]s [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld]] spent decades trying to bring them to justice. A fair number of collaborationists joined the [[Organisation de l'arm\u00e9e secr\u00e8te|OAS]] terrorist movement during the [[Algerian War]] (1954\u201362). [[Jacques de Bernonville]] escaped to Quebec, then Brazil. [[Jacques Ploncard d'Assac]] became counselor of [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] in Portugal.\n\nReliable statistics of the death toll do not exist. At the low end, one estimate is that approximately 10,500 were executed, before and after liberation. \"The courts of Justice pronounced about 6,760 death sentences, 3,910 in absentia and 2,853 in the presence of the accused. Of these 2,853, 73 percent were commuted by de Gaulle, and 767 carried out. In addition, about 770 executions were ordered by the military tribunals. Thus the total number of people executed before and after the Liberation was approximately 10,500, including those killed in the \u00e9puration sauvage\"<ref>Jackson (2003), p. 577</ref>, notably including members and leaders of the [[Milice|milices]]. US forces put the put the number of \"summary executions\" following liberation at 80,000. The French Minister of the Interior at the time, March 1945, reported that the number executed was 105,000.<ref>{{Cite book|title=France: the tragic years, 1939-1947, an eyewitness account of war and occupation.|last=Huddleston, Sisley, 1883-1952.|date=[\u00a91955]|publisher=Devin-Adair|isbn=|location=|pages=299|oclc=1034908484}}</ref>\n\n=== Greece ===\n{{See also|Axis occupation of Greece during World War II}}\n\nGreece was under the control of the Third Reich from 1941 to 1944. After the liberation, the country followed a controversial period of [[denazification]]. Many collaborators and especially former leaders of the Nazi-held puppet regime in Athens were sentenced to death. General [[Georgios Tsolakoglou]], the first collaborationist prime minister, was tried by the Greek Special Collaborators Court in 1945 and sentenced to death, but his penalty, like most death sentences, was commuted to life imprisonment. The second collaborationist leader, [[Konstantinos Logothetopoulos]], who had fled to Germany after the Wehrmacht's withdrawal, was caught by the US military and was condemned to life imprisonment. In 1951, he was given parole and thus died outside prison. [[Ioannis Rallis]], the third collaborationist prime minister, was tried on a treason charge; the court sentenced him to life imprisonment. However, several lower and middle figures that had collaborated with the Germans, especially members of the [[Security Battalions]] and the gendarmerie, were soon released and reinstated in their posts; in the developing [[Greek Civil War]], their anti-Communist credentials were more important than their collaboration. Indeed, in many cases the same people who had collaborated with the Germans and staffed the post-war security establishment persecuted leftist former Resistance members.\n\nFurthermore, during 1945, a Special Court on Collaborators in [[Ioannina]] condemned, [[trial in absentia|in absentia]],<ref name = Konidaris>\"[https://books.google.com/books?id=yoaOAAAAMAAJ&dq=Cham+Albanians+absentia&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=absentia Examining policy responses to immigration in the light of interstate relations and foreign policy objectives: Greece and Albania]\".

A total of 45 people were sentenced to death and 37 were executed (25 Norwegians and 12 Germans). Both at the time and later these sentences were the subject of some debate, since the decision to reintroduce capital punishment to the Norwegian legal system for the post war trials was based on clauses in military law. Capital punishment in the Criminal Code had been abolished in 1904. The decision was made by the exiled Norwegian government in London in 1944, later to be debated three times in the Parliament during the trials, and to be confirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\n=== Poland ===\nIn [[German occupation of Poland|occupied Poland]] the status of ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' had many privileges but one big disadvantage: ''Volksdeutsche'' were conscripted into the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]]. The Volksliste had 4 categories. No. 1 and No. 2 were considered ethnic Germans, while No. 3 and No. 4 were ethnic Poles that signed the ''Volksliste''. No. 1 and No. 2 in the Polish areas re-annexed by Germany numbered ~1,000,000 and No. 3 and No. 4 ~1,700,000. In the [[General Government]] there were ~120,000 Volksdeutsche.\n\nAfter the war, Volksdeutsche of Polish origins were treated by Poles with special contempt, and also considered [[traitor]]s according to [[Polish law]]. [[German citizen]]s that remained on territory of Poland became as a group ''[[persona non grata|personae non gratae]]''. They had a choice of applying for [[Polish citizenship]] or being expelled to Germany. The property that belonged to Germans, German companies and [[German states]], was confiscated by the [[Polish state]] along with many other properties in [[Communist Poland]].\n\nGerman owners, as explicitly stated by the law, were not eligible for any [[Compensation (nationalization)|compensation]]. Those who decided to apply became subject to a verification process. At the beginning of the process, many acts of violence against Volksdeutsche took place. However, soon the verification of Volksdeutsche became controlled by the juridical process and was completed in a more controlled manner.\n\n=== Soviet Union ===\n[[File:Vlassof.Himmler.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrey Vlasov]] and [[Himmler]]]]\nRussian and other Soviet members of the [[Russian Liberation Army]] and the [[Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia]] such as [[Andrey Vlasov]] were pursued, tried, and were either sent to [[Gulag]] prison camps or executed.\n\nMany Soviet [[Prisoners of War]] were seen to have collaborated with the Nazis, even if they had done no more than been captured by the [[Wehrmacht]], and spent the war in a camp. Many such unfortunate Soviet citizens were persecuted upon their repatriation to the Soviet Union. In general, after a short trial, if they were not executed, Nazi collaborators were imprisoned in [[Gulag]] [[labor camp|forced labour camp]]s.\n\nThe [[Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was abolished and [[Volga Germans]] were banished from their settlements on the [[Volga River]] with many being deported to [[Kazakhstan]] or [[Siberia]].\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n[[Image:The Capture of William Joyce, Germany, 1945 BU6910.jpg|thumb|[[William Joyce]], who was \"Lord Haw-Haw\" to British wartime listeners, now silenced and under arrest, lies in an ambulance under armed guard before being taken from [[British Second Army#Germany, 1945|British Second Army]] Headquarters to a hospital.]]\nAt the end of the war a number of people were tried for high treason. These included members of the [[Waffen-SS]] [[British Free Corps]] and [[William Joyce]] (Lord Haw-Haw). As agreed at the [[Yalta Conference]], the British handed back many Soviet citizens to the Soviet regime. Some of these were collaborators who had fought in the Russian Liberation Army. In later years there would be a controversy because some of those handed over were [[White movement|White Russians]] who had never been Soviet citizens. Yugoslavs were handed over to [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s forces, and many were subsequently left alive.\n\nIn 1948 [[Viktors Ar\u0101js]], who was the leader of the eponymous commando unit which helped the Nazis murder the Jews of Latvia and Belarus, had been captured in the British zone of occupied Germany after the war but was allowed to go free. He remained at large until 1979 when West Germany put him on trial. One of Arajs's deputies, Harijs Svikeris, settled in Britain after the war and in the 1990s was thought to be a strong candidate to be prosecuted under the [[War Crimes Act 1991|War Crimes Act]], but he died before being prosecuted\n\nIn 1961 [[Ain-Ervin Mere]] was [[Estonian war crimes trials|put on trial]] for leadership in the murder of 5,000 foreign Jews in [[Estonia]], but his [[extradition]] was denied by British authorities. On 1 April 1999, [[Anthony Sawoniuk]] was sentenced to life imprisonment after being found guilty of murdering two Jews in the UK's first full Nazi war crimes trial. Sawoniuk had led \"search-and-kill\" police squads to hunt down Jews trying to escape after nearly 3,000 were massacred at Domachevo in Nazi-occupied [[Belarus]] during September 1942.

Signs and symptoms of preterm labor include four or more uterine [[Contraction (childbirth)|contraction]]s in one hour. In contrast to [[false labour]], true labor is accompanied by cervical dilatation and [[Cervical effacement|effacement]]. Also, vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, heavy pressure in the pelvis, or abdominal or back pain could be indicators that a preterm birth is about to occur. A watery discharge from the vagina may indicate premature rupture of the membranes that surround the baby. While the rupture of the membranes may not be followed by labor, usually delivery is indicated as infection ([[chorioamnionitis]]) is a serious threat to both fetus and mother. In some cases, the cervix dilates prematurely without pain or perceived contractions, so that the mother may not have warning signs until very late in the birthing process.\n\nA review into using uterine monitoring at home to detect contractions and possible preterm births in women at higher risk of having a preterm baby found that it did not reduce the number of preterm births.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Urquhart C, Currell R, Harlow F, Callow L | title = Home uterine monitoring for detecting preterm labour | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD006172 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28205207 | pmc = 6464057 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006172.pub4 }}</ref> The research included in the review was poor quality but it showed that home monitoring may increase the number of unplanned antenatal visits and may reduce the number of babies admitted to special care when compared with women receiving normal antenatal care.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Complications===\n\n====Mortality and morbidity====\nIn the U.S. where many [[neonatal infection]]s and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%.<ref>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathew TJ, MacDorman MF |year=2006 |title=Infant Mortality Statistics from the 2003 Period Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Set |journal=[[National Vital Statistics Reports]] |volume=54 |issue=16 }}</ref> Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk for having subsequent serious chronic health problems as discussed below.\n\nThe earliest [[gestational age]] at which the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is referred to as the [[limit of viability]].

One of the main organs greatly affected by premature birth is the lungs. The lungs are one of the last organs to mature in the womb; because of this, many premature babies spend the first days and weeks of their lives on [[ventilator]]s. Therefore, a significant overlap exists between preterm birth and prematurity. Generally, preterm babies are premature and term babies are mature. Preterm babies born near 37 weeks often have no problems relating to prematurity if their lungs have developed adequate [[Pulmonary surfactant|surfactant]], which allows the lungs to remain expanded between breaths. Sequelae of prematurity can be reduced to a small extent by using drugs to accelerate maturation of the fetus, and to a greater extent by preventing preterm birth.\n\n==Prevention==\nHistorically efforts have been primarily aimed to improve survival and health of preterm infants (tertiary intervention). Such efforts, however, have not reduced the incidence of preterm birth.

A 2015 [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane]] review supports the use of repeat dose(s) of prenatal corticosteroids for women still at risk of preterm birth seven days or more after an initial course.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Crowther CA, McKinlay CJ, Middleton P, Harding JE | title = Repeat doses of prenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth for improving neonatal health outcomes | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 7 | pages = CD003935 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26142898 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003935.pub4 }}</ref>\n\nBeside reducing respiratory distress, other neonatal complications are reduced by the use of glucocorticosteroids, namely intraventricular bleeding, [[necrotising enterocolitis]], and [[patent ductus arteriosus]].<ref name=\":2\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts D, Brown J, Medley N, Dalziel SR | title = Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 3 | pages = CD004454 | date = March 2017 | pmid = 28321847 | pmc = 6464568 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004454.pub3 }}</ref> A single course of antenatal corticosteroids could be considered routine for preterm delivery, but there are some concerns about applicability of this recommendation to low-resource settings with high rates of infections.<ref name=\":2\" /> It remains unclear whether one corticosteroid (or one particular regimen) has advantages over another.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brownfoot FC, Gagliardi DI, Bain E, Middleton P, Crowther CA | title = Different corticosteroids and regimens for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 8 | pages = CD006764 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23990333 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006764.pub3 }}</ref>\n\nConcerns about adverse effects of prenatal corticosteroids include increased risk for maternal infection, difficulty with diabetic control, and possible long-term effects on neurodevelopmental outcomes for the infants.

Signs and symptoms of preterm labor include four or more uterine [[Contraction (childbirth)|contraction]]s in one hour. In contrast to [[false labour]], true labor is accompanied by cervical dilatation and [[Cervical effacement|effacement]]. Also, vaginal bleeding in the third trimester, heavy pressure in the pelvis, or abdominal or back pain could be indicators that a preterm birth is about to occur. A watery discharge from the vagina may indicate premature rupture of the membranes that surround the baby. While the rupture of the membranes may not be followed by labor, usually delivery is indicated as infection ([[chorioamnionitis]]) is a serious threat to both fetus and mother. In some cases, the cervix dilates prematurely without pain or perceived contractions, so that the mother may not have warning signs until very late in the birthing process.\n\nA review into using uterine monitoring at home to detect contractions and possible preterm births in women at higher risk of having a preterm baby found that it did not reduce the number of preterm births.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Urquhart C, Currell R, Harlow F, Callow L | title = Home uterine monitoring for detecting preterm labour | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD006172 | date = February 2017 | pmid = 28205207 | pmc = 6464057 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006172.pub4 }}</ref> The research included in the review was poor quality but it showed that home monitoring may increase the number of unplanned antenatal visits and may reduce the number of babies admitted to special care when compared with women receiving normal antenatal care.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Complications===\n\n====Mortality and morbidity====\nIn the U.S. where many [[neonatal infection]]s and other causes of neonatal death have been markedly reduced, prematurity is the leading cause of neonatal mortality at 25%.<ref>\n{{cite journal |vauthors=Mathew TJ, MacDorman MF |year=2006 |title=Infant Mortality Statistics from the 2003 Period Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Set |journal=[[National Vital Statistics Reports]] |volume=54 |issue=16 }}</ref> Prematurely born infants are also at greater risk for having subsequent serious chronic health problems as discussed below.\n\nThe earliest [[gestational age]] at which the infant has at least a 50% chance of survival is referred to as the [[limit of viability]].

One of the main organs greatly affected by premature birth is the lungs. The lungs are one of the last organs to mature in the womb; because of this, many premature babies spend the first days and weeks of their lives on [[ventilator]]s. Therefore, a significant overlap exists between preterm birth and prematurity. Generally, preterm babies are premature and term babies are mature. Preterm babies born near 37 weeks often have no problems relating to prematurity if their lungs have developed adequate [[Pulmonary surfactant|surfactant]], which allows the lungs to remain expanded between breaths. Sequelae of prematurity can be reduced to a small extent by using drugs to accelerate maturation of the fetus, and to a greater extent by preventing preterm birth.\n\n==Prevention==\nHistorically efforts have been primarily aimed to improve survival and health of preterm infants (tertiary intervention). Such efforts, however, have not reduced the incidence of preterm birth.

Additionally, many legitimate at-home jobs are not like those in schemes are portrayed to be, as they are often performed at least some of the time in the company's office, require more [[self discipline]] than a traditional job, and have a higher risk of [[firing]].\n\nCommon types of work found in work-at-home schemes include:\n* Stuffing envelopes.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> The victim sees a flyer advertising a job stuffing envelopes, with \"up to 1,000 envelopes a week that you can stuff... with postage and address already affixed!\", offering a payment of $1\u20132 per envelope. To apply for the job, the victim is required to send a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] for information and a small processing fee. In return, the victim is sent a template for the flyer they had originally seen; the envelopes they stuff are from other people who answer the flyer, and the payment is the processing fee.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Assembly of items of some type, such as [[crafts]], [[jewellery]] or medical equipment. The worker is required to pay up front for materials and construction kits, and when they attempt to sell the finished products back to the scheme's organiser, they are told that the products \"don't meet our specifications\", leaving the worker with assembled products and no buyer.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Processing medical claims. The worker pays several hundred dollars for medical billing software, but will later discover that most medical clinics process their own bills, outsource their billing to established firms rather than individuals, or have stricter requirements than the purchased software can provide.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* [[Forum spam]]ming. Usually advertised as some variant of \"email processing\", the worker is simply given instructions on spamming online forums, and told they can make money by selling these same instructions online.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Sales of a product or service that is difficult or impossible to sell. This is often done in the form of a [[pyramid scheme]].\n* Talking on a [[phone sex]] hotline.\n\nSome adverts offer legitimate forms of work that really do exist, but exaggerate the salary and understate the effort that will have to be put into the job, or exaggerate the amount of work that will be available. Many such ads do not even specify the type of work that will be performed. Some similar schemes do not advertise work that would be performed at home, but may instead offer occasional, sporadic work away from home for large payments, paired with a lot of free time. Some common offers fitting this description are acting as [[Extra (actor)|extras]], [[mystery shopping]] (which in reality requires hard work, is paid close to minimum wage, and most importantly, does not require an up-front fee to join) and working as a [[nanny]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Police issue warning over horror film extras scam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/11/police-warning-horror-film-extras-scam|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Mystery Shopping in Australia |url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/mystery-shopper-jobs-in-australia-and-the-companies-to-work-for/#Mystery-Shopping-in-Australia-|publisher=Finance Informer|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Nanny Scams |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/jobsearchscams/a/nanny-scams.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Signs of a scam==\nSigns of a work-at-home scam versus a legitimate job may include:\n* Payment of fee is required prior to starting employment. In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] states that ''under no circumstances'' should anyone be forced to pay a fee in order to obtain a job. In many countries, no legitimate employer will require a fee be paid as a condition of starting work (except perhaps a small amount for a [[criminal background check]]).\n* Pay is too good to be true. Though there may be legitimate jobs in existence in which employees are paid to perform the particular task in question, even from home, in reality, they would be paid a wage that is fair for that type of work and level of education, not the $40 per hour or $3000 per week that is typically offered in a work-at-home scheme.\n* Employer will seemingly hire anyone, with no experience necessary and no qualifications. Legitimate work-at-home employers will only be interested in those who have the proper experience, skills, certification, and other qualifying factors, and will give at least some scrutiny to an applicant seeking employment. But the perpetrator of a work-at-home scheme is only interested in the payment required to join.\n* Company is little known, and does not seemingly have a customer base bringing them revenue from which they can pay employees. \n* Company name is similar to, but not exactly the same as a well known, legitimate company.\n* Company does not appear to have a permanent location. Its address, phone number, and website appear to be centered on recruitment of employees, not customers.\n* Company tries to show unnatural benefits of working in a very short period.\n* Company repeatedly tries to make contact until the victim replies.\n* Fake news stories and Web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-04-2011/scam-alert-fake-news-websites.html|title=Fake News Websites Pitch Get-Rich-Quick Schemes|author=Sid Kirchheimer|date=2011-04-20|publisher=AARP}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nThe consequences of falling for a work-at-home scheme may be as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://how-to-make-money-working-from-home.academehub.com/50-ways-to-work-from-home-with-online-business-or-not/ |title=Work-at-Home Schemes |publisher=Bbb.org |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref>\n* Loss of money: It may be only the initial fee to join, which may be a large or small amount. Some scammers will run after receiving just this fee. Others will continue to ask for more in order for the promise of high pay to be fulfilled. Some will act on a two-way street, actually issuing paychecks, all the while receiving payments of greater value in return, which in some cases have exceeded tens of thousands of US dollars. In other cases, the employer may obtain the victim's personal information for purposes of [[identity theft]].\n* Loss of legitimate job: Those with a real job may quit in hopes of a better one, only to find they cannot get their original job back after they discover their dream job was only a [[hoax]].\n* Damaged reputation: Those who engage in sales of a faulty or otherwise controversial product may be tarnishing their own name as the salesperson of such a worthless item.\n* Trouble with law: Some victims may actually receive money. But at the same time, they may be unknowingly breaking the law, on behalf of the perpetrator of the scheme, but will be fully legally responsible. Such violations may be criminal or civil in nature. In other cases, they will not be committing any criminal acts, but they will end up framed in an investigation for the crimes of the perpetrator.\n* Wasted time: Victims will often invest huge amounts of time with no pay in return. This is time that can be spent earning money at a legitimate job.\n* Victim's contact information is sold to other scammers, who then contact the victim with new scams.\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk]]\n*[https://www.techmaster.online/2020/03/how-to-earn-money-online-with-mobile-at.html?m=1 '''Work at home and earn money online Easy way''']<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techmaster.online/|title=TechMaster|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Employment}}\n{{Scams and confidence tricks}}\n\n[[Category:Recruitment]]\n[[Category:Confidence tricks]]\n[[Category:Crime]]\n[[Category:Deception]]\n[[Category:Finance fraud]]\n[[Category:Telecommuting]]\n", "text_old": "{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=February 2011}} \n\n[[File:Workathomead.jpg|right|thumb|300px|An ad for a work-at-home scheme posted on a pole]]\nA '''work-at-home scheme''' is a [[get-rich-quick scheme|get-rich-quick scam]] in which a victim is lured by an offer to be employed at home, very often doing some simple task in a minimal amount of time with a large amount of income that far exceeds the market rate for the type of work.

A 2007 report in the United States suggested that about 97% of work-at-home offers were scams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/TakeControlOfYourLife/story?id=3003833&page=1 |title=Working From Home: Don't Get Scammed |publisher=ABC: Good Morning America |date= 2007-04-03|accessdate=2009-07-03}}</ref> Many legitimate jobs at home require some form of post-high-school education, such as a [[college degree]] or certificate, or [[trade school]], and some experience in the field in an office or other supervised setting. Additionally, many legitimate at-home jobs are not like those in schemes are portrayed to be, as they are often performed at least some of the time in the company's office, require more [[self discipline]] than a traditional job, and have a higher risk of [[firing]].\n\nCommon types of work found in work-at-home schemes include:\n* Stuffing envelopes.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/> The victim sees a flyer advertising a job stuffing envelopes, with \"up to 1,000 envelopes a week that you can stuff... with postage and address already affixed!\", offering a payment of $1\u20132 per envelope. To apply for the job, the victim is required to send a [[self-addressed stamped envelope]] for information and a small processing fee. In return, the victim is sent a template for the flyer they had originally seen; the envelopes they stuff are from other people who answer the flyer, and the payment is the processing fee.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Assembly of items of some type, such as [[crafts]], [[jewellery]] or medical equipment. The worker is required to pay up front for materials and construction kits, and when they attempt to sell the finished products back to the scheme's organiser, they are told that the products \"don't meet our specifications\", leaving the worker with assembled products and no buyer.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Processing medical claims. The worker pays several hundred dollars for medical billing software, but will later discover that most medical clinics process their own bills, outsource their billing to established firms rather than individuals, or have stricter requirements than the purchased software can provide.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* [[Forum spam]]ming. Usually advertised as some variant of \"email processing\", the worker is simply given instructions on spamming online forums, and told they can make money by selling these same instructions online.<ref name=\"scambusters\"/>\n* Sales of a product or service that is difficult or impossible to sell. This is often done in the form of a [[pyramid scheme]].\n* Talking on a [[phone sex]] hotline.\n\nSome adverts offer legitimate forms of work that really do exist, but exaggerate the salary and understate the effort that will have to be put into the job, or exaggerate the amount of work that will be available. Many such ads do not even specify the type of work that will be performed. Some similar schemes do not advertise work that would be performed at home, but may instead offer occasional, sporadic work away from home for large payments, paired with a lot of free time. Some common offers fitting this description are acting as [[Extra (actor)|extras]], [[mystery shopping]] (which in reality requires hard work, is paid close to minimum wage, and most importantly, does not require an up-front fee to join) and working as a [[nanny]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Police issue warning over horror film extras scam |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/11/police-warning-horror-film-extras-scam|publisher=The Guardian|date=July 11, 2012|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Mystery Shopping in Australia |url=http://www.financeinformer.com.au/mystery-shopper-jobs-in-australia-and-the-companies-to-work-for/#Mystery-Shopping-in-Australia-|publisher=Finance Informer|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|title= Nanny Scams |url=http://jobsearch.about.com/od/jobsearchscams/a/nanny-scams.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=Feb 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Signs of a scam==\nSigns of a work-at-home scam versus a legitimate job may include:\n* Payment of fee is required prior to starting employment. In the United States, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] states that ''under no circumstances'' should anyone be forced to pay a fee in order to obtain a job. In many countries, no legitimate employer will require a fee be paid as a condition of starting work (except perhaps a small amount for a [[criminal background check]]).\n* Pay is too good to be true. Though there may be legitimate jobs in existence in which employees are paid to perform the particular task in question, even from home, in reality, they would be paid a wage that is fair for that type of work and level of education, not the $40 per hour or $3000 per week that is typically offered in a work-at-home scheme.\n* Employer will seemingly hire anyone, with no experience necessary and no qualifications. Legitimate work-at-home employers will only be interested in those who have the proper experience, skills, certification, and other qualifying factors, and will give at least some scrutiny to an applicant seeking employment. But the perpetrator of a work-at-home scheme is only interested in the payment required to join.\n* Company is little known, and does not seemingly have a customer base bringing them revenue from which they can pay employees. \n* Company name is similar to, but not exactly the same as a well known, legitimate company.\n* Company does not appear to have a permanent location. Its address, phone number, and website appear to be centered on recruitment of employees, not customers.\n* Company tries to show unnatural benefits of working in a very short period.\n* Company repeatedly tries to make contact until the victim replies.\n* Fake news stories and Web sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-04-2011/scam-alert-fake-news-websites.html|title=Fake News Websites Pitch Get-Rich-Quick Schemes|author=Sid Kirchheimer|date=2011-04-20|publisher=AARP}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences==\nThe consequences of falling for a work-at-home scheme may be as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://how-to-make-money-working-from-home.academehub.com/50-ways-to-work-from-home-with-online-business-or-not/ |title=Work-at-Home Schemes |publisher=Bbb.org |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2016-02-04}}</ref>\n* Loss of money: It may be only the initial fee to join, which may be a large or small amount. Some scammers will run after receiving just this fee. Others will continue to ask for more in order for the promise of high pay to be fulfilled. Some will act on a two-way street, actually issuing paychecks, all the while receiving payments of greater value in return, which in some cases have exceeded tens of thousands of US dollars. In other cases, the employer may obtain the victim's personal information for purposes of [[identity theft]].\n* Loss of legitimate job: Those with a real job may quit in hopes of a better one, only to find they cannot get their original job back after they discover their dream job was only a [[hoax]].\n* Damaged reputation: Those who engage in sales of a faulty or otherwise controversial product may be tarnishing their own name as the salesperson of such a worthless item.\n* Trouble with law: Some victims may actually receive money. But at the same time, they may be unknowingly breaking the law, on behalf of the perpetrator of the scheme, but will be fully legally responsible. Such violations may be criminal or civil in nature. In other cases, they will not be committing any criminal acts, but they will end up framed in an investigation for the crimes of the perpetrator.\n* Wasted time: Victims will often invest huge amounts of time with no pay in return. This is time that can be spent earning money at a legitimate job.\n* Victim's contact information is sold to other scammers, who then contact the victim with new scams.\n\n==See also==\n*[[The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Employment}}\n{{Scams and confidence tricks}}\n\n[[Category:Recruitment]]\n[[Category:Confidence tricks]]\n[[Category:Crime]]\n[[Category:Deception]]\n[[Category:Finance fraud]]\n[[Category:Telecommuting]]\n", "name_user": "Mahargha", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Work at\ufffc home and earn money online\ufffc easy way)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work-at-home_scheme"}

In general, in most countries, there are no laws which prescribe what clothing is required to be worn. However, the community standards of clothing are set indirectly by way of prosecution of those who wear something that is not socially approved. Those people who wear insufficient clothing can be prosecuted in many countries under various offences termed [[indecent exposure]], public indecency or other descriptions. Generally, these offences do not themselves define what is and what is not acceptable clothing to constitute the offence, and leave it to a judge to determine in each case.\n\nMost clothing laws concern which parts of the body must ''not'' be exposed to view; there are exceptions. Some countries have strict clothing laws, such as in some [[Islamic]] countries. Other countries are more tolerant of non-conventional attire and are relaxed about nudity.  Many countries have different laws and customs for men and women, what may be allowed or perceived often varies by gender.<ref Name=\"Kirby\">{{cite book\n  | last =Kirby\n  | first =Kathleen M. \n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =Indifferent boundaries: spatial concepts of human subjectivity\n  | publisher =Guilford Press\n  | year =1996\n  | location =\n  | url =https://books.google.com/?id=Y4PcShmKe-YC&pg=PA132&dq=different+laws+for+men+and+women,+public+nudity+is+legal+on+most+beaches#PPA124,M1\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-89862-572-6\n\n  | page = Chapter 5 }}</ref>\n\nSeparate laws are usually in place to regulate [[obscenity]], which includes certain depictions of people in various states of undress, and [[child pornography]], which may include similar photographs of children.\n\nIn some countries, non-sexual toplessness or nudity is legal. However, private or public establishments can establish a [[dress code]] which requires visitors to wear prescribed clothing.\n\nThere are a variety of laws around the world which affect what people can and cannot wear. For example, some laws require a person in authority to wear the appropriate uniform. For example, a police officer on duty may be required to wear a uniform; and it can be illegal for the general public to wear a police officer's uniform. The same could apply to firefighters and other emergency personnel. In some countries, for example in Australia, the [[Scouts Australia|boy scouts]] uniform is also protected.\n\nIn most [[Court|courts of law]], lawyers and judges are required by law or custom to wear [[Court Dress|court dress]], which may entail robes or traditional wigs.\n\nIn many countries, regulations require workers to wear protective clothing, such as [[safety helmet]]s, shoes, vests, etc., as appropriate. The obligation is generally on employers to ensure that their workers wear the appropriate protective clothing. Similarly, health regulations may require those who handle food to wear hair covering, gloves and other clothing.\n\nGovernments can also influence standards of dress shown on television through its licensing powers.\n\nIn addition to nude beaches and similar exceptional locations, there are some public events in which nudity is tolerated more than usual, such as the [[naked bike ride]]s held in several countries.\n\n== International laws and customs and culture ==\nThere are many specific circumstances where body parts have to be covered, often for safety or sanitary reasons.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia and Iran, women must conceal almost their entire bodies (see [[hijab]]).\n\n==Australia==\n\nIn [[Australia]], [[indecent exposure]] laws only refer to the genital area. However, many local councils impose their own rules, and have the power to ask topless people to leave an area.<ref name=Lifehackerau>{{cite news|title=Is it legal to sunbathe topless in Australia?|date=Nov 30, 2015|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Chris Jager|publisher=Lifehacker|url=https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2015/11/is-it-legal-to-sunbathe-topless/}}</ref> Additionally, women who go topless are sometimes slapped with more vague charges such as being a public nuisance, or offensive behaviour.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=How to Legally #FreeTheNipple in Australia|date=March 11, 2016|access-date= Nov 12, 2018|author=Katherine Gillespie|magazine=Vice.com|url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_au/article/mbv4pb/how-to-legally-freethenipple-in-australia}}</ref>\n\nOn public beaches, local bylaws are not heavily enforced, and women can often sunbathe topless without fuss.<ref name=Lifehackerau></ref>\n\nBreastfeeding in public places is a legal right in Australia.

Judges have held, for example, that [[nude sunbathing]] is not indecent.<ref>''R. v. Beaupr\u00e9'', 1971, British Columbia Supreme Court. Held: \"mere nude sunbathing is not of sufficient moral turpitude to support a charge for doing an indecent act.\"</ref> Also, [[streaking]] is similarly not regarded as indecent.<ref>''R v Springer'', 1975, Saskatchewan District Court</ref><ref>''R v Niman'', 1974, Ontario Provincial Court</ref> Section 174 prohibits being \"nude\" in a public place or in public view without \"a lawful excuse\", but defines \"nude\" only as being \"so clad as to offend against public decency or order\".

According to the government\u2019s Public Prosecution Service, the attorney general\u2019s consent is needed for two reasons: to avoid the specific harm that could result from prosecuting an innocent person; and to avoid the general harm resulting from prosecuting a case that isn\u2019t in the public interest.<ref> {{Cite web|url=https://criminal.findlaw.ca/article/is-it-legal-to-be-naked-in-canada/|title=FindLaw Canada {{!}} Is it legal to be naked in Canada?|website=criminal.findlaw.ca|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}} </ref>\n\n==Germany==\nGermany has a long history of allowing mixed sex public nudity in designated areas (e.g., beaches and parks).

Although nudity has gradually been tolerated on [[Sandy Bay, Cape Town|Sandy Bay]] in [[Cape Town]] after the National Party (NP) lost the election in 1994, and strict enforcement of its moral values is no longer applied, it is not an official legally recognised public nude beach. Partial nudity is also tolerated on other beaches.\n\n==United Arab Emirates==\nSince 2008, the municipality of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] has ensured that signs are posted on beaches warning women against topless bathing and indecent exposure contrary to the cultural values of the UAE. There is no fine for breaking this rule, however a warning is issued and if necessary, ejection from the beach.

The details of the law regarding [[public nudity]] differ substantially between them. In general nudity is not an explicit offence but there are various offences that may apply to nudity in unsuitable circumstances.

In some cases, a member of the opposite sex must be present.  In Florida, designated nudity areas are given an explicit exception.  There are also some specific prohibitions against sexual acts, such as having [[sexual intercourse in public]], or publicly [[caressing]] someone in a sexual way.  In Indiana and Tennessee, there are specific prohibitions against showing a noticeably [[erection|erect]] penis through clothing, or other sensitive areas through semi-transparent clothing.  In some states, indecent conduct can also occur on private property, depending on the intent or effect of the act.  In some cases there are exceptions for spouses, breastfeeding, and in New York, theatre performances. In most states, there is a governing state statute which defines the offense; in Maryland and Massachusetts, indecency is defined by [[case law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nudistlaw.com/state_laws.htm|title=Naturist State Laws|website=Nudistlaw.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>  Some local (county and municipal) governments also regulate personal exposure, as well as commercial activities such as [[strip club]]s.\n\nCase law in general governs the interpretation of the statutory definition, and in some cases allows for additional exceptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturisteducation.org/Toni_Egbert_Library/US_District_Courts/us_district_courts.html|title=US District Courts|first=Robert|last=Morton|website=Naturisteducation.org|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nudistlaw.com/Court%20Cases.htm#List%20of%20Cases|title=Nudist Court Cases<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Nudistlaw.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn general, exposure of the head, upper chest, and limbs is legal, and considered socially acceptable except among certain religious communities.\n\nFederal, state, and local regulations for certain occupations require various pieces of protective clothing for the safety of the wearer.  Such items include [[hard hat]]s, safety [[vest]]s, life jackets, [[apron]]s, [[hairnet]]s, and [[steel-toe boots]].\n\nIn the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear ([[sagging (fashion)|sagging]]).

In general, in most countries, there are no laws which prescribe what clothing is required to be worn. However, the community standards of clothing are set indirectly by way of prosecution of those who wear something that is not socially approved. Those people who wear insufficient clothing can be prosecuted in many countries under various offences termed [[indecent exposure]], public indecency or other descriptions. Generally, these offences do not themselves define what is and what is not acceptable clothing to constitute the offence, and leave it to a judge to determine in each case.\n\nMost clothing laws concern which parts of the body must ''not'' be exposed to view; there are exceptions. Some countries have strict clothing laws, such as in some [[Islamic]] countries. Other countries are more tolerant of non-conventional attire and are relaxed about nudity.  Many countries have different laws and customs for men and women, what may be allowed or perceived often varies by gender.<ref Name=\"Kirby\">{{cite book\n  | last =Kirby\n  | first =Kathleen M. \n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title =Indifferent boundaries: spatial concepts of human subjectivity\n  | publisher =Guilford Press\n  | year =1996\n  | location =\n  | url =https://books.google.com/?id=Y4PcShmKe-YC&pg=PA132&dq=different+laws+for+men+and+women,+public+nudity+is+legal+on+most+beaches#PPA124,M1\n  | doi =\n  | isbn = 0-89862-572-6\n\n  | page = Chapter 5 }}</ref>\n\nSeparate laws are usually in place to regulate [[obscenity]], which includes certain depictions of people in various states of undress, and [[child pornography]], which may include similar photographs of children.\n\nIn some countries, non-sexual toplessness or nudity is legal. However, private or public establishments can establish a [[dress code]] which requires visitors to wear prescribed clothing.\n\nThere are a variety of laws around the world which affect what people can and cannot wear. For example, some laws require a person in authority to wear the appropriate uniform. For example, a police officer on duty may be required to wear a uniform; and it can be illegal for the general public to wear a police officer's uniform. The same could apply to firefighters and other emergency personnel. In some countries, for example in Australia, the [[Scouts Australia|boy scouts]] uniform is also protected.\n\nIn most [[Court|courts of law]] lawyers and judges are required by law or custom to wear [[Court Dress|court dress]], which may entail robes or traditional wigs.\n\nIn many countries, regulations require workers to wear protective clothing, such as [[safety helmet]]s, shoes, vests, etc., as appropriate. The obligation is generally on employers to ensure that their workers wear the appropriate protective clothing. Similarly, health regulations may require those who handle food to wear hair covering, gloves and other clothing.\n\nGovernments can also influence standards of dress shown on television through its licensing powers.\n\nIn addition to nude beaches and similar exceptional locations, there are some public events in which nudity is tolerated more than usual, such as the [[naked bike ride]]s held in several countries.\n\n== International laws and customs and culture ==\nThere are many specific circumstances where body parts have to be covered, often for safety or sanitary reasons.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia and Iran, women must conceal almost their entire bodies (see [[hijab]]).\n\n==Australia==\n\nIn [[Australia]], [[indecent exposure]] laws only refer to the genital area.

However in practice, the likelihood of being prosecuted for nudity on a public ''beach'' is low, and in the past authorities have declined to prosecute topless and nude people on beaches.<ref name=freebeaches/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/taranaki-daily-news/editors-picks/6321828/Nudity-not-necessarily-an-offence|title=Nudity not necessarily an offence|website=Stuff|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11824550|title=Battle for the beach: Nudists clash with Papamoa beachgoers|date=2017-03-25|work=NZ Herald|access-date=2019-01-11|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991 a High Court judge quashed a conviction of offensive behaviour for nudity on a beach in the presence of children, on the grounds that, since the beach in question was \"a place where it was not uncommon for persons to sunbathe in the nude\", a reasonable person would \"regard the conduct... as inappropriate, unnecessary, and in bad taste, but not arousing feelings of anger, disgust, or outrage.\"<ref name=\"ceramalusvpolice\">{{cite court|litigants=Ceramalus v Police|reporter=AP No 76/91|court=[[High Court of New Zealand]]|date=1991-07-05}}</ref> New Zealand is a [[common law]] country, which means that judicial decisions determine the law that subsequent cases must follow.\n\n{{See also|Naturism in New Zealand#Legality}}\n\n==Qatar==\nIn [[Qatar]], the penal code punishes and forbids the wearing of revealing or indecent clothes,<ref name=Doha>{{cite news|title=Organizers are calling this campaign \"One of Us\" - not \"No Nudity\"|url=http://dohanews.co/post/24459500266/update-organizers-are-calling-this-campaign-one|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Doha News}}</ref> this dressing-code law is enforced by a government body called \"Al-Adheed\".

Offenders will be charged under Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act.\n\n==South Africa==\nIn [[South Africa]] specific clothing laws exist for the general public. Nudity is treated under indecent exposure. On 3 April 2015 the country's first official clothing optional beach, Mpenjati Beach near Trafalgar in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], opened after the [[Hibiscus Coast Local Municipality]] approved the South African Nudist Association's (SANNA) application. Although nudity has gradually been tolerated on [[Sandy Bay, Cape Town|Sandy Bay]] in [[Cape Town]] after the National Party (NP) lost the election in 1994, and strict enforcement of its moral values is no longer applied, it is not an official legally recognised public nude beach. Partial nudity is also tolerated on other beaches.\n\n==United Arab Emirates==\nSince 2008, the municipality of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]] has ensured that signs are posted on beaches warning women against topless bathing and indecent exposure contrary to the cultural values of the UAE. There is no fine for breaking this rule, however a warning is issued and if necessary, ejection from the beach. This was said to be in response to residents' complaints about tourists sunbathing topless or nude and changing their clothes in public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/dubai-takes-action-on-indecent-sunbathing|title=Dubai takes action on 'indecent' sunbathing|website=Thenational.ae|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are also signs at malls and shopping centers that advocates modest clothing which indicates that shoulders and knees must be covered, and public nudity is against the law. Violation of the law lead to a warning to cease and desist at first and would be followed with arrest if the person chooses to disobey the law.\n\n==United Kingdom==\nThere are three legal jurisdictions in the [[United Kingdom]] ([[England and Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]). There are a further three jurisdictions that are [[Crown dependencies]] ([[Isle of Man]], [[Bailiwick of Guernsey]] and [[Bailiwick of Jersey]]). The details of the law regarding [[public nudity]] differ substantially between them. In general nudity is not an explicit offence but there are various offences that may apply to nudity in unsuitable circumstances. What constitutes unsuitable circumstances varies according to the jurisdiction but nudity is legal in a much wider range of circumstances than many people assume.\n\nThe [[Crown Prosecution Service]] has published guidance for England and Wales.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/nudity_in_public/|title=Nudity in Public - Guidance on handling cases of Naturism|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service|website=Crown Prosecution Service|access-date=28 May 2017}}</ref>, as have the [[College of Policing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.college.police.uk/docs/nudity.pdf|title=Briefing note - Public nudity advice and decision aid|publisher=College of Policing|access-date=22 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[British Naturism]] has published guidance for England and Wales, and Scotland.

In some cases, a member of the opposite sex must be present.  In Florida, designated nudity areas are given an explicit exception.  There are also some specific prohibitions against sexual acts, such as having [[sexual intercourse in public]], or publicly [[caressing]] someone in a sexual way.  In Indiana and Tennessee, there are specific prohibitions against showing a noticeably [[erection|erect]] penis through clothing, or other sensitive areas through semi-transparent clothing.  In some states, indecent conduct can also occur on private property, depending on the intent or effect of the act.  In some cases there are exceptions for spouses, breastfeeding, and in New York, theatre performances. In most states, there is a governing state statute which defines the offense; in Maryland and Massachusetts, indecency is defined by [[case law]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nudistlaw.com/state_laws.htm|title=Naturist State Laws|website=Nudistlaw.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>  Some local (county and municipal) governments also regulate personal exposure, as well as commercial activities such as [[strip club]]s.\n\nCase law in general governs the interpretation of the statutory definition, and in some cases allows for additional exceptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naturisteducation.org/Toni_Egbert_Library/US_District_Courts/us_district_courts.html|title=US District Courts|first=Robert|last=Morton|website=Naturisteducation.org|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nudistlaw.com/Court%20Cases.htm#List%20of%20Cases|title=Nudist Court Cases<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Nudistlaw.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn general, exposure of the head, upper chest, and limbs is legal, and considered socially acceptable except among certain religious communities.\n\nFederal, state, and local regulations for certain occupations require various pieces of protective clothing for the safety of the wearer.  Such items include [[hard hat]]s, safety [[vest]]s, life jackets, [[apron]]s, [[hairnet]]s, and [[steel-toe boots]].\n\nIn the first decade of the twenty-first century there was some controversy in some southern U.S. states over the wearing of  trousers so low as to expose the underwear ([[sagging (fashion)|sagging]]). The practice was banned in some places.\n\nSome states and towns have loose, or no, regulations for requiring clothing. The city of San Francisco has a history of [[Social nudity in San Francisco|public nudity]], including at public events such as [[Bay to Breakers]]. The town of [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]], [[Vermont|VT]], experienced a brief period during which there was public nudity, until a law was passed banning it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brattleborochamber.org/one-and-only|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315061920/http://brattleborochamber.org/one-and-only|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 March 2013|title=The One and Only - Brattleboro Vermont|date=15 March 2013|accessdate=1 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Summary of various countries ==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Country\n! scope=\"col\" | Attire laws\n! scope=\"col\" | Maximum penalty\n|-\n|France\n|Chest and private parts must be covered except near bathing zones.

Nudity on private grounds is considered as legal even if visible from outside. The same applies for naked sunbathing as long as not otherwise stated by local laws. On the other hand, naked jogging or naked cycling have been considered in certain circumstances as public nuisance by several courts.<br>\nNote: The German Penal Code determines \"exhibitionism\" (sec. 183) as an act of public exposure committed by a man for sexual arrousal and \"causing a public disturbance\" (sec. 183a) as a sexual activity in public. Therefore, non-sexual nudity is not considered as crime or misdemeanour.\n|Section 118 of the Act on Regulatory Offences: \"(1) Whoever commits a grossly offensive act which is apt to disturb or endanger the public and to prejudice public order shall be deemed to have committed a regulatory offence.<br>\n(2) The regulatory offence may be sanctioned by a regulatory fine unless the act may be sanctioned pursuant to other provisions.\"<br>\nThe regulatory fine is between 5 and 1.000 Euros (sec. 17 (2) of the act). More likely, the local or state police may politely demand to cover up without further sanction or a cautionary fine of 5 to 55 Euros if immediately obeyed (sec. 56 (1) of the act).\n|-\n|Netherlands\n|Nude recreation in the Netherlands has been described in article 430a of the criminal law. The city council can designate public places found suitable for nude recreation. Nude recreation in such places is always allowed. This does however not mean it is forbidden everywhere outside these designated places. It is only disallowed in places accessible to the general public found unsuitable for nude recreation. Whether a place is suitable or not is decided by the judge, not by the government. There have been a number of law cases about this, so jurisprudence is available. In general most places have been found suitable.\n|A fine of the first category (maximum \u20ac 410,-).\n|-\n|Spain\n|Spanish law does not have any article that prohibits public nudity, it is therefore always allowed.
