This caused that several spectators demanded explanations to the TF1 channel. TF1 responded that according to the LPO (in English; League for the Protection of Birds), Puffinus pacificus are not a protected species. LPO asked the CSA (broadcasting regulator in France) to take up the case, and the latter also decided to initiate legal action against TF1 and the producer of the Adventure Line Productions program.\n\nThe petition against the production company was accepted, therefore TF1 was ordered to pay the LPO \u20ac 1,000 in damages and \u20ac 2,000 for procedural expenses, while the TF1 channel lawsuit against the LPO was rejected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news-de-stars.com/koh-lanta/koh-lanta-et-les-animaux-la-lpo-attaque-la-cha-ne-tf1_art29923.html|title=Koh-Lanta et les animaux : La LPO attaque la cha\u00eene TF1|last=|first=|date=|website=news-de-stars.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502115444/http://www.news-de-stars.com/koh-lanta/koh-lanta-et-les-animaux-la-lpo-attaque-la-cha-ne-tf1_art29923.html|archive-date=2013-05-02|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050711015515/http://www.tf1.fr/kohlanta/ (Official Site Archive)]\n\n{{Survivor|SURVINT}}\n\n[[Category:Koh-Lanta seasons|05]]\n[[Category:2005 French television seasons]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television season\n| season_number   = \n| image           = \n| image_alt       = \n| caption         = \n| module1         = {{Infobox reality competition season\n  | presenter       = \n  | num_days        = 40\n  | num_survivors   = 17\n  | winner          = [[:fr:Cl\u00e9mence Castel|Cl\u00e9mence Castel]]\n  | runner_up       =\n  | location        = [[New Caledonia]], '''''Isle of Pines''''' \n  | label1          = \n  | data1           = \n}}\n| country         = \n| num_episodes    = 13\n| network         = \n| first_aired     = July 1, 2005\n| last_aired      = September 6, 2005\n| film_start      = \n| film_end        = \n| episode_list    = \n| prev_season     = {{nowrap|[[Koh-Lanta (season 4)]]}}\n| next_season     = {{nowrap|[[Koh-Lanta (season 6)]]}}\n}}\n'''Koh-Lanta: Pacific''' was the fifth season of the [[France|French]] version of [[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]] Koh-Lanta.

web|url=http://tele.premiere.fr/Koh-Lanta-saison-5|title=}}</ref>, participants had to kill and cook Puffinus pacificus, a species of fully protected bird in New Caledonia. This caused that several spectators demanded explanations to the TF1 channel. TF1 responded that according to the LPO (in English; League for the Protection of Birds), Puffinus pacificus are not a protected species. LPO asked the CSA (broadcasting regulator in France) to take up the case, and the latter also decided to initiate legal action against TF1 and the producer of the Adventure Line Productions program.\n\nThe petition against the production company was accepted, therefore TF1 was ordered to pay the LPO \u20ac 1,000 in damages and \u20ac 2,000 for procedural expenses, while the TF1 channel lawsuit against the LPO was rejected.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.news-de-stars.com/koh-lanta/koh-lanta-et-les-animaux-la-lpo-attaque-la-cha-ne-tf1_art29923.html|title=Koh-Lanta et les animaux : La LPO attaque la cha\u00eene TF1|last=|first=|date=|website=news-de-stars.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502115444/http://www.news-de-stars.com/koh-lanta/koh-lanta-et-les-animaux-la-lpo-attaque-la-cha-ne-tf1_art29923.html|archive-date=2013-05-02|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050711015515/http://www.tf1.fr/kohlanta/ (Official Site Archive)]\n\n{{Survivor|SURVINT}}\n\n[[Category:Koh-Lanta seasons|05]]\n[[Category:2005 French television seasons]]\n", "name_user": "Nintenga", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eContestants", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koh-Lanta_(season_5)"}
