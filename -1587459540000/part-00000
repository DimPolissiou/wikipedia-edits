Additional lockdown restrictions mandated the temporary closure of non-essential shops and businesses. This quarantine came two days after the implementation of the community quarantine of [[Metro Manila]]. \n\nThe quarantine was originally set to last until April 12, 2020, although the government did consider to either extend or lift it after two weeks of its implementation. Duterte said on April 6, 2020 that he was inclined to extend the quarantine up to the end of April 2020. The next day, his Cabinet Secretary, [[Karlo Nograles]], said that the President accepted the recommendation of the [[Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases]] (IATF-EID) to extend the Luzon ECQ up until April 30, 2020.\n\nThe Luzon ECQ caused the mobilization of the Philippine government agencies and local government units as well the passing of Republic Act 11469 or the \"[[Bayanihan to Heal as One Act]]\" in order to fight the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. The economic, environmental, political, social and cultural impact of the lockdown affects around 57 million people under quarantine.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|2020 coronavirus pandemic in the

To meet the threat, a [[Roman dictator]] was appointed, [[Manius Valerius Maximus]].  Ten [[Roman legion|legions]] were raised, a greater number than had been raised previously at any one time, three of which were assigned to the consul [[Titus Veturius Geminus Cicurinus (consul 494 BC)|Veturius]] to deal with the Aequi.\n\nThe Aequi had invaded [[Latium]], and Veturius marched there to meet the enemy at the request of the Latin allies of Rome, rather than allowing the Latins to arm themselves.  Upon the arrival of the Roman army, the Aequians retreated from Latium to the safety of the mountains to the east.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2:30</ref>\n\nShortly afterwards, the Romans advanced into the mountains towards the Aequian camp.  The Roman consul would have preferred to delay any attack, because the Aequian army's camp was situated on a position which was difficult to approach.  However the Roman troops demanded that there be no delay, because of their anxiety to return to Rome as soon as possible because of the political events that had been fomenting there.  Therefore the Roman army advanced up the hill towards the Aequian camp.  The Aequi, however, were so stunned at the Romans' boldness that they abandoned their camp and fled.  The Roman army captured the Aequian camp, and took from it an abundance of booty, thereby securing a bloodless victory.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2:31</ref>\n\n==Attack on Rome in 488 BC==\nIn 488 BC the Volsci, led by [[Gaius Marcius Coriolanus]] and [[Attius Tullus Aufidius]], [[Roman-Volscian wars#Volscian invasion led by Coriolanus in 491-488 BC|laid siege]] to Rome.  Coriolanus, a native of Rome, relented and broke off the siege.  The Volsci eventually returned to attack Rome, and were joined by an army of the Aequi.  However the Aequi refused to accept the leadership of Aufidius, and as a result a dispute broke out and the two armies fought, diminishing the strength of each of them such that they were no longer a threat to Rome.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2:40</ref>\n\n==Ongoing hostilities from 485 BC==\nThe Volsci and the Aequi were together defeated again in 485 BC.  The consul [[Quintus Fabius Vibulanus (consul 485 and 482 BC)|Quintus Fabius Vibulanus]] incurred the anger of the plebs by lodging the spoils of victory with the ''[[Aerarium#Publicum|publicum]]''.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.42</ref>\n\nAgain in 484 BC hostilities with the Volsci and Aequi were renewed.  The Romans led by the consul [[Lucius Aemilius Mamercus]] defeated the enemy, and the Roman cavalry slaughtered many in the rout which followed.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.42</ref>\n\nThe Aequi took up arms again in 482 BC.  In 481 BC they laid siege to the Latin town of [[Ortona, Latium|Ortona]], and the Romans raised an army and placed it under the command of the consul [[Caeso Fabius Vibulanus (consul)|Kaeso Fabius]]. The Romans met the Aequi in battle, and routed them solely by a cavalry charge.  Due to popular discontent amongst the Roman army, both with the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] and with Fabius himself, the Roman infantry refused to pursue the enemy.  Fabius exhorted them to attack the fleeing enemy, but they refused, and returned to camp.  Nevertheless Fabius and the army returned to Rome victorious.<ref>[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 2.43</ref>\n\nIn 479 BC Kaeso Fabius was again consul.  The Aequi invaded the Latin territory, and Fabius was assigned an army to deal with the threat.  No significant battle was fought, because the Aequi retreated to their walled towns.  When word arrived that the other consul [[Titus Verginius Tricostus Rutilus]] was threatened by the Veientes, Fabius took his army to rescue his colleague.<ref>Livy, 2.48</ref>\n\nIn 475 BC the Aequi together with the Volsci invaded the Latin territory.  The [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]], joined by the [[Hernici]]  but without the assistance of any Roman troops or Roman commander, repelled the enemy and captured a significant amount of booty.<ref>Livy, 2.53</ref>\n\nIn 471 BC the Aequi again invaded, as did the Volsci.  The consul [[Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus]] was given command of the Roman forces against the Aequi. He successfully ravaged the enemy territory.  In contrast to his colleague [[Appius Claudius Sabinus Regillensis (consul 471 BC)|Claudius]] who had offended the plebeians and therefore lost the discipline of his troops, Quinctius suffered no military ill-discipline. Indeed his troops returned to Rome with praises for Quinctius, calling him their 'parent'.<ref>Livy, 2.58, 60</ref>\n\nIn the following year the Roman consul [[Lucius Valerius Potitus (consul in 483 and 470 BC)|Lucius Valerius Potitus]] again led Roman troops into Aequian territory.  He unsuccessfully attempted to assault the Aequian army camp, and instead ravaged the Aequian territory.<ref>Livy, 2.62</ref>\n\nThree years later in 467 BC, the Roman consul [[Quintus Fabius Vibulanus]] was sent into the Aequian territory with a Roman army.  The Aequi sued for peace, and peace was agreed.  However the Aequi broke the peace shortly after by a raid into Latin territory.<ref>Livy, 3.1</ref>  In 466 BC the consul [[Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 468 BC)|Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus]] led a Roman army into the Aequian territory to continue the war.  However an illness through the Roman camp prevented any military engagement.<ref>Livy, 3.2</ref>\n\nIn 465 BC Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, Roman consul for the second time, was given a special command against the Aequi.  He sought to persuade the Aequi to make peace, however the Aequi rejected that offer, and marched to [[Algidum]].  The Romans were so offended by the Aequian behaviour that the second consul, [[Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus]], was sent with another Roman army against the Aequi.  A battle was fought and the Romans were successful, following which the Aequi retreated to their own territory.<ref>Livy, 3.2</ref>\n\nHowever the Aequi immediately returned to Latium and began pillaging the countryside.  News of this fresh attack, at a time when both consuls were still absent from the city, caused panic in Rome.  The consul Quinctius returned to the city, and to calm the populace he declared the [[justitium]] and appointed [[Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 468 BC)|Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus]] as [[praefectus urbi]] during the consuls' absence.  Quinctius and his army then left Rome again, but were unable to locate the enemy to engage in battle.  He returned to Rome four days later and declared the justitium concluded.  Meanwhile the other consul Fabius successfully ambushed the Aequi and routed them, recovering all the bounty that had been taken from the Latin territory.  He then pursued the Aequi into their own territory and ravaged their lands, later returning to Rome with much bounty and glory.<ref>Livy, 3.3</ref>\n\nHostilities continued in 464 BC.  The Aequi allied with the Volscian town of [[Ecetra]] (already under Roman rule) against Rome.  The Hernici learnt of this alliance, and warned Rome that the Ecetrans had revolted.  The Romans also suspected that the Volscian town of [[Anzio|Antium]] (which included a Roman colony) would also revolt.  This suspicion arose because Antium had been defeated by Rome in 468 BC, and many of the chief opponents of Rome from Antium had fled to the Aequi, and had fought with the Aequi against Rome, and had subsequently returned to Antium.  The Roman consuls [[Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis (consul 464 BC)|Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis]] and [[Spurius Furius Medullinus Fusus (consul 464 BC)|Spurius Furius Medullinus Fusus]] summoned the chief men of Antium to Rome to explain their position, but they attended without reluctance and answered sufficiently that they were allowed return to Antium.<ref>Livy, 3.4</ref>\n\nThe Aequi invaded the Hernican territory, and the Roman consul Furius marched against them.  In an initial battle the Aequi were victorious, and the Roman forces were besieged in their camp.  The Hernici sent news of the defeat to Rome, and the senate declared the emergency decree, the [[senatus consultum ultimum]] (the first recorded occasion of that decree), urging the remaining consul Postumius to take all measures to protect the state.  Postumius remained at Rome to levy troops and Titus Quinctius, consul the previous year, was granted command of fresh Roman forces as [[proconsul]].  The Latin allies, the Hernici, and Antium, were each ordered to provide emergency troops.<ref>Livy, 3.4</ref>\n\nAequian forces were sent to invade Roman territory, and if possible to attack the city.  The remaining consul Postumius was sent to meet this new threat and Lucius Valerius, the consul of 470 BC, was left to defend Rome.  A justitium was declared for several days.<ref>Livy, 3.5</ref>\n\nMeanwhile the Roman forces led by the consul Furius burst forth from their besieged camp and attacked the Aequi.  The Roman attack initially succeeded, however the consul's brother [[Publius Furius Medullinus Fusus|Publius]], (who had been consul in 472 BC and was serving as a [[legatus]] under his brother's command) led his forces too far from the main Roman force, and was cut off and killed.  This led the consul to pursue him, and he was himself wounded and only just rescued from the enemy.  The Aequi besieged the Romans in their camp once again, and displayed the head of the consul's brother.  But then the proconsul Quinctius arrived with Latin and Hernican forces, and attacked the Aequian army.  The besieged Roman army again broke forth from the camp, and the Aequian army was soundly defeated.<ref>Livy, 3.5</ref>\n\nPostumius was also successful against the Aequian forces in the Roman territory, and he was joined in the attack by the returning Roman armies of Quinctius and Furius.  Livy, relying on [[Valerius Antias]] gives the number of Romans dead in Hernican territory as 5,300, and 2,400 Aequi killed in the Roman territory plus a further 4,230 Aequians killed fleeing with booty.<ref>Livy, 3.5</ref>\n\nThe Roman forces returned to Rome.  The justitium was ended.  The Latin and Hernican troops were returned with much thanks.  A force of 1,000 from Antium arrived too late to give assistance and were dismissed.  A number of portents were witnessed in Rome at the conclusion of this war, and a solemn festival of three days was declared to appease the gods.<ref>Livy, 3.5</ref>\n\n==Aequi uprising in 388 BC==\nIn 390&nbsp;BC a Gaulish war band defeated the Roman army at the [[Battle of Allia]] and then sacked Rome. The ancient writers report that in 389&nbsp;BC the Etruscans, the Volsci, and the Aequi all raised armies in hope of exploiting this blow to Roman power. According to Livy and [[Plutarch]], the Aequi gathered their army at [[Bolae]]. However, the Roman dictator, [[Marcus Furius Camillus]], had just inflicted a severe defeat on the Volsci. He surprised the Aequian army and captured both their camp and the town.<ref>Livy, vi.2.14; Plutarch, Camillus 33.1, 35.1</ref> According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], the Aequi were actually besieging Bolae when they were attacked by Camillus.<ref>D.S., xiv.117.4</ref> According to Livy, a Roman army ravaged Aequian territory again in 388, this time meeting no resistance.<ref>Livy, vi.4.8</ref> Oakley (1997) considers these notices of Roman victories against the Aequi in 389 and 388 to be historical, confirmed by the disappearance of the Aequi from the sources until 304. Owing to the dispute in the sources, however, the precise nature of the fighting around Bolae cannot be determined. Bolae was a Latin town, but it was also the scene of much fighting between Romans and Aequi, and it changed hands several times. Either an (unreported) Aequian capture followed by Roman recapture, or a failed Aequan siege, are therefore possible.<ref>{{cite book|first=S.

However the Aequi broke the peace shortly after by a raid into Latin territory.<ref>Livy, 3.1</ref>  In 466 BC the consul [[Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 468 BC)|Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus]] led a Roman army into the Aequian territory to continue the war.  However an illness through the Roman camp prevented any military engagement.<ref>Livy, 3.2</ref>\n\nIn 465 BC Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, Roman consul for the second time, was given a special command against the Aequi.  He sought to persuade the Aequi to make peace, however the Aequi rejected that offer, and marched to [[Algidum]].  The Romans were so offended by the Aequian behaviour that the second consul, [[Titus Quinctius Capitolinus Barbatus]], was sent with another Roman army against the Aequi.  A battle was fought and the Romans were successful, following which the Aequi retreated to their own territory.<ref>Livy, 3.2</ref>  \n\nHowever the Aequi immediately returned to Latium and began pillaging the countryside.  News of this fresh attack, at a time when both consuls were still absent from the city, caused panic in Rome.  The consul Quinctius returned to the city, and to calm the populace he declared the [[justitium]] and appointed [[Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus (consul 468 BC)|Quintus Servilius Priscus Structus]] as [[praefectus urbi]] during the consuls' absence.  Quinctius and his army then left Rome again, but were unable to locate the enemy to engage in battle.  He returned to Rome four days later and declared the justitium concluded.  Meanwhile the other consul Fabius successfully ambushed the Aequi and routed them, recovering all the bounty that had been taken from the Latin territory.  He then pursued the Aequi into their own territory and ravaged their lands, later returning to Rome with much bounty and glory.<ref>Livy, 3.3</ref>\n\nHostilities continued in 464 BC.  The Aequi allied with the Volscian town of [[Ecetra]] (already under Roman rule) against Rome.  The Hernici learnt of this alliance, and warned Rome that the Ecetrans had revolted.  The Romans also suspected that the Volscian town of [[Anzio|Antium]] (which included a Roman colony) would also revolt.  This suspicion arose because Antium had been defeated by Rome in 468 BC, and many of the chief opponents of Rome from Antium had fled to the Aequi, and had fought with the Aequi against Rome, and had subsequently returned to Antium.  The Roman consuls [[Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis (consul 464 BC)|Aulus Postumius Albus Regillensis]] and [[Spurius Furius Medullinus Fusus (consul 464 BC)|Spurius Furius Medullinus Fusus]] summoned the chief men of Antium to Rome to explain their position, but they attended without reluctance and answered sufficiently that they were allowed return to Antium.<ref>Livy, 3.4</ref>\n\nThe Aequi invaded the Hernican territory, and the Roman consul Furius marched against them.  In an initial battle the Aequi were victorious, and the Roman forces were besieged in their camp.  The Hernici sent news of the defeat to Rome, and the senate declared the emergency decree, the [[senatus consultum ultimum]] (the first recorded occasion of that decree), urging the remaining consul Postumius to take all measures to protect the state.  Postumius remained at Rome to levy troops and Titus Quinctius, consul the previous year, was granted command of fresh Roman forces as [[proconsul]].  The Latin allies, the Hernici, and Antium, were each ordered to provide emergency troops.<ref>Livy, 3.4</ref>\n\nAequian forces were sent to invade Roman territory, and if possible to attack the city.  The remaining consul Postumius was sent to meet this new threat and Lucius Valerius, the consul of 470 BC, was left to defend Rome.  A justitium was declared for several days.  <ref>Livy, 3.5</ref>\n\nMeanwhile the Roman forces led by the consul Furius burst forth from their besieged camp and attacked the Aequi.  The Roman attack initially succeeded, however the consul's brother [[Publius Furius Medullinus Fusus|Publius]], (who had been consul in 472 BC and was serving as a [[legatus]] under his brother's command) led his forces too far from the main Roman force, and was cut off and killed.  This led the consul to pursue him, and he was himself wounded and only just rescued from the enemy.  The Aequi besieged the Romans in their camp once again, and displayed the head of the consul's brother.  But then the proconsul Quinctius arrived with Latin and Hernican forces, and attacked the Aequian army.  The besieged Roman army again broke forth from the camp, and the Aequian army was soundly defeated.<ref>Livy, 3.5</ref>\n\nPostumius was also successful against the Aequian forces in the Roman territory, and he was joined in the attack by the returning Roman armies of Quinctius and Furius.  Livy, relying on [[Valerius Antias]] gives the number of Romans dead in Hernican territory as 5,300, and 2,400 Aequi killed in the Roman territory plus a further 4,230 Aequians killed fleeing with booty.<ref>Livy, 3.5</ref>\n\nThe Roman forces returned to Rome.  The justitium was ended.  The Latin and Hernican troops were returned with much thanks.  A force of 1,000 from Antium arrived to late to give assistance and were dismissed.  A number of portents were witnessed in Rome at the conclusion of this war, and a solemn festival of three days was declared to appease the gods.<ref>Livy, 3.5</ref>\n\n==Aequi uprising in 388 BC==\nIn 390&nbsp;BC a Gaulish war band defeated the Roman army at the [[Battle of Allia]] and then sacked Rome. The ancient writers report that in 389&nbsp;BC the Etruscans, the Volsci, and the Aequi all raised armies in hope of exploiting this blow to Roman power. According to Livy and [[Plutarch]], the Aequi gathered their army at [[Bolae]]. However, the Roman dictator, [[Marcus Furius Camillus]], had just inflicted a severe defeat on the Volsci. He surprised the Aequian army and captured both their camp and the town.<ref>Livy, vi.2.14; Plutarch, Camillus 33.1, 35.1</ref> According to [[Diodorus Siculus]], the Aequi were actually besieging Bolae when they were attacked by Camillus.<ref>D.S., xiv.117.4</ref> According to Livy, a Roman army ravaged Aequian territory again in 388, this time meeting no resistance.<ref>Livy, vi.4.8</ref> Oakley (1997) considers these notices of Roman victories against the Aequi in 389 and 388 to be historical, confirmed by the disappearance of the Aequi from the sources until 304. Owing to the dispute in the sources, however, the precise nature of the fighting around Bolae cannot be determined. Bolae was a Latin town, but it was also the scene of much fighting between Romans and Aequi, and it changed hands several times. Either an (unreported) Aequian capture followed by Roman recapture, or a failed Aequan siege, are therefore possible.<ref>{{cite book|first=S.

Merlin agrees to help Uther seduce Cornwall's wife, [[Igraine|Igrayne]], on the condition that he give Merlin whatever results from his lust. Merlin transforms Uther into Cornwall's likeness with the [[Excalibur (film)#The Charm of Making|Charm of Making]]. Cornwall's daughter [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana]] senses her father's mortal injury during his assault on Uther's camp, and while Igrayne is fooled and Uther impregnates her, Morgana sees through it, watching Uther as Cornwall dies in battle. Nine months later, Merlin takes Uther's son [[King Arthur|Arthur]]. Uther pursues but is killed by Cornwall's knights. Uther thrusts Excalibur into a stone, crying that \"Nobody shall wield Excalibur, but me!\", and Merlin proclaims \"He who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king.\"\n\nYears later, [[Sir Ector]] and his sons, [[Sir Kay|Kay]] and Arthur attend a jousting tournament. Sir [[Leondegrance]] wins the chance to try pulling Excalibur from the stone, but fails. Kay's sword is later stolen, and Arthur pulls Excalibur from the stone while trying to replace it. Word spreads, and Merlin announces to the crowd that Arthur is Uther's son, the rightful ruler. Leondegrance immediately proclaims his support for the new king. While the others argue, the overwhelmed Arthur falls into a long sleep. When he wakes, Arthur goes to aid Leondegrance, whose castle is under siege by Arthur's enemies, led by [[Urien|Sir Uryens]]. During the battle, Arthur defeats Uryens and then demands Uryens knight him, handing him Excalibur to do so. Uryens is tempted to kill him but is deeply moved by Arthur's faith and knights him. Uryens falls to his knees to declare his loyalty, which leads the others to follow suit. Arthur meets Leondegrance's daughter [[Guinevere]] and is smitten, but Merlin foresees trouble.\n\nYears later, the undefeated knight [[Lancelot]] blocks a bridge and will not move until he is defeated in single combat, seeking a king worthy of his sword. Lancelot defeats Arthur and his knights, so Arthur summons Excalibur's magic and defeats Lancelot, but breaks Excalibur in the process. Arthur is ashamed of abusing the sword's power to serve his own vanity and throws the sword's remains into the lake. The Lady of the Lake restores Excalibur to the king, Lancelot is revived and Arthur and his knights unify the land. Arthur creates the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]], builds [[Camelot]] and marries Guinevere; Lancelot confesses that he has fallen in love with her too. Arthur's half-sister Morgana, a budding sorceress and still bitter towards Arthur, becomes apprenticed to Merlin.\n\nLancelot stays away to avoid Guinevere. He meets [[Percival|Perceval]], a peasant boy and takes him to Camelot to become a squire. [[Gawain|Sir Gawain]], under Morgana's influence, accuses Guinevere of driving Lancelot away, forcing a duel with Gawain to defend his and Guinevere's honor. The preceding night, Lancelot is attacked by himself in a nightmare and awakens to find himself wounded by his own sword. Arthur hastily knights Perceval when Lancelot is late to the duel, but Lancelot appears just in time and defeats Gawain. Merlin heals him and he rides out to the forest to rest. Guinevere realizes her feelings for Lancelot and they have sex. Meanwhile, Merlin lures Morgana to his lair to trap her, suspecting that she is plotting against Arthur.\n\nArthur finds Guinevere and Lancelot asleep together. Heartbroken, he thrusts Excalibur into the ground between them. Merlin's magical link to the land impales him on the sword and Morgana seizes the opportunity to trap him in a crystal with the Charm of Making. Morgana takes the form of Guinevere and seduces Arthur. Before leaving, she reveals herself to Arthur, telling him that their illegitimate son will be the next king, much to his horror. On awakening to the sight of Excalibur, Lancelot flees in shame and Guinevere lies weeping.\n\nMorgana bears a son, [[Mordred]], whose [[incest]]uous origin strikes the land with famine and sickness. Arthur sends his knights on a quest for the [[Holy Grail]] in hopes of restoring the land. Many of his knights die or are bewitched by Morgana. Once Mordred grows to adulthood, Morgana has a suit of golden armor made for him, and casts an enchantment so that no weapon made by man can penetrate it. Mordred goes to demand that Arthur give him the crown. Arthur offers his love instead. Mordred rebuffs him, warning Arthur that he will return and take Camelot by force. \n\nPerceval narrowly escapes Morgana and encounters an ugly old man, who preaches that the kingdom has fallen because of \"the sin of pride\". Perceval recognizes the man as Lancelot. Perceval fails to convince Lancelot to aid Arthur, Lancelot and his followers throw Perceval into a river. Perceval has a vision of the Grail, during which he realizes that Arthur and the land are one. Upon answering the riddle, he gains the Grail and takes it to Arthur, who drinks from it and is revitalized, as is the land.\n\nArthur finds Guinevere at a convent and they reconcile. She gives him Excalibur, which she has kept. Frustrated in preparation for battle against Morgana's allies, Arthur calls to Merlin, unknowingly awakening the wizard from his enchanted slumber. Merlin and Arthur have a last conversation before Merlin vanishes. The wizard then appears to Morgana as a shadow and tricks her into uttering the Charm of Making, producing a fog from the breath of the dragon, and exhausting her own magical powers that had kept her young. She rapidly ages and Mordred kills her, repulsed by the sight of his once beautiful mother, now reduced to a decrepit old hag.\n\nArthur and Mordred's forces meet in battle. Lancelot arrives unexpectedly and turns the tide of battle, later collapsing from his unhealed self-inflicted wound. Arthur and Lancelot reconcile and Lancelot dies. Mordred stabs Arthur with a spear, but Arthur kills Mordred with Excalibur. Arthur tells Perceval to throw Excalibur into a pool of water, reassuring him that a new king will come and the sword will return. Perceval throws Excalibur and the Lady of the Lake catches it. Perceval returns to see Arthur lying on a ship, attended by three ladies clad in white, sailing away.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Nigel Terry]] as [[King Arthur]]\n* [[Helen Mirren]] as [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana Le Fay]]\n** Kay McLaren as the aged Morgana\n** Barbara Byrne as the young Morgana\n* [[Nicholas Clay]] as Sir [[Lancelot]]\n* [[Cherie Lunghi]] as Queen [[Guinevere|Guenevere]]\n* Paul Geoffrey as Sir [[Percival|Perceval]]\n* [[Nicol Williamson]] as [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]]<ref name=\"canbyquote\"/>\n* [[Corin Redgrave]] as [[Gorlois|Duke of Cornwall]]\n* [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[King Leodegrance]]\n* [[Keith Buckley (actor)|Keith Buckley]] as Sir [[Urien|Uryens]]\n* [[Clive Swift]] as [[Sir Ector]]\n* [[Liam Neeson]] as [[Sir Gawain]]\n* [[Gabriel Byrne]] as [[King Uther Pendragon]]\n* [[Robert Addie]] as Prince [[Mordred]] (as an adult)\n** [[Charley Boorman]] as young Mordred\n* [[Katrine Boorman]] as [[Igraine|Igrayne]], Duchess of Cornwall\n* [[Ciar\u00e1n Hinds]] as [[King Lot]]\n* [[Niall O'Brien (actor)|Niall O'Brien]] as [[Sir Kay]]\n{{div col end}}\n\nEven though he was 35 years old, [[Nigel Terry]] plays King Arthur from his teenage years to his ending as an aged monarch.\n\nSeveral members of the Boorman family also appear: his daughter [[Katrine Boorman|Katerine]] played [[Igraine|Igrayne]], Arthur's mother, and his son [[Charley Boorman|Charley]] portrayed [[Mordred]] as a boy.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord Of The Rings]]'' instead. Boorman was allowed to shop the script elsewhere, but no studio would commit to it. Returning to his original idea of the Merlin legend, Boorman was eventually able to secure deals that would help him do ''Excalibur''. Much of the imagery and set designs were created with his original vision of ''The Lord Of The Rings'' in mind, and it has been noted that certain scenes are reminiscent of Monty Python's 1975 comedy film, ''[[Monty Python And The Holy Grail]]''.<ref name=suburban>{{cite book| last=Boorman| first=John| title=Adventures of a Suburban Boy| publisher=Faber Books| date=1 November 2003| isbn=978-0571216956| pages=[https://archive.org/details/adventuresofsubu0000boor/page/178 178ff]| url=https://archive.org/details/adventuresofsubu0000boor/page/178}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Boorman, the film was originally three hours long; among the scenes that were deleted from the finished film, but featured in one of the promotional trailers, was a sequence where Lancelot rescued Guenevere from a forest bandit.\n\n===Casting===\n<!--the commentary track itself is the source for this section, no other is needed.-->Boorman cast [[Nicol Williamson]] and [[Helen Mirren]] opposite each other as Merlin and Morgana, knowing that the two were on less than friendly terms due to personal issues that arose during a production of ''[[Macbeth]]'' seven years earlier. Boorman verified this on the ''Excalibur'' DVD commentary, saying he felt that the tension on set would come through in the actors' performances.\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Cahir Castle in Excalibur.png|thumb|left|[[Cahir Castle]] during the siege battle sequence]]\n[[File:Exaliburdrive.JPG|thumb|''Excalibur'' locations trail in County Wicklow, 28 years after filming]]\n\n''Excalibur'' was filmed in Irish locations in [[County Wicklow]], [[County Tipperary]], and [[County Kerry]]. The early critical battle scene around a castle, in which Arthur is made a knight by Uryens, while kneeling in a moat, was filmed in [[Cahir Castle]], in Cahir [[County Tipperary]], Republic of Ireland, a well-preserved [[Architecture of Ireland#Medieval Ireland|Irish castle]]. The castle's moat is the River [[Suir]] which flows around it. The fight with Lancelot was filmed at [[Powerscourt Estate]]'s waterfall. Other locations included [[Wicklow Head]] as the backdrop to the battle over Tintagel, the Kerry coast as the place from which Arthur sails to Avalon and a place called Childers Wood near [[Roundwood]], County Wicklow, where Arthur comes on Excalibur in the stone.  At the time, John Boorman was living just a few miles down the road, at Annamoe.<ref name=Cinema1>{{cite book| editor-last=Manthey| editor-first=Dirk| title=Excalibur| newspaper=Cinema Programme 27| pages=15, 20| year=1981}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Boorman, the love scene between Lancelot and Guenevere in the forest was filmed on a very cold night, but [[Nicholas Clay]] and [[Cherie Lunghi]] performed the scene nude anyway.\n\n===Costumes===\n[[File:Autographed Excalibur Armor.JPG|thumb|upright|Autographed armor from the movie Excalibur in a pub in Cahir, Ireland, 2004]]\n\n[[Bob Ringwood]] designed the costumes and received a [[BAFTA]] nomination for his work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1982/film/costume-design |title=Film Costume Design in 1982 | access-date=21 December 2016 |publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]}}</ref> Terry English designed the armor and went on to craft the armor for the film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.\n\n==Adaptation==\n[[Rospo Pallenberg]] and [[John Boorman]] wrote the screenplay, which is primarily an adaptation of [[Thomas Malory|Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur|Morte d'Arthur]]'' (1469\u201370) recasting the Arthurian legends as an allegory of the cycle of birth, life, decay, and restoration, by stripping the text of decorative or insignificant details. The resulting film is reminiscent of [[mythography|mythographic]] works such as Sir [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' and [[Jessie Weston]]'s ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]''; Arthur is presented as the \"Wounded King\" whose realm becomes a wasteland to be reborn thanks to the Grail, and may be compared to the [[Fisher King|Fisher (or Sinner) King]], whose land also became a wasteland, and was also healed by Perceval. \"The film has to do with ''mythical'' truth, not historical truth,\" Boorman remarked to a journalist during filming. The Christian symbolism revolves around the Grail, perhaps most strongly in the baptismal imagery of Perceval finally achieving the Grail quest.  \"That's what my story is about: the coming of Christian man and the disappearance of the old religions which are represented by Merlin. The forces of superstition and magic are swallowed up into the unconscious.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite journal| url=http://americancinemapapers.homestead.com/files/EXCALIBUR.htm| title=John Boorman in Interview| work=[[American Film (magazine)|American Film]]| date=March 1981| last=Kennedy| first=Harlan| accessdate=2014-07-17}}</ref><ref name=dandalf>{{cite web |url=http://dandalf.com/dandalf/hollywoodgrail.html |title=The Quest for the Hollywood Grail John Boorman's Excalibur, and the Mythic Development of the Arthurian Legend ''(sic)'' |accessdate=8 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625172606/http://www.dandalf.com/dandalf/hollywoodgrail.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=25 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with this approach, the film is intentionally anachronistic.<ref name=\"interview\"/> For example, the opening titles state the setting to be the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], even though the knights wear full plate armour, a technology of the 15th century. Knights, knighthood and the code of chivalry also did not exist during the period. Furthermore, [[Great Britain|Britain]] is never mentioned by name, only as \"the land\".\n\nIn addition to Malory, the writers incorporated elements from other Arthurian stories, sometimes altering them. For example, the sword between the sleeping lovers' bodies comes from the tales of [[Tristan and Iseult]]; the knight who returns Excalibur to the water is changed from [[Bedivere]] to Perceval; and [[Morgause]] and [[Morgan Le Fay]] are merged into one character.\n\n[[File:London Film Museum (5094934492).jpg|thumb|upright|The film's sword Excalibur at the [[London Film Museum]]]]\n\nThe sword Excalibur and the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]] are presented as the same thing; in some versions of the legends they are separate.

Merlin agrees to help Uther seduce Cornwall's wife, [[Igraine|Igrayne]], on the condition that he give Merlin whatever results from his lust. Merlin transforms Uther into Cornwall's likeness with the [[Excalibur (film)#The Charm of Making|Charm of Making]]. Cornwall's daughter [[Morgan le Fay|Morgana]] senses her father's mortal injury during his assault on Uther's camp, and while Igrayne is fooled and Uther impregnates her, Morgana sees through it, watching Uther as Cornwall dies in battle. Nine months later, Merlin takes Uther's son [[King Arthur|Arthur]]. Uther pursues but is killed by Cornwall's knights. Uther thrusts Excalibur into a stone, crying that \"Nobody shall wield Excalibur, but me!\", and Merlin proclaims \"He who draws the sword from the stone, he shall be king.\"\n\nYears later, [[Sir Ector]] and his sons, [[Sir Kay|Kay]] and Arthur attend a jousting tournament. Sir [[Leondegrance]] wins the chance to try pulling Excalibur from the stone, but fails. Kay's sword is later stolen, and Arthur pulls Excalibur from the stone while trying to replace it. Word spreads, and Merlin announces to the crowd that Arthur is Uther's son, the rightful ruler. Leondegrance immediately proclaims his support for the new king. While the others argue, the overwhelmed Arthur falls into a long sleep. When he wakes, Arthur goes to aid Leondegrance, whose castle is under siege by Arthur's enemies, led by [[Urien|Sir Uryens]]. During the battle, Arthur defeats Uryens and then demands Uryens knight him, handing him Excalibur to do so. Uryens is tempted to kill him but is deeply moved by Arthur's faith and knights him. Uryens falls to his knees to declare his loyalty, which leads the others to follow suit. Arthur meets Leondegrance's daughter [[Guinevere]] and is smitten, but Merlin foresees trouble.\n\nYears later, the undefeated knight [[Lancelot]] blocks a bridge and will not move until he is defeated in single combat, seeking a king worthy of his sword. Lancelot defeats Arthur and his knights, so Arthur summons Excalibur's magic and defeats Lancelot, but breaks Excalibur in the process. Arthur is ashamed of abusing the sword's power to serve his own vanity and throws the sword's remains into the lake. The Lady of the Lake restores Excalibur to the king, Lancelot is revived and Arthur and his knights unify the land. Arthur creates the [[Round Table (Camelot)|Round Table]], builds [[Camelot]] and marries Guinevere; Lancelot confesses that he has fallen in love with her too. Arthur's half-sister Morgana, a budding sorceress and still bitter towards Arthur, becomes apprenticed to Merlin.\n\nLancelot stays away to avoid Guinevere. He meets [[Percival|Perceval]], a peasant boy and takes him to Camelot to become a squire. [[Gawain|Sir Gawain]], under Morgana's influence, accuses Guinevere of driving Lancelot away, forcing a duel with Gawain to defend his and Guinevere's honor. The preceding night, Lancelot is attacked by himself in a nightmare and awakens to find himself wounded by his own sword. Arthur hastily knights Perceval when Lancelot is late to the duel, but Lancelot appears just in time and defeats Gawain. Merlin heals him and he rides out to the forest to rest. Guinevere realizes her feelings for Lancelot and they have sex. Meanwhile, Merlin lures Morgana to his lair to trap her, suspecting that she is plotting against Arthur.\n\nArthur finds Guinevere and Lancelot asleep together. Heartbroken, he thrusts Excalibur into the ground between them. Merlin's magical link to the land impales him on the sword and Morgana seizes the opportunity to trap him in a crystal with the Charm of Making. Morgana takes the form of Guinevere and seduces Arthur. Before leaving, she reveals herself to Arthur, telling him that their illegitimate son will be the next king, much to his horror. On awakening to the sight of Excalibur, Lancelot flees in shame and Guinevere lies weeping.\n\nMorgana bears a son, [[Mordred]], whose [[incest]]uous origin strikes the land with famine and sickness. Arthur sends his knights on a quest for the [[Holy Grail]] in hopes of restoring the land. Many of his knights die or are bewitched by Morgana. Once Mordred grows to adulthood, Morgana has a suit of golden armor made for him, and casts an enchantment so that no weapon made by man can penetrate it. Mordred goes to demand that Arthur give him the crown. Arthur offers his love instead. Mordred rebuffs him, warning Arthur that he will return and take Camelot by force. \n\nPerceval narrowly escapes Morgana and encounters an ugly old man, who preaches that the kingdom has fallen because of \"the sin of pride\". Perceval recognizes the man as Lancelot. Perceval fails to convince Lancelot to aid Arthur, Lancelot and his followers throw Perceval into a river. Perceval has a vision of the Grail, during which he realizes that Arthur and the land are one. Upon answering the riddle, he gains the Grail and takes it to Arthur, who drinks from it and is revitalized, as is the land.\n\nArthur finds Guinevere at a convent and they reconcile. She gives him Excalibur, which she has kept. Frustrated in preparation for battle against Morgana's allies, Arthur calls to Merlin, unknowingly awakening the wizard from his enchanted slumber. Merlin and Arthur have a last conversation before Merlin vanishes. The wizard then appears to Morgana as a shadow and tricks her into uttering the Charm of Making, producing a fog from the breath of the dragon, and exhausting her own magical powers that had kept her young. She rapidly ages and Mordred kills her, repulsed by the sight of his once beautiful mother, now reduced to a decrepit old hag.\n\nArthur and Mordred's forces meet in battle. Lancelot arrives unexpectedly and turns the tide of battle, later collapsing from his unhealed self-inflicted wound. Arthur and Lancelot reconcile and Lancelot dies.

R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord Of The Rings]]'' instead. Boorman was allowed to shop the script elsewhere, but no studio would commit to it. Returning to his original idea of the Merlin legend, Boorman was eventually able to secure deals that would help him do ''Excalibur''. Much of the imagery and set designs were created with his original vision of ''The Lord Of The Rings'' in mind, and it has been noted that certain scenes are reminiscent of Monty Python's 1975 comedy film, ''[[Monty Python And The Holy Grail]]''.<ref name=suburban>{{cite book| last=Boorman| first=John| title=Adventures of a Suburban Boy| publisher=Faber Books| date=1 November 2003| isbn=978-0571216956| pages=[https://archive.org/details/adventuresofsubu0000boor/page/178 178ff]| url=https://archive.org/details/adventuresofsubu0000boor/page/178}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Boorman, the film was originally three hours long; among the scenes that were deleted from the finished film, but featured in one of the promotional trailers, was a sequence where Lancelot rescued Guenevere from a forest bandit.\n\n===Casting===\n<!--the commentary track itself is the source for this section, no other is needed.-->Boorman cast [[Nicol Williamson]] and [[Helen Mirren]] opposite each other as Merlin and Morgana, knowing that the two were on less than friendly terms due to personal issues that arose during a production of ''[[Macbeth]]'' seven years earlier. Boorman verified this on the ''Excalibur'' DVD commentary, saying he felt that the tension on set would come through in the actors' performances.\n\n===Filming===\n[[File:Cahir Castle in Excalibur.png|thumb|left|[[Cahir Castle]] during the siege battle sequence]]\n[[File:Exaliburdrive.JPG|thumb|''Excalibur'' locations trail in County Wicklow, 28 years after filming]]\n\n''Excalibur'' was filmed in Irish locations in [[County Wicklow]], [[County Tipperary]], and [[County Kerry]]. The early critical battle scene around a castle, in which Arthur is made a knight by Uryens, while kneeling in a moat, was filmed in [[Cahir Castle]], in Cahir [[County Tipperary]], Republic of Ireland, a well-preserved [[Architecture of Ireland#Medieval Ireland|Irish castle]]. The castle's moat is the River [[Suir]] which flows around it. The fight with Lancelot was filmed at [[Powerscourt Estate]]'s waterfall. Other locations included [[Wicklow Head]] as the backdrop to the battle over Tintagel, the Kerry coast as the place from which Arthur sails to Avalon and a place called Childers Wood near [[Roundwood]], County Wicklow, where Arthur comes on Excalibur in the stone.  At the time, John Boorman was living just a few miles down the road, at Annamoe.<ref name=Cinema1>{{cite book| editor-last=Manthey| editor-first=Dirk| title=Excalibur| newspaper=Cinema Programme 27| pages=15, 20| year=1981}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Boorman, the love scene between Lancelot and Guenevere in the forest was filmed on a very cold night, but [[Nicholas Clay]] and [[Cherie Lunghi]] performed the scene nude anyway.\n\n===Costumes===\n[[File:Autographed Excalibur Armor.JPG|thumb|upright|Autographed armor from the movie Excalibur in a pub in Cahir, Ireland, 2004]]\n\n[[Bob Ringwood]] designed the costumes and received a [[BAFTA]] nomination for his work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/1982/film/costume-design |title=Film Costume Design in 1982 | access-date=21 December 2016 |publisher=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]]}}</ref> Terry English designed the armor and went on to craft the armor for the film ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]''.\n\n==Adaptation==\n[[Rospo Pallenberg]] and [[John Boorman]] wrote the screenplay, which is primarily an adaptation of [[Thomas Malory|Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur|Morte d'Arthur]]'' (1469\u201370) recasting the Arthurian legends as an allegory of the cycle of birth, life, decay, and restoration, by stripping the text of decorative or insignificant details. The resulting film is reminiscent of [[mythography|mythographic]] works such as Sir [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' and [[Jessie Weston]]'s ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]''; Arthur is presented as the \"Wounded King\" whose realm becomes a wasteland to be reborn thanks to the Grail, and may be compared to the [[Fisher King|Fisher (or Sinner) King]], whose land also became a wasteland, and was also healed by Perceval. \"The film has to do with ''mythical'' truth, not historical truth,\" Boorman remarked to a journalist during filming. The Christian symbolism revolves around the Grail, perhaps most strongly in the baptismal imagery of Perceval finally achieving the Grail quest.  \"That's what my story is about: the coming of Christian man and the disappearance of the old religions which are represented by Merlin. The forces of superstition and magic are swallowed up into the unconscious.\"<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite journal| url=http://americancinemapapers.homestead.com/files/EXCALIBUR.htm| title=John Boorman in Interview| work=[[American Film (magazine)|American Film]]| date=March 1981| last=Kennedy| first=Harlan| accessdate=2014-07-17}}</ref><ref name=dandalf>{{cite web |url=http://dandalf.com/dandalf/hollywoodgrail.html |title=The Quest for the Hollywood Grail John Boorman's Excalibur, and the Mythic Development of the Arthurian Legend ''(sic)'' |accessdate=8 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625172606/http://www.dandalf.com/dandalf/hollywoodgrail.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=25 June 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with this approach, the film is intentionally anachronistic.<ref name=\"interview\"/> For example, the opening titles state the setting to be the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], even though the knights wear full plate armour, a technology of the 15th century. Knights, knighthood and the code of chivalry also did not exist during the period. Furthermore, [[Great Britain|Britain]] is never mentioned by name, only as \"the land\".\n\nIn addition to Malory, the writers incorporated elements from other Arthurian stories, sometimes altering them. For example, the sword between the sleeping lovers' bodies comes from the tales of [[Tristan and Iseult]]; the knight who returns Excalibur to the water is changed from [[Bedivere]] to Perceval; and [[Morgause]] and [[Morgan Le Fay]] are merged into one character.\n\n[[File:London Film Museum (5094934492).jpg|thumb|upright|The film's sword Excalibur at the [[London Film Museum]]]]\n\nThe sword Excalibur and the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]] are presented as the same thing; in some versions of the legends they are separate. In ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'', Sir Galahad, the illegitimate son of Lancelot and Elaine of Carbonek, is actually the Knight who is worthy of the Holy Grail. Boorman follows the earlier version of the tale as told by [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]], making Perceval the grail winner.\n\nSome new elements were added, such as Uther wielding Excalibur before Arthur (repeated in ''[[Merlin (miniseries)|Merlin]]''), Merlin's 'Charm of Making' (written in [[Old Irish]]), and the concept of the world as \"the dragon\" (probably inspired by the dragon omen seen in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s account of Merlin's life).<ref>Geoffrey of Monmouth: [[Historia Regum Britanniae|History of the Kings of Britain]], VII, 3.</ref>\n\n===The Charm of Making===\nAccording to [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Michael Everson]], the \"Charm of Making\" that Merlin speaks to invoke the dragon is an invention, there being no attested source for the charm.

She gained recognition by winning both the 1984 [[Ang Bagong Kampeon]] and the 1989 [[Asia-Pacific Song Contest]], representing the Philippines in the latter. Velasquez rose to fame with the release of \"Kung Maibabalik Ko Lang\" from her [[Regine (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1987. The album was generally well received and produced two more singles, \"Urong Sulong\" and \"Isang Lahi\", that established her as a commercially viable [[Music of the Philippines#Original Pilipino Music|Filipino pop]] artist.\n\nVelasquez signed a recording contract with [[Polygram|Polygram Records]] in 1994 and released ''[[Listen Without Prejudice (Regine Velasquez album)|Listen Without Prejudice]]'', marking her debut as an up-and-coming artist in the [[Music of Asia|Southeast and East Asian region]]. It became her best-selling record in the region to date and produced {{nowrap|\"In Love With You\"}}, which became her most successful single of the 1990s. Its accompanying music video was named Video of the Decade by [[MTV Asia]]. Velasquez parted with Polygram in 1997, citing a lack of creative control over her music and public image, and signed a record deal with [[VIVA Records]] the following year. She was given full conceptual and creative control as the executive producer of ''[[R2K]]'' (1999). The album became the [[List of best-selling albums in the Philippines|best-selling album by a female artist]] in the Philippines, and the best-selling album by a local artist in 1999 and 2000.\n\nVelasquez ventured into film with a lead role in ''[[Regine Velasquez filmography#Movies|Wanted Perfect Mother]]'' (1996). She continued to play female lead roles in romantic comedy films \u2014 including ''[[Kailangan Ko'y Ikaw]]'' (2000) and ''Pangako Ikaw Lang'' (2001), with the latter being the highest-grossing Filipino film in 2001. She has also been successful in television with the shows ''[[Maalaala Mo Kaya#Notable episodes|Maalaala Mo Kaya]]'' (2002), ''[[Forever In My Heart]]'' (2004), ''[[Diva (2010 TV series)|Diva]]''{{nbsp}}(2010) and ''[[Poor Se\u00f1orita]]'' (2016). In the first of these, she appeared as a mentally challenged woman in a featured episode, which earned her a [[16th PMPC Star Awards for Television|Star Award for Best Actress]], while the other three were lead roles in prime time television shows.\n\nDuring her career, Velasquez has sold more than 8.5 million records regionally. According to the [[Philippine Association of the Record Industry]] (PARI) she is the 2nd [[List of best-selling albums in the Philippines|best-selling artist of all time]] in the Philippines after [[Lea Salonga]] (who sold 19 million albums worldwide)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://usa.inquirer.net/30007/lea-salonga-grateful-and-thriving-despite-injury|title=Lea Salonga grateful and thriving despite injury|last=Szpytma|first=Grace Garcia|date=2019-05-21|website=INQUIRER.net USA|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>, with seven million certified albums sold domestically and a further 1.5{{nbsp}}million in Southeast and East Asia.

She gained recognition by winning both the 1984 [[Ang Bagong Kampeon]] and the 1989 [[Asia-Pacific Song Contest]], representing the Philippines in the latter. Velasquez rose to fame with the release of \"Kung Maibabalik Ko Lang\" from her [[Regine (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1987. The album was generally well received and produced two more singles, \"Urong Sulong\" and \"Isang Lahi\", that established her as a commercially viable [[Music of the Philippines#Original Pilipino Music|Filipino pop]] artist.\n\nVelasquez signed a recording contract with [[Polygram|Polygram Records]] in 1994 and released ''[[Listen Without Prejudice (Regine Velasquez album)|Listen Without Prejudice]]'', marking her debut as an up-and-coming artist in the [[Music of Asia|Southeast and East Asian region]]. It became her best-selling record in the region to date and produced {{nowrap|\"In Love With You\"}}, which became her most successful single of the 1990s. Its accompanying music video was named Video of the Decade by [[MTV Asia]]. Velasquez parted with Polygram in 1997, citing a lack of creative control over her music and public image, and signed a record deal with [[VIVA Records]] the following year. She was given full conceptual and creative control as the executive producer of ''[[R2K]]'' (1999). The album became the [[List of best-selling albums in the Philippines|best-selling album by a female artist]] in the Philippines, and the best-selling album by a local artist in 1999 and 2000.\n\nVelasquez ventured into film with a lead role in ''[[Regine Velasquez filmography#Movies|Wanted Perfect Mother]]'' (1996). She continued to play female lead roles in romantic comedy films \u2014 including ''[[Kailangan Ko'y Ikaw]]'' (2000) and ''Pangako Ikaw Lang'' (2001), with the latter being the highest-grossing Filipino film in 2001. She has also been successful in television with the shows ''[[Maalaala Mo Kaya#Notable episodes|Maalaala Mo Kaya]]'' (2002), ''[[Forever In My Heart]]'' (2004), ''[[Diva (2010 TV series)|Diva]]''{{nbsp}}(2010) and ''[[Poor Se\u00f1orita]]'' (2016). In the first of these, she appeared as a mentally challenged woman in a featured episode, which earned her a [[16th PMPC Star Awards for Television|Star Award for Best Actress]], while the other three were lead roles in prime time television shows.\n\nDuring her career, Velasquez has sold more than 8.5 million records regionally.
