Its [[electrical resistance|resistance]] falls as its temperature rises; metals are the opposite. Its conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by introducing impurities (\"[[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]]\") into the [[crystal structure]]. When two differently-doped regions exist in the same crystal, a [[semiconductor junction]] is created. The behavior of [[charge carrier]]s which include [[electron]]s, [[ion]]s and [[electron hole]]s at these junctions is the basis of [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s and all modern [[electronics]]. Some examples of semiconductors are [[silicon]], [[germanium]], [[gallium arsenide]], and elements near the so-called \"[[metalloid staircase]]\" on the periodic table. After silicon, gallium arsenide is the second most common semiconductor{{cn|date=October 2018}} and is used in laser diodes, solar cells, microwave-frequency integrated circuits and others. Silicon is a critical element for fabricating most electronic circuits.\n\n[[Semiconductor device]]s can display a range of useful properties such as passing current more easily in one direction than the other, showing variable resistance, and sensitivity to light or heat. Because the electrical properties of a semiconductor material can be modified by doping, or by the application of electrical fields or light, devices made from semiconductors can be used for amplification, switching, and [[energy conversion]].\n\nThe conductivity of silicon is increased by adding a small amount (of the order of 1 in 10<sup>8</sup>) of pentavalent ([[antimony]], [[phosphorus]], or [[arsenic]]) or trivalent ([[boron]], [[gallium]], [[indium]]) atoms. This process is known as doping and resulting semiconductors are known as doped or extrinsic semiconductors. Apart from doping, the conductivity of a semiconductor can equally be improved by increasing its temperature. This is contrary to the behaviour of a metal in which conductivity decreases with increase in temperature.\n\nThe modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies on [[quantum physics]] to explain the movement of charge carriers in a [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]].<ref name=Feynman>{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=Richard|title=Feynman Lectures on Physics|date=1963|publisher=Basic Books}}</ref>  Doping greatly increases the number of charge carriers within the crystal. When a doped semiconductor contains mostly free holes it is called \"[[extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type]]\", and when it contains mostly free electrons it is known as \"[[extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|n-type]]\". The semiconductor materials used in electronic devices are doped under precise conditions to control the concentration and regions of p- and n-type dopants. A single semiconductor crystal can have many p- and n-type regions; the [[p\u2013n junction]]s between these regions are responsible for the useful electronic behavior.\n\nSome of the properties of semiconductor materials were observed throughout the mid 19th and first decades of the 20th century. The first practical application of semiconductors in electronics was the 1904 development of the [[cat's-whisker detector]], a primitive semiconductor diode used in early radio receivers. Developments in quantum physics in turn led to the development of the [[transistor]] in 1947,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shockley|first1=William|title=Electrons and holes in semiconductors : with applications to transistor electronics|date=1950|publisher=R.

There are several developed techniques that allow semiconducting materials to behave like conducting materials, such as [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or [[field effect (semiconductor)|gating]]. These modifications have two outcomes: n-type and p-type. These refer to the excess or shortage of electrons, respectively. An unbalanced number of electrons would cause a current to flow through the material.<ref name=Neamen>{{cite web|last1=Neamen|first1=Donald|title=Semiconductor Physics and Devices|url=http://www.fulviofrisone.com/attachments/article/403/Semiconductor%20Physics%20And%20Devices%20-%20Donald%20Neamen.pdf|publisher=Elizabeth A. Jones}}</ref>\n;Heterojunctions\n:[[Heterojunctions]] occur when two differently doped semiconducting materials are joined together. For example, a configuration could consist of p-doped and n-doped [[germanium]]. This results in an exchange of electrons and holes between the differently doped semiconducting materials. The n-doped germanium would have an excess of electrons, and the p-doped germanium would have an excess of holes. The transfer occurs until equilibrium is reached by a process called [[recombination (physics)|recombination]], which causes the migrating electrons from the n-type to come in contact with the migrating holes from the p-type. A product of this process is charged [[ion]]s, which result in an [[electric field]].<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n;Excited electrons\n:A difference in electric potential on a semiconducting material would cause it to leave thermal equilibrium and create a non-equilibrium situation. This introduces electrons and holes to the system, which interact via a process called [[ambipolar diffusion]]. Whenever thermal equilibrium is disturbed in a semiconducting material, the number of holes and electrons changes. Such disruptions can occur as a result of a temperature difference or [[photon]]s, which can enter the system and create electrons and holes. The process that creates and annihilates electrons and holes are called [[Carrier generation and recombination|generation]] and [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombination]].<ref name=Neamen />\n;Light emission\n:In certain semiconductors, excited electrons can relax by emitting light instead of producing heat.<ref>By Abdul Al-Azzawi. \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=Iw7NBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA54&lpg=PA54&dq=In+certain+semiconductors,+excited+electrons+can+relax+by+emitting+light+instead+of+producing+heat.%5C&source=bl&ots=W0PTjQvQ2L&sig=ukjN-RIXvTMjjbhYd9QRxK14sd4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjMncyJmqjLAhVBxWMKHWuiBy0Q6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q&f=false Light and Optics: Principles and Practices].\" 2007.

Yacobi, ''Semiconductor Materials: An Introduction to Basic Principles'', Springer 2003 {{ISBN|0-306-47361-5}}, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n* Certain pure elements are found in [[Group 14 elements|Group 14]] of the [[periodic table]]; the most commercially important of these elements are [[silicon]] and [[germanium]]. Silicon and germanium are used here effectively because they have 4 valence electrons in their outermost shell which gives them the ability to gain or lose electrons equally at the same time.\n* Binary compounds, particularly between elements in Groups 13 and 15, such as [[gallium arsenide]], Groups 12 and 16, groups 14 and 16, and between different group 14 elements, e.g. [[silicon carbide]].\n* Certain ternary compounds, oxides and alloys.\n* [[Organic semiconductor]]s, made of [[organic compound]]s.\n\nMost common semiconducting materials are crystalline solids, but [[Amorphous silicon|amorphous]] and liquid semiconductors are also known. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and mixtures of [[arsenic]], [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] in a variety of proportions. These compounds share with better known semiconductors the properties of intermediate conductivity and a rapid variation of conductivity with temperature, as well as occasional [[negative resistance]]. Such disordered materials lack the rigid crystalline structure of conventional semiconductors such as silicon. They are generally used in [[thin film]] structures, which do not require material of higher electronic quality, being relatively insensitive to impurities and radiation damage.\n\n===Preparation of semiconductor materials===\n\nAlmost all of today's electronic technology involves the use of semiconductors, with the most important aspect being the [[integrated circuit]] (IC), which are found in [[Laptop computer|laptops]], scanners, [[cell-phone]]s, etc. Semiconductors for ICs are mass-produced. To create an ideal semiconducting material, chemical purity is paramount. Any small imperfection can have a drastic effect on how the semiconducting material behaves due to the scale at which the materials are used.<ref name=Neamen />\n\nA high degree of crystalline perfection is also required, since faults in crystal structure (such as [[dislocation]]s, [[Crystal twinning|twins]], and [[Crystallographic defect#Planar defects|stacking faults]]) interfere with the semiconducting properties of the material. Crystalline faults are a major cause of defective semiconductor devices. The larger the crystal, the more difficult it is to achieve the necessary perfection. Current mass production processes use crystal [[ingot]]s between {{convert|100|and|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter which are grown as cylinders and sliced into [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]].\n\nThere is a combination of processes that is used to prepare semiconducting materials for ICs. One process is called [[thermal oxidation]], which forms [[silicon dioxide]] on the surface of the [[silicon]]. This is used as a [[gate dielectric|gate insulator]] and [[LOCOS|field oxide]]. Other processes are called [[photomask]]s and [[photolithography]]. This process is what creates the patterns on the circuity in the integrated circuit. [[Ultraviolet light]] is used along with a [[photoresist]] layer to create a chemical change that generates the patterns for the circuit.<ref name=Neamen />\n\nEtching is the next process that is required. The part of the silicon that was not covered by the [[photoresist]] layer from the previous step can now be etched. The main process typically used today is called [[plasma etching]]. Plasma etching usually involves an [[plasma etching|etch gas]] pumped in a low-pressure chamber to create [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. A common etch gas is [[chlorofluorocarbon]], or more commonly known [[Freon]]. A high [[radio-frequency]] [[voltage]] between the [[cathode]] and [[anode]] is what creates the plasma in the chamber. The [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]] is located on the cathode, which causes it to be hit by the positively charged ions that are released from the plasma. The end result is silicon that is etched [[anisotropy|anisotropically]].<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n\nThe last process is called [[doping (semiconductor)|diffusion]]. This is the process that gives the semiconducting material its desired semiconducting properties. It is also known as [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]. The process introduces an impure atom to the system, which creates the [[p-n junction]]. In order to get the impure atoms embedded in the silicon wafer, the wafer is first put in a 1,100 degree Celsius chamber. The atoms are injected in and eventually diffuse with the silicon. After the process is completed and the silicon has reached room temperature, the doping process is done and the semiconducting material is ready to be used in an integrated circuit.<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n\n==Physics of semiconductors==\n\n===Energy bands and electrical conduction===\n\n{{main article|Electronic band structure|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n\n{{Band structure filling diagram}}\n\nSemiconductors are defined by their unique electric conductive behavior, somewhere between that of a conductor and an insulator.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fundamentals of Semiconductors|last = Yu|first = Peter|publisher = Springer-Verlag|year = 2010|isbn = 978-3-642-00709-5|location = Berlin|pages = }}</ref>\nThe differences between these materials can be understood in terms of the [[quantum state]]s for electrons, each of which may contain zero or one electron (by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]). These states are associated with the [[electronic band structure]] of the material.\n[[Electrical conductivity]] arises due to the presence of electrons in states that are [[delocalized electron|delocalized]] (extending through the material), however in order to transport electrons a state must be ''partially filled'', containing an electron only part of the time.<ref>As in the Mott formula for conductivity, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Cutler | first1 = M. | last2 = Mott | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.181.1336 | title = Observation of Anderson Localization in an Electron Gas | journal = Physical Review | volume = 181 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336 | year = 1969 | pmid = | pmc = |bibcode = 1969PhRv..181.1336C }}</ref> If the state is always occupied with an electron, then it is inert, blocking the passage of other electrons via that state.\nThe energies of these quantum states are critical, since a state is partially filled only if its energy is near the [[Fermi level]] (see [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]]).\n\nHigh conductivity in a material comes from it having many partially filled states and much state delocalization.\nMetals are good [[electrical conductor]]s and have many partially filled states with energies near their Fermi level.\n[[Insulator (electricity)|Insulators]], by contrast, have few partially filled states, their Fermi levels sit within [[band gap]]s with few energy states to occupy.\nImportantly, an insulator can be made to conduct by increasing its temperature: heating provides energy to promote some electrons across the band gap, inducing partially filled states in both the band of states beneath the band gap ([[valence band]]) and the band of states above the band gap ([[conduction band]]).\nAn (intrinsic) semiconductor has a band gap that is smaller than that of an insulator and at room temperature significant numbers of electrons can be excited to cross the band gap.<ref name=\"Kittel\">[[Charles Kittel]] (1995) ''Introduction to Solid State Physics'', 7th ed. Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-11181-3}}.</ref>\n\nA pure semiconductor, however, is not very useful, as it is neither a very good insulator nor a very good conductor.\nHowever, one important feature of semiconductors (and some insulators, known as ''semi-insulators'') is that their conductivity can be increased and controlled by [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] with impurities and [[field effect (semiconductor)|gating]] with electric fields. Doping and gating move either the conduction or valence band much closer to the Fermi level, and greatly increase the number of partially filled states.\n\nSome [[Wide-bandgap semiconductor|wider-band gap semiconductor]] materials are sometimes referred to as '''semi-insulators'''. When undoped, these have electrical conductivity nearer to that of electrical insulators, however they can be doped (making them as useful as semiconductors). Semi-insulators find niche applications in micro-electronics, such as substrates for [[High-electron-mobility transistor|HEMT]]. An example of a common semi-insulator is [[gallium arsenide]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=J. W. Allen|title=Gallium Arsenide as a semi-insulator|journal=Nature|volume= 187|pages=403\u201305|year=1960|doi=10.1038/187403b0|bibcode = 1960Natur.187..403A|issue=4735}}</ref> Some materials, such as [[titanium dioxide]], can even be used as insulating materials for some applications, while being treated as wide-gap semiconductors for other applications.\n\n===Charge carriers (electrons and holes)===\n\n{{main article|Electron hole}}\n\nThe partial filling of the states at the bottom of the conduction band can be understood as adding electrons to that band.\nThe electrons do not stay indefinitely (due to the natural thermal [[recombination (physics)|recombination]]) but they can move around for some time.\nThe actual concentration of electrons is typically very dilute, and so (unlike in metals) it is possible to think of the electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor as a sort of classical [[ideal gas]], where the electrons fly around freely without being subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. In most semiconductors the conduction bands have a parabolic [[dispersion relation]], and so these electrons respond to forces (electric field, magnetic field, etc.) much like they would in a vacuum, though with a different [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]].<ref name=\"Kittel\"/>\nBecause the electrons behave like an ideal gas, one may also think about conduction in very simplistic terms such as the [[Drude model]], and introduce concepts such as [[electron mobility]].\n\nFor partial filling at the top of the valence band, it is helpful to introduce the concept of an [[electron hole]].\nAlthough the electrons in the valence band are always moving around, a completely full valence band is inert, not conducting any current.\nIf an electron is taken out of the valence band, then the trajectory that the electron would normally have taken is now missing its charge.\nFor the purposes of electric current, this combination of the full valence band, minus the electron, can be converted into a picture of a completely empty band containing a positively charged particle that moves in the same way as the electron.\nCombined with the ''negative'' effective mass of the electrons at the top of the valence band, we arrive at a picture of a positively charged particle that responds to electric and magnetic fields just as a normal positively charged particle would do in vacuum, again with some positive effective mass.<ref name=\"Kittel\"/>\nThis particle is called a hole, and the collection of holes in the valence band can again be understood in simple classical terms (as with the electrons in the conduction band).\n\n====Carrier generation and recombination====\n{{main article|Carrier generation and recombination}}\n\nWhen [[ionizing radiation]] strikes a semiconductor, it may excite an electron out of its energy level and consequently leave a hole. This process is known as [[carrier generation and recombination|''electron\u2013hole pair generation'']]. Electron-hole pairs are constantly generated from [[thermal energy]] as well, in the absence of any external energy source.\n\nElectron-hole pairs are also apt to recombine. [[Conservation of energy]] demands that these recombination events, in which an electron loses an amount of [[energy]] larger than the [[band gap]], be accompanied by the emission of thermal energy (in the form of [[phonon]]s) or radiation (in the form of [[photon]]s).\n\nIn some states, the generation and recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs are in equipoise. The number of electron-hole pairs in the [[steady state]] at a given temperature is determined by [[quantum statistical mechanics]]. The precise [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] mechanisms of generation and recombination are governed by [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum]].\n\nAs the probability that electrons and holes meet together is proportional to the product of their numbers, the product is in steady state nearly constant at a given temperature, providing that there is no significant electric field (which might \"flush\" carriers of both types, or move them from neighbour regions containing more of them to meet together) or externally driven pair generation. The product is a function of the temperature, as the probability of getting enough thermal energy to produce a pair increases with temperature, being approximately exp(\u2212''E''<sub>''G''</sub>/''kT''), where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is absolute temperature and ''E''<sub>''G''</sub> is band gap.\n\nThe probability of meeting is increased by carrier traps&nbsp;\u2013 impurities or dislocations which can trap an electron or hole and hold it until a pair is completed. Such carrier traps are sometimes purposely added to reduce the time needed to reach the steady state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Louis Nashelsky|first1=Robert L.Boylestad|title=Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory|publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Private Limited|location=India|isbn=978-81-203-2967-6|pages=7\u201310|edition=9th}}</ref>\n\n===Doping===\n{{main article|Doping (semiconductor)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nThe conductivity of semiconductors may easily be modified by introducing impurities into their [[crystal lattice]]. The process of adding controlled impurities to a semiconductor is known as ''doping''. The amount of impurity, or dopant, added to an ''[[intrinsic semiconductor|intrinsic]]'' (pure) semiconductor varies its level of conductivity. Doped semiconductors are referred to as [[Extrinsic semiconductor|''extrinsic'']]. By adding impurity to the pure semiconductors, the electrical conductivity may be varied by factors of thousands or millions.\n\nA 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> specimen of a metal or semiconductor has of the order of 10<sup>22</sup> atoms. In a metal, every atom donates at least one free electron for conduction, thus 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of metal contains on the order of 10<sup>22</sup> free electrons, whereas a 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> sample of pure germanium at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C contains about {{val|4.2|e=22}} atoms, but only {{val|2.5|e=13}} free electrons and {{val|2.5|e=13}} holes. The addition of 0.001% of arsenic (an impurity) donates an extra 10<sup>17</sup> free electrons in the same volume and the electrical conductivity is increased by a factor of 10,000.\n\nThe materials chosen as suitable dopants depend on the atomic properties of both the dopant and the material to be doped. In general, dopants that produce the desired controlled changes are classified as either electron [[Acceptor (semiconductors)|acceptors]] or [[Donor (semiconductors)|donors]]. Semiconductors doped with ''donor'' impurities are called ''n-type'', while those doped with ''acceptor'' impurities are known as ''p-type''. The n and p type designations indicate which charge carrier acts as the material's [[majority carrier]]. The opposite carrier is called the [[minority carrier]], which exists due to thermal excitation at a much lower concentration compared to the majority carrier.\n\nFor example, the pure semiconductor [[silicon]] has four valence electrons which bond each silicon atom to its neighbors. In silicon, the most common dopants are ''group III'' and ''group V'' elements. Group III elements all contain three valence electrons, causing them to function as acceptors when used to dope silicon. When an acceptor atom replaces a silicon atom in the crystal, a vacant state (an electron \"hole\") is created, which can move around the lattice and functions as a charge carrier. Group V elements have five valence electrons, which allows them to act as a donor; substitution of these atoms for silicon creates an extra free electron. Therefore, a silicon crystal doped with [[boron]] creates a p-type semiconductor whereas one doped with [[phosphorus]] results in an n-type material.\n\nDuring [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacture]], dopants can be diffused into the semiconductor body by contact with gaseous compounds of the desired element, or [[ion implantation]] can be used to accurately position the doped regions.\n\n===Amorphous semiconductors===\nSome materials, when rapidly cooled to a glassy amorphous state, have semiconducting properties. These include B, [[amorphous silicon|Si]], Ge, Se, and Te, and there are multiple theories to explain them.<ref>[http://techdigest.jhuapl.edu/views/pdfs/V07_N3_1968/V7_N3_1968_Feldman.pdf ''Amorphous semiconductors'' 1968]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Amorphous semiconductors: a review of current theories|first1=K.|last1=Hulls|first2=P.

Thomson]] in 1897 prompted theories of electron-based conduction in solids. [[Karl Baedeker (scientist)|Karl Baedeker]], by observing a Hall effect with the reverse sign to that in metals, theorized that copper iodide had positive charge carriers.

Schottky]] and [[Nevill Francis Mott]] developed models of the potential barrier and of the characteristics of a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]]. By 1938, Boris Davydov had developed a theory of the copper-oxide rectifier, identifying the effect of the [[p\u2013n junction]] and the importance of minority carriers and surface states.<ref name=Morris90/>\n\nAgreement between theoretical predictions (based on developing quantum mechanics) and experimental results was sometimes poor.

This spurred the development of improved material refining techniques, culminating in modern semiconductor refineries producing materials with parts-per-trillion purity.\n\nDevices using semiconductors were at first constructed based on empirical knowledge, before semiconductor theory provided a guide to construction of more capable and reliable devices.\n\n[[Alexander Graham Bell]] used the light-sensitive property of selenium to [[Photophone|transmit sound]] over a beam of light in 1880.

These devices were used for detecting ships and aircraft, for infrared rangefinders, and for voice communication systems. The point-contact crystal detector became vital for microwave radio systems, since available vacuum tube devices could not serve as detectors above about 4000&nbsp;MHz; advanced radar systems relied on the fast response of crystal detectors. Considerable research and development of [[silicon]] materials occurred during the war to develop detectors of consistent quality.<ref name=Morris90/>\n\n===Early transistors===\n{{Main|History of the transistor}}\n[[File:Bardeen Shockley Brattain 1948.JPG|thumb|[[John Bardeen]], [[William Shockley]] and [[Walter Brattain]] developed the bipolar [[point-contact transistor]] in 1947.]]\n\nDetector and power rectifiers could not amplify a signal. Many efforts were made to develop a solid-state amplifier and were successful in developing a device called the [[point contact transistor]] which could amplify 20db or more.<ref name=Morris90/> In 1922, [[Oleg Losev]] developed two-terminal, [[negative resistance]] amplifiers for radio, but he perished in the [[Siege of Leningrad]] after successful completion. In 1926, [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] patented a device resembling a [[field-effect transistor]], but it was not practical. R. Hilsch and R. W. Pohl in 1938 demonstrated a solid-state amplifier using a structure resembling the control grid of a vacuum tube; although the device displayed power gain, it had a [[cut-off frequency]] of one cycle per second, too low for any practical applications, but an effective application of the available theory.<ref name=Morris90/> At [[Bell Labs]], [[William Shockley]] and A. Holden started investigating solid-state amplifiers in 1938. The first p\u2013n junction in silicon was observed by [[Russell Ohl]] about 1941, when a specimen was found to be light-sensitive, with a sharp boundary between p-type impurity at one end and n-type at the other. A slice cut from the specimen at the p\u2013n boundary developed a voltage when exposed to light.\n\nThe first working [[transistor]] was a [[point-contact transistor]] invented by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Houser Brattain]] and [[William Shockley]] at Bell Labs in 1947.

Its [[electrical resistance|resistance]] falls as its temperature rises; metals are the opposite. Its conducting properties may be altered in useful ways by introducing impurities (\"[[Doping (semiconductor)|doping]]\") into the [[crystal structure]]. When two differently-doped regions exist in the same crystal, a [[semiconductor junction]] is created. The behavior of [[charge carrier]]s which include [[electron]]s, [[ion]]s and [[electron hole]]s at these junctions is the basis of [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s and all modern [[electronics]]. Some examples of semiconductors are [[silicon]], [[germanium]], [[gallium arsenide]], and elements near the so-called \"[[metalloid staircase]]\" on the periodic table. After silicon, gallium arsenide is the second most common semiconductor{{cn|date=October 2018}} and is used in laser diodes, solar cells, microwave-frequency integrated circuits and others. Silicon is a critical element for fabricating most electronic circuits.\n\n[[Semiconductor device]]s can display a range of useful properties such as passing current more easily in one direction than the other, showing variable resistance, and sensitivity to light or heat. Because the electrical properties of a semiconductor material can be modified by doping, or by the application of electrical fields or light, devices made from semiconductors can be used for amplification, switching, and [[energy conversion]].\n\nThe conductivity of silicon is increased by adding a small amount (of the order of 1 in 10<sup>8</sup>) of pentavalent ([[antimony]], [[phosphorus]], or [[arsenic]]) or trivalent ([[boron]], [[gallium]], [[indium]]) atoms. This process is known as doping and resulting semiconductors are known as doped or extrinsic semiconductors. Apart from doping, the conductivity of a semiconductor can equally be improved by increasing its temperature. This is contrary to the behaviour of a metal in which conductivity decreases with increase in temperature.\n\nThe modern understanding of the properties of a semiconductor relies on [[quantum physics]] to explain the movement of charge carriers in a [[crystal structure|crystal lattice]].<ref name=Feynman>{{cite book|last1=Feynman|first1=Richard|title=Feynman Lectures on Physics|date=1963|publisher=Basic Books}}</ref>  Doping greatly increases the number of charge carriers within the crystal. When a doped semiconductor contains mostly free holes it is called \"[[extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type]]\", and when it contains mostly free electrons it is known as \"[[extrinsic semiconductor#N-type semiconductors|n-type]]\". The semiconductor materials used in electronic devices are doped under precise conditions to control the concentration and regions of p- and n-type dopants. A single semiconductor crystal can have many p- and n-type regions; the [[p\u2013n junction]]s between these regions are responsible for the useful electronic behavior.\n\nSome of the properties of semiconductor materials were observed throughout the mid 19th and first decades of the 20th century. The first practical application of semiconductors in electronics was the 1904 development of the [[cat's-whisker detector]], a primitive semiconductor diode used in early radio receivers. Developments in quantum physics in turn led to the development of the [[transistor]] in 1947,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shockley|first1=William|title=Electrons and holes in semiconductors : with applications to transistor electronics|date=1950|publisher=R.

There are several developed techniques that allow semiconducting materials to behave like conducting materials, such as [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] or [[field effect (semiconductor)|gating]]. These modifications have two outcomes: n-type and p-type. These refer to the excess or shortage of electrons, respectively. An unbalanced number of electrons would cause a current to flow through the material.<ref name=Neamen>{{cite web|last1=Neamen|first1=Donald|title=Semiconductor Physics and Devices|url=http://www.fulviofrisone.com/attachments/article/403/Semiconductor%20Physics%20And%20Devices%20-%20Donald%20Neamen.pdf|publisher=Elizabeth A. Jones}}</ref>\n;Heterojunctions\n:[[Heterojunctions]] occur when two differently doped semiconducting materials are joined together. For example, a configuration could consist of p-doped and n-doped [[germanium]]. This results in an exchange of electrons and holes between the differently doped semiconducting materials. The n-doped germanium would have an excess of electrons, and the p-doped germanium would have an excess of holes. The transfer occurs until equilibrium is reached by a process called [[recombination (physics)|recombination]], which causes the migrating electrons from the n-type to come in contact with the migrating holes from the p-type. A product of this process is charged [[ion]]s, which result in an [[electric field]].<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n;Excited electrons\n:A difference in electric potential on a semiconducting material would cause it to leave thermal equilibrium and create a non-equilibrium situation. This introduces electrons and holes to the system, which interact via a process called [[ambipolar diffusion]]. Whenever thermal equilibrium is disturbed in a semiconducting material, the number of holes and electrons changes. Such disruptions can occur as a result of a temperature difference or [[photon]]s, which can enter the system and create electrons and holes.

Yacobi, ''Semiconductor Materials: An Introduction to Basic Principles'', Springer 2003 {{ISBN|0-306-47361-5}}, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n* Certain pure elements are found in [[Group 14 elements|Group 14]] of the [[periodic table]]; the most commercially important of these elements are [[silicon]] and [[germanium]]. Silicon and germanium are used here effectively because they have 4 valence electrons in their outermost shell which gives them the ability to gain or lose electrons equally at the same time.\n* Binary compounds, particularly between elements in Groups 13 and 15, such as [[gallium arsenide]], Groups 12 and 16, groups 14 and 16, and between different group 14 elements, e.g. [[silicon carbide]].\n* Certain ternary compounds, oxides and alloys.\n* [[Organic semiconductor]]s, made of [[organic compound]]s.\n\nMost common semiconducting materials are crystalline solids, but [[Amorphous silicon|amorphous]] and liquid semiconductors are also known. These include [[hydrogenated amorphous silicon]] and mixtures of [[arsenic]], [[selenium]] and [[tellurium]] in a variety of proportions. These compounds share with better known semiconductors the properties of intermediate conductivity and a rapid variation of conductivity with temperature, as well as occasional [[negative resistance]]. Such disordered materials lack the rigid crystalline structure of conventional semiconductors such as silicon. They are generally used in [[thin film]] structures, which do not require material of higher electronic quality, being relatively insensitive to impurities and radiation damage.\n\n===Preparation of semiconductor materials===\n\nAlmost all of today's electronic technology involves the use of semiconductors, with the most important aspect being the [[integrated circuit]] (IC), which are found in [[Laptop computer|laptops]], scanners, [[cell-phone]]s, etc. Semiconductors for ICs are mass-produced. To create an ideal semiconducting material, chemical purity is paramount. Any small imperfection can have a drastic effect on how the semiconducting material behaves due to the scale at which the materials are used.<ref name=Neamen />\n\nA high degree of crystalline perfection is also required, since faults in crystal structure (such as [[dislocation]]s, [[Crystal twinning|twins]], and [[Crystallographic defect#Planar defects|stacking faults]]) interfere with the semiconducting properties of the material. Crystalline faults are a major cause of defective semiconductor devices. The larger the crystal, the more difficult it is to achieve the necessary perfection. Current mass production processes use crystal [[ingot]]s between {{convert|100|and|300|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter which are grown as cylinders and sliced into [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]].\n\nThere is a combination of processes that is used to prepare semiconducting materials for ICs. One process is called [[thermal oxidation]], which forms [[silicon dioxide]] on the surface of the [[silicon]]. This is used as a [[gate dielectric|gate insulator]] and [[LOCOS|field oxide]]. Other processes are called [[photomask]]s and [[photolithography]]. This process is what creates the patterns on the circuity in the integrated circuit. [[Ultraviolet light]] is used along with a [[photoresist]] layer to create a chemical change that generates the patterns for the circuit.<ref name=Neamen />\n\nEtching is the next process that is required. The part of the silicon that was not covered by the [[photoresist]] layer from the previous step can now be etched. The main process typically used today is called [[plasma etching]]. Plasma etching usually involves an [[plasma etching|etch gas]] pumped in a low-pressure chamber to create [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. A common etch gas is [[chlorofluorocarbon]], or more commonly known [[Freon]]. A high [[radio-frequency]] [[voltage]] between the [[cathode]] and [[anode]] is what creates the plasma in the chamber. The [[wafer (electronics)|silicon wafer]] is located on the cathode, which causes it to be hit by the positively charged ions that are released from the plasma. The end result is silicon that is etched [[anisotropy|anisotropically]].<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n\nThe last process is called [[doping (semiconductor)|diffusion]]. This is the process that gives the semiconducting material its desired semiconducting properties. It is also known as [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]]. The process introduces an impure atom to the system, which creates the [[p-n junction]]. In order to get the impure atoms embedded in the silicon wafer, the wafer is first put in a 1,100 degree Celsius chamber. The atoms are injected in and eventually diffuse with the silicon. After the process is completed and the silicon has reached room temperature, the doping process is done and the semiconducting material is ready to be used in an integrated circuit.<ref name=Feynman /><ref name=Neamen />\n\n==Physics of semiconductors==\n\n===Energy bands and electrical conduction===\n\n{{main article|Electronic band structure|Electrical resistivity and conductivity}}\n\n{{Band structure filling diagram}}\n\nSemiconductors are defined by their unique electric conductive behavior, somewhere between that of a conductor and an insulator.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Fundamentals of Semiconductors|last = Yu|first = Peter|publisher = Springer-Verlag|year = 2010|isbn = 978-3-642-00709-5|location = Berlin|pages = }}</ref>\nThe differences between these materials can be understood in terms of the [[quantum state]]s for electrons, each of which may contain zero or one electron (by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]). These states are associated with the [[electronic band structure]] of the material.\n[[Electrical conductivity]] arises due to the presence of electrons in states that are [[delocalized electron|delocalized]] (extending through the material), however in order to transport electrons a state must be ''partially filled'', containing an electron only part of the time.<ref>As in the Mott formula for conductivity, see {{Cite journal | last1 = Cutler | first1 = M. | last2 = Mott | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.181.1336 | title = Observation of Anderson Localization in an Electron Gas | journal = Physical Review | volume = 181 | issue = 3 | pages = 1336 | year = 1969 | pmid = | pmc = |bibcode = 1969PhRv..181.1336C }}</ref> If the state is always occupied with an electron, then it is inert, blocking the passage of other electrons via that state.\nThe energies of these quantum states are critical, since a state is partially filled only if its energy is near the [[Fermi level]] (see [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]]).\n\nHigh conductivity in a material comes from it having many partially filled states and much state delocalization.\nMetals are good [[electrical conductor]]s and have many partially filled states with energies near their Fermi level.\n[[Insulator (electricity)|Insulators]], by contrast, have few partially filled states, their Fermi levels sit within [[band gap]]s with few energy states to occupy.\nImportantly, an insulator can be made to conduct by increasing its temperature: heating provides energy to promote some electrons across the band gap, inducing partially filled states in both the band of states beneath the band gap ([[valence band]]) and the band of states above the band gap ([[conduction band]]).\nAn (intrinsic) semiconductor has a band gap that is smaller than that of an insulator and at room temperature significant numbers of electrons can be excited to cross the band gap.<ref name=\"Kittel\">[[Charles Kittel]] (1995) ''Introduction to Solid State Physics'', 7th ed. Wiley, {{ISBN|0-471-11181-3}}.</ref>\n\nA pure semiconductor, however, is not very useful, as it is neither a very good insulator nor a very good conductor.\nHowever, one important feature of semiconductors (and some insulators, known as ''semi-insulators'') is that their conductivity can be increased and controlled by [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] with impurities and [[field effect (semiconductor)|gating]] with electric fields. Doping and gating move either the conduction or valence band much closer to the Fermi level, and greatly increase the number of partially filled states.\n\nSome [[Wide-bandgap semiconductor|wider-band gap semiconductor]] materials are sometimes referred to as '''semi-insulators'''. When undoped, these have electrical conductivity nearer to that of electrical insulators, however they can be doped (making them as useful as semiconductors). Semi-insulators find niche applications in micro-electronics, such as substrates for [[High-electron-mobility transistor|HEMT]]. An example of a common semi-insulator is [[gallium arsenide]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=J. W. Allen|title=Gallium Arsenide as a semi-insulator|journal=Nature|volume= 187|pages=403\u201305|year=1960|doi=10.1038/187403b0|bibcode = 1960Natur.187..403A|issue=4735}}</ref> Some materials, such as [[titanium dioxide]], can even be used as insulating materials for some applications, while being treated as wide-gap semiconductors for other applications.\n\n===Charge carriers (electrons and holes)===\n\n{{main article|Electron hole}}\n\nThe partial filling of the states at the bottom of the conduction band can be understood as adding electrons to that band.\nThe electrons do not stay indefinitely (due to the natural thermal [[recombination (physics)|recombination]]) but they can move around for some time.\nThe actual concentration of electrons is typically very dilute, and so (unlike in metals) it is possible to think of the electrons in the conduction band of a semiconductor as a sort of classical [[ideal gas]], where the electrons fly around freely without being subject to the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]. In most semiconductors the conduction bands have a parabolic [[dispersion relation]], and so these electrons respond to forces (electric field, magnetic field, etc.) much like they would in a vacuum, though with a different [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]].<ref name=\"Kittel\"/>\nBecause the electrons behave like an ideal gas, one may also think about conduction in very simplistic terms such as the [[Drude model]], and introduce concepts such as [[electron mobility]].\n\nFor partial filling at the top of the valence band, it is helpful to introduce the concept of an [[electron hole]].\nAlthough the electrons in the valence band are always moving around, a completely full valence band is inert, not conducting any current.\nIf an electron is taken out of the valence band, then the trajectory that the electron would normally have taken is now missing its charge.\nFor the purposes of electric current, this combination of the full valence band, minus the electron, can be converted into a picture of a completely empty band containing a positively charged particle that moves in the same way as the electron.\nCombined with the ''negative'' effective mass of the electrons at the top of the valence band, we arrive at a picture of a positively charged particle that responds to electric and magnetic fields just as a normal positively charged particle would do in vacuum, again with some positive effective mass.<ref name=\"Kittel\"/>\nThis particle is called a hole, and the collection of holes in the valence band can again be understood in simple classical terms (as with the electrons in the conduction band).\n\n====Carrier generation and recombination====\n{{main article|Carrier generation and recombination}}\n\nWhen [[ionizing radiation]] strikes a semiconductor, it may excite an electron out of its energy level and consequently leave a hole. This process is known as [[carrier generation and recombination|''electron\u2013hole pair generation'']]. Electron-hole pairs are constantly generated from [[thermal energy]] as well, in the absence of any external energy source.\n\nElectron-hole pairs are also apt to recombine. [[Conservation of energy]] demands that these recombination events, in which an electron loses an amount of [[energy]] larger than the [[band gap]], be accompanied by the emission of thermal energy (in the form of [[phonon]]s) or radiation (in the form of [[photon]]s).\n\nIn some states, the generation and recombination of electron\u2013hole pairs are in equipoise. The number of electron-hole pairs in the [[steady state]] at a given temperature is determined by [[quantum statistical mechanics]]. The precise [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] mechanisms of generation and recombination are governed by [[conservation of energy]] and [[conservation of momentum]].\n\nAs the probability that electrons and holes meet together is proportional to the product of their numbers, the product is in steady state nearly constant at a given temperature, providing that there is no significant electric field (which might \"flush\" carriers of both types, or move them from neighbour regions containing more of them to meet together) or externally driven pair generation. The product is a function of the temperature, as the probability of getting enough thermal energy to produce a pair increases with temperature, being approximately exp(\u2212''E''<sub>''G''</sub>/''kT''), where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], ''T'' is absolute temperature and ''E''<sub>''G''</sub> is band gap.\n\nThe probability of meeting is increased by carrier traps&nbsp;\u2013 impurities or dislocations which can trap an electron or hole and hold it until a pair is completed. Such carrier traps are sometimes purposely added to reduce the time needed to reach the steady state.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Louis Nashelsky|first1=Robert L.Boylestad|title=Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory|publisher=Prentice-Hall of India Private Limited|location=India|isbn=978-81-203-2967-6|pages=7\u201310|edition=9th}}</ref>\n\n===Doping===\n{{main article|Doping (semiconductor)}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}\nThe conductivity of semiconductors may easily be modified by introducing impurities into their [[crystal lattice]]. The process of adding controlled impurities to a semiconductor is known as ''doping''. The amount of impurity, or dopant, added to an ''[[intrinsic semiconductor|intrinsic]]'' (pure) semiconductor varies its level of conductivity. Doped semiconductors are referred to as [[Extrinsic semiconductor|''extrinsic'']]. By adding impurity to the pure semiconductors, the electrical conductivity may be varied by factors of thousands or millions.\n\nA 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> specimen of a metal or semiconductor has of the order of 10<sup>22</sup> atoms. In a metal, every atom donates at least one free electron for conduction, thus 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> of metal contains on the order of 10<sup>22</sup> free electrons, whereas a 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> sample of pure germanium at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C contains about {{val|4.2|e=22}} atoms, but only {{val|2.5|e=13}} free electrons and {{val|2.5|e=13}} holes. The addition of 0.001% of arsenic (an impurity) donates an extra 10<sup>17</sup> free electrons in the same volume and the electrical conductivity is increased by a factor of 10,000.\n\nThe materials chosen as suitable dopants depend on the atomic properties of both the dopant and the material to be doped. In general, dopants that produce the desired controlled changes are classified as either electron [[Acceptor (semiconductors)|acceptors]] or [[Donor (semiconductors)|donors]]. Semiconductors doped with ''donor'' impurities are called ''n-type'', while those doped with ''acceptor'' impurities are known as ''p-type''. The n and p type designations indicate which charge carrier acts as the material's [[majority carrier]]. The opposite carrier is called the [[minority carrier]], which exists due to thermal excitation at a much lower concentration compared to the majority carrier.\n\nFor example, the pure semiconductor [[silicon]] has four valence electrons which bond each silicon atom to its neighbors. In silicon, the most common dopants are ''group III'' and ''group V'' elements. Group III elements all contain three valence electrons, causing them to function as acceptors when used to dope silicon. When an acceptor atom replaces a silicon atom in the crystal, a vacant state (an electron \"hole\") is created, which can move around the lattice and functions as a charge carrier. Group V elements have five valence electrons, which allows them to act as a donor; substitution of these atoms for silicon creates an extra free electron. Therefore, a silicon crystal doped with [[boron]] creates a p-type semiconductor whereas one doped with [[phosphorus]] results in an n-type material.\n\nDuring [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacture]], dopants can be diffused into the semiconductor body by contact with gaseous compounds of the desired element, or [[ion implantation]] can be used to accurately position the doped regions.\n\n===Amorphous semiconductors===\nSome materials, when rapidly cooled to a glassy amorphous state, have semiconducting properties. These include B, [[amorphous silicon|Si]], Ge, Se, and Te, and there are multiple theories to explain them.<ref>[http://techdigest.jhuapl.edu/views/pdfs/V07_N3_1968/V7_N3_1968_Feldman.pdf ''Amorphous semiconductors'' 1968]</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title=Amorphous semiconductors: a review of current theories|first1=K.|last1=Hulls|first2=P.

In 1873 [[Willoughby Smith]] observed that [[selenium]] [[resistor]]s exhibit decreasing resistance when light falls on them. In 1874, [[Karl Ferdinand Braun]] observed conduction and [[Rectifier|rectification]] in metallic [[sulfide]]s, although this effect had been discovered much earlier by Peter Munck af Rosenschold ([[:sv:Peter Munck af Rosensch\u00f6ld|sv]]) writing for the Annalen der Physik und Chemie in 1835,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rslXJmYPjGIC&pg=PA24&dq=Semiconductor+Rectifier+Rosenschold#v=onepage&q=Semiconductor+Rectifier+Rosenschold&f=false|title=A History of the World Semiconductor Industry|first=Peter Robin|last=Morris|date=July 22, 1990|publisher=IET|via=Google Books|isbn=9780863412271}}</ref> and [[Arthur Schuster]] found that a copper oxide layer on wires has rectification properties that ceases when the wires are cleaned.

Thomson]] in 1897 prompted theories of electron-based conduction in solids. [[Karl Baedeker (scientist)|Karl Baedeker]], by observing a Hall effect with the reverse sign to that in metals, theorized that copper iodide had positive charge carriers.

In 1930, B. Gudden stated that conductivity in semiconductors was due to minor concentrations of impurities. By 1931, the band theory of conduction had been established by [[Alan Herries Wilson]] and the concept of band gaps had been developed. [[Walter H. Schottky]] and [[Nevill Francis Mott]] developed models of the potential barrier and of the characteristics of a [[metal\u2013semiconductor junction]]. By 1938, Boris Davydov had developed a theory of the copper-oxide rectifier, identifying the effect of the [[p\u2013n junction]] and the importance of minority carriers and surface states.<ref name=Morris90/>\n\nAgreement between theoretical predictions (based on developing quantum mechanics) and experimental results was sometimes poor.

These devices were used for detecting ships and aircraft, for infrared rangefinders, and for voice communication systems. The point-contact crystal detector became vital for microwave radio systems, since available vacuum tube devices could not serve as detectors above about 4000&nbsp;MHz; advanced radar systems relied on the fast response of crystal detectors.

The character has been moderately popular since his introduction in 1965. Originally adventurer Rex Mason, he is converted into a man made of a shifting mass of chemicals after being cursed by an ancient artifact that he has retrieved.\n\n==Publication history==\nMetamorpho's creator, [[Bob Haney]], had seen success with DC Comics in 1963 with the titles ''[[Metal Men]]'' and ''[[Doom Patrol]]'', featuring bands of superheroes exhibiting fantastic powers. Under the editorial management of [[George Kashdan]], Haney was asked to capitalize on these titles' popularity with a similar character. Metamorpho, the Element Man, debuted in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #57 (January 1965).<ref>{{cite book| last= McAvennie |first= Michael| editor-last= Dolan| editor-first= Hannah |chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle| publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 114 |quote = Scribe Bob Haney and artist Ramona Fradon were truly in their element...Haney and Fradon's collaborative chemistry resulted in [Rex] Mason becoming Metamorpho.}}</ref>\n\nAs first conceived, Metamorpho was a parody of the fantastic characters that populated comic books in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book | last=Jones | first=Gerard |author2=Will Jacobs | title=The Comic Book Heroes | location=[[Rocklin, California]] | publisher=Prima Lifestyles | pages=76\u201377 | date=October 23, 1996 | isbn=978-0-7615-0393-4}}</ref> Artist [[Ramona Fradon]] was coaxed out of maternity retirement to illustrate Metamorpho's first appearances. The popularity of Metamorpho's appearances in ''The Brave and the Bold'' led to a 17-issue [[ongoing series]] between 1965 and 1968. Metamorpho also appeared during this time in two issues of ''Justice League of America'' (#42 and #44) and became the second superhero to decline an invitation to join that organization ([[Adam Strange]] being the first), though he did become a reservist, eventually being called in during a Justice League/Justice Society crossover to help find and rescue the Seven Soldiers of Victory.\n\nMetamorpho appears on the cover of ''Aquaman'' #30 as one of the pallbearers (along with Batman, Hawkman, and Superman) at the \"Sea King's Funeral\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://comicvine.gamespot.com/aquaman-30-the-death-of-aquaman/4000-108970/ |title=Aquaman #30 - The Death of Aquaman |website=Comic Vine |access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref> Metamorpho also appears in a series of backup stories in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #413\u2013418 and ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #218\u2013220 and #229.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Stroud|first = Bryan|title = Metamorpho in ''Action Comics'' |journal= [[Back Issue!]] |issue = 64 |pages = 22\u201327| publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date = May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Metamorpho appeared in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #3, a brief anthology series consisting of one-shots. That issue was written by Bob Haney and illustrated by Ramona Fradon, Metamorpho's creators. Haney and Fradon had met at the 1974 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], and while reminiscing, it emerged that both of them regarded Metamorpho as one of the features they'd most enjoyed working on, leading them to ask DC if they could do one more Metamorpho story together.<ref name=\"back71\">{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz |first= Jack| title= 1st Issue Special: It Was No ''Showcase'' (But It Was Never Meant To Be)| journal= [[Back Issue!]]| issue=71 |page= 42| publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date= April 2014 |location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Fradon later commented, \"I think we both felt that Metamorpho was our baby. I never had an experience like I had working with Bob Haney on ''Metamorpho''. It was like our minds were in perfect synch ... it was one of those wonderful collaborations that doesn't happen very often.\"<ref name=\"back71\"/>\n\nAfter becoming a charter member of the Outsiders in 1983, and member of the European branch of the [[Justice League International]], Metamorpho received his own four-issue mini-series in 1993.\n\nIn 2005, DC Comics reprinted Metamorpho's early ''The Brave and the Bold'' appearances and the entirety of the 1965 series as one of the company's volumes of ''[[Showcase Presents]]''.\n\nIn 2007, [[Dan Jurgens]] launched the six-issue series ''Metamorpho: Year One''.\n\nAs part of a ''[[Wednesday Comics]]'', [[Neil Gaiman]] wrote a 12-page Metamorpho story that [[Mike Allred]] illustrated.<ref>{{cite web | first= Remy | last= Minnick | url= http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=19775 | title=Gaiman & Allred on Metamorpho | work=[[Comic Book Resources]] | date=January 30, 2009 | accessdate=January 31, 2009}}</ref> In 2016 he starred in a new comic book series titled DC's ''Legends of Tomorrow''.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://comicvine.gamespot.com/articles/aaron-lopresti-talks-metamorpho-in-new-dcs-legends/1100-155102/ |title= Aaron Lopresti Talks Metamorpho in New DC's LEGENDS OF TOMORROW Series|work=Comic Vine |access-date= 2018-09-23|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nRex Mason is an adventurer who is hired by [[Stagg Enterprises]] CEO, [[Simon Stagg]], to retrieve a rare [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifact, the [[Orb of Ra]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Markstein |first1=Don |website=Don Markstein's Toonopedia |accessdate=2 April 2020  |url=http://www.toonopedia.com/metamor.htm |title=Metamorpho the Element Man}}</ref> Shortly after hiring him, Simon Stagg learns that Mason has been dating his daughter, [[Sapphire Stagg]]. This and other incidents begin to fuel in Stagg a dislike for Mason that ultimately leads to a plot to kill him.\n\nIn an [[Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid]], Rex Mason is knocked unconscious by Simon's brutish bodyguard [[Java (comics)|Java]] and is eventually exposed to a radioactive [[meteoroid|meteor]]ite from which the Orb of [[Ra]] was fashioned. A tremendous flare-up of its radiation transforms Mason into Metamorpho, the Element Man. He gains the ability to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] and change himself into any [[chemical element|element]] or combination of elements found in the human body. It is also established in his origin story in ''[[The Brave & The Bold]]'' #57 that Metamorpho is virtually invulnerable in his inert (untransformed) state, when Stagg, afraid that Rex is going to kill him, shoots him point-blank without effect. The Orb of Ra, however, has the same effect on Rex that [[kryptonite]] has on [[Superman]]. Thus Stagg continues to control Metamorpho using the Orb. Later, it is revealed that Mason is but one of many [[metamorphae]]. They were created by the sun god Ra, using the meteorite, to serve as warriors in his battle against the god [[Apep]], \"the serpent who never dies.\"<ref>{{cite book | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | last1=Beatty | first1=Scott | authorlink1=Scott Beatty | last2=Jimenez | first2=Phil | authorlink2=Phil Jimenez | date=October 4, 2004 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] Limited | isbn=978-0-7566-0592-6 | page=202}}</ref>\n\nMetamorpho, unlike most super-humanoids described in DC Comics, cannot assume a normal, fully human appearance, being no longer composed of flesh, blood and bone. As such, he regards his metamorphic powers as a disease and seeks a cure for his condition. Because he considers himself a freak and wishes only to be restored to his former human state, he rejects an offer of membership from the [[Justice League of America]] in ''JLA'' #42. [[Green Lantern]] attempts to change him back using his power ring, but due to a \"yellow\" component of the meteorite radiation, is unable to make him normal again.\n\nMetamorpho briefly has a crimefighting partner named Urania \"Rainie\" Blackwell, a woman who deliberately exposed herself to the Orb to gain its powers. She calls herself [[Element Girl]] (nicknamed \"the Chemical Doll\") and works with him on a number of cases.\n\nIssues #16\u201317 were intended to show a new direction for the series, with Sapphire marrying a man named Wally Bannister and Metamorpho joining a mysterious Mr. Shadow to deal with an immortal queen. Bent on world conquest, the queen (an exact lookalike of Sapphire) marries Metamorpho. She later steps outside her mystic city and instantly ages 2,000 years. When Wally Bannister is murdered by Algon (a metamorph who has lived for centuries in a depowered state), Metamorpho is [[frame-up|framed]]. Instead of coming to his defense against the false accusations, Metamorpho's colleague Mr. Shadow comes forth as an enemy. It is revealed that Mr. Shadow was attempting to enslave Metamorpho all along. Metamorpho is tried and convicted by a jury of rabble and is then executed by [[absolute zero]]; the first of what will become a series of multiple if temporary deaths.\n\nElement Girl revives Metamorpho, and Algon, the real murderer, is killed by molten lava minerals in an attempt to regain his burned-out powers. It is later learned that Mr. Bannister's murder was actually engineered by the villainous Prosecutor, who is then killed by an [[insectoid]] villain in a cocoon. At this point, issue #17 ends, and the story is never continued.\n\nMetamorpho reappears years later in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #101 (April\u2013May 1972). It is revealed that Metamorpho had spent the period after the end of his own series immersed in a painful chemical bath concocted by Stagg in an attempt to cure his condition. Stagg retrieves him from this \"cure\" too early because he needs Mason to save his endangered daughter Sapphire. Metamorpho stars in a new backup series beginning in ''Action'' #413 (June 1972). There is no reference in this revival series to the events or characters of his previous two issues.\n\nUrania Blackwell, unreferenced since the end of the regular series, is later revealed to have ended her partnership with Metamopho when her unrequited attraction to him became too much for her. Blackwell's powers are removed at her own request by Ra, resulting in her death; the episode, in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]],'' involves [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]]. Death mentions Algon's death in passing, trying to convince Blackwell that she will not live forever.\n\n===Outsiders===\nMetamorpho spends some time working with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. While in the [[despotism|despotically]] ruled nation Mozombia, Metamorpho is subdued and dissassembled. The tyrant's forces keep him inert with a constant application of radiation. He is freed by [[Katana (comics)|Katana's]] indestructible sword, which had been latched onto a live electrical wire. While leaving Mozombia, the Outsiders' plane is shot down by the [[Bad Samaritan]]. Metamorpho and the others spend some time stranded on a deserted island, simply too far away from land to rescue themselves.\n\nMetamorpho perishes for the second time during the ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'' event.<ref name= outsiders27>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Mike W. Barr|Barr, Mike W.]] | artist=[[Erik Larsen|Larsen, Erik]] | story= Robot Tyrants of Kadeyland! | title=The Outsiders | volume=1 | issue=27 | date=January 1988 | publisher=DC Comics}}</ref> Doctor Jace, the scientific adviser to the Outsiders, has decided that life with the more logical [[Manhunters (DC Comics)|Manhunters]] is preferable and she betrays the team; they fight back, but Metamorpho has been brainwashed into assisting Jace. He is killed in the resulting battle.<ref name=outsiders27/> He is again revived during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' miniseries, when a gene-bomb set off by invading aliens affects his biomass.\n\n===Justice League===\nMetamorpho spends some time with the Justice League, including [[Justice League Europe]]. During this period he encounters Sapphire Stagg again. He becomes involved in a battle with the [[Metal Men]], who have been tricked by Simon Stagg. His League friends, [[Dimitri Pushkin|Rocket Red]] and [[Animal Man]], are at the site of the battle, but are being detained by Java. At the conclusion of the battle, Metamorpho learns he had a son with Sapphire. Unfortunately, the baby boy's touch harms all but Sapphire and Metamorpho. When Java holds the baby, his arms melt. Metamorpho hands the baby over to Simon, who immediately fears he will be affected like Java was moments before and die. However, something in his genetic structure protects him, just as it did with Sasphire. Simon's stance softens and everyone is set free. [[Will Magnus|Doc Magnus]], the leader of the Metal Men, offers his services in creating new arms for Java. On the way home, Metamorpho's friends are puzzled as to how he knew Simon would be unaffected by the child. Metamorpho indicates that he hoped the baby would kill Simon.\n\nLater, Metamorpho has a romantic relationship with [[Crimson Fox]], which is cut short by her apparent murder. His personal investigation of the incident uncovers multiple layers of lies and deceit. During his time with the team, while fighting the planet-smashing aliens called The Family, Metamorpho is hit by a powerful energy blast that destroys his body. He quickly re-forms in a totally different look. He will sport this new look until his next demise.\n\n===Third death and return===\nWhen the [[Hyperclan]] attacked the Justice League of America's [[Justice League Watchtower|orbiting base]], destroying it, Metamorpho protects three of his teammates, [[Albert Rothstein|Nuklon]], [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], and the original [[Icemaiden]], in a giant, fluid filled ball. The intent is for them to survive reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The three make it, injured but alive, but Metamorpho does not. He is buried with solemn honors. He is temporarily resurrected by the wish-granting [[The Cathexis|Id]] (fundamentally flawed because the wisher, his son Joey, only wished for him to be ''back'' rather than to be ''alive''). Later, he is definitively brought back to life by Sapphire Stagg using the Orb of Ra to bring Metamorpho back to life, and he briefly joined the [[Doom Patrol]].\n\nShortly thereafter, an accident with one of Simon Stagg's experiments turns Simon, Sapphire, and Joey into an energy being, and causes Metamorpho to take on the form and personality of Java. \"Java\" kidnaps [[Black Canary]], asking for her help in rescuing the others. With Canary's help, he becomes Metamorpho again and manages to return the others to their normal forms.<ref>''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #51\u201352 (March\u2013April 2003)</ref>\n\n===Outsiders / \"Shift\"===\nAt the same time, Metamorpho has seemingly been appearing in the ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) series, but Rex Mason informs the team that their \"Metamorpho\" is a regrown fragment of his own body.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #7 (February 2004)</ref> Rex attempts to reassimilate his \"twin\", but the Outsiders convince him that the twin deserves the chance to lead his own life. This second Metamorpho chose the name \"Shift\" and develops a relationship with [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]]. When she dies, he becomes depressed over her death. After the events of ''[[One Year Later]]'', Shift willingly chooses to be reassimilated into Metamorpho, because he has killed several people. Rex steps in to fill Shift's position in the Outsiders. A full account of Shift's crimes is explained in the ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) Annual; he had inadvertently killed 44 people during [[Black Lightning]]'s escape from [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]].\n\nMetamorpho continues to serve on the Outsiders when [[Batman]] takes over, and after its further restructuring following Batman's apparent death. He is apparently killed yet again alongside the rest of the team in a satellite explosion orchestrated by [[Talia al Ghul]].<ref>''[[Batman Incorporated]]: Leviathan Strikes''</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nOn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, an August 2013 story reveals that the Outsiders are revealed to have survived. It is stated that Metamorpho was able to save the team by the same technique he previously used to rescue the Justice League during the Hyperclan's attack.<ref>''Batman Incorporated'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> He is also shown as one of the candidates for the new [[Justice League International]], but is ultimately not chosen.<ref>''Justice League International'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Metamorpho is featured on the news as an apparent example of the \"Superman Theory,\" is which the government is thought to bave been experimenting on humans to give them superpowers.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #3 (January 2018). DC Comics.</ref>\n\nMetamorpho is transmuted into Nth Metal by Simon Stagg as part of his plot to open the portal to the Dark Multiverse. While trying to get Simon Stagg to close the portal with the help of Plastic Man, Mister Terrific is sucked in to the portal with Plastic Man and Metamorpho. Plastic Man shields the others from the Dark Multiverse energy, which he is immune to. Upon arriving on a lifeless world they encounter Phantom Girl, who is been trapped in her intangible form and has no knowledge she has been sending a signal. When the four of them find a computer in the gut of a dead giant creature, they are greeted by a hologram of Tom Strong who states that they are needed to save the universe.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #1. DC Comics.</ref> Mister Terrific, Plastic Man, and Metamorpho learn from Phantom Girl that she has been stuck in intangible form since she was a child.

In the process of defeating him by using the Orb of Ra, Rex is turned human again.<ref>''The Terrifics'' #6. DC Comics. </ref> The Terrifics disband after learning that Java was Doctor Dread all along. Afterwards, Rex slowly comes to feel he is dull and worthless without his heroic role. On purpose, Rex and Element Dog sneak into Stagg Industries and use the Orb of Ra to return to their elemental forms. They rejoin the other heroes to fight Doctor Dread's Dreadfuls. Subsequently, Rex is made chief security officer at Stagg Industries, and his relationship with Sapphire is repaired.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMetamorpho can transmute his body to any of a wide variety of elemental compounds and form it to his will. Originally, he was limited to the elements which occur naturally in the human body. Over time, this limitation seems to have disappeared. He can alter the shapes and consistencies of these elements and combine them to form complex compounds. Rex can assume forms of gas, liquid or solid states.\n\nMetamorpho can also shape parts and portions of his body instead of the whole. He can form such complex shapes as a tank and a bicycle and such simple forms as a cloud or a spring.\n\nThe nature of Rex's body provides him with natural body armor, offering damage resistance from blunt attacks and energy attacks.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Justice===\nRex Mason/Metamorpho appears in the 12-issue mini-series ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'', as a member of the [[Justice League]].<ref>''Justice'' #7</ref>\n\n===JLA: The Nail===\nIn the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' story ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', an unstable Metamorpho is forced to kill the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]] by the [[Jimmy Olsen|unknown mastermind]] behind the recent anti-metahuman propaganda.

Before Metamorpho can act, Plastic Man teleports him, his son and all of the prison's inmates to a mirror dimension using some of [[Mirror Master]]'s technology. In Year Five, after [[Deathstroke]] breaks into [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] to get the [[Mother Box]] for [[Batman]] and [[Lex Luthor]], he is greeted by Metamorpho before he can leave.

The character has been moderately popular since his introduction in 1965. Originally adventurer Rex Mason, he is converted into a man made of a shifting mass of chemicals after being cursed by an ancient artifact that he has retrieved.\n\n==Publication history==\nMetamorpho's creator, [[Bob Haney]], had seen success with DC Comics in 1963 with the titles ''[[Metal Men]]'' and ''[[Doom Patrol]]'', featuring bands of superheroes exhibiting fantastic powers. Under the editorial management of [[George Kashdan]], Haney was asked to capitalize on these titles' popularity with a similar character. Metamorpho, the Element Man, debuted in ''[[The Brave and the Bold]]'' #57 (January 1965).<ref>{{cite book| last= McAvennie |first= Michael| editor-last= Dolan| editor-first= Hannah |chapter= 1960s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle| publisher= [[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 114 |quote = Scribe Bob Haney and artist Ramona Fradon were truly in their element...Haney and Fradon's collaborative chemistry resulted in [Rex] Mason becoming Metamorpho.}}</ref>\n\nAs first conceived, Metamorpho was a parody of the fantastic characters that populated comic books in the 1960s.<ref>{{cite book | last=Jones | first=Gerard |author2=Will Jacobs | title=The Comic Book Heroes | location=[[Rocklin, California]] | publisher=Prima Lifestyles | pages=76\u201377 | date=October 23, 1996 | isbn=978-0-7615-0393-4}}</ref> Artist [[Ramona Fradon]] was coaxed out of maternity retirement to illustrate Metamorpho's first appearances. The popularity of Metamorpho's appearances in ''The Brave and the Bold'' led to a 17-issue [[ongoing series]] between 1965 and 1968. Metamorpho also appeared during this time in two issues of ''Justice League of America'' (#42 and #44) and became the second superhero to decline an invitation to join that organization ([[Adam Strange]] being the first), though he did become a reservist, eventually being called in during a Justice League/Justice Society crossover to help find and rescue the Seven Soldiers of Victory.\n\nMetamorpho appears on the cover of ''Aquaman'' #30 as one of the pallbearers (along with Batman, Hawkman, and Superman) at the \"Sea King's Funeral\".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://comicvine.gamespot.com/aquaman-30-the-death-of-aquaman/4000-108970/ |title=Aquaman #30 - The Death of Aquaman |website=Comic Vine |access-date=15 April 2016}}</ref> Metamorpho also appears in a series of backup stories in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #413\u2013418 and ''[[World's Finest Comics]]'' #218\u2013220 and #229.<ref>{{cite journal|last = Stroud|first = Bryan|title = Metamorpho in ''Action Comics'' |journal= [[Back Issue!]] |issue = 64 |pages = 22\u201327| publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date = May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, Metamorpho appeared in ''[[1st Issue Special]]'' #3, a brief anthology series consisting of one-shots. That issue was written by Bob Haney and illustrated by Ramona Fradon, Metamorpho's creators. Haney and Fradon had met at the 1974 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], and while reminiscing, it emerged that both of them regarded Metamorpho as one of the features they'd most enjoyed working on, leading them to ask DC if they could do one more Metamorpho story together.<ref name=\"back71\">{{cite journal|last=Abramowitz |first= Jack| title= 1st Issue Special: It Was No ''Showcase'' (But It Was Never Meant To Be)| journal= [[Back Issue!]]| issue=71 |page= 42| publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]| date= April 2014 |location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> Fradon later commented, \"I think we both felt that Metamorpho was our baby.

This and other incidents begin to fuel in Stagg a dislike for Mason that ultimately leads to a plot to kill him.\n\nIn an [[Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian pyramid]], Rex Mason is knocked unconscious by Simon's brutish bodyguard [[Java (comics)|Java]] and is eventually exposed to a radioactive [[meteoroid|meteor]]ite from which the Orb of [[Ra]] was fashioned. A tremendous flare-up of its radiation transforms Mason into Metamorpho, the Element Man. He gains the ability to [[shapeshifting|shapeshift]] and change himself into any [[chemical element|element]] or combination of elements found in the human body. It is also established in his origin story in ''[[The Brave & The Bold]]'' #57 that Metamorpho is virtually invulnerable in his inert (untransformed) state, when Stagg, afraid that Rex is going to kill him, shoots him point-blank without effect. The Orb of Ra, however, has the same effect on Rex that [[kryptonite]] has on [[Superman]]. Thus Stagg continues to control Metamorpho using the Orb. Later, it is revealed that Mason is but one of many [[metamorphae]]. They were created by the sun god Ra, using the meteorite, to serve as warriors in his battle against the god [[Apep]], \"the serpent who never dies.\"<ref>{{cite book | title=The DC Comics Encyclopedia | last1=Beatty | first1=Scott | authorlink1=Scott Beatty | last2=Jimenez | first2=Phil | authorlink2=Phil Jimenez | date=October 4, 2004 | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] Limited | isbn=978-0-7566-0592-6 | page=202}}</ref>\n\nMetamorpho, unlike most super-humanoids described in DC Comics, cannot assume a normal, fully human appearance, being no longer composed of flesh, blood and bone. As such, he regards his metamorphic powers as a disease and seeks a cure for his condition. Because he considers himself a freak and wishes only to be restored to his former human state, he rejects an offer of membership from the [[Justice League of America]] in ''JLA'' #42. [[Green Lantern]] attempts to change him back using his power ring, but due to a \"yellow\" component of the meteorite radiation, is unable to make him normal again.\n\nMetamorpho briefly has a crimefighting partner named Urania \"Rainie\" Blackwell, a woman who deliberately exposed herself to the Orb to gain its powers. She calls herself [[Element Girl]] (nicknamed \"the Chemical Doll\") and works with him on a number of cases.\n\nIssues #16\u201317 were intended to show a new direction for the series, with Sapphire marrying a man named Wally Bannister and Metamorpho joining a mysterious Mr. Shadow to deal with an immortal queen. Bent on world conquest, the queen (an exact lookalike of Sapphire) marries Metamorpho. She later steps outside her mystic city and instantly ages 2,000 years. When Wally Bannister is murdered by Algon (a metamorph who has lived for centuries in a depowered state), Metamorpho is [[frame-up|framed]]. Instead of coming to his defense against the false accusations, Metamorpho's colleague Mr. Shadow comes forth as an enemy. It is revealed that Mr. Shadow was attempting to enslave Metamorpho all along. Metamorpho is tried and convicted by a jury of rabble and is then executed by [[absolute zero]]; the first of what will become a series of multiple if temporary deaths.\n\nElement Girl revives Metamorpho, and Algon, the real murderer, is killed by molten lava minerals in an attempt to regain his burned-out powers. It is later learned that Mr. Bannister's murder was actually engineered by the villainous Prosecutor, who is then killed by an [[insectoid]] villain in a cocoon. At this point, issue #17 ends, and the story is never continued.\n\nMetamorpho reappears years later in ''The Brave and the Bold'' #101 (April\u2013May 1972). It is revealed that Metamorpho had spent the period after the end of his own series immersed in a painful chemical bath concocted by Stagg in an attempt to cure his condition. Stagg retrieves him from this \"cure\" too early because he needs Mason to save his endangered daughter Sapphire. Metamorpho stars in a new backup series beginning in ''Action'' #413 (June 1972). There is no reference in this revival series to the events or characters of his previous two issues.\n\nUrania Blackwell, unreferenced since the end of the regular series, is later revealed to have ended her partnership with Metamopho when her unrequited attraction to him became too much for her. Blackwell's powers are removed at her own request by Ra, resulting in her death; the episode, in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (Vertigo)|Sandman]],'' involves [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]]. Death mentions Algon's death in passing, trying to convince Blackwell that she will not live forever.\n\n===Outsiders===\nMetamorpho spends some time working with the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]]. While in the [[despotism|despotically]] ruled nation Mozombia, Metamorpho is subdued and dissassembled. The tyrant's forces keep him inert with a constant application of radiation. He is freed by [[Katana (comics)|Katana's]] indestructible sword, which had been latched onto a live electrical wire. While leaving Mozombia, the Outsiders' plane is shot down by the [[Bad Samaritan]]. Metamorpho and the others spend some time stranded on a deserted island, simply too far away from land to rescue themselves.\n\nMetamorpho perishes for the second time during the ''[[Millennium (comics)|Millennium]]'' event.<ref name= outsiders27>{{Cite comic | writer=[[Mike W.

He is killed in the resulting battle.<ref name=outsiders27/> He is again revived during the ''[[Invasion! (DC Comics)|Invasion]]'' miniseries, when a gene-bomb set off by invading aliens affects his biomass.\n\n===Justice League===\nMetamorpho spends some time with the Justice League, including [[Justice League Europe]]. During this period he encounters Sapphire Stagg again. He becomes involved in a battle with the [[Metal Men]], who have been tricked by Simon Stagg. His League friends, [[Dimitri Pushkin|Rocket Red]] and [[Animal Man]], are at the site of the battle, but are being detained by Java. At the conclusion of the battle, Metamorpho learns he had a son with Sapphire. Unfortunately, the baby boy's touch harms all but Sapphire and Metamorpho. When Java holds the baby, his arms melt. Metamorpho hands the baby over to Simon, who immediately fears he will be affected like Java was moments before and die. However, something in his genetic structure protects him, just as it did with Sasphire. Simon's stance softens and everyone is set free. [[Will Magnus|Doc Magnus]], the leader of the Metal Men, offers his services in creating new arms for Java. On the way home, Metamorpho's friends are puzzled as to how he knew Simon would be unaffected by the child. Metamorpho indicates that he hoped the baby would kill Simon.\n\nLater, Metamorpho has a romantic relationship with [[Crimson Fox]], which is cut short by her apparent murder. His personal investigation of the incident uncovers multiple layers of lies and deceit. During his time with the team, while fighting the planet-smashing aliens called The Family, Metamorpho is hit by a powerful energy blast that destroys his body. He quickly re-forms in a totally different look. He will sport this new look until his next demise.\n\n===Third death and return===\nWhen the [[Hyperclan]] attacked the Justice League of America's [[Justice League Watchtower|orbiting base]], destroying it, Metamorpho protects three of his teammates, [[Albert Rothstein|Nuklon]], [[Obsidian (comics)|Obsidian]], and the original [[Icemaiden]], in a giant, fluid filled ball. The intent is for them to survive reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The three make it, injured but alive, but Metamorpho does not. He is buried with solemn honors. He is temporarily resurrected by the wish-granting [[The Cathexis|Id]] (fundamentally flawed because the wisher, his son Joey, only wished for him to be ''back'' rather than to be ''alive''). Later, he is definitively brought back to life by Sapphire Stagg using the Orb of Ra to bring Metamorpho back to life, and he briefly joined the [[Doom Patrol]].\n\nShortly thereafter, an accident with one of Simon Stagg's experiments turns Simon, Sapphire, and Joey into an energy being, and causes Metamorpho to take on the form and personality of Java. \"Java\" kidnaps [[Black Canary]], asking for her help in rescuing the others. With Canary's help, he becomes Metamorpho again and manages to return the others to their normal forms.<ref>''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #51\u201352 (March\u2013April 2003)</ref>\n\n===Outsiders / \"Shift\"===\nAt the same time, Metamorpho has seemingly been appearing in the ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) series, but Rex Mason informs the team that their \"Metamorpho\" is a regrown fragment of his own body.<ref>''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) #7 (February 2004)</ref> Rex attempts to reassimilate his \"twin\", but the Outsiders convince him that the twin deserves the chance to lead his own life. This second Metamorpho chose the name \"Shift\" and develops a relationship with [[Indigo (comics)|Indigo]]. When she dies, he becomes depressed over her death. After the events of ''[[One Year Later]]'', Shift willingly chooses to be reassimilated into Metamorpho, because he has killed several people. Rex steps in to fill Shift's position in the Outsiders. A full account of Shift's crimes is explained in the ''Outsiders'' (vol. 3) Annual; he had inadvertently killed 44 people during [[Black Lightning]]'s escape from [[Iron Heights Penitentiary]].\n\nMetamorpho continues to serve on the Outsiders when [[Batman]] takes over, and after its further restructuring following Batman's apparent death. He is apparently killed yet again alongside the rest of the team in a satellite explosion orchestrated by [[Talia al Ghul]].<ref>''[[Batman Incorporated]]: Leviathan Strikes''</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\nOn September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, an August 2013 story reveals that the Outsiders are revealed to have survived. It is stated that Metamorpho was able to save the team by the same technique he previously used to rescue the Justice League during the Hyperclan's attack.<ref>''Batman Incorporated'' (vol. 2) #1</ref> He is also shown as one of the candidates for the new [[Justice League International]], but is ultimately not chosen.<ref>''Justice League International'' (vol. 3) #1</ref>\n\n===DC Rebirth===\nIn the ''[[Watchmen]]'' sequel ''[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]'', Metamorpho is featured on the news as an apparent example of the \"Superman Theory,\" is which the government is thought to bave been experimenting on humans to give them superpowers.<ref>''Doomsday Clock'' #3 (January 2018).

While trying to get Simon Stagg to close the portal with the help of Plastic Man, Mister Terrific is sucked in to the portal with Plastic Man and Metamorpho. Plastic Man shields the others from the Dark Multiverse energy, which he is immune to. Upon arriving on a lifeless world they encounter Phantom Girl, who is been trapped in her intangible form and has no knowledge she has been sending a signal.

DC Comics. </ref> The Terrifics disband after learning that Java was Doctor Dread all along. Afterwards, Rex slowly comes to feel he is dull and worthless without his heroic role. On purpose, Rex and Element Dog sneak into Stagg Industries and use the Orb of Ra to return to their elemental forms. They rejoin the other heroes to fight Doctor Dread's Dreadfuls. Subsequently, Rex is made chief security officer at Stagg Industries, and his relationship with Sapphire is repaired.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMetamorpho can transmute his body to any of a wide variety of elemental compounds and form it to his will. Originally, he was limited to the elements which occur naturally in the human body. Over time, this limitation seems to have disappeared. He can alter the shapes and consistencies of these elements and combine them to form complex compounds. Rex can assume forms of gas, liquid or solid states.\n\nMetamorpho can also shape parts and portions of his body instead of the whole. He can form such complex shapes as a tank and a bicycle and such simple forms as a cloud or a spring.\n\nThe nature of Rex's body provides him with natural body armor, offering damage resistance from blunt attacks and energy attacks.\n\n==Other versions==\n===Justice===\nRex Mason/Metamorpho appears in the 12-issue mini-series ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'', as a member of the [[Justice League]].<ref>''Justice'' #7</ref>\n\n===JLA: The Nail===\nIn the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' story ''[[JLA: The Nail]]'', an unstable Metamorpho is forced to kill the [[Thinker (DC Comics)|Thinker]] by the [[Jimmy Olsen|unknown mastermind]] behind the recent anti-metahuman propaganda.

The project's head scientist, upon seeing [[Batman]] and [[Deadshot]] snooping around his lab, opens fire on the pair with a laser rifle, hitting the tank storing Metamorpho and freeing it. After a brief fight, which results in Metamorpho escaping into Stagg Enterprises' parking lot, Batman is engulfed.

The squadron finally received some British [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s, mostly armed with a single fuselage-mounted Vickers machine gun, and flew two missions in November 1918 days before the war ended.  The first patrol was uneventful and the other patrol targeted a truck convoy in [[Metz]] with 20 lb bombs hand-dropped from their S.E. 5a aircraft.

Although eventually found to have made an emergency forced landing in Ecuador, three B-18s of the squadron conducted extensive searches of the area along the 80th meridian some 250 miles to sea. The aircraft carried enough fuel for a flight of 11 hours duration.  On 20 November 1940, the unit became the '''25th Bombardment Squadron''' (Heavy)<ref name=25SRSfacts/> in anticipation of the receipt of [[Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]]es.  By 25 August 1941, with its pre-war strength at but five B-18s, the Squadron was finally re-equipped with B-17E Flying Fortresses.\n\n===World War II===\n====Antisubmarine campaign====\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the squadron left its long time home at France Field for [[Rio Hato Airport]], Panama.  Little more than a month later, it began operations from [[Salinas Airfield]], Ecuador and the [[Galapagos Islands]] (shuttling patrols back and forth) with four of the B-17Es, flying antisubmarine patrols over the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal.  These aircraft being joined by a B-18 by February.  The main body of the Squadron left Salinas by 15 February and returned to [[Howard Field]] in early 1943, although a detachment was still in Ecuador as late as 30 June.\n\nOn 12 May 1943, the squadron was transferred to the [[40th Bombardment Group]] and, the following month, the main body of the squadron, which had been at Howard Field only briefly in the spring of 1943, ended its 21 years of service in the Canal Zone, and moved to the United States.\n\n====Strategic attacks on Japan====\n[[File:25th Bombardment Squadron - B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-29 Superfortress at Chakulia Airfield, India<ref group=note>Aircraft is Boeing B-29-10-BW Superfortress, serial 42-6331.

It received prototype and early production-model [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombers.  It trained under [[Second Air Force]] for an extended period due to [[Boeing]] technicians making modifications to its B-29 aircraft.  It deployed with the new [[XX Bomber Command]] as part of the [[58th Bombardment Wing]] to the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], flying to bases in India via South Atlantic ferrying route; across central Africa and Arabia to [[Karachi]].  Additional modifications to its B-29s were necessary in India to accommodate very high ground temperatures (115&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nFrom airfields in eastern India, engaged in very long range bombardment raids on Japan.  The squadron participated in the first American Air Force attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the 1942 [[Doolittle raid]] on 15/16 June 1944, attacking the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at [[Yawata]] on [[Kyushu]] by using its forward staging base at [[Hsinching Airfield]] (A-1), China, for refueling.<ref name=\"B-29\">Mann, {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> It performed a total of nine missions to Japan, also engaged in very long range attacks against enemy targets in Thailand, Manchuria, Borneo, Formosa, Burma, Malaya, Japanese-occupied China, [[Singapore]], [[Saigon]] and [[Cam Rahn Bay]], French Indochina.  It also engaged in aerial mining of Japanese-occupied seaports in Thailand, Malaya and French Indochina.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nThe advance of American forces in the Central Pacific though the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] made new airfields available within the effective bombing range of Japan.  It moved to [[West Field (Tinian)]] in April 1945, becoming part of the new [[XXI Bomber Command]].  From the Marianas, it engaged in very long range strategic attacks on Japan, its first mission being on 5 May 1945 against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory in [[Kure]].  Air attacks over Japan were initially high-altitude daylight bombing missions against industrial, transportation and military targets, largely ineffective due to high upper level winds dispersing bombs over a wide area.  By July, began low-level large area night incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. Continued aerial assaults until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945, final combat mission taking place on 9/10 August attacking the [[Hikari, Yamaguchi|Hikari]] Naval Arsenal.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nAfter [[V-J Day]], the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show-of-force missions.  The squadron returned to the United States in November 1945 and was inactivated at [[Davis-Monthan Field]], Arizona in the fall of 1946.<ref name=25SRSfacts/>\n\n===Strategic bombardment===\n[[File: 25th BS Smoky Hill AFB Kansas flight line.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-47s on Smoky Hill AFB flight line in 1956]]\nThe squadron was reactivated at [[Smoky Hill Air Force Base]], Kansasin 1952 as [[Strategic Air Command]] expanded its bomber force.  The 25th initially received what were by then second-line B-29s for training and organization.  The propeller-driven B-29s were replaced with new [[Boeing B-47E Stratojet]] swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. The 25th began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in early 1964 and was one of the last SAC squadrons equipped with the Stratojet.  The squadron inactivated in September 1964 when the last B-47 aircraft was retired from SAC.\n\n===Strategic weapons training===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:25th STS Strategic Weapons Center.jpeg|thumb|25 STS's $5.4M Strategic Weapons Center at Ellsworth AFB in 1989]] -->\nThe 25th was reactivated in 1988 as a SAC training squadron.

The squadron finally received some British [[Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5]]s, mostly armed with a single fuselage-mounted Vickers machine gun, and flew two missions in November 1918 days before the war ended.  The first patrol was uneventful and the other patrol targeted a truck convoy in [[Metz]] with 20 lb bombs hand-dropped from their S.E. 5a aircraft.

Although eventually found to have made an emergency forced landing in Ecuador, three B-18s of the squadron conducted extensive searches of the area along the 80th meridian some 250 miles to sea. The aircraft carried enough fuel for a flight of 11 hours duration.  On 20 November 1940, the unit became the '''25th Bombardment Squadron''' (Heavy)<ref name=25SRSfacts/> in anticipation of the receipt of [[Boeing B-17E Flying Fortress]]es.  By 25 August 1941, with its pre-war strength at but five B-18s, the Squadron was finally re-equipped with B-17E Flying Fortresses.\n\n===World War II===\n====Antisubmarine campaign====\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the squadron left its long time home at France Field for [[Rio Hato Airport]], Panama.  Little more than a month later, it began operations from [[Salinas Airfield]], Ecuador and the [[Galapagos Islands]] (shuttling patrols back and forth) with four of the B-17Es, flying antisubmarine patrols over the Pacific approaches to the Panama Canal.  These aircraft being joined by a B-18 by February.  The main body of the Squadron left Salinas by 15 February and returned to [[Howard Field]] in early 1943, although a detachment was still in Ecuador as late as 30 June.\n\nOn 12 May 1943, the squadron was transferred to the [[40th Bombardment Group]] and, the following month, the main body of the squadron, which had been at Howard Field only briefly in the spring of 1943, ended its 21 years of service in the Canal Zone, and moved to the United States.\n\n====Strategic attacks on Japan====\n[[File:25th Bombardment Squadron - B-29 Superfortress.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-29 Superfortress at Chakulia Airfield, India<ref group=note>Aircraft is Boeing B-29-10-BW Superfortress, serial 42-6331.

It received prototype and early production-model [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] very heavy bombers.  It trained under [[Second Air Force]] for an extended period due to [[Boeing]] technicians making modifications to its B-29 aircraft.  It deployed with the new [[XX Bomber Command]] as part of the [[58th Bombardment Wing]] to the [[China-Burma-India Theater]], flying to bases in India via South Atlantic ferrying route; across central Africa and Arabia to [[Karachi]].  Additional modifications to its B-29s were necessary in India to accommodate very high ground temperatures (115&nbsp;\u00b0F).\n\nFrom airfields in eastern India, engaged in very long range bombardment raids on Japan.  The squadron participated in the first American Air Force attack on the Japanese Home Islands since the 1942 [[Doolittle raid]] on 15/16 June 1944, attacking the Imperial Iron and Steel Works at [[Yawata]] on [[Kyushu]] by using its forward staging base at [[Hsinching Airfield]] (A-1), China, for refueling.<ref name=\"B-29\">Mann, {{page needed|date=April 2018}}</ref> It performed a total of nine missions to Japan, also engaged in very long range attacks against enemy targets in Thailand, Manchuria, Borneo, Formosa, Burma, Malaya, Japanese-occupied China, [[Singapore]], [[Saigon]] and [[Cam Rahn Bay]], French Indochina.  It also engaged in aerial mining of Japanese-occupied seaports in Thailand, Malaya and French Indochina.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nThe advance of American forces in the Central Pacific though the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] made new airfields available within the effective bombing range of Japan.  It moved to [[West Field (Tinian)]] in April 1945, becoming part of the new [[XXI Bomber Command]].  From the Marianas, it engaged in very long range strategic attacks on Japan, its first mission being on 5 May 1945 against the Hiro Naval Aircraft Factory in [[Kure]].  Air attacks over Japan were initially high-altitude daylight bombing missions against industrial, transportation and military targets, largely ineffective due to high upper level winds dispersing bombs over a wide area.  By July, began low-level large area night incendiary raids on urban areas, and dropped mines in Japanese shipping lanes. Continued aerial assaults until the Japanese Capitulation in August 1945, final combat mission taking place on 9/10 August attacking the [[Hikari, Yamaguchi|Hikari]] Naval Arsenal.<ref name=\"B-29\"/>\n\nAfter [[V-J Day]], the squadron dropped food and supplies to Allied prisoners in Japan, Korea, and Formosa, and took part in show-of-force missions.  The squadron returned to the United States in November 1945 and was inactivated at [[Davis-Monthan Field]], Arizona in the fall of 1946.<ref name=25SRSfacts/>\n\n===Strategic bombardment===\n[[File: 25th BS Smoky Hill AFB Kansas flight line.jpg|thumb|Squadron B-47s on Smoky Hill AFB flight line in 1956]]\nThe squadron was reactivated at [[Smoky Hill Air Force Base]], Kansasin 1952 as [[Strategic Air Command]] expanded its bomber force.  The 25th initially received what were by then second-line B-29s for training and organization.  The propeller-driven B-29s were replaced with new [[Boeing B-47E Stratojet]] swept-wing medium bombers in 1954, capable of flying at high subsonic speeds and primarily designed for penetrating the airspace of the Soviet Union. In the 1960s, the B-47 was considered to be reaching obsolescence and was being phased out of SAC's strategic arsenal. The 25th began sending aircraft to other B-47 wings as replacements in early 1964 and was one of the last SAC squadrons equipped with the Stratojet.  The squadron inactivated in September 1964 when the last B-47 aircraft was retired from SAC.\n\n===Strategic weapons training===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:25th STS Strategic Weapons Center.jpeg|thumb|25 STS's $5.4M Strategic Weapons Center at Ellsworth AFB in 1989]] -->\nThe 25th was reactivated in 1988 as a SAC training squadron.
