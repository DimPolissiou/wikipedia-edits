In 1989, after several years of critical acclaim but little commercial success, she had a major hit with the album ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]''. The following two albums, ''[[Luck of the Draw (album)|Luck of the Draw]]'' (1991) and ''[[Longing in Their Hearts]]'' (1994), were multimillion sellers, generating several hit singles, including \"[[Something to Talk About (Bonnie Raitt song)|Something to Talk About]]\", \"[[Love Sneakin' Up On You|Love Sneakin' Up on You]]\", and the ballad \"[[I Can't Make You Love Me]]\" (with [[Bruce Hornsby]] on piano).\n\nRaitt has received 10 [[Grammy Awards]].

Raitt said it was an \"opportunity that changed everything.\"<ref name=\"oprah\" />\n\n==Career==\n\n===1970\u20131976===\nIn the summer of 1970, she played with her brother David on stand up bass with  [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]] at the Philly Folk Festival as well as Opening for John Hammond at [[the Gaslight Cafe]] in New York, she was seen by a reporter from ''Newsweek'', who began to spread the word about her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer from [[Warner Bros.]], who soon released her debut album, ''[[Bonnie Raitt (album)|Bonnie Raitt]]'', in 1971. The album was warmly received by the music press, with many writers praising her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.\n\nWhile admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, ''[[Give It Up (Bonnie Raitt album)|Give It Up]]'', was released in 1972 to positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Bonnie Raiit: Give It Up |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/give-it-up-mw0000196849 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> Though many critics{{who|date=March 2015}} still regard it as her best work, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973's ''[[Takin' My Time]]'' was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.\n\nRaitt began to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for ''Rolling Stone'', but with 1974's ''[[Streetlights (Bonnie Raitt album)|Streetlights]]'', reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed. By this point, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975's ''[[Home Plate (album)|Home Plate]]''. In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on [[Warren Zevon]]'s [[Warren Zevon (album)|eponymous album]].\n\n===1977\u20131988===\n[[File:Bonnie Raitt2.jpg|thumb|230px|Raitt performing at the [[Berkeley Community Theater]], 1976\u20131977]]\n1977's ''[[Sweet Forgiveness]]'' album gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough when it yielded a hit single in her remake of [[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|\"Runaway.\"]] Recast as a heavy [[rhythm and blues]] recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by [[Al Green]], Raitt's version of \"Runaway\" was disparaged by many critics. However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Records]]. \"There was this big Columbia\u2013Warner war going on at the time\", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"[[James Taylor]] had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia...And then, Warner signed [[Paul Simon]] away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia \u2013 no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nWarner Brothers held higher expectations for Raitt's next album, ''[[The Glow]]'', in 1979, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales. Raitt had one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The shows spawned the three-record gold album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', as well as a Warner Brothers feature film [[No Nukes (film)|of the same name]]. The shows featured co-founders [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], and Raitt as well as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Carly Simon]], [[James Taylor]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], and others.\n\nIn 1980, she appeared as herself in the Paramount film \"Urban Cowboy\" where she sang \"Don't It Make You Wanna Dance.\"\n\nFor her next record, 1982's ''[[Green Light (Bonnie Raitt album)|Green Light]]'', Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records. However, to her surprise, many of her peers and the media compared her new sound to the burgeoning [[New wave music|new wave]] movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this had a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Brothers.\n\n====''Tongue and Groove'' and release from Warner Brothers====\nIn 1983, as Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, entitled ''Tongue and Groove'', Warner Brothers \"cleaned house\", dropping a number of major artists such as [[Van Morrison]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]] from their roster. The day after mastering was completed on ''Tongue & Groove'', the record label dropped Raitt also. The album was shelved indefinitely, and Raitt was left without a record label. By then, Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse problems.<ref name=\"notbroken\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3445_162-1209936.html |title=Bonnie Raitt Will Not Be Broken |publisher=[[CBS News]] |last=Benjamin |first=Scott |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=2012-04-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422171711/http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3445_162-1209936.html |archivedate=April 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of \"[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]\", the anti-[[apartheid]] record written and produced by guitarist [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Along with her participation in [[Farm Aid]] and [[Amnesty International]] concerts, Raitt traveled to Moscow in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in Los Angeles for Countdown '87 to Stop [[Contras|Contra]] Aid. The benefit featured herself along with musicians [[Don Henley]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Holly Near]] and others.\n\nTwo years after dropping her from their label, Warner Brothers notified Raitt of their plans to release ''Tongue and Groove''. \"I said it wasn't really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as ''[[Nine Lives (Bonnie Raitt album)|Nine Lives]]''.\" A critical and commercial disappointment, ''Nine Lives'', released in 1986, was Raitt's last new recording for Warner Brothers.\n\nIn late 1987, Raitt joined singers [[k.d. lang]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] as female background vocalists for [[Roy Orbison]]'s television special, ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]''. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, Raitt began working on new material. By then, she was clean and sober, having resolved her problems with substance abuse. She later credited [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] for his help in a [[Minnesota State Fair]] concert<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/457/v-print/story/38243.html |title=Grand stands: A longtime fairgoer's most unforgettable shows |author=Jon Bream |date=August 22, 2002 |publisher=StarTribune.com |accessdate=2011-04-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828220833/http://www.startribune.com/457/v-print/story/38243.html |archivedate=August 28, 2007 }}</ref> the night after Vaughan's 1990 death. During this time, Raitt considered signing with the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]-owned [[Paisley Park]] label, but negotiations ultimately fell through. Instead she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock under the production guidance of [[Don Was]] at [[Capitol Records]].\n\nRaitt had met Was through [[Hal Wilner]], who was putting together ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films|Stay Awake]]'', a tribute album to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] music for [[A&M Records|A&M]]. Was and Wilner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for \"[[Baby Mine (song)|Baby Mine]]\", the lullaby from ''[[Dumbo]]''. Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Was to produce her next album.\n\n===1989\u20131999: Commercial breakthrough===\n[[Image:Bonnie Raitt.jpg|thumb|200px|Raitt at the 1990 [[Grammy Awards]]]]\nAfter working with Was on the ''Stay Awake'' album, Raitt's management, Gold Mountain, approached numerous labels about a new record deal, and she was signed to Capitol by A&R executive [[Tim Devine]]. At Capitol, after nearly 20 years, Raitt achieved belated commercial success with her tenth album, ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]''. Released in the spring of 1989, ''Nick of Time'' went to the top of the U.S. charts following Raitt's Grammy sweep in early 1990. This album has been voted number 230 in the ''Rolling Stone'' list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]'' was also the first of many of her recordings to feature her longtime rhythm section of [[Ricky Fataar]] and [[James \"Hutch\" Hutchinson]] (although previously Fataar had played on her ''Green Light'' album and Hutchinson had worked on ''Nine Lives''), both of whom record and tour with her to this day. ''Nick of Time'' has sold over six million copies in the US alone.\n\nRaitt followed up this success with three more Grammy Awards for her 1991 album ''[[Luck of the Draw (album)|Luck of the Draw]]'' which sold nearly 8 million copies in the United States. Three years later, in 1994, she added two more Grammys with her album ''[[Longing in Their Hearts]]'', her second no. 1 album. Both of these albums were multi-platinum successes. Raitt's collaboration with Was amicably came to an end with 1995's live release ''[[Road Tested]]''. Released to solid reviews, it sold well enough to be certified gold.\n\n\"Rock Steady\" was a hit written by Bryan Adams and Gretchen Peters in 1995. The song was written as a duet with Bryan Adams and Bonnie Raitt for her Road Tested tour, which also became one of her albums. The original demo version of the song appears on Adams' 1996 single \"Let's Make a Night to Remember\".\n\nFor her next studio album, Raitt hired [[Mitchell Froom]] and [[Tchad Blake]] as her producers. \"I loved working with [[Don Was]] but I wanted to give myself and my fans a stretch and do something different,\" Raitt said. Her work with Froom and Blake was released on ''[[Fundamental (Bonnie Raitt album)|Fundamental]]'' in 1998.\n\n===2000\u20132007===\n[[File:BonnieRaitt2004.jpg|thumb|200px|Raitt performing at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], April 23, 2004]]\nIn March 2000, Raitt was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in Cleveland, Ohio. ''[[Silver Lining (album)|Silver Lining]]'' was released in 2002. In the US, it reached number 13 on the Billboard chart and was later certified Gold. It contains the singles \"I Can't Help You Now\", \"Time of Our Lives\", and the title track. All three singles charted within the top 40 of the US Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nOn March 19, 2002, Bonnie Raitt received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for her contributions to the recording industry, located at 1750 N.

Raitt said it was an \"opportunity that changed everything.\"<ref name=\"oprah\" />\n\n==Career==\n\n===1970\u20131976===\nIn the summer of 1970, she played with her brother David on stand up bass with  [[Mississippi Fred McDowell]] at the Philly Folk Festival as well as Opening for John Hammond at [[the Gaslight Cafe]] in New York, she was seen by a reporter from ''Newsweek'', who began to spread the word about her performance. Scouts from major record companies were soon attending her shows to watch her play. She eventually accepted an offer from [[Warner Bros.]], who soon released her debut album, ''[[Bonnie Raitt (album)|Bonnie Raitt]]'', in 1971. The album was warmly received by the music press, with many writers praising her skills as an interpreter and as a bottleneck guitarist; at the time, few women in popular music had strong reputations as guitarists.\n\nWhile admired by those who saw her perform, and respected by her peers, Raitt gained little public acclaim for her work. Her critical stature continued to grow but record sales remained modest. Her second album, ''[[Give It Up (Bonnie Raitt album)|Give It Up]]'', was released in 1972 to positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Stephen Thomas |title=Bonnie Raiit: Give It Up |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/give-it-up-mw0000196849 |website=AllMusic |accessdate=24 January 2019}}</ref> Though many critics{{who|date=March 2015}} still regard it as her best work, it did not change her commercial fortunes. 1973's ''[[Takin' My Time]]'' was also met with critical acclaim, but these notices were not matched by the sales.\n\nRaitt began to receive greater press coverage, including a 1975 cover story for ''Rolling Stone'', but with 1974's ''[[Streetlights (Bonnie Raitt album)|Streetlights]]'', reviews for her work were becoming increasingly mixed. By this point, Raitt was already experimenting with different producers and different styles, and she began to adopt a more mainstream sound that continued through 1975's ''[[Home Plate (album)|Home Plate]]''. In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on [[Warren Zevon]]'s [[Warren Zevon (album)|eponymous album]].\n\n===1977\u20131988===\n[[File:Bonnie Raitt2.jpg|thumb|230px|Raitt performing at the [[Berkeley Community Theater]], 1976\u20131977]]\n1977's ''[[Sweet Forgiveness]]'' album gave Raitt her first commercial breakthrough when it yielded a hit single in her remake of [[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|\"Runaway.\"]] Recast as a heavy [[rhythm and blues]] recording based on a rhythmic groove inspired by [[Al Green]], Raitt's version of \"Runaway\" was disparaged by many critics. However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Records]]. \"There was this big Columbia\u2013Warner war going on at the time\", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"[[James Taylor]] had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia...And then, Warner signed [[Paul Simon]] away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia \u2013 no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal.\"{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nWarner Brothers held higher expectations for Raitt's next album, ''[[The Glow]]'', in 1979, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales. Raitt had one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The shows spawned the three-record gold album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', as well as a Warner Brothers feature film [[No Nukes (film)|of the same name]]. The shows featured co-founders [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], and Raitt as well as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Carly Simon]], [[James Taylor]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], and others.\n\nIn 1980, she appeared as herself in the Paramount film \"Urban Cowboy\" where she sang \"Don't It Make You Wanna Dance.\"\n\nFor her next record, 1982's ''[[Green Light (Bonnie Raitt album)|Green Light]]'', Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records. However, to her surprise, many of her peers and the media compared her new sound to the burgeoning [[New wave music|new wave]] movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this had a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Brothers.\n\n====''Tongue and Groove'' and release from Warner Brothers====\nIn 1983, as Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, entitled ''Tongue and Groove'', Warner Brothers \"cleaned house\", dropping a number of major artists such as [[Van Morrison]] and [[Arlo Guthrie]] from their roster. The day after mastering was completed on ''Tongue & Groove'', the record label dropped Raitt also. The album was shelved indefinitely, and Raitt was left without a record label. By then, Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse problems.<ref name=\"notbroken\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3445_162-1209936.html |title=Bonnie Raitt Will Not Be Broken |publisher=[[CBS News]] |last=Benjamin |first=Scott |date=February 18, 2009 |accessdate=2012-04-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422171711/http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3445_162-1209936.html |archivedate=April 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of \"[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]\", the anti-[[apartheid]] record written and produced by guitarist [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Along with her participation in [[Farm Aid]] and [[Amnesty International]] concerts, Raitt traveled to Moscow in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in Los Angeles for Countdown '87 to Stop [[Contras|Contra]] Aid. The benefit featured herself along with musicians [[Don Henley]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Holly Near]] and others.\n\nTwo years after dropping her from their label, Warner Brothers notified Raitt of their plans to release ''Tongue and Groove''. \"I said it wasn't really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as ''[[Nine Lives (Bonnie Raitt album)|Nine Lives]]''.\" A critical and commercial disappointment, ''Nine Lives'', released in 1986, was Raitt's last new recording for Warner Brothers.\n\nIn late 1987, Raitt joined singers [[k.d. lang]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] as female background vocalists for [[Roy Orbison]]'s television special, ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]''. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, Raitt began working on new material. By then, she was clean and sober, having resolved her problems with substance abuse. She later credited [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] for his help in a [[Minnesota State Fair]] concert<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/457/v-print/story/38243.html |title=Grand stands: A longtime fairgoer's most unforgettable shows |author=Jon Bream |date=August 22, 2002 |publisher=StarTribune.com |accessdate=2011-04-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828220833/http://www.startribune.com/457/v-print/story/38243.html |archivedate=August 28, 2007 }}</ref> the night after Vaughan's 1990 death. During this time, Raitt considered signing with the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]-owned [[Paisley Park]] label, but negotiations ultimately fell through. Instead she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock under the production guidance of [[Don Was]] at [[Capitol Records]].\n\nRaitt had met Was through [[Hal Wilner]], who was putting together ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films|Stay Awake]]'', a tribute album to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] music for [[A&M Records|A&M]]. Was and Wilner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for \"[[Baby Mine (song)|Baby Mine]]\", the lullaby from ''[[Dumbo]]''. Raitt was very pleased with the sessions, and she asked Was to produce her next album.\n\n===1989\u20131999: Commercial breakthrough===\n[[Image:Bonnie Raitt.jpg|thumb|200px|Raitt at the 1990 [[Grammy Awards]]]]\nAfter working with Was on the ''Stay Awake'' album, Raitt's management, Gold Mountain, approached numerous labels about a new record deal, and she was signed to Capitol by A&R executive [[Tim Devine]]. At Capitol, after nearly 20 years, Raitt achieved belated commercial success with her tenth album, ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]''. Released in the spring of 1989, ''Nick of Time'' went to the top of the U.S. charts following Raitt's Grammy sweep in early 1990. This album has been voted number 230 in the ''Rolling Stone'' list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]'' was also the first of many of her recordings to feature her longtime rhythm section of [[Ricky Fataar]] and [[James \"Hutch\" Hutchinson]] (although previously Fataar had played on her ''Green Light'' album and Hutchinson had worked on ''Nine Lives''), both of whom record and tour with her to this day. ''Nick of Time'' has sold over six million copies in the US alone.\n\nRaitt followed up this success with three more Grammy Awards for her 1991 album ''[[Luck of the Draw (album)|Luck of the Draw]]'' which sold nearly 8 million copies in the United States. Three years later, in 1994, she added two more Grammys with her album ''[[Longing in Their Hearts]]'', her second no. 1 album. Both of these albums were multi-platinum successes. Raitt's collaboration with Was amicably came to an end with 1995's live release ''[[Road Tested]]''. Released to solid reviews, it sold well enough to be certified gold.\n\n\"Rock Steady\" was a hit written by Bryan Adams and Gretchen Peters in 1995. The song was written as a duet with Bryan Adams and Bonnie Raitt for her Road Tested tour, which also became one of her albums. The original demo version of the song appears on Adams' 1996 single \"Let's Make a Night to Remember\".\n\nFor her next studio album, Raitt hired [[Mitchell Froom]] and [[Tchad Blake]] as her producers. \"I loved working with [[Don Was]] but I wanted to give myself and my fans a stretch and do something different,\" Raitt said. Her work with Froom and Blake was released on ''[[Fundamental (Bonnie Raitt album)|Fundamental]]'' in 1998.\n\n===2000\u20132007===\n[[File:BonnieRaitt2004.jpg|thumb|200px|Raitt performing at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]], April 23, 2004]]\nIn March 2000, Raitt was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in Cleveland, Ohio.

I'm intolerable when it comes to perfection.  Sometimes I'm even downright mean about it.\"<ref name=OSU>{{cite news|title=Even U-M Bandsmen Aiming At Ohio State|publisher=The News-Palladium (Benton Harbor)|date=1970-10-21}}</ref>  Revelli added that his pursuit of perfection was about more than the music: \"This striving for perfection will carry over into other areas of their lives.\"<ref name=Better/>  In December 1964, Revelli described the guiding principles that he sought to instill into his students for 36 years.  In a speech delivered to the Marching Band prior to its appearance at the 1964 [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] game (and published in its entirety in the October 1994 issue of Michigan\u2019s alumni magazine ''Michigan Today''), Revelli said:\n\n\"Demand of yourself! How much do you demand of yourself of what I'm talking about? Not even 10 percent, some of you. ... I want to know how you can dedicate yourself to your forthcoming positions in the musical world, when you can't dedicate yourself right now to what you're doing in a simple little march. ... The world is full of people who do things just about right. Just about. And a few on the top do them just right\u2014most of the time. Nobody's perfect! When are you going to start to demand of yourself what I demand of myself? When are you going to be as uncompromising with what you do as I am uncompromising in what I hear and what I insist on? When? Are you waiting for some miracle? The miracle will be when you demand of yourself everything you've got of yourself. That'll be the day. And I don't only mean 5 minutes of 10; I mean 10 minutes out of 10; I mean 60 minutes out of an hour, 24 hours a day, at least all of your waking hours. ... I don't want it just about right! To me, just about right is terrible! ... Now, nobody's killed when you play a half-note as a dotted quarter. But you might, from learning to play a half-note a full half-note, make the difference in the lives of 50,000 little kids. ... You don't piddle with music\u2014it's a good-time-Charlie business, and for me, the wonderful good times come out of hearing somebody play beautifully. I don't care if it's \u2018[[Stars and Stripes Forever|Stars and Stripes]],\u2019 \u2018[[The Victors]]\u2019 or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him. When they play sloppy and don't care or don't know\u2014a great many of them don't even know, they don't know how bad it is\u2014they can be forgiven, but more they should be pitied.\u201d<ref name=Zucker/>\n\nRevelli also viewed school bands as a bulwark against juvenile delinquency.  He noted: \"We keep our musicians too interested and busy to get into mischief.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=High School Girls Participate In All-Star Ensemble|publisher=News-Palladium (Benton Harbor)|date=1955-07-25}}</ref>  On another occasion, he noted, \"Young music students have better things to do than get in trouble.\"<ref name=Better>{{cite news|title=Young WSC Musicians Perform Well|newspaper=Ogden Standard-Examiner|date=1966-08-13}}</ref>\n\n===Development of the Michigan Bands===\n[[File:Revelli3.jpg|thumb|220px|right|William Revelli, 1956]]\nRevelli recruited talented musicians to Michigan like a football coach recruited top athletes.   Revelli required all male wind instrument majors to participate in the Marching Band.  This requirement swelled the number of students in the Marching Band.<ref name=MMB>{{cite web|title=The Michigan Marching Band: The William Revelli Years 1935-1971|url=http://mmb.music.umich.edu/history/revelli.asp|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118160208/http://mmb.music.umich.edu/history/revelli.asp|archivedate=2008-01-18}}</ref> Revelli was also known for his use of new music in his performances, often commissioning new pieces.<ref name=Man/> Another innovation during Revelli\u2019s years as band director was the introduction of dance steps.  The tradition began with a dance routine to the tune [[Alexander's Ragtime Band]] which proved to be a big hit with the crowd.<ref name=MMB/>\n\nIn the 1930s, [[General Motors]] divisions, [[Buick]] and [[Chevrolet]], paid for the band to travel to away games.  In a show of appreciation, Revelli had the band line up in a \u201cBuck \u2013 I\u201d formation at the 1938 Ohio State game.  Then, while playing Buick\u2019s theme song, the letter \"I\" moved between the \"u\" and the \"c\" in \"Buck\" spelling out \"Buick\".  The next morning, athletic director [[Fielding H. Yost]] reportedly called Revelli at his home at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. and said: \"Young man,  never do that again!\u201d  Yost did not approve of the injection of commercial advertising onto the college football field.<ref name=MMB/>\n\nRevelli was also dedicated to furthering musical education in high schools.  He regularly toured the Midwest offering band clinics in small towns and big cities.  In 1949, Revelli held the first Band Day at [[Michigan Stadium]]. Twenty-nine high school bands marched into the stadium and played with the Michigan Marching Band under the direction of Revelli. By the 1960s, the number of Band Day participants had grown to more than 14,000.<ref name=Man/><ref name=MMB/> \nRevelli was also the Chairman of the Instrumental Winds Department at the University of Michigan.<ref name=Man/>  He was an advocate within the School of Music for wind music.  Aside from directing the large ensembles, Revelli promoted chamber music as well as the importance of private instruction on each student\u2019s wind instrument at the University.  Starting in 1942, Revelli offered the \u201cSmall Wood-wind ensemble,\u201d as a way to encourage wind chamber music.  The vision of professor Revelli helped bring in teachers for every wind instrument and paved the way for the University of Michigan to become one of the premiere music institutions in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=School of Music Wind Instruments|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nzeisler/History/|access-date=2008-01-29|archive-url=https://archive.is/20071021073420/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nzeisler/History/|archive-date=2007-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, the band moved to Harris Hall. Revelli joked that the band was making \"progress\" as it moved from a building built in 1854\u2014Morris Hall\u2014to one built in 1888.   The large upstairs room with its plaster walls and wooden floor provided the perfect acoustical setting for a band rehearsal. Revelli later said the \"Michigan Band sound\" was in part due to the perfect acoustics of Harris Hall and [[Hill Auditorium]].\n\nIn 1961, Revelli and the U-M Symphony Band, under sponsorship of the [[U.S. State Department]], toured the [[Soviet Union]], [[Romania]], [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], and five other Near East countries for 15 weeks.<ref name=State>{{cite news|title=5 Area Schools Participating In Music Clinic, Concert Here|newspaper=The Lima News|date=1962-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=University of Michigan Band Tours Bucharest|newspaper=Holland Evening Sentinel|date=1961-05-17}}</ref>  One of the attendees at the USSR concert in Minsk, USSR - according to the Warren Commission report - was none other than Lee Harvey Oswald - the reported assassin of John F.

Schembechler said, \u201cHe didn't just teach them \u2018The Victors.\u2019 He taught them Michigan tradition!\u201d<ref name=Bacon/>  Schembechler gathered the freshmen at [[Yost Ice Arena|Yost Field House]], and Revelli entered in full uniform \u2013 described by Schembechler as \u201ca lean, short, distinguished-looking older gentleman\u2014a band director right out of [[central casting]].\u201d<ref name=Bacon/>  Revelli rose to the podium, tapped his [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], looked right into their eyes and said, \"[[John Philip Sousa]] called this the greatest fight song ever written.  And you will sing it with respect!\"<ref name=Bacon/>  Revelli brought out a [[pitch pipe]] and began the instructions.  \u201cYou sing from down in here, in your [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].  You bring it up from down here with feeling.\u201d  Then he blew the starting note on his pitch pipe.  The players started, \"Hail to the Victors, valiant \u2013\"  Revelli interrupted, \u201cNo, No, No!  That\u2019s terrible!  There\u2019s no enthusiasm  You didn\u2019t sing with enthusiasm!\u201d<ref name=Brandstatter/>  They started again, and Revelli interrupted again.  \u201cNo, no, no!  We\u2019re gonna get this right if I\u2019m here all night!\u201d<ref name=Brandstatter/>\n\nSchembechler thought so much of Revelli\u2019s performance that he invited him back every year to teach the freshmen what Michigan tradition was about.<ref name=Bacon/>  Schembechler recalled, \u201cHe was absolutely great, and the freshmen absolutely loved it.  And let me tell you, every one of those freshmen came out of that session with Revelli knowing \u2018The Victors.\u2019  They knew the words, they knew how to sing it, and they knew how to emphasize the right spots.  They flat out knew how to do it.  And it was only because he came over there with the idea that those guys were going to come out of that meeting room knowing how to sing this fight song the right way or else!  And they did.  That was Bill Revelli.\u201d<ref name=Brandstatter/>\n\nThe admiration between Revelli and Schembechler was mutual.  In a 1970 interview, Revelli compared himself and his training methods to those of Schembechler.  \"Bo and I speak the same language.  Psychologically, our practices are the same.  Both the team and the band have to perfect their fundamentals before they can do anything else.  And both need proper warmups to stay in shape in the off-season.  Sometimes we'll spend 45 minutes on [[calisthenics]] of the [[embouchure]] (perfecting the position of the lips on the mouthpiece of an instrument).  I had one boy come back who hadn't practiced all summer.  His lips were about six months behind everyone else's.\"<ref name=OSU/>\n\n==College Band Directors National Association==\nRevelli was the founder of the College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) in 1941. The CBDNA  began as a committee of the Music Educators National Conference (MENC). In the fall of 1938 that committee, under the leadership of Revelli, met independently in Chicago. The group met again in December 1941 and formed the University and College Band Conductors Conference.

I'm intolerable when it comes to perfection.  Sometimes I'm even downright mean about it.\"<ref name=OSU>{{cite news|title=Even U-M Bandsmen Aiming At Ohio State|publisher=The News-Palladium (Benton Harbor)|date=1970-10-21}}</ref>  Revelli added that his pursuit of perfection was about more than the music: \"This striving for perfection will carry over into other areas of their lives.\"<ref name=Better/>  In December 1964, Revelli described the guiding principles that he sought to instill into his students for 36 years.  In a speech delivered to the Marching Band prior to its appearance at the 1964 [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] game (and published in its entirety in the October 1994 issue of Michigan\u2019s alumni magazine ''Michigan Today''), Revelli said:\n\n\"Demand of yourself! How much do you demand of yourself of what I'm talking about? Not even 10 percent, some of you. ... I want to know how you can dedicate yourself to your forthcoming positions in the musical world, when you can't dedicate yourself right now to what you're doing in a simple little march. ... The world is full of people who do things just about right. Just about. And a few on the top do them just right\u2014most of the time. Nobody's perfect! When are you going to start to demand of yourself what I demand of myself? When are you going to be as uncompromising with what you do as I am uncompromising in what I hear and what I insist on? When? Are you waiting for some miracle? The miracle will be when you demand of yourself everything you've got of yourself. That'll be the day. And I don't only mean 5 minutes of 10; I mean 10 minutes out of 10; I mean 60 minutes out of an hour, 24 hours a day, at least all of your waking hours. ... I don't want it just about right! To me, just about right is terrible! ... Now, nobody's killed when you play a half-note as a dotted quarter. But you might, from learning to play a half-note a full half-note, make the difference in the lives of 50,000 little kids. ... You don't piddle with music\u2014it's a good-time-Charlie business, and for me, the wonderful good times come out of hearing somebody play beautifully. I don't care if it's \u2018[[Stars and Stripes Forever|Stars and Stripes]],\u2019 \u2018[[The Victors]]\u2019 or what it is. I mean, there's a pride. And this guy knows he's good! And nobody can take that away from him. When they play sloppy and don't care or don't know\u2014a great many of them don't even know, they don't know how bad it is\u2014they can be forgiven, but more they should be pitied.\u201d<ref name=Zucker/>\n\nRevelli also viewed school bands as a bulwark against juvenile delinquency.  He noted: \"We keep our musicians too interested and busy to get into mischief.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=High School Girls Participate In All-Star Ensemble|publisher=News-Palladium (Benton Harbor)|date=1955-07-25}}</ref>  On another occasion, he noted, \"Young music students have better things to do than get in trouble.\"<ref name=Better>{{cite news|title=Young WSC Musicians Perform Well|newspaper=Ogden Standard-Examiner|date=1966-08-13}}</ref>\n\n===Development of the Michigan Bands===\n[[File:Revelli3.jpg|thumb|220px|right|William Revelli, 1956]]\nRevelli recruited talented musicians to Michigan like a football coach recruited top athletes.   Revelli required all male wind instrument majors to participate in the Marching Band.  This requirement swelled the number of students in the Marching Band.<ref name=MMB>{{cite web|title=The Michigan Marching Band: The William Revelli Years 1935-1971|url=http://mmb.music.umich.edu/history/revelli.asp|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118160208/http://mmb.music.umich.edu/history/revelli.asp|archivedate=2008-01-18}}</ref> Revelli was also known for his use of new music in his performances, often commissioning new pieces.<ref name=Man/> Another innovation during Revelli\u2019s years as band director was the introduction of dance steps.  The tradition began with a dance routine to the tune [[Alexander's Ragtime Band]] which proved to be a big hit with the crowd.<ref name=MMB/>\n\nIn the 1930s, [[General Motors]] divisions, [[Buick]] and [[Chevrolet]], paid for the band to travel to away games.  In a show of appreciation, Revelli had the band line up in a \u201cBuck \u2013 I\u201d formation at the 1938 Ohio State game.  Then, while playing Buick\u2019s theme song, the letter \"I\" moved between the \"u\" and the \"c\" in \"Buck\" spelling out \"Buick\".  The next morning, athletic director [[Fielding H. Yost]] reportedly called Revelli at his home at 2:00&nbsp;a.m. and said: \"Young man,  never do that again!\u201d  Yost did not approve of the injection of commercial advertising onto the college football field.<ref name=MMB/>\n\nRevelli was also dedicated to furthering musical education in high schools.  He regularly toured the Midwest offering band clinics in small towns and big cities.  In 1949, Revelli held the first Band Day at [[Michigan Stadium]]. Twenty-nine high school bands marched into the stadium and played with the Michigan Marching Band under the direction of Revelli. By the 1960s, the number of Band Day participants had grown to more than 14,000.<ref name=Man/><ref name=MMB/> \nRevelli was also the Chairman of the Instrumental Winds Department at the University of Michigan.<ref name=Man/>  He was an advocate within the School of Music for wind music.  Aside from directing the large ensembles, Revelli promoted chamber music as well as the importance of private instruction on each student\u2019s wind instrument at the University.  Starting in 1942, Revelli offered the \u201cSmall Wood-wind ensemble,\u201d as a way to encourage wind chamber music.  The vision of professor Revelli helped bring in teachers for every wind instrument and paved the way for the University of Michigan to become one of the premiere music institutions in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=School of Music Wind Instruments|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nzeisler/History/|access-date=2008-01-29|archive-url=https://archive.is/20071021073420/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~nzeisler/History/|archive-date=2007-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, the band moved to Harris Hall. Revelli joked that the band was making \"progress\" as it moved from a building built in 1854\u2014Morris Hall\u2014to one built in 1888.   The large upstairs room with its plaster walls and wooden floor provided the perfect acoustical setting for a band rehearsal. Revelli later said the \"Michigan Band sound\" was in part due to the perfect acoustics of Harris Hall and [[Hill Auditorium]].\n\nIn 1961, Revelli and the U-M Symphony Band, under sponsorship of the [[U.S. State Department]], toured the [[Soviet Union]], [[Romania]], [[Egypt]], [[Greece]], and five other Near East countries for 15 weeks.<ref name=State>{{cite news|title=5 Area Schools Participating In Music Clinic, Concert Here|newspaper=The Lima News|date=1962-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=University of Michigan Band Tours Bucharest|newspaper=Holland Evening Sentinel|date=1961-05-17}}</ref>  One of the attendees at the USSR concert in Minsk, USSR - according to the Warren Commission report - was none other than Lee Harvey Oswald - the reported assassin of John F.

Schembechler said, \u201cHe didn't just teach them \u2018The Victors.\u2019 He taught them Michigan tradition!\u201d<ref name=Bacon/>  Schembechler gathered the freshmen at [[Yost Ice Arena|Yost Field House]], and Revelli entered in full uniform \u2013 described by Schembechler as \u201ca lean, short, distinguished-looking older gentleman\u2014a band director right out of [[central casting]].\u201d<ref name=Bacon/>  Revelli rose to the podium, tapped his [[Baton (conducting)|baton]], looked right into their eyes and said, \"[[John Philip Sousa]] called this the greatest fight song ever written.  And you will sing it with respect!\"<ref name=Bacon/>  Revelli brought out a [[pitch pipe]] and began the instructions.  \u201cYou sing from down in here, in your [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]].  You bring it up from down here with feeling.\u201d  Then he blew the starting note on his pitch pipe.  The players started, \"Hail to the Victors, valiant \u2013\"  Revelli interrupted, \u201cNo, No, No!  That\u2019s terrible!  There\u2019s no enthusiasm  You didn\u2019t sing with enthusiasm!\u201d<ref name=Brandstatter/>  They started again, and Revelli interrupted again.  \u201cNo, no, no!  We\u2019re gonna get this right if I\u2019m here all night!\u201d<ref name=Brandstatter/>\n\nSchembechler thought so much of Revelli\u2019s performance that he invited him back every year to teach the freshmen what Michigan tradition was about.<ref name=Bacon/>  Schembechler recalled, \u201cHe was absolutely great, and the freshmen absolutely loved it.  And let me tell you, every one of those freshmen came out of that session with Revelli knowing \u2018The Victors.\u2019  They knew the words, they knew how to sing it, and they knew how to emphasize the right spots.  They flat out knew how to do it.  And it was only because he came over there with the idea that those guys were going to come out of that meeting room knowing how to sing this fight song the right way or else!  And they did.  That was Bill Revelli.\u201d<ref name=Brandstatter/>\n\nThe admiration between Revelli and Schembechler was mutual.  In a 1970 interview, Revelli compared himself and his training methods to those of Schembechler.  \"Bo and I speak the same language.  Psychologically, our practices are the same.  Both the team and the band have to perfect their fundamentals before they can do anything else.  And both need proper warmups to stay in shape in the off-season.  Sometimes we'll spend 45 minutes on [[calisthenics]] of the [[embouchure]] (perfecting the position of the lips on the mouthpiece of an instrument).  I had one boy come back who hadn't practiced all summer.  His lips were about six months behind everyone else's.\"<ref name=OSU/>\n\n==College Band Directors National Association==\nRevelli was the founder of the College Band Directors National Association (CBDNA) in 1941. The CBDNA  began as a committee of the Music Educators National Conference (MENC). In the fall of 1938 that committee, under the leadership of Revelli, met independently in Chicago. The group met again in December 1941 and formed the University and College Band Conductors Conference.

Another example is the RR protocol used in GSM cell phones, defined in 3GPP 04.18.\n\nIn the RR protocol, each message is defined as a sequence of information elements. \n\nMany other protocols use TLVs, such as [[Common Open Policy Service|COPS]], [[IS-IS]], and [[RADIUS]], and data storage formats such as [[Interchange File Format|IFF]] and [[QuickTime File Format|QTFF]] (the basis for [[ISO/IEC base media file format|MPEG-4 containers]]).\n\n==Other ways of representing data==\nCore [[TCP/IP]] protocols (particularly [[Internet Protocol|IP]], [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], and [[User_Datagram_Protocol|UDP]]) use predefined, static fields.\n\nCommon [[TCP/IP]]-based protocols such as [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]], [[Post Office Protocol|POP3]], and [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] use text-based \"Field: Value\" pairs formatted according to [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822 RFC 2822].\n\n[[ASN.1]] specifies several TLV-based encoding rules ([[Basic Encoding Rules|BER]], [[Distinguished Encoding Rules|DER]]), as well as non-TLV based ones ([[Packed Encoding Rules|PER]], [[XML Encoding Rules|XER]]).\n\n[[CSN.1]] describes encoding rules using non-TLV semantics.\n\nMore recently, [[XML]] has been used to implement messaging between different nodes in a network. These messages are typically prefixed with line-based text commands, such as with [[BEEP]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Common Open Policy Service]] (COPS)\n*[[IS-IS]]\n*[[Shortest Path Bridging]]\n*[[KLV]], for a very similar key-length-value scheme\n*[[Link Layer Discovery Protocol]]\n*[[RADIUS]]\n*[[OBject_EXchange|OBEX]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://tlve.sourceforge.net/ tlve], A common TLV parser\n\n[[Category:Data transmission]]\n[[Category:Internet Standards]]\n[[Category:Internet protocols]]\n[[Category:Data serialization formats]]\n", "name_user": "Todd Vierling", "label": "safe", "comment": "make the grammar of previous a little less awkward", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value"}

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles' directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed.

You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare.

And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column, \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name was not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it.

The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out.

More than an hour of footage was cut by the studio, which also shot and substituted a happier ending. Although Welles's extensive notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the excised footage was destroyed.

Eugene Morgan is a young man who is courting Isabel Amberson, but she rejects him after he publicly embarrasses her. Isabel instead marries Wilbur Minafer, a passionless man she does not love. They have a child, George, whom she spoils and who becomes the terror of the town. The townspeople long to see George get his 'comeuppance'.\n\nGeorge Minafer returns home from college during the holidays and attends a large party at the Amberson mansion hosted by his grandfather, Major Amberson. Among the guests are Eugene Morgan, now a widower who has just returned to town after a 20-year absence, and his daughter, Lucy. George instantly takes to the beautiful and charming Lucy but intensely dislikes Eugene, whom he sees as a social climber. He also ridicules Eugene's investment in the [[automobile]].\n\nThe next day, George, his aunt Fanny, Isabel, and Isabel's brother, Jack, take a sleigh ride. They pass Eugene and Lucy, whose \"horseless carriage\" has gotten stuck in the snow and George jeers for them to \"get a horse\".  The Amberson sleigh then overturns, and Eugene (his vehicle now mobile again) gives everyone a ride back to the Minafer mansion. George is humiliated during the incident and angered by Eugene's attentions toward Isabel as well as his mother's obvious affection for Eugene.\n\nGeorge returns to college. Wilbur Minafer loses a substantial amount of money on bad investments, and soon afterward dies. George is largely unmoved by his father's death. The night after the funeral, George cruelly teases Fanny, who is besotted with Eugene.\n\nTime passes, and Eugene becomes very wealthy in automobile manufacturing. Eugene also begins to court Isabel. One summer, he asks Isabel to tell George about their love, but she refuses, unwilling to risk her son's disapproval. Meanwhile, George proposes to Lucy. She rejects him, saying he has no ambition in life other than to be wealthy and keep things as they are. George blames Eugene for turning Lucy against him. Lucy leaves town soon after, and the Ambersons invite the lonely Eugene to dinner. During the meal, George nastily criticizes automobiles in front of Eugene. The other family members are taken aback by his rudeness, but Eugene says that George may turn out to be right. That evening, George learns from his aunt Fanny that Eugene has been courting Isabel. George's uncle Jack confirms Fanny's revelation. Enraged, George rudely confronts a neighbor for spreading gossip about his mother. The next day, George refuses to let Eugene see his mother. Jack tells Isabel about George's terrible behavior, but she declines to do anything which might upset her son. Eugene writes to Isabel, asking her to choose between her son and his love. Isabel chooses George.\n\nLucy returns home in time to discover that George is taking his mother to Europe on an extended trip. George talks to Lucy in an attempt to discover if she loves him. She feigns indifference to his absence, and they part. Lucy is heartbroken, however, and faints.\n\nMonths pass. Jack Amberson returns from Europe and tells Eugene that Isabel is seriously ill. George, however, will not allow her to come home because he fears she will renew her relationship with Eugene. When Isabel starts to die, George finally relents and he and his mother return to Indianapolis. Eugene tries to see her, but George refuses to let him into the house. Eugene leaves when Fanny tells him that Isabel is on her deathbed. Isabel dies while holding George's hand, begging to see Eugene one last time.\n\nShortly after Isabel's death, Major Amberson learns he has only a short time to live. George is too self-centered and preoccupied with his own problems, and ignores his grandfather's revelation. Major Amberson dies, and the family learns his estate is worthless and there are numerous large debts. Jack leaves town to take a job in another city. George tells Fanny that he intends to live on her income, but she reveals that she lost everything after making bad investments. With the utilities having been turned off and the Amberson home and all their belongings soon to be sold, George and Fanny discover they have only a few hundred dollars to live on for the rest of the year.\n\nEugene asks Lucy if she will reconcile with George. Lucy instead tells her father a story about an [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] chieftain who was \"pushed out on a canoe into the sea\" when he became too obnoxious and overbearing, which Eugene understands to be an analogy for George.\n\nPenniless, George gives up his job as a clerk at Roger Bronson's law firm, and finds entry-level but high-paying employment in a dynamite factory. This gives him enough money to live on and take care of Fanny. George wanders the newly-industrialized city, dazed by the modern society that has grown up around him. In his last night in the Amberson family home, George prays desperately by his dead mother's bed. The narrator says that no one is around to see George Minafer receive his comeuppance.\n\nThe next day, George is struck by an automobile and seriously injured. In the film's final scenes, Lucy is seen in the hospital at George's bedside, having reconciled with him. Eugene and Fanny walk arm in arm down the hospital corridor, as Eugene says that George and Fanny's financial security is what Isabel would have wanted.\n\n==Cast==\n<!-- Credited actors as billed in film per [[WP:FILMCAST]] -->\n<!-- Do not add others unless cited for [[Wikipedia:Notability]]-->\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Eugene Morgan\n* [[Dolores Costello]] as Isabel Amberson Minafer\n* [[Anne Baxter]] as Lucy Morgan\n* [[Tim Holt]] as George Amberson Minafer\n* [[Agnes Moorehead]] as Fanny Minafer\n* [[Ray Collins (actor)|Ray Collins]] as Jack Amberson\n* [[Erskine Sanford]] as Roger Bronson\n* [[Richard Bennett (actor)|Richard Bennett]] as Major Amberson\n* [[Don Dillaway]] as Wilbur Minafer\n* [[Orson Welles]] as narrator\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Adaptation history===\nWelles first adapted ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' for a one-hour radio drama performed October 29, 1939, by his [[Mercury Theatre|Mercury Players]] on ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'', with Orson Welles portraying George Minafer, and providing narration.

In rehearsal, Welles told Moorehead (who was still a novice to film acting) to \"play it like a little girl,\" a characterization which went against what Moorehead had prepared. Then Welles told her to play \"like an insane woman.\" Following that Welles told her to play it \"like she's absolutely inebriated.\" Then he said to play with \"an absolutely vacuous mind.\" Moorehead was thinking to herself \"What in the world does he want?\" She did the scene 11 times, each with a different characterization. For the twelfth time, Welles told Moorehead:  \"Now play it.\" After those rehearsals, her playing the scene had \"a little bit of the hysteria, it had a little bit of the insanity, it had a little bit of the little girl...he had mixed it all up in my mind so that the characterization that I played had a little bit of all of these; and it was terribly exciting.\"  Moorehead continued reflecting on Welles' directorial abilities:  \"He never directed obviously; he always directed in some strange oblique way where you thought 'Well, that isn't right at all.' But if you put your career or the role in his hands he loved to mold you the way he wanted and it was always much better than you could do yourself. He was the most exciting director that you could possibly imagine.\"<ref>{{cite interview|first=Agnes|last=Moorehead|subjectlink=Agnes Moorhead|interviewer=[[Dick Cavett]]|title=[[The Dick Cavett Show]]|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]|location=New York City|date=February 19, 1973}}</ref>\n\nThe original rough cut of the film was approximately 135 minutes in length. Welles felt that the film needed to be shortened and, after receiving a mixed response from a March 17 preview audience in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], film editor [[Robert Wise]] removed several minutes from it.<ref name=\"tcmarticle\">{{cite web |first1=Frank|last1=Miller|first2=Lang|last2=Thompson|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=683&category=Articles |title=Why 'The Magnificent Ambersons' is Essential|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|publisher=[[Turner Broadcasting Systems]]|location=Atlanta, Georgia|accessdate=May 20, 2009|quote=The standard story is that the audience was hostile and disapproving, which sent the studio into a panic over what they considered Welles's excesses. But the critic and historian Jonathan Rosenbaum has examined the 125 original comment cards and reports that 53 were positive; many were overwhelmingly enthusiastic. }}</ref> The film was previewed again, but the audience's response did not improve.\n\nBecause Welles had conceded his original contractual right to the final cut (in a negotiation with RKO over a film which he was obliged to direct but never did), RKO took over editing once Welles had delivered a first cut. RKO deleted more than 40 additional minutes and reshot the ending in late April and early May, in changes directed by assistant director [[Fred Fleck]], Robert Wise, and [[Jack Moss]], the business manager of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]]. The retakes replaced Welles' original ending with a happier one that broke significantly with the film's elegiac tone. The reshot ending is the same as in the novel.\n\nWelles did not approve of the cuts, but because he was simultaneously working in Brazil on ''[[It's All True (film)|It's All True]]'' for RKO\u2014[[Nelson Rockefeller]] had personally asked him to make a film in Latin America as part of the wartime [[Good Neighbor Policy]]<ref name=\"tcmarticle\"/>\u2014his attempts to protect his version ultimately failed. Details of Welles' conflict over the editing are included in the 1993 documentary about ''It's All True''.<ref name=\"AFI\">{{cite web |url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/27328 |title=The Magnificent Ambersons |website=[[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n\"Of course I expected that there would be an uproar about a picture which, by any ordinary American standards, was much darker than anybody was making pictures,\" Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. \"There was just a built-in dread of the downbeat movie, and I knew I'd have that to face, but I thought I had a movie so good\u2014I was absolutely certain of its value, much more than of  ''Kane'' ... It's a tremendous preparation for the boardinghouse ... and the terrible walk of George Minafer when he gets his comeuppance. And without that, there wasn't any plot. It's all about some rich people fighting in their house.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\">{{cite book |first=Barbara|last=Leaming |title=Orson Welles, A Biography |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=New York City|date=1985 |isbn=978-0-618-15446-3}}</ref>{{Rp|244\u2013245}}\n\nWelles said he would not have gone to South America without the studio's guarantee that he could finish editing ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' there. \"And they absolutely betrayed me and never gave me a shot at it. You know, all I could do was send wires ... But I couldn't walk out on a job which had diplomatic overtones. I was representing America in Brazil, you see. I was a prisoner of the Good Neighbor Policy. That's what made it such a nightmare. I couldn't walk out on [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Mr. Roosevelt]]'s Good Neighbor Policy with the biggest single thing that they'd done on the cultural level, and simply walk away. And I couldn't get my film in my hands.\"<ref name=\"Leaming OW\"/>{{Rp|245}}\n\nThe negatives for the excised portions of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' were later destroyed in order to free vault space. A print of the rough cut sent to Welles in Brazil has yet to be found and is generally considered to be [[lost film|lost]], along with the prints from the previews. Robert Wise maintained that the original was not better than the edited version.\n\nThe film features what could be considered an [[In-joke|inside joke]]: news of the increase in automobile accidents is featured prominently on the front page of the ''[[Indianapolis Daily Inquirer]]'', part of the fictional chain of newspapers owned by mogul [[Charles Foster Kane]] in ''Citizen Kane''. Also appearing on the front page is the column, \"Stage News\", by [[Citizen Kane#Jedediah Leland|the fictional writer Jed Leland]], with a photo of [[Joseph Cotten]], who portrayed Leland in the earlier film.\n\n===Budget===\nThe budget for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was set at $853,950, roughly the final cost of ''Citizen Kane''. During shooting the film went over budget by 19 percent ($159,810), bringing the cost of the Welles cut to $1,013,760. RKO's subsequent changes cost $104,164. The total cost of the motion picture was $1,117,924.<ref name=\"McBride\"/>{{Rp|71\u201372|April 2014}}\n\n===Score===\nLike the film itself, [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s score for ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' was heavily edited by RKO. When more than half of his score was removed from the soundtrack, Herrmann bitterly severed his ties with the film and promised legal action if his name were not removed from the credits.<ref>Husted, Christopher, liner notes for ''The Magnificent Ambersons: Original 1942 Motion Picture Score'', Preamble (PRCD 1783), Fifth Continent Music Corp. 1990</ref>\n\n===Spoken credits===\n[[File:Citizen-Kane-Microphone.jpg|thumb|left|\"I wrote the script and directed it. My name is Orson Welles. This is a Mercury Production.\"]]\n''The Magnificent Ambersons'' is one of the earliest films in movie history in which nearly all the credits are spoken by an off-screen voice and not shown printed onscreen\u2014a technique used before only by the French director and player [[Sacha Guitry]]. The only credits shown onscreen are the RKO logo, \"A Mercury Production by Orson Welles\", and the film's title, shown at the beginning of the picture. At the end of the film, Welles's voice announces all the main credits. Each actor in the film is shown as Welles announces his or her name. As he speaks each technical credit, a machine is shown performing that function.<ref name=\"AFI\"/> Welles reads his own credit \u2014 \"My name is Orson Welles\" \u2014 over top of an image of a microphone which then recedes into the distance.<ref>The footage of the microphone is taken from the [[Citizen Kane trailer|trailer for ''Citizen Kane'']] in which Welles similarly narrated the key acting credits for the film.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/the-magnificent-ambersons/ |title=The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)  |publisher=[[Art of the Title]] |accessdate=September 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\n\"I got a lot of hell because of that,\" Welles later said of his verbal sign-off. \"People think it's egotistic. The truth is, I was just speaking to a public who knew me from [[The Mercury Theatre on the Air|the radio]] in a way they were used to hearing on our shows. In those days we had an enormous public \u2014 in the millions \u2014 who heard us every week, so it didn't seem pompous to end a movie in our radio style.\"<ref name=\"Welles TIOW\">{{cite book|first1=Orson|last1=Welles|authorlink1=Orson Welles|first2=Peter|last2=Bogdanovich|authorlink2=Peter Bogdanovich|editor-first=Jonathan|editor-last=Rosenbaum|editorlink=Jonathan Rosenbaum|title=This is Orson Welles|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=New York City|date=1992|ISBN=0-06-016616-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/thisisorsonwelle0000well}}</ref>{{Rp|130\u2013131|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Welles's 1970s revisit===\nIn conversations (1969\u20131975) with [[Peter Bogdanovich]] compiled in ''[[This Is Orson Welles]]'', Welles confirmed that he had planned to reshoot the ending of ''The Magnificent Ambersons'' with the principal cast members who were still living:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Yes, I had an outside chance to finish it again just a couple of years ago, but I couldn't swing it. The fellow who was going to buy the film for me disappeared from view. The idea was to take the actors who are still alive now\u2014Cotten, Baxter, Moorehead, Holt\u2014and do quite a new end to the movie, twenty years after. Maybe that way we could have got a new release and a large audience to see it for the first time.\n\nYou see, the basic intention was to portray a golden world\u2014almost one of memory\u2014and then show what it turns into. Having set up this dream town of the \"good old days,\" the whole point was to show the automobile wrecking it\u2014not only the family but the town. All this is out. What's left is only the first six reels. Then there's a kind of arbitrary bringing back down the curtain by a series of clumsy, quick devices. The bad, black world was supposed to be too much for people. My whole third act is lost because of all the hysterical tinkering that went on. And it ''was'' hysterical. Everybody they could find was cutting it.<ref name=\"Welles TIOW\"/>{{Rp|114|date=December 2012}}</poem></blockquote>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Box office===\nThe film managed to earn $1 million in rentals in the U.S. and Canada, according to ''Variety''.<ref name=\"variety\"/> However it was not enough to recoup the film's cost and it recorded a loss of $620,000.<ref name=\"rko\">Richard Jewell, 'RKO Film Grosses: 1931-1951', ''Historical Journal of Film Radio and Television'', Vol 14 No 1, 1994 p45</ref>\n\n===Critical reception===\n''The Magnificent Ambersons'' is regarded as one of Welles's masterpieces.
