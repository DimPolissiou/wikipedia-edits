The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on \"family-oriented entertainment\", and features no [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|R-rated]], [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|NC-17-rated]] or [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-MA|TV-MA-rated]] programming.\n\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and the [[Netherlands]]. The service was expanded to [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Puerto Rico]] a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. Further expansions are planned for Europe, India and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation, and the service has 28.6 million subscribers {{as of|2020|02|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future.

The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] and [[Walt Disney Television]], with the service advertising content from Disney's [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]], [[National Geographic Partners|National Geographic]], [[Pixar]], and ''[[Lucasfilm|Star Wars]]'' brands in particular. [[List of original films distributed by Disney+|Original films]] and [[List of original programs distributed by Disney+|television series]] are also distributed on Disney+, with ten films and seven series having been produced for the platform {{As of|2019|11|lc=y}}. Serving adjacent to Disney's other streaming platforms \u2013 the general programming-oriented [[Hulu]] and the sports-oriented [[ESPN+]] \u2013 Disney+ focuses on \"family-oriented entertainment\", and features no [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|R-rated]], [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Ratings|NC-17-rated]] or [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-MA|TV-MA-rated]] programming.\n\nDisney+ relies on technology developed by [[Disney Streaming Services]], originally established as BAMTech in 2015, when it was spun off from [[MLB Advanced Media]] (MLBAM). Disney increased its ownership share of BAMTech to a controlling stake in 2017, and subsequently transferred ownership to DTCI as part of a corporate restructure in anticipation of Disney's [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquisition of 21st Century Fox]]. With BAMTech helping to launch ESPN+ in early 2018, and Disney's streaming distribution deal with [[Netflix]] ending in 2019, Disney took the opportunity to use technologies being developed for ESPN+ to establish a Disney-branded streaming service that would feature its content. Production of films and television shows to feature exclusively on the platform began in late 2017; [[Marvel's Netflix television series|Marvel's original series for Netflix]] were cancelled in favor of [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#Disney+ series|Marvel Cinematic Universe series for Disney+]].\n\nDisney+ debuted on November 12, 2019, in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and the [[Netherlands]]. The service was expanded to [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Puerto Rico]] a week later, and expanded to select European countries in March 2020. Further expansions are planned for Europe, and Latin America in mid 2020 through 2021, as Disney's existing international streaming distribution deals with competing services expire. Upon launch, the service was met with positive reception of its content library, but was criticized for technical problems. Alterations made to movies and TV shows also attracted media attention. Ten million users subscribed to Disney+ within its first day of operation, and the service has 28.6 million subscribers {{as of|2020|02|lc=y}}.\n\n==History==\nIn August 2016, Disney acquired a minority stake in [[BAMTech]] (a [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of [[MLB Advanced Media]]'s streaming technology business) for $1 billion, with an option to acquire a majority stake in the future. Following the purchase, [[ESPN]] announced plans for an \"exploratory [over-the-top] project\" based on its technology ([[ESPN+]]) to supplant its existing linear television services.<ref name=\"variety-disneybam\">{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |title=What's Behind Disney's $1 Billion Investment in Major League Baseball's Digital Arm |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=August 18, 2016 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=December 18, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220192059/http://variety.com/2016/digital/news/disney-major-league-baseball-digital-deal-1201838818/ |archive-date=December 20, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |title=Walt Disney Co. buys stake in video streaming service BAMTech |last=Miller |first=Daniel |date=August 9, 2016 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=August 17, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817040954/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-disney-earnings-20160809-snap-story.html |archive-date=August 17, 2016}}</ref> On August 8, 2017, Disney invoked its option to acquire a controlling stake in BAMTech for $1.58 billion, increasing its stake to 75%.
