In particular, pain intensity, pain control, and resiliency to pain has been implicated as outcomes influenced by different levels and types of social support. Much of this research has focused on emotional, instrumental, tangible and informational social support. People with persistent pain conditions tend to rely on their social support as a coping mechanism and therefore have better outcomes when they are a part of larger more supportive social networks. Across a majority of studies investigated, there was a direct significant association between social activities or social support and pain.

In particular, pain intensity, pain control, and resiliency to pain has been implicated as outcomes influenced by different levels and types of social support. Much of this research has focused on emotional, instrumental, tangible and informational social support. People with persistent pain conditions tend to rely on their social support as a coping mechanism and therefore have better outcomes when they are a part of larger more supportive social networks. Across a majority of studies investigated, there was a direct significant association between social activities or social support and pain. Higher levels of pain were associated with a decrease in social activities, lower levels of social support, and reduced social functioning.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Molton IR, Terrill AL | title = Overview of persistent pain in older adults | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 197\u2013207 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24547805 | doi = 10.1037/a0035794 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zaza C, Baine N | title = Cancer pain and psychosocial factors: a critical review of the literature | journal = Journal of Pain and Symptom Management | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 526\u201342 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12547052 | doi = 10.1016/s0885-3924(02)00497-9 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Effect on cognition===\nChronic pain's impact on cognition is an under-researched area, but several tentative conclusions have been published. Most people with chronic pain complain of cognitive impairment, such as forgetfulness, difficulty with attention, and difficulty completing tasks.
