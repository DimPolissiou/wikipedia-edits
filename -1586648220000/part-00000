Television producer [[Craig Plestis]] explained that he first discovered the format during a visit to a small [[Los Angeles]] Thai restaurant in {{nobr|October 2017.}} While waiting for dinner, he observed that the other patrons were all staring at a television while an episode of [[The Mask Singer (season 3)|third season]] of the [[The Mask Singer (Thai TV series)|Thai version]] of the show was playing. Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. Plestis then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night telling him he needed to come in the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend.

It has also been associated with the \"idol of jealousy\" erected in the temple of Jerusalem according to the [[Book of Ezekiel]], which was offered an oblation of barley-meal by the husband who suspected his wife of infidelity. It can be inferred from [[Hisham ibn al-Kalbi|al-Kalbi]]'s ''[[Book of Idols]]'' that a similar ritual was practiced in the vicinity of the image of al-Lat.<ref name=\"EI2\" /> Another etymology takes al-Lat to be the feminine form of [[Allah]].<ref name=\"EI2\" /> She may have been known originally as ''\u02bfal-\u02bfilat'', based on Herodotus' attestation of the goddess as ''Alilat''.{{Sfn|Healey|2001|p=112}} \n\nAl-Lat was used as a title for the goddess [[Asherah]] or [[Asherah|Athirat]].{{sfn|Monaghan|2014|p=31}}  The word is akin to [[Asherah|Elat]], which was the name of the wife of the Semitic deity [[El (deity)|El]].{{sfn|Sykes|Turner|2014|p=7, 8, 63}} A western Semitic goddess modeled on the Mesopotamian goddess [[Ereshkigal]] was known as ''Allatum'', and she was recognized in [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] as [[Allatu]].{{Sfn|Jordan|2014|p=13}}\n\n== Attestations ==\n\n=== Pre-Islamic era ===\nAl-Lat was mentioned as ''Alilat'' by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in his 5th-century BC work ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'', and she was considered the equivalent of [[Aphrodite]] ([[Aphrodite Urania]]):<ref name=\":0\">Corrente, Paola, \"Dushara and All\u0101t alias Dionysos and Aphrodite in Herodotus 3.8\", in {{Harvnb|Bernab\u00e9|J\u00e1uregui|Crist\u00f3bal|Hern\u00e1ndez|2013|pp=265, 266}}</ref>{{quote|The [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]] call Aphrodite ''[[Mylitta]]'', the [[Arabians]] ''Alilat'' [Greek spelling: \u1f08\u03bb\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4], and the [[Persian people|Persians]] ''[[Mithra]]''.<ref>[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] I:131</ref>|sign=|source=}}\nAccording to Herodotus, the ancient Arabians believed in only two gods:\n{{quote|They believe in no other gods except [[Dionysus]] and the Heavenly Aphrodite; and they say that they wear their hair as Dionysus does his, cutting it round the head and shaving the temples.

It has also been associated with the \"idol of jealousy\" erected in the temple of Jerusalem according to the [[Book of Ezekiel]], which was offered an oblation of barley-meal by the husband who suspected his wife of infidelity.

He announced the promotion's formation at John Arezzi's ''Wrestling Fans Fantasy Weekend'' convention in August 1990. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 134.</ref> The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Ivan Koloff]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Paul Orndorff]], and [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick.

[[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues.

''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992 that aired on [[Prime Ticket]] as ''Thunder Hour'', a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993 that was never aired, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> [[ESPN2]] aired old episodes of ''Fury Hour'' and ''Thunder Hour'' in 1995, albeit in heavily edited form.

The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|executive_producer = Lenny Duge\n|starring = See [[List of former Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) personnel|UWF alumni]]\n|country = United States\n|location = [[Reseda Country Club]] <small>(1990)</small><br>[[New York Penta]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Universal Studios Florida]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[War Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]] <small>(1990-1991)</small><br>[[Prime Ticket]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|first_aired = October 1, 1990\n|last_aired = September 13, 1992\n|num_episodes = 69\n|list_episodes = List of UWF Fury Hour episodes\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year television deal with [[SportsChannel America]].

He announced the promotion's formation at John Arezzi's ''Wrestling Fans Fantasy Weekend'' convention in August 1990. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 134.</ref> The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Ivan Koloff]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Paul Orndorff]], and [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.184)</ref> The top homegrown talent included \"Wild Thing\" Steve Ray and \"Cutie Pie\" [[Louie Spicolli]]. [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company. Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992 that aired on [[Prime Ticket]] as ''Thunder Hour'', a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993 that was never aired, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> [[ESPN2]] aired old episodes of ''Fury Hour'' and ''Thunder Hour'' in 1995, albeit in heavily edited form.

The disease is usually latent, occurring up to 6 months after the acute infection, but may occasionally be the presenting symptom of rheumatic fever. Sydenham's chorea is more common in females than males and most below 16 years of age. Adult onset of Sydenham's chorea is comparatively rare, and the majority of the adult cases are associated with exacerbation of [[chorea]] following childhood Sydenham's chorea.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSydenham's chorea is characterized by the abrupt onset (sometimes within a few hours) of neurologic symptoms, classically [[chorea]], usually affecting all four limbs. Other neurologic symptoms include behavior change, [[dysarthria]], gait disturbance, loss of fine and gross motor control with resultant deterioration of handwriting, [[headache]], slowed cognition, facial grimacing, fidgetiness and [[hypotonia]].<ref name=Chun/><ref name=Chan/> Also, there may be tongue [[fasciculations]] (\"bag of worms\") and a \"milk sign\", which is a relapsing grip demonstrated by alternate increases and decreases in tension, as if [[hand milking]].<ref>[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/891897-clinical#a0217 Medscape > Pediatric Rheumatic Heart Disease Clinical Presentation > Noncardiac manifestations].

Such progress was promoted by the availability of large series of clinical data provided by newly founded paediatric hospitals. A 2005 study examined the demographic and clinical features of patients with chorea admitted to the first British paediatric hospital (the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London]]) between 1852 and 1936. The seasonal and demographic characteristics of Sydenham's chorea during this time appear strikingly similar to those observed today, [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street hospital]] case notes provide detailed descriptions of the \"typical cases\" of Sydenham's chorea, and show that British physicians working in the early age of paediatric hospitals recognized the most distinctive clinical features of this condition.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author1=D Martino |author2=A Tanner |author3=G Defazio |author4=A J Church |author5=K P Bhatia |author6=G Giovannoni |author7=R C Dale |title=Tracing Sydenham's chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease in Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507\u2013511 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15851434|doi= 10.1136/adc.2004.057679|url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full |pmc=1720385}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century the term \"[[chorea]]\" referred to an ill-defined spectrum of [[hyperkinesia]]s, including those recognised today as chorea, [[tic]]s, [[dystonia]], or [[myoclonus]]. [[William Osler]] stated, \"In the whole range of medical terminology there is no such [[olla podrida]] as Chorea, which for a century has served as a sort of nosological pot into which authors have cast indiscriminately affections characterised by irregular, purposeless movements.\"<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nSydenham's chorea, a frequent cause of paediatric acute chorea, is a major manifestation of rheumatic fever. The association of chorea with rheumatism was first reported in 1802, and confirmed in the following decades by several French and English authors.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/> The inclusion of chorea under the rheumatic umbrella helped discriminate Sydenham's chorea from other \"choreic\" syndromes. The incidence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease is not declining. Recent figures quote the incidence of Acute Rheumatic Fever as 0.6\u20130.7/1,000 population in the United States and Japan compared with 15\u201321/1,000 population in Asia and Africa.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The prevalence of Acute Rheumatic Fever and Sydenham's Chorea has declined progressively in developed countries over the last decades.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nausieda PA, Grossman BJ, Koller WC, etal | year = 1980 | title = Sydenham's Chorea:An update | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 331\u2013334 | doi=10.1212/wnl.30.3.331| pmid = 7189038 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eshel E, Lahat E, Azizi E, etal | year = 1993 | title = Chorea as a manifestation of rheumatic fever-a 30-year survey | doi = 10.1007/bf01955239 | pmid = 8404967 | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 152 | issue = 8| pages = 645\u2013646 }}</ref> Physicians working in early children's hospitals recognised new clinical syndromes through the definition of \"typical clinical cases\". Complex multi-systemic diseases, such as rheumatic fever, were categorised only after the observation of large, hospital based series. Therefore, paediatric hospitals gradually became an important setting for the application of a modern \"statistical averaging\" technique to paediatric syndromes. Historical authorities in paediatrics, such as [[Walter Butler Cheadle]] and [[Octavius Sturges]], worked at London's Hospital for Sick Children, and their clinical notes help elucidate how the typical case of Sydenham's chorea was defined.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nBetween 1860 and 1900 the proportion of choreic patients ranged between 5% and 7% of the total number of patients admitted (mean per year, 1003), whereas from 1900 to 1936 it was constantly below 4% (mean per year). Chorea was the fourth most frequent cause of admission between 1860 and 1900, and in the 1880s temporarily became the second most frequent diagnosis among inpatients. Contemporary articles report a homogeneous distribution of paediatric chorea all over [[England]] However, since many choreic children were \"cured\" at home, the hospital based rates probably underestimate the incidence of chorea in the general paediatric population.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nA higher number of cases were admitted during the colder months, consistent with the reference epidemiological report on chorea at the end of the century. In the 1950s and 1960s the highest frequency of chorea was recorded during the winter months in several Northern and Central European countries. The incidence of rheumatism among Great Ormond Street Hospital inpatients peaked in October, preceding chorea by approximately two months. This is consistent with the current knowledge that most of the rheumatic fever symptoms appear about 10 days after the streptococcal infection, whereas Sydenham's chorea occurs typically 2\u20133 months after infection.\n\nMore than 80% of choreic patients were aged between 7 and 11 years (mean 9.2). Due to a referral bias, this age may be falsely low. Indeed, the British Medical Association (1887) reported the peak age between 11 and 15 years. In the present series, the female:male ratio was 2.7, in accordance with the general choreic population of Britain towards the end of the 1800s. In children below age 7, the female preponderance is less manifest. This was observed also by [[Charles West (physician)|Charles West]] (founder physician of Great Ormond Street Hospital), and subsequently by Osler, who stated that \"the second hemi-decade contains the greatest number of cases in males, and the third the greatest number in females\". In the majority of the 20th century studies, female preponderance is evident only in children over 10 years of age.

Such progress was promoted by the availability of large series of clinical data provided by newly founded paediatric hospitals. A 2005 study examined the demographic and clinical features of patients with chorea admitted to the first British paediatric hospital (the [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond Street, London]]) between 1852 and 1936. The seasonal and demographic characteristics of Sydenham's chorea during this time appear strikingly similar to those observed today, [[Great Ormond Street Hospital|Great Ormond Street hospital]] case notes provide detailed descriptions of the \"typical cases\" of Sydenham's chorea, and show that British physicians working in the early age of paediatric hospitals recognized the most distinctive clinical features of this condition.<ref name=PBJ>{{cite journal |author1=D Martino |author2=A Tanner |author3=G Defazio |author4=A J Church |author5=K P Bhatia |author6=G Giovannoni |author7=R C Dale |title=Tracing Sydenham's chorea: historical documents from a British paediatric hospital |journal=Disease in Childhood |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=507\u2013511 |date=October 2004 |pmid=15851434|doi= 10.1136/adc.2004.057679|url=http://adc.bmj.com/content/90/5/507.full |pmc=1720385}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the nineteenth century the term \"[[chorea]]\" referred to an ill-defined spectrum of [[hyperkinesia]]s, including those recognised today as chorea, [[tic]]s, [[dystonia]], or [[myoclonus]]. [[William Osler]] stated, \"In the whole range of medical terminology there is no such [[olla podrida]] as Chorea, which for a century has served as a sort of nosological pot into which authors have cast indiscriminately affections characterised by irregular, purposeless movements.\"<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nSydenham's chorea, a frequent cause of paediatric acute chorea, is a major manifestation of rheumatic fever. The association of chorea with rheumatism was first reported in 1802, and confirmed in the following decades by several French and English authors.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/> The inclusion of chorea under the rheumatic umbrella helped discriminate Sydenham's chorea from other \"choreic\" syndromes. The incidence of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease is not declining. Recent figures quote the incidence of Acute Rheumatic Fever as 0.6\u20130.7/1,000 population in the United States and Japan compared with 15\u201321/1,000 population in Asia and Africa.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The prevalence of Acute Rheumatic Fever and Sydenham's Chorea has declined progressively in developed countries over the last decades.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nausieda PA, Grossman BJ, Koller WC, etal | year = 1980 | title = Sydenham's Chorea:An update | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 30 | issue = 3| pages = 331\u2013334 | doi=10.1212/wnl.30.3.331| pmid = 7189038 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Eshel E, Lahat E, Azizi E, etal | year = 1993 | title = Chorea as a manifestation of rheumatic fever-a 30-year survey | doi = 10.1007/bf01955239 | pmid = 8404967 | journal = European Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 152 | issue = 8| pages = 645\u2013646 }}</ref> Physicians working in early children's hospitals recognised new clinical syndromes through the definition of \"typical clinical cases\". Complex multi-systemic diseases, such as rheumatic fever, were categorised only after the observation of large, hospital based series. Therefore, paediatric hospitals gradually became an important setting for the application of a modern \"statistical averaging\" technique to paediatric syndromes. Historical authorities in paediatrics, such as [[Walter Butler Cheadle]] and [[Octavius Sturges]], worked at London's Hospital for Sick Children, and their clinical notes help elucidate how the typical case of Sydenham's chorea was defined.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nBetween 1860 and 1900 the proportion of choreic patients ranged between 5% and 7% of the total number of patients admitted (mean per year, 1003), whereas from 1900 to 1936 it was constantly below 4% (mean per year). Chorea was the fourth most frequent cause of admission between 1860 and 1900, and in the 1880s temporarily became the second most frequent diagnosis among inpatients. Contemporary articles report a homogeneous distribution of paediatric chorea all over [[England]] However, since many choreic children were \"cured\" at home, the hospital based rates probably underestimate the incidence of chorea in the general paediatric population.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nA higher number of cases were admitted during the colder months, consistent with the reference epidemiological report on chorea at the end of the century. In the 1950s and 1960s the highest frequency of chorea was recorded during the winter months in several Northern and Central European countries. The incidence of rheumatism among Great Ormond Street Hospital inpatients peaked in October, preceding chorea by approximately two months. This is consistent with the current knowledge that most of the rheumatic fever symptoms appear about 10 days after the streptococcal infection, whereas Sydenham's chorea occurs typically 2\u20133 months after infection.\n\nMore than 80% of choreic patients were aged between 7 and 11 years (mean 9.2). Due to a referral bias, this age may be falsely low. Indeed, the British Medical Association (1887) reported the peak age between 11 and 15 years. In the present series, the female:male ratio was 2.7, in accordance with the general choreic population of Britain towards the end of the 1800s. In children below age 7, the female preponderance is less manifest. This was observed also by [[Charles West (physician)|Charles West]] (founder physician of Great Ormond Street Hospital), and subsequently by Osler, who stated that \"the second hemi-decade contains the greatest number of cases in males, and the third the greatest number in females\". In the majority of the 20th century studies, female preponderance is evident only in children over 10 years of age. These observations suggest a role for [[Estrogen|oestrogen]] in Sydenham's chorea expression. Supporting this view, oral [[contraceptives]] and pregnancy can cause relapses of disease.<ref name=\"PBJ\"/>\n\nTen percent of the 1,548 patients whose records were researched for the British study were subsequently admitted with a relapse of chorea.
