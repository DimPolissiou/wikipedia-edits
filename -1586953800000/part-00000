He took part in the defense of Itter Castle against troops of the [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen|17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division]] \"G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen\" with soldiers of the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[United States Army|US Army]] and lost his life in the process.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://riddip.com/the-battle-for-schloss-itter|title=The Battle for Schloss Itter|date=2018-11-09|website=Richard Pendavingh|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref>\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Youth ===\nJosef Gangl was born in 1910 in [[Obertraubling]], Bavaria, the son of a small official of the [[Royal Bavarian State Railways]] and a former shop assistant. When he was a toddler, the family moved to [[Pei\u00dfenberg]] in Upper [[Bavaria]], where Josef's younger siblings were born.\n\n=== Reichswehr ===\nOn November 1, 1928, Gangl joined the [[Reichswehr]], which was then limited to 100,000 men, in order to begin a career as a professional soldier in Artillery Regiment 7 in [[Nuremberg]]. He stayed there until September 1929, in order to serve in Artillery Regiment 5 in [[Ulm]].\n\n=== Wehrmacht ===\nIn 1935 he came to the newly established Artillery Regiment 25 in [[Ludwigsburg]] and married the Ludwigsburg saleswoman Walburga Renz, with whom he later had two children: in 1936, the daughter Sieglinde was born.\n\nIn November 1938, Gangl was promoted to sergeant major. From October 1939 he was an officer school of the [[Wehrmacht]] visit, but he was in the context of preparations for war with his regiment in the Saar-Palatinate on the border with France laid. There, on September 7, 1939, eleven French divisions, 25 km wide, crossed the border and advanced about 8 km into German territory, but withdrew on [[Maurice Gamelin|Gamelin's]] orders within two weeks. This was Gangl's first war effort. In the following months of the \"[[Phoney War]]\" Gangl spent six months in hospitals. On May 14, 1940 he returned to his regiment and took part in the western campaign. There he served as the commander of a reconnaissance unit of the 25th Infantry Division of the [[Wehrmacht]]. After the Armistice of Compi\u00e8gne he was instructor in the artillery replacement department 25 and in August 1940 after a short home leave at its base in Taus in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. On November 25, 1940 he began a one-month training at the artillery school in [[J\u00fcterbog]].\n\nJune 22, 1941 Gangl took the motorized artillery regiment 25 as part of Army Group South in the [[Ukraine]] on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|German-Soviet war]], where he in the battle for Kiev in the 3rd Battalion a battery with 105mm howitzers commanded. On August 20, 1941, Gangl was awarded the Iron Cross II class. In January 1942 he was promoted to first lieutenant and on February 12, 1942 he received the [[Iron Cross|Iron Cross 1st Class]]. On April 24, 1942, Gangl became the commander of a fog launcher- Unit in the 25th Artillery Regiment. He held this position on the Eastern Front until in January 1944 he was assigned as commander of the thrower replacement and training department 7 in H\u00f6chst\u00e4dt an der Donau. In February he went to the army school for battalion and division leaders in [[Antwerp]] for a month. On March 4, 1944, Gangl was sent to the new thrower regiment 83 in Celle, which belonged to thrower brigade 7. With this he marched to France in May 1944. After the [[Invasion of Normandy|Allied invasion of Normandy]], he marched with the throwing brigade to Caen on June 7, 1944, where it was placed under the [[12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend|12th SS Panzer Division]] \"[[Hitler Youth]]\" and played an important role in the defense of the city. The Werferbrigade 7 escaped from the Falaise basin with heavy losses in August. In November it was reorganized in Pr\u00fcm in the Eifel as Volks-Werferbrigade 7 with new equipment. Sepp Gangl participated with the brigade in the [[Battle of the Bulge|Ardennes offensive]], in the subsequent general retreat and in February 1945 in the unsuccessful defense of Saarbr\u00fccken . On March 8, 1945, he was awarded the [[German Cross]] in Goldexcellent. Shortly afterwards he was promoted to major and received command of the 2nd division of Thrower Regiment 83. Thrower Brigade 7 had meanwhile lost half of its men and no longer had any fog throwers. Their commander, General [[Kurt Paape]], ordered the commanders of his battalions near Pei\u00dfenberg to fight their way to Tyrol with them and take part in the defense of the Alpine fortress . In mid-April Gangl met with Lieutenant General [[Georg Ritter von Hengl]], who assigned him and the remnants of his association to the Giehl combat group under Lieutenant Colonel [[Johann Giehl]] in [[W\u00f6rgl]].\n\n=== Resistance in Austria ===\nA few days after his arrival in [[W\u00f6rgl]], Gangl contacted the local group of Austrian resistance under [[Alois Mayr]]. He provided the resistance fighters with information and weapons. It was decided that the execution of [[Johann Giehl]]'s order to defend W\u00f6rgl against the Americans to the end, to break bridges and block paths, should be prevented, and furthermore to free prominent French prisoners from the nearby [[Itter Castle]]. On May 3, 1945, however, parts of the Giehl combat group in Niederaudorf were attacked by the [[12th Armored Division (United States)|12th US Armored Division]] and suffered heavy casualties. Von Hengl had his troops withdrawn from [[W\u00f6rgl]] and [[Itter]], whereupon units of the [[Waffen-SS|Waffen SS]] moving up. In the meantime, many residents of W\u00f6rgl had already hung white flags out of the windows. According to an order from [[Heinrich Himmler]], all male residents of such a house were shot. Gangl, like Mayr, saw it as his obligation to stay in place to protect the residents from reprisals with his soldiers. Together with ten comrades from Thrower Regiment 83, he remained in W\u00f6rgl against Hengls' order to withdraw.\n\nOn May 4, 1945 at 11 a.m., the Czech cook Andreas Krobot appeared at Gangl, coming by bike from [[Itter Castle]], and asked for immediate help for the prisoners there, since an attack by the Waffen SS on the castle was imminent. Gangl, who did not want to sacrifice his men in an Ascension Command and had promised to get them through alive, was forced to run towards the white-flagged Americans and ask for help. In [[Kufstein]], 8 km away, he met an American reconnaissance unit under the command of Captain [[John C. \"Jack\" Lee]]. This ultimately moved with 14 US soldiers and Gangl and ten of his former artillerymen to [[Itter Castle]], where it was the battle for Itter Castle the possibly only warfare of World War II came, in which soldiers of the US Army and the Wehrmacht fought side by side. Gangl called Alois Mayr again for help, whereupon two other [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers and the young resistance fighter [[Hans Waltl]] drove to the castle. The freed French prisoners also took part in the fight. On the morning of May 5, about 100 to 150 men from the [[17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen|17th SS Panzer Grenadier Division]] \"G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen\" attacked. Gangl was fatally hit by a sniper while trying to get former French Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] out of the line of fire. He died as the only defender of the castle. Around 4:00 p.m., a relief unit from the [[142nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|142nd US Infantry Regiment]] reached the castle and defeated the besiegers, capturing about 100 SS men.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Awards ==\n\n* [[Iron Cross]] II Class on August 20, 1941\n* [[Iron Cross]] 1st Class on February 12, 1942\n* [[German Cross|German cross]] in gold on March 8, 1945\n\n== Posthumous honors ==\nGangl was honored as a hero of the Austrian resistance.

Very little of his life before becoming emperor is known, other than that he was a {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) who served under the commanders [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] and his son [[Aspar]] for fifteen years. After the death of Emperor [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]] on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate for the throne by Aspar, who held much influence because of his military power. After a month of negotiations [[Pulcheria]],  Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. [[Flavius Zeno]], a military leader whose influence was similar to Aspar's, may have been involved in these negotiations, as he was given the high-ranking court title of {{lang|la|[[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Late Roman and Byzantine periods|patrician]]}} upon Marcian's accession. Marcian was elected and inaugurated on 25 August 450.\n\nMarcian reversed many of the actions of Theodosius{{nbsp}}II in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]'s relationship with the [[Hunnic Empire|Huns]] under [[Attila]] and in religious matters. Marcian almost immediately revoked all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila was raiding Italy, then a part of the Western Roman Empire, Marcian launched expeditions across the [[Danube]] into the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], defeating the [[Huns]] in their own heartland. This action, accompanied by the famine and plague that broke out in northern Italy, allowed the Western Roman Empire to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian peninsula.\n\nAfter Attila's death in 453, Marcian took advantage of the resulting fragmentation of the Hunnic confederation by settling [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes within Roman lands as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}} (\"federates\" providing military service in exchange for benefits). Marcian also convened the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which declared that [[Jesus]] had two \"[[Nature (philosophy)|natures]]\": divine and human. This led to the alienation of the population of the eastern provinces of [[Byzantine Syria|Syria]] and [[Byzantine Egypt|Egypt]], as many of them were [[miaphysites]], rejecting the new official [[Christology]]. Marcian died on 26 January 457, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire with a treasury surplus of seven million [[solidi]] coins, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon the Eastern Roman Empire by the Huns and Theodosius' tribute payments. After his death, Aspar passed over Marcian's son-in-law, [[Anthemius]], and had a military commander, [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], elected as emperor.\n\n==Early life==\nMarcian was born in {{circa}} 392,{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=153}}{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} in either [[Thracia|Thrace]]{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=104}} or [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyria]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} named Flavius Marcianus.{{sfn|Keppie|2002|p=137}} The ancient historian [[John Malalas]] describes him as being tall and having some sort of foot impediment.{{sfn|Baldwin|1982 |p=98}} Little of Marcian's early life is known. His father had served in the military and at a young age Marcian enlisted at [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] in Thrace. By the time of the [[Roman\u2013Sasanian War (421\u2013422)|Roman\u2013Sassanian War of 421\u2013422]], Marcian had likely reached the military rank of [[Military tribune|tribune]]\u2014the historian [[Theophanes the Confessor]] mentions him commanding a military unit. He did not see action in the war, having become ill in [[Lycia]]. There he was cared for by [[Tatianus (Praefectus urbi)|Tatianus]], who would be made {{lang|la|[[praefectus urbi]]}} (prefect of Constantinople) by Marcian, and Tatianus' brother [[Iulius (praeses)|Iulius]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=714\u2013715}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Marcian eventually rose to become the {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) of [[Aspar]], the {{lang|la|[[magister militum]]}} (commander-in-chief) of the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite being half-[[Alans|Alanic]] and half-[[Goths|Gothic]], Aspar held much influence in the empire.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=45, 75, 84}} In the early 430s, Marcian served under Aspar in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where he was captured by [[Vandals]]. [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], [[Procopius]] and later authors give a likely false account in which Marcian, while in captivity, met the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]], who predicted he would later become emperor. After his capture, Marcian is not mentioned again until the death of the eastern emperor, [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Background==\n===Reign of Theodosius II===\nThe Eastern Roman Empire was plagued by external threats during the reign of Theodosius&nbsp;II. In 429 the Vandals, led by Gaiseric, began to conquer Roman Africa. Theodosius immediately organized a response, sending Aspar and three other commanders to attempt to repel them in the summer of 431. To the north, the [[Huns]], who had customarily attacked the empire whenever its armies were preoccupied, withdrawing as those forces returned, sent ambassadors to Theodosius in 431, demanding tribute. He agreed to their demand to pay {{convert|350|lb}} of gold each year. In 434, the Eastern Roman armies were still campaigning against the Vandals in Africa, having faced initial defeats and the withdrawal of many of the Western Roman soldiers. In the face of Eastern Roman weakness, the Huns doubled their demand, asking for {{convert|700|lb}} of gold per year, which Theodosius agreed to. The threat the Huns posed to his weakly protected empire was enough that Theodosius recalled a large number of his forces from Africa. With large numbers of the Eastern Roman armies home, and [[Attila]], who had just taken power in the Hunnic Confederation, busy campaigning to the north, Theodosius refused to pay the tribute and continued to refuse to until 439.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} \n\nOn 19 October 439, the Vandals defeated the weakened Eastern Roman armies and captured the major city of [[Carthage]]. Both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires began preparing a massive counter-offensive, stripping the Balkan provinces of protection. In the spring of 440, 1,100 ships set sail from Constantinople for Africa;{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} sending away such a large number of the Eastern Roman forces was a huge gamble on Theodosius' part. He was betting the fortified cities along the [[Danube]] could delay the Huns long enough for the invasion force to gain a secure foothold in Africa, allowing troops to be withdrawn back to the northern frontier. This gamble worked until 442 when the bishop of [[Margus (city)|Margus]] led a raiding party into the Huns' territory and desecrated their royal tombs. In response to this desecration, Attila demanded that the bishop be handed over. To ensure his own safety, the bishop struck a deal with Attila, surrendering the city of Margus to him in exchange for his own life. With control of Margus, Attila had a foothold across the Danube, which he aggressively exploited, capturing and destroying the cities of [[Viminacium]], [[Singidunum]], and [[Sirmium]]. Theodosius recalled Aspar to Constantinople and launched a counterattack. After his force was decisively defeated, Theodosius undertook to pay tribute to the Huns every year, which he did until his death in 450.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201378}}\n\n===Rise to the throne===\nAfter Theodosius&nbsp;II died unexpectedly in a riding accident on 28 July 450, the Eastern Roman Empire faced its first [[succession crisis]] in 60 years. Theodosius had no sons, nor had he designated a successor.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=94}} Some later sources state that he willed the throne to Marcian on his deathbed, but this is thought to be propaganda created by Marcian's supporters after his election.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian had served Aspar and his father [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] loyally for fifteen years. Aspar conspired to have Marcian elected and was able to negotiate with other powerful figures to have him made the emperor, despite his relative obscurity.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} There was a one-month interregnum where negotiations for the succession took place, one of which was with Pulcheria, Theodosius&nbsp;II's sister, who agreed to marry Marcian;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} it is thought that Pulcheria agreed to marry Marcian on the condition that he would abandon Theodosius II{{'}}s religious policies and convoke a Church council.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=104}} Their marriage helped to legitimize Marcian's rule, as Pulcheria's family, the [[Theodosian dynasty]], had direct ties to the throne.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Despite being married to Marcian, Pulcheria kept the vow of [[virginity]] she had made in 413, at age 14, during her three years of marriage to him.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=537}}{{sfn|Holum|1989|p=209}} \n\nHistorian [[Doug Lee (historian)|Doug Lee]] proposes that negotiations were also needed between Aspar and [[Flavius Zeno]], who was in a similar position of military power. Zeno was given the prestigious rank of [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] upon Marcian's ascension in 450, suggesting a deal whereby Zeno was rewarded for supporting Marcian instead of claiming the throne for himself;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Zeno would ultimately die within a year of Marcian{{'}}s accession.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}} Aspar{{'s}} son, [[Ardabur (consul 447)|Ardabur]], was promoted to command the army of the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Perfecture of the East]] as the new {{lang|la|[[magister militum per Orientem]]}}, soon after Marcian's accession.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}}\n\nMarcian was elected on 25 August 450, with Pulcheria herself crowning him emperor, a unique event symbolizing that the imperial power was shared, and likely to boost Marcian's legitimacy further.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian took the regnal name of Imperator Caesar Flavius Marcianus Augustus upon his coronation.{{sfn|Babcock|2005|p=157}} The election of Marcian in 450 resulted in large changes to eastern imperial policy. [[Chrysaphius]], the [[eunuch]] and {{lang|la|[[spatharios]]}} (guard of the imperial chambers), who had exercised much influence over Theodosius, was either murdered or executed. Both Pulcheria and Zeno were opposed to Chrysaphius' influence, which may have motivated Marcian's actions. Marcian took a tougher stance against the Huns and a more direct role in ecclesiastical affairs. [[Byzantine studies|Byzantist]] [[Constance Head]] considers Marcian to be an \"an independent-minded emperor.\"{{sfn|Head|1982|p=20}} Lee states that Marcian \"can appear as a stronger figure than many other fifth-century incumbents of the imperial office\", but notes that \"Flavius Zeno and Pulcheria had both been opponents of Chrysaphius, so the changes may be more a reflection of their influence.\"{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n==Reign==\n===Conflict with the Huns===\n[[File:450 roman-hunnic-empire 1764x1116.jpg|right|Alt=A map of Europe showing the territories of the Hunnic confederation and the Roman Empire | A map of Europe in 450 AD, showing the Hunnic confederation under Attila in orange, and the Roman Empire in yellow|thumb|upright=2|alt=A colored drawing of Europe in 450 AD, showing the borders of states at the time of Attila by different colors, with the Roman Empire in yellow, the Hunnic Confederation in orange, the Vandal Kingdom in blue, the Franks in green, the Goths in pink, the Sueves in purple, the Saxons in light pink, the Burgundians in brown, the Lombards in bright yellow, and the Alans in light blue.]]\nAlmost immediately after becoming emperor, Marcian revoked Theodosius' treaties with Attila and proclaimed the end of subsidies. He stated that he might grant gifts if Attila was friendly, but Attila would be repelled if he attempted to raid the Eastern Roman Empire. At this time Attila was preparing to invade the Western Roman Empire, under the guise of helping Emperor [[Valentinian&nbsp;III]] against the [[Visigoths]]. Attila reacted angrily to Marcian's proposal, demanding tribute, but did not alter his invasion plans. He led his horde from [[Pannonia]] in spring 451 into the Western Roman Empire.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}} [[Flavius Aetius]], who was the the supreme commander of the Western Roman army as {{lang|la|[[Comes et Magister Utriusque Militiae]]}}, organized a defense and called upon the Visigoths, [[Franks]], [[Burgundians]], Alans, Saxons, Celtic [[Armorica]]ns, and other tribal groups numbering about 60,000 to aid him. Attila's forces were made up of [[Gepids]], Alans, [[Scirii]], [[Heruli (military unit)|Heruli]], [[Rugii|Rugians]], along with a number of Franks, Burgundians, and [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=85}}\n\nAttila sacked [[Metz]] and attempted a siege of [[Orleans]], before meeting Aetius' forces at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], in northeast [[Gaul]]. This battle involved around 100,000 men and resulted in very large losses on both sides. After the battle, Attila retreated to the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], and Aetius dismissed his coalition of tribes, sending them back to their own territories. In spring 452, Attila again launched a raid, into Italy, which was almost entirely undefended. He was likely motivated by a desire for revenge, along with a need to raid to stabilize his tribal state, which was dependent upon raiding for loot and resources. Attila captured the city of [[Aquileia]] after a long and difficult siege,{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=86}} and [[looted|sacked]] it. He then raided across northern Italy, taking [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]) and other important cities. There was much fear that Attila would attack [[Rome]] itself, the walls of which were weaker than those of some cities he had already captured. During this period, other than cutting his [[lines of communication]] and harassing his rear forces, Aetius did not launch a direct attack on Attila.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}\n\nDespite the plunder he now had from capturing Aquileia, Milan, and other cities, Attila was quickly placed in a precarious situation, because of the actions of both Eastern and Western Rome. In Italy, he was seriously lacking in funds, having not received subsidies from either Eastern or Western Rome for two years. Constant warfare had depleted his forces. In addition, Attila's homeland was threatened by the Eastern Empire which, despite the punitive raids he ordered, took the offensive against the Great Hungarian Plain in mid-452, attacking across the Danube and inflicting a defeat upon the Huns.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}} The area attacked by the Eastern Romans was home to Ostrogoths and Gepids, two groups bitterly opposed to Hunnic rule, and was the [[breadbasket]] of the Hunnic Empire. The loss of food supply from Attila's own land coupled with a famine that Italy was suffering at the time, along with a plague that followed it, placed yet more strain upon Attila, allowing the Western Roman Empire to bribe him into retreating to his homeland. After returning to the Great Hungarian Plain, he threatened to invade the Eastern Empire the following spring and conquer it entirely.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=70}} Marcian and Aspar ignored his threats. They reasoned, based upon the previous treaties that Attila had broken, that he could not be permanently deterred even by tons of gold. The pair believed the gold would be better spent building up armies, not appeasing threats. Also, the rich Asian and African provinces, which were protected behind Constantinople, were secure enough to allow the Eastern Empire to retake any European provinces it might lose. This campaign never came to fruition, as Attila died unexpectedly in 453, either from [[hemorrhaging]] or alcoholic [[suffocation]], after celebrating a marriage to one of his many wives. After his death, his tribal confederation rapidly fell apart, starting first with rebellions of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=88}}\n\nThis fragmentation allowed the Eastern Empire to resume its policy of playing off barbarians against each other, to stop any one tribe from becoming too powerful. It is almost certain that the Gepid king [[Ardaric]] came to an agreement with Marcian. Ardaric had formed a coalition of the Rugians, Sciri, Heruli, and his own Gepids, which he led against the remaining Hunnic confederation. Ardaric, alongside the Ostrogoth leaders [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], [[Valamir]] and [[Videmir]], decisively defeated Attila's oldest son, [[Ellac]], at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 455, where he was slain. After this battle, the Hunnic confederation fell apart entirely. In the wake of the collapse of the Hunnic Empire, Marcian accepted the Ostrogoths, who had established themselves in [[Pannonia Prima]] and [[Pannonia Valeria|Valeria]]\u2014nominally two Western Roman provinces\u2014as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}}.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}}{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=172}} This marked the continuation of the tacit abandonment of a [[Danube\u2013Iller\u2013Rhine Limes|rigid Danube barrier]], which had previously been manned by Roman {{lang|la|[[laeti]]}}, barbarians settled directly in Roman land in exchange for military service. For some time before Marcian, the {{lang|la|laeti}} had been replaced by {{lang|la|foederati}}, although the distinction between the two was increasingly breaking down. Marcian's successors would grant the status of {{lang|la|foederati}} to multiple peoples and ceding them lands in the recovered European provinces: the Rugians in eastern Thrace, Sciri in [[Lower Moesia]] and [[Scythia]], Gepids in [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]]. This network of subject peoples, who were generally reliable and manageable, was beneficial to the Eastern Empire. The various tribal peoples generally kept each other's power in check without Roman intervention. They could also be induced to serve the empire against its enemies by way of gifts, subsidies, and treaties.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}} After the death of Attila, Marcian enjoyed a relatively peaceful reign, although he won some small campaigns against the [[Saracens]] in [[Roman Syria|Syria]] and against the [[Blemmyes]] in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}\n\n===Religious policy===\n[[File:Fourth ecumenical council of chalcedon - 1876.jpg|thumb|''Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon'', 1876&nbsp;painting by [[Vasily Surikov]]|alt=A wall painting of the Council of Chalcedon showing Marcian and Pulcheria seated on thrones.]]\nShortly before Marcian became emperor, the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] was held in 449. The council stated that Jesus had one divine united nature, called {{lang|la|[[miaphysitism|miaphysis]]}}; this was rejected by the [[Pope]] and the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] due to disputes on the matter of [[Christology]], as the Pope and Patriarch of Constantinople saw the belief in miaphysis as [[heretical]].{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=99 & 105}}{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=81}}\n\nTo repudiate the Second Council of Ephesus, Marcian convened a new council of the imperial church, deemed to pass [[ecumenical council|universally respected canons]], in 451. Pulcheria may have influenced this decision or even made the convention of a council a requirement during her negotiations with Aspar to marry Marcian. The council was to take place near Constantinople so that the government could watch the proceedings closely. Initially, it was to be held at the city of [[Nicaea]], which held enormous religious importance to the early church, as it was the site of its first council, the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. However, Marcian successfully requested the transfer of the location to [[Chalcedon]]. This was closer to Constantinople and would allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube frontier. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] met in October 451. About 500 [[bishops]] attended it, most of them Eastern Roman, although two African bishops and two Papal legates sent by [[Pope Leo&nbsp;I]] attended.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=585}}{{sfn|Whitworth|2017|p=360}} This council condemned the Second Council of Ephesus and agreed that Jesus had a divine nature ({{lang|la|[[physis]]}}) and a human nature, united in one person ({{lang|la|[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]}}), \"without confusion, change, division, or separation.\"{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=146}}\n\nThe council also agreed to condemn the Coptic [[Pope Dioscorus&nbsp;I of Alexandria]], who had overseen the Second Council of Ephesus, and revoke the condemnations of [[Ibas of Edessa]] and [[Theodoret]], which had taken place during this Council. The council also repeated the importance of the [[See of Constantinople]], placing it firmly in second place behind the See of Rome, and giving it the right to appoint bishops in the Eastern Roman Empire, over the objection of Pope Leo I;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} the Patriarchs of Alexandria also objected to the elevation of the See of Constantinople.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=122}} The council ended in November 451, after which Marcian issued numerous [[edicts]] confirming the outcomes of the council;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} showing that the outcome of the council was not universally accepted.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=148}} One such edict ordered the repression of [[Eutychianism|Eutychianists]], who did not believe in the hypostatic union of Jesus' two natures, barring them from holding state offices, forbidding them from criticizing the Council of Chalcedon, and ordering their literature, along with that of the [[Nestorians]], to be burned.{{sfn|Bury|2012|p=380}} \n\nThe anti-Miaphysite resolutions of the council led to a large increase in civil disruption in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt, where the majority of the population was Miaphysitic. Several violent revolts were put down with military force after significant bloodshed, in Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch;{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=105}} as well as sending the military to suppress monks in [[Palaestina Prima|Palestine]]<!--Please note that this was the proper Roman name for the province and has no relation to the modern Israel\u2013Palestine debates.--> and placing troops in [[Alexandria]] to ensure the installation of [[Proterius of Alexandria]], who was to replace the deposed [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Pope Dioscorus I]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} According to the Byzantist [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]], even after these revolts were put down, the popular dissatisfaction with the state church among the Miaphysite and Nestorian population remained, as the eastern provinces became increasingly convinced of their need for independence from the Eastern Roman Empire. Vasiliev states that this would lead to long-lasting disloyalty toward the Eastern Roman government among the eastern provinces, ultimately facilitating the loss of these provinces to the Sassanians and later to the [[Arabs]].{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=105\u2013106}} As an additional result of the council and the following edicts, many Christians who disagreed with the council, including many Nestorians, migrated to the [[Sassanian Empire]].{{sfn|Bauer|2010|pp=122\u2013123}} The separation of the Miaphysites from the churches accepting Chalcedonian doctrine would be made final after the failed attempts of reconciliation under Emperor [[Justinian I]] ({{Reign|527|565}}), with the Miaphysites splitting the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] from the main body of Christians.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=194\u2013202}}\n\nMarcian also funded Pulcheria's extensive building projects until her death in July 453.

He repealed the {{lang|la|[[Follis (tax)|follis]]}}, a tax on senators' property that amounted to seven pounds of gold per annum.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian removed the financial responsibilities of the [[Roman consul|consuls]] and praetors, held since the time of the [[Roman Republic]], to fund public sports and games or give wealth to the citizens of Constantinople, respectively. In addition, he made it so that only a {{lang|la|[[vir illustris]]}} (a high-ranking man) could hold either office.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} He also partially repealed a marriage law enacted by [[Constantine I]], which decreed that a man of senatorial status could not marry a slave, [[freedwoman]], actress, or woman of no social status ({{lang|la|[[Honestiores and humiliores|humilis]]}}), which had been created in an attempt to preserve the purity of the senatorial class. Marcian adjusted this law by declaring that the law should not exclude a woman of good character, regardless of her social status or wealth.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} By the time of his death, Marcian's shrewd cutting of expenditures and his avoidance of large-scale wars left the Eastern Roman treasury with a surplus of {{convert|100,000|lb}} of gold.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} \n\nIn 451, Marcian decreed that anyone who performed [[Paganism|pagan rites]] would lose their property and be condemned to death and that no pagan temples, which had previously been closed, could be reopened. To ensure this law was implemented, he set a penalty of {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of gold for any judge, governor or official who did not enforce the law.{{sfn|Evans|2002|p=66}}\n\n===Politics===\nWhen Marcian became emperor, he was influenced by Flavius Zeno, Pulcheria, and Aspar. Flavius Zeno died soon after Marcian ascended the throne, possibly as early as the end of 451,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=97}} and Pulcheria died in July 453, leaving Aspar as the only major influence in the court of the Eastern Roman Empire.

The two teams had become more like political parties than sports teams by his time, wielding large influence in the empire; both vied for power. After the Greens responded angrily to his patronage, Marcus censured them, forbidding any of them to hold any public office for three years.

When the Vandals attacked the Western Roman Empire and [[Sack of Rome (455)|sacked Rome]] in 455, after [[Petronius Maximus]] assassinated Valentinian&nbsp;III and broke an [[engagement]] treaty with the Vandals, Marcian did not respond violently, possibly due to the influence of Aspar.

According to this account, the Vandal King Gaiseric recognized that Marcian would later be emperor. In exchange for being released, he made Marcia pledge not to attack the Vandals should he become emperor.{{efn|name=A|Propaganda involving the story of an eagle blocking the sun, and another figure recognizing they would be emperor, was used by both Byzantine emperors [[Philippikos Bardanes]] and [[Basil&nbsp;I]].{{sfn|Lilie|2014|p=193}}}} This account originates from [[Priscus]], who served as an advisor to Euphemius, the {{lang|la|magister officiorum}}.

The East Roman historian [[Theodorus Lector]] speaks of Marcian's sudden reversal of policy, and [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], a Roman historian writing a century after the event, states that the Vandals released Licinia Eudoxia, Placidia, and Eudocia to Marcian after he threatened them with war,{{sfn|Clover|1978|p=194}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=243}} in either late 556 or early 557.{{sfn|Clover|1978|p=194}}\n\nMarcian did not recognize any Western Emperor after Valentinian, denying Petronius Maximus, now Western Emperor, when he sent an embassy requesting it, and similarly refusing to recognize [[Avitus]], who succeeded Maximus.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=704}} Marcian's exact treatment of Avitus is debated. The Roman historian [[Hydatius]] states that in 455 Avitus sent \"[ambassadors] to Marcian for the sake of unanimity of power,\" and that, \"Marcian and Avitus make use of Roman power in concord\". The exact usage of concord ({{lang|la|concordia}} in the original Latin) has led to debate among scholars. Some such as [[Thomas Hodgkin (historian)|Thomas Hodgkin]], [[J. B. Bury]], and [[William Bayless]] consider it grounds for the belief that Marcian may have recognized Avitus. Most scholars take a more conservative stance on it; [[Ernst Stein]] suggests that it is merely a reflection of West Roman propaganda, whereas [[Norman Baynes]] believes it indicates that Marcian was cordial to Avitus, neither hostile nor friendly.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}{{sfn|Baynes|1922|p=223}} [[C. E. Stevens]] interprets the phrase as meaning only that the meeting of the diplomats was amicable, rather than reflecting a relationship between the two states.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}\n\nThe historian [[Geoffrey Nathan]] suggests the fact that only two Western delegates attended the Council of Chalcedon points to a new level of Western Roman self-absorption in their own political and religious affairs. He mentions that the canon from this council delegating authority over the whole east to the See of Constantinople marks a religious separation. Authority over the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire would prove a point of contention between Rome and Constantinople, leading up to the [[East\u2013West Schism]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Death==\nMarcian's reign ended on 26 January 457, when he died, possibly of [[gangrene]]{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}}\u2014according to some legends during a long religious procession from the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Grand Palace]] to the [[Hebdomon]], where he made the journey on foot, despite the fact that he could barely walk due to severe foot [[inflammation]], possibly [[gout]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}}{{sfn|Kelly|2013|p=240}} He was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], in Constantinople, next to his wife Pulcheria,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} in a [[Porphyry (geology)#Imperial sarcophagi|porphyry sarcophagus]] that was described in the 10th century by [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] in the {{lang|la|[[De Ceremoniis]]}}.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1948|pp=p1 & 3\u201326}} He left the Eastern Empire with seven million [[solidi]] in its treasury, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon Eastern Rome by the Huns, both through warfare and the massive subsidies they received under Theodosius.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=127}} \n\nAlthough Marcian had a son-in-law, Anthemius, he did not have any connection to the Theodosians, which Marcian himself had gained through his marriage to Pulcheria, and thus would not be considered a legitimate dynastic heir, so Aspar was once again left to play the role of emperor-maker. He selected [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], a fifty-year-old officer commanding a unit in the [[praesental]] army. A later source claims that the [[Eastern Roman Senate]] offered to elect Aspar himself, but he declined, with the cryptic comment: \"I fear that a tradition in ruling might be initiated through me\". This comment has often been interpreted to be a reference to the fact that he was an [[Arian]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} or else to his Alanic heritage.{{sfn|Norwich|1998|p=51}}\n\nAnthemius would later be sent by Leo to become the [[Western Roman]] [[Roman Emperor|emperor]];{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1998}} Leo nominated him to be Western Emperor in the spring of 467, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Emperor [[Libius Severus]] since 465. Leo sent Anthemius to Rome with an army, headed by [[Marcellinus (magister militum)|Marcellinus]], the {{lang|la|magister militum}} of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]; upon nearing Rome, Anthemius was installed as emperor on 12 April 467.{{sfn|Mathisen|1998}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20111224 Flavius Marcianus Augustus Column Fatih Istanbul Turkey.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Color photograph of an ancient stone column set in front of a modern building and parked cars.

Some later scholars attribute his success not just to his skill, but also to a large degree of luck: not only had he been fortunate enough to have Pulcheria to legitimize his rule, for much of it the two greatest external threats to Rome, the Sassanian Empire and the Huns, were absorbed with their own internal problems; additionally, no natural disasters or plagues occurred during his reign.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=306}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1297}} He was remembered fondly by the people of Constantinople, who would shout \"Reign like Marcian!\" at the installation of future emperors.{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=307}}\n\n===Buildings===\nThe {{lang|la|praefectus urbi}} (urban prefect) [[Tatianus]] built a [[Column of Marcian|column]] dedicated to Marcian, sometime between 450 and 452.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=1053\u20131054}}{{sfn|D'Ayala |Fodde |2008|p=1167}} It still stands in Istanbul, near the north branch of the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]],{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=204}} though the statue of Marcian that originally topped it has been lost.{{sfn|Freely|\u00c7akmak|2004|p=63}} Marcian also had a statue in the [[Forum of Arcadius]], which contained the statues of several of the successors of Emperor [[Arcadius]].{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991a|p=1347}} Marcian may have been the sponsor of the [[Chrysotriklinos]] of the Great Palace of Constantinople. The {{lang|la|[[Patria of Constantinople]]}} states that Marcian constructed it, whereas the 10th century encyclopedia {{lang|la|[[Suda]]}} states that Emperor [[Justin&nbsp;II]] built it, a view with which most historians agree.

Very little of his life before becoming emperor is known, other than that he was a {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) who served under the commanders [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] and his son [[Aspar]] for fifteen years. After the death of Emperor [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]] on 28 July 450, Marcian was made a candidate for the throne by Aspar, who held much influence because of his military power. After a month of negotiations [[Pulcheria]],  Theodosius' sister, agreed to marry Marcian. [[Flavius Zeno]], a military leader whose influence was similar to Aspar's, may have been involved in these negotiations, as he was given the high-ranking court title of {{lang|la|[[Patrician (ancient Rome)#Late Roman and Byzantine periods|patrician]]}} upon Marcian's accession. Marcian was elected and inaugurated on 25 August 450.\n\nMarcian reversed many of the actions of Theodosius{{nbsp}}II in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]'s relationship with the [[Hunnic Empire|Huns]] under [[Attila]] and in religious matters. Marcian almost immediately revoked all treaties with Attila, ending all subsidy payments to him. In 452, while Attila was raiding Italy, then a part of the Western Roman Empire, Marcian launched expeditions across the [[Danube]] into the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], defeating the [[Huns]] in their own heartland. This action, accompanied by the famine and plague that broke out in northern Italy, allowed the Western Roman Empire to bribe Attila into retreating from the Italian peninsula.\n\nAfter Attila's death in 453, Marcian took advantage of the resulting fragmentation of the Hunnic confederation by settling [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribes within Roman lands as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}} (\"federates\" providing military service in exchange for benefits). Marcian also convened the [[Council of Chalcedon]], which declared that [[Jesus]] had two \"[[Nature (philosophy)|natures]]\": divine and human. This led to the alienation of the population of the eastern provinces of [[Byzantine Syria|Syria]] and [[Byzantine Egypt|Egypt]], as many of them were [[miaphysites]], rejecting the new official [[Christology]]. Marcian died on 26 January 457, leaving the Eastern Roman Empire with a treasury surplus of seven million [[solidi]] coins, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon the Eastern Roman Empire by the Huns and Theodosius' tribute payments. After his death, Aspar passed over Marcian's son-in-law, [[Anthemius]], and had a military commander, [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], elected as emperor.\n\n==Early life==\nMarcian was born in {{circa}} 392,{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=153}}{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} in either [[Thracia|Thrace]]{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=104}} or [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum|Illyria]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} named Flavius Marcianus.{{sfn|Keppie|2002|p=137}} The ancient historian [[John Malalas]] describes him as being tall and having some sort of foot impediment.{{sfn|Baldwin|1982 |p=98}} Little of Marcian's early life is known. His father had served in the military and at a young age Marcian enlisted at [[Philippopolis (Thracia)|Philippopolis]] in Thrace. By the time of the [[Roman\u2013Sasanian War (421\u2013422)|Roman\u2013Sassanian War of 421\u2013422]], Marcian had likely reached the military rank of [[Military tribune|tribune]]\u2014the historian [[Theophanes the Confessor]] mentions him commanding a military unit. He did not see action in the war, having become ill in [[Lycia]]. There he was cared for by [[Tatianus (Praefectus urbi)|Tatianus]], who would be made {{lang|la|[[praefectus urbi]]}} (prefect of Constantinople) by Marcian, and Tatianus' brother [[Iulius (praeses)|Iulius]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=714\u2013715}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Marcian eventually rose to become the {{lang|la|[[Domesticus (Roman Empire)|domesticus]]}} (personal assistant) of [[Aspar]], the {{lang|la|[[magister militum]]}} (commander-in-chief) of the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite being half-[[Alans|Alanic]] and half-[[Goths|Gothic]], Aspar held much influence in the empire.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=45, 75, 84}} In the early 430s, Marcian served under Aspar in [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman Africa]], where he was captured by [[Vandals]]. [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], [[Procopius]] and later authors give a likely false account in which Marcian, while in captivity, met the Vandal king [[Gaiseric]], who predicted he would later become emperor. After his capture, Marcian is not mentioned again until the death of the eastern emperor, [[Theodosius&nbsp;II]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Background==\n===Reign of Theodosius II===\nThe Eastern Roman Empire was plagued by external threats during the reign of Theodosius&nbsp;II. In 429 the Vandals, led by Gaiseric, began to conquer Roman Africa. Theodosius immediately organized a response, sending Aspar and three other commanders to attempt to repel them in the summer of 431. To the north, the [[Huns]], who had customarily attacked the empire whenever its armies were preoccupied, withdrawing as those forces returned, sent ambassadors to Theodosius in 431, demanding tribute. He agreed to their demand to pay {{convert|350|lb}} of gold each year. In 434, the Eastern Roman armies were still campaigning against the Vandals in Africa, having faced initial defeats and the withdrawal of many of the Western Roman soldiers. In the face of Eastern Roman weakness, the Huns doubled their demand, asking for {{convert|700|lb}} of gold per year, which Theodosius agreed to. The threat the Huns posed to his weakly protected empire was enough that Theodosius recalled a large number of his forces from Africa. With large numbers of the Eastern Roman armies home, and [[Attila]], who had just taken power in the Hunnic Confederation, busy campaigning to the north, Theodosius refused to pay the tribute and continued to refuse to until 439.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} \n\nOn 19 October 439, the Vandals defeated the weakened Eastern Roman armies and captured the major city of [[Carthage]]. Both the Western and Eastern Roman Empires began preparing a massive counter-offensive, stripping the Balkan provinces of protection. In the spring of 440, 1,100 ships set sail from Constantinople for Africa;{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201365}} sending away such a large number of the Eastern Roman forces was a huge gamble on Theodosius' part. He was betting the fortified cities along the [[Danube]] could delay the Huns long enough for the invasion force to gain a secure foothold in Africa, allowing troops to be withdrawn back to the northern frontier. This gamble worked until 442 when the bishop of [[Margus (city)|Margus]] led a raiding party into the Huns' territory and desecrated their royal tombs. In response to this desecration, Attila demanded that the bishop be handed over. To ensure his own safety, the bishop struck a deal with Attila, surrendering the city of Margus to him in exchange for his own life. With control of Margus, Attila had a foothold across the Danube, which he aggressively exploited, capturing and destroying the cities of [[Viminacium]], [[Singidunum]], and [[Sirmium]]. Theodosius recalled Aspar to Constantinople and launched a counterattack. After his force was decisively defeated, Theodosius undertook to pay tribute to the Huns every year, which he did until his death in 450.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|pp=60\u201378}}\n\n===Rise to the throne===\nAfter Theodosius&nbsp;II died unexpectedly in a riding accident on 28 July 450, the Eastern Roman Empire faced its first [[succession crisis]] in 60 years. Theodosius had no sons, nor had he designated a successor.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=94}} Some later sources state that he willed the throne to Marcian on his deathbed, but this is thought to be propaganda created by Marcian's supporters after his election.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian had served Aspar and his father [[Ardabur (consul 427)|Ardabur]] loyally for fifteen years. Aspar conspired to have Marcian elected and was able to negotiate with other powerful figures to have him made the emperor, despite his relative obscurity.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} There was a one-month interregnum where negotiations for the succession took place, one of which was with Pulcheria, Theodosius&nbsp;II's sister, who agreed to marry Marcian;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} it is thought that Pulcheria agreed to marry Marcian on the condition that he would abandon Theodosius II{{'}}s religious policies and convoke a Church council.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=104}} Their marriage helped to legitimize Marcian's rule, as Pulcheria's family, the [[Theodosian dynasty]], had direct ties to the throne.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Despite being married to Marcian, Pulcheria kept the vow of [[virginity]] she had made in 413, at age 14, during her three years of marriage to him.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Smith|2008|p=537}}{{sfn|Holum|1989|p=209}} \n\nHistorian [[Doug Lee (historian)|Doug Lee]] proposes that negotiations were also needed between Aspar and [[Flavius Zeno]], who was in a similar position of military power. Zeno was given the prestigious rank of [[patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] upon Marcian's ascension in 450, suggesting a deal whereby Zeno was rewarded for supporting Marcian instead of claiming the throne for himself;{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=96}} Zeno would ultimately die within a year of Marcian{{'}}s accession.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}} Aspar{{'s}} son, [[Ardabur (consul 447)|Ardabur]], was promoted to command the army of the [[Praetorian prefecture of the East|Perfecture of the East]] as the new {{lang|la|[[magister militum per Orientem]]}}, soon after Marcian's accession.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}}\n\nMarcian was elected on 25 August 450, with Pulcheria herself crowning him emperor, a unique event symbolizing that the imperial power was shared, and likely to boost Marcian's legitimacy further.{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian took the regnal name of Imperator Caesar Flavius Marcianus Augustus upon his coronation.{{sfn|Babcock|2005|p=157}} The election of Marcian in 450 resulted in large changes to eastern imperial policy. [[Chrysaphius]], the [[eunuch]] and {{lang|la|[[spatharios]]}} (guard of the imperial chambers), who had exercised much influence over Theodosius, was either murdered or executed. Both Pulcheria and Zeno were opposed to Chrysaphius' influence, which may have motivated Marcian's actions. Marcian took a tougher stance against the Huns and a more direct role in ecclesiastical affairs. [[Byzantine studies|Byzantist]] [[Constance Head]] considers Marcian to be an \"an independent-minded emperor.\"{{sfn|Head|1982|p=20}} Lee states that Marcian \"can appear as a stronger figure than many other fifth-century incumbents of the imperial office\", but notes that \"Flavius Zeno and Pulcheria had both been opponents of Chrysaphius, so the changes may be more a reflection of their influence.\"{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|pp=97\u201398}}\n\n==Reign==\n===Conflict with the Huns===\n[[File:450 roman-hunnic-empire 1764x1116.jpg|right|Alt=A map of Europe showing the territories of the Hunnic confederation and the Roman Empire | A map of Europe in 450 AD, showing the Hunnic confederation under Attila in orange, and the Roman Empire in yellow|thumb|upright=2|alt=A colored drawing of Europe in 450 AD, showing the borders of states at the time of Attila by different colors, with the Roman Empire in yellow, the Hunnic Confederation in orange, the Vandal Kingdom in blue, the Franks in green, the Goths in pink, the Sueves in purple, the Saxons in light pink, the Burgundians in brown, the Lombards in bright yellow, and the Alans in light blue.]]\nAlmost immediately after becoming emperor, Marcian revoked Theodosius' treaties with Attila and proclaimed the end of subsidies. He stated that he might grant gifts if Attila was friendly, but Attila would be repelled if he attempted to raid the Eastern Roman Empire. At this time Attila was preparing to invade the Western Roman Empire, under the guise of helping Emperor [[Valentinian&nbsp;III]] against the [[Visigoths]]. Attila reacted angrily to Marcian's proposal, demanding tribute, but did not alter his invasion plans. He led his horde from [[Pannonia]] in spring 451 into the Western Roman Empire.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=84}} [[Flavius Aetius]], who was the the supreme commander of the Western Roman army as {{lang|la|[[Comes et Magister Utriusque Militiae]]}}, organized a defense and called upon the Visigoths, [[Franks]], [[Burgundians]], Alans, Saxons, Celtic [[Armorica]]ns, and other tribal groups numbering about 60,000 to aid him. Attila's forces were made up of [[Gepids]], Alans, [[Scirii]], [[Heruli (military unit)|Heruli]], [[Rugii|Rugians]], along with a number of Franks, Burgundians, and [[Ostrogoths]].{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=85}}\n\nAttila sacked [[Metz]] and attempted a siege of [[Orleans]], before meeting Aetius' forces at the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], in northeast [[Gaul]]. This battle involved around 100,000 men and resulted in very large losses on both sides. After the battle, Attila retreated to the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], and Aetius dismissed his coalition of tribes, sending them back to their own territories. In spring 452, Attila again launched a raid, into Italy, which was almost entirely undefended. He was likely motivated by a desire for revenge, along with a need to raid to stabilize his tribal state, which was dependent upon raiding for loot and resources. Attila captured the city of [[Aquileia]] after a long and difficult siege,{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=86}} and [[looted|sacked]] it. He then raided across northern Italy, taking [[Mediolanum]] ([[Milan]]) and other important cities. There was much fear that Attila would attack [[Rome]] itself, the walls of which were weaker than those of some cities he had already captured. During this period, other than cutting his [[lines of communication]] and harassing his rear forces, Aetius did not launch a direct attack on Attila.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}\n\nDespite the plunder he now had from capturing Aquileia, Milan, and other cities, Attila was quickly placed in a precarious situation, because of the actions of both Eastern and Western Rome. In Italy, he was seriously lacking in funds, having not received subsidies from either Eastern or Western Rome for two years. Constant warfare had depleted his forces. In addition, Attila's homeland was threatened by the Eastern Empire which, despite the punitive raids he ordered, took the offensive against the Great Hungarian Plain in mid-452, attacking across the Danube and inflicting a defeat upon the Huns.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}} The area attacked by the Eastern Romans was home to Ostrogoths and Gepids, two groups bitterly opposed to Hunnic rule, and was the [[breadbasket]] of the Hunnic Empire. The loss of food supply from Attila's own land coupled with a famine that Italy was suffering at the time, along with a plague that followed it, placed yet more strain upon Attila, allowing the Western Roman Empire to bribe him into retreating to his homeland. After returning to the Great Hungarian Plain, he threatened to invade the Eastern Empire the following spring and conquer it entirely.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=87}}{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=70}} Marcian and Aspar ignored his threats. They reasoned, based upon the previous treaties that Attila had broken, that he could not be permanently deterred even by tons of gold. The pair believed the gold would be better spent building up armies, not appeasing threats. Also, the rich Asian and African provinces, which were protected behind Constantinople, were secure enough to allow the Eastern Empire to retake any European provinces it might lose. This campaign never came to fruition, as Attila died unexpectedly in 453, either from [[hemorrhaging]] or alcoholic [[suffocation]], after celebrating a marriage to one of his many wives. After his death, his tribal confederation rapidly fell apart, starting first with rebellions of the Ostrogoths.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=88}}\n\nThis fragmentation allowed the Eastern Empire to resume its policy of playing off barbarians against each other, to stop any one tribe from becoming too powerful. It is almost certain that the Gepid king [[Ardaric]] came to an agreement with Marcian. Ardaric had formed a coalition of the Rugians, Sciri, Heruli, and his own Gepids, which he led against the remaining Hunnic confederation. Ardaric, alongside the Ostrogoth leaders [[Theodemir (Ostrogothic king)|Theodemir]], [[Valamir]] and [[Videmir]], decisively defeated Attila's oldest son, [[Ellac]], at the [[Battle of Nedao]] in 455, where he was slain. After this battle, the Hunnic confederation fell apart entirely. In the wake of the collapse of the Hunnic Empire, Marcian accepted the Ostrogoths, who had established themselves in [[Pannonia Prima]] and [[Pannonia Valeria|Valeria]]\u2014nominally two Western Roman provinces\u2014as {{lang|la|[[foederati]]}}.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}}{{sfn|Elton|2018|p=172}} This marked the continuation of the tacit abandonment of a [[Danube\u2013Iller\u2013Rhine Limes|rigid Danube barrier]], which had previously been manned by Roman {{lang|la|[[laeti]]}}, barbarians settled directly in Roman land in exchange for military service. For some time before Marcian, the {{lang|la|laeti}} had been replaced by {{lang|la|foederati}}, although the distinction between the two was increasingly breaking down. Marcian's successors would grant the status of {{lang|la|foederati}} to multiple peoples and ceding them lands in the recovered European provinces: the Rugians in eastern Thrace, Sciri in [[Lower Moesia]] and [[Scythia]], Gepids in [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]]. This network of subject peoples, who were generally reliable and manageable, was beneficial to the Eastern Empire. The various tribal peoples generally kept each other's power in check without Roman intervention. They could also be induced to serve the empire against its enemies by way of gifts, subsidies, and treaties.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|pp=89\u201391}} After the death of Attila, Marcian enjoyed a relatively peaceful reign, although he won some small campaigns against the [[Saracens]] in [[Roman Syria|Syria]] and against the [[Blemmyes]] in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}\n\n===Religious policy===\n[[File:Fourth ecumenical council of chalcedon - 1876.jpg|thumb|''Fourth Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon'', 1876&nbsp;painting by [[Vasily Surikov]]|alt=A wall painting of the Council of Chalcedon showing Marcian and Pulcheria seated on thrones.]]\nShortly before Marcian became emperor, the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] was held in 449. The council stated that Jesus had one divine united nature, called {{lang|la|[[miaphysitism|miaphysis]]}}; this was rejected by the [[Pope]] and the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] due to disputes on the matter of [[Christology]], as the Pope and Patriarch of Constantinople saw the belief in miaphysis as [[heretical]].{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=99 & 105}}{{sfn|Davis|2004|p=81}}\n\nTo repudiate the Second Council of Ephesus, Marcian convened a new council of the imperial church, deemed to pass [[ecumenical council|universally respected canons]], in 451. Pulcheria may have influenced this decision or even made the convention of a council a requirement during her negotiations with Aspar to marry Marcian. The council was to take place near Constantinople so that the government could watch the proceedings closely. Initially, it was to be held at the city of [[Nicaea]], which held enormous religious importance to the early church, as it was the site of its first council, the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. However, Marcian successfully requested the transfer of the location to [[Chalcedon]]. This was closer to Constantinople and would allow him to respond quickly to any events along the Danube frontier. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] met in October 451. About 500 [[bishops]] attended it, most of them Eastern Roman, although two African bishops and two Papal legates sent by [[Pope Leo&nbsp;I]] attended.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=145}}{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=585}}{{sfn|Whitworth|2017|p=360}} This council condemned the Second Council of Ephesus and agreed that Jesus had a divine nature ({{lang|la|[[physis]]}}) and a human nature, united in one person ({{lang|la|[[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|hypostasis]]}}), \"without confusion, change, division, or separation.\"{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=146}}\n\nThe council also agreed to condemn the Coptic [[Pope Dioscorus&nbsp;I of Alexandria]], who had overseen the Second Council of Ephesus, and revoke the condemnations of [[Ibas of Edessa]] and [[Theodoret]], which had taken place during this Council. The council also repeated the importance of the [[See of Constantinople]], placing it firmly in second place behind the See of Rome, and giving it the right to appoint bishops in the Eastern Roman Empire, over the objection of Pope Leo I;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} the Patriarchs of Alexandria also objected to the elevation of the See of Constantinople.{{sfn|Bauer|2010|p=122}} The council ended in November 451, after which Marcian issued numerous [[edicts]] confirming the outcomes of the council;{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=147}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=814}} showing that the outcome of the council was not universally accepted.{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=148}} One such edict ordered the repression of [[Eutychianism|Eutychianists]], who did not believe in the hypostatic union of Jesus' two natures, barring them from holding state offices, forbidding them from criticizing the Council of Chalcedon, and ordering their literature, along with that of the [[Nestorians]], to be burned.{{sfn|Bury|2012|p=380}} \n\nThe anti-Miaphysite resolutions of the council led to a large increase in civil disruption in the eastern provinces of Syria and Egypt, where the majority of the population was Miaphysitic. Several violent revolts were put down with military force after significant bloodshed, in Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch;{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|p=105}} as well as sending the military to suppress monks in [[Palaestina Prima|Palestine]]<!--Please note that this was the proper Roman name for the province and has no relation to the modern Israel\u2013Palestine debates.--> and placing troops in [[Alexandria]] to ensure the installation of [[Proterius of Alexandria]], who was to replace the deposed [[Pope Dioscorus I of Alexandria|Pope Dioscorus I]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} According to the Byzantist [[Alexander Vasiliev (historian)|Alexander Vasiliev]], even after these revolts were put down, the popular dissatisfaction with the state church among the Miaphysite and Nestorian population remained, as the eastern provinces became increasingly convinced of their need for independence from the Eastern Roman Empire. Vasiliev states that this would lead to long-lasting disloyalty toward the Eastern Roman government among the eastern provinces, ultimately facilitating the loss of these provinces to the Sassanians and later to the [[Arabs]].{{Sfn|Vasiliev|1980|pp=105\u2013106}} As an additional result of the council and the following edicts, many Christians who disagreed with the council, including many Nestorians, migrated to the [[Sassanian Empire]].{{sfn|Bauer|2010|pp=122\u2013123}} The separation of the Miaphysites from the churches accepting Chalcedonian doctrine would be made final after the failed attempts of reconciliation under Emperor [[Justinian I]] ({{Reign|527|565}}), with the Miaphysites splitting the [[Oriental Orthodox Churches]] from the main body of Christians.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|pp=194\u2013202}}\n\nMarcian also funded Pulcheria's extensive building projects until her death in July 453.

Marcian reversed this near bankruptcy, not by levying new taxes, but by cutting expenditure.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Upon his accession, he declared a remission of all debts owed to the state.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian attempted to improve the efficiency of the state in multiple ways.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian laid out legal reforms in his [[Novel (Roman law)|novels]], or codes of law, containing 20 laws, many of which were targeted at reducing the corruption and abuses of office that had existed during the reign of Theodosius; five of which are preserved in full.{{sfn|Jones|1986|p=217}}{{sfn|Pharr|Davidson|Pharr|2001|p=562}}\n\nMarcian mandated that the office of [[praetorship]] (officer in charge of public games and works) could only be given to [[Byzantine Senate#Admission and composition|senators]] who resided in Constantinople, attempted to curb the practice of selling administrative offices, and decreed that [[Roman consul|consuls]] should be responsible for the maintenance of [[Valens Aqueduct|Constantinople's aqueducts]]. He repealed the {{lang|la|[[Follis (tax)|follis]]}}, a tax on senators' property that amounted to seven pounds of gold per annum.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} Marcian removed the financial responsibilities of the [[Roman consul|consuls]] and praetors, held since the time of the [[Roman Republic]], to fund public sports and games or give wealth to the citizens of Constantinople, respectively. In addition, he made it so that only a {{lang|la|[[vir illustris]]}} (a high-ranking man) could hold either office.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} He also partially repealed a marriage law enacted by [[Constantine I]], which decreed that a man of senatorial status could not marry a slave, [[freedwoman]], actress, or woman of no social status ({{lang|la|[[Honestiores and humiliores|humilis]]}}), which had been created in an attempt to preserve the purity of the senatorial class. Marcian adjusted this law by declaring that the law should not exclude a woman of good character, regardless of her social status or wealth.{{sfn|Bury|2012|pp=236\u2013237}} By the time of his death, Marcian's shrewd cutting of expenditures and his avoidance of large-scale wars left the Eastern Roman treasury with a surplus of {{convert|100,000|lb}} of gold.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} \n\nIn 451, Marcian decreed that anyone who performed [[Paganism|pagan rites]] would lose their property and be condemned to death and that no pagan temples, which had previously been closed, could be reopened. To ensure this law was implemented, he set a penalty of {{convert|50|lb|kg}} of gold for any judge, governor or official who did not enforce the law.{{sfn|Evans|2002|p=66}}\n\n===Politics===\nWhen Marcian became emperor, he was influenced by Flavius Zeno, Pulcheria, and Aspar. Flavius Zeno died soon after Marcian ascended the throne, possibly as early as the end of 451,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=97}} and Pulcheria died in July 453, leaving Aspar as the only major influence in the court of the Eastern Roman Empire. This influence was enhanced by the promotion of his son Ardabur to {{lang|la|magister militum per Orientem}}.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}} It is unknown if Aspar and Ardabur influenced Marcian{{'}}s policies directly, but if so, they were extremely careful to avoid upsetting the ruling elites of Constantinople. Despite Aspar's great influence, the Eastern Roman elites retained much of their anti-German sentiment.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} Marcian's principal advisors were Pulcheria, [[Euphemius (Magister officiorum)|Euphemius]] the {{lang|la|[[magister officiorum]]}} (master of offices), [[Palladius (praetor)|Palladius]] the praetor, and [[Anatolius of Constantinople]].{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=305}} In 453, Marcian had his daughter from a previous marriage, [[Marcia Euphemia]], marry [[Anthemius]], an aristocrat and talented general.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}\n\nMarcian patronized the Blues, who were one of the [[Deme#Later usage|two circus teams]], the other being the Greens. The two teams had become more like political parties than sports teams by his time, wielding large influence in the empire; both vied for power. After the Greens responded angrily to his patronage, Marcus censured them, forbidding any of them to hold any public office for three years. Marcian's patronage of the Blues may have had personal motivations, as the once powerful Chrysaphius had been favorable to the Greens.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Christophilopoulou|1986|p=286}}{{sfn|Bury|1923|p=85}}\n\n===Foreign relations===\nThe Armenian king [[Vardan II Mamikonian]], who was leading a revolt against the Sassanian Empire, sent an embassy to Theodosius in 450, composed of his brother [[Hmayeak Mamikonian]], along with [[Atom Gnuni]], [[Vardan Amatuni]], and [[Meruzhan Artsruni (emissary)|Meruzhan Artsruni]], to ask for assistance. Theodosius received it favorably. Any plans were cut short by his death and the accession of Marcian.{{Sfn|Manoogian|1984|p=23}}{{Sfn|Lacey|2016|p=142}} Marcian was counseled by the diplomat [[Anatolius (consul)|Anatolius]] and {{lang|la|patricius}} [[Florentius (consul 429)|Florentius]] not to make war with the Sassanians, as it would engulf a large amount of the Eastern Roman military resources, and thus Marcian did not agree to help them.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=85\u201386}}{{sfn|Amirav|2015|p=55 & 93}}\n\nLater on, in {{circa}} 456, Marcian risked the anger of the Sassanians to strike against King [[Gubazes I of Lazica]]\u2014nominally a vassal state of the Eastern Roman Empire\u2014who was attempting to form an alliance with the Sassanians to break free of Eastern Roman control. Marcian launched a military campaign against him in 456, forcing him to acknowledge Eastern Roman rule. He also forced Gubazes to abdicate in favor of his son, [[Damnazes]].{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|p=346}}{{failed verification|date=April 2020}} In 455 Marcian banned the export to barbarian tribes of weapons and the tools used to manufacture them.{{sfn|Holmes|Singleton|Jones|2001}}\n\n===Relationship with the Western Roman Empire===\nMarcian was elected without any consultation with the Western Roman Emperor, Valentinian&nbsp;III\u2013 a clear indication of further separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires than before his reign.{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=243}}{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=42}} Valentinian would later recognize Marcian as the Eastern Roman Emperor, although the date of his recognition is disputed; Lee states that Valentinian recognized Marcian in March 452,{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43}} whereas historian [[Timothy E. Gregory]] states that Marcian was recognized by Valentinian on 30 March 451.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}} Marcian{{'}}s appointment marked a further stage of separation between the Eastern and Western Roman Empires.{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=243}} One source, [[John of Antioch (chronicler)|John of Antioch's]] {{lang|la|Excerpta de insidiis}}, even suggest that Valentinian would have attempted to depose Marcian, but for Aetius{{'}} opposition.{{sfn|Lee|2001|p=43f}} Valentinian also did not recognize the Eastern Roman consulS for 451 or 452.{{sfn|McEvoy|2013|p=290, note 84}} The Western Roman chronicler [[Hydatius]] suggests that Marcian made Eastern Roman troops available to Valentinian to repel the Huns, confusingly led by a man named Aetius, which may simply be a muddling of Aetius' campaign against Attila and Marcian's campaign against the Huns on the Danube.{{sfn|McEvoy|2013|p=294}}\n\nWhen Marcian granted part of Pannonia to the Ostrogoths, and [[Tisza]] to the Gepids, he was accused of encroaching upon the border of Western Roman land.{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=307}} Marcian avoided involving himself with the affairs of the Western Roman Empire when possible. When the Vandals attacked the Western Roman Empire and [[Sack of Rome (455)|sacked Rome]] in 455, after [[Petronius Maximus]] assassinated Valentinian&nbsp;III and broke an [[engagement]] treaty with the Vandals, Marcian did not respond violently, possibly due to the influence of Aspar. He merely sent an envoy demanding that the Vandals return the [[Dowager Empress]], [[Licinia Eudoxia]] and her daughters by Valentinian III, [[Placidia]] and [[Eudocia (daughter of Valentinian&nbsp;III)|Eudocia]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}} A likely false account is given that Marcian, while captured by the Vandals in his youth, was shaded by an eagle while the other prisoners suffered the hot sun. According to this account, the Vandal King Gaiseric recognized that Marcian would later be emperor. In exchange for being released, he made Marcia pledge not to attack the Vandals should he become emperor.{{efn|name=A|Propaganda involving the story of an eagle blocking the sun, and another figure recognizing they would be emperor, was used by both Byzantine emperors [[Philippikos Bardanes]] and [[Basil&nbsp;I]].{{sfn|Lilie|2014|p=193}}}} This account originates from [[Priscus]], who served as an advisor to Euphemius, the {{lang|la|magister officiorum}}. Due to Euphemius' influence over foreign policy, some historians, such as [[Edward Arthur Thompson]], have suggested that this account was a part of official imperial propaganda, which was generated to excuse Marcian's lack of retribution towards the Vandals, and quell any discontent.{{sfn|Thompson|1950|p=68}} Marcian made several diplomatic attempts to have the prisoners returned, before finally beginning to plan an invasion of the Vandal's territory shortly before his death.{{sfn|Clover|1978|pp=193\u2013194}} The historian [[Frank Clover]] has suggested that this sudden reversal of policy was caused by the marriage of Eudocia to [[Huneric]], the son of Gaiseric, which led to such pressure from Eastern Roman elites that Marcian was forced to begin preparations for war to ensure the return of the hostages.{{sfn|Clover|1978|p=194}} Around this time, Marcian made peace with Lazica, which would allow him to direct his attention elsewhere. The East Roman historian [[Theodorus Lector]] speaks of Marcian's sudden reversal of policy, and [[Evagrius Scholasticus]], a Roman historian writing a century after the event, states that the Vandals released Licinia Eudoxia, Placidia, and Eudocia to Marcian after he threatened them with war,{{sfn|Clover|1978|p=194}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=243}} in either late 556 or early 557.{{sfn|Clover|1978|p=194}}\n\nMarcian did not recognize any Western Emperor after Valentinian, denying Petronius Maximus, now Western Emperor, when he sent an embassy requesting it, and similarly refusing to recognize [[Avitus]], who succeeded Maximus.{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1296}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=704}} Marcian's exact treatment of Avitus is debated. The Roman historian [[Hydatius]] states that in 455 Avitus sent \"[ambassadors] to Marcian for the sake of unanimity of power,\" and that, \"Marcian and Avitus make use of Roman power in concord\". The exact usage of concord ({{lang|la|concordia}} in the original Latin) has led to debate among scholars. Some such as [[Thomas Hodgkin (historian)|Thomas Hodgkin]], [[J. B. Bury]], and [[William Bayless]] consider it grounds for the belief that Marcian may have recognized Avitus. Most scholars take a more conservative stance on it; [[Ernst Stein]] suggests that it is merely a reflection of West Roman propaganda, whereas [[Norman Baynes]] believes it indicates that Marcian was cordial to Avitus, neither hostile nor friendly.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}{{sfn|Baynes|1922|p=223}} [[C. E. Stevens]] interprets the phrase as meaning only that the meeting of the diplomats was amicable, rather than reflecting a relationship between the two states.{{sfn|Mathisen|1981|p=237}}\n\nThe historian [[Geoffrey Nathan]] suggests the fact that only two Western delegates attended the Council of Chalcedon points to a new level of Western Roman self-absorption in their own political and religious affairs. He mentions that the canon from this council delegating authority over the whole east to the See of Constantinople marks a religious separation. Authority over the Church in the Eastern Roman Empire would prove a point of contention between Rome and Constantinople, leading up to the [[East\u2013West Schism]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}\n\n==Death==\nMarcian's reign ended on 26 January 457, when he died, possibly of [[gangrene]]{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}}\u2014according to some legends during a long religious procession from the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Grand Palace]] to the [[Hebdomon]], where he made the journey on foot, despite the fact that he could barely walk due to severe foot [[inflammation]], possibly [[gout]].{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}}{{sfn|Kelly|2013|p=240}} He was buried in the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], in Constantinople, next to his wife Pulcheria,{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} in a [[Porphyry (geology)#Imperial sarcophagi|porphyry sarcophagus]] that was described in the 10th century by [[Constantine VII|Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]] in the {{lang|la|[[De Ceremoniis]]}}.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1948|pp=p1 & 3\u201326}} He left the Eastern Empire with seven million [[solidi]] in its treasury, an impressive achievement considering the economic ruin inflicted upon Eastern Rome by the Huns, both through warfare and the massive subsidies they received under Theodosius.{{sfn|Friell|Williams|2005|p=127}} \n\nAlthough Marcian had a son-in-law, Anthemius, he did not have any connection to the Theodosians, which Marcian himself had gained through his marriage to Pulcheria, and thus would not be considered a legitimate dynastic heir, so Aspar was once again left to play the role of emperor-maker. He selected [[Leo I the Thracian|Leo&nbsp;I]], a fifty-year-old officer commanding a unit in the [[praesental]] army. A later source claims that the [[Eastern Roman Senate]] offered to elect Aspar himself, but he declined, with the cryptic comment: \"I fear that a tradition in ruling might be initiated through me\". This comment has often been interpreted to be a reference to the fact that he was an [[Arian]],{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Lee|2013|p=98}}{{sfn|Meijer|2004|p=154}} or else to his Alanic heritage.{{sfn|Norwich|1998|p=51}}\n\nAnthemius would later be sent by Leo to become the [[Western Roman]] [[Roman Emperor|emperor]];{{Sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Dzino|Parry|2017|p=258}}{{sfn|Mathisen|1998}} Leo nominated him to be Western Emperor in the spring of 467, to fill the vacancy left by the death of Emperor [[Libius Severus]] since 465. Leo sent Anthemius to Rome with an army, headed by [[Marcellinus (magister militum)|Marcellinus]], the {{lang|la|magister militum}} of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]; upon nearing Rome, Anthemius was installed as emperor on 12 April 467.{{sfn|Mathisen|1998}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20111224 Flavius Marcianus Augustus Column Fatih Istanbul Turkey.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Color photograph of an ancient stone column set in front of a modern building and parked cars.

Some later scholars attribute his success not just to his skill, but also to a large degree of luck: not only had he been fortunate enough to have Pulcheria to legitimize his rule, for much of it the two greatest external threats to Rome, the Sassanian Empire and the Huns, were absorbed with their own internal problems; additionally, no natural disasters or plagues occurred during his reign.{{sfn|Nathan|1998}}{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=306}}{{sfn|Gregory|1991|p=1297}} He was remembered fondly by the people of Constantinople, who would shout \"Reign like Marcian!\" at the installation of future emperors.{{sfn|Grant|1985|p=307}}\n\n===Buildings===\nThe {{lang|la|praefectus urbi}} (urban prefect) [[Tatianus]] built a [[Column of Marcian|column]] dedicated to Marcian, sometime between 450 and 452.{{sfn|Jones|Martindale|Morris|1980|pp=1053\u20131054}}{{sfn|D'Ayala |Fodde |2008|p=1167}} It still stands in Istanbul, near the north branch of the [[Mese (Constantinople)|Mese]],{{sfn|Gallagher|2008|p=204}} though the statue of Marcian that originally topped it has been lost.{{sfn|Freely|\u00c7akmak|2004|p=63}} Marcian also had a statue in the [[Forum of Arcadius]], which contained the statues of several of the successors of Emperor [[Arcadius]].{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991a|p=1347}} Marcian may have been the sponsor of the [[Chrysotriklinos]] of the Great Palace of Constantinople. The {{lang|la|[[Patria of Constantinople]]}} states that Marcian constructed it, whereas the 10th century encyclopedia {{lang|la|[[Suda]]}} states that Emperor [[Justin&nbsp;II]] built it, a view with which most historians agree.

Neihu means \"inner lake.\" The older name originates from the [[Ketagalan]] word ''Tayour'' (transliterated by the Dutch as ''Cattajo''), meaning woman's head ornament.\n\nMany mountainous roads and paths, which are ideal for hiking, connect Neihu with the neighboring [[Shilin District]] and [[Yangmingshan National Park]]. The Tri-Service General Hospital, which is a teaching hospital of the National Defense Medical Center, is also in Neihu. The [[Wuchih Mountain Military Cemetery]] borders Neihu.\n\n==History==\nDuring [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], Naiko Village ({{lang|zh-tw|\u5167\u6e56\u838a}}) covered modern day Neihu in addition to [[Nangang District, Taipei|Nangang]]. The village was under Shichisei District, [[Taihoku Prefecture]].\n\n==Economy==\n[[Image:Bank_of_Keelung_River_in_Neihu.jpg|thumb|left|Taipei Neihu Technology Park]]\nAlthough it is a flood-prone region, Neihu has experienced huge growth{{When|date=September 2018}} with the construction of the Neihu Technology Park and hypermarkets such as [[Costco]], [[RT Mart]], [[Carrefour]], [[B&Q]]. The extension of the [[Taipei Metro]] to Neihu in the 1990s and early 2000s has also boosted residential and commercial growth. [[TransAsia Airways]], [[Delta Electronics]] and [[RT-Mart]] have their headquarters in the district.<ref>\"[http://www.tna.com.tw/en/img/foot_01.gif foot_01.gif].\" (English) [[TransAsia Airways]].

These characters' lives intertwine and collide as they find themselves in the middle of an ongoing conflict between the Guilty Remnant and the townspeople of Mapleton.\n\nIn the second season, the location shifts from Mapleton to the fictional town of Jarden, [[Texas]], where not a single citizen was lost in the Sudden Departure. The Murphy family becomes a key focal point of the season. The patriarch, John, is the chief firefighter of the town. His wife, Erika, is a doctor. Their son, Michael, is a priest and their daughter, Evie, is a high school student with [[epilepsy]]. The Garvey family, Nora, and Matt move to Jarden at a time which coincides with an incident that leads to the disappearance of three young girls, followed by mass panic and chaos that threatens the town's safety and forces the Garvey and Murphy families to confront their inner demons.\n\nThe third and final season unfolds three years later, in 2018, starting 14 days before the seventh anniversary of the Sudden Departure. The setting of third season moves between Jarden and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria, Australia]], as most of the lead characters\u2014particularly the Garvey and Murphy families\u2014undergo emotional journeys that make them reflect upon their lives, their beliefs and the events they have encountered in the previous two seasons. Kevin's father, the mentally ill former chief of police of Mapleton is also a main focus in the final season as he embarks on a spiritual journey to fulfill a cryptic purpose, and eventually crosses paths with the other members of the Murphy and Garvey families.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n*[[Justin Theroux]] as Kevin Garvey, initially Mapleton's chief of police and a father of two, who is trying to maintain some semblance of normalcy in this new world.\n*[[Amy Brenneman]] as Lorelei \"Laurie\" Garvey, Kevin's wife, who left her life behind to join a mysterious cult called the Guilty Remnant.\n*[[Christopher Eccleston]] as Matt Jamison, a former reverend and current editor of a self-published tabloid that outs sinners.

Cool is also featured on the album's cover. It is the band's last album as a quartet, as [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] reverted to being a touring member in 2016.\n\n''\u00a1Tr\u00e9!'' was released on December 7, 2012 in Australia, December 10 in the UK and December 11 in the US, through [[Reprise Records]], and was produced by their long-time producer [[Rob Cavallo]]. Producing first week sales of 58,000 copies, a low for the band, the album received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Recording and release==\nOn April 11, 2012, Green Day announced that they would be releasing a trilogy of albums titled ''\u00a1Uno!'', ''\u00a1Dos!'', and ''\u00a1Tr\u00e9!'' and stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013, respectively, through Reprise Records.<ref name=\"prrelease\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1682949/green-day-uno-dos-tres-albums.jhtml|title=Green Day Recording a Trilogy of Albums|work=MTV News|publisher=MTV Networks|first=Katie|last=Byrne|date=April 11, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a386556/green-day-confirm-new-albums-uno-dos-tre-release-dates.html|title=Green Day confirm new albums '\u00a1Uno! \u00a1Dos! \u00a1Tr\u00e9!' release dates|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias]]|first=Lewis|last=Corner|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref> On August 22, Armstrong gave preview of some songs through his [[iPhone]] on Zane Lowe's show on BBC Radio 1 in the UK.

Cool is also featured on the album's cover. It is the band's last album as a quartet, as [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] reverted to being a touring member in 2016.\n\n''\u00a1Tr\u00e9!'' was released on December 7, 2012 in Australia, December 10 in the UK and December 11 in the US, through [[Reprise Records]], and was produced by their long-time producer [[Rob Cavallo]]. Producing first week sales of 58,000 copies, a low for the band, the album received generally positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Recording and release==\nOn April 11, 2012, Green Day announced that they would be releasing a trilogy of albums titled ''\u00a1Uno!'', ''\u00a1Dos!'', and ''\u00a1Tr\u00e9!'' and stated that they would be released on September 25, 2012, November 13, 2012, and January 15, 2013, respectively, through Reprise Records.<ref name=\"prrelease\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1682949/green-day-uno-dos-tres-albums.jhtml|title=Green Day Recording a Trilogy of Albums|work=MTV News|publisher=MTV Networks|first=Katie|last=Byrne|date=April 11, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a386556/green-day-confirm-new-albums-uno-dos-tre-release-dates.html|title=Green Day confirm new albums '\u00a1Uno! \u00a1Dos! \u00a1Tr\u00e9!' release dates|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias]]|first=Lewis|last=Corner|date=June 11, 2012|accessdate=June 15, 2012}}</ref> On August 22, Armstrong gave preview of some songs through his [[iPhone]] on Zane Lowe's show on BBC Radio 1 in the UK.
