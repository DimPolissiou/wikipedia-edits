AD 250. This is the earliest known fragment of the Epistle to Philemon.</div>}}{{Books of the New Testament}}{{Paul}}\nThe '''Epistle of Paul to Philemon''', known simply as '''Philemon''', is one of the books of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]]. It is a [[Prison literature|prison letter]], co-authored by [[Paul the Apostle]] with [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], to [[Saint Philemon|Philemon]], a leader in the [[Colossae|Colossian]] church. It deals with the themes of [[forgiveness]] and [[Reconciliation (theology)|reconciliation]]. Paul does not identify himself as an apostle with authority, but as \"a prisoner of Jesus Christ\", calling Timothy \"our brother\", and addressing Philemon as \"fellow labourer\" and \"brother.\"({{bibleref2|Philemon|1:1; 1:7; 1:20}}) [[Onesimus]], a slave that had departed from his master Philemon, was returning with this epistle wherein Paul asked Philemon to receive him as a \"brother beloved.\"({{bibleref2|Philemon|1:9\u201317}})\n\nPhilemon was a wealthy Christian, possibly a bishop<ref>[[Apostolic constitution|Const. Apost.]] [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/07157.htm VII, 46]</ref> of the [[house church]] that met in his home ({{bibleref2|Philemon|1:1\u20132|9|Philemon 1:1\u20132}}) in [[Colosse]]. This letter is now generally regarded as one of the [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles#undisputed|undisputed works of Paul]]. It is the shortest of Paul's [[Extant literature|extant letters]], consisting of only 335 words in the Greek text.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patzia|first1=A. G.|editor1-last=Hawthorne|editor1-first=Gerald F. |display-authors=etal |title=Dictionary of Paul and His Letters|date=1994|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0851106519|page=703|chapter=Philemon, Letter To}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Authorship===\nThe epistle of Philemon is attributed to the apostle Paul, and this attribution has rarely been questioned by scholars.{{sfn|Bruce|1984|p=191}} Along with six others, it is numbered among the \"undisputed letters\", which are widely considered to be authentically Pauline. The main challenge to the letter's authenticity came from a group of German scholars in the nineteenth century known as the [[T\u00fcbingen School]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=270}} Their leader, [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]], only accepted four New Testament epistles as genuinely written by Paul: [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[1 Corinthians|1]] and [[2 Corinthians]] and [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]]. Commenting on Philemon, Baur described the subject matter as \"so very singular as to arouse our suspicions,\"{{sfn|Baur|1875|p=81}} and concluded that it is perhaps a \"Christian romance serving to convey a genuine Christian idea.\"{{sfn|Baur|1875|p=84}}\n\nThe opening verse of the salutation also names [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] alongside Paul. This, however, does not mean that Timothy was the epistle's co-author. Rather, Paul regularly mentions others in the address if they have a particular connection with the recipient. In this case, Timothy may have encountered Philemon while accompanying Paul in his work in Ephesus.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=272}}\n\n===Occasion===\nAccording to the majority interpretation, Paul wrote this letter on behalf of Onesimus, a runaway slave who had wronged his owner Philemon. The details of the offence are unstated, although it is often assumed that Onesimus had fled after stealing money, as Paul states in verse 18 that if Onesimus owes anything, Philemon should charge this to Paul's account.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} Sometime after leaving, Onesimus came into contact with Paul, although again the details are unclear. He may have been arrested and imprisoned alongside Paul. Alternatively, he may have previously heard Paul's name (as his owner was a Christian) and so travelled to him for help.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} After meeting Paul, Onesimus became a Christian believer. An affection grew between them, and Paul would have been glad to keep Onesimus with him. However, he considered it better to send him back to Philemon with an accompanying letter, which aimed to effect reconciliation between them as Christian brothers. The preservation of the letter suggests that Paul's request was granted.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=268}}\n\nOnesimus' status as a runaway slave was challenged by Allen Dwight Callahan in an article published in the ''Harvard Theological Review'' and in a later commentary. Callahan argues that, beyond verse 16, \"nothing in the text conclusively indicates that Onesimus was ever the chattel of the letter's chief addressee. Moreover, the expectations fostered by the traditional fugitive slave hypothesis go unrealized in the letter. Modern commentators, even those committed to the prevailing interpretation, have tacitly admitted as much.\"{{sfn|Callahan|1993|p=362}} Callahan argues that the earliest commentators on this work \u2013 the homily of [[Origen]] and the Anti-Marcion Preface \u2013 are silent about Onesimus' possible servile status, and traces the origins of this interpretation to [[John Chrysostom]], who proposed it in his ''Homiliae in epistolam ad Philemonem'', during his ministry in [[Antioch]], circa 386\u2013398.{{sfn|Callahan|1993|p=366}} In place of the traditional interpretation, Callahan suggests that Onesimus and Philemon are brothers both by blood and religion, but who have become estranged, and the intent of this letter was to reconcile the two men.{{sfn|Callahan|1993|pp=369ff}} [[Ben Witherington III]] has challenged Callahan's interpretation as a misreading of Paul's rhetoric.{{sfn|Witherington|2007|pp=62\u201363}} Further, Margaret M. Mitchell has demonstrated that a number of writers before Chrysostom either argue or assume that Onesimus was a runaway slave, including [[Athanasius]], [[Basil of Caesarea]] and [[Ambrosiaster]].{{sfn|Mitchell|1995|pp=145\u201346}}\n\nThe only extant information about Onesimus apart from this letter is found in Paul's epistle to the Colossians 4:7\u20139, where Onesimus is called \"a faithful and beloved brother\":\n\n{{quote|All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, ''who is'' a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: <sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; <sup>9</sup> With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is ''one'' of you. They shall make known unto you all things which ''are done'' here.}}\n\n===Recipient===\nThe letter is addressed to [[Philemon (New Testament person)|Philemon]], Apphia and Archippus, and the church in Philemon's house. Philemon is described as a \"fellow worker\" of Paul. It is generally assumed that he lived in Colossae; in the letter to the Colossians, Onesimus (the slave who fled from Philemon) and Archippus (whom Paul greets in the letter to Philemon) are described as members of the church there.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=266}} Philemon may have converted to Christianity through Paul's ministry, possibly in [[Ephesus]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|pp=266-67}} Apphia in the salutation is probably Philemon's wife.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} Some have speculated that Archippus, described by Paul as a \"fellow soldier\", is the son of Philemon and Apphia.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}}\n\nThe American John Knox proposed that Onesimus' owner was in fact Archippus, and the letter was addressed to him rather than Philemon. In this reconstruction, Philemon would receive the letter first and then encourage Archippus to release Onesimus so that he could work alongside Paul. This view, however, has not found widespread support.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} In particular, Knox's view has been challenged on the basis of the opening verses. According to O'Brien, the fact that Philemon's name is mentioned first, together with the use of the phrase \"in your house\" in verse 2, makes it unlikely that Archippus was the primary addressee.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} Knox further argued that the letter was intended to be read aloud in the Colossian church in order to put pressure on Archippus. A number of commentators, however, see this view as contradicting the tone of the letter.{{sfn|Bruce|1984|pp=404\u201305}}{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=268}} [[J. B. Lightfoot]], for example, wrote: \"The tact and delicacy of the Apostle's pleading for Onesimus would be nullified at one stroke by the demand for publication.\"{{sfn|Lightfoot|1879|p=281}}\n\n==Content==\n\n===Greeting and introduction (1\u20133)===\nThe opening salutation follows a typical pattern found in other Pauline letters. Paul first introduces himself, with a self-designation as a \"prisoner of Jesus Christ,\" which in this case refers to a physical imprisonment. He also mentions his associate Timothy, as a valued colleague who was presumably known to the recipient. As well as addressing the letter to Philemon, Paul sends greetings to Apphia, Archippus and the church that meets in Philemon's house. Apphia is often presumed to be Philemon's wife and Archippus, a \"fellow labourer\", is sometimes suggested to be their son. Paul concludes his salutation with a prayerful wish for grace and peace.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=274}}\n\n===Thanksgiving and intercession (4\u20137)===\nBefore addressing the main topic of the letter, Paul continues with a paragraph of thanksgiving and intercession. This serves to prepare the ground for Paul's central request. He gives thanks to God for Philemon's love and faith and prays for his faith to be effective. He concludes this paragraph by describing the joy and comfort he has received from knowing how Philemon has shown love towards the Christians in Colossae.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=283}}\n\n===Paul's plea for Onesimus (8\u201320)===\nAs a background to his specific plea for Onesimus, Paul clarifies his intentions and circumstances. Although he has the boldness to command Philemon to do what would be right in the circumstances, he prefers to base his appeal on his knowledge of Philemon's love and generosity. He also describes the affection he has for Onesimus and the transformation that has taken place with Onesimus's conversion to the Christian faith. Where Onesimus was \"useless\", now he is \"useful\" \u2013 a wordplay, as Onesimus means \"useful\". Paul indicates that he would have been glad to keep Onesimus with him, but recognised that it was right to send him back. Paul's specific request is for Philemon to welcome Onesimus as he would welcome Paul, namely as a Christian brother. He offers to pay for any debt created by Onesimus' departure and expresses his desire that Philemon might refresh his heart in Christ.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=303}}\n\n===Conclusion and greetings (21\u201325)===\nIn the final section of the letter, Paul describes his confidence that Philemon would do even more than he had requested, perhaps indicating his desire for Onesimus to return to work alongside him. He also mentions his wish to visit and asks Philemon to prepare a guest room. Paul sends greetings from five of his co-workers and concludes the letter with a [[benediction]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=309}}\n\n==Themes==\nPaul uses slavery vs. freedom language more often in his writings as a metaphor.<ref>Foster, Paul. \"Philippians And Philemon: Sacra Pagina Commentary.\" p.174</ref> At this time slavery was common, and can be seen as a theme in the book of Philemon. Slavery was most commonly found in households. This letter, seemingly, provided alleviation of suffering of some slaves due to the fact that Paul placed pastoral focus on the issue.<ref>Foster, Paul. \"Philippians And Philemon: Sacra Pagina Commentary.\" p.176</ref>\n\nAlthough it is a main theme, Paul does not label slavery as negative or positive.

This is the earliest known fragment of the Epistle to Philemon.</div>}}{{Books of the New Testament}}{{Paul}}\nThe '''Epistle of Paul to Philemon''', known simply as '''Philemon''', is one of the books of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]]. It is a [[Prison literature|prison letter]], co-authored by [[Paul the Apostle]] with [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]], to [[Saint Philemon|Philemon]], a leader in the [[Colossae|Colossian]] church. It deals with the themes of [[forgiveness]] and [[Reconciliation (theology)|reconciliation]]. Paul does not identify himself as an apostle with authority, but as \"a prisoner of Jesus Christ\", calling Timothy \"our brother\", and addressing Philemon as \"fellow labourer\" and \"brother.\"<ref>{{bibleref2|Philemon|1:1; 1:7; 1:20|9}}</ref> [[Onesimus]], a slave that had departed from his master Philemon, was returning with this epistle wherein Paul asked Philemon to receive him as a \"brother beloved.\"<ref>verse 1:16 in {{bibleref2|Philemon|1:9\u201317|9|Philemon 1:9\u201317}}</ref>\n\nPhilemon was a wealthy Christian, possibly a bishop<ref>[[Apostolic constitution|Const. Apost.]] [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/07157.htm VII, 46]</ref> of the [[house church]] that met in his home ({{bibleref2|Philemon|1:1\u20132|9|Philemon 1:1\u20132}}) in [[Colosse]]. This letter is now generally regarded as one of the [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles#undisputed|undisputed works of Paul]]. It is the shortest of Paul's [[Extant literature|extant letters]], consisting of only 335 words in the Greek text.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patzia|first1=A. G.|editor1-last=Hawthorne|editor1-first=Gerald F. |display-authors=etal |title=Dictionary of Paul and His Letters|date=1994|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0851106519|page=703|chapter=Philemon, Letter To}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n\n===Authorship===\nThe epistle of Philemon is attributed to the apostle Paul, and this attribution has rarely been questioned by scholars.{{sfn|Bruce|1984|p=191}} Along with six others, it is numbered among the \"undisputed letters\", which are widely considered to be authentically Pauline. The main challenge to the letter's authenticity came from a group of German scholars in the nineteenth century known as the [[T\u00fcbingen School]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=270}} Their leader, [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]], only accepted four New Testament epistles as genuinely written by Paul: [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]], [[1 Corinthians|1]] and [[2 Corinthians]] and [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]]. Commenting on Philemon, Baur described the subject matter as \"so very singular as to arouse our suspicions,\"{{sfn|Baur|1875|p=81}} and concluded that it is perhaps a \"Christian romance serving to convey a genuine Christian idea.\"{{sfn|Baur|1875|p=84}}\n\nThe opening verse of the salutation also names [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] alongside Paul. This, however, does not mean that Timothy was the epistle's co-author. Rather, Paul regularly mentions others in the address if they have a particular connection with the recipient. In this case, Timothy may have encountered Philemon while accompanying Paul in his work in Ephesus.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=272}}\n\n===Occasion===\nAccording to the majority interpretation, Paul wrote this letter on behalf of Onesimus, a runaway slave who had wronged his owner Philemon. The details of the offence are unstated, although it is often assumed that Onesimus had fled after stealing money, as Paul states in verse 18 that if Onesimus owes anything, Philemon should charge this to Paul's account.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} Sometime after leaving, Onesimus came into contact with Paul, although again the details are unclear. He may have been arrested and imprisoned alongside Paul. Alternatively, he may have previously heard Paul's name (as his owner was a Christian) and so travelled to him for help.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} After meeting Paul, Onesimus became a Christian believer. An affection grew between them, and Paul would have been glad to keep Onesimus with him. However, he considered it better to send him back to Philemon with an accompanying letter, which aimed to effect reconciliation between them as Christian brothers. The preservation of the letter suggests that Paul's request was granted.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=268}}\n\nOnesimus' status as a runaway slave was challenged by Allen Dwight Callahan in an article published in the ''Harvard Theological Review'' and in a later commentary. Callahan argues that, beyond verse 16, \"nothing in the text conclusively indicates that Onesimus was ever the chattel of the letter's chief addressee. Moreover, the expectations fostered by the traditional fugitive slave hypothesis go unrealized in the letter. Modern commentators, even those committed to the prevailing interpretation, have tacitly admitted as much.\"{{sfn|Callahan|1993|p=362}} Callahan argues that the earliest commentators on this work \u2013 the homily of [[Origen]] and the Anti-Marcion Preface \u2013 are silent about Onesimus' possible servile status, and traces the origins of this interpretation to [[John Chrysostom]], who proposed it in his ''Homiliae in epistolam ad Philemonem'', during his ministry in [[Antioch]], circa 386\u2013398.{{sfn|Callahan|1993|p=366}} In place of the traditional interpretation, Callahan suggests that Onesimus and Philemon are brothers both by blood and religion, but who have become estranged, and the intent of this letter was to reconcile the two men.{{sfn|Callahan|1993|pp=369ff}} [[Ben Witherington III]] has challenged Callahan's interpretation as a misreading of Paul's rhetoric.{{sfn|Witherington|2007|pp=62\u201363}} Further, Margaret M. Mitchell has demonstrated that a number of writers before Chrysostom either argue or assume that Onesimus was a runaway slave, including [[Athanasius]], [[Basil of Caesarea]] and [[Ambrosiaster]].{{sfn|Mitchell|1995|pp=145\u201346}}\n\nThe only extant information about Onesimus apart from this letter is found in Paul's epistle to the Colossians 4:7\u20139, where Onesimus is called \"a faithful and beloved brother\":\n\n{{quote|All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, ''who is'' a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord: <sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts; <sup>9</sup> With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is ''one'' of you. They shall make known unto you all things which ''are done'' here.}}\n\n===Recipient===\nThe letter is addressed to [[Philemon (New Testament person)|Philemon]], Apphia and Archippus, and the church in Philemon's house. Philemon is described as a \"fellow worker\" of Paul. It is generally assumed that he lived in Colossae; in the letter to the Colossians, Onesimus (the slave who fled from Philemon) and Archippus (whom Paul greets in the letter to Philemon) are described as members of the church there.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=266}} Philemon may have converted to Christianity through Paul's ministry, possibly in [[Ephesus]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|pp=266-67}} Apphia in the salutation is probably Philemon's wife.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} Some have speculated that Archippus, described by Paul as a \"fellow soldier\", is the son of Philemon and Apphia.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}}\n\nThe American John Knox proposed that Onesimus' owner was in fact Archippus, and the letter was addressed to him rather than Philemon. In this reconstruction, Philemon would receive the letter first and then encourage Archippus to release Onesimus so that he could work alongside Paul. This view, however, has not found widespread support.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} In particular, Knox's view has been challenged on the basis of the opening verses. According to O'Brien, the fact that Philemon's name is mentioned first, together with the use of the phrase \"in your house\" in verse 2, makes it unlikely that Archippus was the primary addressee.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=267}} Knox further argued that the letter was intended to be read aloud in the Colossian church in order to put pressure on Archippus. A number of commentators, however, see this view as contradicting the tone of the letter.{{sfn|Bruce|1984|pp=404\u201305}}{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=268}} [[J. B. Lightfoot]], for example, wrote: \"The tact and delicacy of the Apostle's pleading for Onesimus would be nullified at one stroke by the demand for publication.\"{{sfn|Lightfoot|1879|p=281}}\n\n==Content==\n\n===Greeting and introduction (1\u20133)===\nThe opening salutation follows a typical pattern found in other Pauline letters. Paul first introduces himself, with a self-designation as a \"prisoner of Jesus Christ,\" which in this case refers to a physical imprisonment. He also mentions his associate Timothy, as a valued colleague who was presumably known to the recipient. As well as addressing the letter to Philemon, Paul sends greetings to Apphia, Archippus and the church that meets in Philemon's house. Apphia is often presumed to be Philemon's wife and Archippus, a \"fellow labourer\", is sometimes suggested to be their son. Paul concludes his salutation with a prayerful wish for grace and peace.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=274}}\n\n===Thanksgiving and intercession (4\u20137)===\nBefore addressing the main topic of the letter, Paul continues with a paragraph of thanksgiving and intercession. This serves to prepare the ground for Paul's central request. He gives thanks to God for Philemon's love and faith and prays for his faith to be effective. He concludes this paragraph by describing the joy and comfort he has received from knowing how Philemon has shown love towards the Christians in Colossae.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=283}}\n\n===Paul's plea for Onesimus (8\u201320)===\nAs a background to his specific plea for Onesimus, Paul clarifies his intentions and circumstances. Although he has the boldness to command Philemon to do what would be right in the circumstances, he prefers to base his appeal on his knowledge of Philemon's love and generosity. He also describes the affection he has for Onesimus and the transformation that has taken place with Onesimus's conversion to the Christian faith. Where Onesimus was \"useless\", now he is \"useful\" \u2013 a wordplay, as Onesimus means \"useful\". Paul indicates that he would have been glad to keep Onesimus with him, but recognised that it was right to send him back. Paul's specific request is for Philemon to welcome Onesimus as he would welcome Paul, namely as a Christian brother. He offers to pay for any debt created by Onesimus' departure and expresses his desire that Philemon might refresh his heart in Christ.{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=303}}\n\n===Conclusion and greetings (21\u201325)===\nIn the final section of the letter, Paul describes his confidence that Philemon would do even more than he had requested, perhaps indicating his desire for Onesimus to return to work alongside him. He also mentions his wish to visit and asks Philemon to prepare a guest room. Paul sends greetings from five of his co-workers and concludes the letter with a [[benediction]].{{sfn|O'Brien|1982|p=309}}\n\n==Themes==\nPaul uses slavery vs. freedom language more often in his writings as a metaphor.<ref>Foster, Paul. \"Philippians And Philemon: Sacra Pagina Commentary.\" p.174</ref> At this time slavery was common, and can be seen as a theme in the book of Philemon. Slavery was most commonly found in households. This letter, seemingly, provided alleviation of suffering of some slaves due to the fact that Paul placed pastoral focus on the issue.<ref>Foster, Paul. \"Philippians And Philemon: Sacra Pagina Commentary.\" p.176</ref>\n\nAlthough it is a main theme, Paul does not label slavery as negative or positive.

The historic district of Old Strathcona, the [[University of Alberta]], the [[University of Alberta Campus Saint-Jean]] and the [[Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre]] are all located in the riding.\n\nEdmonton\u2013Strathcona encompasses the neighbourhoods of Allendale, Argyll, Avonmore, Belgravia, Bonnie Doon, Capilano, Cloverdale, Empire Park, Forest Heights, Fulton Place, Garneau,

district]] in [[Alberta]], Canada, that has been represented in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] since 1953. It spans the south central part of the city of [[Edmonton]]. Between 2008 and 2015, and from 2019 onwards, Edmonton\u2014Strathcona is currently the only federal riding in Alberta not held by the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe riding is home to most of Edmonton's [[Franco-Albertans|francophones]]. The historic district of Old Strathcona, the [[University of Alberta]], the [[University of Alberta Campus Saint-Jean]] and the [[Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre]] are all located in the riding.\n\nEdmonton\u2013Strathcona encompasses the neighbourhoods of Allendale, Argyll, Avonmore, Belgravia, Bonnie Doon, Capilano, Cloverdale, Empire Park, Forest Heights, Fulton Place, Garneau, Gold Bar, Grandview Heights, Hazeldean, Holyrood, Idylwylde, Kenilworth, King Edward Park, Lansdowne, Lendrum Place, Malmo Plains, McKernan, Ottewell, Parkallen, Pleasantview, Queen Alexandra Park, Ritchie, [[Riverdale, Edmonton|Riverdale]], Strathcona, Strathearn, Terrace Heights, and Windsor Park.\n\nIt borders on the federal ridings of [[Edmonton Centre]], [[Edmonton Griesbach]], [[Sherwood Park\u2014Fort Saskatchewan]], [[Edmonton Mill Woods]], and [[Edmonton Riverbend]].\n\nThis district is bounded:<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Federal Ridings since 1867|url={{CanRiding|ID=202|plainurl=y}}|publisher=Parliament of Canada|accessdate=27 March 2011}}</ref>\n* On the north by the [[North Saskatchewan River]] (except for a jog that goes around the neighbourhood of Riverdale, which is north of the river).\n* On the west by the Whitemud Creek from the North Saskatchewan River to Whitemud Drive.\n* On the south by Whitemud Drive, from Whitemud Creek to the City Limits.\n* On the east by Edmonton's City Limits.\n\n===Political geography===\nAs evidenced by the 2008 and 2011 elections, this riding is heavily polarized between more urban NDP voters concentrated in the northwest of the riding and suburban Conservative voters concentrated in the south and east.\n\nThe NDP picked up this seat in 2008 for the first time in its history, when Edmonton lawyer Linda Duncan defeated Tory incumbent Rahim Jaffer, thanks to a consolidation of non-Conservative votes.\n\n==Demographics==\n:''According to the [[Canada 2011 Census]]; 2013

MP, and a United Farmer of Alberta MP.\n\nThe electoral district  of \"Edmonton -Strathcona\" was created in 1952 from [[Edmonton East]] and [[Edmonton West]] ridings.\n\n\"Edmonton\u2014Strathcona\" gained territory from [[Edmonton East]] and was renamed \"Edmonton Strathcona\" during the [[Canadian federal electoral redistribution, 2012|2012 electoral redistribution]].\n\n===Members of
