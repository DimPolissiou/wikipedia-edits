He served as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|head of government]] of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] from 1917 to 1924 and of the [[Soviet Union]] from 1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia and then the wider Soviet Union became a [[one-party state|one-party]] [[communist state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Russian Communist Party]]. Ideologically a [[Communism|communist]], he developed a variant of [[Marxism]] known as [[Leninism]].\n\n<!--Early life and revolutionary activity-->\nBorn to a moderately prosperous middle-class family in [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]], Lenin embraced [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] politics following [[Aleksandr Ulyanov|his brother's]] 1887 execution. Expelled from [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]] for participating in protests against the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist government]], he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for [[sedition]] and exiled to [[Shushenskoye]] for three years, where he married [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik faction]] against [[Julius Martov]]'s [[Mensheviks]]. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed [[Revolution of 1905]], he later campaigned for the [[First World War]] to be transformed into a Europe-wide [[proletarian revolution]], which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] and its replacement with [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] ousted the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] and established a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the [[October Revolution]], in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.\n\n<!--October Revolution and Lenin's government-->\n[[Council of People's Commissars|Lenin's Bolshevik government]] initially shared power with the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], elected [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|soviets]], and a multi-party [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]], although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin's administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|treaty]] conceding territory to the [[Central Powers]], and promoted [[world revolution]] through the [[Communist International]]. Opponents were suppressed in the [[Red Terror]], a violent campaign administered by the [[Cheka|state security services]]; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] anti-Bolshevik armies in the [[Russian Civil War]] from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131921. Responding to wartime devastation, [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]], and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the market-oriented [[New Economic Policy]]. Several non-Russian nations had secured independence from the Russian Empire after 1917, but three were [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|re-united]] into the new [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|Soviet Union]] in 1922. His health failing, Lenin died in [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]], with [[Joseph Stalin]] succeeding him as the pre-eminent figure in the Soviet government.\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive [[cult of personality|personality cult]] within the Soviet Union until [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement.

To do so, he believed that a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a socialist economy.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=35}} He defined socialism as \"an order of civilized co-operators in which the [[means of production]] are socially owned\",{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=432}} and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until it could create a [[Post-scarcity economy|society of abundance]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} To achieve this, he saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be his central concern, with\u2014in his words\u2014\"all citizens\" becoming \"hired employees of the state\".{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=42\u201343}} Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and [[statism|statist]], with both production and distribution strictly controlled.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} He believed that all workers throughout the country would voluntarily join together to enable the state's economic and political centralisation.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=38}} In this way, his calls for \"workers' control\" of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by their workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a \"workers' state\".{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=43\u201344, 63}} This resulted in what some perceive as two conflicting themes within Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=36}}\n\n[[File:Lenin 1919-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|Lenin speaking in 1919]]\n\nBefore 1914, Lenin's views were largely in accordance with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=203}} his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=29|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=1}} including those of the Narodnik agrarian-socialists.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=173}} He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=13}} including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=57|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=151}} Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}}\n\nIn his theoretical writings, particularly ''Imperialism'', Lenin discussed what he regarded as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it had reached a new stage: [[state monopoly capitalism]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=34}} He believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, the presence of monopoly capitalism in Russia meant that the country was sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism.{{sfn|White|2001|pp=150\u2013151}} Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its [[Emancipation|liberationist]] vision.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=3}}\n\n===Democracy and the national question===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[Lenin] accepted truth as handed down by Marx and selected data and arguments to bolster that truth.

Ideologically a [[Communism|communist]], he developed a variant of [[Marxism]] known as [[Leninism]].\n\n<!--Early life and revolutionary activity-->\nBorn to a moderately prosperous middle-class family in [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]], Lenin embraced [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] politics following [[Aleksandr Ulyanov|his brother's]] 1887 execution. Expelled from [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]] for participating in protests against the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Tsarist autocracy|Tsarist government]], he devoted the following years to a law degree. He moved to [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1893 and became a senior Marxist activist. In 1897, he was arrested for [[sedition]] and exiled to [[Shushenskoye]] for three years, where he married [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. After his exile, he moved to Western Europe, where he became a prominent theorist in the Marxist [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP). In 1903, he took a key role in a RSDLP ideological split, leading the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik faction]] against [[Julius Martov]]'s [[Mensheviks]]. Encouraging insurrection during Russia's failed [[Revolution of 1905]], he later campaigned for the [[First World War]] to be transformed into a Europe-wide [[proletarian revolution]], which as a Marxist he believed would cause the overthrow of [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] and its replacement with [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]]. After the 1917 [[February Revolution]] ousted the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] and established a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], he returned to Russia to play a leading role in the [[October Revolution]], in which the Bolsheviks overthrew the new regime.\n\n<!--October Revolution and Lenin's government-->\n[[Council of People's Commissars|Lenin's Bolshevik government]] initially shared power with the [[Left Socialist Revolutionaries]], elected [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets|soviets]], and a multi-party [[Russian Constituent Assembly|Constituent Assembly]], although by 1918 it had centralised power in the new Communist Party. Lenin's administration redistributed land among the peasantry and nationalised banks and large-scale industry. It withdrew from the First World War by signing a [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|treaty]] conceding territory to the [[Central Powers]], and promoted [[world revolution]] through the [[Communist International]]. Opponents were suppressed in the [[Red Terror]], a violent campaign administered by the [[Cheka|state security services]]; tens of thousands were killed or interned in concentration camps. His administration defeated [[Right-wing politics|right]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] anti-Bolshevik armies in the [[Russian Civil War]] from 1917 to 1922 and oversaw the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] of 1919\u20131921. Responding to wartime devastation, [[Russian famine of 1921|famine]], and popular uprisings, in 1921 Lenin encouraged economic growth through the market-oriented [[New Economic Policy]]. Several non-Russian nations had secured independence from the Russian Empire after 1917, but three were [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|re-united]] into the new [[Treaty on the Creation of the USSR|Soviet Union]] in 1922. His health failing, Lenin died in [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]], with [[Joseph Stalin]] succeeding him as the pre-eminent figure in the Soviet government.\n\n<!--Reception and legacy-->\nWidely considered one of the most significant and influential figures of the 20th century, Lenin was the posthumous subject of a pervasive [[cult of personality|personality cult]] within the Soviet Union until [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] in 1991. He became an ideological figurehead behind [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] and thus a prominent influence over the international communist movement. A controversial and highly divisive historical figure, Lenin is viewed by supporters as a champion of socialism and the [[working class]], while critics on both the left and right emphasize his role as founder and leader of an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] regime responsible for [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|political repression and mass killings]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{Main|Early life of Vladimir Lenin}}\n\n===Childhood: 1870\u20131887===\n[[File:Dom ulyanovyh.jpg|thumb|Lenin's childhood home in [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]]]]\n\nLenin's father, [[Ilya Ulyanov|Ilya Nikolayevich Ulyanov]], was from a family of [[Serfdom in Russia|serfs]]; his ethnic origins remain unclear, with suggestions being made that he was [[Russians|Russian]], [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], [[Mordvins|Mordvin]], or [[Kalmyks|Kalmyk]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=1\u20132|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12\u201313|3a1=Volkogonov|3y=1994|3p=7|4a1=Service|4y=2000|4pp=21\u201323|5a1=White|5y=2001|5pp=13\u201315|6a1=Read|6y=2005|6p=6}} Despite this lower-class background Ilya had risen to middle-class status, studying physics and mathematics at [[Kazan (Volga region) Federal University|Kazan Imperial University]] before teaching at the [[Institute for Nobles|Penza Institute for the Nobility]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=1\u20132|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2pp=12\u201313|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=21\u201323|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=13\u201315|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=6}} Ilya married [[Maria Alexandrovna Ulyanova|Maria Alexandrovna Blank]] in mid-1863.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1p=5|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=13|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3p=23}} Well educated, she was the daughter of a wealthy [[History of Germans in Russia, Ukraine and the Soviet Union|German]]\u2013[[Swedish diaspora|Swedish]] [[Lutheran]] mother, and a [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] father who had [[Apostasy in Judaism|converted to Christianity]] and worked as a physician.{{sfnm|1a1=Fischer|1y=1964|1pp=2\u20133|2a1=Rice|2y=1990|2p=12|3a1=Service|3y=2000|3pp=16\u201319, 23|4a1=White|4y=2001|4pp=15\u201318|5a1=Read|5y=2005|5p=5|6a1=Lih|6y=2011|6p=20}} It is likely that Lenin was unaware of his mother's half-Jewish ancestry, which was only discovered by his sister Anna after his death.{{sfn|Petrovsky-Shtern|2010|pp=66\u201367}} Soon after their wedding, Ilya obtained a job in [[Nizhny Novgorod]], rising to become Director of Primary Schools in the [[Ulyanovsk|Simbirsk]] district six years later.

To do so, he believed that a \"dictatorship of the proletariat\" was necessary to suppress the bourgeoisie and develop a socialist economy.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=35}} He defined socialism as \"an order of civilized co-operators in which the [[means of production]] are socially owned\",{{sfn|Shub|1966|p=432}} and believed that this economic system had to be expanded until it could create a [[Post-scarcity economy|society of abundance]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} To achieve this, he saw bringing the Russian economy under state control to be his central concern, with\u2014in his words\u2014\"all citizens\" becoming \"hired employees of the state\".{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=42\u201343}} Lenin's interpretation of socialism was centralised, planned, and [[statism|statist]], with both production and distribution strictly controlled.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=41}} He believed that all workers throughout the country would voluntarily join together to enable the state's economic and political centralisation.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=38}} In this way, his calls for \"workers' control\" of the means of production referred not to the direct control of enterprises by their workers, but the operation of all enterprises under the control of a \"workers' state\".{{sfn|Sandle|1999|pp=43\u201344, 63}} This resulted in what some perceive as two conflicting themes within Lenin's thought: popular workers' control, and a centralised, hierarchical, coercive state apparatus.{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=36}}\n\n[[File:Lenin 1919-03-18.jpg|thumb|left|Lenin speaking in 1919]]\n\nBefore 1914, Lenin's views were largely in accordance with mainstream European Marxist orthodoxy.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} Although he derided Marxists who adopted ideas from contemporary non-Marxist philosophers and sociologists,{{sfn|Service|2000|p=203}} his own ideas were influenced not only by Russian Marxist theory but also by wider ideas from the Russian revolutionary movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=29|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=1}} including those of the Narodnik agrarian-socialists.{{sfn|Service|2000|p=173}} He adapted his ideas according to changing circumstances,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=13}} including the pragmatic realities of governing Russia amid war, famine, and economic collapse.{{sfnm|1a1=Sandle|1y=1999|1p=57|2a1=White|2y=2001|2p=151}} Thus, as Leninism developed, Lenin revised the established Marxist orthodoxy and introduced innovations in Marxist thought.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}}\n\nIn his theoretical writings, particularly ''Imperialism'', Lenin discussed what he regarded as developments in capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it had reached a new stage: [[state monopoly capitalism]].{{sfn|Sandle|1999|p=34}} He believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, the presence of monopoly capitalism in Russia meant that the country was sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism.{{sfn|White|2001|pp=150\u2013151}} Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=18}} and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its [[Emancipation|liberationist]] vision.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution,{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=19}} and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.{{sfn|Ryan|2012|p=3}}\n\n===Democracy and the national question===\n\n{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=[Lenin] accepted truth as handed down by Marx and selected data and arguments to bolster that truth.

Raine's estate sold the house to [[Wilmer McLean]] in 1863. It had formerly been a tavern (not to be confused with the nearby [[Clover Hill Tavern]], which Raine had previously owned). One of the first battles of the [[American Civil War]] took place on the farm of Wilmer McLean at [[Bull Run (Occoquan River)|Bull Run, Virginia]], the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (First Battle of Manassas). Soon after that battle the McLeans, seeking to avoid the war, moved to the village of Clover Hill, Virginia (the name of which was changed to \"Appomattox Court House,\" having just become the county seat).  Because of the name of the village, many mistakenly think the surrender was signed in the courthouse building. (In years past, the county seats of many rural counties, especially in Virginia, had names that were simply the name of the county plus \"Court House\"; some of these remain today.<ref name=\"npsMeleanhouse3\">{{cite web|url= http://www.civilwaralbum.com/misc9/appomattox_guide11.htm|title= 1961 Park tour guide brochure|accessdate= 2009-01-21|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100306180829/http://www.civilwaralbum.com/misc9/appomattox_guide11.htm|archive-date= 2010-03-06|url-status= dead}}</ref>  The courthouse is about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}}) from the [[Appomattox Station]] where the trains came into [[Appomattox, Virginia]].<ref name=\"npsMeleanhouse3\"/>\n\nBecause the First Battle of Bull Run, fought on July 21, 1861, took place on Wilmer McLean's farm about {{convert|120|mi|km}} to the north in Virginia, it can be said that the Civil War started in McLean's backyard in 1861 and ended in his parlor in 1865 (although neither event marked the true beginning or ending of hostilities). McLean was a retired [[major]] in the Virginia [[militia]]. He was too old to enlist at the outbreak of the Civil War and decided to move to get away from the Civil War. After the war, he would say of himself that he moved because he loved peace, but he made a small fortune running sugar through the Union blockade. He was also a slave owner, and there are slave quarters next to McLean's house. Nonetheless, in the morning of [[Palm Sunday]] April 9, 1865, the war came back to McLean when General [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered to [[Lieutenant General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] at his home. His house was also used on April 10 for the Surrender Commissioners' meeting, and over the next few days as the headquarters of [[Major General]] [[John Gibbon]] of the [[United States Army]].\n\nThe terms of surrender were: \"The officers to give their individual paroles not to take up arms against the government of the United States until properly exchanged, and each company or regimental commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands,\"... neither \"side arms of the officers nor their private horses or baggage\" to be surrendered; and, as many privates in the Confederate Army owned horses and mules, all horses and mules claimed by men in the Confederate Army to be left in their possession.  The table and chairs used by Lee and Grant when negotiating the surrender are now part of the collections of the [[Chicago History Museum]] and of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]]. After the surrender, many Union soldiers purchased some of McLean's furniture; however, some was stolen.<ref name=\"npsMeleanhouse3\"/> McLean sold pictures of his house after the Civil War; however, he failed financially.<ref name=\"npsMeleanhouse3\"/>\n\nAlthough he had made a considerable fortune smuggling sugar, McLean's money was in Confederate currency, which became worthless with the collapse of the Confederacy, and he was nearly ruined by the end of the war. In the fall of 1867 the McLeans left Appomattox Court House was returned to Mrs. McLean's estate in [[Prince William County, Virginia]]. The banking house of Harrison, Goddin, and Apperson of [[Richmond, Virginia]], obtained a judgment against Wilmer McLean when he defaulted on loans against the property. The house, by then known as the \"Surrender House\", was sold at [[public auction]] on November 29, 1869, and purchased by John L. Pascoe.

The house, now just heaping piles of boards and bricks, sat prey to vandals, collectors, and the environment for fifty years.<ref name=\"npsMeleanhouse1\"/>\n\nAppomattox Court House National Historical Monument was created by Congress on April 10, 1940. It included approximately {{convert|970|acre|ha}} at the [[village]] once known as Clover Hill. The meticulous reconstruction [[archeological]] work began at the site in 1941 amongst overgrown brushes and honeysuckle.

Eighty four years after the historic surrender, reuniting the country, the McLean House was opened by the National Park Service for the first time to the public on April 9, 1949.

Raine's estate sold the house to [[Wilmer McLean]] in 1863. It had formerly been a tavern (not to be confused with the nearby [[Clover Hill Tavern]], which Raine had previously owned). One of the first battles of the [[American Civil War]] took place on the farm of Wilmer McLean at [[Bull Run (Occoquan River)|Bull Run, Virginia]], the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (First Battle of Manassas). Soon after that battle the McLeans, seeking to avoid the war, moved to the village of Clover Hill, Virginia (the name of which was changed to \"Appomattox Court House,\" having just become the county seat).  Because of the name of the village, many mistakenly think the surrender was signed in the courthouse building. (In years past, the county seats of many rural counties, especially in Virginia, had names that were simply the name of the county plus \"Court House\"; some of these remain today.<ref name=\"npsMeleanhouse3\">{{cite web|url= http://www.civilwaralbum.com/misc9/appomattox_guide11.htm|title= 1961 Park tour guide brochure|accessdate= 2009-01-21|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100306180829/http://www.civilwaralbum.com/misc9/appomattox_guide11.htm|archive-date= 2010-03-06|url-status= dead}}</ref>  The courthouse is about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}}) from the [[Appomattox Station]] where the trains came into [[Appomattox, Virginia]].<ref name=\"npsMeleanhouse3\"/>\n\nBecause the First Battle of Bull Run, fought on July 21, 1861, took place on Wilmer McLean's farm about {{convert|120|mi|km}} to the north in Virginia, it can be said that the Civil War started in McLean's backyard in 1861 and ended in his parlor in 1865 (although neither event marked the true beginning or ending of hostilities). McLean was a retired [[major]] in the Virginia [[militia]]. He was too old to enlist at the outbreak of the Civil War and decided to move to get away from the Civil War. After the war, he would say of himself that he moved because he loved peace, but he made a small fortune running sugar through the Union blockade. He was also a slave owner, and there are slave quarters next to McLean's house. Nonetheless, in the morning of [[Palm Sunday]] April 9, 1865, the war came back to McLean when General [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered to [[Lieutenant General]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]] at his home. His house was also used on April 10 for the Surrender Commissioners' meeting, and over the next few days as the headquarters of [[Major General]] [[John Gibbon]] of the [[United States Army]].\n\nThe terms of surrender were: \"The officers to give their individual paroles not to take up arms against the government of the United States until properly exchanged, and each company or regimental commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands,\"... neither \"side arms of the officers nor their private horses or baggage\" to be surrendered; and, as many privates in the Confederate Army owned horses and mules, all horses and mules claimed by men in the Confederate Army to be left in their possession.  The table and chairs used by Lee and Grant when negotiating the surrender are now part of the collections of the [[Chicago History Museum]] and of the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of American History]]. After the surrender, many Union soldiers purchased some of McLean's furniture; however, some was stolen.<ref name=\"npsMeleanhouse3\"/> McLean sold pictures of his house after the Civil War; however, he failed financially.<ref name=\"npsMeleanhouse3\"/>\n\nAlthough he had made a considerable fortune smuggling sugar, McLean's money was in Confederate currency, which became worthless with the collapse of the Confederacy, and he was nearly ruined by the end of the war. In the fall of 1867 the McLeans left Appomattox Court House was returned to Mrs. McLean's estate in [[Prince William County, Virginia]]. The banking house of Harrison, Goddin, and Apperson of [[Richmond, Virginia]], obtained a judgment against Wilmer McLean when he defaulted on loans against the property. The house, by then known as the \"Surrender House\", was sold at [[public auction]] on November 29, 1869, and purchased by John L. Pascoe.

Against the [[Boston Red Sox]] in the [[2008 ALCS]] he hit four home runs and drove in 11. In game 5 of the World Series, Upton stole second base and scored a crucial game tying run moments before the game was suspended due to torrential rain.
