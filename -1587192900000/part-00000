It was also customary for them to wear crowns of foliage when they exercised their functions. And it is certain that the crown, which became and which still remains the emblem of power, was then only a religious symbol, an exterior sign, which accompanied prayer and sacrifice. Amongst the nine archons, the second archon, the one called the King, was the representative of the high priestly function of the old Kings, but each of his colleagues had some priestly duty to fulfill, some sacrifice to offer to the gods. (\"Gustave Ducoudray, ''The history of ancient civilization: a handbook'', 1889 [https://books.google.com/books?id=CQoFAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA129 pg 129])</ref> The six others were the ''[[thesmothetai]]'', judicial officers.  Originally these offices were filled from the wealthier classes by elections every ten years. During this period the eponymous archon was the chief magistrate, the polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the ''archon basileus'' was responsible for some civic religious arrangements, and for the supervision of some major trials in the law courts. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the eponymous archon.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe [[archon]] was the chief [[magistrate]] in many Greek cities, but in [[Athens]] there was a council of archons which exerted a form of executive government. From the late 8th century BC there were three archons: the ''archon eponymos'', the ''[[polemarch]]os'' (originally with a military role, which was transferred to the ten ''[[strategos|strategoi]]'' in 501 BC), and the ''[[archon basileus]]'' (the ceremonial vestige of the [[Kings of Athens|Athenian monarchy]]).<ref>Gods, Heroes and Tyrants: Greek Chronology in Chaos By Emmet John Sweeney.</ref> These positions were filled from the aristocracy (the [[Eupatridae]]) by elections every ten years. During this period Archon Eponymous was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements.\n\nAfter 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the archon eponymous.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The year ran from July to June.<ref>{{cite book | last=Green | first=Peter | year=2009 | chapter=Diodorus Siculus on the Third Sacred War | editor-last=Marincola | editor-first=John | title=A Companion to Greek and Roman Historiography | publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Oxford, United Kingdom |isbn=9780470766286 | page=364 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXSwRG_whNUC&pg=PT434 | volume=2 | series=Blackwell Companions to the Ancient World}}</ref> The archon eponymous was the chief archon, and presided over meetings of the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]] and [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]], the ancient Athenian assemblies. The archon eponymous remained the titular head of state even under the democracy, though with much reduced political importance. Under the reforms of [[Solon]], himself archon eponymous in 594 BC, there was a brief period when the number of archons rose to ten. After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the [[Areopagus]], though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically.\n\nOne of the archons oversaw the procedure for [[ostracism]] after 487 BC.<ref name=Fox122>Fox ''The Classical World'' p. 122</ref> An archon's court was in charge of the ''[[Epikleros|epikleroi]]''.<ref name=Lacey139>Lacey ''The Family in Ancient Greece'' p. 139-145</ref> Other duties of the archons included supervising the [[Panathenaea]] and [[Dionysia]] festivals.<ref name=Adkins35>Adkins ''Handbook to Life in Ancient Greece'' p. 35-36</ref>\n\n==List of archons of Athens==\nIn the following list of Archons, years where the name of the archon is unknown are identified as such. Years listed as \"[[anarchy]]\" mean that there was literally \"no archon\". There are various conflicting reconstructions of lists; sources for this list are given at the end. Note that the term of an archon covered two of our years, beginning in the spring or summer and continuing into the next spring or summer. The polemarch or strategoi, basileus, and thesmothetai (the six assistants to the archons) are also listed, where known.\n\n=== Archaic period ===\n{{main|Archaic Greece}}\n{{see also|Greek Dark Ages|Ancient Greece}}\n\n====Life archons====\nThe later Athenian tradition varies on the exact position of this line; they held archonship for life, sometimes referred to as \"Perpetual Archon\", and exercised the sacral powers of kingship, as did the [[archon basileus]] later. The [[historicity]] of any of this ancient list may be reasonably doubted. [[Aristotle]] indicates that Medon and Acastus may have ruled as king rather than Archon.<ref>Aristotle ''Constitution of Athens'', 3</ref>\n{| border=\"0\" width=777px class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It was also customary for them to wear crowns of foliage when they exercised their functions. And it is certain that the crown, which became and which still remains the emblem of power, was then only a religious symbol, an exterior sign, which accompanied prayer and sacrifice. Amongst the nine archons, the second archon, the one called the King, was the representative of the high priestly function of the old Kings, but each of his colleagues had some priestly duty to fulfill, some sacrifice to offer to the gods.

Originally these offices were filled from the wealthier classes by elections every ten years. During this period the eponymous archon was the chief magistrate, the polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the ''archon basileus'' was responsible for some civic religious arrangements, and for the supervision of some major trials in the law courts. After 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the eponymous archon.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe [[archon]] was the chief [[magistrate]] in many Greek cities, but in [[Athens]] there was a council of archons which exerted a form of executive government. From the late 8th century BC there were three archons: the ''archon eponymos'', the ''[[polemarch]]os'' (originally with a military role, which was transferred to the ten ''[[strategos|strategoi]]'' in 501 BC), and the ''[[archon basileus]]'' (the ceremonial vestige of the [[Kings of Athens|Athenian monarchy]]).<ref>Gods, Heroes and Tyrants: Greek Chronology in Chaos By Emmet John Sweeney.</ref> These positions were filled from the aristocracy (the [[Eupatridae]]) by elections every ten years. During this period Archon Eponymous was the chief magistrate, the Polemarch was the head of the armed forces, and the Archon Basileus was responsible for the civic religious arrangements.\n\nAfter 683 BC the offices were held for only a single year, and the year was named after the archon eponymous.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The year ran from July to June.<ref>{{cite book | last=Green | first=Peter | year=2009 | chapter=Diodorus Siculus on the Third Sacred War | editor-last=Marincola | editor-first=John | title=A Companion to Greek and Roman Historiography | publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location=Oxford, United Kingdom |isbn=9780470766286 | page=364 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HXSwRG_whNUC&pg=PT434 | volume=2 | series=Blackwell Companions to the Ancient World}}</ref> The archon eponymous was the chief archon, and presided over meetings of the [[Boule (ancient Greece)|Boule]] and [[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]], the ancient Athenian assemblies. The archon eponymous remained the titular head of state even under the democracy, though with much reduced political importance. Under the reforms of [[Solon]], himself archon eponymous in 594 BC, there was a brief period when the number of archons rose to ten. After 457 BC ex-archons were automatically enrolled as life members of the [[Areopagus]], though that assembly was no longer extremely important politically.\n\nOne of the archons oversaw the procedure for [[ostracism]] after 487 BC.<ref name=Fox122>Fox ''The Classical World'' p. 122</ref> An archon's court was in charge of the ''[[Epikleros|epikleroi]]''.<ref name=Lacey139>Lacey ''The Family in Ancient Greece'' p. 139-145</ref> Other duties of the archons included supervising the [[Panathenaea]] and [[Dionysia]] festivals.<ref name=Adkins35>Adkins ''Handbook to Life in Ancient Greece'' p. 35-36</ref>\n\n==List of archons of Athens==\nIn the following list of Archons, years where the name of the archon is unknown are identified as such. Years listed as \"[[anarchy]]\" mean that there was literally \"no archon\". There are various conflicting reconstructions of lists; sources for this list are given at the end. Note that the term of an archon covered two of our years, beginning in the spring or summer and continuing into the next spring or summer. The polemarch or strategoi, basileus, and thesmothetai (the six assistants to the archons) are also listed, where known.\n\n=== Archaic period ===\n{{main|Archaic Greece}}\n{{see also|Greek Dark Ages|Ancient Greece}}\n\n====Life archons====\nThe later Athenian tradition varies on the exact position of this line; they held archonship for life, sometimes referred to as \"Perpetual Archon\", and exercised the sacral powers of kingship, as did the [[archon basileus]] later. The [[historicity]] of any of this ancient list may be reasonably doubted.

More generally, it is argued that since it is not possible to attach an emotional response to stimuli that cannot be recognized, emotions cannot exist independently of cognition that can recognize. The claim that precise recognition exists as specific attention to some details in a [[modularity of mind|modular mind]] is criticized both with regard to data loss as a small system of disambiguating synapses in a module physically cannot make as precise distinctions as a [[interferometry|bigger synaptic system]] encompassing the whole brain, and for energy loss as having one system for motivation that needs some built-in cognition to recognize anything anyway and another cognitive system for making strategies would cost more energy than integrating it all in one system that use the same synapses. Data losses inherent in all information transfer from more precise systems to less precise systems are also argued to make it impossible for any imprecise system to use a more precise system as an \"emissary\", as a less precise system would not be able to tell whether the outdata from the more precise system was in the interest of the less precise system or not. <ref>A.

In Jainism and Hinduism, this is closely related to the concept of [[ahimsa]], nonviolence toward other beings. In Jainism, all matter is endowed with sentience; there are five degrees of sentience, from one to five.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Water, for example, is a sentient being of the first order, as it is considered to possess only one sense, that of touch. Man is considered a sentient being of the fifth order. According to Buddhism, sentient beings made of pure consciousness are possible. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, which includes [[Zen]] and [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the concept is related to the [[Bodhisattva]], an enlightened being devoted to the liberation of others. The first [[Bodhisattva vows|vow]] of a Bodhisattva states: \"Sentient beings are numberless; I vow to free them.\"\n\n[[Sentient beings (Buddhism)|Sentience in Buddhism]] is the state of having senses. In Buddhism, there are six senses, the sixth being the subjective experience of the mind. Sentience is simply awareness prior to the arising of [[Skandha]].

Because many of the suggested distinguishing features of humanity\u2014extreme intelligence; highly complex language; etc.\u2014are not present in marginal cases such as mute humans, young children, deaf humans, and mentally disabled humans, it appears that the only distinction is a prejudice based on species alone, which animal-rights supporters call [[speciesism]]\u2014that is, differentiating humans from other animals purely on the grounds that they are human. His opponents accuse him of the same petitio principii.\n\n[[Gary Francione]] also bases his [[abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist]] theory of animal rights, which differs significantly from Singer's, on sentience. He asserts that, \"All sentient beings, humans or nonhuman, have one right: the basic right not to be treated as the property of others.\"<ref>Francione, Gary.

The Interfaith Association of [[Animal Chaplain]]s encourages animal ministry groups to adopt a policy of recognising and valuing sentient beings.\n\nIn 1997 the concept of [[Animal Sentience (journal)|animal sentience]] was written into the basic law of the European Union. The legally binding protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises that animals are \"sentient beings\", and requires the EU and its member states to \"pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals\".\n\nThe laws of several states include certain invertebrates such as cephalopods (octopuses, squids) and decapod crustaceans (lobsters, crabs) in the scope of animal protection laws, implying that these animals are also judged capable of [[Pain in invertebrates|experiencing pain]] and suffering.<ref>[http://ciwf.org.uk/animal_sentience/policy_and_culture/default.aspx Science, policy and cultural implications of animal sentience, Compassion in World Farming]</ref><ref>These animals are mentioned explicitly in the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness as sentient beings.

Because many of the suggested distinguishing features of humanity\u2014extreme intelligence; highly complex language; etc.\u2014are not present in marginal cases such as mute humans, young children, deaf humans, and mentally disabled humans, it appears that the only distinction is a prejudice based on species alone, which animal-rights supporters call [[speciesism]]\u2014that is, differentiating humans from other animals purely on the grounds that they are human. His opponents accuse him of the same petitio principii.\n\n[[Gary Francione]] also bases his [[abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist]] theory of animal rights, which differs significantly from Singer's, on sentience. He asserts that, \"All sentient beings, humans or nonhuman, have one right: the basic right not to be treated as the property of others.\"<ref>Francione, Gary.

The Interfaith Association of [[Animal Chaplain]]s encourages animal ministry groups to adopt a policy of recognising and valuing sentient beings.\n\nIn 1997 the concept of [[Animal Sentience (journal)|animal sentience]] was written into the basic law of the European Union. The legally binding protocol annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam recognises that animals are \"sentient beings\", and requires the EU and its member states to \"pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals\".\n\nThe laws of several states include certain invertebrates such as cephalopods (octopuses, squids) and decapod crustaceans (lobsters, crabs) in the scope of animal protection laws, implying that these animals are also judged capable of [[Pain in invertebrates|experiencing pain]] and suffering.<ref>[http://ciwf.org.uk/animal_sentience/policy_and_culture/default.aspx Science, policy and cultural implications of animal sentience, Compassion in World Farming]</ref><ref>These animals are mentioned explicitly in the Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness as sentient beings.
