During normal conditions, there was no discussion of estimating and building up stockpiles for use in emergencies.<ref name=\"play5\" /> The plan and guidelines were public.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

The models can incorporate mitigation measures, seasonality, randomness, and other factors that can vary during a real epidemic. Similar tests are used by the insurance industry to understand risks posed by infrequent natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe Trump administration simulated a series of pandemic outbreaks from China in 2019 and found that the U.S. government response was \"underfunded, underprepared, and uncoordinated\" (see [[Crimson Contagion]]).<ref name= simulation2019>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/trump-let-u-fall-behind-120054883.html|title=How Trump let the U.S. fall behind the curve on coronavirus threat|website=news.yahoo.com}}</ref> Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported. It led President Trump to issue an executive order to make flu vaccines more readily available and of higher quality, and he provided additional funds for the pandemic threats program in the Department of Health and Human Services ([[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]]).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Before Virus Outbreak, a Cascade of Warnings Went Unheeded|date=March 19, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 20, 2020|last2=Lipton|first2=Eric|issn=0362-4331|last3=Sullivan|first3=Eileen|last4=Crowley|first4=Michael}}</ref> White House economists published a study in September 2019 that warned a pandemic could kill half a million Americans and devastate the economy.<ref>''[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/coronavirus-economy-trump.html White House Economists Warned in 2019 a Pandemic Could Devastate America]'' March 31, 2020 New York Times</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the WHO also ran a simulation exercise of a global pandemic response involving more than 40 countries, although the results appear to be unavailable.<ref>[https://www.who.int/ihr/eoc-exercise/en/ \"Simulation exercise puts global pandemic readiness to the test\"], World Health Organization, Dec. 3, 2018</ref>\n\n=== Potential response strategies ===\n\nIn 2016, the NSC laid out pandemic strategies and recommendations including, moving swiftly to fully detect potential outbreaks, securing supplemental funding, considering invoking the [[Defense Production Act of 1950|Defense Production Act]], and ensuring sufficient protective equipment available for healthcare workers.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

The Editorial Board of the ''Wall Street Journal'', is among those who feel the world would have been \"better prepared\" had the WHO declared a \"Public Health Emergency\" weeks before it did, since the virus had by then spread to other countries and had already taken on the attributes of a pandemic.<ref name=wsj-info /> Brazil's Health Minister likewise felt the WHO was too slow in declaring the global coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, which it did six weeks later, thereby complicating Brazil's ability to fully prepare for and curb the spread of the virus after it arrived.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-11/who-s-pandemic-declaration-came-too-late-brazil-says \"WHO's Pandemic Declaration Came Too Late, Brazil Says\"], 'Bloomberg'', March 11, 2020</ref> By the time it was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the virus had already spread across all continents except Antarctica, to 110 countries, leaving less time for some countries to fully prepare their emergency health organizations.<ref>[https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/3/9/21163412/who-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic-world-health-organization \"Why the WHO waited to call the coronavirus a pandemic\"], ''Vox'', March 11, 2020</ref><ref>[https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/how-coronavirus-could-become-pandemic-and-why-it-matters/#close \"Coronavirus is officially a pandemic.

New York City, for instance, took preparatory steps more than a decade ago, but then discontinued them in favor of other priorities.<ref>[https://nypost.com/2020/04/07/nycs-pandemic-preparations-that-started-and-stopped/ \"NYC's pandemic preparations that started\u2014and stopped\"], ''New York Post'', April 7, 2020</ref>\n\nWith the current pandemic, once cases began spreading throughout the nation, federal and state agencies began taking urgent steps to prepare for a surge of hospital patients. Among the actions was establishing additional places for patients in case hospitals became overwhelmed. That included transforming buildings normally used for sports and entertainment events by turning them into field hospitals. The [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], for instance, was cancelled and the fairgrounds where it is normally held was turned into a medical center.<ref>[https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2020-03-30/coronavirus-event-companies-coachella-pivot-covid-19-testing \"They were supposed to build stages for Coachella.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n=== Containment and mitigation ===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI />\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI />\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] ability, i.e. endurance or strength. A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practising only one, such as only cardio/respiratory endurance or only weight training.\n\nA comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills,<ref>{{cite web|title=Skill-related physical fitness essential for sports success|url=http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617084150/http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archive-date=June 2011|work=tradoc.army.mil|date=19 January 2004| last = Colfer | first = George R. | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> and on age-<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nied RJ, Franklin B | title = Promoting and prescribing exercise for the elderly | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 419\u201326 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11858624 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0201/p419.html }}</ref> or health-related needs such as bone health.<ref>[http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Exercise/default.asp \"Exercise for Your Bone Health\"]. nih.gov.</ref>  Many sources<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4177.0 | title = Participation in Sport and Physical Recreation, Australia | date = 18 February 2015    | publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics }}</ref> also cite [[mental health|mental]], [[social health|social]] and [[emotional health]] as an important part of overall fitness.

This publication recommends  that all adults should avoid inactivity to promote good health mentally and physically. For substantial health benefits, adults should participate in at least 150 minutes  a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the week.\n\nNew (July 2011) guidelines in the United Kingdom include the following points:\nThe intensity at which we exercise is key, and light activity such as strolling and housework is unlikely to have much positive impact on the health of most people. For aerobic exercise to be beneficial, it must raise the [[heart rate]] and cause [[perspiration]]. Everyone should do a minimum of 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, but that really is the minimum for health benefits. If you do so beyond 150 minutes, you will gain even more health benefits.\nSedentary time (time spent not standing, such as on when on the toilet or in bed) is bad for everyone's health, and no amount of exercise can negate the effects of sitting for too long.\nThese guidelines are now much more in line with those used in the US, which also includes recommendations for muscle-building and bone-strengthening activities such as lifting weights and yoga.<https://www.nhs.uk/news/lifestyle-and-exercise/major-new-exercise-guidelines-announced/>\n\nThe US guidelines continue: For additional and more extensive health benefits, adults should increase their aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount. Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/paguide.pdf/ | title = Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans | publisher = Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion | date = 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Exercise ==\n{{Main|Exercise}}\n\n=== Aerobic exercise ===\n{{Main|Aerobic exercise}}\n[[Cardiorespiratory fitness]] can be measured using [[VO2 max]], a measure of the amount of oxygen the body can uptake and utilize.<ref name=\"r27\" /><ref name=\"pmid23025219\">{{cite journal | authors = Chakravertty B, Parkavi K, Coumary SA, Felix AJ | title = Antepartum cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) quantification by estimation of maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2 max) in pregnant South Indian women | journal = Journal of the Indian Medical Association | volume = 110 | issue = 4 | pages = 214\u20137 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 23025219 | doi =  }}</ref> Aerobic exercise, which improves cardiorespiratory fitness, involves movement that increases the heart rate to improve the body's oxygen consumption.

Also, it helps increase stamina.\n[[File:Female jogger with good tan jogging - Scenes from Morro Bay, CA.jpg|thumb|200px|A woman jogging at a beach in the U.S. to maintain/improve her physical fitness]]\n\nExamples are:\n\n*[[Jogging]] \u2013  Running at a steady and gentle pace. This form of exercise is great for maintaining weight.\n* Elliptical training \u2013 This is a stationary [[exercise machine]] used to perform [[walking]], or [[running]] without causing excessive stress on the joints. This form of exercise is perfect for people with achy hips, knees, and ankles.\n*[[Walking]] \u2013 Moving at a fairly regular pace for a short, medium or long distance.\n*[[Treadmill]] training \u2013 Many treadmills have programs set up that offer numerous different workout plans. One effective cardiovascular activity would be to switch between running and walking. Typically warm up first by walking and then switch off between walking for three minutes and running for three minutes.\n*[[Human swimming|Swimming]] \u2013 Using the arms and legs to keep oneself afloat and moving either forwards or backward. This is a good full-body exercise for those who are looking to strengthen their core while improving cardiovascular endurance.\n*[[Cycling]] \u2013 Riding a bicycle typically involves longer distances than walking or jogging. This is another low-stress exercise on the joints and is great for improving leg strength.<ref name=\"r29\" />\n\n=== Anaerobic exercise ===\n{{Main|Anaerobic exercise}}\n\nAnaerobic exercise features high-intensity movements performed in a short period of time. It is a fast, high-intensity exercise that doesn\u2019t require the body to utilize oxygen as its energy source. It helps to promote strength, endurance, speed, and power; and is used by bodybuilders to build workout intensity. Thought to increase the metabolic rate which, allows to burn fat after the exercise ended. \n\nExamples are: \n\n* Weight lifting - A common type of [[strength training]] for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles. \n*[[Isometrics]] - Helps to maintain strength. The contractions of a particular muscle or group of muscles. \n*[[Sprinting]] - Running short distances as fast as possible\n* Interval training - alternating short bursts (lasting around 30 seconds) of intense activity with longer intervals (three to four minutes) of less intense activity.\n\n== Training ==\n{{anchor|PT}}\n\nSpecific or task-oriented fitness is a person's ability to perform in a specific activity with a reasonable efficiency: for example, sports or [[military service]]. Specific training prepares athletes to perform well in their sport.\n\nExamples are:\n* [[100 m sprint]]: in a sprint, the athlete must be trained to work anaerobically throughout the race, an example of how to do this would be interval training.\n* [[Century ride|Century Ride]]: cyclists must be prepared aerobically for a bike ride of 100 miles or more.\n* [[Middle distance running]]: athletes require both speed and endurance to gain benefit out of this training.

Exercise with the correct amount of intensity, duration, and frequency can produce a significant amount of improvement. The person may overall feel better, but the physical effects on the human body take weeks or months to notice and possibly years for full development. For training purposes, exercise must provide a stress or demand on either a function or tissue. To continue improvements, this demand must eventually increase little over an extended period of time. This sort of exercise training has three basic principles: overload, specificity, and progression.  These principles are related to health but also enhancement of physical working capacity.<ref name= Blair>{{cite journal | authors = Blair SN | title = 1993 C.H.

The large associations tied with being physically fit and reduced cancer risk are enough to provide a strategy to reduce cancer risk.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\nThe American Cancer Society asserts different levels of activity ranging from moderate to vigorous to clarify the recommended time spent on a physical activity. These classifications of physical activity consider the intentional exercise and basic activities are done on a daily basis and give the public a greater understanding of what fitness levels suffice as future disease prevention.\n\n=== Inflammation ===\nStudies have shown an association between increased physical activity and reduced inflammation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Colbert LH, Visser M, Simonsick EM, Tracy RP, Newman AB, Kritchevsky SB, Pahor M, Taaffe DR, Brach J, Rubin S, Harris TB | title = Physical activity, exercise, and inflammatory markers in older adults: findings from the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study | journal = Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | volume = 52 | issue = 7 | pages = 1098\u2013104 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15209647 | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2004.52307.x }}</ref> It produces both a short-term inflammatory response and a long-term anti-inflammatory effect.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kasapis C, Thompson PD | title = The effects of physical activity on serum C-reactive protein and inflammatory markers: a systematic review | journal = Journal of the American College of Cardiology | volume = 45 | issue = 10 | pages = 1563\u20139 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15893167 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2004.12.077 }}</ref> Physical activity reduces inflammation in conjunction with or independent of changes in body weight.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Campbell KL, McTiernan A | title = Exercise and biomarkers for cancer prevention studies | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 137 | issue = 1 Suppl | pages = 161S\u2013169S | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17182820 | doi = 10.1093/jn/137.1.161S | doi-access = free }}</ref> However, the mechanisms linking physical activity to inflammation are unknown.\n\n=== Immune system ===\nPhysical activity boosts the [[immune system]].

Individuals who keep up physical fitness levels generally regulate their distribution of body fat and stay away from obesity. Abdominal fat, specifically visceral fat, is most directly affected by engaging in aerobic exercise. Strength training has been known to increase the amount of muscle in the body, however, it can also reduce body fat.<ref name=r28/> Sex steroid hormones, insulin, and an appropriate immune response are factors that mediate metabolism in relation to the abdominal fat. Therefore, physical fitness provides weight control through regulation of these bodily functions.<ref>{{cite journal | authors = Westerlind KC | title = Physical activity and cancer prevention--mechanisms | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 35 | issue = 11 | pages = 1834\u201340 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14600547 | doi = 10.1249/01.MSS.0000093619.37805.B7 }}</ref>\n\n=== Menopause and physical fitness ===\n[[Menopause]] is often said to have occurred when a woman has had no vaginal bleeding for over a year since her last [[menstrual cycle]]. There are a number of symptoms connected to menopause, most of which can affect the quality of life of a woman involved in this stage of her life. One way to reduce the severity of the symptoms is to exercise and keep a healthy level of fitness.  Prior to and during menopause, as the female body changes, there can be physical, physiological or internal changes to the body. These changes can be reduced or even prevented with regular exercising. These changes include:<ref>{{cite journal | authors = Sternfeld B, Dugan S | title = Physical activity and health during the menopausal transition | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 537\u201366 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21961719 | pmc = 3270074 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2011.05.008 }}</ref>\n\n* Preventing weight gain: around menopause women tend to experience a reduction in muscle mass and an increase in fat levels.

Granger Collection.jpg|thumb|Ladies performing a common 19th century fitness routine including climbing the underside of a ladder, balancing and gymnastics.]]\nPhysical fitness has always been an important part of life. It is theorized that when people left a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and formed fixed communities based around agriculture that physical fitness levels declined.  This is not to say that levels of physical labor decreased but that the type of work undertaken was not necessarily as conducive to a general level of fitness. As such, regimented fitness regimes were either invented or became more common. This was especially the case in classical civilizations such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Rome]]. In Greece especially physical fitness was considered to be an essential component of a healthy life and it was the norm for men to frequent a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]. Physical fitness regimes were also considered to be of paramount importance in a nation's ability to train soldiers and field an effective military force. Partly for these reasons, organized fitness regimes have been in existence throughout known history and evidence of them can be found in many countries.\n\nGymnasiums which would seem familiar today began to become increasingly common in the 19th century. The industrial revolution had led to a more sedentary lifestyle for many people and there was an increased awareness that this had the potential to be harmful for health. This was a key motivating factor for the forming of a [[physical culture]] movement, especially in Europe and the USA. This movement advocated increased levels of physical fitness for men, women and children and sought to do so through various forms of indoor and outdoor activity, and education. In many ways it laid the foundations for modern fitness culture.<ref>https://exercise.lovetoknow.com/Physical_Fitness_History</ref>\n\n== Education ==\n{{See also|Physical education}}\n* [[American Council on Exercise]] (ACE)\n* [[National Academy of Sports Medicine]] (NASM)\n* [[International Sports Sciences Association|International Sports Science Association]] (ISSA)\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[20th century women's fitness culture]]\n*[[Bodybuilding]]\n* [[Fitness fashion]]\n* [[Fitness professional]]\n* [[Health]]\n* [[Health club]]\n* [[Outline of exercise]]\n* [[Personal trainer]]\n* [[Physical exercise]]\n* [[Power training]]\n* [[Strength training]]\n* [[Weight training]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em|refs =\n<ref name=r27>{{cite journal | vauthors = Haskell WL, Troiano RP, Hammond JA, Phillips MJ, Strader LC, Marquez DX, Grant SF, Ramos E | title = Physical activity and physical fitness: standardizing assessment with the PhenX Toolkit | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 486\u201392 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22516489 | pmc = 3331998 | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2011.11.017 }}</ref>\n<ref name=r28>{{cite journal| vauthors = Westcott WL, La Rosa Loud R|year= 2014|title=Strength for fat loss training |journal=American Fitness|volume=32|issue=1|pages=18\u201322}}</ref>\n<ref name=r29>{{cite journal | vauthors = Osawa Y, Azuma K, Tabata S, Katsukawa F, Ishida H, Oguma Y, Kawai T, Itoh H, Okuda S, Matsumoto H | title = Effects of 16-week high-intensity interval training using upper and lower body ergometers on aerobic fitness and morphological changes in healthy men: a preliminary study | journal = Open Access Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 5 | pages = 257\u201365 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25395872 | pmc = 4226445 | doi = 10.2147/OAJSM.S68932 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Commons category|Fitness}}\n{{Wikiversity}}\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web | date = September 2004 | work =  Medical News Today | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/13772.php | title = The Benefits of Physical Activity }}\n* {{cite book | last=Brandon | first=Leigh | name-list-format = vanc | title=Anatomy of Strength and Fitness Training for Speed | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-07-163363-5 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Physical exercise|state=expanded}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em|}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Physical Fitness}}\n[[Category:Physical exercise]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|State of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2015}}\n[[File:USMC-Rich Froning Jr.jpg|thumb|Physical fitness is generally achieved through [[physical exercise|exercise]].

This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant [[aerobic exercise|aerobic]] or [[anaerobic exercise|anaerobic]] ability, i.e. endurance or strength. A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practising only one, such as only cardio/respiratory endurance or only weight training.\n\nA comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills,<ref>{{cite web|title=Skill-related physical fitness essential for sports success|url=http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617084150/http://www.tradoc.army.mil/pao/Web_specials/H_and_PWB/013204.htm|archive-date=June 2011|work=tradoc.army.mil|date=19 January 2004| last = Colfer | first = George R. | name-list-format = vanc }}</ref> and on age-<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nied RJ, Franklin B | title = Promoting and prescribing exercise for the elderly | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 65 | issue = 3 | pages = 419\u201326 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11858624 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2002/0201/p419.html }}</ref> or health-related needs such as bone health.<ref>[http://www.niams.nih.gov/Health_Info/Bone/Bone_Health/Exercise/default.asp \"Exercise for Your Bone Health\"]. nih.gov.</ref>  Many sources<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4177.0 | title = Participation in Sport and Physical Recreation, Australia | date = 18 February 2015    | publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics }}</ref> also cite [[mental health|mental]], [[social health|social]] and [[emotional health]] as an important part of overall fitness.

This publication recommends  that all adults should avoid inactivity to promote good health mentally and physically. For substantial health benefits, adults should participate in at least 150 minutes  a week of moderate-intensity, or 75 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. Aerobic activity should be performed in episodes of at least 10 minutes, and preferably, it should be spread throughout the week.\n\nNew (July 2011) guidelines in the United Kingdom include the following points:\nThe intensity at which we exercise is key, and light activity such as strolling and housework is unlikely to have much positive impact on the health of most people. For aerobic exercise to be beneficial, it must raise the [[heart rate]] and cause [[perspiration]]. Everyone should do a minimum of 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise, but that really is the minimum for health benefits. If you do so beyond 150 minutes, you will gain even more health benefits.\nSedentary time (time spent not standing, such as on when on the toilet or in bed) is bad for everyone's health, and no amount of exercise can negate the effects of sitting for too long.\nThese guidelines are now much more in line with those used in the US, which also includes recommendations for muscle-building and bone-strengthening activities such as lifting weights and yoga.<https://www.nhs.uk/news/lifestyle-and-exercise/major-new-exercise-guidelines-announced/>\n\nThe US guidelines continue: For additional and more extensive health benefits, adults should increase their aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes (5 hours) a week of moderate-intensity, or 150 minutes a week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. Additional health benefits are gained by engaging in physical activity beyond this amount. Adults should also do muscle-strengthening activities that are moderate or high intensity and involve all major muscle groups on 2 or more days a week, as these activities provide additional health benefits.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/paguide.pdf/ | title = Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans | publisher = Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion | date = 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Exercise ==\n{{Main|Exercise}}\n\n=== Aerobic exercise ===\n{{Main|Aerobic exercise}}\n[[Cardiorespiratory fitness]] can be measured using [[VO2 max]], a measure of the amount of oxygen the body can uptake and utilize.<ref name=\"r27\" /><ref name=\"pmid23025219\">{{cite journal | authors = Chakravertty B, Parkavi K, Coumary SA, Felix AJ | title = Antepartum cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) quantification by estimation of maximal oxygen consumption (Vo2 max) in pregnant South Indian women | journal = Journal of the Indian Medical Association | volume = 110 | issue = 4 | pages = 214\u20137 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 23025219 | doi =  }}</ref> Aerobic exercise, which improves cardiorespiratory fitness, involves movement that increases the heart rate to improve the body's oxygen consumption.

The contractions of a particular muscle or group of muscles. \n*[[Sprinting]] - Running short distances as fast as possible\n* Interval training - alternating short bursts (lasting around 30 seconds) of intense activity with longer intervals (three to four minutes) of less intense activity.\n\n== Training ==\n{{anchor|PT}}\n\nSpecific or task-oriented fitness is a person's ability to perform in a specific activity with a reasonable efficiency: for example, sports or [[military service]]. Specific training prepares athletes to perform well in their sport.\n\nExamples are:\n* [[100 m sprint]]: in a sprint, the athlete must be trained to work anaerobically throughout the race, an example of how to do this would be interval training.\n* [[Century ride|Century Ride]]: cyclists must be prepared aerobically for a bike ride of 100 miles or more.\n* [[Middle distance running]]: athletes require both speed and endurance to gain benefit out of this training.

Exercise with the correct amount of intensity, duration, and frequency can produce a significant amount of improvement. The person may overall feel better, but the physical effects on the human body take weeks or months to notice and possibly years for full development. For training purposes, exercise must provide a stress or demand on either a function or tissue. To continue improvements, this demand must eventually increase little over an extended period of time. This sort of exercise training has three basic principles: overload, specificity, and progression.  These principles are related to health but also enhancement of physical working capacity.<ref name= Blair>{{cite journal | authors = Blair SN | title = 1993 C.H.

The heart is the main organ in charge of [[systolic|systolic blood pressure]] and [[diastolic blood pressure]]. Engaging in a physical activity raises blood pressure. Once the subject stops the activity, the blood pressure returns to normal.

The WCRF/ [[American Institute for Cancer Research]]  (AICR) published a list of recommendations that reflect the evidence they have found through consistency in fitness and dietary factors that directly relate to cancer prevention.\n\nThe WCRF/AICR recommendations include the following: \n* Be as lean as possible without becoming underweight.\n* Each week, adults should engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity.\n* Children should engage in at least one hour of moderate or vigorous physical activity each week.\n* Be physically active for at least thirty minutes every day.\n* Avoid [[sugar]], and limit the consumption of energy packed foods.\n* Balance one's diet with a variety of vegetables, grains, fruits, legumes, etc.\n* Limit [[sodium]] intake, the consumption of red meats and the consumption of processed meats.\n* Limit alcoholic drinks to two for men and one for women a day.<ref name=\"auto\">Alberts, David S. and Hess, Lisa M.

Granger Collection.jpg|thumb|Ladies performing a common 19th century fitness routine including climbing the underside of a ladder, balancing and gymnastics.]]\nPhysical fitness has always been an important part of life. It is theorized that when people left a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and formed fixed communities based around agriculture that physical fitness levels declined.  This is not to say that levels of physical labor decreased but that the type of work undertaken was not necessarily as conducive to a general level of fitness. As such, regimented fitness regimes were either invented or became more common. This was especially the case in classical civilizations such as [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Rome]]. In Greece especially physical fitness was considered to be an essential component of a healthy life and it was the norm for men to frequent a [[Gymnasium (ancient Greece)|gymnasium]]. Physical fitness regimes were also considered to be of paramount importance in a nation's ability to train soldiers and field an effective military force. Partly for these reasons, organized fitness regimes have been in existence throughout known history and evidence of them can be found in many countries.\n\nGymnasiums which would seem familiar today began to become increasingly common in the 19th century. The industrial revolution had led to a more sedentary lifestyle for many people and there was an increased awareness that this had the potential to be harmful for health. This was a key motivating factor for the forming of a [[physical culture]] movement, especially in Europe and the USA. This movement advocated increased levels of physical fitness for men, women and children and sought to do so through various forms of indoor and outdoor activity, and education. In many ways it laid the foundations for modern fitness culture.<ref>https://exercise.lovetoknow.com/Physical_Fitness_History</ref>\n\n== Education ==\n{{See also|Physical education}}\n* [[American Council on Exercise]] (ACE)\n* [[National Academy of Sports Medicine]] (NASM)\n* [[International Sports Sciences Association|International Sports Science Association]] (ISSA)\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[20th century women's fitness culture]]\n*[[Bodybuilding]]\n* [[Fitness fashion]]\n* [[Fitness professional]]\n* [[Health]]\n* [[Health club]]\n* [[Outline of exercise]]\n* [[Personal trainer]]\n* [[Physical exercise]]\n* [[Power training]]\n* [[Strength training]]\n* [[Weight training]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|32em|refs =\n<ref name=r27>{{cite journal | vauthors = Haskell WL, Troiano RP, Hammond JA, Phillips MJ, Strader LC, Marquez DX, Grant SF, Ramos E | title = Physical activity and physical fitness: standardizing assessment with the PhenX Toolkit | journal = American Journal of Preventive Medicine | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 486\u201392 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22516489 | pmc = 3331998 | doi = 10.1016/j.amepre.2011.11.017 }}</ref>\n<ref name=r28>{{cite journal| vauthors = Westcott WL, La Rosa Loud R|year= 2014|title=Strength for fat loss training |journal=American Fitness|volume=32|issue=1|pages=18\u201322}}</ref>\n<ref name=r29>{{cite journal | vauthors = Osawa Y, Azuma K, Tabata S, Katsukawa F, Ishida H, Oguma Y, Kawai T, Itoh H, Okuda S, Matsumoto H | title = Effects of 16-week high-intensity interval training using upper and lower body ergometers on aerobic fitness and morphological changes in healthy men: a preliminary study | journal = Open Access Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 5 | pages = 257\u201365 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25395872 | pmc = 4226445 | doi = 10.2147/OAJSM.S68932 }}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Commons category|Fitness}}\n{{Wikiversity}}\n{{Wikivoyage}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web | date = September 2004 | work =  Medical News Today | url = http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/releases/13772.php | title = The Benefits of Physical Activity }}\n* {{cite book | last=Brandon | first=Leigh | name-list-format = vanc | title=Anatomy of Strength and Fitness Training for Speed | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-07-163363-5 }}\n{{refend}}\n\n{{Physical exercise|state=expanded}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=18em|}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Physical Fitness}}\n[[Category:Physical exercise]]\n", "name_user": "61.6.236.197", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness"}

While slowly climbing through 8,000 feet at 85 percent engine power the jet banked slightly to the right and impacted the left side of the airliner forward of the wing. The airliner pitched up, its air speed decreasing, then the nose dropped and the aircraft entered a steep spin to the right, slowing to a flat spin before it struck the ground.

Powered by [[Rolls-Royce Dart|Rolls-Royce Dart RDa3 Mark 506]] engines turning four blade square tipped [[constant-speed propeller|constant-speed propellers]], it was delivered to Capital Airlines on 15 January, 1956 as fleet number 329.<ref name=bae/>\n\nThe pilot in command of Flight 300 was Captain Kendall Brady, age 38. He had a valid airman certificate and was rated to fly single/multi-engine land aircraft as well as the Douglas DC-3, DC-4 and the Vickers Viscount. Brady's total flying hours were 12,719 with 1,432 of those in the Viscount. He was hired by Capital Airlines on 11 June, 1945.<ref name=bae/>\n\nPaul Meyer, age 26, served as co-pilot and started flying for Capital Airlines on 25 May, 1956. He was certified to operate single/multi-engine land aircraft and had an instrument rating.

He was rated as a military pilot August 4, 1944 and joined the Maryland Air National Guard in 1952. He had a total of 1,902 hours in single- and multi-engine and single-engine jet aircraft 210 were in the T-33.<ref name=bae/>\n\n==Investigation==\nThe [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB) investigated the accident and released a report on January 9, 1959. It detrimined that the collision happened during [[visual flight rules|VFR]] conditions and that both aircraft would have been in clear cloud free air nine-tenths of the time. The report noted that it is the overtaking aircraft's responsibility to see and avoid a collision. A contributing factor in the accident was that the small size of the T-33 made it difficult to pick up on radar. The board attributed no blame to the Viscount crew and stated in conclusion that \"The Board determines the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the T-33 pilot to exercise a proper and adequate vigilance to see and avoid other traffic.\"<ref name=bae/>\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Eastern Air Lines Flight 45]]\n*[[1958 in aviation]]\n*[[List of accidents and incidents on commercial aircraft]]\n*[[Mid-air collision]] - includes a list of other notable mid-air collisions.\n\n{{Portal|Aviation}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Aviation accidents and incidents in 1958}}\n\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1958]]\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving mid-air collisions]]\n[[Category:Mid-air collisions]]\n[[Category:May 1958 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1958 aviation accident}}\n{{Infobox Aircraft accident\n|name = Capital Airlines Flight 300 \n|image = Capital Airlines Flight 300 (2).jpg\n|caption = Forward section of the Vickers Viscount\n|date = {{start-date|May 20, 1958}}\n|type = [[Mid-air collision]]\n|occurrence_type = Accident\n|site = Four miles east-northeast of [[Brunswick, Maryland]] \n|coords = {{coord|39|18|39.71|N|77|37|7.95|W|region:US-MD_type:event|display=inline,title}}\n|total_injuries = 1\n|total_fatalities = 12\n|total_survivors = 1 \n|plane1_image = G-arir.jpg\n|plane1_caption = A Vickers Viscount similar to the one involved in the incident.\n|plane1_type = [[Vickers Viscount]]\n|plane1_name =\n|plane1_operator = Capital Airlines \n|plane1_tailnum = [https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19580520-1 N7410]\n|plane1_passengers = 7\n|plane1_crew = 4\n|plane1_survivors = 0\n|plane2_image = Lockheed NT-33A USAF.jpg\n|plane2_caption = A T-33 Shooting Star similar to the one involved in the incident.\n|plane2_type = [[Lockheed T-33]]\n|plane2_name =\n|plane2_operator = USAF Maryland Air National Guard\n|plane2_tailnum = [http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=189007 53-5966]\n|plane2_passengers = \n|plane2_crew = 2\n|plane2_survivors = 1\n}}\nOn May 20, 1958 a [[Vickers Viscount]] airliner operating '''Capital Airlines Flight 300''' was involved in a [[mid air collision]] with a USAF [[T-33]] [[Trainer (aircraft)|jet trainer]] on a proficiency flight in the skies above [[Brunswick, Maryland]].

While slowly climbing through 8,000 feet at 85 percent engine power the jet banked slightly to the right and impacted the left side of the airliner forward of the wing. The airliner pitched up, its air speed decreasing, then the nose dropped and the aircraft entered a steep spin to the right, slowing to a flat spin before it struck the ground. The T-33 pilot was thrown clear of the flaming jet and parachuted safely to the ground but was badly burned. The jet disintegrated after the collision and the passenger was fatally injured.<ref name=bae/><ref name=asn>{{cite web |url=https://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19580520-1\n|title=Accident description|author=|date= 2018|website=aviation-safety.net|publisher=Aviation Safety Network (ASN)|access-date=16 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=vic>{{cite web |url=http://www.vickersviscount.net/Index/VickersViscount108History.aspx\n|title=Viscount c/n 108 |author=Geoff Blampied|date=2018|website=www.vickersviscount.net|publisher=Vickers Viscount Network|access-date=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Aircraft and crew==\n\n=== Vickers aircraft and crew ===\nThe four engine Viscount V.745 British medium-range [[turboprop]] [[airliner]], serial number 108, first flew from Hampshire, England on 6 January, 1956. Powered by [[Rolls-Royce Dart|Rolls-Royce Dart RDa3 Mark 506]] engines turning four blade square tipped [[constant-speed propeller|constant-speed propellers]], it was delivered to Capital Airlines on 15 January, 1956 as fleet number 329.<ref name=bae/>\n\nThe pilot in command of Flight 300 was Captain Kendall Brady, age 38. He had a valid airman certificate and was rated to fly single/multi-engine land aircraft as well as the Douglas DC-3, DC-4 and the Vickers Viscount. Brady's total flying hours were 12,719 with 1,432 of those in the Viscount. He was hired by Capital Airlines on 11 June, 1945.<ref name=bae/>\n\nPaul Meyer, age 26, served as co-pilot and started flying for Capital Airlines on 25 May, 1956. He was certified to operate single/multi-engine land aircraft and had an instrument rating. Meyer's total flight hours were 2,467, of which 1,596 were in the Viscount.<ref name=bae/>\n\n=== T-33 aircraft and crew ===\nThe two-place Lockheed T-33A Shooting Star subsonic American jet trainer aircraft involved was manufacture serial number 580-9528 and registered 53-5966. It was maintained by the Maryland Air National Guard and equipped with an [[Allison J33|Allison J33-A-35]] turbojet engine.<ref name=bae/>\n\nThe pilot and sole survivor of the accident was Captain Julius  McCoy, age 34. He was rated as a military pilot August 4, 1944 and joined the Maryland Air National Guard in 1952. He had a total of 1,902 hours in single- and multi-engine and single-engine jet aircraft 210 were in the T-33.<ref name=bae/>\n\n==Investigation==\nThe [[Civil Aeronautics Board]] (CAB) investigated the accident and released a report on January 9, 1959. It detrimined that the collision happened during [[visual flight rules|VFR]] conditions and that both aircraft would have been in clear cloud free air nine-tenths of the time. The report noted that it is the overtaking aircraft's responsibility to see and avoid a collision. A contributing factor in the accident was that the small size of the T-33 made it difficult to pick up on radar. The board attributed no blame to the Viscount crew and stated in conclusion that \"The Board determines the probable cause of this accident was the failure of the T-33 pilot to exercise a proper and adequate vigilance to see and avoid other traffic.\"<ref name=bae/>\n\n\n==See also==\n*[[Eastern Air Lines Flight 45]]\n*[[1958 in aviation]]\n*[[List of accidents and incidents on commercial aircraft]]\n*[[Mid-air collision]] - includes a list of other notable mid-air collisions.\n\n{{Portal|Aviation}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Aviation accidents and incidents in 1958}}\n\n[[Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1958]]\n[[Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving mid-air collisions]]\n[[Category:Mid-air collisions]]\n[[Category:May 1958 events]]\n", "name_user": "Cathartid", "label": "safe", "comment": "add missing \"to\"", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Airlines_Flight_300"}

In the 2017 reboot film,  Alpha 5 is a [[CGI]] character voiced by [[Bill Hader]]. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released since the inception of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise.\n\n==Character overview==\nAlpha 5 appears as a recurring supporting character for the ''Power Rangers'' in the series. His role is to provide communications support for the Rangers on their missions and is responsible for maintenance of the Command Center. He also serves as the Rangers' technician, constructing weapons for them to use against their opponents.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> He is best known for his signature catchphrase, \"Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!\", usually uttered by the character when he is distressed or excited.<ref name=EW/><ref name=Nerdist/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/> Alpha 5's original iteration is described by Nicholas Mojica of ''[[International Business Times]]'' as a \"vintage robot look\"<ref name=IBT/>; his head is shaped like a golden [[flying saucer]], adorned with a visor that flashes when he is speaking.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Another one of the character's visual cues is an inverted yellow stylized lightning bolt similar to the Power Rangers' lightning bolt symbol on his chest.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/>  \n\nThe character is depicted as naive and childlike in temperament, and often behaves like a surrogate younger sibling to the Power Rangers wanting to spend time with them.<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/>\n\n==Creation and development==\nRichard Horvitz, credited as \"Richard Wood\" for the ''Power Rangers'' series, developed Alpha\u2019s catchphrase when the series was in development.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Horvitz also voiced Alpha 5's future successor, Alpha 7, in the ''[[Power Rangers Wild Force]]'' episode [[Forever Red]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/>\n\nRomy J. Sharf physically portrayed Alpha 5 for 89 episodes of the  ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' series as well as the ''Alpha\u2019s Magical Christmas'' holiday special.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Sandi Sellner took over the role for 19 episodes when the Power Rangers gained ninja-themed powers in season 3.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Donene Kistler, who also worked as a production assistant on the series, assumed the role for the remainder of Alpha 5's appearances in the series.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Kistler would go on to portray Alpha 5's successor, Alpha 6, for ''Power Rangers Turbo'' and ''Power Rangers In Space''.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\n==Appearances==\n===In ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers''===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}\nAlpha 5 debuted in the first episode of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' and provides a support role for the titular protagonists. Though he is a non-combatant, Alpha 5 has occasionally been involved in direct engagements with enemy forces. In one episode, Rita sent the brainwashed [[Tommy Oliver|Green Ranger]] to sabotage the Command Center; he slipped a compact disc into Alpha's inner workings, unleashing a virus which causes him to convulse violently. After Billy repaired his circuity and removed the virus, Alpha later captured the Green Ranger in a [[force field]], but Rita rescued him before Alpha could reveal his identity. In one episode, Alpha 5 left the Command Center on Zordon's instructions to retrieve a magical item known as the \"Singing Squash\" to undo a spell placed on [[Kimberly Hart|Kimberly]] and [[Billy Cranston|Billy]]. he encountered Rita's Putty Patrol, but manages to disabled his attackers with his internal defense and the magical squash.\n\nIn the second season of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', Alpha had three encounters with Lord Zedd's forces. In ''The Wannabe Ranger'', he attempted to assist a little boy lost in Angel Grove Park, but was attacked by the Primator, a shapeshifting gorilla monster who disguised himself as Billy and tried to trick Alpha into taking him to the Command Center. Alpha activated his self-destruct sequence to protect the Command Center, but seemed unable to deactivate it once the Primator left, and it was necessary for the Rangers do so. Later in the season, he would leave the Command Center to rescue the now-regressed Rangers, who had been trapped within a photograph by the Photomare monster after being regressed into children. In his attempt to capture the photo, Alpha was confronted by both Photomare and [[Goldar]], but he was able to freeze both villains with a device of his and escape. Near the end of the season, in ''The Wedding'', he was ambushed by [[Villains in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers#Finster|Finster]] and the Putties as he took a hike outside the Command Center. Just as the Green Ranger had, Finster inserted a disc into Alpha's circuits, but instead of delivering a virus, this CD warped Alpha's personality into an evil, obnoxious brat, who assisted Zedd and Rita by tricking the Rangers into an abandoned theater (which Finster proceeded to fill with monsters). Alpha also cut the Rangers off from Zordon and the Thunderzords. When Zordon's pleas for him to stop annoyed him, Alpha comically altered Zordon's image before shutting him off completely. Billy eventually removed the disc from Alpha, instantly returning him to normal.\n\nIn the third season, it was revealed that Alpha was constructed on the planet Edenoi, located in the [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda constellation]] by [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Supporting|King Lexian]], the grandfather of the [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Main|Masked Rider]]. The Power Rangers later team up with the Masked Rider against Count Dregon and his forces in a crossover episode.\n\n===In ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers''===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers}}\nAlpha initially saved the Command Center from destruction by defusing an implosion generator planted there by [[Rito Revolto|Rito]] and Goldar, though the duo's second attempt was successful as they managed to infiltrate the Command Center's basement to place Lord Zedd's detonation device. They discovered the deactivated remains of Alpha 4, Alpha 5's obsolete predecessor. Subsequently, they placed one of the detonators on Alpha 4's body, and the Center was later destroyed in the explosion.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Zeo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Zeo}}\nAlpha 5 was later shown to have survived the events of ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers'', as he is discovered to be safe within the secondary base, the '''Power Chamber'''. Now assisted by Billy, Alpha 5 continued to serve the Rangers (now the [[Power Rangers Zeo]]) as they battled the Machine Empire.<ref name=\"Dorama\"/> A brief encounter with the Cogs resulted badly for Alpha, being short-circuited by an electric shock from one of their spears.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Turbo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Turbo}}\nWhen Zordon left for his home planet of Eltar (in ''Shift Into Turbo''), Alpha 5 went with him, saddened that he was leaving the Rangers behind.

In the 2017 reboot film,  Alpha 5 is a [[CGI]] character voiced by [[Bill Hader]]. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released since the inception of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise.\n\n==Character overview==\nAlpha 5 appears as a recurring supporting character for the ''Power Rangers'' in the series. His role is to provide communications support for the Rangers on their missions and is responsible for maintenance of the Command Center. He also serves as the Rangers' technician, constructing weapons for them to use against their opponents.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> He is best known for his signature catchphrase, \"Aye-yi-yi-yi-yi!\", usually uttered by the character when he is distressed or excited.<ref name=EW/><ref name=Nerdist/><ref name=\"Meeting\"/> Alpha 5's original iteration is described by Nicholas Mojica of ''[[International Business Times]]'' as a \"vintage robot look\"<ref name=IBT/>; his head is shaped like a golden [[flying saucer]], adorned with a visor that flashes when he is speaking.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Another one of the character's visual cues is an inverted yellow stylized lightning bolt similar to the Power Rangers' lightning bolt symbol on his chest.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/>  \n\nThe character is depicted as naive and childlike in temperament, and often behaves like a surrogate younger sibling to the Power Rangers wanting to spend time with them.<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/>\n\n==Creation and development==\nRichard Horvitz, credited as \"Richard Wood\" for the ''Power Rangers'' series, developed Alpha\u2019s catchphrase when the series was in development.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Horvitz also voiced Alpha 5's future successor, Alpha 7, in the ''[[Power Rangers Wild Force]]'' episode [[Forever Red]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/>\n\nRomy J. Sharf physically portrayed Alpha 5 for 89 episodes of the  ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' series as well as the ''Alpha\u2019s Magical Christmas'' holiday special.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Sandi Sellner took over the role for 19 episodes when the Power Rangers gained ninja-themed powers in season 3.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Donene Kistler, who also worked as a production assistant on the series, assumed the role for the remainder of Alpha 5's appearances in the series.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Kistler would go on to portray Alpha 5's successor, Alpha 6, for ''Power Rangers Turbo'' and ''Power Rangers In Space''.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\n==Appearances==\n===In ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers''===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}\nAlpha 5 debuted in the first episode of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' and provides a support role for the titular protagonists. Though he is a non-combatant, Alpha 5 has occasionally been involved in direct engagements with enemy forces. In one episode, Rita sent the brainwashed [[Tommy Oliver|Green Ranger]] to sabotage the Command Center; he slipped a compact disc into Alpha's inner workings, unleashing a virus which causes him to convulse violently. After Billy repaired his circuity and removed the virus, Alpha later captured the Green Ranger in a [[force field]], but Rita rescued him before Alpha could reveal his identity. In one episode, Alpha 5 left the Command Center on Zordon's instructions to retrieve a magical item known as the \"Singing Squash\" to undo a spell placed on [[Kimberly Hart|Kimberly]] and [[Billy Cranston|Billy]]. he encountered Rita's Putty Patrol, but manages to disabled his attackers with his internal defense and the magical squash.\n\nIn the second season of ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', Alpha had three encounters with Lord Zedd's forces. In ''The Wannabe Ranger'', he attempted to assist a little boy lost in Angel Grove Park, but was attacked by the Primator, a shapeshifting gorilla monster who disguised himself as Billy and tried to trick Alpha into taking him to the Command Center. Alpha activated his self-destruct sequence to protect the Command Center, but seemed unable to deactivate it once the Primator left, and it was necessary for the Rangers do so. Later in the season, he would leave the Command Center to rescue the now-regressed Rangers, who had been trapped within a photograph by the Photomare monster after being regressed into children. In his attempt to capture the photo, Alpha was confronted by both Photomare and [[Goldar]], but he was able to freeze both villains with a device of his and escape. Near the end of the season, in ''The Wedding'', he was ambushed by [[Villains in Mighty Morphin Power Rangers#Finster|Finster]] and the Putties as he took a hike outside the Command Center. Just as the Green Ranger had, Finster inserted a disc into Alpha's circuits, but instead of delivering a virus, this CD warped Alpha's personality into an evil, obnoxious brat, who assisted Zedd and Rita by tricking the Rangers into an abandoned theater (which Finster proceeded to fill with monsters). Alpha also cut the Rangers off from Zordon and the Thunderzords. When Zordon's pleas for him to stop annoyed him, Alpha comically altered Zordon's image before shutting him off completely. Billy eventually removed the disc from Alpha, instantly returning him to normal.\n\nIn the third season, it was revealed that Alpha was constructed on the planet Edenoi, located in the [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda constellation]] by [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Supporting|King Lexian]], the grandfather of the [[Masked Rider (TV series)#Main|Masked Rider]]. The Power Rangers later team up with the Masked Rider against Count Dregon and his forces in a crossover episode.\n\n===In ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers''===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers}}\nAlpha initially saved the Command Center from destruction by defusing an implosion generator planted there by [[Rito Revolto|Rito]] and Goldar, though the duo's second attempt was successful as they managed to infiltrate the Command Center's basement to place Lord Zedd's detonation device. They discovered the deactivated remains of Alpha 4, Alpha 5's obsolete predecessor. Subsequently, they placed one of the detonators on Alpha 4's body, and the Center was later destroyed in the explosion.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Zeo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Zeo}}\nAlpha 5 was later shown to have survived the events of ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers'', as he is discovered to be safe within the secondary base, the '''Power Chamber'''. Now assisted by Billy, Alpha 5 continued to serve the Rangers (now the [[Power Rangers Zeo]]) as they battled the Machine Empire.<ref name=\"Dorama\"/> A brief encounter with the Cogs resulted badly for Alpha, being short-circuited by an electric shock from one of their spears.\n\n===In ''Power Rangers Turbo''===\n{{main|Power Rangers Turbo}}\nWhen Zordon left for his home planet of Eltar (in ''Shift Into Turbo''), Alpha 5 went with him, saddened that he was leaving the Rangers behind. The two later briefly returned in ''[[List of Power Rangers Turbo episodes|Passing of the Torch]]'', in which [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]], [[Adam Park|Adam]], [[Katherine Hillard|Kat]], and [[Tanya Sloan|Tanya]] retired from their Ranger duties. In this episode, Alpha 5 is shown in his original body. This episode would be his last appearance in the franchise, as his role in the ''Power Rangers'' series is replaced by Alpha 6. Alpha 5 was last mentioned in the franchise, as the creator of the robotic versions of the Turbo Rangers in the episode \"The Robot Ranger\". \n\n==Reception==\nAlpha 5 is noted as a \"beloved\" and \"lovable\" comic relief character of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise by various sources.<ref name=\"Hollywood\"/><ref name=\"Inverse\"/><ref name=\"Chatbot\"/> Joe Anderton from ''Digital Spy'' opined that while Alpha 5  looked like he was \"made out of whatever props they could find\", to him the character's \"goofy little walk and head tilt made him feel human and relatable, as if those blinking red lights were eyes\".<ref name=\"Different\"/> Jessica Lachenal from ''The Mary Sue'' thought Alpha 5's appearance, which resembled a [[Geordi La Forge]]-style visor which light up whenever he speaks, was \"adorable\" and \"endearing\".<ref name=\"MarySue\"/>\n\n==In other media==\n===Movies===\n====''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' ====\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie}}\nPeta-Maree Rixon physically portrayed Alpha 5 as the suit actor for ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie''.
