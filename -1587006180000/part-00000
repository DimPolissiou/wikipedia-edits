Wallenstein became the [[Commander-in-chief|supreme commander]] of the armies of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] and was a major figure of the Thirty Years' War.\n\nWallenstein was born in the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] into a poor [[Protestant]] noble family. He acquired a multilingual university education across Europe and converted to [[Catholicism]] in 1606. A marriage in 1609 to the wealthy widow of a Bohemian [[landowner]] gave him access to considerable [[Estate (land)|estate]]s and wealth after her death at an early age in 1614. Three years later, Wallenstein embarked on a career as a [[military contractor|mercenary]] by raising forces for the Holy Roman Emperor in the [[Uskok War]] against the [[Republic of Venice]].\n\nWallenstein fought for the Catholics in the Protestant [[Bohemian revolt]] of 1618 and was awarded estates confiscated from the rebels after their defeat at [[Battle of White Mountain|White Mountain]] in 1620. A series of military victories against the Protestants raised Wallenstein's reputation in the Imperial court and in 1625 he raised a large army of 50,000 men to further the Imperial cause. A year later, he administered a crushing defeat to the Protestants at [[Battle of Dessau Bridge|Dessau Bridge]].

Wallenstein associated himself with the cause of the [[Catholics]] and the [[Habsburg dynasty]].\n\nIn the summer of 1618 Count Thurn led 10,000 troops into Moravia to secure their loyalty to the rebellion. Nobles who wished for a rapprochement with Ferdinand faced a choice. Senior nobleman Zierotin's son-in-law, Georg von Nachod, commanded the Moravian cavalry and his brother-in-law, Wallenstein, the infantry. Both decided to take their regiment into Austria. Nachod's troops rebelled and he fled for his life. Wallenstein's major demanded authorisation from the Estates upon which Wallenstein drew his sword and ran him through,\"A fresh major was immediately appointed and displayed greater tractability\".<ref>Wallenstein his life narrated by Golo Mann</ref>  Deserting the Bohemians, he marched his regiment to Vienna taking with him the Moravian treasury. There, however, the authorities told him that the money would go back to the Moravians \u2013 but he had shown his loyalty to Ferdinand, the future Emperor.\n\nWallenstein equipped a regiment of [[cuirassier]]s and won great distinction under [[Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy]] in the wars against [[Ernst von Mansfeld]] and [[Gabriel Bethlen]] (both supporters of the Bohemian revolt) in [[Moravia]]. Wallenstein recovered his lands (which the rebels had seized in 1619) and after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (8 November 1620) he secured the estates belonging to his mother's family and confiscated tracts of Protestant lands.\n\nHe grouped his new possessions into a territory called [[Fr\u00fddlant v \u010cechach|Friedland (Fr\u00fddlant)]] in northern Bohemia.  A series of successes in battle led to Wallenstein becoming in 1622 an imperial [[count palatine]], in 1623 a prince, and in 1625 [[Duke]] of [[Duchy of Friedland|Friedland]].<ref name=Schiller>Schiller, J.

Ferdinand suspected Wallenstein of planning a coup to take control of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Emperor's advisors advocated dismissing him, and in September 1630 envoys were sent to Wallenstein to announce his dismissal.<ref name=Schiller/>. The decision was taken at Regensburg on 13 August 1630 on the following day Wallenstein's financier De Witte committed suicide (having accrued a mountain of debt financing Wallenstein )<ref>Wallenstein his life narrated by Golo Mann</ref>\n\nWallenstein gave over his army to General Tilly and retired to [[Ji\u010d\u00edn]], the capital of his Duchy of Friedland. There he lived in an atmosphere of \"mysterious magnificence\".<ref name= Ingrao>Ingrao, Charles W.

He drove the Saxon army from Bohemia and then advanced against Gustavus Adolphus, whom he opposed near [[Nuremberg]] and, after the [[Battle of the Alte Veste]], dislodged. In November the great [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1632)|Battle of L\u00fctzen]] was fought, in which Wallenstein was forced to retreat but, in the confused melee, Gustavus Adolphus was killed. Wallenstein withdrew to winter quarters in Bohemia.<ref name=Ingrao/>\n[[File:Rudolf Otto von Ottenfeld - Vald\u0161tejn\u016fv t\u00e1bor.jpg|thumb|left|Wallenstein's camp]]\nIn the campaigning of 1633, Wallenstein's apparent unwillingness to attack the enemy caused much concern in Vienna and in Spain. At this time the dimensions of the war had grown more European, and Wallenstein had begun preparing to desert the Emperor. He expressed anger at Ferdinand's refusal to revoke the [[Edict of Restitution]]. Historic records tell little about his secret negotiations but some sources {{clarify|date=June 2017}} indicated he was preparing to force a \"just peace\" on the Emperor \"in the interests of united [[Germany]]\". With this apparent \"plan\" he entered into negotiations with [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], and [[France]]. Apparently the Habsburgs' enemies tried to draw him to their side. In any case, he gained little support. Anxious to make his power felt, he resumed the offensive against the Swedes and Saxons, winning his last victory at [[\u015acinawa|Steinau]] on the [[Oder]] in October. He then resumed negotiations.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|page=281}}\n\n==Assassination==\n[[File:Ermordung-wallensteins-in-eger-anonymer-kupferstich 1-640x370.jpg|thumb|300px|The Killing of Wallenstein in [[Cheb|Eger/Cheb]].]]\nIn December Wallenstein retired with his army to Bohemia, around Pilsen (now [[Plze\u0148]]). Vienna soon definitely convinced itself of his treachery, a [[secret court]] found him guilty, and the Emperor looked seriously for a means of getting rid of him (a successor in command, the later emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]], was already waiting). Wallenstein was aware of the plan to replace him, but felt confident that when the army came to decide between him and the Emperor the decision would be in his favour.<ref name=Ingrao/>\n\nOn 24 January 1634 the Emperor signed a secret [[Letters patent|patent]] (shown only to certain officers of Wallenstein's army) removing him from his command.

Even a city or a prince on the side of the Emperor had to pay taxes towards the war.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Wallenstein understood the enormous wastage of resources that resulted from tax exactions on princes and cities of defeated enemies only, and desired to replace this with a \"balanced\" system of taxation; wherein both sides bore the cost of a war.

Wallenstein associated himself with the cause of the [[Catholics]] and the [[Habsburg dynasty]].\n\nIn the summer of 1618 Count Thurn led 10,000 troops into Moravia to secure their loyalty to the rebellion. Nobles who wished for a rapprochement with Ferdinand faced a choice. Senior nobleman Zierotin's son-in-law, Georg von Nachod, commanded the Moravian cavalry and his brother-in-law, Wallenstein, the infantry. Both decided to take their regiment into Austria. Nachod's troops rebelled and he fled for his life. Wallenstein's major demanded authorisation from the Estates upon which Wallenstein drew his sword and ran him through,\"A fresh major was immediately appointed and displayed greater tractability\".<ref>Wallenstein his life narrated by Golo Mann</ref>  Deserting the Bohemians, he marched his regiment to Vienna taking with him the Moravian treasury. There, however, the authorities told him that the money would go back to the Moravians \u2013 but he had shown his loyalty to Ferdinand, the future Emperor.\n\nWallenstein equipped a regiment of [[cuirassier]]s and won great distinction under [[Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy]] in the wars against [[Ernst von Mansfeld]] and [[Gabriel Bethlen]] (both supporters of the Bohemian revolt) in [[Moravia]]. Wallenstein recovered his lands (which the rebels had seized in 1619) and after the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (8 November 1620) he secured the estates belonging to his mother's family and confiscated tracts of Protestant lands.\n\nHe grouped his new possessions into a territory called [[Fr\u00fddlant v \u010cechach|Friedland (Fr\u00fddlant)]] in northern Bohemia.  A series of successes in battle led to Wallenstein becoming in 1622 an imperial [[count palatine]], in 1623 a prince, and in 1625 [[Duke]] of [[Duchy of Friedland|Friedland]].<ref name=Schiller>Schiller, J.

In November the great [[Battle of L\u00fctzen (1632)|Battle of L\u00fctzen]] was fought, in which Wallenstein was forced to retreat but, in the confused melee, Gustavus Adolphus was killed.

At this time the dimensions of the war had grown more European, and Wallenstein had begun preparing to desert the Emperor. He expressed anger at Ferdinand's refusal to revoke the [[Edict of Restitution]]. Historic records tell little about his secret negotiations but some sources {{clarify|date=June 2017}} indicated he was preparing to force a \"just peace\" on the Emperor \"in the interests of united [[Germany]]\". With this apparent \"plan\" he entered into negotiations with [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]], [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], and [[France]]. Apparently the Habsburgs' enemies tried to draw him to their side. In any case, he gained little support. Anxious to make his power felt, he resumed the offensive against the Swedes and Saxons, winning his last victory at [[\u015acinawa|Steinau]] on the [[Oder]] in October.

Vienna soon definitely convinced itself of his treachery, a [[secret court]] found him guilty, and the Emperor looked seriously for a means of getting rid of him (a successor in command, the later emperor [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]], was already waiting).

Based in [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], he was hired to plat the settlements at the ends of the proposed [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]]; he completed the plat of Chicago, the settlement at the eastern end, on August 4, 1830. \n\nBorn in [[South Carolina]], Thompson moved to Kaskaskia as a young adult and lived in the area for the rest of his life. After completing his survey of Chicago he returned to the area and declined an offer of land in Chicago in favor of cash. In addition to his surveying work he served in various positions such as Probate&nbsp;Judge, county&nbsp;commissioner, and officer in the Illinois [[militia (United States)|militia]] in the [[Black Hawk War]]. He died in 1872.\n\nChicago appears on maps from the 17th century and had been inhabited by non-indigenous people since the late 18th century. Thompson's plat fixed the location associated with the word \"Chicago\", which had previously been used for various places around the southwestern shore of [[Lake Michigan]], and allowed the residents of the area to obtain legal title of their property. Extensions of Thompson's plat were made in the following years as the settlement experienced a land boom. Chicago incorporated as a town in 1833 and as a city in 1837 as growth continued; by 1890 it was the second-largest city in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\nJames Thompson was born in 1789 in [[Abbeville, South Carolina]], to Mary Glasgow and John Porter Thompson. His parents were [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] immigrants who had moved to the area shortly before the [[American Revolution]]. Members of the Scots-Irish community in Abbeville created a settlement near Kaskaskia in [[Randolph County, Illinois]], in 1802. Two of Thompson's uncles moved to the settlement in 1804, followed by Thompson and a brother in 1814. Thompson served as a teacher in Kaskaskia for three years before marrying his cousin Margaret in October&nbsp;1817 and thereafter living in nearby [[Preston, Illinois|Preston]]. The couple would ultimately raise 12 children.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\">{{cite web |title=James Thompson |url=https://randolphsociety.org/james-thompson/ |publisher=The Randolph Society |accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nThompson surveyed the Kaskaskia and Covington Road in 1819, connecting Randolph County with [[St. Clair County, Illinois|St. Clair]] and [[Washington County, Illinois|Washington]] counties.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> He served as a county commissioner during 1820 and 1821 alongside David Anderson and Niles Hotchkiss.{{sfn|Montague|p=122|ps=none}} In that position he implemented the [[1820 United States Census]] and contemporary state census in Randolph County.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> He was appointed as a United States surveyor in 1821 and held that position for over 20 years.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> He surveyed several other roads in and around Randolph County, including one linking Kaskaskia to the new state capital of [[Vandalia, Illinois|Vandalia]] in 1824.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> He surveyed the county line between Randolph and [[Monroe County, Illinois|Monroe]] counties in February 1830.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/>\n\n===Plat of Chicago===\n[[File:Thompson plat of Chicago 1830.png|thumb|Thompson's [[plat]] of Chicago]]\nShortly after attaining statehood in 1818, Illinois planned to connect the [[Illinois River]] to the Eastern United States by a canal connecting it with the [[Great Lakes]] and thereby the [[Erie Canal]].{{sfn|Miller|p=59|ps=none}} Congress granted a right of way for the proposed [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] to the state in 1822, and parcels of land adjoining the proposed canal to sell and raise funds for the its construction in 1827.{{sfn|Miller|p=59|ps=none}} In 1830 state-appointed commissioners of the proposed canal hired Thompson to survey areas at the two proposed ends of the canal.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> He finished surveying the western area of [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]] on July 5 and the eastern area of Chicago on August 4.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> \n\nThompson's survey of Chicago was bounded by Kinzie Street, [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Madison Street]], [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]], and Desplaines Street,{{efn|The ''Chicago Tribune'' claimed in 1955 that the northern and western boundaries of Thompson's survey were actually [[Hubbard Street]] and Union Street, respectively.<ref name=\"Tribune p. 5\"/> Kinzie Street and \"Des Pleins Street\" are the respective northernmost and westernmost named streets in the copy of the plat held by the Chicago History Muesum.<ref name=\"Plat\">{{cite encyclopedia |work=Encyclopedia of Chicago |title=Thompson's Plat of 1830 |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11175.html |accessdate=January 13, 2020 |date=2004}}</ref> }}{{sfn|Andreas|p=111|ps=none}} an area of about {{convert|0.375|sqmi}}.<ref name=\"Tribune p. 1\"/> It was divided into 58 blocks which were assigned numbers from northeast to southeast in a ''[[boustrophedon]]'' order.<ref name=\"Plat\"/> It contained streets {{convert|66|ft}} wide and alleys {{convert|16|ft}} wide.<ref name=\"Plat\"/> The pioneer Mark Beaubien's cabin ended up in the middle of one of the streets;

Based in [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], he was hired to plat the settlements at the ends of the proposed [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]]; he completed the plat of Chicago, the settlement at the eastern end, on August 4, 1830. \n\nBorn in [[South Carolina]], Thompson moved to Kaskaskia as a young adult and lived in the area for the rest of his life. After completing his survey of Chicago he returned to the area and declined an offer of land in Chicago in favor of cash. In addition to his surveying work he served in various positions such as Probate&nbsp;Judge, county&nbsp;commissioner, and officer in the Illinois [[militia (United States)|militia]] in the [[Black Hawk War]]. He died in 1872.\n\nChicago appears on maps from the 17th century and had been inhabited by non-indigenous people since the late 18th century. Thompson's plat fixed the location associated with the word \"Chicago\", which had previously been used for various places around the southwestern shore of [[Lake Michigan]], and allowed the residents of the area to obtain legal title of their property. Extensions of Thompson's plat were made in the following years as the settlement experienced a land boom. Chicago incorporated as a town in 1833 and as a city in 1837 as growth continued; by 1890 it was the second-largest city in the United States.\n\n==Early life==\nJames Thompson was born in 1789 in [[Abbeville, South Carolina]], to Mary Glasgow and John Porter Thompson. His parents were [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] immigrants who had moved to the area shortly before the [[American Revolution]]. Members of the Scots-Irish community in Abbeville created a settlement near Kaskaskia in [[Randolph County, Illinois]], in 1802. Two of Thompson's uncles moved to the settlement in 1804, followed by Thompson and a brother in 1814. Thompson served as a teacher in Kaskaskia for three years before marrying his cousin Margaret in October 1817 and thereafter living in nearby [[Preston, Illinois|Preston]]. The couple would ultimately raise 12 children.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\">{{cite web |title=James Thompson |url=https://randolphsociety.org/james-thompson/ |publisher=The Randolph Society |accessdate=January 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career===\nThompson surveyed the Kaskaskia and Covington Road in 1819, connecting Randolph County with [[St. Clair County, Illinois|St. Clair]] and [[Washington County, Illinois|Washington]] counties.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> He served as a county commissioner during 1820 and 1821 alongside David Anderson and Niles Hotchkiss.{{sfn|Montague|p=122|ps=none}} In that position he implemented the [[1820 United States Census]] and contemporary state census in Randolph County.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> He was appointed as a United States surveyor in 1821 and held that position for over 20 years.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> He surveyed several other roads in and around Randolph County, including one linking Kaskaskia to the new state capital of [[Vandalia, Illinois|Vandalia]] in 1824.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> He surveyed the county line between Randolph and [[Monroe County, Illinois|Monroe]] counties in February 1830.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/>\n\n===Plat of Chicago===\n[[File:Thompson plat of Chicago 1830.png|thumb|Thompson's [[plat]] of Chicago]]\nShortly after attaining statehood in 1818, Illinois planned to connect the [[Illinois River]] to the Eastern United States by a canal connecting it with the [[Great Lakes]] and thereby the [[Erie Canal]].{{sfn|Miller|p=59|ps=none}} Congress granted a right of way for the proposed [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]] to the state in 1822, and parcels of land adjoining the proposed canal to sell and raise funds for the its construction in 1827.{{sfn|Miller|p=59|ps=none}} In 1830 state-appointed commissioners of the proposed canal hired Thompson to survey areas at the two proposed ends of the canal.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> He finished surveying the western area of [[Ottawa, Illinois|Ottawa]] on July 5 and the eastern area of Chicago on August 4.<ref name=\"Randolph Society\"/> \n\nThompson's survey of Chicago was bounded by Kinzie Street, [[Madison Street (Chicago)|Madison Street]], [[State Street (Chicago)|State Street]], and Desplaines Street,{{efn|The ''Chicago Tribune'' claimed in 1955 that the northern and western boundaries of Thompson's survey were actually [[Hubbard Street]] and Union Street, respectively.<ref name=\"Tribune p. 5\"/> Kinzie Street and \"Des Pleins Street\" are the respective northernmost and westernmost named streets in the copy of the plat held by the Chicago History Muesum.<ref name=\"Plat\">{{cite encyclopedia |work=Encyclopedia of Chicago |title=Thompson's Plat of 1830 |publisher=Chicago Historical Society |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11175.html |accessdate=January 13, 2020 |date=2004}}</ref> }}{{sfn|Andreas|p=111|ps=none}} an area of about {{convert|0.375|sqmi}}.<ref name=\"Tribune p. 1\"/> It was divided into 58 blocks which were assigned numbers from northeast to southeast in a ''[[boustrophedon]]'' order.<ref name=\"Plat\"/> It contained streets {{convert|66|ft}} wide and alleys {{convert|16|ft}} wide.<ref name=\"Plat\"/> The pioneer Mark Beaubien's cabin ended up in the middle of one of the streets;

Mac and her childhood friends Parker, Emma, and Laurel are the founders of Vows, a fictional wedding planning company in Connecticut. While accompanying his sister to a planning session at Vows, Carter renews his acquaintance with Mac, and confesses that he had been infatuated with her since high school. She is intrigued by his honesty and earnestness and decides to embark on a casual fling with him.\n\nAfter seeing her parents' numerous failed marriages, Mac does not trust the idea of commitment. Her determination to avoid emotional intimacy is reinforced as she struggles against her mother's continued tactics of [[emotional manipulation]].\n\nTheir relationship progresses slowly through the book. Each protagonist receives much advice from a large circle of friends and family. With the support of her friends and Carter, Mac develops the courage to stand up to her mother. By the end of the novel, she realizes that she does not have to relive her parents' mistakes, and chooses to embrace her love for Carter.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:NoraRoberts.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Author [[Nora Roberts]]]]\nThe four novels of the Bride Quartet share a strong emphasis on sisterhood. The heroines of the books bonded as children and have become sisters by choice. Throughout the series, they provide mutual support and acceptance of each other's quirks.

It spent two weeks atop the ''[[New York Times]]'' Bestseller List and reached number 3 on the ''[[USA Today]]'' bestseller list, marking the first time one of Roberts' books had become a bestseller in [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] format. A downloadable casual-play computer game based on the book was introduced by [[Oberon Media|I-Play]] in 2010.\n\nIn her thirty-year career, Roberts had published almost 200 novels. ''Vision in White'' was one of ten Roberts novels published in 2009, including five new releases and five reprints. When it was released on April 28, 2009, its cover premiered the use of a special logo to differentiate her new releases from reprints of her past works.\n\nThe novel marked Roberts' return to [[contemporary romance]]. The new series revolved around a wedding planning enterprise run by four childhood friends. This first story featured the developing relationship between wedding photographer Mackensie \"Mac\" Elliot and English professor Carter Maguire. Like several other Roberts novels, ''Vision in White'' explored how a protagonist balanced a successful career with a dysfunctional family environment. Although the hero is a fairly typical representation of the romance novel archetype of the professor, the novel is slightly unusual for a romance in that the hero must convince the heroine to take a chance on love.\n\n==Background==\n[[Nora Roberts]] is a prolific author of [[romance novel|romance]] and futuristic suspense novels.<ref name=kopun>{{citation|last=Kopun|first=Francine|title=Nora Roberts, a bestselling author rarely reviewed|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=October 19, 2009|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2009/10/19/nora_roberts_a_bestselling_author_rarely_reviewed.html|accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> From 1979 through 2008, almost 200 of her novels were published. On average, she completed a book every 45 days.

Five of the releases were paperback reprints of books previously issued. Three were new hardcovers, including two published under the pseudonym J. D. Robb.

Mac and her childhood friends Parker, Emma, and Laurel are the founders of Vows, a fictional wedding planning company in Connecticut. While accompanying his sister to a planning session at Vows, Carter renews his acquaintance with Mac, and confesses that he had been infatuated with her since high school. She is intrigued by his honesty and earnestness and decides to embark on a casual fling with him.\n\nAfter seeing her parents' numerous failed marriages, Mac does not trust the idea of commitment. Her determination to avoid emotional intimacy is reinforced as she struggles against her mother's continued tactics of [[emotional manipulation]].\n\nTheir relationship progresses slowly through the book. Each protagonist receives much advice from a large circle of friends and family. With the support of her friends and Carter, Mac develops the courage to stand up to her mother. By the end of the novel, she realizes that she does not have to relive her parents' mistakes, and chooses to embrace her love for Carter.\n\n==Analysis==\n[[File:NoraRoberts.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Author [[Nora Roberts]]]]\nThe four novels of the Bride Quartet share a strong emphasis on sisterhood. The heroines of the books bonded as children and have become sisters by choice. Throughout the series, they provide mutual support and acceptance of each other's quirks.

'''Metal Planet Music''' voiced that \"the first thing that strikes you is the music, great hard rock with melody and class, but it\u2019s the heart and emotion that will stay with you long after the last note rings out. Coming eight years after their debut, \u2018'''''The Burning'''''\u2019 is the second album by [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]] and the [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] led quintet have made a record that is at once modern, nostalgic and timeless\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2020/01/gig-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review : British Lion \u2013 \u2018The Burning|last=Authoradmin|date=2020-01-22|website=Metal Planet Music|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Kerrang!]] mainly spoke upon the vocals of the album stating that \"the band\u2019s debut was rather a baptism of fire for singer '''Richard Taylor''', who had to weather some predictable yet redundant criticisms comparing him to [[Bruce Dickinson]] from Steve\u2019s \u201cother\u201d band. He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] rated the album a 4/5, and believes \"'''''The Burning''''' sounds vastly more punchy and powerful than its predecessor, while also giving the distinct impression that '''British Lion''' have evolved into a fiery and characterful ensemble with a strong identity of their own\". The review continued by stating that \"we are still firmly in traditional rock territory here, and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]]\u2019s love of [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Golden Earring]] remains as cheerfully conspicuous as ever, but thanks to a brighter, breezier sound and unmistakable hints of looseness and swagger, everything from the briskly uplifting title track to the brooding hulk of '''Bible Black''' sparkles with freshness and weirdly youthful vigour\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/british-lion-arrys-other-army-return-on-sizzling-form|title=British Lion: \u2018Arry\u2019s other army return on sizzling form|last=January 2020|first=Dom Lawson 17|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n'''Metal Temple''' deemed the album a 9/10 saying '''\u201c''The Burning''\u201d''' is just what a sophomore album should be.

'''Metal Planet Music''' voiced that \"the first thing that strikes you is the music, great hard rock with melody and class, but it\u2019s the heart and emotion that will stay with you long after the last note rings out. Coming eight years after their debut, \u2018'''''The Burning'''''\u2019 is the second album by [[British Lion (Band)|British Lion]] and the [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]] led quintet have made a record that is at once modern, nostalgic and timeless\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalplanetmusic.com/2020/01/gig-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review : British Lion \u2013 \u2018The Burning|last=Authoradmin|date=2020-01-22|website=Metal Planet Music|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Kerrang!]] mainly spoke upon the vocals of the album stating that \"the band\u2019s debut was rather a baptism of fire for singer '''Richard Taylor''', who had to weather some predictable yet redundant criticisms comparing him to [[Bruce Dickinson]] from Steve\u2019s \u201cother\u201d band. He sings like he has a point to prove throughout '''''The Burning'''''. A telling sign of the frontman\u2019s burgeoning confidence comes on '''Elysium''' \u2013 a song that boasts a killer chorus but an even better final passage, as he belts out a series of absolutely massive sustained notes over a swelling choral section. Equally impressive is his ability to extract emotion from a song. Whether he\u2019s communing with lost souls on '''Lightning''' or offering a consolatory ear on closer '''Native Son''', he often brings a moving sense of fragility to the fore. Clearly, this particular lion has more at its disposal than claws alone\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrang.com/reviews/album-review-british-lion-the-burning/|title=Album Review: British Lion \u2013 The Burning|website=Kerrang!|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] rated the album a 4/5, and believes \"'''''The Burning''''' sounds vastly more punchy and powerful than its predecessor, while also giving the distinct impression that '''British Lion''' have evolved into a fiery and characterful ensemble with a strong identity of their own\". The review continued by stating that \"we are still firmly in traditional rock territory here, and [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]]\u2019s love of [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Golden Earring]] remains as cheerfully conspicuous as ever, but thanks to a brighter, breezier sound and unmistakable hints of looseness and swagger, everything from the briskly uplifting title track to the brooding hulk of '''Bible Black''' sparkles with freshness and weirdly youthful vigour\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/british-lion-arrys-other-army-return-on-sizzling-form|title=British Lion: \u2018Arry\u2019s other army return on sizzling form|last=January 2020|first=Dom Lawson 17|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n'''Metal Temple''' deemed the album a 9/10 saying '''\u201c''The Burning''\u201d''' is just what a sophomore album should be. A continuation, with enthusiasm, growth and development. [[Steve Harris (musician)|Harris]] is his usual subdued bass thumping brilliance. '''Hawkins''' and '''Leslie's''' dual guitar attack is on point, '''Dawson's''' drums precise and well deftly executed. '''Taylor's''' vocals add a final layer of confidence to the formula that seals the deal.

The system consists of 3 lines. Lines 60 and 61, connect [[Utrecht Centraal railway station]] with the [[residential area|residential areas]] of Lombok and Kanaleneiland and the suburbs [[Nieuwegein]] and [[IJsselstein]]. Line 22 connects Utrecht Centraal to the [[Uithof]] district.\n\n==Lines==\nLines 60 and 61 are collectively dubbed the ''SUNIJ-lijn'' (sneltram Utrecht-Nieuwegein/IJsselstein) after the communities served. Both lines serve the stops between Jaarbeursplein at [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Utrecht Centraal station]] and [[Stadscentrum (tram stop)|Stadscentrum]] in [[Nieuwegein]] before each line branches to separate termini, line 60 to [[Nieuwegein-Zuid (tram stop)|IJsselstein-Zuid]] and line 61 to Nieuwegein-Zuid.<ref name=\"UHL-vragen\"/><ref name=\"Urban-Rail-map\"/> \n\t\nLine 22, dubbed the ''Uithoflijn'', runs from the Centrumzijde stop (''centrumzijde'' literally meaning \"downtown side\") at Utrecht Centraal station to P+R Science Park in the [[Uithof]] district.<ref name=\"Urban-Rail-map\"/> Line 22 operates Monday to Friday until 22:00; there is no weekend service.<ref name=\"UHL-vragen\"/> Service is every 10 minutes and a trip the full length of the line, from Centrumzijde to P+R Science Park, takes 19 minutes. Service uses CAF trams coupled in pairs.<ref name=\"Regio-2018-12-13\"/>\n\nThere are tram tracks between Jaarbeursplein on the west side of Utrecht Centraal station and Centrumzijde on the east side of the station, but there will be no tram service between the two stops until late 2020. The vehicles and platforms on the SUNIJ-lijn and Uithoflijn are incompatible with the former using high-floor trams and high-level platforms, and the latter using low-floor trams and low-level platforms. During the summer of 2020, the SUNIJ-lijn will be closed to lower the platforms; at that time the high-floor trams will be retired. At the end of 2020, trams will provide through-service between P+R Science Park (Uithof district) and to both Nieuwegein-Zuid and IJsselstein-Zuid without a transfer at Utrecht Centraal.<ref name=\"UHL-vragen\"/><ref name=\"Urban-Rail-map\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A second branch of the line (line 61), to [[IJsselstein]], opened 14 December 1985.<ref name=\"AN-Utrecht\"/>\n\nFormerly operated by [[Connexxion]], the Utrecht light rail line has been operated by [[Qbuzz]] since December 2011.<ref name=\"RwyGaz-2010-10-26\"/>\n\nIn 2009, the Moreelsepark stop was closed to accommodate the construction of a new public transit terminal. Until this time, Moreelsepark was the downtown terminal for the ''sneltram''. With its closure, the stop Centraal Station became the new terminal.<ref name=\"utrecht.nl-20090303\"/>\n\nIn 2013, the stops Centraal Station and Westplein closed due to construction at [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Utrecht Centraal]] station. The stop Jaarbeursplein became the new temporary terminal.<ref name=\"rtvu-20130422\"/><ref name=\"AN-Utrecht\"/><ref name=\"UHL-vragen\"/>\n\nIn December 2016, the first low-floor CAF-tram arrived in Utrecht at the tram depot.<ref name=\"RailTech\"/> \n\nOn 18 March 2019, there was a [[Utrecht tram shooting|shooting attack]] on a tram near the junction of 24 Oktoberplein.<ref>{{cite web |title=Utrecht shooting: 'One dead' as man opens fire in tram |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47611811 |website=BBC News |accessdate=18 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318120531/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47611811 |archivedate=18 March 2019 |date=18 March 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 November 2019, a new workshop building was officially opened at the depot (Tramremise Nieuwegein). It handles maintenance for low-floor trams as well as for the older high-floor trams.<ref name=\"Utrecht-2019-11-28\"/>.\n\nOn 14 December 2019, line 22 (dubbed ''Uithoflijn'') opened from Utrecht Centraal to the Uithof district.<ref name=\"Regio-2018-12-13\"/> It replaced bus line 12, in service since 1969, which used articulated buses that were 18 and 25 metres long, the latter length having two articulations.<ref name=\"DUIC-2019-12-10\"/> Upon opening of the line, the frequency was 10 trams per hour per direction. Service was weekdays only with no service after 22:00; this was the same hours of service as for bus line 12. Bus 28 serves the route when line 22 is not running.<ref name=\"UHL-vragen\"/>\n\nEffective 2 March 2020, the frequency of line 22 was increased from 10 to 12 trams per hour per direction. By the beginning of February, the top day for ridership was 18,000. Regiotrams hoped to increase the frequency to 16 trams per hour per direction in December 2020.<ref name=\"Regio-2020-02-28\"/>\n\nEffective 20 March 2020, all tram service on line 22 was temporarily replaced by bus line 28 as a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]]. With the closure of the University of Utrecht and other institutions in Utrecht Science Park, line 22 ridership had fallen by over 90 percent. Also fewer tram drivers were available because many drivers were calling in sick. Trams on lines 60 and 61 continued to run but less frequently.<ref name=\"Regio-2020-03-19\"/> On 1 April 2020, tram service was reintroduced on line 22 but only during rush hours. Also, double-articulated buses were put into service on bus line 28. These measures were to allow greater [[physical distancing]] among passengers which include health workers employed at Utrecht Science Park.<ref name=\"Regio-2020-03-31\"/>\n\n==Vehicles==\n===High-floor trams===\n[[File:Qbuzz 5022 als U-tram, Jaarbeursplein.JPG|thumb|SIG high-floor tram ]] \nSince 1983, the SUNIJ-lijn has used 27 single-articulated, high-floor trams built by [[Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft]] (SIG). These trams weigh 37.5 ton, are 30 meter long and are capable of a maximum speed of 80&nbsp;km/h. In 2012, the SIG-trams were renovated including bogies, air-conditioning, seats and repainting.<ref name=\"Regio-Materieel\"/> \n[[File:Weens driewagenstel van de Sneltram Utrecht.JPG|left|thumb|Vienna trams purchased second-hand]] \nIn 2008, Utrecht purchased trams built in the 1980s from Vienna at a cost of 837,000 euros. The Vienna trams (''de Weense trams'') were delivered to Utrecht in 2009.<ref name=\"Regio-Materieel\"/><ref name=\"AD-2012-12-12\"/> The trams required some adjustments before going into service. They received a new onboard computer and a mobile telephone to communicate with central dispatchers. Adjustments were required to tram doorways and the platform height. These trams were used only during rush hours at the busiest stops between Utrecht Centraal and Nieuwegein Stadscentrum. Special sign boards indicated to passengers where the Vienna trams stopped. When received, the trams had no noteworthy defects, and they had run well in Vienna.<ref name=\"TR-2009-02-13\"/> However, in Utrecht the Vienna trams had technical problems costing the operator, Bestuur Regio Utrecht, 3.2 million euros in maintenance; they also caused extra wear to the rails. The rise in ridership expected in 2008 when the trams were purchased did not materialize. The trams were sold to Krakow, Poland<ref name=\"AD-2012-12-12\"/> and were disposed of by the summer of 2014.<ref name=\"Regio-Materieel\"/>\n\nIn mid summer 2020, the SUNIJ-lijn will be temporarily shut down to renovate the line and lower its platforms to accommodate low-floor trams. The SIG-trams will be replaced by CAF low-floor trams.<ref name=\"Regio-Materieel\"/>\n\n===Low-floor trams===\nThe new generation of trams are articulated, low-floor Urbos 100 trams built by [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles]] (CAF). Two versions were ordered: a shorter version with 5 articulated sections and a longer version with 7:<ref name=\"RailTech\"/>\n[[File:Opening Uithoflijn 6.jpg|thumb|CAF trams at Utrecht CS Centrumzijde, terminal of the Uithoflijn]] \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The depot building houses:<ref name=\"Utrecht-2019-11-28\"/>\n* offices\n* traffic control for trams and busses \n* check-in area for tram operators \n* workshops for the maintenance of trams\n* service department to handle emergencies and breakdowns\n\nThere are 8 tracks through the workshop including one for the tram wash. Outside in the yard, there is space to store the fleet of trams.<ref name=\"Utrecht-2019-11-28\"/> \n\nJust beyond the P+R Science Park stop on the Uithoflijn, there are additional storage tracks.<ref

[[Netherlands|Dutch]] city of [[Utrecht]]. The system consists of 3 lines. Lines 60 and 61, connect [[Utrecht Centraal railway station]] with the [[residential area|residential areas]] of Lombok and Kanaleneiland and the suburbs [[Nieuwegein]] and [[IJsselstein]]. Line 22 connects Utrecht Centraal to the [[Uithof]] district.\n\n==Lines==\nLines 60 and 61 are collectively dubbed the ''SUNIJ-lijn'' (sneltram Utrecht-Nieuwegein/IJsselstein) after the communities served. Both lines serve the stops between Jaarbeursplein at [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Utrecht Centraal station]] and [[Stadscentrum (tram stop)|Stadscentrum]] in [[Nieuwegein]] before each line branches to separate termini, line 60 to [[Nieuwegein-Zuid (tram stop)|IJsselstein-Zuid]] and line 61 to Nieuwegein-Zuid.<ref name=\"UHL-vragen\"/><ref name=\"Urban-Rail-map\"/> \n\t\nLine 22, dubbed the ''Uithoflijn'', runs from the Centrumzijde stop (''centrumzijde'' literally meaning \"downtown side\") at Utrecht Centraal station to P+R Science Park in the [[Uithof]] district.<ref name=\"Urban-Rail-map\"/> Line 22 operates Monday to Friday until 22:00; there is no weekend service.<ref name=\"UHL-vragen\"/> Service is every 10 minutes and a trip the full length of the line, from Centrumzijde to P+R Science Park, takes 19 minutes. Service uses CAF trams coupled in pairs.<ref name=\"Regio-2018-12-13\"/>\n\nThere are tram tracks between Jaarbeursplein on the west side of Utrecht Centraal station and Centrumzijde on the east side of the station, but there will be no tram service between the two stops until late 2020. The vehicles and platforms on the SUNIJ-lijn and Uithoflijn are incompatible with the former using high-floor trams and high-level platforms, and the latter using low-floor trams and low-level platforms. During the summer of 2020, the SUNIJ-lijn will be closed to lower the platforms; at that time the high-floor trams will be retired. At the end of 2020, trams will provide through-service between P+R Science Park (Uithof district) and to both Nieuwegein-Zuid and IJsselstein-Zuid without a transfer at Utrecht Centraal.<ref name=\"UHL-vragen\"/><ref name=\"Urban-Rail-map\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

A second branch of the line (line 61), to [[IJsselstein]], opened 14 December 1985.<ref name=\"AN-Utrecht\"/>\n\nFormerly operated by [[Connexxion]], the Utrecht light rail line has been operated by [[Qbuzz]] since December 2011.<ref name=\"RwyGaz-2010-10-26\"/>\n\nIn 2009, the Moreelsepark stop was closed to accommodate the construction of a new public transit terminal. Until this time, Moreelsepark was the downtown terminal for the ''sneltram''. With its closure, the stop Centraal Station became the new terminal.<ref name=\"utrecht.nl-20090303\"/>\n\nIn 2013, the stops Centraal Station and Westplein closed due to construction at [[Utrecht Centraal railway station|Utrecht Centraal]] station. The stop Jaarbeursplein became the new temporary terminal.<ref name=\"rtvu-20130422\"/><ref name=\"AN-Utrecht\"/><ref name=\"UHL-vragen\"/>\n\nIn December 2016, the first low-floor CAF-tram arrived in Utrecht at the tram depot.<ref name=\"RailTech\"/> \n\nOn 18 March 2019, there was a [[Utrecht tram shooting|shooting attack]] on a tram near the junction of 24 Oktoberplein.<ref>{{cite web |title=Utrecht shooting: 'One dead' as man opens fire in tram |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47611811 |website=BBC News |accessdate=18 March 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190318120531/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47611811 |archivedate=18 March 2019 |date=18 March 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 November 2019, a new workshop building was officially opened at the depot (Tramremise Nieuwegein). It handles maintenance for low-floor trams as well as for the older high-floor trams.<ref name=\"Utrecht-2019-11-28\"/>.\n\nOn 14 December 2019, line 22 (dubbed ''Uithoflijn'') opened from Utrecht Centraal to the Uithof district.<ref name=\"Regio-2018-12-13\"/> It replaced bus line 12, in service since 1969, which used articulated buses that were 18 and 25 metres long, the latter length having two articulations.<ref name=\"DUIC-2019-12-10\"/> Upon opening of the line, the frequency was 10 trams per hour per direction. Service was weekdays only with no service after 22:00; this was the same hours of service as for bus line 12. Bus 28 serves the route when line 22 is not running.<ref name=\"UHL-vragen\"/>\n\nEffective 2 March 2020, the frequency of line 22 was increased from 10 to 12 trams per hour per direction. By the beginning of February, the top day for ridership was 18,000. Regiotrams hoped to increase the frequency to 16 trams per hour per direction in December 2020.<ref name=\"Regio-2020-02-28\"/>\n\nEffective 20 March 2020, all tram service on line 22 was temporarily replaced by bus line 28 as a result of the Coronavirus pandemic. With the closure of the University of Utrecht and other institutions in Utrecht Science Park, line 22 ridership had fallen by over 90 percent. Also fewer tram drivers were available because many drivers were calling in sick. Trams on lines 60 and 61 continued to run but less frequently.<ref name=\"Regio-2020-03-19\"/> On 1 April 2020, tram service was reintroduced on line 22 but only during rush hours. Also, double-articulated buses were put into service on bus line 28. These measures were to allow greater [[physical distancing]] among passengers which include health workers employed at Utrecht Science Park.<ref name=\"Regio-2020-03-31\"/>\n\n==Vehicles==\n===High-floor trams===\n[[File:Qbuzz 5022 als U-tram, Jaarbeursplein.JPG|thumb|SIG high-floor tram ]] \nSince 1983, the SUNIJ-lijn has used 27 single-articulated, high-floor trams built by [[Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft]] (SIG). These trams weigh 37.5 ton, are 30 meter long and are capable of a maximum speed of 80&nbsp;km/h. In 2012, the SIG-trams were renovated including bogies, air-conditioning, seats and repainting.<ref name=\"Regio-Materieel\"/> \n[[File:Weens driewagenstel van de Sneltram Utrecht.JPG|left|thumb|Vienna trams purchased second-hand]] \nIn 2008, Utrecht purchased trams built in the 1980s from Vienna at a cost of 837,000 euros. The Vienna trams (''de Weense trams'') were delivered to Utrecht in 2009.<ref name=\"Regio-Materieel\"/><ref name=\"AD-2012-12-12\"/> The trams required some adjustments before going into service. They received a new onboard computer and a mobile telephone to communicate with central dispatchers. Adjustments were required to tram doorways and the platform height. These trams were used only during rush hours at the busiest stops between Utrecht Centraal and Nieuwegein Stadscentrum. Special sign boards indicated to passengers where the Vienna trams stopped. When received, the trams had no noteworthy defects, and they had run well in Vienna.<ref name=\"TR-2009-02-13\"/> However, in Utrecht the Vienna trams had technical problems costing the operator, Bestuur Regio Utrecht, 3.2 million euros in maintenance; they also caused extra wear to the rails. The rise in ridership expected in 2008 when the trams were purchased did not materialize. The trams were sold to Krakow, Poland<ref name=\"AD-2012-12-12\"/> and were disposed of by the summer of 2014.<ref name=\"Regio-Materieel\"/>\n\nIn mid summer 2020, the SUNIJ-lijn will be temporarily shut down to renovate the line and lower its platforms to accommodate low-floor trams. The SIG-trams will be replaced by CAF low-floor trams.<ref name=\"Regio-Materieel\"/>\n\n===Low-floor trams===\nThe new generation of trams are articulated, low-floor Urbos 100 trams built by [[Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles]] (CAF). Two versions were ordered: a shorter version with 5 articulated sections and a longer version with 7:<ref name=\"RailTech\"/>\n[[File:Opening Uithoflijn 6.jpg|thumb|CAF trams at Utrecht CS Centrumzijde, terminal of the Uithoflijn]] \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The depot building houses:<ref name=\"Utrecht-2019-11-28\"/>\n* offices\n* traffic control for trams and busses \n* check-in area for tram operators \n* workshops for the maintenance of trams\n* service department to handle emergencies and breakdowns\n\nThere are 8 tracks through the workshop including one for the tram wash. Outside in the yard, there is space to store the fleet of trams.<ref name=\"Utrecht-2019-11-28\"/> \n\nJust beyond the P+R Science Park stop on the Uithoflijn, there are additional storage tracks.<ref

It is the opposite of an [[excess supply]] ([[economic surplus|surplus]]).\n\n== Definitions ==\nIn a [[perfect market]] (one that matches a simple [[microeconomic]] model), an excess of demand will prompt sellers to increase [[price]]s until demand at that price matches the available supply, establishing [[economic equilibrium|market equilibrium]]<ref>Tucker (2014) Economics Today</ref>{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}. In economic terminology, a shortage occurs when for some reason (such as government intervention, or decisions by sellers not to raise prices) the price does not rise to reach equilibrium.  In this circumstance, buyers want to purchase more at the market price than the quantity of the good or service that is available, and some non-price mechanism (such as \"first come, first served\" or a lottery) determines which buyers are served. So in a perfect market the only thing that can cause a shortage is price.\n\nIn common use, the term \"shortage\" may refer to a situation where most people are unable to find a desired good at an affordable price, especially where supply problems have increased the price.  \"[[Market clearing]]\" happens when all buyers and sellers willing to transact at the prevailing price are able to find partners.  There are almost always willing buyers at a lower-than-market-clearing price; the narrower technical definition doesn't consider failure to serve this demand as a \"shortage\", even if it would be described that way in a social or political context (which the simple model of [[supply and demand]] does not attempt to encompass).\n\n== Causes ==\nShortages (in the technical sense) may be caused for the following:\n* [[Price ceiling]]s, a type of [[price control]] which involves a government-imposed limit on the price of a product service.\n* Anti-[[price gouging]] laws.\n* Government [[ban (law)|ban]] on the sale of a product or service, such as [[prostitution]] or certain [[recreational drug use|recreational drugs]].\n* Decisions by suppliers not to raise prices, for example to maintain friendly relationships with potential future customers during a supply disruption.\n* [[Artificial scarcity]]\n\n== Effects ==\nDecisions which result in a below-market-clearing price help some people and hurt others. In this case, shortages may be accepted because they theoretically enable a certain portion of the population to purchase a product that they couldn't afford at the market-clearing price. The cost is to those who are willing to pay for a product and either can't, or experience greater difficulty in doing so.\n\nIn the case of [[government intervention]] in the market, there is always a trade-off with positive and negative effects. For example, a price ceiling may cause a shortage, but it will also enable a certain percentage of the population to purchase a product that they couldn't afford at market costs. Economic shortages caused by higher [[transaction costs]] and [[opportunity costs]] (e.g., in the form of lost time) also mean that the distribution process is wasteful. Both of these factors contribute to a decrease in aggregate wealth.\n\nShortages may cause:\n\n* [[Black Market|Black]] (illegal) and [[Grey market|Grey]] (unregulated) markets in which products that are unavailable in conventional markets are sold, or in which products with excess demand are sold at higher prices than in the conventional market.\n* Artificial controls of demand, such as time (such as waiting in line) and [[rationing]].\n* Non-monetary bargaining methods, such as time (for example [[Queue area|queuing]]), [[nepotism]], or even violence. \n* [[Panic buying]]\n* [[Price discrimination]].\n* The inability to purchase a product, and subsequent [[forced saving]].\n\n== Examples ==\n[[File:Dried pasta shelves empty in an Australian supermarket.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Empty supermarket shelves that stock dry pasta varieties due to panic-buying as the result of the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak.]]\nMany regions around the world have experienced shortages in the past.\n* Food shortages have occurred in the [[United States]] during the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/alt/mexican6.html|title=Depression and the Struggle for Survival|access-date=30 March 2020|website=Library of Congress|quote=The Great Depression of the 1930s hit Mexican immigrants especially hard.

For instance, a shortage of food can just as well be called a longage of people ([[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]). By looking at it from this view, he felt the problem could be better dealt with.<ref>[http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/videos/video_803_segment5.html Video Interview with Garrett Hardin: Longages and Overpopulation Predictions] Educational Communications program 803, 1990</ref>\n\n==Labour shortage==\n{{Further|Labour economics}}\n\nIn its narrowest definition, a labour shortage is an [[economics|economic condition]] in which employers believe there are insufficient qualified candidates (employees) to fill the [[demand|marketplace demands]] for [[employment]] at a wage that is mostly employer-determined. Such a condition is sometimes referred to by [[economist]]s as \"an insufficiency in the [[labour force]].\" An [[Aging in the American workforce|ageing population and a contracting workforce]] and a [[birth dearth]] may curb U.S. economic expansion for several decades, for example.<ref>[http://washingtonexaminer.com/news/business/2011/08/shrinking-labor-force-may-curb-us-expansion-two-decades Shrinking labour force may curb U.S. expansion for two decades]</ref>\n\n===Wage factors===\n[[Wage|Wage levels]] have been suggested as one way to measure a labour shortage. However, that often does not match people's common perceptions. For example, if wages alone are the best measure of labour shortages, then that would imply that doctors, instead of farm workers, should be imported because doctors are far more expensive than farm workers. However, there are institutionally-imposed limits on the number of doctors that are allowed to be licensed.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} If foreign migrant workers were not allowed into a nation, farm wages may go up but probably not enough to approach the wages of doctors.\n\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade]] (which originated in the early 17th century but ended by the early 19th century) was said to have originated from perceived shortages of agricultural labour in the [[Americas]] (particularly in the [[Southern United States]]). It was thought that bringing African labor was the only means of [[malaria]] resistance available at the time.<ref>[http://www.malaria.com/blog/american-plasmodium-vivax \"As American as\u2026Plasmodium vivax?\"]</ref> Ironically, malaria seems to itself have been introduced to the \"New World\" via the slave trade.<ref>[http://sciencedude.blog.ocregister.com/2011/12/26/uci-new-world-malaria-linked-to-slave-trade/166005/ \"UCI: New World malaria linked to slave trade.\"]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Aggregate demand]]\n* [[Aggregate supply]]\n* [[Aggregation problem]]\n* [[Eastern Bloc economies]]\n* [[Economic equilibrium#Disequilibrium|Disequilibrium]]\n* [[Economic surplus]]\n* [[Effective demand]]\n* [[Excess demand function]]\n* [[Excess supply]]\n* [[Induced demand]]\n* [[Keynesian formula]]\n* [[Reproduction (economics)|Reproduction]]\n* [[Scarcity]]\n* [[Shortage economy]]\n* [[Supply shock]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Kornai, J\u00e1nos, ''Socialist economy'', Princeton University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-691-00393-9}}\n* Kornai, J\u00e1nos, ''Economics of Shortage'', Amsterdam: North Holland Press, Volume A, p.&nbsp;27; Volume B, p.&nbsp;196 .\n* [[Stanislaw Gomulka|Gomulka, Stanislaw]]: ''Kornai's Soft Budget Constraint and the Shortage Phenomenon: A Criticism and Restatement'', in: Economics of Planning, Vol. 19. 1985.

From the point of view of those waiting in line, such goods were in perpetual \"short supply\"; some of them were willing and able to pay more than the official price ceiling, but were legally prohibited from doing so. This method for determining the allocation of goods in short supply is known as \"[[rationing]]\".\n* From the mid-2000s through the 2010s, [[shortages in Venezuela]] occurred, due to the Venezuelan government's economic policies;<ref>{{Cite news|title = Venezuela seizes warehouses packed with medical goods, food|url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy-idUSKCN0ID00A20141024|newspaper = Reuters|date = 2014-10-24|access-date = 2015-12-07}}</ref> such as relying on foreign imports while creating strict [[foreign exchange controls]], put price controls in place and having [[expropriation]]s result with lower domestic production.

For instance, a shortage of food can just as well be called a longage of people ([[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]). By looking at it from this view, he felt the problem could be better dealt with.<ref>[http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/videos/video_803_segment5.html Video Interview with Garrett Hardin: Longages and Overpopulation Predictions] Educational Communications program 803, 1990</ref>\n\n==Labour shortage==\n{{Further|Labour economics}}\n\nIn its narrowest definition, a labour shortage is an [[economics|economic condition]] in which employers believe there are insufficient qualified candidates (employees) to fill the [[demand|marketplace demands]] for [[employment]] at a wage that is mostly employer-determined. Such a condition is sometimes referred to by [[economist]]s as \"an insufficiency in the [[labour force]].\" An [[Aging in the American workforce|ageing population and a contracting workforce]] and a [[birth dearth]] may curb U.S. economic expansion for several decades, for example.<ref>[http://washingtonexaminer.com/news/business/2011/08/shrinking-labor-force-may-curb-us-expansion-two-decades Shrinking labour force may curb U.S. expansion for two decades]</ref>\n\n===Wage factors===\n[[Wage|Wage levels]] have been suggested as one way to measure a labour shortage. However, that often does not match people's common perceptions. For example, if wages alone are the best measure of labour shortages, then that would imply that doctors, instead of farm workers, should be imported because doctors are far more expensive than farm workers. However, there are institutionally-imposed limits on the number of doctors that are allowed to be licensed.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} If foreign migrant workers were not allowed into a nation, farm wages may go up but probably not enough to approach the wages of doctors.\n\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade]] (which originated in the early 17th century but ended by the early 19th century) was said to have originated from perceived shortages of agricultural labour in the [[Americas]] (particularly in the [[Southern United States]]). It was thought that bringing African labor was the only means of [[malaria]] resistance available at the time.<ref>[http://www.malaria.com/blog/american-plasmodium-vivax \"As American as\u2026Plasmodium vivax?\"]</ref> Ironically, malaria seems to itself have been introduced to the \"New World\" via the slave trade.<ref>[http://sciencedude.blog.ocregister.com/2011/12/26/uci-new-world-malaria-linked-to-slave-trade/166005/ \"UCI: New World malaria linked to slave trade.\"]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Aggregate demand]]\n* [[Aggregate supply]]\n* [[Aggregation problem]]\n* [[Eastern Bloc economies]]\n* [[Economic equilibrium#Disequilibrium|Disequilibrium]]\n* [[Economic surplus]]\n* [[Effective demand]]\n* [[Excess demand function]]\n* [[Excess supply]]\n* [[Induced demand]]\n* [[Keynesian formula]]\n* [[Reproduction (economics)|Reproduction]]\n* [[Scarcity]]\n* [[Shortage economy]]\n* [[Supply shock]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n* Kornai, J\u00e1nos, ''Socialist economy'', Princeton University Press, 1992, {{ISBN|0-691-00393-9}}\n* Kornai, J\u00e1nos, ''Economics of Shortage'', Amsterdam: North Holland Press, Volume A, p.&nbsp;27; Volume B, p.&nbsp;196 .\n* [[Stanislaw Gomulka|Gomulka, Stanislaw]]: ''Kornai's Soft Budget Constraint and the Shortage Phenomenon: A Criticism and Restatement'', in: Economics of Planning, Vol. 19. 1985.
