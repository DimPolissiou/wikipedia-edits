Dunsmuir, who came to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1878 to manage the family business, intended the house to be a wedding gift for his new bride but didn't get to live in it with her as he fell ill and died while on his honeymoon in New York.

He is best known for his work with [[Peanut Butter Wolf]]; the two artists formed a duo after meeting in 1990. Their musical partnership was cut short following Charizma's murder in 1993.\n\n==Biography==\nCharizma was 13 when he started rapping at high school talent shows. He was 16 when he met 19-year-old Chris Manak, also known as Peanut Butter Wolf, in 1990. They became best friends, recording several demos and performing live in the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] area. After hearing Charizma on [[San Jose State]]'s [[KSJS]] 90.5 FM, Matt Brown approached Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf, offering to become their manager. Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf agreed and began looking for a [[record label]]. After entertaining offers from some major record labels, including [[Columbia Records]], they signed with the [[Disney]]-owned record label Hollywood Basic, now [[Hollywood Records]].\n\nWhile signed to Hollywood Basic, Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf recorded several tracks but Hollywood Basic did not release an album due to creative differences between the artists and the label. Charizma stated, \"The stuff we wanted to do was not what Hollywood wanted. When we first got signed they kept asking us for more and more songs. After we got signed they were turning things down left and right. They were talking about bringing outside producers\u2014but [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] never had outside producers, [[Gang Starr]] never did.

He is best known for his work with [[Peanut Butter Wolf]]; the two artists formed a duo after meeting in 1990. Their musical partnership was cut short following Charizma's murder in 1993.\n\n==Biography==\nCharizma was 13 when he started rapping at high school talent shows. He was 16 when he met 19-year-old Chris Manak, also known as Peanut Butter Wolf, in 1990. They became best friends, recording several demos and performing live in the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] area. After hearing Charizma on [[San Jose State]]'s [[KSJS]] 90.5 FM, Matt Brown approached Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf, offering to become their manager. Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf agreed and began looking for a [[record label]]. After entertaining offers from some major record labels, including [[Columbia Records]], they signed with the [[Disney]]-owned record label Hollywood Basic, now [[Hollywood Records]].\n\nWhile signed to Hollywood Basic, Charizma and Peanut Butter Wolf recorded several tracks but Hollywood Basic did not release an album due to creative differences between the artists and the label. Charizma stated, \"The stuff we wanted to do was not what Hollywood wanted. When we first got signed they kept asking us for more and more songs. After we got signed they were turning things down left and right. They were talking about bringing outside producers\u2014but [[Pete Rock & CL Smooth]] never had outside producers, [[Gang Starr]] never did. It's like they almost liked the image [of us] more.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2004/02/charizma-peanut-butter-wolf-in-elemental |title=Charizma & Peanut Butter Wolf In Elemental, February 2nd, 2004}}</ref> Only a promotional cassette with the single \"Red Light, Green Light\" and a [[flexi disc]] with the single \"Jack the Mack\" that was featured in an issue of the Bay area hip hop [[zine]] ''Bomb Magazine'' were released while signed to Hollywood Basic.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nDespite not having released an album, the duo gained a following. They routinely performed live in the [[Bay area]], toured Germany with label mates [[Raw Fusion]] and were featured in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' magazine]].

As of 2005, Sana'a University was composed of twenty faculties with 12 faculties at the main campus of Sanaa and eight others at different branches throughout the country.\n\nThe university started postgraduate studies at the start of the 1980s. <ref>{{cite web |title=Sanaa University About Page |url=https://www.su.edu.ye/Home/Article/10 |website=Sanaa University (Arabic) |accessdate=28 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Faculties==\n{{Div col}} \n* Faculty Of Engineering\n* Faculty Of Computer & Information Technology\n* Faculty Of Commerce & Economics\n* Faculty Of Medicine\n* Faculty Of Dentistry\n* Faculty Of Pharmacy\n* Faculty Of Science\n* Faculty Of Agriculture\n* Faculty Of Law & Legislation\n* Faculty Of Education\n* Faculty Of Art\n* Faculty Of Languages - ru\n* Faculty Of Publication\n\n {{Div col end}}\n\n==Notable faculty==\n*Nasser al-Aulaqi, Yemeni Agriculture Minister and president of Sanaa University.<ref name=rag>{{Cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/09/AR2009120904422.html|last=Raghavan|first=Sudarsan|date=December 10, 2009|title=Cleric linked to Fort Hood attack grew more radicalized in Yemen|newspaper=Washington Post|accessdate=December 10, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"nytimes homegrown\">{{Cite news|last=Shane|first=Scott|date=November 18, 2009|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/19/us/19awlaki.html|title=Born in U.S., a Radical Cleric Inspires Terror|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=November 20, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Holmes |first=Oliver |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2030277,00.html |title=Why Yemen Hasn't Arrested Terrorist Cleric Anwar al-Awlaki |publisher=TIME |date=November 5, 2009 |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"csmonitor1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2010/0831/Anwar-al-Awlaki-ACLU-wants-militant-cleric-taken-off-US-kill-list|author=Warren Richey |title=Anwar al-Awlaki: ACLU wants militant cleric taken off US 'kill list' |publisher=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=August 31, 2010 |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"UPI\">{{Cite news|title=Imam in Fort Hood case born in New Mexico |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2009/11/11/Imam-in-Fort-Hood-case-born-in-New-Mexico/UPI-43701257982479/ |agency=[[United Press International]] |author=UPI staff reporter|date=November 11, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n*[[Hamid al-Ahmar]], politician\n*[[Yahya Al-Mutawakel]], Minister of Industry and Trade\n*[[Hoda Ablan]], poet\n*[[Abdulla A.

Between 10 and 15 February 1814, the French inflicted losses of at least 14,034 men and 52 guns on the Army of Silesia. A second estimate listed 16,000 casualties and 60 guns. A third estimate reached as high as 20,000 casualties, but a calculation by historian [[George Nafziger]] suggested that Bl\u00fccher may have lost 28,500 soldiers.{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|pp=168\u2013169}} \n\nAfter their victory over [[Napoleon]] in the [[Battle of La Rothi\u00e8re]] on 1 February 1814, the two main Allied armies separated. Austrian [[Field Marshal]] [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg]]'s Army of Bohemia marched west toward [[Troyes]] while Bl\u00fccher's Army of Silesia moved north to [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur Marne]] and turned west along the [[Marne (river)|Marne River]], aiming for [[Meaux]].{{sfn|Petre|1994|p=43}} Leaving 39,000 troops to watch the cautious Schwarzenberg, Napoleon assembled a strike force of 20,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry to deal with the more aggressive Bl\u00fccher.{{sfn|Petre|1994|pp=52\u201353}} By the evening of 8 February, the Army of Silesia was spread along a line of march {{convert|44|mi|km|0}} long. [[Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken]]'s 20,000 Russians led the column, followed by [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg]]'s 18,000 Prussians, [[Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev]]'s 4,000 Russians, [[Peter Mikhailovich Kaptzevich]]'s Russians and [[Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf]]'s Prussians, the last two forces totaling 15,000 men.{{sfn|Petre|1994|pp=55\u201357}}\n\n==Organization==\n===Russian===\nThe Russian forces were organized into [[army corps]] with infantry corps and cavalry corps subordinated to it. The full structure can be seen in the ''Sacken's Russian order of battle'' section.{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|pp=601\u2013602}} The Russian IX Infantry Corps, as shown in the ''Olsufiev's Russian order of battle'' section, and the Russian X Corps, as shown in the ''Kaptzevich's Russian order of battle'' section, both reported to their superior, General-Leutnant [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron]].{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|p=552}} Since Langeron did not appear in the theater of operations until late February, they temporarily reported directly to Bl\u00fccher.{{sfn|Petre|1994|p=105}}\n\nIn the Russian army, artillery batteries were organized with 12 pieces each. In 1805, [[Aleksey Arakcheyev]] introduced a new range of field artillery that consisted of 6- and 12-pounder cannons and 10- and 20-pounder [[licorne]]s, a gun similar to a [[howitzer]].{{sfn|Rothenberg|1980|pp=201\u2013201}} An Allied order of battle from 1 January 1814 noted that Light Batteries were armed with 6-pounders. The same list stated that of five Position Batteries in one army corps, three had 12 guns, one had 11 guns, and one had seven guns.{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|p=554}} In the Russian 3rd Dragoon Division, Horse Battery Nr. 18 was armed with only 10 guns, but usually the specific number of guns in a battery was not stated.{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|p=551}}\n\n===Prussian===\nWhen the Prussian army was rebuilt after the disastrous [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], its reduced establishment did not allow for the formation of divisions. Therefore, the next tactical unit below corps level became the brigade, which included both cavalry and artillery. Batteries were formed from six 6- or 12-pounder cannons and two 7- or 10-pounder howitzers. Artillery batteries that were not assigned to the brigades were posted to the corps reserve.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1980|p=193}} By 1813, each corps incorporated four brigades and included a mix of regular and [[Landwehr]] units.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1980|p=195}}\n\n===French===\nA French order of battle from 6 January 1814 showed 10 Young Guard Foot Artillery and one Old Guard Foot Artillery companies each armed with six 6-pounder guns and two howitzers. There were four Old Guard Foot Artillery companies armed with six 12-pounder guns and two howitzers. Six Old Guard Horse Artillery companies were each armed with four 6-pounder guns and two howitzers.{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|p=527}} Eight guns per foot artillery company and six guns per horse artillery company represented the standard French organization.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1980|p=143}} However, at the Battle of La Rothi\u00e8re on 1 February, the Allies captured 50\u201360 French guns. Which artillery companies lost guns was not stated.{{sfn|Petre|1994|p=37}}\n\n==[[Battle of Champaubert]]==\nNapoleon with 30,000 men and 120 guns surprised Olsufiev south of [[Champaubert]] on the morning of 10 February. Unwisely, Olsufiev decided to fight it out, hoping for help from Bl\u00fccher. By 3:00 pm the Russians were forced back through Champaubert. Too late, Olsufiev tried to retreat east to [[\u00c9toges]], but found both flanks enveloped by French cavalry. Olsufiev lost as many as 4,000 men out of 5,000 troops,{{sfn|Chandler|1979|p=87}} or as few as 2,400 and nine guns out of a total of 3,700 men and 24 guns.

When the Allied [[rearguard]] tried to hold off the French pursuit, Marshal Ney scattered the cavalry protecting the Allied left flank. The Prussian infantry escaped across the [[Marne (river)|Marne River]], but the French trapped a Russian brigade on the right flank and forced it to surrender. For the loss of 600 killed and wounded, the French inflicted 1,250 casualties on the Prussians and 1,500 casualties on the Russians. The French captured nine guns and many wagons. The Allies retreated to [[Fismes]] while the French repaired the broken bridge.{{sfn|Chandler|1979|pp=90\u201391}} The next day, Marshal Mortier led the pursuit with the divisions of Christiani, Colbert, and Defrance.

Bl\u00fccher decided to retreat after seeing the French cavalry defeat the Allied cavalry and discovering that he was facing Napoleon in person. The 25,000 French enjoyed a numerical advantage over the 20,000 Allied soldiers.

Between 10 and 15 February 1814, the French inflicted losses of at least 14,034 men and 52 guns on the Army of Silesia. A second estimate listed 16,000 casualties and 60 guns. A third estimate reached as high as 20,000 casualties, but a calculation by historian [[George Nafziger]] suggested that Bl\u00fccher may have lost 28,500 soldiers.{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|pp=168\u2013169}} \n\nAfter their victory over [[Napoleon]] in the [[Battle of La Rothi\u00e8re]] on 1 February 1814, the two main Allied armies separated. Austrian [[Field Marshal]] [[Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg]]'s Army of Bohemia marched west toward [[Troyes]] while Bl\u00fccher's Army of Silesia moved north to [[Ch\u00e2lons-sur Marne]] and turned west along the [[Marne (river)|Marne River]], aiming for [[Meaux]].{{sfn|Petre|1994|p=43}} Leaving 39,000 troops to watch the cautious Schwarzenberg, Napoleon assembled a strike force of 20,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry to deal with the more aggressive Bl\u00fccher.{{sfn|Petre|1994|pp=52\u201353}} By the evening of 8 February, the Army of Silesia was spread along a line of march {{convert|44|mi|km|0}} long. [[Fabian Gottlieb von Osten-Sacken]]'s 20,000 Russians led the column, followed by [[Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg]]'s 18,000 Prussians, [[Zakhar Dmitrievich Olsufiev]]'s 4,000 Russians, [[Peter Mikhailovich Kaptzevich]]'s Russians and [[Friedrich Graf Kleist von Nollendorf]]'s Prussians, the last two forces totaling 15,000 men.{{sfn|Petre|1994|pp=55\u201357}}\n\n==Organization==\n===Russian===\nThe Russian forces were organized into [[army corps]] with infantry corps and cavalry corps subordinated to it. The full structure can be seen in the ''Sacken's Russian order of battle'' section.{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|pp=601\u2013602}} The Russian IX Infantry Corps, as shown in the ''Olsufiev's Russian order of battle'' section, and the Russian X Corps, as shown in the ''Kaptzevich's Russian order of battle'' section, both reported to their superior, General-Leutnant [[Louis Alexandre Andrault de Langeron]].{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|p=552}} Since Langeron did not appear in the theater of operations until late February, they temporarily reported directly to Bl\u00fccher.{{sfn|Petre|1994|p=105}}\n\nIn the Russian army, artillery batteries were organized with 12 pieces each. In 1805, [[Aleksey Arakcheyev]] introduced a new range of field artillery that consisted of 6- and 12-pounder cannons and 10- and 20-pounder [[licorne]]s, a gun similar to a [[howitzer]].{{sfn|Rothenberg|1980|pp=201\u2013201}} An Allied order of battle from 1 January 1814 noted that Light Batteries were armed with 6-pounders. The same list stated that of five Position Batteries in one army corps, three had 12 guns, one had 11 guns, and one had seven guns.{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|p=554}} In the Russian 3rd Dragoon Division, Horse Battery Nr. 18 was armed with only 10 guns, but usually the specific number of guns in a battery was not stated.{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|p=551}}\n\n===Prussian===\nWhen the Prussian army was rebuilt after the disastrous [[War of the Fourth Coalition]], its reduced establishment did not allow for the formation of divisions. Therefore, the next tactical unit below corps level became the brigade, which included both cavalry and artillery. Batteries were formed from six 6- or 12-pounder cannons and two 7- or 10-pounder howitzers. Artillery batteries that were not assigned to the brigades were posted to the corps reserve.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1980|p=193}} By 1813, each corps incorporated four brigades and included a mix of regular and [[Landwehr]] units.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1980|p=195}}\n\n===French===\nA French order of battle from 6 January 1814 showed 10 Young Guard Foot Artillery and one Old Guard Foot Artillery companies each armed with six 6-pounder guns and two howitzers. There were four Old Guard Foot Artillery companies armed with six 12-pounder guns and two howitzers. Six Old Guard Horse Artillery companies were each armed with four 6-pounder guns and two howitzers.{{sfn|Nafziger|2015|p=527}} Eight guns per foot artillery company and six guns per horse artillery company represented the standard French organization.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1980|p=143}} However, at the Battle of La Rothi\u00e8re on 1 February, the Allies captured 50\u201360 French guns. Which artillery companies lost guns was not stated.{{sfn|Petre|1994|p=37}}\n\n==[[Battle of Champaubert]]==\nNapoleon with 30,000 men and 120 guns surprised Olsufiev south of [[Champaubert]] on the morning of 10 February. Unwisely, Olsufiev decided to fight it out, hoping for help from Bl\u00fccher. By 3:00 pm the Russians were forced back through Champaubert. Too late, Olsufiev tried to retreat east to [[\u00c9toges]], but found both flanks enveloped by French cavalry.

The Prussian infantry escaped across the [[Marne (river)|Marne River]], but the French trapped a Russian brigade on the right flank and forced it to surrender. For the loss of 600 killed and wounded, the French inflicted 1,250 casualties on the Prussians and 1,500 casualties on the Russians. The French captured nine guns and many wagons. The Allies retreated to [[Fismes]] while the French repaired the broken bridge.{{sfn|Chandler|1979|pp=90\u201391}} The next day, Marshal Mortier led the pursuit with the divisions of Christiani, Colbert, and Defrance.

It stars [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Uma Thurman]], with [[Jude Law]], [[Loren Dean]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Gore Vidal]], and [[Alan Arkin]] appearing in supporting roles.<ref name=challenging/> The film presents a [[biopunk]] vision of a future society driven by [[eugenics]] where potential children are conceived through genetic selection to ensure they possess the best hereditary traits of their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://neuroethics.upenn.edu/resources/narrative-perspectives-neuroethics-in-books-and-film/ |title=NEUROETHICS &#124; The Narrative Perspectives |publisher=Neuroethics.upenn.edu |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref> The film centers on Vincent Freeman, played by Hawke, who was conceived outside the eugenics program and struggles to overcome [[genetic discrimination]] to realize his dream of going into space.\n\nThe film draws on concerns over [[reproductive technologies]] that facilitate eugenics, and the possible consequences of such technological developments for society. It also explores the idea of [[destiny]] and the ways in which it can and does govern lives. Characters in ''Gattaca'' continually battle both with society and with themselves to find their place in the world and who they are destined to be according to their genes.\n\nThe film's title is based on the letters G, A, T, and C, which stand for [[guanine]], [[adenine]], [[thymine]], and [[cytosine]], the four [[nucleobases]] of [[DNA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/science/11gene.html |title=Now: The Rest of the Genome |first=Carl |last=Zimmer |date=November 10, 2008 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> It was a 1997 nominee for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the future, [[eugenics]] is common. A genetic registry database uses [[biometrics]] to classify those so created as \"valids\" while those conceived by traditional means and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as \"in-valids\". [[Genetic discrimination]] is illegal, but in practice [[genotype]] profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs.\n\nVincent Freeman is conceived without the aid of genetic selection; his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection in conceiving their next child, Anton. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of \"[[Chicken (game)|chicken]]\" by swimming out to sea as far as they can, with the first one returning to shore considered the loser. Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel but is reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day, Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after, Vincent leaves home.\n\nYears later, Vincent works as an in-valid, cleaning office spaces including that of Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, a spaceflight conglomerate. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using hair, skin, blood and urine samples from a donor, Jerome Eugene Morrow, who is a former swimming star paralyzed due to a car accident. With Jerome's genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca, and is assigned to be navigator for an upcoming trip to Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. To keep his identity hidden, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material and pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples.\n\nGattaca becomes embroiled in controversy when one of its administrators is murdered a week before the flight. The police find a fallen eyelash of Vincent's at the scene. An investigation is launched to find the murderer, Vincent being the top suspect. Through this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will prevent her from joining any deep space Gattaca mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is by his own hand; after coming in second place in a swim meet, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet wasn't, and that is the source of his suffering.\n\nVincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally, it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director was the killer, with the administrator's threats to cancel the mission as a motive. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton, who in turn has become aware of Vincent's presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent that what he is doing is illegal, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to one more game of chicken. As the two swim out in the dead of night, Anton expresses surprise at Vincent's stamina, so Vincent reveals that his strategy for winning was not to save energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them both back to shore using [[celestial navigation]].\n\nOn the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return, and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, the person in charge of background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, genetically selected but \"not all that they promised\", could break the limits just as Vincent has.

As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and [[Self-immolation|immolates]] himself in his home's incinerator; Vincent opens the note from Jerome to find only a lock of Jerome's hair attached to it.

It stars [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Uma Thurman]], with [[Jude Law]], [[Loren Dean]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Gore Vidal]], and [[Alan Arkin]] appearing in supporting roles.<ref name=challenging/> The film presents a [[biopunk]] vision of a future society driven by [[eugenics]] where potential children are conceived through genetic selection to ensure they possess the best hereditary traits of their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://neuroethics.upenn.edu/resources/narrative-perspectives-neuroethics-in-books-and-film/ |title=NEUROETHICS &#124; The Narrative Perspectives |publisher=Neuroethics.upenn.edu |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref> The film centers on Vincent Freeman, played by Hawke, who was conceived outside the eugenics program and struggles to overcome [[genetic discrimination]] to realize his dream of going into space.\n\nThe film draws on concerns over [[reproductive technologies]] that facilitate eugenics, and the possible consequences of such technological developments for society. It also explores the idea of [[destiny]] and the ways in which it can and does govern lives. Characters in ''Gattaca'' continually battle both with society and with themselves to find their place in the world and who they are destined to be according to their genes.\n\nThe film's title is based on the letters G, A, T, and C, which stand for [[guanine]], [[adenine]], [[thymine]], and [[cytosine]], the four [[nucleobases]] of [[DNA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/science/11gene.html |title=Now: The Rest of the Genome |first=Carl |last=Zimmer |date=November 10, 2008 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> It was a 1997 nominee for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the future, [[eugenics]] is common. A genetic registry database uses [[biometrics]] to classify those so created as \"valids\" while those conceived by traditional means and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as \"in-valids\". [[Genetic discrimination]] is illegal, but in practice [[genotype]] profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs.\n\nVincent Freeman is conceived without the aid of genetic selection; his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection in conceiving their next child, Anton. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of \"[[Chicken (game)|chicken]]\" by swimming out to sea as far as they can, with the first one returning to shore considered the loser. Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel but is reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day, Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after, Vincent leaves home.\n\nYears later, Vincent works as an in-valid, cleaning office spaces including that of Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, a spaceflight conglomerate. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using hair, skin, blood and urine samples from a donor, Jerome Eugene Morrow, who is a former swimming star paralyzed due to a car accident. With Jerome's genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca, and is assigned to be navigator for an upcoming trip to Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. To keep his identity hidden, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material and pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples.\n\nGattaca becomes embroiled in controversy when one of its administrators is murdered a week before the flight. The police find a fallen eyelash of Vincent's at the scene. An investigation is launched to find the murderer, Vincent being the top suspect. Through this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will prevent her from joining any deep space Gattaca mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is by his own hand; after coming in second place in a swim meet, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet wasn't, and that is the source of his suffering.\n\nVincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally, it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director was the killer, with the administrator's threats to cancel the mission as a motive. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton, who in turn has become aware of Vincent's presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent that what he is doing is illegal, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to one more game of chicken. As the two swim out in the dead of night, Anton expresses surprise at Vincent's stamina, so Vincent reveals that his strategy for winning was not to save energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them both back to shore using [[celestial navigation]].\n\nOn the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return, and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, the person in charge of background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, genetically selected but \"not all that they promised\", could break the limits just as Vincent has. He passes Vincent as a valid. As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and [[Self-immolation|immolates]] himself in his home's incinerator; Vincent opens the note from Jerome to find only a lock of Jerome's hair attached to it. Vincent muses on this, stating \"For someone who was never meant for this world, I must confess, I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it. Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving; maybe I'm going home.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth = 25em}}\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Vincent Freeman, impersonating Jerome Eugene Morrow\n** [[Mason Gamble]] as young Vincent\n** Chad Christ as teenage Vincent\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Irene Cassini\n* [[Jude Law]] as Jerome Eugene Morrow\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Anton Freeman\n** Vincent Nielson as young Anton\n** [[William Lee Scott]] as teenage Anton\n* [[Gore Vidal]] as Director Josef\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Dr. Lamar\n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Marie Freeman\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Antonio Freeman\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Delivery nurse\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Geneticist\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Caesar\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as German\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Detective Hugo\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Cop on the Beat\n* [[Ken Marino]] as Sequencing technician\n* Cynthia Martells as Cavendish\n* [[Gabrielle Reece]] as Gattaca Trainer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2013}}\n[[File:CLA building complex.JPG|thumb|right|[[CLA Building]] complex]]\n[[File:Marin Civic Center interior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marin County Civic Center]]]]\n\n===Filming===\nThe exteriors (including the roof scene) and some of the interior shots of the Gattaca complex were filmed at [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s 1960 [[Marin County Civic Center]] in [[San Rafael, California]].<ref name=sfgate/> The speakers in the complex broadcast announcements both in [[Esperanto]] language and English; Miko Sloper from the [[Esperanto-USA|Esperanto League of North America]] went to the recording studio to handle the Esperanto part.<ref>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tRJF2EhWtz0</ref> The parking lot scenes were shot at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]], distinguished by its punch card-like windows, located near [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. The exterior of Vincent Freeman's house was shot at the [[CLA Building]] on the campus of [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]]. Other exterior shots were filmed at the bottom of the spillway of the [[Sepulveda Dam]] and outside [[The Forum (Inglewood)|The Forum]] in Inglewood. The solar power plant mirrors sequence was filmed at the [[Solar Energy Generating Systems#Kramer Junction|Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station]].\n\n===Design===\nThe movie uses a swimming treadmill in the opening minutes to punctuate the swimming and futuristic themes.<ref name=endless/> The futuristic electric cars<ref>https://www.theavanti.com/gattaca.html</ref> are based on 1960s car models like [[Rover P6]], [[Citro\u00ebn DS19]] and [[Studebaker Avanti]],<ref name=turbinecars/> and futuristic buildings represent [[modern architecture]] of the 1950s.\n\n===Title===\nThe film was shot under the working title ''The Eighth Day'', a reference to the seven days of creation in the Bible. However, by the time its release was scheduled for the fall of 1997, the Belgian film {{lang|fr|Le huiti\u00e8me jour|italic=yes}} had already been released in the US under the title ''[[The Eighth Day (1996 film)|The Eighth Day]]''. As a result, the film was retitled ''Gattaca''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/gattaca-on-hulu/|title=Gattaca on Hulu|work=Slashfilm}}</ref>\n\n=== Title sequence ===\nThe opening title sequence was created by Michael Riley of Shine design studio. It features closeups of body matter (fingernails and hair) hitting the floor accompanied by loud sounds as the objects strike the ground. We later learn that these are the result of Vincent's daily bodily scourings.

On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film received an approval rating of 81% based on 59 reviews, with a rating average of 7.08/10. The site's critical consensus states that \"Intelligent and scientifically provocative, ''Gattaca'' is an absorbing sci-fi drama that poses important interesting ethical questions about the nature of science.\"<ref name=rt/> On [[Metacritic]], the film received \"generally favorable reviews\" with a score of 64 out of 100, based on 20 reviews.<ref name=\"metacritic\"/> [[Roger Ebert]] stated, \"This is one of the smartest and most provocative of science fiction films, a thriller with ideas.\"<ref name=ebert/> [[James Berardinelli]] praised it for \"energy and tautness\" and its \"thought-provoking script and thematic richness.\"<ref name=reelviews/>\n\nAlthough critically acclaimed, ''Gattaca'' was not a box office success, but it is said to have crystallized the debate over the controversial topic of [[human genetic engineering]].<ref name=\"Jabr\" /><ref name=\"darnovsky\" /><ref name=popemcroberts/> The film's [[dystopia]]n depiction of \"[[genoism]]\" has been cited by many [[bioethicist]]s and laypeople in support of their hesitancy about, or opposition to, eugenics and the societal acceptance of the [[genetic determinism|genetic-determinist]] ideology that may frame it.<ref name=\"kirby\" /> In a 1997 review of the film for the journal ''Nature Genetics'', molecular biologist [[Lee M. Silver]] stated that \"''Gattaca'' is a film that all geneticists should see if for no other reason than to understand the perception of our trade held by so many of the public-at-large\".<ref name=\"silver\" />\n\nIn 2004, [[Bioethics|bioethicist]] [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] criticized the premise and influence of the film,<ref name=\"hughes\" /> arguing that:\n# Astronaut-training programs are entirely justified in attempting to screen out people with heart problems for safety reasons;\n# In the United States, people are already screened by insurance companies on the basis of their propensities to disease, for actuarial purposes;\n# Rather than banning genetic testing or genetic enhancement, society should develop [[genetic information privacy]] [[privacy law|laws]] such as the U.S. [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] signed into law on May 21, 2008 that allow justified forms of genetic testing and data aggregation, but forbid those that are judged to result in genetic discrimination. Citizens should then be able to make a complaint to the appropriate authority if they believe they have been discriminated against because of their genotype.\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
