{"title_page": "Battle of Maguelone", "text_new": "The '''Battle of Maguelone''' was a minor naval action that occurred in late October 1809, during the [[Peninsular War]], between the escort of a French convoy, comprising three ships of the line and two frigates, and a 6-ship strong squadron of the Royal Navy. In a running battle, the French covered the retreat of the convoy and attempted to escape by sailing in shallow waters close to the shore of Maguelone. After two of the ships of the line ran aground, their crew evacuated them and scuttled them by fire after removing valuable equipment, including the artillery. The remaining ship and frigates made good their escape.\n\n== Context ==\nOn 21 October 1809, a squadron of the French Navy under Rear-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Baudin]] left Toulon, escorting a convoy bound for [[Barcelona]]. On 23, off [[Cape Saint Sebastian]], the squadron detected five sails in the West. With a light wind from the East, Baudin ordered the convoy to seek shelter in Baie des Roses, and had his forces sail to the open sea. By noon, 14 British ships were in sight. In the night, the weather deteriorated and the ships had to reduce sail, an operation made difficult and longer than usual by the lack of training of the crew. In the morning of 24, the squadron found itself near the coast, and by 7:30, Baudin ordered his ships to anchor. With 16 metres under keel, he signaled his intention to set sail soon and seek refuge off [[S\u00e8te]].<ref group=note>\"S\u00e8te\" was then written \"Cette\".</ref><ref name=Troude56>Troude, p.56</ref>\n\nCollingwood, having had word of the French attempt to resupply their forces in Barcelona, had left [[Cape Sici\u00e9]] with 15 ships of the line and 5 frigates and was ambushing the convoy off Cape Saint Sebastian. Tow frigates were also posted off Toulon to watch the movements of the French ships.<ref name=Troude56 />\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 25 October 1809, the French squadron left their anchorage of Baie des Roses and sailed to the West, close to shore, with light winds from the East. The British resumed their chase, catching up on the French, as the wind was stronger further off at sea. Baudin ordered ''Pauline'' to run to S\u00e8te to warn of the incoming British squadron and have coastal defences manned and ready. At 11:30, the French ships started to touch bottom, and Baudin gave freedom of manoeuver to his captains. ''Bor\u00e9e'' managed to reach deeped waters, but ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' ran aground.<ref name=Troude57>Troude, p.57</ref>\n\n''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' rested on a bed of rock and hard sand, ''Lion'' east of ''Robuste'', both ships out of range of the British. Meanwhile, ''Pauline'' and ''Bor\u00e9e'' came in range and exchanged a few shots with HMS ''Tigre'' and ''Leviathan''. Senez, the captaing of ''Bor\u00e9e'', planned to anchor off S\u00e8te, but Ensign Vallat, captain of the aviso ''Proven\u00e7ale'' that was patrolling the area, offered to pilot ''Bor\u00e9e'' into the harbour. The man\u0153uver succeeded, putting ''Bor\u00e9e'' out of reach of the British squadron. ''Pauline'' mirrored the actions of ''Bor\u00e9e'' and also entered the port.<ref name=Troude57 />\n\nWith the sea growing heavier, the British stayed off Baudin's ships, but ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' were sustaining increasing damage and leaking water.<ref name=Troude57 /> It soon became obvious that the ships could not be raised, and had to be evacuated and scuttled.<ref name=Troude58>Troude, p.58</ref> In the morning of 26, Baudin ordered his crew to abandon ship and set them afire. ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' exploded in the night.<ref name=Troude58 />\n\nOn 1 October, British [[cutting out]] parties from HMS [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']], [[HMS Cumberland (1807)|''Cumberland'']], [[HMS Apollo (1805)|''Apollo'']], [[HMS Topaze (1793)|HMS ''Topaze'']], [[French frigate Volontaire (1796)|''Volontaire'']], [[HMS Scout (1804)|''Scout'']], [[HMS Philomel (1806)|''Philomel'']] and [[French brig Ronco (1808)|''Ronco'']], attacked the convoy anchored at Baie des Roses. <ref name=Troude58 /> The transports were protected by the 18-gun fluyt ''Lamproie'', under Captain Jacques Labretesche, two bombards and a [[xebec]]. Some of the British boats took heavy casualties in the clash. <ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16319|date=29 November 1809|pages=1602\u20131604}}</ref> \nThey captured 3 merchantmen, and set 10 ships on fire, including ''Lamproie''.

In a running battle, the French covered the retreat of the convoy and attempted to escape by sailing in shallow waters close to the shore of Maguelone. After two of the ships of the line ran aground, their crew evacuated them and scuttled them by fire after removing valuable equipment, including the artillery. The remaining ship and frigates made good their escape.\n\n== Context ==\nOn 21 October 1809, a squadron of the French Navy under Rear-Admiral [[Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Baudin]] left Toulon, escorting a convoy bound for [[Barcelona]]. On 23, off [[Cape Saint Sebastian]], the squadron detected five sails in the West. With a light wind from the East, Baudin ordered the convoy to seek shelter in Baie des Roses, and had his forces sail to the open sea. By noon, 14 British ships were in sight. In the night, the weather deteriorated and the ships had to reduce sail, an operation made difficult and longer than usual by the lack of training of the crew. In the morning of 24, the squadron found itself near the coast, and by 7:30, Baudin ordered his ships to anchor. With 16 metres under keel, he signaled his intention to set sail soon and seek refuge off [[S\u00e8te]].<ref group=note>\"S\u00e8te\" was then written \"Cette\".</ref><ref name=Troude56>Troude, p.56</ref>\n\nCollingwood, having had word of the French attempt to resupply their forces in Barcelona, had left [[Cape Sici\u00e9]] with 15 ships of the line and 5 frigates and was ambushing the convoy off Cape Saint Sebastian. Tow frigates were also posted off Toulon to watch the movements of the French ships.<ref name=Troude56 />\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 25 October 1809, the French squadron left their anchorage of Baie des Roses and sailed to the West, close to shore, with light winds from the East. The British resumed their chase, catching up on the French, as the wind was stronger further off at sea. Baudin ordered ''Pauline'' to run to S\u00e8te to warn of the incoming British squadron and have coastal defences manned and ready. At 11:30, the French ships started to touch bottom, and Baudin gave freedom of manoeuver to his captains. ''Bor\u00e9e'' managed to reach deeped waters, but ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' ran aground.<ref name=Troude57>Troude, p.57</ref>\n\n''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' rested on a bed of rock and hard sand, ''Lion'' east of ''Robuste'', both ships out of range of the British. Meanwhile, ''Pauline'' and ''Bor\u00e9e'' came in range and exchanged a few shots with HMS ''Tigre'' and ''Leviathan''. Senez, the captaing of ''Bor\u00e9e'', planned to anchor off S\u00e8te, but Ensign Vallat, captain of the aviso ''Proven\u00e7ale'' that was patrolling the area, offered to pilot ''Bor\u00e9e'' into the harbour. The man\u0153uver succeeded, putting ''Bor\u00e9e'' out of reach of the British squadron. ''Pauline'' mirrored the actions of ''Bor\u00e9e'' and also entered the port.<ref name=Troude57 />\n\nWith the sea growing heavier, the British stayed off Baudin's ships, but ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' were sustaining increasing damage and leaking water.<ref name=Troude57 /> It soon became obvious that the ships could not be raised, and had to be evacuated and scuttled.<ref name=Troude58>Troude, p.58</ref> In the morning of 26, Baudin ordered his crew to abandon ship and set them afire. ''Robuste'' and ''Lion'' exploded in the night.<ref name=Troude58 />\n\nOn 1 October, British [[cutting out]] parties from HMS [[French ship Tigre (1793)|''Tigre'']], [[HMS Cumberland (1807)|''Cumberland'']], [[HMS Apollo (1805)|''Apollo'']], [[HMS Topaze (1793)|HMS ''Topaze'']], [[French frigate Volontaire (1796)|''Volontaire'']], [[HMS Scout (1804)|''Scout'']], [[HMS Philomel (1806)|''Philomel'']] and [[French brig Ronco (1808)|''Ronco'']], attacked the convoy anchored at Baie des Roses. <ref name=Troude58 /> The transports were protected by the 18-gun fluyt ''Lamproie'', under Captain Jacques Labretesche, two bombards and a [[xebec]]. Some of the British boats took heavy casualties in the clash. <ref>{{London Gazette|issue=16319|date=29 November 1809|pages=1602\u20131604}}</ref> \nThey captured 3 merchantmen, and set 10 ships on fire, including ''Lamproie''. The aviso ''Victoire'', under Garibou, resisted three boarding attempts.<ref name=Troude58 />\n\n== Aftermath ==\n''Am\u00e9lie'', having broken her [[bowsprit]], escaped to Marseille. returned to Toulon on 3 November. ''Bor\u00e9e'' and ''Pauline'' arrived at Toulon on 19.<ref name=Troude58 />\n\nIn January 1813 prize money was awarded to the British vessels that took part in the action for the capture of the ships of war ''Gromlire'' and ''Normande'', and of the transports ''Dragon'' and ''Indien''. A court declared {{HMS|Invincible|1808|2}} a joint captor. Head money was also paid for ''Grondire'' and ''Normande'' and for the destruction of ''Lamproie'' and ''Victoire''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue =16698|date=26 January 1813|page=208}}</ref> In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the Naval General Service Medal with clasp \"1 Nov.
