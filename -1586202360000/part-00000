{"title_page": "Modern gold dinar", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=October 2009}}\n\nThe modern '''Islamic gold dinar''' (sometimes referred as '''Islamic dinar''' or '''Gold dinar''') is a projected [[bullion]] [[gold coin]], so far not issued as official [[currency]] by any national state.  It aims to revive the historical [[gold dinar]] which was a leading coin of early Islam. The currency might consist of minted [[gold coin]]s ([[dinar]]s) or of [[silver coin]]s ([[dirham]]s).\n\n==Dinar history==\n{{Main|Gold Dinar}}\n[[File:Dinar of Abd al-Malik, AH 75.jpg|thumb|[[Gold dinar]] of [[Abd al-Malik]], AH 75, [[Umayyad Caliphate]].]]\n\nAccording to Islamic law, the Islamic dinar is a coin of pure [[gold]] weighing 72 grains of average [[barley]]. Modern determinations of weight for the \"full solidus\" weigh 4.44 grams at the time of Heraclius and a \"light solidus\" equivalent to the weight of the [[mithqal]] weighing 4.25 grams. With the silver Dirham being created to the weight ratio of 7:10, yielded coins of 2.975 grams of pure silver.\n\n[[Umar|Umar Ibn al-Khattab]] established the known standard relationship between them based on their weights: 7 dinars must be equivalent (in weight) to 10 dirhams.\n\n{{cquote|The Revelation undertook to mention them and attached many judgements to them, for example ''[[zakat]]'', marriage, and ''[[hudud]]'', etc., therefore within the Revelation they have to have a reality and specific measure for assessment of zakat, etc. upon which its judgements may be based rather than on the non-shari'i other coins.<br /> <br />Know that there is [[Ijma|consensus]] since the beginning of Islam and the age of the Companions and the Followers that the dirham of the shari'ah is that of which ten weigh seven [[Mithqal]]s weight of the dinar of gold... The weight of a [[Mithqal]] of gold is seventy-two grains of barley, so that the dirham which is seven-tenths of it is fifty and two-fifths grains. All these measurements are firmly established by consensus. |[[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Muqaddimah|Al-Muqaddimah]]<ref>[http://www.muslimphilosophy.com/ik/Muqaddimah/Chapter3/Ch_3_34.htm Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah'', ch. 3 pt. 34]</ref>}}\n\n==Value and denomination==\nPer the historical law stated above, one dinar is 4.25&nbsp;grams of pure gold, and a smaller denomination, the daniq, one sixth of that.

It is not a law to be proved by exceptions, for it knows no exception.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Horace |last=Mann |title=A Few Thoughts for a Young Man: A Lecture, Delivered Before the Boston Mercantile Library Association, on Its 29th Anniversary |year=1853 |page=9}}</ref> He served in the Massachusetts State legislature  (1827\u20131837).

From September 1852 to his death, he served as President of [[Antioch College]].\n\nAbout Mann's intellectual progressivism, the historian [[Ellwood P.

On entering on his duties, he withdrew from all other professional or business engagements and from politics.\n\nHe held this position, and worked with a remarkable intensity, holding teachers' conventions, delivering numerous lectures and addresses, carrying on an extensive correspondence, and introducing numerous reforms. Mann persuaded his fellow modernizers, especially those in the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], to legislate tax-supported elementary public education in their states and to feminize the teaching force. Most northern states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for \"[[normal schools]]\" to train professional teachers.<ref name=\"Mark Groen 1854, pp 251\u2013260\" />\n\nMann traveled to every school in the state so he could physically examine each school ground.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He planned and inaugurated the Massachusetts [[normal school]] system in [[Framingham State College|Lexington]] (which shortly thereafter moved to Framingham), [[Westfield State College|Barre]] (which shortly thereafter moved to Westfield) and [[Bridgewater State College|Bridgewater]], and began preparing a series of annual reports, which had a wide circulation and were considered as being \"among the best expositions, if, indeed, they are not the very best ones, of the practical benefits of a common school education both to the individual and to the state\".<ref name=\"hinsdale\">Hinsdale (1898).</ref> By his advocacy of the disuse of corporal punishment in school discipline, he was involved in a controversy with some of the Boston teachers that resulted in the adoption of his views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&psid=3535 |title=The Struggle for Public Schools |work=Digital History |last1=Mintz |first1=S. |last2=McNeil |first2=S. |year=2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1838, he founded and edited ''The Common School Journal''. In this journal, Mann targeted the public school and its problems. His six main principles were:\n\n# the public should no longer remain ignorant; \n# that such education should be paid for, controlled, and sustained by an interested public; \n# that this education will be best provided in schools that embrace children from a variety of backgrounds; \n# that this education must be [[non-sectarian]]; \n# that this education must be taught using the tenets of a [[free society]]; and \n# that education should be provided by well-trained, professional teachers.\n\nUnder the auspices of the board, but at his own expense, he went to Europe in 1843 to visit schools, especially in [[Prussia]], and his seventh annual report, published after his return, embodied the results of his tour. Many editions of this report were printed, not only in Massachusetts but in other states, in some cases by private individuals and in others by legislatures; several editions were issued in England. Mann hoped that by bringing all children of all classes together, they could have a common learning experience. This would also give an opportunity to the less fortunate to advance in the social scale and education would \"equalize the conditions of men.\" Moreover, it was viewed also as a road to social advancement by the early labor movement and as a goal of having common schools. Mann also suggested that by having schools it would help those students who did not have appropriate discipline in the home. Building a person's character was just as important as reading, writing and arithmetic. Instilling values such as obedience to authority, promptness in attendance, and organizing the time according to bell ringing helped students prepare for future employment. Mann faced some resistance from parents who did not want to give up the moral education to teachers and bureaucrats. The normal schools trained mostly women, giving them new career opportunities as teachers.<ref>{{cite book |first=Linda |last=Eisenmann |title=Historical dictionary of women's education in the United States |year=1988 |page=259}}</ref> Mann believed that women were better suited for teaching, regardless of their status as a mother, and used his position to push for a [[Feminisation of the workplace|feminization]] of the profession.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motherteacher : the feminization of American education|last=S.|first=Sugg, Redding|date=1978|publisher=University Press of Virginia|isbn=0813907578|location=Charlottesville|oclc=3708082}}</ref>\n\nThe practical result of Mann's work was a revolution in the approach used in the common school system of Massachusetts, which in turn influenced the direction of other states. In carrying out his work, Mann met with bitter opposition by some Boston schoolmasters who strongly disapproved of his innovative pedagogical ideas,<ref>{{cite book |first= Myra |last= Glenn |title= Campaigns Against Corporal Punishment |year= 1984 |isbn= 0-87395-813-6 |pages= 104\u20136}}</ref> and by various religious sectarians, who contended against the exclusion of all sectarian instruction from the schools.\n\n===Secular nature===\nAs the ''Old Deluder Satan Act'' and other [[Massachusetts School Laws]] attest, early education in Massachusetts had a clear religious intent. However, by the time of Mann's leadership in education, various developments (including a vibrant populist Protestant faith and increased religious diversity) fostered a secular school system with a religiously passive stance.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Stephen V. |last1=Monsma |first2=J.

But here it stops, not because it claims to have compassed all truth; but because it disclaims to act as an umpire between hostile religious opinions.\"\n\nMann stated that this position resulted in a near-universal use of the Bible in the schools of Massachusetts and that this served as an argument against the assertion by some that Christianity was excluded from his schools, or that they were anti-Christian.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eURNAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA117&dq=inculcates+all+Christian+morals;+it+founds+its+morals+on+the+basis+of+religion |last=Mann |first=Horace |title=Twelfth Annual Report for 1848 of the Secretary of the Board of Education of Massachusetts |pages=116, 177, 121, 122|year=1849 }}</ref> A devotee of [[phrenology]], Mann believed education could eliminate or reduce human failings and compensate for any biological flaws.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The teacher wars : a history of America's most embattled profession|last=Dana.|first=Goldstein|isbn=9780345803627|edition= First Anchor books |location=New York|oclc=895117195|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\nMann also once stated that \"it may not be easy theoretically, to draw the line between those views of religious truth and of Christian faith which is common to all, and may, therefore, with propriety be inculcated in schools, and those which, being peculiar to individual sects, are therefore by law excluded; still it is believed that no practical difficulty occurs in the conduct of our schools in this regard.\"\n\nRather than sanctioning a particular church as was often the norm in many states, the Legislature proscribed books \"calculated to favor the tenets of any particular set of Christians.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9S4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA14&dq=may+not+be+easy+theoretically,+to+draw+the+line+between+those+views+of+religious+truth+and+of+Christian+faith+which+is+common+to+all,+and+may,+therefore,+with+propriety+be+inculcated+in+schools,+and+those+which,+being+peculiar+to+individual+sects,+are+therefore+by+law+excluded;+still+it+is+believed+that+no+practical+difficulty+occurs+in+the+conduct+of+our+schools+in+this+regard |author=Massachusetts Board of Education |title=Annual Report of the Board of Education |origyear=Covering the year 1837 |pages=14, 15|year=1838 }}</ref>\n\n==U.S. Congress==\nIn the spring of 1848 he was elected to the [[United States Congress]] as a [[Whig party (United States)|Whig]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[John Quincy Adams]].

Failing in the election for governor, he accepted the presidency of the college, in which he continued until his death.  There he taught economics, philosophy, and theology; he was popular with students and with lay audiences across the Midwest who attended his lectures promoting public schools. Mann also employed the first female faculty member to be paid on an equal basis with her male colleagues, [[Rebecca Pennell]], his niece.

In 1843, Mann traveled to Germany to investigate how the educational process worked.

It is not a law to be proved by exceptions, for it knows no exception.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Horace |last=Mann |title=A Few Thoughts for a Young Man: A Lecture, Delivered Before the Boston Mercantile Library Association, on Its 29th Anniversary |year=1853 |page=9}}</ref> He served in the Massachusetts State legislature  (1827\u20131837).

From September 1852 to his death, he served as President of [[Antioch College]].\n\nAbout Mann's intellectual progressivism, the historian [[Ellwood P.

On entering on his duties, he withdrew from all other professional or business engagements and from politics.\n\nHe held this position, and worked with a remarkable intensity, holding teachers' conventions, delivering numerous lectures and addresses, carrying on an extensive correspondence, and introducing numerous reforms. Mann persuaded his fellow modernizers, especially those in the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], to legislate tax-supported elementary public education in their states and to feminize the teaching force. Most northern states adopted one version or another of the system he established in Massachusetts, especially the program for \"[[normal schools]]\" to train professional teachers.<ref name=\"Mark Groen 1854, pp 251\u2013260\" />\n\nMann traveled to every school in the state so he could physically examine each school ground.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He planned and inaugurated the Massachusetts [[normal school]] system in [[Framingham State College|Lexington]] (which shortly thereafter moved to Framingham), [[Westfield State College|Barre]] (which shortly thereafter moved to Westfield) and [[Bridgewater State College|Bridgewater]], and began preparing a series of annual reports, which had a wide circulation and were considered as being \"among the best expositions, if, indeed, they are not the very best ones, of the practical benefits of a common school education both to the individual and to the state\".<ref name=\"hinsdale\">Hinsdale (1898).</ref> By his advocacy of the disuse of corporal punishment in school discipline, he was involved in a controversy with some of the Boston teachers that resulted in the adoption of his views.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtID=2&psid=3535 |title=The Struggle for Public Schools |work=Digital History |last1=Mintz |first1=S. |last2=McNeil |first2=S. |year=2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1838, he founded and edited ''The Common School Journal''. In this journal, Mann targeted the public school and its problems. His six main principles were:\n\n# the public should no longer remain ignorant; \n# that such education should be paid for, controlled, and sustained by an interested public; \n# that this education will be best provided in schools that embrace children from a variety of backgrounds; \n# that this education must be [[non-sectarian]]; \n# that this education must be taught using the tenets of a [[free society]]; and \n# that education should be provided by well-trained, professional teachers.\n\nUnder the auspices of the board, but at his own expense, he went to Europe in 1843 to visit schools, especially in [[Prussia]], and his seventh annual report, published after his return, embodied the results of his tour. Many editions of this report were printed, not only in Massachusetts but in other states, in some cases by private individuals and in others by legislatures; several editions were issued in England. Mann hoped that by bringing all children of all classes together, they could have a common learning experience. This would also give an opportunity to the less fortunate to advance in the social scale and education would \"equalize the conditions of men.\" Moreover, it was viewed also as a road to social advancement by the early labor movement and as a goal of having common schools. Mann also suggested that by having schools it would help those students who did not have appropriate discipline in the home. Building a person's character was just as important as reading, writing and arithmetic. Instilling values such as obedience to authority, promptness in attendance, and organizing the time according to bell ringing helped students prepare for future employment. Mann faced some resistance from parents who did not want to give up the moral education to teachers and bureaucrats. The normal schools trained mostly women, giving them new career opportunities as teachers.<ref>{{cite book |first=Linda |last=Eisenmann |title=Historical dictionary of women's education in the United States |year=1988 |page=259}}</ref> Mann believed that women were better suited for teaching, regardless of their status as a mother, and used his position to push for a [[Feminisation of the workplace|feminization]] of the profession.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motherteacher : the feminization of American education|last=S.|first=Sugg, Redding|date=1978|publisher=University Press of Virginia|isbn=0813907578|location=Charlottesville|oclc=3708082}}</ref>\n\nThe practical result of Mann's work was a revolution in the approach used in the common school system of Massachusetts, which in turn influenced the direction of other states. In carrying out his work, Mann met with bitter opposition by some Boston schoolmasters who strongly disapproved of his innovative pedagogical ideas,<ref>{{cite book |first= Myra |last= Glenn |title= Campaigns Against Corporal Punishment |year= 1984 |isbn= 0-87395-813-6 |pages= 104\u20136}}</ref> and by various religious sectarians, who contended against the exclusion of all sectarian instruction from the schools.\n\n===Secular nature===\nAs the ''Old Deluder Satan Act'' and other [[Massachusetts School Laws]] attest, early education in Massachusetts had a clear religious intent. However, by the time of Mann's leadership in education, various developments (including a vibrant populist Protestant faith and increased religious diversity) fostered a secular school system with a religiously passive stance.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Stephen V. |last1=Monsma |first2=J.

But here it stops, not because it claims to have compassed all truth; but because it disclaims to act as an umpire between hostile religious opinions.\"\n\nMann stated that this position resulted in a near-universal use of the Bible in the schools of Massachusetts and that this served as an argument against the assertion by some that Christianity was excluded from his schools, or that they were anti-Christian.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eURNAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA117&dq=inculcates+all+Christian+morals;+it+founds+its+morals+on+the+basis+of+religion |last=Mann |first=Horace |title=Twelfth Annual Report for 1848 of the Secretary of the Board of Education of Massachusetts |pages=116, 177, 121, 122|year=1849 }}</ref> A devotee of [[phrenology]], Mann believed education could eliminate or reduce human failings and compensate for any biological flaws.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The teacher wars : a history of America's most embattled profession|last=Dana.|first=Goldstein|isbn=9780345803627|edition= First Anchor books |location=New York|oclc=895117195|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\nMann also once stated that \"it may not be easy theoretically, to draw the line between those views of religious truth and of Christian faith which is common to all, and may, therefore, with propriety be inculcated in schools, and those which, being peculiar to individual sects, are therefore by law excluded; still it is believed that no practical difficulty occurs in the conduct of our schools in this regard.\"\n\nRather than sanctioning a particular church as was often the norm in many states, the Legislature proscribed books \"calculated to favor the tenets of any particular set of Christians.\"<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9S4XAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA14&dq=may+not+be+easy+theoretically,+to+draw+the+line+between+those+views+of+religious+truth+and+of+Christian+faith+which+is+common+to+all,+and+may,+therefore,+with+propriety+be+inculcated+in+schools,+and+those+which,+being+peculiar+to+individual+sects,+are+therefore+by+law+excluded;+still+it+is+believed+that+no+practical+difficulty+occurs+in+the+conduct+of+our+schools+in+this+regard |author=Massachusetts Board of Education |title=Annual Report of the Board of Education |origyear=Covering the year 1837 |pages=14, 15|year=1838 }}</ref>\n\n==U.S. Congress==\nIn the spring of 1848 he was elected to the [[United States Congress]] as a [[Whig party (United States)|Whig]] to fill the vacancy caused by the death of [[John Quincy Adams]]. His first speech in that role was in advocacy of its right and duty to exclude [[slavery]] from the territories, and in a letter in December of that year he said: \"I think the country is to experience serious times. Interference with slavery will excite civil commotion in the South. But it is best to interfere. Now is the time to see whether the Union is a rope of sand or a band of steel.\" Again he said: \"I consider no evil as great as slavery, and I would pass the [[Wilmot Proviso]] whether the South rebel or not.\"{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} During the first session, he volunteered as counsel for [[Pearl incident|Drayton and Sayres]], who were indicted for stealing 76 slaves in the [[District of Columbia]], and at the trial was engaged for 21 successive days in their defense. In 1850, he was engaged in a controversy with [[Daniel Webster]] in regard to the extension of slavery and the [[Fugitive Slave Law]], calling Webster's support for the [[Compromise of 1850]] a \"vile catastrophe\", and comparing him to \"Lucifer descending from Heaven\".<ref>https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Speech_Costs_Senator_His_Seat.htm</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Kennedy|title=Profiles in Courage| year=2004| pages=69\u201370}}</ref>  Mann was defeated by a single vote at the ensuing nominating convention by Webster's supporters; but, on appealing to the people as an independent anti-slavery candidate, he was re-elected, serving from April 1848 until March 1853.\n\n==Leadership of Antioch College and last years==\n[[File:HMann.jpg|left|thumb|Original daguerreotype of Rep.

Failing in the election for governor, he accepted the presidency of the college, in which he continued until his death.  There he taught economics, philosophy, and theology; he was popular with students and with lay audiences across the Midwest who attended his lectures promoting public schools. Mann also employed the first female faculty member to be paid on an equal basis with her male colleagues, [[Rebecca Pennell]], his niece. His commencement message to the class of 1859 was to \"be ashamed to die until you have won some victory for humanity\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.antiochcollege.edu/news/archive/antioch-college-announced-horace-mann-fellowship-first-class |title=Antioch College Announced the Horace Mann Fellowship for First Class |publisher=Antioch College |date=February 3, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAntioch College was founded by the [[Christian Connexion]] which later withdrew its financial support causing the college to struggle for many years with meager financial resources due to sectarian infighting.

In 1843, Mann traveled to Germany to investigate how the educational process worked.

The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Despite being impacted by earthquakes in both 1906 and 1989, the campus was rebuilt each time. In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by [[Herbert Hoover]] to preserve artifacts related to [[World War I]]. The Stanford Medical Center, completed in 1959, is a teaching hospital with over 800 beds. The [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] (originally named the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stanford-University|title=Stanford University \u2013 Location, Enrollment, & Notable Alumni|publisher=britannica.com|date=December 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great eastern universities, most specifically [[Cornell University]]. Stanford opened being called the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to faculty being former Cornell affiliates (either professors, alumni, or both) including its first president, [[David Starr Jordan]].

On June 1, 1903, she resigned her powers as founder and the board took on its full powers. In the 1950s the board decided that 15 members was not sufficient to do all the work needed and in March 1954 petitioned the courts to raise the maximum number to 23, of whom 20 would be regular trustees serving 10-year terms and 3 would be alumni trustees serving 5-year terms.

The institution opened in 1891 on Stanford's previous Palo Alto farm. Despite being impacted by earthquakes in both 1906 and 1989, the campus was rebuilt each time. In 1919, The Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace was started by [[Herbert Hoover]] to preserve artifacts related to [[World War I]]. The Stanford Medical Center, completed in 1959, is a teaching hospital with over 800 beds. The [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]] (originally named the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center), established in 1962, performs research in particle physics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Stanford-University|title=Stanford University \u2013 Location, Enrollment, & Notable Alumni|publisher=britannica.com|date=December 12, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJane and Leland Stanford modeled their university after the great eastern universities, most specifically [[Cornell University]]. Stanford opened being called the \"Cornell of the West\" in 1891 due to faculty being former Cornell affiliates (either professors, alumni, or both) including its first president, [[David Starr Jordan]]. Both Cornell and Stanford were among the first to have higher education be accessible, nonsectarian, and open to women as well as to men. Cornell is credited as one of the first American universities to adopt this radical departure from traditional education, and Stanford became an early adopter as well.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Davis |first1=Margo Baumgartner |last2=Nilan |first2=Roxanne |title=The Stanford Album: A Photographic History, 1885\u20131945 |date=1989 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-1639-0 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oe0qpzomMwkC&pg=PA14 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Land ==\n[[File:View Stanford.jpg|thumb|An [[aerial photography|aerial photograph]] of the center of the Stanford University campus in 2008.]]\n\nMost of Stanford University is on an {{convert|8180|acre|sqmi km2|1|adj=on}}<ref name=\"stanford_facts_glance\" /> campus, one of the largest in the [[United States]].{{#tag:ref|It is often stated that Stanford has the largest contiguous campus in the world (or the United States)<ref name=\"virtualtour\">{{cite web\n|url=http://web.stanford.edu/dept/visitorinfo/tours/virtual/index.html | title=Virtual Tours | publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=April 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Keck|first=Gayle |title=Stanford: A Haven in Silicon Valley|url=http://www.gaylekeck.com/wp-content/uploads/Silicon-Valley-Story.pdf|publisher=Executive Travel Magazine}}</ref> but that depends on definitions.
