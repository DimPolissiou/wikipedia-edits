The first school in H\u00f3lar was founded in 1106. It was renamed '''H\u00f3lar Agricultural College''' in 1882 and became H\u00f3lar University College in 2007. This long history of education at H\u00f3lar makes it one of the oldest schools in Europe.\n\n==History==\nH\u00f3lar in Hjaltadalur has a long history of schools and education. Bishop J\u00f3n \u00d6gmundsson\u2019s cathedral school was founded in 1106, and after the Reformation in 1550 the school was converted to a Latin school that remained in operation until 1801. In 1882, an agricultural school was established at H\u00f3lar, and H\u00f3lar University College traces its roots to that institution. During the past 15 years, the school at H\u00f3lar has developed from a conventional agricultural school to a modern university-level institution.\n\n===Architecture===\n\nOn campus the architectural history of Iceland can be traced from traditional turf houses to the present day and the school has a policy of safeguarding this heritage through sustainable use. The main building, which houses the department of tourism, is the work of two of the first architects in Iceland and dates from 1910 and 1927 respectively. Among the most important architectural landmarks in Iceland is the cathedral consecrated in 1763.\n\n===Early Settlement===\n\nAlthough H\u00f3lar is not mentioned in the Icelandic sagas, it is thought that it was settled by people from the early settlement of Hof, which is about 2,5&nbsp;km south of H\u00f3lar. Hof, which is mentioned in the sagas, was settled by Hjalti \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson whose sons became famous for their generosity and gallantry. The story tells that when they buried their father they gave the largest known burial feast in heathen times. Twelve hundred guests were invited and after the feast all men of distinction were sent on their way with valuable gifts. There is no doubt that their nobility and that of their descendants helped establish the fame and prosperity of H\u00f3lar.\nIn the middle of the eleventh century a kinsman of the Hof family named Oxi Hjaltason, who lived in H\u00f3lar, built a great church there. Around the year 1100, H\u00f3lar was owned by Illugi Bjarnason who, when a bishop's seat was established in northern Iceland, gave H\u00f3lar to the Church for that purpose.\n\n===Bishop's seat and the bishops===\nDuring Catholic times, H\u00f3lar accumulated great wealth and was densely populated. During the peak of the bishop's seat era, H\u00f3lar owned 352 estates that accounted for about a quarter of all the estates in the north of the country. Apart from that it enjoyed the privilege of driftwood (a valuable resource) along with rights to other advantages in several surrounding areas. The first printing press in Iceland was installed here around 1530 and H\u00f3lar was the last stronghold of the Catholic Church during the Reformation. The present cathedral, consecrated in 1763, is the oldest stone church in Iceland.\nH\u00f3lar remained a bishop's seat for almost seven centuries from 1106 until 1802 when H\u00f3lar was sold. During that era H\u00f3lar was the true centre of northern Iceland and one of the major cultural centres of the area. This status was partly due to the school that was around there for most of this time.\nOf the thirty six bishops who resided at H\u00f3lar, twenty three were Catholic and thirteen Lutheran. Many of these have left their mark in Icelandic history. Among the most well known are J\u00f3n \u00d6gmundsson, the Sacred (1106-1121), Gu\u00f0mundur Arason the Good (1203-1237), J\u00f3n Arason (1524-1550) and Gu\u00f0brandur \u00deorl\u00e1ksson (1571-1627).\nThe first bishop in H\u00f3lar was J\u00f3n \u00d6gmundsson the Sacred, who was ordained in 1106. He established and ran a seminary at H\u00f3lar and became very well known for this as well as his management of the church. The commonly used phrase \"heim a\u00f0 H\u00f3lum\" or \"back home to H\u00f3lar\" dates back to him.\nGu\u00f0mundur Arason the Good was famous for his rivalry with some of the most respected chieftains in northern Iceland. Gu\u00f0mundur went on to lead a band of followers in what became a semi vagrant life.\nJ\u00f3n Arason was the last Catholic bishop, he fought strongly against the Reformation and was finally beheaded along with his two sons in Sk\u00e1lholt in November 1550, and the resistance against the Reformation came to an end. J\u00f3n was a well known poet and it was he who brought the first printing press to Iceland in around 1530.\nGu\u00f0brandur \u00deorl\u00e1ksson was famous for his active book publishing, among of them was the first translation of the Bible into Icelandic, which was printed in 1584. The printing of this Bible is thought to have played a crucial role in the preservation of the Icelandic language.\n\nH\u00f3lar became a vicarage after the bishop's seat was abolished until 1861 when the vicarage was moved to Vi\u00f0v\u00edk. In 1952 H\u00f3lar was re- established as a vicarage and in 1986 it became the residence of the ordained bishop of the H\u00f3lar benefice.\nThe present bishop at H\u00f3lar is Solveig L\u00e1ra Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir.\n\n===Cathedral school - Latin school - Agricultural school - University===\nH\u00f3lar in Hjaltadalur has a long history of schools and education. Bishop J\u00f3n \u00d6gmundsson\u2019s cathedral school was founded in 1106, and after the Reformation in 1550 the school was converted to a Latin school that remained in operation until 1801. In 1882 an agricultural school was established at H\u00f3lar, and H\u00f3lar University College traces its roots to that institution. During the past 15 years, the school at H\u00f3lar has developed from a conventional agricultural school to a modern university-level institution. In 2003, the College was granted permission to graduate students with an undergraduate degree, and on 1 July 2007 H\u00f3lar University College formally commenced operations.\n\n==Departments==\nThere are three departments in the University.\n\n===Department of Aquaculture and Fish Biology===\n[[File:Veri\u00f0.jpg|thumb|Veri\u00f0 - The main building for the Department of Aquaculture and Fish Biology. Located in Sau\u00f0\u00e1rkr\u00f3kur.]]\nThe objective of the Department of Aquaculture and Fish Biology is to gather and disseminate knowledge in the fields of aquatic biology, aquaculture, and fish biology. The department is an international centre for research, instruction, and continuing  education in aquatic biology, aquaculture, and fish biology. The department promotes the professional development of aquaculture in the spirit of sustainable development.\n\nThe department has approached its objective through a good relationship between research and teaching, a strong collaboration with other higher education institution, strong rooting in the industry and through flexibility for students in controlling their own studies.\n\n===Department of Equine Studies===\nThe objective of the Equine Science Department is to provide professional education in the fields of horse breeding, horse training, horsemanship, as well as in teaching and coaching riding. Furthermore, the department works towards development and innovation within the field of equine science, through research activities. It also promotes increased profitability in the sector, the spread of equestrian activities, and the welfare of horses. The department is an international centre for education and research in the fields of horse breeding, horse training, horsemanship, and riding instructions.\n\nH\u00f3lar College has a formal collaboration agreement with [[The Icelandic Horse Trainers Association]] regarding further development of the programs and quality control of the education provided by the college\n\n===Department of Tourism Studies===\nIt is the department\u2018s mission to train students to be professionals and prepare them for active participation in policy making and development of the tourism sector and for research based graduate programs. The department provides the industry with well educated people who will improve the professionalism and quality of Icelandic tourist services.\n\nThis is achieved by two main emphases: An emphasis on teaching methods based on student involvement and training communication skills, analytical thinking and critical evaluation. Students are expected to participate in the on-line educational community in a professional manner, and they are expected to participate actively in the quality measures and course development. An emphasis is placed on providing practical education that leads to employment opportunities.  Many of the courses have practical components. The diploma programs both have an extended practicum (15 and 30 ECTS respectively) where students are expected to be reflective practitioners in the field under supervision of faculty as well as a workplace mentor.\n\nIn the program offerings these aims are addressed by course offerings on four foundations of tourism: Infrastructure and development; Management, marketing and business skills; tourist experience \u2013 demand, expectations and experiences; Supply of services, events and products. Quality, sustainability and professionalism are the underlying principles of the programs.\nEach of those four streams offers both general courses as well as courses focused on more specific matters. Tourism is a very diverse sector and offers range of opportunities to engage in specialized fields. The aim of the diploma programs is to give the students a broad overview of the sector and insight in topics of relevance. Specific subjects are more common during the second half of the BA program, in particular with a focus on various types of niche tourism.\n\nThe programs progress from the general to the specific. The diploma programs open with an overview course; Tourism and Festivals and events, respectively. There the practicum and for the Event management, the final project are the in-depth, individual study components. The first year offers the overview and in years 2 and 3 more specific issues are raised and the demand for personal input and individual research increases.\n\n==Living at H\u00f3lar==\nThe community at H\u00f3lar has grown in tandem with the growth of  H\u00f3lar University College. The ecclesiastical site, community and  farm-land at H\u00f3lar is operated by H\u00f3lar University College, whose objective is to maintain the dignity and sanctity of the site. To that end, an ambitious environmental policy has been set.\n\nThe community at H\u00f3lar is small and close knit. The campus at H\u00f3lar in Hjaltadalur has excellent residential housing, both for individuals and for families. There is a primary school and a pre-school on campus, serving H\u00f3lar and the neighbouring rural area.\n\nThere are diverse opportunities for outdoor activities in the area. H\u00f3lar forest borders the campus so it is easy to walk, jog, or go cross-country skiing and there are various longer hiking trails in the immediate area. There is also a sports hall and swimming pool. Facilities for horse riding are excellent.\n\nMost of the students and employees of H\u00f3lar University College and other institutions located at H\u00f3lar live in the area. H\u00f3lar is a popular destination and tourist services are operated there in the summer months. At H\u00f3lar the cafeteria where students and employees can purchase lunch is operated year-round.\n\nThe nearest town and service centre is [[Sau\u00f0\u00e1rkr\u00f3kur]], 30&nbsp;km from H\u00f3lar. In the Sau\u00f0\u00e1rkr\u00f3kur campus there is a large dining room with a kitchen for students and employees, as well as easy access to the town shops and restaurants.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Skemman.is]] (digital library)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.holar.is/en/english H\u00f3lar University College]\n\n{{Coord|65.7336|-19.1135|type:edu_region:IS|display=title}}\n\n{{Icelandic universities}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Holar University College}}\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1882]]\n[[Category:Universities in Iceland]]\n[[Category:1882 establishments in Iceland]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|section=|\n{{More citations needed|date=November 2015}}\n{{Advert|date=November 2015}}\n}}\n{{Infobox University\n|name            =H\u00f3lar University College\n|native_name     =H\u00f3lask\u00f3li - H\u00e1sk\u00f3linn \u00e1 H\u00f3lum\n|image           =Holask\u00f3li_Seal.png\n|image_size      =200px\n|motto           =\n|established     =1106 / 1882 / 2007\n|type            =[[Public university|Public]]\n|endowment       =\n|staff           =\n|faculty         =\n|rector          =[[Erla Bj\u00f6rk \u00d6rn\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir]]\n|students        =\n|undergrad       =\n|postgrad        =\n|doctoral        =\n|profess         =\n|city            =[[H\u00f3lar]]\n|country         =[[Iceland]]\n|campus          =[[Rural]]\n|free_label      =\n|free            =\n|colors          = [[Maroon (color)|Maroon]] and [[Gold (color)|Gold]]<br />{{Color box|#800000}} {{Color box|#FFD700}}\n|mascot          =\n|nickname        = H\u00f3lask\u00f3li\n|affiliations    =\n|footnotes       =\n|website         =[http://www.holar.is www.holar.is]\n|coor            =\n|logo            =[[Image:Haskolinn a holum logo.png]]\n}}\n[[Image:H\u00f3lar2.jpg|thumb|right|300px|H\u00f3lar University College]]\n'''H\u00f3lar University College''' is located in [[H\u00f3lar]], Iceland, an important historical centre of education.

However, there are many terms in Islam to refer to religiously sanctioned positions of Islam. In the broadest sense, the term ''ulema'' ({{lang-ar| \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621}}) is used to describe the body of Muslim scholars who have completed several years of training and study of [[Islamic studies|Islamic sciences]]. A jurist who interprets Islamic law is called a [[mufti]] ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0641\u062a\u064a}}) and often issues legal opinions, called [[fatwa]]s. A scholar of jurisprudence is called a [[faqih]] ({{lang-ar|\u0641\u0642\u064a\u0647}}). Someone who studies the science of hadith is called a [[muhaddith]]. A [[qadi]] is a judge in an Islamic court. [[Honorific]] titles given to scholars include [[sheikh]], [[mullah]] and [[Mawlawi (Islamic title)|mawlawi]]. [[Imam]] ({{lang-ar|\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645}}) is a leadership position, often used in the context of conducting Islamic worship services.\n\n===Schools of jurisprudence===\n[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|right|257px|Islamic [[madh'hab|schools of law]] in the [[Muslim world]]]]\n{{Main|Madhhab}}\nA school of jurisprudence is referred to as a ''madhab'' ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628}}). The four major Sunni schools are the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and sometimes [[\u1e92\u0101hir\u012b]] while the three major Shia schools are [[Ja'fari]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] and [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]]. Each differ in their methodology, called ''[[Usul al-fiqh]]'' (\"principles of jurisprudence\"). The following of decisions by a religious expert without necessarily examining the decision's reasoning is called [[taqlid]].

The prohibition of [[usury]] has resulted in the development of [[Islamic banking]]. During the time of Muhammad, any money that went to the state, was immediately used to help the poor. Then in 634, [[Umar]] formally established the welfare state [[Bayt al-mal]].

However, there are many terms in Islam to refer to religiously sanctioned positions of Islam. In the broadest sense, the term ''ulema'' ({{lang-ar| \u0639\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0621}}) is used to describe the body of Muslim scholars who have completed several years of training and study of [[Islamic studies|Islamic sciences]]. A jurist who interprets Islamic law is called a [[mufti]] ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0641\u062a\u064a}}) and often issues legal opinions, called [[fatwa]]s. A scholar of jurisprudence is called a [[faqih]] ({{lang-ar|\u0641\u0642\u064a\u0647}}). Someone who studies the science of hadith is called a [[muhaddith]]. A [[qadi]] is a judge in an Islamic court. [[Honorific]] titles given to scholars include [[sheikh]], [[mullah]] and [[Mawlawi (Islamic title)|mawlawi]]. [[Imam]] ({{lang-ar|\u0625\u0645\u0627\u0645}}) is a leadership position, often used in the context of conducting Islamic worship services.\n\n===Schools of jurisprudence===\n[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|right|257px|Islamic [[madh'hab|schools of law]] in the [[Muslim world]]]]\n{{Main|Madhhab}}\nA school of jurisprudence is referred to as a ''madhab'' ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0630\u0647\u0628}}). The four major Sunni schools are the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and sometimes [[\u1e92\u0101hir\u012b]] while the three major Shia schools are [[Ja'fari]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] and [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]]. Each differ in their methodology, called ''[[Usul al-fiqh]]'' (\"principles of jurisprudence\"). The following of decisions by a religious expert without necessarily examining the decision's reasoning is called [[taqlid]]. The term ''ghair muqallid'' literally refers to those who do not use taqlid and by extension do not have a [[madhab]].<ref>''Encyclopedeia of Eminent Thinkers''. p. 38, K.S.

The [[Bayt al-mal]] or the welfare state was for the Muslim and Non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. The [[Bayt al-mal]] ran for hundreds of years under the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] in the 7th century and continued through the [[Umayyad]] period and well into the [[Abbasid]] era.

Archaeological evidence suggests glass-making dates back to at least 3,600 BCE in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], or [[Syria]]. The earliest known glass objects were [[beads]], perhaps created accidentally during metal-working or the production of [[faience]]. Due to its ease of [[formability]] into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels: [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]], [[vase]]s, [[bottle]]s, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms, it has also been used for [[paperweight collecting|paperweights]] and [[Marble (toy)|marbles]]. Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed with [[vitreous enamel]]s, leading to its use in [[stained glass]] windows and other [[glass art]] objects.\n\nThe [[refraction|refractive]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflective]] and [[Transmission coefficient#Optics|transmission]] properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing [[Lens (optics)|optical lenses]], [[prism]]s, and [[optoelectronics]] materials. Extruded [[glass fiber|glass fibres]] have application as [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as [[glass wool]] so as to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic ([[fiberglass|fibreglass]]).\n\n== Glass structure (microscopic) ==\n[[File:Silica.svg|thumb|left|The amorphous structure of glassy silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in two dimensions.

Glass is most often formed by rapid cooling ([[quenching]]) of the molten form; some glasses such as [[volcanic glass]] are naturally occurring. The most familiar, and historically the oldest, types of manufactured glass are \"silicate glasses\" based on the chemical compound [[silicon dioxide|silica]] (silicon dioxide, or [[quartz]]), the primary constituent of [[sand]]. Soda-lime glass, containing around 70% silica, account for around 90% of manufactured glass. The term ''glass'', in popular usage, is often used to refer only to this type of material, although silica-free glasses often have desirable properties for applications in modern communications technology. Some objects, such as drinking glasses and eyeglasses, are so commonly made of silicate-based glass that they are simply called by the name of the material.\n\nAlthough brittle, silicate glass is extremely durable, and many examples of glass fragments exist from early glass-making cultures. Archaeological evidence suggests glass-making dates back to at least 3,600 BCE in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Egypt]], or [[Syria]]. The earliest known glass objects were [[beads]], perhaps created accidentally during metal-working or the production of [[faience]]. Due to its ease of [[formability]] into any shape, glass has been traditionally used for vessels: [[bowl (vessel)|bowls]], [[vase]]s, [[bottle]]s, jars and drinking glasses. In its most solid forms, it has also been used for [[paperweight collecting|paperweights]] and [[Marble (toy)|marbles]]. Glass can be coloured by adding metal salts or painted and printed with [[vitreous enamel]]s, leading to its use in [[stained glass]] windows and other [[glass art]] objects.\n\nThe [[refraction|refractive]], [[Reflection (physics)|reflective]] and [[Transmission coefficient#Optics|transmission]] properties of glass make glass suitable for manufacturing [[Lens (optics)|optical lenses]], [[prism]]s, and [[optoelectronics]] materials. Extruded [[glass fiber|glass fibres]] have application as [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] in communications networks, thermal insulating material when matted as [[glass wool]] so as to trap air, or in glass-fibre reinforced plastic ([[fiberglass|fibreglass]]).\n\n== Glass structure (microscopic) ==\n[[File:Silica.svg|thumb|left|The amorphous structure of glassy silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) in two dimensions.

North of [[Devore, California|Devore]], the highway follows the approximate alignment of historic [[U.S. Highway 66]] along with [[U.S. Highway 91]] and [[U.S. Highway 395]]. U.S. 395 breaks away at Hesperia and the route continues on a direct path to [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] {{convert|35|mi|km|0}} to the north. Meanwhile, the old alignments of U.S. 91 and U.S. 66 follow the [[Mojave River]] from [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] to Barstow along the [[National Old Trails Road|National Trails Highway]]. At that point, I-15 follows the old route of U.S. 91 exclusively as U.S. 66 turned east toward [[Needles, California|Needles]]. For many parts of the highway, high-voltage [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, such as [[Path 46]] and [[Path 27]], almost all originating from the [[Hoover Dam]], follow the freeway. Many of these link distant power stations to the [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan area.\n\nThe southern starting point of Interstate 15 was in 1957 planned to be in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], at the interchange with the San Bernardino Freeway (then US 70/99, now [[Interstate 10|I-10]]). This was logical as I-15 was following the old alignment of the historic Route 66 which passed through San Bernardino. The segment was completed accordingly.\n\nIn 1964, legislation was later passed to extend the interstate to [[San Diego]]. Instead of extending the existing freeway from the I-10 interchange south, however, the [[California Department of Transportation]] drew a new segment in Devore that \"branched\" off of the original alignment and bypassed San Bernardino altogether. This segment's alignment is generally northeast to southwest for about {{convert|13|mi|km|0}}. Then, in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Rancho Cucamonga]], its directional alignment shifts to north\u2013south where it eventually meets with Interstate 10 (about {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of the original interchange in San Bernardino). The segment that had been built from Devore to San Bernardino was retained as an interstate, but was re-numbered as [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]. Note that during the construction of I-15's present alignment, and for some time afterwards, I-215 was numbered as I-15E, and its actual mileage would begin at Interstate 10.

It is the main north\u2013south connection for the state. The highway approximately follows the old alignment of [[U.S. Highway 91]] from [[St. George, Utah|St. George]] to [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]]. The highway passes through the fast-growing [[Utah's Dixie]] region in the southwestern part of the state, which includes [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], and eventually most of the major cities and suburbs along the [[Wasatch Front]], including [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Orem, Utah|Orem]], [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[Layton, Utah|Layton]], and [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]].

The interstate [[Concurrency (road)|merges]] with [[Interstate 80|I-80]] for about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} from [[South Salt Lake, Utah|South Salt Lake]] to just west of [[Downtown Salt Lake City]] and also merges with [[Interstate 84 in Utah|Interstate 84]] from [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] to [[Tremonton, Utah|Tremonton]]. Along nearly its entire length through the state, I-15 winds its way along the western edge of a nearly continuous range of mountains (the [[Wasatch Range]] in the northern half of the state). The only exceptions are north of [[Cove Fort, Utah|Cove Fort]] and when it passes between [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]] and St. George, known as the Black Ridge, a transition zone of drastic change in elevation and climate, an area where the eastern [[Great Basin]], [[Colorado Plateau]] and [[Mojave Desert]] converge.\n\n===Idaho===\n{{main|Interstate 15 in Idaho}}\n[[File:I 15 US 20 Junction Sign.jpg|left|thumb|I-15/US-20 Jct. in [[Idaho Falls|Idaho Falls, ID]]]]\nI-15 passes through [[Idaho]] for {{convert|196|mi|km|0}}.

Once Interstate 15 was relatively intact, U.S. 91 was decommissioned, except for one part in Northern Utah/Southern Idaho where Interstate 15 instead followed the route of former [[U.S. Route 191]].\n\nInterstate 15 originally had two suffixed routes. In California, Interstate 15 had an eastern branch bypassing [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], which was designated Interstate 15E. I-15E was renumbered and is now [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]. Present day routing of Interstate 15 in California was originally given \"I-15W\" as its title while it was under construction (the original asphalt portions from Temescal Canyon to Ontario Avenue were dubbed I-15W on maps until 1974), but was never officially signed as such.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-215_ca.html |title = entry for Interstate 215 California |publisher = Interstate-guide.com |date = |accessdate = November 27, 2011 }}</ref> In Idaho, I-15 had a western branch near [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] that connected I-15 and I-84 (then I-80N).

In Utah, I-15 has been near-constantly upgraded in the [[Wasatch Front]], and future plans released by the [[UDOT|Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT)]] indicate that this will continue in the north ''and'' the far south of the state as well, due to the extremely rapid growth of [[Washington County, Utah|Washington County]] and surrounding areas.

North of [[Devore, California|Devore]], the highway follows the approximate alignment of historic [[U.S. Highway 66]] along with [[U.S. Highway 91]] and [[U.S. Highway 395]]. U.S. 395 breaks away at Hesperia and the route continues on a direct path to [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] {{convert|35|mi|km|0}} to the north. Meanwhile, the old alignments of U.S. 91 and U.S. 66 follow the [[Mojave River]] from [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] to Barstow along the [[National Old Trails Road|National Trails Highway]]. At that point, I-15 follows the old route of U.S. 91 exclusively as U.S. 66 turned east toward [[Needles, California|Needles]]. For many parts of the highway, high-voltage [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, such as [[Path 46]] and [[Path 27]], almost all originating from the [[Hoover Dam]], follow the freeway. Many of these link distant power stations to the [[Los Angeles]] metropolitan area.\n\nThe southern starting point of Interstate 15 was in 1957 planned to be in [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], at the interchange with the San Bernardino Freeway (then US 70/99, now [[Interstate 10|I-10]]). This was logical as I-15 was following the old alignment of the historic Route 66 which passed through San Bernardino. The segment was completed accordingly.\n\nIn 1964, legislation was later passed to extend the interstate to [[San Diego]]. Instead of extending the existing freeway from the I-10 interchange south, however, the [[California Department of Transportation]] drew a new segment in Devore that \"branched\" off of the original alignment and bypassed San Bernardino altogether. This segment's alignment is generally northeast to southwest for about {{convert|13|mi|km|0}}. Then, in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Rancho Cucamonga]], its directional alignment shifts to north\u2013south where it eventually meets with Interstate 10 (about {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of the original interchange in San Bernardino). The segment that had been built from Devore to San Bernardino was retained as an interstate, but was re-numbered as [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]. Note that during the construction of I-15's present alignment, and for some time afterwards, I-215 was numbered as I-15E, and its actual mileage would begin at Interstate 10. I-15 runs for a total of {{convert|287|mi|km|0}} in California.\n\n===Nevada===\n[[File:Interstate_15,_Las_Vegas,_South_of_Flight_Path_on_Departure_(14203692275).jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of I-15 looking south from Sunset Road in the [[Las Vegas Valley]] ]]\n{{main|Interstate 15 in Nevada}}\nInterstate 15 begins in [[Primm, Nevada|Primm]] and continues through [[Las Vegas]] along the [[Las Vegas Strip]] corridor. Then the interstate crosses the border with [[Arizona]] in [[Mesquite, Nevada|Mesquite]]. The interstate in [[Nevada]] runs entirely in [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]], for a distance of {{convert|123.8|mi|km|0}}.\n\n===Arizona===\n[[File:Red rock cliff walls in Virgin River Gorge.jpg|thumb|left|I-15 passes through the [[Virgin River]] Gorge, Arizona revealing scenic reddish brown cliffs.]] [[File:Interstate 15 Arizona.jpg|thumb|right|I-15 in Arizona]]\n{{main|Interstate 15 in Arizona}}\nI-15 passes through the [[Arizona Strip|northwestern corner]] of [[Arizona]] with a total length of {{convert|29.4|mi|km|0}}.<ref>Arizona Department of Transportation Project 015 MO 000 H577901C, sheet 73 of 103 - revised May 2005</ref> The stretch is separated from the rest of the state and has one major exit, at [[Beaver Dam, Arizona|Beaver Dam]]/[[Littlefield, Arizona]]. It includes a spectacular section where the road twists between the narrow walls of the [[Virgin River Gorge]].\n\n===Utah===\n[[File:I-15indowntown.jpg|right|thumb|I-15 in [[Salt Lake City]]]]\n{{main|Interstate 15 in Utah}}\nI-15 continues through [[Utah]] for {{convert|401|mi|km|0}}. It is the main north\u2013south connection for the state. The highway approximately follows the old alignment of [[U.S. Highway 91]] from [[St. George, Utah|St. George]] to [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]]. The highway passes through the fast-growing [[Utah's Dixie]] region in the southwestern part of the state, which includes [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]], and eventually most of the major cities and suburbs along the [[Wasatch Front]], including [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Orem, Utah|Orem]], [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]], [[Salt Lake City]], [[Layton, Utah|Layton]], and [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]]. Near [[Cove Fort, Utah|Cove Fort]], [[Interstate 70]] begins its journey eastward across the country. The interstate [[Concurrency (road)|merges]] with [[Interstate 80|I-80]] for about {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} from [[South Salt Lake, Utah|South Salt Lake]] to just west of [[Downtown Salt Lake City]] and also merges with [[Interstate 84 in Utah|Interstate 84]] from [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] to [[Tremonton, Utah|Tremonton]]. Along nearly its entire length through the state, I-15 winds its way along the western edge of a nearly continuous range of mountains (the [[Wasatch Range]] in the northern half of the state). The only exceptions are north of [[Cove Fort, Utah|Cove Fort]] and when it passes between [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]] and St. George, known as the Black Ridge, a transition zone of drastic change in elevation and climate, an area where the eastern [[Great Basin]], [[Colorado Plateau]] and [[Mojave Desert]] converge.\n\n===Idaho===\n{{main|Interstate 15 in Idaho}}\n[[File:I 15 US 20 Junction Sign.jpg|left|thumb|I-15/US-20 Jct. in [[Idaho Falls|Idaho Falls, ID]]]]\nI-15 passes through [[Idaho]] for {{convert|196|mi|km|0}}. Interstate 15 crosses the [[Utah]] state line in [[Oneida County, Idaho|Oneida County]]. The highway runs through [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]], [[Blackfoot, Idaho|Blackfoot]], and [[Idaho Falls, Idaho|Idaho Falls]], intersecting with [[Interstate 86 (west)|Interstate 86]]. The last county in Idaho that Interstate 15 passes through is [[Clark County, Idaho|Clark County]]. Finally, the interstate reaches the [[Montana]] state line at [[Monida Pass]].\n\n===Montana===\n\n[[File:greatfallscitylights.jpg|thumb|right|I-15 (foreground left to right) goes through the city of Great Falls, MT]] [[File:Interstate15ruralMT.jpg|thumb|right|Interstate 15, 20 miles south of [[Dillon, Montana]]]]\n{{Main|Interstate 15 in Montana}}\nInterstate 15 continues onward through {{convert|396|mi|km|0}} of [[Montana]] through the cities of [[Butte, Montana|Butte]], [[Helena, Montana|Helena]] and [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]], intersecting with [[Interstate 90]], [[Interstate 115]] and [[Interstate 315]]. At [[Sweet Grass, Montana|Sweet Grass]], I-15 terminates upon [[Sweetgrass\u2013Coutts Border Crossing|crossing the Canadian border]] into the province of [[Alberta]]; however, I-15 signage is present on [[Alberta Highway 4]] southbound from [[Lethbridge]] to the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canadian border]].\n\n==History==\nInterstate 15 was constructed along the route of [[U.S. Route 91]]. Once Interstate 15 was relatively intact, U.S. 91 was decommissioned, except for one part in Northern Utah/Southern Idaho where Interstate 15 instead followed the route of former [[U.S. Route 191]].\n\nInterstate 15 originally had two suffixed routes. In California, Interstate 15 had an eastern branch bypassing [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], which was designated Interstate 15E. I-15E was renumbered and is now [[Interstate 215 (California)|Interstate 215]]. Present day routing of Interstate 15 in California was originally given \"I-15W\" as its title while it was under construction (the original asphalt portions from Temescal Canyon to Ontario Avenue were dubbed I-15W on maps until 1974), but was never officially signed as such.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-215_ca.html |title = entry for Interstate 215 California |publisher = Interstate-guide.com |date = |accessdate = November 27, 2011 }}</ref> In Idaho, I-15 had a western branch near [[Pocatello, Idaho|Pocatello]] that connected I-15 and I-84 (then I-80N). This highway was designated Interstate 15W. It is now the [[Interstate 86 (west)|western I-86]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-086_west.html |title = entry for I-86 Western |publisher = Interstate-guide.com |date =  |accessdate = November 27, 2011 |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6DzWDecj8?url=http://www.interstate-guide.com/i-086_west.html |archive-date = January 27, 2013 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Growth along I-15===\nSince the construction of Interstate 15, California, Nevada, and Utah have consistently ranked in the fastest-growing areas of the United States. As a result, the route of I-15 has substantially increased in population and commuter traffic has increased the traffic burden on the freeway. Current population estimates are that more than 75 percent of the population of Utah,<ref name=UTI>{{cite web |url = http://www.utah.com/visitor/state_facts/population.htm |title = Population-Visitor Center- Utah.com |accessdate = January 2, 2008 |publisher = Utah Travel Industry |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080117034523/http://www.utah.com/visitor/state_facts/population.htm |archivedate = January 17, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> 19 percent of the population of California, and more than 70 percent of the population of Nevada live in counties where Interstate 15 is the primary [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]].\n\nSimilarly, in California, Interstate 15 is seeing more commuter traffic due to the growth of the [[Mojave Desert]] communities of [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia]], [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] and [[Barstow, California|Barstow]]. In Utah, I-15 has been near-constantly upgraded in the [[Wasatch Front]], and future plans released by the [[UDOT|Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT)]] indicate that this will continue in the north ''and'' the far south of the state as well, due to the extremely rapid growth of [[Washington County, Utah|Washington County]] and surrounding areas. In like manner, [[Las Vegas]] in Nevada has seen growth along I-15, and in all of the states that it currently serves, it has recently been or is currently in the process of being upgraded to increase capacity and efficiency.<ref name=udot>{{cite web |url = http://www.udot.utah.gov/main/f?p=100:pg:0:::1:T,V:69, |title = Utah Department of Transportation, Projects Under Construction |accessdate = January 2, 2008 |publisher = Utah Department of Transportation }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nevadadot.com/Projects_and_Programs/Road_Projects/District_1_Construction_Report.aspx |title = District 1 Construction Report |accessdate = January 2, 2008 |publisher = Nevada Department of Transportation |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110527065208/http://www.nevadadot.com/Projects_and_Programs/Road_Projects/District_1_Construction_Report.aspx |archive-date = May 27, 2011 |url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist8/projects/15/I-15%20Brstw%20-STLN.revsd%206-2004%20copy.pdf |title = Interstate 15 Major Improvements |publisher = California Department of Transportation |url-status = dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070615184246/http://www.dot.ca.gov/dist8/projects/15/I-15%20Brstw%20-STLN.revsd%206-2004%20copy.pdf |archivedate = June 15, 2007 }}</ref> The portions in Arizona, Idaho and Montana have retained their rural, long-haul character. Although Arizona has also grown substantially since the construction of I-15, this [[highway]] serves only the [[Arizona Strip|isolated corner]] of northwestern Arizona.\n\nDue to this rapid area growth, the I-15 corridor is the focus of several [[mass transit]] projects. The [[Las Vegas Monorail]], ''[[FrontRunner]]'' [[Commuter rail in North America|commuter rail]] system and [[TRAX (light rail)|TRAX]] [[light rail]] in [[Salt Lake City]] are mass transit lines loosely parallel to I-15 that are now in operation.
