Nayyar also worked with developing lyricists such as [[Jan Nisar Akhtar]], [[Qamar Jalalabadi]], [[S. H. Bihari]] and Ahmed Wasi. He began the tradition of assigning full, three-minute songs to comedians. [[Om Prakash]] sang Nayyar's ''\"Churi Bane Kanta Bane\"'' in ''[[Jaali Note]]'' and ''Eent ki dukhi paan ka ikka'' in [[Howrah Bridge (Film)|Howrah Bridge]] and [[Johnny Walker (actor)|Johnny Walker]] sang ''\"Aye Dil Hai Mushkil Jeena Yahaan\"'' in ''[[C.I.D.

The song earned him the 1958 Filmfare Best Music Director Award. The last Nayyar song performed by Bhosle was ''\"Chain Se Humko Kabhi\"''. Intended for ''[[Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye]]'' (1973), disappeared in the film's final cut but won Bhosle the 1975 [[Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer]].

He made a brief comeback during the 1990s with ''Mangni'' and ''Nishchay'' in 1992 and ''Zid'' in 1994.\nO.P. Nayyar played a major part in shaping up Asha's career but Asha rarely mention it. She mentions S.D. Burman's name instead. Why OP and Asha parted away in 1974, both of them never talked about it.\n\n==Early life and career==\nNayyar was born in [[Lahore]], [[British India]] (present [[Pakistan]]). He then underwent music training.\nHe composed the background score for ''[[Kaneez (1949 film)|Kaneez]]'' (1949), and 1952's ''Aasmaan'' (produced by [[Dalsukh M. Pancholi]]), was his first film as music director. Nayyar then composed music for ''Chham Chhama Chham'' (1952) and ''[[Baaz]]'' (1953). Film producer, director and actor Guru Dutt enlisted him to compose and conduct music for ''[[Aar Paar]]'' (1954), ''[[Mr. & Mrs. '55]]'' (1955) and ''C.I.D.'' (1956). Nayyar's early work was primarily performed by Shamshad Begum, Geeta Dutt and Mohammed Rafi, with Asha Bhosle introduced in ''C.I.D.''\n\nIn 1957 Filmalaya introduced [[Nasir Hussain]], who wanted a composer to provide romantic scores for newcomers Shammi Kapoor and [[Ameeta]]. Nayyar's scores were featured in the Hussain films ''[[Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957 film)|Tumsa Nahin Dekha]]'' (1957) and ''[[Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon]]'' (1964). During the decade, state-controlled [[All India Radio]] banned most of Nayyar's songs because the broadcaster considered them too \"trendy\".<ref>[http://www.mohdrafi.com/meri-awaaz-suno/o-p-nayyar-immortal-relationship-with-mohammad-rafi.html O.P.Nayyar\u2019s immortal relationship with Mohammad Rafi | Rafians tribute to a true Maestro \u2013 Mohd Rafi].

Wasi interviewed Nayyar twice on [[Vividh Bharati]] and presented a series of six one-hour episodes, ''Mujhe Yaad Sab Hai Zaraa Zaraa'', about his life.\n\nHe had two brothers: P. P. (a physician) and G. P. (a retired army dentist in [[Secunderabad]],who passed away in 2010). Nayyar's wife, Saroj Mohini Nayyar, wrote the lyrics to ''\"Preetam Aan Milo\"'' (originally sung by C H Atma in 1945 which was used later in the film \"Mr & Mrs Fifty Five\" by Geeta Roy / Geeta Dutt). Estranged from his family, he requested that they be barred from his funeral. Nayyar had moved out of his Mumbai home, staying with a friend in [[Virar]] and then with a friend in [[Thane]]. He died on 28 January 2007, survived by his wife, three daughters and a son.

Nayyar also worked with developing lyricists such as [[Jan Nisar Akhtar]], [[Qamar Jalalabadi]], [[S. H. Bihari]] and Ahmed Wasi. He began the tradition of assigning full, three-minute songs to comedians. [[Om Prakash]] sang Nayyar's ''\"Churi Bane Kanta Bane\"'' in ''[[Jaali Note]]'' and ''Eent ki dukhi paan ka ikka'' in [[Howrah Bridge (Film)|Howrah Bridge]] and [[Johnny Walker (actor)|Johnny Walker]] sang ''\"Aye Dil Hai Mushkil Jeena Yahaan\"'' in ''[[C.I.D.

The song earned him the 1958 Filmfare Best Music Director Award. The last Nayyar song performed by Bhosle was ''\"Chain Se Humko Kabhi\"''. Intended for ''[[Pran Jaye Par Vachan Na Jaye]]'' (1973), disappeared in the film's final cut but won Bhosle the 1975 [[Filmfare Award for Best Female Playback Singer]].

He made a brief comeback during the 1990s with ''Mangni'' and ''Nishchay'' in 1992 and ''Zid'' in 1994.\nO.P. Nayyar played a major part in shaping up Asha's career but Asha rarely mention it. She mentions S.D. Burman's name instead. Why OP and Asha parted away in 1974, both of them never talked about it.\n\n==Early life and career==\nNayyar was born in [[Lahore]], [[British India]] (present [[Pakistan]]). He then underwent music training.\nHe composed the background score for ''[[Kaneez (1949 film)|Kaneez]]'' (1949), and 1952's ''Aasmaan'' (produced by [[Dalsukh M. Pancholi]]), was his first film as music director. Nayyar then composed music for ''Chham Chhama Chham'' (1952) and ''[[Baaz]]'' (1953). Film producer, director and actor Guru Dutt enlisted him to compose and conduct music for ''[[Aar Paar]]'' (1954), ''[[Mr. & Mrs. '55]]'' (1955) and ''C.I.D.'' (1956). Nayyar's early work was primarily performed by Shamshad Begum, Geeta Dutt and Mohammed Rafi, with Asha Bhosle introduced in ''C.I.D.''\n\nIn 1957 Filmalaya introduced [[Nasir Hussain]], who wanted a composer to provide romantic scores for newcomers Shammi Kapoor and [[Ameeta]]. Nayyar's scores were featured in the Hussain films ''[[Tumsa Nahin Dekha (1957 film)|Tumsa Nahin Dekha]]'' (1957) and ''[[Phir Wohi Dil Laya Hoon]]'' (1964). During the decade, state-controlled [[All India Radio]] banned most of Nayyar's songs because the broadcaster considered them too \"trendy\".<ref>[http://www.mohdrafi.com/meri-awaaz-suno/o-p-nayyar-immortal-relationship-with-mohammad-rafi.html O.P.Nayyar\u2019s immortal relationship with Mohammad Rafi | Rafians tribute to a true Maestro \u2013 Mohd Rafi].

Wasi interviewed Nayyar twice on [[Vividh Bharati]] and presented a series of six one-hour episodes, ''Mujhe Yaad Sab Hai Zaraa Zaraa'', about his life.\n\nHe had two brothers: P. P. (a physician) and G. P. (a retired army dentist in [[Secunderabad]],who passed away in 2010). Nayyar's wife, Saroj Mohini Nayyar, wrote the lyrics to ''\"Preetam Aan Milo\"'' (originally sung by C H Atma in 1945 which was used later in the film \"Mr & Mrs Fifty Five\" by Geeta Roy / Geeta Dutt). Estranged from his family, he requested that they be barred from his funeral. Nayyar had moved out of his Mumbai home, staying with a friend in [[Virar]] and then with a friend in [[Thane]]. He died on 28 January 2007, survived by his wife, three daughters and a son.

{"title_page": "Induction cooking", "text_new": "{{Short description|Direct induction heating of cooking vessels}}\n[[File:Kookplaat inductie.JPG|thumb|alt=Glassy smooth featureless rectangular cooktop set nearly flush with a kitchen counter|Top view of an induction cooktop]]\n'''Induction cooking''' is performed using direct [[induction heating]] of [[cooking vessel]]s, rather than relying on indirect [[radiation]], [[convection]], or [[thermal conduction]]. Induction cooking allows high power and very rapid increases in temperature to be achieved, and changes in heat settings are instantaneous.<ref name=acee/>\nEat lots of cookies they make you strong\n\nIn an induction [[cooktop]] (\"induction hob\" or \"induction stove\"), a coil of copper wire is placed under the cooking pot and an [[alternating current|alternating electric current]] is passed through it. The resulting oscillating [[magnetic field]] [[wireless power transfer|wirelessly]] induces an electrical current in the pot.  This large [[eddy current]] flowing through the resistance of the pot results in resistive heating.\n\nFor nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as [[cast iron]] or some [[stainless steel]]s. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current;  \"all metal\" induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.\n\nInduction cooking has good electrical coupling between the pan and the coil and is thus quite efficient, which means it puts less [[waste heat]] into the kitchen, can be quickly turned on and off, and has safety advantages compared to gas stoves. Cooktops are also usually easy to clean, because the cooktop itself does not get very hot.\n\n==Cooking properties==\n\n[[File:Induction Cooktop Rolling Boil.jpg|thumb|alt=A pot of boiling water atop newspaper on an induction cooking surface|An induction cooking surface boiling water through several layers of newsprint. The paper is undamaged since heat is produced only in the bottom of the pot]]\n\n===Power and control===\nInduction cooking provides fast heating, improved [[thermal efficiency]], and more consistent heating than cooking by thermal conduction.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g0Z4CwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA682&dq=induction%20cooking&pg=PA682#v=onepage&q=induction%20cooking&f=false |title = Wireless Power Transfer|isbn = 9788793237629|last1 = Agbinya|first1 = Johnson I.|date = 2015-12-01}}</ref> The induction elements commonly have heating performance more comparable to a commercial [[gas burner]], but are significantly more energy-efficient. Induction cooking is generally digitally controlled which provides precise control of the power and cooking temperature. This makes it possible to boil a pot rapidly, and then keep a pot just simmering.\n\n===Safety===\nThe unit can detect whether cookware is present by monitoring power delivered. As with other electric ceramic cooking surfaces, a maximum pan size may be specified by the manufacturer, and a minimum size is also stated.\n\nThe control system shuts down the element if a pot is not present or not large enough. If a pan boils dry it can get extremely hot- a thermostat in the surface will turn off the power if it senses overheating to prevent cooker failures and potential fires.\n\n===Cooker surface===\nThe surface of the cooker is heated only by the pot and so does not usually reach a hazardous temperature. Induction cookers are easy to clean because the cooking surface is flat and smooth and does not get hot enough to make spilled food burn and stick.\n\nInduction cookers generally have low-thermal expansion glass ceramic tops that can be damaged by sufficient impact although they are required to meet minimum specified product safety standards with regard to impact.<ref>Hans Bach, Dieter Krause, ''Low thermal expansion glass ceramics'', Springer, 2005 {{ISBN|3-540-24111-6}} page 77, lists IEC, UL, Canadian, Australian and other standards with impact resistance requirements</ref> Aluminum foil can melt onto the top and cause permanent damage or cracking of the top. Surfaces can be scratched by sliding pans across the cooking surface.\n\n===Noise===\nSome noise is generated by an internal cooling fan. Also, [[electromagnetically induced acoustic noise and vibration|audible electromagnetically induced acoustic noise]] (a high pitched hum or buzz) may be produced by cookware, especially at high power, if the cookware has loose parts or if the multi-ply layers of the pot are not well bonded to each other; cookware with welded-in cladding layers and solid riveting is less likely to produce this type of noise. Some users are more capable of hearing or more sensitive to this high-frequency whine.\n\n===Other considerations===\nSome cooking techniques available when cooking over a flame are not applicable. Persons with implanted [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]]s or other electronic medical implants are usually instructed to avoid sources of magnetic fields; the medical literature seems to suggest that proximity to induction cooking surfaces is safe, but individuals with such implants should always check first with their cardiologists. Radio receivers near the induction-cooking unit may pick up some [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nBecause the cook top is shallow compared to a gas-fired or electrical coil cooking surface, wheelchair access can be improved; the user's legs can be below the counter height and the user's arms can reach over the top.\n\n===Efficiency===\n\nThe 2014 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings concluded that \"induction cooking is not always the most efficient method of cooking. When tested with a large cooking vessel, the efficiency of conventional electric\ntechnology was measured to be higher (83%) than that of induction cooking (77%). Yet the\nefficiency of conventional cooking appliances was shown to be highly dependent on the size of\nthe cooking vessel.\"<ref>https://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf</ref> Cooking methods that use flames or hot heating elements have a significantly higher loss to the ambient; induction heating directly heats the pot. Because the induction effect does not directly heat the air around the vessel, induction cooking results in further energy efficiencies. Cooling air is blown through the electronics beneath the surface but it is only slightly warm.\n\nThe purpose of a cooktop is to prepare food; for example, long periods of simmering may be required.  A rational measure of efficiency would be to compare the actual energy input to the cooktop to some theoretical value required to prepare the specified food.  Since experiments to make these measurements would be difficult to replicate, energy efficiency measurements that are published concentrate on the ability of a cooktop to transfer energy to a metal test block, which is much easier to measure in a repeatable fashion.\n\nEnergy transfer efficiency, as defined by [[U.S. Department of Energy]]  (DOE), is the percentage of the energy consumed by a cooker that, at the end of a simulated cooking cycle, appears to have been transferred as heat to a standardized aluminum test block.\n\nThe DOE test cycle starts with both the block and the cooktop at room temperature: 77&nbsp;\u00b0F \u00b1 9&nbsp;\u00b0F (25&nbsp;\u00b0C \u00b1 5&nbsp;\u00b0C). The cooktop is then switched to maximum heating power. When the test block temperature reaches + 144&nbsp;\u00b0F (+80&nbsp;\u00b0C) above the initial room temperature, the cooktop power is immediately reduced to 25% \u00b1 5% of its maximum power. After 15 minutes of operation at this lower power setting, the cooktop is turned off and the heat energy in the test block is measured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title10-vol3/pdf/CFR-2011-title10-vol3-part430-subpartB-appI.pdf#page=6|title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Chapter II, Subchapter D, Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix I: Uniform test method for measuring the energy consumption of conventional ranges, conventional cooking tops, conventional ovens, and microwave ovens|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref> Efficiency is given by the ratio between energy in the block and input (electric) energy.\n\nSuch a test, using a combination of two different power levels, was conceived to mimic real life use. Wasted energy terms such as residual unused heat (retained by solid hot-plates, ceramic or coil at the end of the test), and losses from convection and radiation by hot surfaces (including the ones of the block itself) are simply disregarded and don't contribute to efficiency.\n\nIn typical cooking, the energy delivered by the cooker is only partly used to heat the food up to temperature; once that has occurred, all the subsequent energy input is delivered to the air as loss through steam or convection and radiation from the pan sides. Since there is no increase in the food temperature, the DOE test procedure would consider the efficiency substantially zero. Cooking procedures such as [[Reduction (cooking)|reduction]] of a sauce, [[braising]] meat, simmering, and so on are significant uses of a cooker, but efficiency of these practices is not modelled by the DOE test procedure.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 DOE developed and proposed new test procedures for cooking products to allow direct comparison of energy transfer efficiency measurements among induction, electric resistance, and gas cooking tops and ranges. The procedures use a new hybrid test block made of aluminum and stainless steel, so it is suitable for tests on induction cookers. The proposed rule lists results of real lab tests conducted with the hybrid block. For comparable (large) cooking elements the following efficiencies were measured with \u00b10.5% repeatability: 70.7% - 73.6% for induction, 71.9% for electric coil, 43.9% for gas. Summarizing the results of several tests, DOE affirms that \"induction units have an average efficiency of 72.2%, not significantly higher than the 69.9% efficiency of smooth\u2014electric resistance units, or the 71.2% of electric coil units\".<ref name=\"DOE2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-12-03/pdf/2014-28212.pdf#page=17 |title=Federal Register, Vol. 79 No. 232, December 3 2014, Part III, Department of Energy, Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Conventional Cooking Products; Proposed Rule|format=PDF |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref> Moreover, DOE reminds that the 84% induction efficiency, cited in previous Technical Support Documents, was not measured by DOE laboratories but just \"referenced from an external test study\" performed in 1992.<ref name=\"DOE2014\" />\n\nIn addition independent tests conducted by manufacturers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |title=Electrolux sustainability |format=pdf |accessdate=2016-09-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919100541/http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |archivedate=2016-09-19 |url-status=dead }} See slide # 57</ref>  research laboratories<ref name=acee>{{cite web|url=http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf |title=Induction Cooking Technology Design and Assessment; M.

It can be raised only by using special pots with fins whose first design and commercialization came years ago,<ref name=\"gasefficiency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |title=Improving Range-Top Efficiency with Specialized Vessels |author=Greg Sorensen |author2=David Zabrowski |date=August 2009 |publisher=Appliance Magazine |accessdate=2010-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154301/http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> but that have been recently rediscovered, redesigned in a different way and put again on the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |title=Oxford-designed Flare pan uses 40 per cent less heat than conventional pans \u2014 Department of Engineering Science \u2014 University of Oxford |accessdate=2016-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928005335/http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |archive-date=2016-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> So for environmental considerations dealing with induction versus gas, a 40% gas efficiency will be used.\n\nWhen comparing with gas, the relative cost of electrical and gas energy, and the efficiency of the process by which electricity is generated, affect both overall environmental efficiency<ref>[http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/appliances/cookers.aspx Shopping guide to Gas & Electric Cookers, Ovens & Hobs, from Ethical Consumer]. \"The low CO<sub>2</sub> choice is pretty much always gas, where it is available. Although gas ovens and hobs use more energy, gas generates less carbon dioxide per kWh.\"</ref> (as explained in more detail below) and cost to the user.\n\n===Kitchen ventilation===\nEnergy lost from gas cooking heats the kitchen, whereas with induction cooking, the losses are much lower. This results in less heating of the kitchen itself and can affect the amount of ventilation required.\n\nGas cooking efficiencies may be lower if waste heat generation is taken into account.  Especially in restaurants, gas cooking can significantly increase the ambient temperature in localized areas.  Not only may extra cooling be required, but zoned venting may be needed to adequately condition hot areas without overcooling other areas.  Costs must be considered on an individual situation due to numerous variables in temperature differences, facility layout or openness, and heat generation schedule.  Induction cooking using grid electricity may surpass gas efficiencies when waste heat and air comfort are quantified.\n\nIn a commercial setting, induction cookers do not require safety interlocks between the fuel source and the ventilation, as may be required with gas systems.\n\n{{anchor|inductive_coupling_coils}}\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Induktionskochfeld Spule.jpg|thumb|Inside view of an induction cooker: the large copper coil forms the magnetic field, a cooling fan is visible below it, and power supply and [[line filter]] surround the coil. In the centre of the coil is a temperature sensor, covered in white [[thermal grease]]]]\n[[File:InductionsStove 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Ventilation slots visible. The unit has a small depth compared to the width of the stove|Side view of an induction stove]]\nAn induction cooker transfers electrical energy by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] from a coil of wire into a  metal vessel that must be [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]. The coil is mounted under the cooking surface, and a high frequency (e.g. 24&nbsp;kHz)  [[alternating current]] is passed through it. The current in the coil creates a dynamic magnetic field. When an [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive]] pot is brought close to the cooking surface, and the pan is thicker than the [[skin depth]], the magnetic field induces large [[eddy current]]s in the pot. The eddy currents flow through the [[electrical resistance]] of the pot to produce heat through [[Joule heating]]; the pot then in turn heats its contents by [[heat conduction]].\n\nThe cooking vessel typically needs to be made of a suitable [[stainless steel]] or [[iron]]. The increased [[magnetic permeability]] of the material decreases the [[skin depth]], concentrating the current near the surface of the metal, and so the electrical resistance will be further increased. Some energy will be dissipated wastefully by the current flowing through the resistance of the coil. To reduce the skin effect and consequent heat generation in the coil, it is made from [[litz wire]], which is a bundle of many smaller insulated wires in parallel. The coil has many turns, while the bottom of the pot effectively forms a single shorted turn. This forms a [[transformer]] that steps down the voltage and steps up the current. The resistance of the pot, as viewed from the primary coil, appears larger. In turn, most of the energy becomes heat in the high-resistance steel, while the driving coil stays cool.\n\nOften a thermostat is present to measure the temperature of the pan. This helps prevent the pan from severely overheating if accidentally heated empty or boiled dry, but also can allow the induction cooker to maintain a target temperature.\n\n===Applications===\n\nInduction equipment may be a built-in surface, part of a range, or a standalone surface unit. Built-in and rangetop units typically have multiple elements, the equivalent of separate burners on a gas-fueled range. Stand-alone induction modules are usually single-element, or sometimes have dual elements. All such elements share a basic design: an electromagnet sealed beneath a heat-resisting [[glass-ceramic]] sheet that is easily cleaned. The pot is placed on the ceramic glass surface and begins to heat up, along with its contents.\n\nIn [[Japan]], some models of [[rice cooker]]s are powered by induction. In Hong Kong, power companies list a number of models. Asian manufacturers have taken the lead in producing inexpensive single-induction-zone surfaces; efficient, low-waste-heat units are advantageous in densely populated cities with little living space per family, as many Asian cities are. Induction cookers are less frequently used in other parts of the world.\n\nInduction ranges may be applicable in commercial restaurant kitchens. Electric cooking avoids the cost of natural gas piping and in some jurisdictions may allow simpler ventilation and fire suppression equipment to be installed.<ref>Roger Fields, ''Restaurant Success by the Numbers: A Money-Guy's Guide to Opening the Next Hot Spot'', Random House of Canada, 2007 {{ISBN|1-58008-663-2}}, pp. 144\u2013145</ref> Drawbacks for commercial use include possible breakages of the glass cook-top, higher initial cost and the requirement for magnetic cookware.\n\n===Controls===\n\nThe [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] properties of a steel vessel concentrate the induced current in a thin layer near its surface, which results in a strong heating effect. In [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic materials]] like aluminum, the magnetic field penetrates deeper, and the induced current encounters little resistance in the metal.<ref>{{cite book|url-status=dead|chapter=A comparative study of resonant inverter topologies used in induction cookers|author1=Llorente, S. |title=APEC.

At least one high-frequency \"all-metal\" cooker is available, that works with lower efficiency on non-ferromagnetic metal cookware.\n\nThe cooking surface is made of a [[glass-ceramic]] material which is a poor heat conductor, so only a little heat is lost through the bottom of the pot. In normal operation the cooking surface stays significantly cooler than with other stove cooking methods, but still needs to cool down before it can be safely touched.\n\nUnits may have one, two, three, four or five induction zones, but four (normally in a 30-inch-wide unit) is the most common in the US and Europe. Two coils are most common in Hong Kong and three are most common in Japan. Some have touch-sensitive controls. Some induction stoves have a memory setting, one per element, to control the time that heat is applied. At least one manufacturer makes a \"zoneless\" induction cooking surface with multiple induction coils. This allows up to five utensils to be used at once anywhere on the cooking surface, not just on pre-defined zones.<ref>[http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf DeDietrich \"Piano\" cooktop specifications, retrieved 2012 May 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032647/http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}, dedietrich.co.uk</ref>\n\nSmall stand-alone portable induction cookers are relatively inexpensive, priced from around {{US$|20}} in some markets.\n\n===Cookware===\n\n[[File:Induction-label-de.svg|thumb|Cookware may carry a symbol that identifies it as compatible with an induction cooktop]]\n\nCookware must be compatible with induction heating; in most models, only ferrous metal can be heated. Cookware should have a flat bottom since the magnetic field drops rapidly with distance from the surface. (Special and costly wok-shaped tops are available for use with round-bottom [[wok]]s.) Induction disks are metal plates that are heated by induction and heat non-ferrous pots by thermal contact, but these are much less efficient than ferrous cooking vessels.\n\nInduction compatible cookware for an induction cooking surface can nearly always be used on other stoves. Some cookware or packaging is marked with symbols to indicate compatibility with induction, gas, or electric heat. Induction cooking surfaces work well with any pans with a high ferrous metal content at the base. Cast iron pans and any black metal or iron pans will work on an induction cooking surface. Stainless steel pans will work on an induction cooking surface if the base of the pan is a magnetic grade of stainless steel. If a magnet sticks well to the sole of the pan, it will work on an induction cooking surface. An \"all-metal\" cooker will work with non-ferrous cookware, but available models are limited.\n\nAluminum or copper alone does not work on an induction stove because of the materials\u2019 [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic]] and [[resistivity|electrical]] properties.<ref name=Moreland73>W. C. Moreland, ''The Induction Range: Its Performance and Its Development Problems'', IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, vol. TA-9, no. 1, January/February 1973 pages 81\u201386</ref> Aluminum and copper cookware are more conductive than steel, but the [[skin depth]] in these materials is larger since they are non-magnetic. The current flows in a thicker layer in the metal, encounters less resistance and so produces less heat. The induction cooker will not work efficiently with such pots. However, aluminum and copper are desirable in cookware, since they conduct heat better. Because of this 'tri-ply' pans often have an induction-compatible skin of stainless steel containing a layer of thermally conductive aluminum.\n\nFor frying, a pan with a base that is a good heat conductor is needed to spread the heat quickly and evenly. The sole of the pan will be either a steel plate pressed into the aluminum, or a layer of stainless steel over the aluminum. The high thermal conductivity of aluminum pans makes the temperature more uniform across the pan. Stainless frying pans with an aluminum base will not have the same temperature at their sides as an aluminum sided pan will have. Cast iron frying pans work well with induction cooking surfaces but the material is not as good a thermal conductor as aluminum.\n\nWhen boiling water, the circulating water spreads the heat and prevents hot spots. For products such as sauces, it is important that at least the base of the pan incorporates a good heat conducting material to spread the heat evenly. For delicate products such as thick sauces, a pan with aluminum throughout is better, since the heat flows up the sides through the aluminum, allowing the cook to heat the sauce rapidly but evenly.\n\n[[File:Foil on induction cooktop.jpg|thumb|alt=Aluminum foil in a square Pyrex dish of water, with a tear where the foil has melted| Household foil is much thinner than the skin depth in aluminum at the frequencies used by an induction cooker. Here the foil has melted where it was exposed to the air after steam formed under it. Cooking surface manufacturers prohibit the use of aluminum foil in contact with an induction cooking surface]]\n\nThe heat that can be produced in a pot is a function of the surface resistance. A higher surface resistance produces more heat for similar currents. This is a \u201cfigure of merit\u201d that can be used to rank the suitability of a material for induction heating. The surface resistance in a thick metal conductor is proportional to the resistivity divided by the skin depth. Where the thickness is less than the skin depth, the actual thickness can be used to calculate surface resistance.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some common materials are listed in this table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Skin depth at 24&nbsp;kHz<ref name=Moreland73/>\n!

Since the skin depth is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency, this suggests that much higher frequencies would be required to obtain equivalent heating in a copper pot as in an iron pot at 24&nbsp;kHz. Such high frequencies are not feasible with inexpensive power semiconductors; in 1973 the [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s used were limited to no more than 40&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=Moreland73/> Even a thin layer of copper on the bottom of a steel cooking vessel will shield the steel from the magnetic field and make it unusable for an induction top.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some additional heat is created by [[hysteresis loss]]es in the pot due to its ferromagnetic nature, but this creates less than ten percent of the total heat generated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|title=AN9012 Induction Heating System Topology Review|author=Fairchild Semiconductors|date=July 2000|accessdate=2009-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724205258/http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===\"All-metal\" models===\n\nNew types of power semiconductors and low-loss coil designs have made an all-metal cooker possible.\n\nPanasonic Corporation in 2009 developed a consumer induction cooker that uses a higher-frequency magnetic field, and a different oscillator circuit design, to allow use with non-ferrous metals.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Fujita |first=Atsushi |author2=Sadakata, Hideki |author3=Hirota, Izuo |author4=Omori, Hideki |author5=Nakaoka, Mutsuo |title=Latest developments of high-frequency series load resonant inverter type built-in cooktops for induction heated all metallic appliances |conference=Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, 2009.

The induction cooker was shown heating a pot of water with a newspaper placed between the stove and the pot, to demonstrate the convenience and safety. This unit, however, was never put into production.\n\nModern implementation in the USA dates from the early 1970s, with work done at the Research & Development Center of [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] at Churchill Borough, near [[Pittsburgh]],<ref name=Moreland73/> That work was first put on public display at the 1971 [[National Association of Home Builders]] convention in Houston, Texas, as part of the Westinghouse Consumer Products Division display.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The stand-alone single-burner range was named the Cool Top Induction Range. It used paralleled [[Delco Electronics]] transistors developed for automotive electronic ignition systems to drive the 25&nbsp;kHz current.\n\n[[File:Westinghouse CT-2 Induction Range photograph 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The Westinghouse Electric CT-2; the first production induction range from 1973]]\nWestinghouse decided to make a few hundred production units to develop the market. Those were named Cool Top 2 (CT2) Induction ranges. The development work was done at the same R&D location by a team led by Bill Moreland and Terry Malarkey. The ranges were priced at $1,500 ($8,260 in 2017 dollars), including a set of high quality cookware made of Quadraply, a new laminate of stainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum and another layer of stainless steel (outside to inside).\n\nProduction took place in 1973 through to 1975 and stopped, coincidentally, with the sale of Westinghouse Consumer Products Division to [[White Consolidated Industries]] Inc.\n\nCT2 had four \"burners\" of about 1,600 watts each, measured by calorimetry. The range top was a [[Pyroceram]] ceramic sheet surrounded by a stainless-steel bezel, upon which four magnetic sliders adjusted four corresponding [[potentiometer]]s set below. That design, using no through-holes, made the range impervious to spills. The electronics section was made of four identical modules which were cooled by a single quiet, low-speed, high-torque fan.\n\nIn each of the electronics modules, the 240 V, 60&nbsp;Hz domestic line power was converted to between 20 V to 200 V of continuously variable DC by a phase-controlled [[rectifier]]. That DC power was in turn converted to 27&nbsp;kHz 30&nbsp;A (peak) AC by two arrays of six paralleled [[Motorola]] automotive-ignition transistors in a half-bridge configuration driving a series-resonant [[LC circuit|LC]] [[oscillator]], of which the inductor component was the induction-heating coil and its load, the cooking pan. The circuit design, largely by Ray Mackenzie,<ref>{{US Patent|3889090|Induction Heat Cooking Apparatus|Raymond W Mackenzie}}</ref> successfully dealt with certain bothersome overload problems.\n\nControl electronics included functions such as protection against over-heated cook-pans and overloads.

Numerous patents were also issued. CT2 won several awards, including Industrial Research Magazine's IR-100 1972 best-product award <ref>[http://www.rdmag.com/RD100SearchResults.aspx?&strCompany=Westinghouse&Type=C Archive, retrieved 2012 Aug 22], rdmag.com {{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and a citation from the United States Steel Association. [[Raymond Baxter]] demonstrated the CT2 on the [[BBC]] series ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''. He showed how the CT2 could cook through a slab of ice.\n\n[[Kenmore Appliances|Sears Kenmore]] sold a free-standing oven/stove with four induction-cooking surfaces in the mid-1980s (Model Number 103.9647910). The unit also featured a [[self-cleaning oven]], solid-state kitchen timer and capacitive-touch control buttons (advanced for its time). The units were more expensive than standard cooking surfaces.\n\nIn 2009 [[Panasonic]] developed an all-metal induction cooker that used frequencies up to 120&nbsp;kHz,<ref>https://www.sefa.com/panasonic-takes-induction-next-level/ \"Panasonic takes induction to the next level\", retrieved September 19, 2018</ref> three to five times higher than other cooktops,  to work with non-ferrous metal cookware.\n\n===Vendors===\n\nThe market for induction stoves is dominated by German manufacturers.\n\nSingle ring portable hobs have become popular in the UK, with prices as low as \u00a330 from discounters.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe European induction cooking market for hotels, restaurants and other caterers is primarily satisfied by smaller specialist commercial induction catering equipment manufacturers.\n\nTaiwanese and Japanese electronics companies are the dominant players in induction cooking for East Asia. After aggressive promotions by utilities in HK, many local brands emerged. Their power and ratings are high, more than 2,800 watts. Some of these companies have also started marketing in the West. However, the product range sold in Western markets is a subset of that in their domestic market; some Japanese electronics manufacturers only sell domestically.\n\nIn the United States, as of early 2013 there are over five dozen brands of induction-cooking equipment available, including both built-in and countertop residential equipment and commercial-grade equipment.  Even restricting to build-in residential-use units, there are over two dozen brands being sold; residential countertop units add another two-dozen-plus brands to the count.\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders in 2012 estimated that, in the United States, induction cooktops held only 4% of sales, compared to gas and other electric cooktops.<ref>[http://www.nahb.org/generic.aspx?genericContentID=183725&fromGSA=1 ''Kitchen Appliance Upgrades that Shine'', retrieved 2012 Aug 15], nahb.org{{dead link|date=August 2015}}</ref> The global induction cooktops market was estimated at $9.16 ml in value during 2015 and is set to grow to $13.53 mil by 2022.\n\nIn April 2010, ''The New York Times'' reported that \"In an independent survey last summer by the market research company Mintel of 2,000 Internet users who own appliances, only 5 percent of respondents said they had an induction range or cooktop. . . .

Induction cooking allows high power and very rapid increases in temperature to be achieved, and changes in heat settings are instantaneous.<ref name=acee/>\n\nIn an induction [[cooktop]] (\"induction hob\" or \"induction stove\"), a coil of copper wire is placed under the cooking pot and an [[alternating current|alternating electric current]] is passed through it. The resulting oscillating [[magnetic field]] [[wireless power transfer|wirelessly]] induces an electrical current in the pot.  This large [[eddy current]] flowing through the resistance of the pot results in resistive heating.\n\nFor nearly all models of induction cooktops, a cooking vessel must be made of, or contain, a ferrous metal such as [[cast iron]] or some [[stainless steel]]s. The iron in the pot concentrates the current to produce heat in the metal. If the metal is too thin, or does not provide enough resistance to current flow, heating will not be effective. Most induction tops will not heat copper or aluminum vessels because the magnetic field cannot produce a concentrated current;  \"all metal\" induction tops use much higher frequencies to overcome that effect. Any vessel can be used if placed on a suitable metal disk which functions as a conventional hotplate.\n\nInduction cooking has good electrical coupling between the pan and the coil and is thus quite efficient, which means it puts less [[waste heat]] into the kitchen, can be quickly turned on and off, and has safety advantages compared to gas stoves. Cooktops are also usually easy to clean, because the cooktop itself does not get very hot.\n\n==Cooking properties==\n\n[[File:Induction Cooktop Rolling Boil.jpg|thumb|alt=A pot of boiling water atop newspaper on an induction cooking surface|An induction cooking surface boiling water through several layers of newsprint. The paper is undamaged since heat is produced only in the bottom of the pot]]\n\n===Power and control===\nInduction cooking provides fast heating, improved [[thermal efficiency]], and more consistent heating than cooking by thermal conduction.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=g0Z4CwAAQBAJ&lpg=PA682&dq=induction%20cooking&pg=PA682#v=onepage&q=induction%20cooking&f=false |title = Wireless Power Transfer|isbn = 9788793237629|last1 = Agbinya|first1 = Johnson I.|date = 2015-12-01}}</ref> The induction elements commonly have heating performance more comparable to a commercial [[gas burner]], but are significantly more energy-efficient. Induction cooking is generally digitally controlled which provides precise control of the power and cooking temperature. This makes it possible to boil a pot rapidly, and then keep a pot just simmering.\n\n===Safety===\nThe unit can detect whether cookware is present by monitoring power delivered. As with other electric ceramic cooking surfaces, a maximum pan size may be specified by the manufacturer, and a minimum size is also stated.\n\nThe control system shuts down the element if a pot is not present or not large enough. If a pan boils dry it can get extremely hot- a thermostat in the surface will turn off the power if it senses overheating to prevent cooker failures and potential fires.\n\n===Cooker surface===\nThe surface of the cooker is heated only by the pot and so does not usually reach a hazardous temperature. Induction cookers are easy to clean because the cooking surface is flat and smooth and does not get hot enough to make spilled food burn and stick.\n\nInduction cookers generally have low-thermal expansion glass ceramic tops that can be damaged by sufficient impact although they are required to meet minimum specified product safety standards with regard to impact.<ref>Hans Bach, Dieter Krause, ''Low thermal expansion glass ceramics'', Springer, 2005 {{ISBN|3-540-24111-6}} page 77, lists IEC, UL, Canadian, Australian and other standards with impact resistance requirements</ref> Aluminum foil can melt onto the top and cause permanent damage or cracking of the top. Surfaces can be scratched by sliding pans across the cooking surface.\n\n===Noise===\nSome noise is generated by an internal cooling fan. Also, [[electromagnetically induced acoustic noise and vibration|audible electromagnetically induced acoustic noise]] (a high pitched hum or buzz) may be produced by cookware, especially at high power, if the cookware has loose parts or if the multi-ply layers of the pot are not well bonded to each other; cookware with welded-in cladding layers and solid riveting is less likely to produce this type of noise. Some users are more capable of hearing or more sensitive to this high-frequency whine.\n\n===Other considerations===\nSome cooking techniques available when cooking over a flame are not applicable. Persons with implanted [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]]s or other electronic medical implants are usually instructed to avoid sources of magnetic fields; the medical literature seems to suggest that proximity to induction cooking surfaces is safe, but individuals with such implants should always check first with their cardiologists. Radio receivers near the induction-cooking unit may pick up some [[electromagnetic interference]].\n\nBecause the cook top is shallow compared to a gas-fired or electrical coil cooking surface, wheelchair access can be improved; the user's legs can be below the counter height and the user's arms can reach over the top.\n\n===Efficiency===\n\nThe 2014 ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Buildings concluded that \"induction cooking is not always the most efficient method of cooking. When tested with a large cooking vessel, the efficiency of conventional electric\ntechnology was measured to be higher (83%) than that of induction cooking (77%). Yet the\nefficiency of conventional cooking appliances was shown to be highly dependent on the size of\nthe cooking vessel.\"<ref>https://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf</ref> Cooking methods that use flames or hot heating elements have a significantly higher loss to the ambient; induction heating directly heats the pot. Because the induction effect does not directly heat the air around the vessel, induction cooking results in further energy efficiencies. Cooling air is blown through the electronics beneath the surface but it is only slightly warm.\n\nThe purpose of a cooktop is to prepare food; for example, long periods of simmering may be required.  A rational measure of efficiency would be to compare the actual energy input to the cooktop to some theoretical value required to prepare the specified food.  Since experiments to make these measurements would be difficult to replicate, energy efficiency measurements that are published concentrate on the ability of a cooktop to transfer energy to a metal test block, which is much easier to measure in a repeatable fashion.\n\nEnergy transfer efficiency, as defined by [[U.S. Department of Energy]]  (DOE), is the percentage of the energy consumed by a cooker that, at the end of a simulated cooking cycle, appears to have been transferred as heat to a standardized aluminum test block.\n\nThe DOE test cycle starts with both the block and the cooktop at room temperature: 77&nbsp;\u00b0F \u00b1 9&nbsp;\u00b0F (25&nbsp;\u00b0C \u00b1 5&nbsp;\u00b0C). The cooktop is then switched to maximum heating power. When the test block temperature reaches + 144&nbsp;\u00b0F (+80&nbsp;\u00b0C) above the initial room temperature, the cooktop power is immediately reduced to 25% \u00b1 5% of its maximum power. After 15 minutes of operation at this lower power setting, the cooktop is turned off and the heat energy in the test block is measured.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2011-title10-vol3/pdf/CFR-2011-title10-vol3-part430-subpartB-appI.pdf#page=6|title=Code of Federal Regulations, Title 10, Chapter II, Subchapter D, Part 430, Subpart B, Appendix I: Uniform test method for measuring the energy consumption of conventional ranges, conventional cooking tops, conventional ovens, and microwave ovens|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-09-15}}</ref> Efficiency is given by the ratio between energy in the block and input (electric) energy.\n\nSuch a test, using a combination of two different power levels, was conceived to mimic real life use. Wasted energy terms such as residual unused heat (retained by solid hot-plates, ceramic or coil at the end of the test), and losses from convection and radiation by hot surfaces (including the ones of the block itself) are simply disregarded and don't contribute to efficiency.\n\nIn typical cooking, the energy delivered by the cooker is only partly used to heat the food up to temperature; once that has occurred, all the subsequent energy input is delivered to the air as loss through steam or convection and radiation from the pan sides. Since there is no increase in the food temperature, the DOE test procedure would consider the efficiency substantially zero. Cooking procedures such as [[Reduction (cooking)|reduction]] of a sauce, [[braising]] meat, simmering, and so on are significant uses of a cooker, but efficiency of these practices is not modelled by the DOE test procedure.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 DOE developed and proposed new test procedures for cooking products to allow direct comparison of energy transfer efficiency measurements among induction, electric resistance, and gas cooking tops and ranges. The procedures use a new hybrid test block made of aluminum and stainless steel, so it is suitable for tests on induction cookers. The proposed rule lists results of real lab tests conducted with the hybrid block. For comparable (large) cooking elements the following efficiencies were measured with \u00b10.5% repeatability: 70.7% - 73.6% for induction, 71.9% for electric coil, 43.9% for gas. Summarizing the results of several tests, DOE affirms that \"induction units have an average efficiency of 72.2%, not significantly higher than the 69.9% efficiency of smooth\u2014electric resistance units, or the 71.2% of electric coil units\".<ref name=\"DOE2014\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-12-03/pdf/2014-28212.pdf#page=17 |title=Federal Register, Vol. 79 No. 232, December 3 2014, Part III, Department of Energy, Energy Conservation Program: Test Procedures for Conventional Cooking Products; Proposed Rule|format=PDF |accessdate=2016-03-14}}</ref> Moreover, DOE reminds that the 84% induction efficiency, cited in previous Technical Support Documents, was not measured by DOE laboratories but just \"referenced from an external test study\" performed in 1992.<ref name=\"DOE2014\" />\n\nIn addition independent tests conducted by manufacturers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |title=Electrolux sustainability |format=pdf |accessdate=2016-09-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919100541/http://www.ima.kth.se/utb/MJ2663/Electrolux.pdf#page=57 |archivedate=2016-09-19 |url-status=dead }} See slide # 57</ref>  research laboratories<ref name=acee>{{cite web|url=http://aceee.org/files/proceedings/2014/data/papers/9-702.pdf |title=Induction Cooking Technology Design and Assessment; M.

It can be raised only by using special pots with fins whose first design and commercialization came years ago,<ref name=\"gasefficiency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |title=Improving Range-Top Efficiency with Specialized Vessels |author=Greg Sorensen |author2=David Zabrowski |date=August 2009 |publisher=Appliance Magazine |accessdate=2010-08-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154301/http://www.appliancemagazine.com/editorial.php?article=2257&zone=114&first=1 |archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> but that have been recently rediscovered, redesigned in a different way and put again on the market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |title=Oxford-designed Flare pan uses 40 per cent less heat than conventional pans \u2014 Department of Engineering Science \u2014 University of Oxford |accessdate=2016-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160928005335/http://www.eng.ox.ac.uk/about/news/oxford-designed-flare-pan-uses-40-per-cent-less-heat-than-conventional-pans |archive-date=2016-09-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> So for environmental considerations dealing with induction versus gas, a 40% gas efficiency will be used.\n\nWhen comparing with gas, the relative cost of electrical and gas energy, and the efficiency of the process by which electricity is generated, affect both overall environmental efficiency<ref>[http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/buyersguides/appliances/cookers.aspx Shopping guide to Gas & Electric Cookers, Ovens & Hobs, from Ethical Consumer]. \"The low CO<sub>2</sub> choice is pretty much always gas, where it is available. Although gas ovens and hobs use more energy, gas generates less carbon dioxide per kWh.\"</ref> (as explained in more detail below) and cost to the user.\n\n===Kitchen ventilation===\nEnergy lost from gas cooking heats the kitchen, whereas with induction cooking, the losses are much lower. This results in less heating of the kitchen itself and can affect the amount of ventilation required.\n\nGas cooking efficiencies may be lower if waste heat generation is taken into account.  Especially in restaurants, gas cooking can significantly increase the ambient temperature in localized areas.  Not only may extra cooling be required, but zoned venting may be needed to adequately condition hot areas without overcooling other areas.  Costs must be considered on an individual situation due to numerous variables in temperature differences, facility layout or openness, and heat generation schedule.  Induction cooking using grid electricity may surpass gas efficiencies when waste heat and air comfort are quantified.\n\nIn a commercial setting, induction cookers do not require safety interlocks between the fuel source and the ventilation, as may be required with gas systems.\n\n{{anchor|inductive_coupling_coils}}\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Induktionskochfeld Spule.jpg|thumb|Inside view of an induction cooker: the large copper coil forms the magnetic field, a cooling fan is visible below it, and power supply and [[line filter]] surround the coil. In the centre of the coil is a temperature sensor, covered in white [[thermal grease]]]]\n[[File:InductionsStove 3.jpg|thumb|alt=Ventilation slots visible. The unit has a small depth compared to the width of the stove|Side view of an induction stove]]\nAn induction cooker transfers electrical energy by [[Electromagnetic induction|induction]] from a coil of wire into a  metal vessel that must be [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]]. The coil is mounted under the cooking surface, and a high frequency (e.g. 24&nbsp;kHz)  [[alternating current]] is passed through it. The current in the coil creates a dynamic magnetic field. When an [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive]] pot is brought close to the cooking surface, and the pan is thicker than the [[skin depth]], the magnetic field induces large [[eddy current]]s in the pot. The eddy currents flow through the [[electrical resistance]] of the pot to produce heat through [[Joule heating]]; the pot then in turn heats its contents by [[heat conduction]].\n\nThe cooking vessel typically needs to be made of a suitable [[stainless steel]] or [[iron]]. The increased [[magnetic permeability]] of the material decreases the [[skin depth]], concentrating the current near the surface of the metal, and so the electrical resistance will be further increased. Some energy will be dissipated wastefully by the current flowing through the resistance of the coil. To reduce the skin effect and consequent heat generation in the coil, it is made from [[litz wire]], which is a bundle of many smaller insulated wires in parallel. The coil has many turns, while the bottom of the pot effectively forms a single shorted turn. This forms a [[transformer]] that steps down the voltage and steps up the current. The resistance of the pot, as viewed from the primary coil, appears larger. In turn, most of the energy becomes heat in the high-resistance steel, while the driving coil stays cool.\n\nOften a thermostat is present to measure the temperature of the pan. This helps prevent the pan from severely overheating if accidentally heated empty or boiled dry, but also can allow the induction cooker to maintain a target temperature.\n\n===Applications===\n\nInduction equipment may be a built-in surface, part of a range, or a standalone surface unit. Built-in and rangetop units typically have multiple elements, the equivalent of separate burners on a gas-fueled range. Stand-alone induction modules are usually single-element, or sometimes have dual elements. All such elements share a basic design: an electromagnet sealed beneath a heat-resisting [[glass-ceramic]] sheet that is easily cleaned. The pot is placed on the ceramic glass surface and begins to heat up, along with its contents.\n\nIn [[Japan]], some models of [[rice cooker]]s are powered by induction. In Hong Kong, power companies list a number of models. Asian manufacturers have taken the lead in producing inexpensive single-induction-zone surfaces; efficient, low-waste-heat units are advantageous in densely populated cities with little living space per family, as many Asian cities are. Induction cookers are less frequently used in other parts of the world.\n\nInduction ranges may be applicable in commercial restaurant kitchens. Electric cooking avoids the cost of natural gas piping and in some jurisdictions may allow simpler ventilation and fire suppression equipment to be installed.<ref>Roger Fields, ''Restaurant Success by the Numbers: A Money-Guy's Guide to Opening the Next Hot Spot'', Random House of Canada, 2007 {{ISBN|1-58008-663-2}}, pp. 144\u2013145</ref> Drawbacks for commercial use include possible breakages of the glass cook-top, higher initial cost and the requirement for magnetic cookware.\n\n===Controls===\n\nThe [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] properties of a steel vessel concentrate the induced current in a thin layer near its surface, which results in a strong heating effect. In [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic materials]] like aluminum, the magnetic field penetrates deeper, and the induced current encounters little resistance in the metal.<ref>{{cite book|url-status=dead|chapter=A comparative study of resonant inverter topologies used in induction cookers|author1=Llorente, S. |title=APEC.

At least one high-frequency \"all-metal\" cooker is available, that works with lower efficiency on non-ferromagnetic metal cookware.\n\nThe cooking surface is made of a [[glass-ceramic]] material which is a poor heat conductor, so only a little heat is lost through the bottom of the pot. In normal operation the cooking surface stays significantly cooler than with other stove cooking methods, but still needs to cool down before it can be safely touched.\n\nUnits may have one, two, three, four or five induction zones, but four (normally in a 30-inch-wide unit) is the most common in the US and Europe. Two coils are most common in Hong Kong and three are most common in Japan. Some have touch-sensitive controls. Some induction stoves have a memory setting, one per element, to control the time that heat is applied. At least one manufacturer makes a \"zoneless\" induction cooking surface with multiple induction coils. This allows up to five utensils to be used at once anywhere on the cooking surface, not just on pre-defined zones.<ref>[http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf DeDietrich \"Piano\" cooktop specifications, retrieved 2012 May 9] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032647/http://www.dedietrich.co.uk/documents/DTiM1000C_techspecs.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}, dedietrich.co.uk</ref>\n\nSmall stand-alone portable induction cookers are relatively inexpensive, priced from around {{US$|20}} in some markets.\n\n===Cookware===\n\n[[File:Induction-label-de.svg|thumb|Cookware may carry a symbol that identifies it as compatible with an induction cooktop]]\n\nCookware must be compatible with induction heating; in most models, only ferrous metal can be heated. Cookware should have a flat bottom since the magnetic field drops rapidly with distance from the surface. (Special and costly wok-shaped tops are available for use with round-bottom [[wok]]s.) Induction disks are metal plates that are heated by induction and heat non-ferrous pots by thermal contact, but these are much less efficient than ferrous cooking vessels.\n\nInduction compatible cookware for an induction cooking surface can nearly always be used on other stoves. Some cookware or packaging is marked with symbols to indicate compatibility with induction, gas, or electric heat. Induction cooking surfaces work well with any pans with a high ferrous metal content at the base. Cast iron pans and any black metal or iron pans will work on an induction cooking surface. Stainless steel pans will work on an induction cooking surface if the base of the pan is a magnetic grade of stainless steel. If a magnet sticks well to the sole of the pan, it will work on an induction cooking surface. An \"all-metal\" cooker will work with non-ferrous cookware, but available models are limited.\n\nAluminum or copper alone does not work on an induction stove because of the materials\u2019 [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|magnetic]] and [[resistivity|electrical]] properties.<ref name=Moreland73>W. C. Moreland, ''The Induction Range: Its Performance and Its Development Problems'', IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications, vol. TA-9, no. 1, January/February 1973 pages 81\u201386</ref> Aluminum and copper cookware are more conductive than steel, but the [[skin depth]] in these materials is larger since they are non-magnetic. The current flows in a thicker layer in the metal, encounters less resistance and so produces less heat. The induction cooker will not work efficiently with such pots. However, aluminum and copper are desirable in cookware, since they conduct heat better. Because of this 'tri-ply' pans often have an induction-compatible skin of stainless steel containing a layer of thermally conductive aluminum.\n\nFor frying, a pan with a base that is a good heat conductor is needed to spread the heat quickly and evenly. The sole of the pan will be either a steel plate pressed into the aluminum, or a layer of stainless steel over the aluminum. The high thermal conductivity of aluminum pans makes the temperature more uniform across the pan. Stainless frying pans with an aluminum base will not have the same temperature at their sides as an aluminum sided pan will have. Cast iron frying pans work well with induction cooking surfaces but the material is not as good a thermal conductor as aluminum.\n\nWhen boiling water, the circulating water spreads the heat and prevents hot spots. For products such as sauces, it is important that at least the base of the pan incorporates a good heat conducting material to spread the heat evenly. For delicate products such as thick sauces, a pan with aluminum throughout is better, since the heat flows up the sides through the aluminum, allowing the cook to heat the sauce rapidly but evenly.\n\n[[File:Foil on induction cooktop.jpg|thumb|alt=Aluminum foil in a square Pyrex dish of water, with a tear where the foil has melted| Household foil is much thinner than the skin depth in aluminum at the frequencies used by an induction cooker. Here the foil has melted where it was exposed to the air after steam formed under it. Cooking surface manufacturers prohibit the use of aluminum foil in contact with an induction cooking surface]]\n\nThe heat that can be produced in a pot is a function of the surface resistance. A higher surface resistance produces more heat for similar currents. This is a \u201cfigure of merit\u201d that can be used to rank the suitability of a material for induction heating. The surface resistance in a thick metal conductor is proportional to the resistivity divided by the skin depth. Where the thickness is less than the skin depth, the actual thickness can be used to calculate surface resistance.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some common materials are listed in this table.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Skin depth at 24&nbsp;kHz<ref name=Moreland73/>\n!

Since the skin depth is inversely proportional to the square root of the frequency, this suggests that much higher frequencies would be required to obtain equivalent heating in a copper pot as in an iron pot at 24&nbsp;kHz. Such high frequencies are not feasible with inexpensive power semiconductors; in 1973 the [[silicon-controlled rectifier]]s used were limited to no more than 40&nbsp;kHz.<ref name=Moreland73/> Even a thin layer of copper on the bottom of a steel cooking vessel will shield the steel from the magnetic field and make it unusable for an induction top.<ref name=Moreland73/> Some additional heat is created by [[hysteresis loss]]es in the pot due to its ferromagnetic nature, but this creates less than ten percent of the total heat generated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|title=AN9012 Induction Heating System Topology Review|author=Fairchild Semiconductors|date=July 2000|accessdate=2009-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724205258/http://www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-9012.pdf|archive-date=2014-07-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===\"All-metal\" models===\n\nNew types of power semiconductors and low-loss coil designs have made an all-metal cooker possible.\n\nPanasonic Corporation in 2009 developed a consumer induction cooker that uses a higher-frequency magnetic field, and a different oscillator circuit design, to allow use with non-ferrous metals.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Fujita |first=Atsushi |author2=Sadakata, Hideki |author3=Hirota, Izuo |author4=Omori, Hideki |author5=Nakaoka, Mutsuo |title=Latest developments of high-frequency series load resonant inverter type built-in cooktops for induction heated all metallic appliances |conference=Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, 2009.

The induction cooker was shown heating a pot of water with a newspaper placed between the stove and the pot, to demonstrate the convenience and safety. This unit, however, was never put into production.\n\nModern implementation in the USA dates from the early 1970s, with work done at the Research & Development Center of [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] at Churchill Borough, near [[Pittsburgh]],<ref name=Moreland73/> That work was first put on public display at the 1971 [[National Association of Home Builders]] convention in Houston, Texas, as part of the Westinghouse Consumer Products Division display.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The stand-alone single-burner range was named the Cool Top Induction Range. It used paralleled [[Delco Electronics]] transistors developed for automotive electronic ignition systems to drive the 25&nbsp;kHz current.\n\n[[File:Westinghouse CT-2 Induction Range photograph 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The Westinghouse Electric CT-2; the first production induction range from 1973]]\nWestinghouse decided to make a few hundred production units to develop the market. Those were named Cool Top 2 (CT2) Induction ranges. The development work was done at the same R&D location by a team led by Bill Moreland and Terry Malarkey. The ranges were priced at $1,500 ($8,260 in 2017 dollars), including a set of high quality cookware made of Quadraply, a new laminate of stainless steel, carbon steel, aluminum and another layer of stainless steel (outside to inside).\n\nProduction took place in 1973 through to 1975 and stopped, coincidentally, with the sale of Westinghouse Consumer Products Division to [[White Consolidated Industries]] Inc.\n\nCT2 had four \"burners\" of about 1,600 watts each, measured by calorimetry. The range top was a [[Pyroceram]] ceramic sheet surrounded by a stainless-steel bezel, upon which four magnetic sliders adjusted four corresponding [[potentiometer]]s set below. That design, using no through-holes, made the range impervious to spills. The electronics section was made of four identical modules which were cooled by a single quiet, low-speed, high-torque fan.\n\nIn each of the electronics modules, the 240 V, 60&nbsp;Hz domestic line power was converted to between 20 V to 200 V of continuously variable DC by a phase-controlled [[rectifier]]. That DC power was in turn converted to 27&nbsp;kHz 30&nbsp;A (peak) AC by two arrays of six paralleled [[Motorola]] automotive-ignition transistors in a half-bridge configuration driving a series-resonant [[LC circuit|LC]] [[oscillator]], of which the inductor component was the induction-heating coil and its load, the cooking pan. The circuit design, largely by Ray Mackenzie,<ref>{{US Patent|3889090|Induction Heat Cooking Apparatus|Raymond W Mackenzie}}</ref> successfully dealt with certain bothersome overload problems.\n\nControl electronics included functions such as protection against over-heated cook-pans and overloads.

After aggressive promotions by utilities in HK, many local brands emerged. Their power and ratings are high, more than 2,800 watts. Some of these companies have also started marketing in the West. However, the product range sold in Western markets is a subset of that in their domestic market; some Japanese electronics manufacturers only sell domestically.\n\nIn the United States, as of early 2013 there are over five dozen brands of induction-cooking equipment available, including both built-in and countertop residential equipment and commercial-grade equipment.  Even restricting to build-in residential-use units, there are over two dozen brands being sold; residential countertop units add another two-dozen-plus brands to the count.\n\nThe National Association of Home Builders in 2012 estimated that, in the United States, induction cooktops held only 4% of sales, compared to gas and other electric cooktops.<ref>[http://www.nahb.org/generic.aspx?genericContentID=183725&fromGSA=1 ''Kitchen Appliance Upgrades that Shine'', retrieved 2012 Aug 15], nahb.org{{dead link|date=August 2015}}</ref> The global induction cooktops market was estimated at $9.16 ml in value during 2015 and is set to grow to $13.53 mil by 2022.\n\nIn April 2010, ''The New York Times'' reported that \"In an independent survey last summer by the market research company Mintel of 2,000 Internet users who own appliances, only 5 percent of respondents said they had an induction range or cooktop. . . .

Beach resorts and hotels have been developed in some popular tourist destinations, especially Bali island as the primary destination. At the same time, the integration of cultural affairs and tourism under the scope of the same ministry shows that cultural tourism is considered an integral part of Indonesia's tourism industry, and conversely, that tourism is used to promote and preserve the cultural heritage.\n\nSome of the challenges Indonesia's tourism industry has to face include the development of infrastructure to support tourism across the sprawling archipelago, incursions of the industry into local traditions ([[adat]]), and the impact of tourism development on the life of local people.

Since 2002, warnings have been issued by some countries over terrorist threats and ethnic as well as religious conflicts in some areas, significantly reducing the number of foreign visitors for a few years.

Indonesia is also the host of PATA Travel Mart in 1985 and 1989 in Bali, and 2016 in Jakarta.\n\nIn the early-to-mid-1970s, high standard hotels and tourist facilities began to appear in Jakarta and Bali. After the completion of [[Borobudur]] restoration project in 1982, [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]] become a popular tourist destination in Indonesia after Bali, mostly attracted to this 8th-century Buddhist monument, surrounding ancient Javanese temples and [[Yogyakarta Sultanate]] [[Kraton (Indonesia)|palace]]. From this period to the end of the [[Suharto]] era, governmental policies of the [[tourism industry]] included an array of regulations and developments to encourage increasing numbers of international tourists to both visit Indonesia and stay longer.\n\n== Nature tourism ==\n{{Main|Fauna of Indonesia|Flora of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Ngaraisianok.jpg|thumb|right|Sianok canyon in [[Bukittinggi]], [[West Sumatra]]]]\n\nIndonesia has a well-preserved, natural ecosystem with [[rainforests]] that stretch over about 57% of Indonesia's land ({{convert|225|e6acre|km2|order=flip|abbr=off|disp=or}}), approximately 2% of which are [[mangrove]] systems.<ref name=\"WWF\">{{Cite web|publisher=WWF UK|url=http://www.wwf.org.uk/researcher/places/0000000216.asp|title=Indonesia|accessdate=17 September 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925205819/http://www.wwf.org.uk/researcher/places/0000000216.asp|archivedate=25 September 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Indonesia|publisher=Rainforest Action Network|url=http://www.rainforestweb.org/Rainforest_Regions/Asia/Indonesia/|accessdate=17 September 2006 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060908104002/http://www.rainforestweb.org/Rainforest_Regions/Asia/Indonesia/ |archivedate = 8 September 2006}}</ref> One reason why the [[Ecosystem|natural ecosystem]] in Indonesia is still well-preserved is because only 6,000 [[islands]] out of 17,000 are permanently inhabited.<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=Embassy of Indonesia (KBRI) at Canberra|title=Indonesia Claims a Permanent Seat on the Security Council|url=http://www.kbri-canberra.org.au/press/press040927e_deplu.htm|date=27 September 2004}}</ref> Forests on [[Sumatra]] and [[Java]] are examples of popular tourist destinations.

Although Indonesia has many world-class surfing spots, the majority of surfers come from abroad, especially Australia and United States. However, enthusiasm for local surfing began in Bali and West Java's [[Pelabuhan Ratu]] and [[Pangandaran]] beach, with most surfers arriving from nearby cities of Jakarta and Bandung.\n\nIn 2018, [[World Surf League]] has had 8 surfing events in Indonesia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2018/11/21/tourism-ministry-to-hold-11-surfing-competitions-in-2019.html |title=Tourism Ministry to hold 11 surfing competitions in 2019 |date=November 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn Bali, there are about 33 surf locations, from West Bali to East Bali including four on the offshore island of [[Nusa Lembongan]].

High season for surfing is around May to September with the trade winds blowing from east to south-east. From October to April, winds tend to come from the west to north-west, so the east coast breaks get the offshore winds.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nTwo well-known surf breaks in Indonesia are the [[G-Land]] in the Bay of Grajagan, [[East Java]], and [[Lagundri Bay]] at the southern end of [[Nias]] island. G-Land was first identified in 1972, when a surfer saw the break from the window of a plane. Since 6 to 8-foot ([[Hawaiian scale]]) waves were discovered by surfers at Lagundri Bay in 1975, the island has become famous for surfing worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\n=== National parks ===\n{{Main|List of national parks of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Komodo dragon at Komodo National Park Indonesia.jpg|thumb|[[Komodo dragon]] at [[Komodo National Park]]]]\n[[Bogor Botanical Gardens]] established in 1817, and [[Cibodas Botanical Gardens]] established in 1862, are two among the oldest botanical gardens in Asia.

Other national parks on the list are [[Lorentz National Park]] in [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]], [[Komodo National Park]] in the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], and [[Ujung Kulon National Park]] in the west of [[Java]].\n\nTo be noticed, different national parks offer different biodiversity, as the natural habitat in Indonesia is divided into two areas by the [[Wallace line]]. The [[Wallacea]] [[biogeographical]] distinction means the western part of Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan) have the same flora and fauna characteristics as the Asian continent, whilst the remaining eastern part of Indonesia has similarity with the Australian continent.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" />\n\nMany native species such as [[Sumatran elephant]]s, [[Sumatran tiger]]s, [[Sumatran rhinoceros]], [[Javan rhinoceros]] and [[orangutans]] are listed as [[endangered species|endangered]] or [[critically endangered]], and the remaining populations are found in [[List of national parks of Indonesia|national parks]] and other conservation areas. [[Sumatran orangutan]] can be visited in the [[Bukit Lawang]] conservation area, while the [[Bornean orangutan]] can be visited in [[Tanjung Puting]] national park, Central Kalimantan.

Along the Indonesian classical history of Hindu-Buddhist era, they produced some temples and monuments called ''candi''. The best-preserved Buddhist shrine, which was built during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty in the 8th century, is [[Borobudur]] temple in [[Central Java]]. A giant stone [[mandala]] stepped pyramid adorned with bell-shaped [[stupa]]s, richly adorned with bas-reliefs telling the stories and teachings of Buddha.\n[[File:Candi Sewu viewed from the south, 23 November 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Sewu]] Mahayana Buddhist temple near Prambanan, Central Java]]\nA few kilometers to the southeast is the [[Prambanan]] complex, the largest Hindu temple in Indonesia built during the second [[Mataram Kingdom|Mataram]] dynasty.<ref name=\"nytimes1\" /> The Prambanan temple is dedicated to [[Trimurti]]; [[Shiva]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Brahma]], three highest gods in Hinduism.

The tourism industry in Indonesia has also faced setbacks due to problems related to security. Since 2002, warnings have been issued by some countries over terrorist threats and ethnic as well as religious conflicts in some areas, significantly reducing the number of foreign visitors for a few years.

The biggest movement of domestic tourists is during the annual [[Eid ul-Fitr]], locally known as ''[[lebaran]]''. During this period, which is a two-week holiday after the month of [[fasting during Ramadan]], many city-dwelling [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim Indonesians]] visit relatives in their home towns. Intercity traffic is at its peak and often an additional surcharge is applied during this time.\n\nOver the five years up to 2006, attention has been focused on generating more domestic tourism. Competition amongst [[budget airlines]] has increased the number of domestic air travellers throughout the country. Recently, the Ministry of Labour legislated to create long weekends by combining [[Public holidays in Indonesia|public holidays]] that fall close to weekends, except in the case of important religious holidays.

The 15th-century travelogue of [[Bujangga Manik]], a travelling Hindu scholar-priest from [[Pakuan Pajajaran]], reported about his travel around Java and Bali.

[[Naxos Records]] released two volumes of J.S.Bach\u2019s English Suites, transcribed by the duo for two guitars in 2015 (Suites 1-3) and 2018 (Suites 4-6). \n\nGoran Krivokapic\u2019s musical focus lies on the development of new works for classical guitar, mainly through making his own transcriptions of baroque and classical works, and collaborating with contemporary composers. Gerard Drozd dedicated his Concierto de Gliwice Opus 175, which Krivokapi\u0107 premiered with the AUKSO Chamber Orchestra in 2018, conducted by Marek Mo\u015b. Drozd\u2019s Concierto for two guitars and string quartett Opus 140, dedicated to the Montenegrin Guitar Duo was premiered by Krivokapi\u0107 and Cerovi\u0107, together with the Camerata Quartett in 2013, as well as his Suite for two guitars Opus 150, dedicated to the Montenegrin Guitar Duo and premiered by them in 2014. In 2011 Drozd wrote a piece \u201cFavola per Luka\u201d to commemorate the birth of Krivokapic\u2019s son. The premiere recording of [[Hendrik Hofmeyr]]\u2019s Rapsodia Notturna per chitarra e pianoforte, written for Krivokapi\u0107 and Corneli Smit, and Sonate Printani\u00e8re by [[Du\u0161an Bogdanovi\u0107]] for guitar and piano was released in 2013 together with other original chamber music works for guitar and piano by KSGEXAUDIO. He premiered Hofmeyr\u2019s Lachrymae for guitar, which was written for him, during the Meesters op de Gitaar series at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam in 2009. Hofmeyr wrote Diablerie for viola and guitar for Krivokapi\u0107 and Gareth Lubbe, which they premiered in 2019 at Krivokapi\u0107\u2019s inaugural concert at the Cologne University of Music (Wuppertal).
