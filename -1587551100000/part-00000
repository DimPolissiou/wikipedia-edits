The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name=\"Zelensky bowed until luck\" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].\n\nThe inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13\u20139 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23\u201317 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a mostly party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).\n\nThe articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office.

The inquiry reported that Trump withheld military aid{{efn|Intended to help Ukraine in its [[War in Donbass|war against Russian-backed separatist forces in Donbass]]<ref name=\"Zelensky bowed until luck\" />}} and an invitation to the White House to [[Ukrainian president]] [[Volodymyr Zelensky]] in order [[Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal|to influence Ukraine]] to announce an investigation into one of Trump's political opponents, [[Joe Biden]], and to promote [[Conspiracy theories related to the Trump\u2013Ukraine scandal#CrowdStrike|a discredited conspiracy theory]] that Ukraine, not Russia, was behind [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|interference in the 2016 presidential election]].\n\nThe inquiry stage of Trump's impeachment lasted from September to November 2019, in the wake of an [[Impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump#Withholding of military aid and July 25 phone call|August 2019 whistleblower complaint]] alleging Trump's abuse of power. In October, three congressional committees ([[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform|Oversight]], and [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|Foreign Affairs]]) deposed witnesses. In November, the [[House Intelligence Committee]] held a number of public hearings in which witnesses testified publicly; on December 3, the committee voted 13\u20139 along party lines to adopt a final report. A set of impeachment hearings before the [[House Judiciary Committee]] began on December 4; on December 13, it voted 23\u201317 along party lines to recommend two articles of impeachment, for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The committee released a lengthy report on the impeachment articles on December 16. Two days later, the full House approved both articles in a mostly party-line vote, with all Republicans opposing along with three Democrats. This made Trump the third U.S. president in history to be impeached and marked the first fully partisan impeachment where a U.S. president was impeached without support from the President's own party (though [[independent politician|independent]] representative [[Justin Amash]], who voted in favor of impeachment on both articles, had previously been a Republican until July 2019).\n\nThe articles were submitted to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on January 16, 2020, initiating [[Impeachment trial of Donald Trump|the trial]]. The trial saw no witnesses or documents being subpoenaed, as Republican senators rejected attempts to introduce subpoenas on January 21 while arranging for trial procedures, and then on January 31 after a debate. On February 5, Trump was acquitted on both counts by the Senate as neither count received 67 votes to convict. On Article I, abuse of power, 48 senators voted for conviction, while 52 senators voted for acquittal. On Article II, obstruction of Congress, 47 senators voted for conviction, while 53 senators voted to acquit. Republican [[Mitt Romney]], the only senator to break party lines, became the first U.S senator to vote to convict a president of his own party in an impeachment trial, as he voted for conviction on abuse of power.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/02/05/no-senator-ever-voted-remove-president-his-party-office-until-mitt-romney/|title=No senator ever voted to remove a president of his own party from office.
