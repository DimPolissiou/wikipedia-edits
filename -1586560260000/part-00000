It was founded on 19 April 1973 in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]], by militants from the Portuguese Socialist Action ({{lang-pt|Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Socialista Portuguesa}}). The PS is one of the two [[Major party|major parties]] in Portuguese politics, its rival being the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD). The current leader of the PS is [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]. The party has currently 108 of 230 seats in the Portuguese Parliament following the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 election]], forming a minority government.\n\nPS is a member of the [[Socialist International]], [[Progressive Alliance]] and [[Party of European Socialists]], and has nine members in the [[European Parliament]] within the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists & Democrats]] (S&D) Group during the [[9th European Parliament|ninth parliament]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ant\u00f3nio Costa img 6536.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]] since November 2015 and Secretary-General since 2014.]]\n{{Social democracy sidebar}}\nThe Socialist Party (PS) was created at a conference of Portuguese Socialist Action (ASP), at that time in exile, on 19 April 1973, in [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]] in [[West Germany]]. The twenty-seven delegates decided to found a party of [[socialism]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]], making an explicit reference to a [[classless society]] and without [[Marxism]], redesigned as a source of principal inspiration.\n\nOn 25 April 1974, the [[Carnation Revolution]] brought down the authoritarian regime of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], established in 1933, and democracy was restored. The general secretary of the PS, M\u00e1rio Soares, returned to Portugal after being in exile in France, and became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Portugal)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] was appointed Minister of Interjurisdictional Coordination in one of the first provisional governments.\n\nAfter the Revolution, elections were called for 25 April 1975 and the Socialist Party (PS) won the [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|1975 election for the Constituent Assembly]] and the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|1976 elections for the National Assembly]], then losing to the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] (AD) in the [[1979 Portuguese legislative election|1979 legislative election]].\n\nIn 1980, the PS made an electoral alliance called the [[Republican and Socialist Front]] (FRS), between the Independent Social Democrats (ASDI), led by Sousa Franco, and the [[Leftwing Union for the Socialist Democracy]] (UEDS), led by Lopes Cardoso. The alliance failed to defeat the AD.\n\nThey won the 1983 general election, but without an [[absolute majority]], the Socialists formed a [[grand coalition]] with the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), creating a \"[[Central Block]]\". The new government began negotiations for Portugal to enter the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). In 1985 the Central Block broke down and the PS at the time led by [[Almeida Santos]], lost the [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|1985 legislative election]]. Cavaco Silva's PSD won the 1985 elections and again in 1987 and 1991 with absolute majority. The PS was in opposition for more than ten years.\n\nIn 1995, the Socialist Party, then led by [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]], won a general election for the first time in twelve years, and in 1999, they failed to obtain what would have been an historic [[absolute majority]] for the party by only one MP. In 2001, after a massive defeat in the 2001 local elections, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres resigned as Prime Minister and called for new elections in 2002. The Socialist Party lost the [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002 general election]] by a small margin to the PSD, who formed a coalition government with the [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|People's Party]] (CDS\u2013PP).\n\nIn June 2004, the PS won the [[2004 European Parliament election in Portugal|2004 European elections]] by a landslide, and a few weeks later, [[Dur\u00e3o Barroso]], leader of the PSD and Prime Minister, resigned to become President of the European Commission. In December 2004, [[Jorge Sampaio]], President of the Republic, called fresh [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|elections for February 2005]]. These elections resulted in a landslide victory for the PS, winning for the first time since its foundation an absolute majority. [[Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates]], leader of the PS, became Prime Minister.\n\nIn 2009, after four-and-a-half years in power, the PS lost the [[2009 European Parliament election in Portugal|European Parliament elections]] to the PSD. However, they won the [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|general election]] held on 27 September but failed to renew the absolute majority they won in the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|2005 election]]. The PS later introduced and legislated [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|same-sex marriage]].\n\nThe [[Eurozone crisis|financial crisis of 2011]] hit Portugal very hard, prompting S\u00f3crates' government to impose harsh [[austerity|austerity measures]]. On 23 March 2011, the entire opposition in Parliament said no to new measures proposed by the government. As a result of this, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates resigned as Prime Minister and a [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|snap election took place on 5 June 2011]].\n\nIn the elections, the PS suffered a huge setback, with 28.1% of the vote, ten points behind the PSD, who formed another coalition government with the CDS-PP. S\u00f3crates resigned as General Secretary on election night after the PS's worst result since 1987. On 23 July 2011, [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro]] was elected as S\u00f3crates' successor.\n\nThe PS, under the leadership of Seguro, won the [[2013 Portuguese local elections|2013 local elections]] making significant gains over the PSD and the Socialists again won the [[2014 European Parliament election in Portugal|European elections on May 2014]] but this time only just. They won 31.5% of the vote against the almost 28% of the alliance between the PSD and CDS-PP. The result was considered quite a disappointment to many Socialist party members and supporters and on May 27 [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the then mayor of Lisbon, announced that he would stand for the leadership of the Socialist Party.<ref name=\"leadership\">{{cite news |title=Ant\u00f3nio Costa avan\u00e7a para a lideran\u00e7a do PS |first1=S\u00e1 Louren\u00e7o |last1=Nuno |newspaper=[[P\u00fablico (Portugal)|P\u00fablico]] |date=27 May 2014 |url=http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/antonio-costa-avanca-para-a-lideranca-do-ps-1637636 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro refused to call a new congress and leadership election and instead called for a [[Portuguese Socialist Party prime ministerial primary, 2014|primary election]], to be held on 28 September, to elect the party's candidate for Prime Minister in the 2015 general elections.<ref name=\"primary\">{{cite news |title=Aprovada a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de elei\u00e7\u00f5es prim\u00e1rias no PS a 28 de setembro |first1=Roque |last1=Telma |newspaper=[[Jornal de Not\u00edcias]] |date=6 June 2014 |url=http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Politica/Interior.aspx?content_id=3957251 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Costa easily defeated Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro in the primaries by a 67% to 31% margin.\n\nIn the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 legislative elections]], the PS polled a disappointing second place, capturing just 32% of the votes against the 38.6% of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition called [[Portugal Ahead]]. Despite the victory of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition, the centre-left and left-wing parties achieved a clear majority in Parliament. After the second Passos Coelho cabinet fell in Parliament, with the approval of a no-confidence motion, the PS forged an agreement with [[Left Bloc|BE]] and [[Unitary Democratic Coalition|CDU]] to support a PS minority government. For the first time in Portuguese democracy, the leader of the second most voted political force became [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]].\n\nCosta led a very successful first term as Prime Minister with a growing economy, low unemployment and deficit cuts. In the [[2019 European Parliament election in Portugal|2019 May EP elections]], the PS won a landslide by achieving 33.4%, against the 22% of the PSD. The PS also won the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 general election]] with 36% of the votes, against the 28% of the PSD, but by a closer margin than expected.

It was founded on 19 April 1973 in the [[Germany|German]] city of [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]], by militants from the Portuguese Socialist Action ({{lang-pt|Ac\u00e7\u00e3o Socialista Portuguesa}}). The PS is one of the two [[Major party|major parties]] in Portuguese politics, its rival being the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD). The current leader of the PS is [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the [[Prime Minister of Portugal]]. The party has currently 108 of 230 seats in the Portuguese Parliament following the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 election]], forming a minority government.\n\nPS is a member of the [[Socialist International]], [[Progressive Alliance]] and [[Party of European Socialists]], and has nine members in the [[European Parliament]] within the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats|Socialists & Democrats]] (S&D) Group during the [[9th European Parliament|ninth parliament]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ant\u00f3nio Costa img 6536.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]] since November 2015 and Secretary-General since 2014.]]\n{{Social democracy sidebar}}\nThe Socialist Party (PS) was created at a conference of Portuguese Socialist Action (ASP), at that time in exile, on 19 April 1973, in [[Bad M\u00fcnstereifel]] in [[West Germany]]. The twenty-seven delegates decided to found a party of [[socialism]] and [[Political freedom|freedom]], making an explicit reference to a [[classless society]] and without [[Marxism]], redesigned as a source of principal inspiration.\n\nOn 25 April 1974, the [[Carnation Revolution]] brought down the authoritarian regime of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]], established in 1933, and democracy was restored. The general secretary of the PS, M\u00e1rio Soares, returned to Portugal after being in exile in France, and became [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Portugal)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] was appointed Minister of Interjurisdictional Coordination in one of the first provisional governments.\n\nAfter the Revolution, elections were called for 25 April 1975 and the Socialist Party (PS) won the [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|1975 election for the Constituent Assembly]] and the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|1976 elections for the National Assembly]], then losing to the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] (AD) in the [[1979 Portuguese legislative election|1979 legislative election]].\n\nIn 1980, the PS made an electoral alliance called the [[Republican and Socialist Front]] (FRS), between the Independent Social Democrats (ASDI), led by Sousa Franco, and the [[Leftwing Union for the Socialist Democracy]] (UEDS), led by Lopes Cardoso. The alliance failed to defeat the AD.\n\nThey won the 1983 general election, but without an [[absolute majority]], the Socialists formed a [[grand coalition]] with the centre-right [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]] (PSD), creating a \"[[Central Block]]\". The new government began negotiations for Portugal to enter the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC). In 1985 the Central Block broke down and the PS at the time led by [[Almeida Santos]], lost the [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|1985 legislative election]]. Cavaco Silva's PSD won the 1985 elections and again in 1987 and 1991 with absolute majority. The PS was in opposition for more than ten years.\n\nIn 1995, the Socialist Party, then led by [[Ant\u00f3nio Guterres]], won a general election for the first time in twelve years, and in 1999, they failed to obtain what would have been an historic [[absolute majority]] for the party by only one MP. In 2001, after a massive defeat in the 2001 local elections, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres resigned as Prime Minister and called for new elections in 2002. The Socialist Party lost the [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002 general election]] by a small margin to the PSD, who formed a coalition government with the [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|People's Party]] (CDS\u2013PP).\n\nIn June 2004, the PS won the [[2004 European Parliament election in Portugal|2004 European elections]] by a landslide, and a few weeks later, [[Dur\u00e3o Barroso]], leader of the PSD and Prime Minister, resigned to become President of the European Commission. In December 2004, [[Jorge Sampaio]], President of the Republic, called fresh [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|elections for February 2005]]. These elections resulted in a landslide victory for the PS, winning for the first time since its foundation an absolute majority. [[Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates]], leader of the PS, became Prime Minister.\n\nIn 2009, after four-and-a-half years in power, the PS lost the [[2009 European Parliament election in Portugal|European Parliament elections]] to the PSD. However, they won the [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|general election]] held on 27 September but failed to renew the absolute majority they won in the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|2005 election]]. The PS later introduced and legislated [[Same-sex marriage in Portugal|same-sex marriage]].\n\nThe [[Eurozone crisis|financial crisis of 2011]] hit Portugal very hard, prompting S\u00f3crates' government to impose harsh [[austerity|austerity measures]]. On 23 March 2011, the entire opposition in Parliament said no to new measures proposed by the government. As a result of this, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates resigned as Prime Minister and a [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|snap election took place on 5 June 2011]].\n\nIn the elections, the PS suffered a huge setback, with 28.1% of the vote, ten points behind the PSD, who formed another coalition government with the CDS-PP. S\u00f3crates resigned as General Secretary on election night after the PS's worst result since 1987. On 23 July 2011, [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro]] was elected as S\u00f3crates' successor.\n\nThe PS, under the leadership of Seguro, won the [[2013 Portuguese local elections|2013 local elections]] making significant gains over the PSD and the Socialists again won the [[2014 European Parliament election in Portugal|European elections on May 2014]] but this time only just. They won 31.5% of the vote against the almost 28% of the alliance between the PSD and CDS-PP. The result was considered quite a disappointment to many Socialist party members and supporters and on May 27 [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]], the then mayor of Lisbon, announced that he would stand for the leadership of the Socialist Party.<ref name=\"leadership\">{{cite news |title=Ant\u00f3nio Costa avan\u00e7a para a lideran\u00e7a do PS |first1=S\u00e1 Louren\u00e7o |last1=Nuno |newspaper=[[P\u00fablico (Portugal)|P\u00fablico]] |date=27 May 2014 |url=http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/antonio-costa-avanca-para-a-lideranca-do-ps-1637636 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro refused to call a new congress and leadership election and instead called for a [[Portuguese Socialist Party prime ministerial primary, 2014|primary election]], to be held on 28 September, to elect the party's candidate for Prime Minister in the 2015 general elections.<ref name=\"primary\">{{cite news |title=Aprovada a realiza\u00e7\u00e3o de elei\u00e7\u00f5es prim\u00e1rias no PS a 28 de setembro |first1=Roque |last1=Telma |newspaper=[[Jornal de Not\u00edcias]] |date=6 June 2014 |url=http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Politica/Interior.aspx?content_id=3957251 |accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> Ant\u00f3nio Costa easily defeated Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro in the primaries by a 67% to 31% margin.\n\nIn the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 legislative elections]], the PS polled a disappointing second place, capturing just 32% of the votes against the 38.6% of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition called [[Portugal Ahead]]. Despite the victory of the PSD/CDS-PP coalition, the centre-left and left-wing parties achieved a clear majority in Parliament. After the second Passos Coelho cabinet fell in Parliament, with the approval of a no-confidence motion, the PS forged an agreement with [[Left Bloc|BE]] and [[Unitary Democratic Coalition|CDU]] to support a PS minority government. For the first time in Portuguese democracy, the leader of the second most voted political force became [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]].\n\nCosta led a very successful first term as Prime Minister with a growing economy, low unemployment and deficit cuts. In the [[2019 European Parliament election in Portugal|2019 May EP elections]], the PS won a landslide by achieving 33.4%, against the 22% of the PSD. The PS also won the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 general election]] with 36% of the votes, against the 28% of the PSD, but by a closer margin than expected. Costa 2nd cabinet was sworn in on 26 October 2019.\n\n==Election results==\n\n===Assembly of the Republic===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; line-height:16px;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"50px\"| Election\n! colspan=\"5\"| [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"170px\"| Government\n! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40px\"| Size\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Leader\n|-\n! width=\"85px\"| Votes\n! width=\"50px\"| %\n! width=\"40px\"| \u00b1[[Percentage point|pp]]\n! width=\"100px\"| Seats won\n! width=\"40px\"| +/\u2212\n|-\n!

The Raja of Jammu [[Gulab Singh]], who was a vassal of the [[Sikh Empire]] and an influential noble in the Sikh court, sent expeditions to various border kingdoms and ended up encircling Kashmir by 1840.  Following the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] (1845{{ndash}}1846), Kashmir was ceded under the [[Treaty of Lahore]] to the [[East India Company]], which transferred it to Gulab Singh through the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]], in return for the payment of indemnity owed by the Sikh empire. Gulab Singh took the title of the [[Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]. From then until the 1947 [[partition of India]], Kashmir was ruled by the Maharajas of the [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Kashmir and Jammu]].

Faced with the Maharaja's indecision on accession, the Muslim League agents clandestinely worked in [[Poonch jagir|Poonch]] to encourage the [[1947 Poonch Rebellion|local Muslims to an armed revolt]], exploiting an internal unrest regarding economic grievances. The authorities in [[Punjab, Pakistan|Pakistani Punjab]] waged a 'private war' by obstructing supplies of fuel and essential commodities to the State.

The Maharaja himself was implicated in some instances. A large number of Muslims were killed. Others fled to West Pakistan, some of whom made their way to the western districts of Poonch and Mirpur, which were [[1947 Poonch Rebellion|undergoing rebellion]].

The deadlock was broken in a personal meeting between the Prime Ministers [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and [[Indira Gandhi]], where Bhutto acknowledged that the Kashmir issue should be finally resolved and removed as a hurdle in India-Pakistan relations; that the cease-fire line, to be renamed the [[Line of Control]], could be gradually converted into a ''de jure'' border between India and Pakistan; and that he would take steps to integrate the Pakistani-controlled portions of Jammu and Kashmir into the federal territories of Pakistan.{{sfn|Dixit, India-Pakistan in War and Peace|2003|pp=228\u2013229}} However, he requested that the formal declaration of the Agreement should not include a final settlement of the Kashmir dispute as it would endanger his fledgling civilian government and bring in military and other hardline elements into power in Pakistan.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dixit, India-Pakistan in War and Peace|2003|pp=228\u2013229}}; {{harvtxt|Haqqani, Pakistan Between Mosque and Military|2010|pp=98\u201399}}; {{harvtxt|Subramaniam, India's Wars|2016|loc=Chapter 27}}; {{harvtxt|Ganguly, Crisis in Kashmir|1999|pp=60\u201363}}</ref>\n\nAccordingly, the [[Simla Agreement]] was formulated and signed by the two countries, whereby the countries resolved to settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations and to maintain the sanctity of the Line of Control.

The [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], which lies strategically in the north-west of the subcontinent bordering Afghanistan and China, was formerly ruled by Maharaja [[Hari Singh]] under the [[paramountcy]] of [[British Raj|British India]]. In geographical and legal terms, the Maharaja could have joined either of the two new countries. Although urged by the Viceroy, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]], to determine the future of his state before the transfer of power took place, Singh demurred. In October 1947, incursions by Pakistan took place leading to a [[1947 war|war]], as a result of which the state of Jammu and Kashmir remains divided between India and Pakistan.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The latter includes a narrow strip of land called [[Azad Kashmir]] and the Northern Areas, comprising the [[Gilgit Agency]], [[Baltistan]], and the former kingdoms of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]]. Attempts to resolve the dispute through political discussions have been unsuccessful. In September 1965, [[1965 war|war]] again broke out between Pakistan and India. The United Nations called for another cease-fire, and peace was restored following the [[Tashkent Declaration]] in 1966, by which both nations returned to their original positions along the demarcated line. After the [[Indo-Pak War of 1971|1971 war]] and the creation of independent [[Bangladesh]] under the terms of the 1972 [[Simla Agreement]] between Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] of India and [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] of Pakistan, it was agreed that neither country would seek to alter the cease-fire line in Kashmir, which was renamed as the Line of Control, \"unilaterally, irrespective of mutual differences and legal interpretations\".\n\nNumerous violations of the Line of Control have occurred, including incursions by insurgents and Pakistani armed forces at Kargil leading to the [[Kargil war]]. There have also been sporadic clashes on the [[Siachen Glacier]], where the Line of Control is not demarcated and both countries maintain forces at altitudes rising to {{convert|20000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, with the Indian forces serving at higher altitudes.\n\n===Indian view===\n[[File:Maharaja of Kashmir, Hari Singh (1895 - 1961).jpg|thumb|[[Maharaja Hari Singh]] signed the [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]] in October 1947 under which he acceded the [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|State of Jammu and Kashmir]] to the Union of India.]]\nIndia has officially stated that it believes Kashmir to be an integral part of India, though the then Prime Minister of India, [[Manmohan Singh]], stated after the [[2010 Kashmir Unrest]] that his government was willing to grant autonomy to the region within the purview of Indian constitution if there was consensus among political parties on this issue.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/latest-news/bjp-challenges-pm-on-kashmir-autonomy-issue/ |title=PM MMS on Kashmir autonomy issue |last= |first= |date= |newspaper=|access-date= |work= |via=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-11/india/28297162_1_autonomy-jammu-and-kashmir-bjp-questions | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712071508/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-11/india/28297162_1_autonomy-jammu-and-kashmir-bjp-questions | url-status=dead | archive-date=12 July 2012 |work=The Times of India |title=BJP questions PM's Kashmir autonomy remark |date=11 August 2010}}</ref> The Indian viewpoint is succinctly summarised by [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)|Ministry of External affairs]], Government of India<ref name=meaindweb>{{cite web |url=http://meaindia.nic.in/jk/kashmirissue.htm |title=Ministry of External Affairs, India&nbsp;\u2013 Kashmir Issue |publisher=Meaindia.nic.in |accessdate=2 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616161619/http://meaindia.nic.in/jk/kashmirissue.htm |archivedate=16 June 2008}}</ref><ref name=meaindpdf>{{cite web |url=http://meaindia.nic.in/jk/19jk01.pdf |title=Kashmir: The true story, Ministry of External Affairs, India |accessdate=2 February 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106084737/http://meaindia.nic.in/jk/19jk01.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2007}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2014\n* India holds that the [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|Instrument of Accession]] of the State of Jammu and Kashmir to the [[Union of India]], signed by Maharaja Hari Singh (erstwhile ruler of the State) on 25 October 1947<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/freedom/0710jha2.htm |title=Excerpted from Kashmir 1947, Rival Versions of History, by Prem Shankar Jha, Oxford University Press, 1996 \u2013 An interview of Sam Manekshaw, the first field marshal in the Indian army, then chosen to accompany V P Menon on his historic mission to Kashmir. |accessdate=19 May 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Chief Justice JSAnand\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rediff.com/news/1999/jun/01jk.htm|title=Rediff On The NeT Special: The Real Kashmir Story|website=www.rediff.com}}</ref> and executed on 27 October 1947<ref name=\"Chief Justice JSAnand\"/> between the ruler of Kashmir and the Governor General of India was a legal act and completely valid in terms of the Government of India Act (1935), Indian Independence Act (1947) as well as under international law and as such was total and irrevocable.<ref name=meaindpdf/>\n* The [[Constituent assembly of Jammu and Kashmir]] had unanimously ratified the Maharaja's Instrument of Accession to India and adopted a constitution for the state that called for a perpetual merger of Jammu and Kashmir with the Union of India.

According to Bose, the Kashmiri Muslims had higher expectations from India which turned out to be a \"moderately successful\" democracy and it was in this context that Kashmiri Muslim rage spilled over after the rigging of the elections in 1987.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ACMe9WBdNAC |title=Kashmir: ROOTS OF CONFLICT, PATHS TO PEACE |last=Bose |first=Sumantra |isbn= 9780674028555|location= |pages=99\u2013100|date=June 2009 }}</ref> The residents of Azad Kashmir are also mostly Punjabi, differing in ethnicity from Kashmiris in the Indian administered section of the state.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEqRAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA153#v=onepage |title=The Territorial Management of Ethnic Conflict |date=2 August 2004 |publisher=Routledge |pages=153 |last1=Coakley |first1=John|isbn=9781135764425 }}</ref>\n\n====Gilgit-Baltistan====\nThe main demand of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is constitutional status for the region as a fifth province of Pakistan.<ref name = indian_express>{{cite web |author=Nadeem |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gilgitbaltistan-a-question-of-autonomy/519428/1 |title=Gilgit-Baltistan: A question of autonomy |date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref name = gilgit_polls /> However, Pakistan claims that Gilgit-Baltistan cannot be given constitutional status due to Pakistan's commitment to the 1948 UN resolution.<ref name=gilgit_polls>{{cite news |last=Shigri |first=Manzar |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AB1ZE20091112 |title=Pakistan's disputed Northern Areas go to polls |agency=Reuters |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=dawn_gilgit>{{cite web |url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |title=DAWN: Gilgit-Baltistan autonomy |work=Dawn |location=Pakistan |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601035500/http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |archivedate=1 June 2012|date=9 September 2009 }}</ref> In 2007, the [[International Crisis Group]] stated that \"Almost six decades after Pakistan's independence, the constitutional status of the Federally Administered Northern Areas (Gilgit and Baltistan), once part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and now under Pakistani control, remains undetermined, with political autonomy a distant dream.

Unofficially, the Pakistani leadership has indicated that they would be willing to accept alternatives such as a demilitarised Kashmir, if sovereignty of Azad Kashmir was to be extended over the Kashmir valley, or the \"Chenab\" formula, by which India would retain parts of Kashmir on its side of the Chenab river, and Pakistan the other side{{mdash}}effectively re-partitioning Kashmir on communal lines. The problem with the proposal is that the population of the Pakistan-administered portion of Kashmir is for the most part ethnically, linguistically, and culturally different from the [[Valley of Kashmir]], a part of Indian-administered Kashmir. Partition based on the Chenab formula is opposed by some Kashmiri politicians, although others, including [[Sajjad Lone]], have suggested that the non-Muslim part of Jammu and Kashmir be separated from Kashmir and handed to India. Some political analysts say that the Pakistan state policy shift and mellowing of its aggressive stance may have to do with its total failure in the [[Kargil War]] and the subsequent [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks.

Since the Constituent Assembly did not make such a recommendation before its dissolution in 1957, the Article 370 has taken on the features of a \"permanent provision\" despite being titled a temporary provision in the Constitution.<ref>[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/j-k-high-court-says-article-370-is-permanent-cant-be-abrogated-repealed-or-amended/ Art 370 permanent\u2026cannot be repealed or amended: HC], The Indian Express, 12 October 2015.</ref><ref>[http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-importance-of-article-370/article7762192.ece The importance of Article 370], The Hindu, 15 October 2015.</ref>\n* [[Article 370]] has emerged as the biggest obstacle in front of plebiscite because of its complex procedure of amendment and opposition from the leaders of Jammu and Kashmir.<ref name=\"timesofindia.indiatimes.com2\"/>\n* Article 370 allows its own death by permitting plebiscite. Article 370 was drafted while negotiations with Pakistan were still on. When Pakistan objected to Article 370 at the UN Commission Girija Shankar Bajpai, who was secretary general of Ministry of External Affairs, wrote to UNCIP in 1949 that Article 370 did not preclude plebiscite. Krishna Menon said to the UN Security Council in 1957 that if people of Kashmir voted to not stay with India then India's duty at that time would be to adopt those constitutional procedures which would enable separation of Kashmir from India. That procedure is contained in clause 3 of Article 370, a presidential order to declare that the Article 370 will cease to be operative.<ref name=\":3\">Noorani, A.

The Raja of Jammu [[Gulab Singh]], who was a vassal of the [[Sikh Empire]] and an influential noble in the Sikh court, sent expeditions to various border kingdoms and ended up encircling Kashmir by 1840.  Following the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] (1845{{ndash}}1846), Kashmir was ceded under the [[Treaty of Lahore]] to the [[East India Company]], which transferred it to Gulab Singh through the [[Treaty of Amritsar, 1846|Treaty of Amritsar]], in return for the payment of indemnity owed by the Sikh empire. Gulab Singh took the title of the [[Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir]]. From then until the 1947 [[partition of India]], Kashmir was ruled by the Maharajas of the [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|Kashmir and Jammu]].

Others fled to West Pakistan, some of whom made their way to the western districts of Poonch and Mirpur, which were [[1947 Poonch Rebellion|undergoing rebellion]].

Amanullah Khan moved to England and there NLF was renamed [[Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front]] (JKLF).\n\nShortly after 1965 war, Kashmiri Pandit activist and writer, Prem Nath Bazaz wrote that the overwhelming majority of Kashmir's Muslims were unfriendly to India and wanted to get rid of the political setup, but did not want to use violence for this purpose.

Critics of Sheikh hold the view that he gave up the cherished goal of plebiscite for gaining Chief Minister's chair. He started talks with the then Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] for normalizing the situation in the region and came to an accord with her, called [[1974 Indira-Sheikh accord|1975 Indira-Sheikh accord]], by giving up the demand for a plebiscite in lieu of the people being given the right to self-rule by a democratically elected Government (as envisaged under [[article 370 of the Constitution of India]]), rather than the \"puppet government\" which is said to have ruled the state until then.<ref name=\":626\">{{Cite book |title=Abdullah, Sheikh; Taing, M.

On the other hand, Farooq Abdullah allied with the [[Mirwaiz Maulvi Farooq|Mirwaiz Maulvi Mohammed Farooq]] for the elections and charged that the state's autonomy had been eroded by successive Congress Party governments. The strategies yielded dividends and the Congress won 26 seats, while the NC secured 46.

Both countries subsequently made claims to Kashmir, based on the history and religious affiliations of the Kashmiri people. The [[princely state]] of [[Jammu and Kashmir]], which lies strategically in the north-west of the subcontinent bordering Afghanistan and China, was formerly ruled by Maharaja [[Hari Singh]] under the [[paramountcy]] of [[British Raj|British India]]. In geographical and legal terms, the Maharaja could have joined either of the two new countries. Although urged by the Viceroy, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten of Burma]], to determine the future of his state before the transfer of power took place, Singh demurred. In October 1947, incursions by Pakistan took place leading to a [[1947 war|war]], as a result of which the state of Jammu and Kashmir remains divided between India and Pakistan.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Bose offers a number of possible explanations for this. Azad Kashmir's strong pro-Pakistan allegiances and a relatively smaller population are suggested as reasons. But Bose believes that a stronger explanation was that Pakistan had itself been a military-bureaucratic state for most of its history without stable democratic institutions. According to Bose, the Kashmiri Muslims had higher expectations from India which turned out to be a \"moderately successful\" democracy and it was in this context that Kashmiri Muslim rage spilled over after the rigging of the elections in 1987.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ACMe9WBdNAC |title=Kashmir: ROOTS OF CONFLICT, PATHS TO PEACE |last=Bose |first=Sumantra |isbn= 9780674028555|location= |pages=99\u2013100|date=June 2009 }}</ref> The residents of Azad Kashmir are also mostly Punjabi, differing in ethnicity from Kashmiris in the Indian administered section of the state.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEqRAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA153#v=onepage |title=The Territorial Management of Ethnic Conflict |date=2 August 2004 |publisher=Routledge |pages=153 |last1=Coakley |first1=John|isbn=9781135764425 }}</ref>\n\n====Gilgit-Baltistan====\nThe main demand of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan is constitutional status for the region as a fifth province of Pakistan.<ref name = indian_express>{{cite web |author=Nadeem |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/gilgitbaltistan-a-question-of-autonomy/519428/1 |title=Gilgit-Baltistan: A question of autonomy |date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref name = gilgit_polls /> However, Pakistan claims that Gilgit-Baltistan cannot be given constitutional status due to Pakistan's commitment to the 1948 UN resolution.<ref name=gilgit_polls>{{cite news |last=Shigri |first=Manzar |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5AB1ZE20091112 |title=Pakistan's disputed Northern Areas go to polls |agency=Reuters |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=dawn_gilgit>{{cite web |url=http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |title=DAWN: Gilgit-Baltistan autonomy |work=Dawn |location=Pakistan |accessdate=6 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601035500/http://archives.dawn.com/archives/30198 |archivedate=1 June 2012|date=9 September 2009 }}</ref> In 2007, the [[International Crisis Group]] stated that \"Almost six decades after Pakistan's independence, the constitutional status of the Federally Administered Northern Areas (Gilgit and Baltistan), once part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir and now under Pakistani control, remains undetermined, with political autonomy a distant dream.

Unofficially, the Pakistani leadership has indicated that they would be willing to accept alternatives such as a demilitarised Kashmir, if sovereignty of Azad Kashmir was to be extended over the Kashmir valley, or the \"Chenab\" formula, by which India would retain parts of Kashmir on its side of the Chenab river, and Pakistan the other side{{mdash}}effectively re-partitioning Kashmir on communal lines. The problem with the proposal is that the population of the Pakistan-administered portion of Kashmir is for the most part ethnically, linguistically, and culturally different from the [[Valley of Kashmir]], a part of Indian-administered Kashmir. Partition based on the Chenab formula is opposed by some Kashmiri politicians, although others, including [[Sajjad Lone]], have suggested that the non-Muslim part of Jammu and Kashmir be separated from Kashmir and handed to India. Some political analysts say that the Pakistan state policy shift and mellowing of its aggressive stance may have to do with its total failure in the [[Kargil War]] and the subsequent [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] attacks.
