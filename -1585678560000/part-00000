It ranked among the top 200 names for girls since 1965 and among the top 100 names for girls since 1976.

It fell off the top 1,000 list once again until 1964, when it reappeared in 472nd place, and leapt another 293 places to 179th place in the ratings in 1965. The name's popularity coincided with the debut in 1964 of the television show ''[[Bewitched]],'' which featured as the lead character a young witch named [[Samantha Stephens]]. \n\nThe name has remained consistently popular in the United States since the 1960s. It ranked among the top 200 names for girls since 1965 and among the top 100 names for girls since 1976. It was among the 10 most popular names for girls born in the United States between 1988 and 2006. It ranked as the 15th most popular name for American girls born in 2009.<ref>[http://www.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/babyname.cgi ssa.gov]</ref>\n\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] '''Samantha''' is used as a [[masculine]] [[given name]], being one of the forms of the name of the god ''[[Saman (deity)|Saman]]''.
