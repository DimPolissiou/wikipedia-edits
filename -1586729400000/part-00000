The regiment consists of four [[battalion]]s, three in the Regular Force and one in the [[primary reserve]]. The RCR is ranked 9th in the order of precedence amongst Canadian Army regiments, but is the most senior infantry regiment that has regular force battalions.\n\nThe RCR was originally authorized as the Infantry School Corps on 21 December 1883, and established its first three [[Company (military unit)|company]] stations at Fredericton, New Brunswick; St Jean, Quebec; and Toronto, Ontario. In 1887 a fourth company was authorized and the next year was established at [[London, Ontario]]. Now consisting of three Regular Force battalions and one Reserve Force battalion, the regiment's four battalions are now stationed in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]]. With many of its soldiers drawn from Ontario and the [[Atlantic Provinces]] in recent decades, the regiment maintains a general connection as the \"local\" infantry regiment for anglophone eastern Canada.\n\nThe RCR maintains a Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) in [[Petawawa, Ontario]], which has no operational command role but handles regimental affairs outside the responsibility of the individual battalions. The [[Royal Canadian Regiment Museum]] is located within historic Wolseley Hall in London, Ontario. [[Wolseley Barracks]] in London has been continuously occupied by some element of the regiment since construction of Wolseley Hall was completed in 1888.  At various times Wolseley Barracks has been the home of the Regimental Headquarters, the 1st and 2nd Battalions, and remains the home of the 4th Battalion today.\n\n==Battalions==\n[[File:\u0423 \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0456 \u043d\u0430 \u0425\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0448\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0437 \u043d\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438 27-\u0457 \u0440\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0456 \u041d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 (30453365858).jpg|thumb|An officer of the 3rd Battalion, RCR on parade in [[Kiev]], August 2018.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2012 the regiment was assigned the perpetuation of the 1st Regiment of Middlesex Militia (1812\u201315) and the 1st Regiment of Oxford Militia (1812\u201315) from the [[War of 1812]], and as a result carries three battle honours from that conflict. The RCR was also assigned the perpetuation of The Loyal London Volunteers which was accompanied by a non-emblazonable Honorary Distinction.\n\nThe regiment itself was formed as the Infantry School Corps on 21 December 1883, authorized by a Militia Act which also created the [[Royal Canadian Dragoons|Cavalry School Corps]]. These school corps were created as regular units that would train the Canadian militia. The first companies stood up in Fredericton NB, St Jean-sur-Richelieu QC, and Toronto ON in 1883, with a fourth company standing up in London ON several years later.\n\nThe Infantry School Corps' first [[battle honours]] were earned during the [[North-West Rebellion]] in 1885, where it fought at [[Battle of Batoche|Batoche]] and [[Battle of Cut Knife|Cut Knife Creek]]. The regiment later provided personnel to the [[Yukon Field Force]] (1898\u20131900), which assisted the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in the [[Yukon]] during the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Gold Rush]]. The regiment served in the South African (Boer) War (1899\u20131903). Its Great War deployment was delayed by a garrison assignment in Bermuda from September 1914 until August 1915.  Upon returning to Nova Scotia, its members attested for overseas service with the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), arriving in France in October 1915 to fight in WW1.<ref>http://guysboroughgreatwarveterans.blogspot.ca/2012/12/the-25th-battalion-nova-scotia-rifles.html</ref>\n\n===The South African War===\n[[File:William D Otter.JPG|150px|thumb|LCol William Dillon Otter]]\nThe regiment's name was changed to The Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry in 1893, with a new emphasis on being combat capable. [[William Dillon Otter]], formerly of [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada]], was the first [[Commanding Officer]]. He would later become the first Canadian-born [[Commander of the Canadian Army|Chief of the General Staff]], the head of the [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|Canadian Army]].\n\nDuring the South African War ([[Second Boer War]]), the \"2nd (Special Service) Battalion\" was raised from across the country to contribute Canada's First Contingent in this war, with Otter in command.<ref name=\"cwm-boerwar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/boer/infantryregiment_e.shtml|title=Canada & The South African War, 1899\u20131902 \u2013 2nd (Special Service) Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry|publisher=[[Canadian War Museum]]|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> This battalion was quickly disbanded in 1900 upon its return to Canada, even though they were considered by many British officers to be the best infantry battalion in the country. The [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|\"3rd (Special Service) Battalion\"]] was also raised at this time, in 1900, and was employed as a garrison force in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] until 1902 when it was also disbanded.\n[[File:1908 Toronto SouthAfrican War Memorial QueenSt.jpg|left|thumb|The unveiling of the ''South African War Memorial'' in [[Toronto]] Canada in 1908]]\n\nIn the Boer War, the Toronto company of the 2RCRI fought Canada's first overseas battle at Sunnyside, Cape Colony, on January 1, 1900, defeating a Boer commando in an action led by Australia's Queensland Mounted Infantry. The unit as a whole then joined and played an instrumental role in the victory at the [[Battle of Paardeberg|Battle of Paardeberg Drift]] (18\u201327 February 1900), including an advance by night towards the enemy lines, quietly digging trenches on high ground 65 yards from the Boer lines. On February 27, 1900, the Boers, staring into the muzzles of Canadian and British rifles, surrendered, thus removing the commando blocking the way to the first Boer capital, Bloemfontein, Orange Free State. This date has since been celebrated by the Regiment as [[Paardeberg Day]]. Having delivered the first unqualified good news of the war for the British Empire, the Regiment also distinguished itself on the march north, arriving first at the gates of [[Pretoria]].\n\nDuring the South African War Private Richard Rowland Thompson<ref name=\"thercr1\">[http://thercr.ca/honours_awards/queens_scarf.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311002335/http://thercr.ca/honours_awards/queens_scarf.htm |date=March 11, 2007 }}</ref> was awarded a Queen's scarf,<ref name=\"thercr1\"/> one of the four presented to soldiers of the Dominions, a further four scarves crocheted by Queen Victoria went to non-commissioned officers of the [[British Army]].\n\nA small statuette (1999) by [[Andr\u00e9 Gauthier (sculptor)]] commemorates the centennial of the Royal Canadian Regiment's [[Battle of Paardeberg]] during the [[Boer War]].\n\n===The end of the Victorian era and the Great War; 1900\u20131919===\nIn October 1901 the regiment received new colours from the Duke of Cornwall and York (later [[George V|King George V]]) during his visit to Canada,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Royal tour|day_of_week=Monday |date=21 October 1901 |page_number=3 |issue=36591| }}</ref> and the regiment's name was changed to The Royal Canadian Regiment. In 1914, the regiment was deployed to [[Bermuda]] for garrison duties from September 1914 to August 1915 when it returned to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and reattested for overseas service. The RCR arrived in France in October 1915 to join the new [[3rd Canadian Division]]. The regiment combined with [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] and the 42nd and 49th Canadian Infantry Battalions to form the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Battle honours awarded to The Royal Canadian Regiment for its actions in the First World War included:  \"Mount Sorrel, [[Somme (department)|Somme]], 1916, Flers-Courcelette, Ancre Heights, [[Arras]], 1917, 18, [[Vimy]], 1917, [[Hill 70]], [[Ypres]], 1917, [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], [[Amiens]], [[Battle of the Scarpe (1918)|Scarpe]], 1918, [[Hindenburg Line]], Canal du Nord, Pursuit to [[Mons]], FRANCE AND FLANDERS, 1914\u201318\".<ref>Canadian Army General Order 110 of 1929</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RCR CEF.svg|thumb|200px|The distinguishing patch of The RCR as part of the 7th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Canadian Division of the CEF.]] -->\n\nAmong the honours and awards to members of the regiment in the First World War was the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) won by Lieutenant [[Milton Gregg]]. The RCR also recognizes the VC won by Lieutenant [[Frederick William Campbell]], who was an officer of the 1st (Western Ontario) Battalion of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]], one of the battalions now perpetuated by The RCR.\n\n===The inter-war years; 1919\u20131939===\nThe RCR remained a Permanent Force regiment between the wars and returned to its role of providing instruction to the Militia through garrisons in London ([[Ontario]]), [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] ([[Nova Scotia]]), [[Toronto]] (Ontario) and [[Montreal]] ([[Quebec]]).\n\n===The Second World War; 1939\u20131945===\nOn 1 September 1939 the regiment was mobilized as part of the Canadian Active Service Force as Canada prepared for participation in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. When war was declared on September 10, the RCR had already been allocated to the [[1st Brigade (Canada)|1st Canadian Infantry Brigade]], a formation made up entirely of Ontario units. Moving to the [[United Kingdom]] in December 1939 as a component of the [[1st Canadian Division|1st Canadian Infantry Division]], the RCR saw hard training for almost four years.\n\nOn 10 July 1943, the RCR landed at [[Pachino]] in the opening waves of the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] \u2013 the last member of the regiment to participate in these original waves \u2013 George F. Burrows of Chatham Ontario \u2013 died on April 11, 2012, in Windsor, Ontario at the age of 88. The regiment and its sister units in the 1st Brigade, [[The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment]] and the [[48th Highlanders of Canada]] fought in several battles as the division advanced north and then east towards Messina. After the 38-day campaign on the island was completed, the regiment was involved in another [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landing]] (codenamed [[Operation Baytown]]) at [[Reggio di Calabria]], as part of [[Allied invasion of Italy|Allied invasion of the Italian mainland]] in September.\n\nThe RCR fought in several battles of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]], including key engagements in the [[Moro River Campaign|Moro River]] valley near [[Battle of Ortona|Ortona]] in December 1943. During 1944, the regiment took part the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] in attacks on German defensive lines called the [[Hitler Line]] and later the [[Gothic Line]].\n\nThe regiment was transferred to northwest Europe in February 1945 during [[Operation Goldflake]] and took part in the liberation the Dutch city of [[Apeldoorn]]. The regiment received 28 battle honours for its participation in the Second World War.<ref>Canadian Army Orders, Issue No. 597, 26 May 1958</ref> The regiment returned home to Canada in 1945.\n\n===The post-war period and the Korean War; 1945\u20131953===\nIn 1950 the regiment was called upon to contribute to Canada's forces for the [[Korean War]].  A new [[Active Service Force (Special Force)]] was to be raised, and the regiment expanded to a two-battalion, then a three-battalion, organization. The 2nd Battalion, followed by the 1st and [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalions]], each saw service in Korea.  The 2nd Battalion helped stabilize the 38th parallel, most notably at the Chail-li sector. In October 1952, the 1st Battalion fought the Chinese at the [[battle of Kowang-san]] (Hill 355 \u2013 Little Gibraltar).  It was replaced by the [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]], which took over the Jamestown Line on Hill 187, where it fought one of the last engagements before the armistice in 1953.  After the end of the Korean War, the regiment was reduced to two battalions, when the [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]] was disbanded in July 1954.\n\n===The Cold War; 1953\u20131992===\nIn 1954 two London, Ontario, Militia regiments, the Canadian Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) (MG) and The Oxford Rifles were amalgamated and redesignated The London and Oxford Fusiliers (3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment).  This unit thus became the Reserve component of The RCR. In 1958, it was renamed 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment (London and Oxford Fusiliers).\n\nIn 1989, the designation of the Reserve battalion was shortened to 4th Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.4rcr.ca/history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019104751/http://www.4rcr.ca/history.html |archive-date=2007-10-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This amalgamation also brought to the regiment the perpetuation of a number of battalions of the First World War [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]], including the 1st, 33rd, 71st, 142nd and 168th Battalions as well as the 2nd Battalion of the [[Canadian Machine Gun Corps]]. The amalgamation also saw the total battle honours for the First World War, based on the combined list of amalgamated components of the regiment, increase to the full list seen below.\n\nThe Militia battalion (3rd Battalion) was renumbered as the 4th Battalion in 1970 when the [[Canadian Guards]] were reduced to nil strength and the soldiers of that regiment's 2nd Battalion (at [[CFB Petawawa]]) became the restored [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]], The RCR, on the Regular Force order of battle.  At the same time, the 2nd Battalion of The RCR was relocated to [[CFB Gagetown]], [[New Brunswick]], and reconstituted from the soldiers of the [[Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada]] as its two battalions there were also reduced to nil strength and removed from the active regiments in the army's Regular Force order of battle.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, battalions of The RCR were stationed as part of [[4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group]] at Fort York, Germany. These deployments were executed by 1RCR (1955\u201357 and 1962\u201365) and 2RCR (1953\u201355 and 1965\u201370). [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]] was later deployed to Germany, stationed in Baden-S\u00f6llingen 1977\u201384 and 1988\u201393.\n\nAll three Regular Force battalions of The RCR were deployed during the [[October Crisis]] in 1970 as part of the government's response to the [[FLQ]]. Major [[John Hasek]] became the first commander of the [[Skyhawks Parachute Team]] when it formed in 1971. The three Regular Force battalions were also deployed in to support the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].\n\nThroughout the [[Cold War]] period, The RCR participated in Canada's contributions to [[United Nations]] [[peacekeeping]].

Elements of the regiment garrisoned at Saint John sur Richelieu from 1884\u20131908 and 1924\u2013.\n\nIn 1984 the battalion was rotated to [[Winnipeg]].  In 1988 the battalion was rotated back to Baden until the base was closed in 1993 at which time it was disbanded in Germany and subsequently stood up at [[CFB Borden]], Ontario, as a \"10/90\" battalion.  The \"10/90\" concept created an infantry battalion in each Regular Force regiment with approximately 10 per cent of its personnel being full-time Regular soldiers, while the remaining positions were filled by Reserve Force soldiers from affiliated units in the region.  These units existed until 1996 when the three 10/90 battalions were stood down and replaced by light infantry battalions on the Regular Force order of battle. Initially formed without specific regimental affiliation, within the year the light infantry battalion was relocated to [[CFB Petawawa]] and officially designated the [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]], The RCR.\n\nIn 1990, HQ and Duke of Edinburgh's Company (the first rifle company) of the 1st Battalion deployed to Cornwall, Ontario, as part of Operation [[Kahnawake]]. The 2nd Battalion, as part of [[5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group]], deployed to the Montreal region to partake in Operation Salon.

This operation saw a redeployment of the entire battle group from Croatia to the Sarajevo Theatre of Operations, under the command of General [[Lewis MacKenzie]].\n\n[[Elizabeth II]], [[Queen of Canada]], made mention of this operational force and its commitment to international peace while she was in the [[National Capital Region]] that same year during Canada's 125th, stating:\n\n{{quote|text=I am delighted to be here with you once again, to share in this day of national celebration, and, as a member of the Canadian family, to wish Canada a happy birthday on this one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary of Confederation.

The 1st Battalion served in [[Kosovo]] under NATO mission [[Operation Kinetic]], Rotation 1, December 1999\u2013May 2000.\n\nIn 2000, the 2nd Battalion had the honour of mounting the [[Queen's Guard]] at [[Buckingham Palace]], when a detachment came to London to commemorate the Canadian involvement in the [[Second Boer War]], and to celebrate the re-opening of [[Canada House]].  Later that year, H Company Group of 2nd Battalion deployed to eastern Africa as part of UNMEE.\nAs the United States prepared militarily and politically to launch military actions against Iraq, 2 RCR formed a provisional battle group and was warned off that if the government decided to participate, it would deploy.  The government decided against participation and instead decided to return to Afghanistan.  I Company Group deployed to Kabul on 26 May 2003 to form the Defence and Security Company for the construction of the Canadian camp.  It returned to Canada in August of that year after [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion Group]] took on ISAF operations.\n\nThe \"Leadership Award\"(2000) by [[Andr\u00e9 Gauthier (sculptor)]] was commissioned for The Royal Canadian Regiment.\n\nIn March 2004 the same company deployed to [[Port-au-Prince]], Haiti, as part of Operation Halo (Operation \"Secure Tomorrow\" as the United States called it) to conduct security operations as part of the Multinational Interim Force.  This force was set in place in order to set the conditions for the United Nations to take over.  I Company conducted a relief in place with H Company Group in June.

The right to wear the imperial cypher and crown was granted to the regiment by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1893.\n\nWhen a royal or imperial cypher forms part of the badge of a regiment it is normal for it to change with each succeeding sovereign. During the period 1901 to 1919, the officially authorized versions of the regiment's cap badge were those with [[Edward VII]]'s and [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]'s cyphers, although the regiment continued to use the \"VRI\" ensigned badges throughout this time while petitioning for their formal return.  In 1919, George V granted The Royal Canadian Regiment permission to wear \"VRI\" in perpetuity \u2013 a unique privilege.\n\n==Company designations==\nThe companies of the battalions of The RCR are lettered sequentially across the regiment:\n* 1st Battalion \u2013 A to F\n* 2nd Battalion \u2013 G to L\n* [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]] \u2013 M to R\n* 4th Battalion \u2013 S, T and X (S Company consists of a Company Headquarters as well as two rifle platoons located in London, Ontario, and 3 Platoon located in Stratford, Ontario. T Company consists of a Company Headquarters located in Stratford, Ontario, and X Company consists of the Battalion Headquarters personnel.)\n\nIn the Regular Force battalions, the first four companies are rifle companies, and the latter two are combat support (weapons) and administration company (combat service support).\n\nWhen on parade, companies parade in alphabetic order. Companies are normally addressed by the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] for their designation letter with the following exceptions:\n* A Coy, 1RCR, is designated and always referred to as \"Duke of Edinburgh's Company\" or, colloquially, \"Duke's Company\"\n* C Coy, 1RCR, is known as \"Charles\" Company. This unique designation was adopted during the Korean War, as the company was noted for maintaining a very high standard of dress and deportment.<ref>[http://theroyalcanadianregiment.ca/customs_traditions/charles_company.html The Royal Canadian Regiment \u2013 \"Charles\" Company<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* M Coy, [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3RCR]], is often referred to as \"Para\" Company, short for Parachute Company, at the discretion of the commanding officer, although this title is not officially recognized by the regiment as other than a colloquial nickname, even as the 3rd Battalion is now airborne-capable\n\n==Regimental bands==\n\n===Bugles and Drums===\nThe first band of The RCR was formed under \"A\" Company of the Infantry School Corps in 1894, when Sergeant Charles Hayes, a graduate of [[Kneller Hall]] Music College, enlisted in January 1894.<ref>The Royal Canadian Regiment; 1883\u20131933, by Fetherstonagh</ref> That same year the corps also reported training nine buglers for the Militia.\n\nBy 1899, the authorized establishment for the regiment included four \"Sergt.

The RCR Band, in contrast, was a professional brass and reed band manned by military musicians. The band in its final state was formed in [[London, Ontario|London]] in the 1950s, transferred to [[CFB Gagetown]] in the 1970s and disbanded in the 1990s.

The regiment consists of four [[battalion]]s, three in the Regular Force and one in the [[primary reserve]]. The RCR is ranked 9th in the order of precedence amongst Canadian Army regiments, but is the most senior infantry regiment that has regular force battalions.\n\nThe RCR was originally authorized as the Infantry School Corps on 21 December 1883, and established its first three [[Company (military unit)|company]] stations at Fredericton, New Brunswick; St Jean, Quebec; and Toronto, Ontario. In 1887 a fourth company was authorized and the next year was established at [[London, Ontario]]. Now consisting of three Regular Force battalions and one Reserve Force battalion, the regiment's four battalions are now stationed in [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]]. With many of its soldiers drawn from Ontario and the [[Atlantic Provinces]] in recent decades, the regiment maintains a general connection as the \"local\" infantry regiment for anglophone eastern Canada.\n\nThe RCR maintains a Regimental Headquarters (RHQ) in [[Petawawa, Ontario]], which has no operational command role but handles regimental affairs outside the responsibility of the individual battalions. The [[Royal Canadian Regiment Museum]] is located within historic Wolseley Hall in London, Ontario. [[Wolseley Barracks]] in London has been continuously occupied by some element of the regiment since construction of Wolseley Hall was completed in 1888.  At various times Wolseley Barracks has been the home of the Regimental Headquarters, the 1st and 2nd Battalions, and remains the home of the 4th Battalion today.\n\n==Battalions==\n[[File:\u0423 \u041a\u0438\u0454\u0432\u0456 \u043d\u0430 \u0425\u0440\u0435\u0449\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0443 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0448\u043e\u0432 \u0432\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434 \u0437 \u043d\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438 27-\u0457 \u0440\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0456 \u041d\u0435\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 (30453365858).jpg|thumb|A officer of the 3rd Battalion, RCR on parade in [[Kiev]], August 2018.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In 2012 the regiment was assigned the perpetuation of the 1st Regiment of Middlesex Militia (1812\u201315) and the 1st Regiment of Oxford Militia (1812\u201315) from the [[War of 1812]], and as a result carries three battle honours from that conflict. The RCR was also assigned the perpetuation of The Loyal London Volunteers which was accompanied by a non-emblazonable Honorary Distinction.\n\nThe regiment itself was formed as the Infantry School Corps on 21 December 1883, authorized by a Militia Act which also created the [[Royal Canadian Dragoons|Cavalry School Corps]]. These school corps were created as regular units that would train the Canadian militia. The first companies stood up in Fredericton NB, St Jean-sur-Richelieu QC, and Toronto ON in 1883, with a fourth company standing up in London ON several years later.\n\nThe Infantry School Corps' first [[battle honours]] were earned during the [[North-West Rebellion]] in 1885, where it fought at [[Battle of Batoche|Batoche]] and [[Battle of Cut Knife|Cut Knife Creek]]. The regiment later provided personnel to the [[Yukon Field Force]] (1898\u20131900), which assisted the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in the [[Yukon]] during the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Gold Rush]]. The regiment served in the South African (Boer) War (1899\u20131903). Its Great War deployment was delayed by a garrison assignment in Bermuda from September 1914 until August 1915.  Upon returning to Nova Scotia, its members attested for overseas service with the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), arriving in France in October 1915 to fight in WW1.<ref>http://guysboroughgreatwarveterans.blogspot.ca/2012/12/the-25th-battalion-nova-scotia-rifles.html</ref>\n\n===The South African War===\n[[File:William D Otter.JPG|150px|thumb|LCol William Dillon Otter]]\nThe regiment's name was changed to The Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry in 1893, with a new emphasis on being combat capable. [[William Dillon Otter]], formerly of [[The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada]], was the first [[Commanding Officer]]. He would later become the first Canadian-born [[Commander of the Canadian Army|Chief of the General Staff]], the head of the [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|Canadian Army]].\n\nDuring the South African War ([[Second Boer War]]), the \"2nd (Special Service) Battalion\" was raised from across the country to contribute Canada's First Contingent in this war, with Otter in command.<ref name=\"cwm-boerwar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/boer/infantryregiment_e.shtml|title=Canada & The South African War, 1899\u20131902 \u2013 2nd (Special Service) Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment of Infantry|publisher=[[Canadian War Museum]]|accessdate=2009-07-13}}</ref> This battalion was quickly disbanded in 1900 upon its return to Canada, even though they were considered by many British officers to be the best infantry battalion in the country. The [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|\"3rd (Special Service) Battalion\"]] was also raised at this time, in 1900, and was employed as a garrison force in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] until 1902 when it was also disbanded.\n[[File:1908 Toronto SouthAfrican War Memorial QueenSt.jpg|left|thumb|The unveiling of the ''South African War Memorial'' in [[Toronto]] Canada in 1908]]\n\nIn the Boer War, the Toronto company of the 2RCRI fought Canada's first overseas battle at Sunnyside, Cape Colony, on January 1, 1900, defeating a Boer commando in an action led by Australia's Queensland Mounted Infantry. The unit as a whole then joined and played an instrumental role in the victory at the [[Battle of Paardeberg|Battle of Paardeberg Drift]] (18\u201327 February 1900), including an advance by night towards the enemy lines, quietly digging trenches on high ground 65 yards from the Boer lines. On February 27, 1900, the Boers, staring into the muzzles of Canadian and British rifles, surrendered, thus removing the commando blocking the way to the first Boer capital, Bloemfontein, Orange Free State. This date has since been celebrated by the Regiment as [[Paardeberg Day]]. Having delivered the first unqualified good news of the war for the British Empire, the Regiment also distinguished itself on the march north, arriving first at the gates of [[Pretoria]].\n\nDuring the South African War Private Richard Rowland Thompson<ref name=\"thercr1\">[http://thercr.ca/honours_awards/queens_scarf.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311002335/http://thercr.ca/honours_awards/queens_scarf.htm |date=March 11, 2007 }}</ref> was awarded a Queen's scarf,<ref name=\"thercr1\"/> one of the four presented to soldiers of the Dominions, a further four scarves crocheted by Queen Victoria went to non-commissioned officers of the [[British Army]].\n\nA small statuette (1999) by [[Andr\u00e9 Gauthier (sculptor)]] commemorates the centennial of the Royal Canadian Regiment's [[Battle of Paardeberg]] during the [[Boer War]].\n\n===The end of the Victorian era and the Great War; 1900\u20131919===\nIn October 1901 the regiment received new colours from the Duke of Cornwall and York (later [[George V|King George V]]) during his visit to Canada,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Royal tour|day_of_week=Monday |date=21 October 1901 |page_number=3 |issue=36591| }}</ref> and the regiment's name was changed to The Royal Canadian Regiment. In 1914, the regiment was deployed to [[Bermuda]] for garrison duties from September 1914 to August 1915 when it returned to [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] and reattested for overseas service. The RCR arrived in France in October 1915 to join the new [[3rd Canadian Division]]. The regiment combined with [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]] and the 42nd and 49th Canadian Infantry Battalions to form the 7th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Battle honours awarded to The Royal Canadian Regiment for its actions in the First World War included:  \"Mount Sorrel, [[Somme (department)|Somme]], 1916, Flers-Courcelette, Ancre Heights, [[Arras]], 1917, 18, [[Vimy]], 1917, [[Hill 70]], [[Ypres]], 1917, [[Battle of Passchendaele|Passchendaele]], [[Amiens]], [[Battle of the Scarpe (1918)|Scarpe]], 1918, [[Hindenburg Line]], Canal du Nord, Pursuit to [[Mons]], FRANCE AND FLANDERS, 1914\u201318\".<ref>Canadian Army General Order 110 of 1929</ref>\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RCR CEF.svg|thumb|200px|The distinguishing patch of The RCR as part of the 7th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Canadian Division of the CEF.]] -->\n\nAmong the honours and awards to members of the regiment in the First World War was the [[Victoria Cross]] (VC) won by Lieutenant [[Milton Gregg]]. The RCR also recognizes the VC won by Lieutenant [[Frederick William Campbell]], who was an officer of the 1st (Western Ontario) Battalion of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]], one of the battalions now perpetuated by The RCR.\n\n===The inter-war years; 1919\u20131939===\nThe RCR remained a Permanent Force regiment between the wars and returned to its role of providing instruction to the Militia through garrisons in London ([[Ontario]]), [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] ([[Nova Scotia]]), [[Toronto]] (Ontario) and [[Montreal]] ([[Quebec]]).\n\n===The Second World War; 1939\u20131945===\nOn 1 September 1939 the regiment was mobilized as part of the Canadian Active Service Force as Canada prepared for participation in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. When war was declared on September 10, the RCR had already been allocated to the [[1st Brigade (Canada)|1st Canadian Infantry Brigade]], a formation made up entirely of Ontario units. Moving to the [[United Kingdom]] in December 1939 as a component of the [[1st Canadian Division|1st Canadian Infantry Division]], the RCR saw hard training for almost four years.\n\nOn 10 July 1943, the RCR landed at [[Pachino]] in the opening waves of the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] \u2013 the last member of the regiment to participate in these original waves \u2013 George F. Burrows of Chatham Ontario \u2013 died on April 11, 2012, in Windsor, Ontario at the age of 88. The regiment and its sister units in the 1st Brigade, [[The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment]] and the [[48th Highlanders of Canada]] fought in several battles as the division advanced north and then east towards Messina. After the 38-day campaign on the island was completed, the regiment was involved in another [[Amphibious warfare|amphibious landing]] (codenamed [[Operation Baytown]]) at [[Reggio di Calabria]], as part of [[Allied invasion of Italy|Allied invasion of the Italian mainland]] in September.\n\nThe RCR fought in several battles of the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian campaign]], including key engagements in the [[Moro River Campaign|Moro River]] valley near [[Battle of Ortona|Ortona]] in December 1943. During 1944, the regiment took part the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]] in attacks on German defensive lines called the [[Hitler Line]] and later the [[Gothic Line]].\n\nThe regiment was transferred to northwest Europe in February 1945 during [[Operation Goldflake]] and took part in the liberation the Dutch city of [[Apeldoorn]]. The regiment received 28 battle honours for its participation in the Second World War.<ref>Canadian Army Orders, Issue No. 597, 26 May 1958</ref> The regiment returned home to Canada in 1945.\n\n===The post-war period and the Korean War; 1945\u20131953===\nIn 1950 the regiment was called upon to contribute to Canada's forces for the [[Korean War]].  A new [[Active Service Force (Special Force)]] was to be raised, and the regiment expanded to a two-battalion, then a three-battalion, organization. The 2nd Battalion, followed by the 1st and [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalions]], each saw service in Korea.  The 2nd Battalion helped stabilize the 38th parallel, most notably at the Chail-li sector. In October 1952, the 1st Battalion fought the Chinese at the [[battle of Kowang-san]] (Hill 355 \u2013 Little Gibraltar).  It was replaced by the [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]], which took over the Jamestown Line on Hill 187, where it fought one of the last engagements before the armistice in 1953.  After the end of the Korean War, the regiment was reduced to two battalions, when the [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]] was disbanded in July 1954.\n\n===The Cold War; 1953\u20131992===\nIn 1954 two London, Ontario, Militia regiments, the Canadian Fusiliers (City of London Regiment) (MG) and The Oxford Rifles were amalgamated and redesignated The London and Oxford Fusiliers (3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment).  This unit thus became the Reserve component of The RCR. In 1958, it was renamed 3rd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment (London and Oxford Fusiliers).\n\nIn 1989, the designation of the Reserve battalion was shortened to 4th Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.4rcr.ca/history.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019104751/http://www.4rcr.ca/history.html |archive-date=2007-10-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This amalgamation also brought to the regiment the perpetuation of a number of battalions of the First World War [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]], including the 1st, 33rd, 71st, 142nd and 168th Battalions as well as the 2nd Battalion of the [[Canadian Machine Gun Corps]]. The amalgamation also saw the total battle honours for the First World War, based on the combined list of amalgamated components of the regiment, increase to the full list seen below.\n\nThe Militia battalion (3rd Battalion) was renumbered as the 4th Battalion in 1970 when the [[Canadian Guards]] were reduced to nil strength and the soldiers of that regiment's 2nd Battalion (at [[CFB Petawawa]]) became the restored [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]], The RCR, on the Regular Force order of battle.  At the same time, the 2nd Battalion of The RCR was relocated to [[CFB Gagetown]], [[New Brunswick]], and reconstituted from the soldiers of the [[Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada]] as its two battalions there were also reduced to nil strength and removed from the active regiments in the army's Regular Force order of battle.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, battalions of The RCR were stationed as part of [[4 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group]] at Fort York, Germany. These deployments were executed by 1RCR (1955\u201357 and 1962\u201365) and 2RCR (1953\u201355 and 1965\u201370). [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]] was later deployed to Germany, stationed in Baden-S\u00f6llingen 1977\u201384 and 1988\u201393.\n\nAll three Regular Force battalions of The RCR were deployed during the [[October Crisis]] in 1970 as part of the government's response to the [[FLQ]]. Major [[John Hasek]] became the first commander of the [[Skyhawks Parachute Team]] when it formed in 1971. The three Regular Force battalions were also deployed in to support the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].\n\nThroughout the [[Cold War]] period, The RCR participated in Canada's contributions to [[United Nations]] [[peacekeeping]].  For battalions of the regiment, this meant rotating tours on the island of [[Cyprus]].  The six-month tours of this mission, named Operation Snowgoose, were executed by elements of the regiment 13 times<ref>[http://thercr.ca/history/general_history/rcr_ops_since_1945.htm The Royal Canadian Regiment \u2013 Operations Since 1945] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070908110621/http://thercr.ca/history/general_history/rcr_ops_since_1945.htm |date=September 8, 2007 }}</ref> between 1966 and 1992.\n\nIn 1977 the [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]] was posted to [[CFB Baden-Soellingen]] in Germany.\n\n[[File:Century of Service Plaque The Royal Canadian Regiment 1883-1983.jpg|thumb|right|Century of Service Plaque The Royal Canadian Regiment 1883\u20131983, Royal Canadian Military College Saint-Jean]]\nIn 1983, a Century of Service plaque at the [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] commemorates the centennial of the Royal Canadian Regiment, 1883\u20131983 Canada's oldest permanent force infantry regiment. Elements of the regiment garrisoned at Saint John sur Richelieu from 1884\u20131908 and 1924\u2013.\n\nIn 1984 the battalion was rotated to [[Winnipeg]].  In 1988 the battalion was rotated back to Baden until the base was closed in 1993 at which time it was disbanded in Germany and subsequently stood up at [[CFB Borden]], Ontario, as a \"10/90\" battalion.  The \"10/90\" concept created an infantry battalion in each Regular Force regiment with approximately 10 per cent of its personnel being full-time Regular soldiers, while the remaining positions were filled by Reserve Force soldiers from affiliated units in the region.  These units existed until 1996 when the three 10/90 battalions were stood down and replaced by light infantry battalions on the Regular Force order of battle. Initially formed without specific regimental affiliation, within the year the light infantry battalion was relocated to [[CFB Petawawa]] and officially designated the [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]], The RCR.\n\nIn 1990, HQ and Duke of Edinburgh's Company (the first rifle company) of the 1st Battalion deployed to Cornwall, Ontario, as part of Operation [[Kahnawake]]. The 2nd Battalion, as part of [[5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group]], deployed to the Montreal region to partake in Operation Salon.

This operation saw a redeployment of the entire battle group from Croatia to the Sarajevo Theatre of Operations, under the command of General [[Lewis MacKenzie]].\n\n[[Elizabeth II]], [[Queen of Canada]], made mention of this operational force and its commitment to international peace while she was in the [[National Capital Region]] that same year during Canada's 125th, stating:\n\n{{quote|text=I am delighted to be here with you once again, to share in this day of national celebration, and, as a member of the Canadian family, to wish Canada a happy birthday on this one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary of Confederation.

I want to say a special word about the brave Canadian soldiers who today seek to bring peace, under the United Nations auspices, to a dangerous situation in Bosnia. They serve both Canada and the cause of peace with courage and conviction. As Queen of Canada, I salute their contribution with pride ... You have inherited a country uniquely worth preserving. I call on you all, wherever you live, whatever your walk of life, to cherish that inheritance, and to protect it with all your strength.

The 1st Battalion served in [[Kosovo]] under NATO mission [[Operation Kinetic]], Rotation 1, December 1999\u2013May 2000.\n\nIn 2000, the 2nd Battalion had the honour of mounting the [[Queen's Guard]] at [[Buckingham Palace]], when a detachment came to London to commemorate the Canadian involvement in the [[Second Boer War]], and to celebrate the re-opening of [[Canada House]].  Later that year, H Company Group of 2nd Battalion deployed to eastern Africa as part of UNMEE.\nAs the United States prepared militarily and politically to launch military actions against Iraq, 2 RCR formed a provisional battle group and was warned off that if the government decided to participate, it would deploy.  The government decided against participation and instead decided to return to Afghanistan.  I Company Group deployed to Kabul on 26 May 2003 to form the Defence and Security Company for the construction of the Canadian camp.  It returned to Canada in August of that year after [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion Group]] took on ISAF operations.\n\nThe \"Leadership Award\"(2000) by [[Andr\u00e9 Gauthier (sculptor)]] was commissioned for The Royal Canadian Regiment.\n\nIn March 2004 the same company deployed to [[Port-au-Prince]], Haiti, as part of Operation Halo (Operation \"Secure Tomorrow\" as the United States called it) to conduct security operations as part of the Multinational Interim Force.  This force was set in place in order to set the conditions for the United Nations to take over.  I Company conducted a relief in place with H Company Group in June.  H Company changed roles to the UN force and redeployed to [[Gona\u00efves]], Haiti.

The right to wear the imperial cypher and crown was granted to the regiment by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1893.\n\nWhen a royal or imperial cypher forms part of the badge of a regiment it is normal for it to change with each succeeding sovereign. During the period 1901 to 1919, the officially authorized versions of the regiment's cap badge were those with [[Edward VII]]'s and [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]'s cyphers, although the regiment continued to use the \"VRI\" ensigned badges throughout this time while petitioning for their formal return.  In 1919, George V granted The Royal Canadian Regiment permission to wear \"VRI\" in perpetuity \u2013 a unique privilege.\n\n==Company designations==\nThe companies of the battalions of The RCR are lettered sequentially across the regiment:\n* 1st Battalion \u2013 A to F\n* 2nd Battalion \u2013 G to L\n* [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]] \u2013 M to R\n* 4th Battalion \u2013 S, T and X (S Company consists of a Company Headquarters as well as two rifle platoons located in London, Ontario, and 3 Platoon located in Stratford, Ontario. T Company consists of a Company Headquarters located in Stratford, Ontario, and X Company consists of the Battalion Headquarters personnel.)\n\nIn the Regular Force battalions, the first four companies are rifle companies, and the latter two are combat support (weapons) and administration company (combat service support).\n\nWhen on parade, companies parade in alphabetic order. Companies are normally addressed by the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]] for their designation letter with the following exceptions:\n* A Coy, 1RCR, is designated and always referred to as \"Duke of Edinburgh's Company\" or, colloquially, \"Duke's Company\"\n* C Coy, 1RCR, is known as \"Charles\" Company. This unique designation was adopted during the Korean War, as the company was noted for maintaining a very high standard of dress and deportment.<ref>[http://theroyalcanadianregiment.ca/customs_traditions/charles_company.html The Royal Canadian Regiment \u2013 \"Charles\" Company<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n* M Coy, [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3RCR]], is often referred to as \"Para\" Company, short for Parachute Company, at the discretion of the commanding officer, although this title is not officially recognized by the regiment as other than a colloquial nickname, even as the 3rd Battalion is now airborne-capable\n\n==Regimental bands==\n\n===Bugles and Drums===\nThe first band of The RCR was formed under \"A\" Company of the Infantry School Corps in 1894, when Sergeant Charles Hayes, a graduate of [[Kneller Hall]] Music College, enlisted in January 1894.<ref>The Royal Canadian Regiment; 1883\u20131933, by Fetherstonagh</ref> That same year the corps also reported training nine buglers for the Militia.\n\nBy 1899, the authorized establishment for the regiment included four \"Sergt.

With few lapses, the regiment maintained a Drum and Bugle band at least until the 1990s, when the 1st Battalion had a Drum and Bugle Corps within the ranks of C Company.<ref>http://www.dcxmuseum.org/assets/15%2520-%2520Canadian%2520Military%2520Drum%2520and%2520Bugle%2520Corps.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjEyq3ThP7fAhUR2qwKHRKFCnEQFjAfegQIBhAB&usg=AOvVaw2p9l-GZYX4FDm3EkT4dJFS {{dead link|date=January 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Pipes and Drums===\nIn 1970, following a review of the regular army, a number of infantry battalions were disbanded. The [[Canadian Guards]] and the [[Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada]] lost both of their regular battalions, with personnel being distributed to The Royal Canadian Regiment. The 2nd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment adopted the Pipes and Drums of the Black Watch, becoming the Pipes and Drums of the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027003650/http://geocities.com/Pentagon/9750/ 2nd Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment Pipes and Drums]</ref> The [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]] of The RCR, similarly, adopted the Pipes and Drums of the 2nd Battalion, [[The Canadian Guards]], when they were disbanded.<ref>Pipers of the Canadian Regular Army 1950\u20132000, by Pipe Major Hugh MacPherson CD, BA (Privately Published)</ref> In 1977 the [[3 Royal Canadian Regiment|3rd Battalion]] Pipes and Drums were redesignated the Special Service Force Pipes and Drums.\n\nThe 2nd Battalion The Royal Canadian Regiment currently maintains the only Pipes and Drums in the Canadian regular army.

The RCR Band, in contrast, was a professional brass and reed band manned by military musicians. The band in its final state was formed in [[London, Ontario|London]] in the 1950s, transferred to [[CFB Gagetown]] in the 1970s and disbanded in the 1990s. In its earlier forms, it was guided by the ''Standing Orders of The Royal Canadian Regiment'' of 1935, which constituted its activities.<ref>http://regimentalrogue.com/srsub/1935_The_RCR_Standing_Orders_07_band.html</ref> A notable member of the band is [[Jean-Pierre Montminy]], an officer who has served in [[La Musique du Royal 22e R\u00e9giment]] as well as at the [[Canadian Forces School of Music]].\n\n===Directors<ref>http://thercr.ca/CMFiles/2017_Regimental-Standing_Orders.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwiqmLzCrN7mAhVNZM0KHQ6-DwcQFjAMegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw3I4YPJdiwvYJJNA0ul63Th</ref>===\n\n*'''Bugle Band''':\n{{col div}}\n**[[Warrant officer|WO1]] G.

Without prior music training, he enrolled in the [[Gnessin State Musical College|Gnessin Musical Institute]], subsequently studying at the [[Moscow Conservatory]] in the class of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]], among others. His first major work, the [[Piano Concerto (Khachaturian)|Piano Concerto]] (1936), popularized his name within and outside the Soviet Union. It was followed by the [[Violin Concerto (Khachaturian)|Violin Concerto]] (1940) and the [[Cello Concerto (Khachaturian)|Cello Concerto]] (1946). His other significant compositions include the ''[[Masquerade (Khachaturian)|Masquerade Suite]]'' (1941), the [[Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Anthem of the Armenian SSR]] (1944), three symphonies (1935, 1943, [[Symphony No. 3 (Khachaturian)|1947]]), and around 25 film scores. Khachaturian is best known for his ballet music\u2014''[[Gayane (ballet)|Gayane]]'' (1942) and ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'' (1954). His most popular piece, the \"[[Sabre Dance]]\"  from ''Gayane'', has been used extensively in popular culture and has been covered by a number of musicians worldwide.<ref name=\"npr\"/> His style is \"characterized by colorful harmonies, captivating rhythms, virtuosity, improvisations, and sensuous melodies\".{{sfn|Bakst|1977|p=339}}\n\nDuring most of his career, Khachaturian was approved by the Soviet government and held several high posts in the [[Union of Soviet Composers]] from the late 1930s, although he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] only in 1943. Along with [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], he was officially denounced as a \"formalist\" and his music dubbed \"anti-people\" in 1948 but was restored later that year. After 1950 he taught at the Gnessin Institute and the Moscow Conservatory and turned to conducting. He traveled to Europe, Latin America and the United States with concerts of his own works. In 1957 Khachaturian became the Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers, a position he held until his death.\n\nKhachaturian composed the first Armenian [[ballet music]], symphony, concerto, and film score.{{efn-ua|{{lang|hy|\"\u0546\u0561 \u0561\u0566\u0563\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576 \u0561\u057c\u0561\u057b\u056b\u0576 \u0562\u0561\u056c\u0565\u057f\u056b, \u057d\u056b\u0574\u0586\u0578\u0576\u056b\u0561\u0575\u056b, \u0563\u0578\u0580\u056e\u056b\u0584\u0561\u0575\u056b\u0576 \u056f\u0578\u0576\u0581\u0565\u0580\u057f\u0576\u0565\u0580\u056b \u0570\u0565\u0572\u056b\u0576\u0561\u056f\u0576 \u0567, \u0570\u0561\u0575\u056f. \u056f\u056b\u0576\u0578\u0565\u0580\u0561\u056a\u0577\u057f\u0578\u0582\u0569\u0575\u0561\u0576 \u0570\u056b\u0574\u0576\u0561\u0564\u056b\u0580\u0568:\"}} He is the author of the first national ballet, symphony, concerto, first Arm. film score.{{sfn|Geodakyan|1979|p=19}}<br />{{lang|ru|\"\u0412 1939 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0443 \u0410\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0425\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u044f\u043d \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438\u043b \u043c\u0443\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0443 \u043a \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0430\u0440\u043c\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0431\u0430\u043b\u0435\u0442\u0443 \u00ab\u0421\u0447\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044c\u0435\u00bb.\"}} In 1939 Aram Khachaturian wrote the music to the first Armenian ballet ''Happiness''.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u0413\u0430\u044f\u043d\u044d |trans-title=Gayane |url=http://www.mariinsky.ru/ru/playbill/playbill/2014/7/22/1_1930/ |publisher=[[Mariinsky Theatre]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140817055900/http://www.mariinsky.ru/ru/playbill/playbill/2014/7/22/1_1930/ |archivedate=17 August 2014 |language=ru |date=22 July 2014 }}</ref>}} He is considered the most renowned Armenian composer of the 20th century.

Without prior music training, he enrolled in the [[Gnessin State Musical College|Gnessin Musical Institute]], subsequently studying at the [[Moscow Conservatory]] in the class of [[Nikolai Myaskovsky]], among others. His first major work, the [[Piano Concerto (Khachaturian)|Piano Concerto]] (1936), popularized his name within and outside the Soviet Union. It was followed by the [[Violin Concerto (Khachaturian)|Violin Concerto]] (1940) and the [[Cello Concerto (Khachaturian)|Cello Concerto]] (1946). His other significant compositions include the ''[[Masquerade (Khachaturian)|Masquerade Suite]]'' (1941), the [[Anthem of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Anthem of the Armenian SSR]] (1944), three symphonies (1935, 1943, [[Symphony No. 3 (Khachaturian)|1947]]), and around 25 film scores. Khachaturian is best known for his ballet music\u2014''[[Gayane (ballet)|Gayane]]'' (1942) and ''[[Spartacus (ballet)|Spartacus]]'' (1954). His most popular piece, the \"[[Sabre Dance]]\"  from ''Gayane'', has been used extensively in popular culture and has been covered by a number of musicians worldwide.<ref name=\"npr\"/> His style is \"characterized by colorful harmonies, captivating rhythms, virtuosity, improvisations, and sensuous melodies\".{{sfn|Bakst|1977|p=339}}\n\nDuring most of his career, Khachaturian was approved by the Soviet government and held several high posts in the [[Union of Soviet Composers]] from the late 1930s, although he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] only in 1943. Along with [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], he was officially denounced as a \"formalist\" and his music dubbed \"anti-people\" in 1948 but was restored later that year. After 1950 he taught at the Gnessin Institute and the Moscow Conservatory and turned to conducting. He traveled to Europe, Latin America and the United States with concerts of his own works.

The discipline applies to all animal eyes, whether human or not, since the practice and procedures are quite similar with respect to disease processes, while differences in anatomy or disease prevalence, whether subtle or substantial, may differentiate the two.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\n==History==\n===Ancient near east and the Greek period===\nIn the [[Ebers Papyrus]] from ancient Egypt dating to 1550 BC, a section is devoted to eye diseases.<ref name=\"mrcophth\" />\n\nThe pre-[[Hippocrates|Hippocratics]] largely based their anatomical conceptions of the eye on speculation, rather than [[empiricism]].<ref name=\"mrcophth\" /> They recognized the sclera and transparent cornea running flushly as the outer coating of the eye, with an inner layer with pupil, and a fluid at the centre. It was believed, by [[Alcamaeon]] (5th century BC) and others, that this fluid was the medium of vision and flowed from the eye to the brain by a tube. [[Aristotle]] advanced such ideas with empiricism. He dissected the eyes of animals, and discovering three layers (not two), found that the fluid was of a constant consistency with the lens forming (or congealing) after death, and the surrounding layers were seen to be juxtaposed. He and his contemporaries further put forth the existence of three tubes leading from the eye, not one. One tube from each eye met within the skull.\n\nThe Greek physician [[Rufus of Ephesus]] (1st century AD) recognised a more modern eye, with [[conjunctiva]], extending as a fourth epithelial layer over the eye.<ref name=\"mrcophth\" /> Rufus was the first to recognise a two-chambered eye, with one chamber from cornea to lens (filled with water), the other from lens to retina (filled with an egg white-like substance).\n\n[[Celsus]] the Greek philosopher of the 2nd century AD gave a detailed description of cataract surgery by the [[Couching (ophthalmology)|couching]] method.\n\nThe Greek physician [[Galen]] (2nd century AD) remedied some mistakes including the curvature of the cornea and lens, the nature of the optic nerve, and the existence of a [[posterior chamber of eyeball|posterior chamber]]. Though this model was a roughly correct modern model of the eye, it contained errors. Still, it was not advanced upon again until after [[Vesalius]]. A [[ciliary body]] was then discovered and the sclera, retina, choroid, and cornea were seen to meet at the same point. The two chambers were seen to hold the same fluid, as well as the lens being attached to the choroid. Galen continued the notion of a central canal, but he dissected the optic nerve and saw that it was solid. He mistakenly counted seven optical muscles, one too many. He also knew of the [[tear duct]]s.\n\n===Ancient India===\nThe Indian surgeon [[Sushruta]] wrote ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' in [[Sanskrit]] in about 6th century <small>CE</small><ref>{{cite book|last1=Boslaugh|first1=Sarah|title=Encyclopedia of epidemiology|date=2007|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1412928168|page=547}}</ref> which describes 76 ocular diseases (of these 51 surgical) as well as several ophthalmological surgical instruments and techniques.<ref>Bidyadhar, N.K.

Ophthalmology training equips eye specialists to provide the full spectrum of eye care, including the prescription of glasses and contact lenses, medical treatment, and complex microsurgery. In many countries, ophthalmologists also undergo additional specialized training in one of the many subspecialties. Ophthalmology was the first branch of medicine to offer [[board certification]], now a standard practice among all specialties.\n\n===Australia and New Zealand===\n{{See also|Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists}}\nIn [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the FRACO/FRANZCO is the equivalent postgraduate specialist qualification. The structured training system takes place over five years of postgraduate training. Overseas-trained ophthalmologists are assessed using the pathway published on the RANZCO website. Those who have completed their formal training in the UK and have the CCST/CCT are usually deemed to be comparable.\n\n===Bangladesh===\nIn [[Bangladesh]] to be an ophthalmologist the basic degree is an MBBS. Then they have to obtain a postgraduate degree or diploma in specialty ophthalmology. In Bangladesh, these are Diploma in Ophthalmology, Diploma in Community Ophthalmology, Fellow or Member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in ophthalmology, and Master of Science in ophthalmology.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]], an ophthalmology residency after medical school is undertaken. The residency lasts a minimum of five years after the MD degree which culminates in fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada (FRCSC). Subspecialty training is undertaken by about 30% of fellows (FRCSC) in a variety of fields from [[anterior segment]], [[cornea]], [[glaucoma]], [[vision rehabilitation]], [[uveitis]], [[oculoplastics]], medical and surgical retina, [[ocular oncology]], [[Pathology|Ocular pathology]], or [[neuro-ophthalmology]]. About 35 vacancies open per year for ophthalmology residency training in all of Canada. These numbers fluctuate per year, ranging from 30 to 37 spots. Of these, up to ten spots are at French-speaking universities in Quebec. At the end of the five years, the graduating ophthalmologist must pass the oral and written portions of the [[Royal College]] exam in either English or French.\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], physicians willing to become ophthalmologists must undergo a five-year specialization which includes practical training and theoretical studies.\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], after completing MBBS degree, postgraduate study in ophthalmology is required. The degrees are Doctor of Medicine, Master of Surgery, Diploma in Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery, and Diplomate of National Board. The concurrent training and work experience is in the form of a junior residency at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution under the supervision of experienced faculty. Further work experience in form of fellowship, registrar, or senior resident refines the skills of these eye surgeons. All India Ophthalmologist Society and various state-level ophthalmologist societies hold regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.\n\n===Nepal===\nIn [[Nepal]],  to become an ophthalmologist, three years postgraduate study is required after completing MBBS degree. The postgraduate degree in ophthalmology is called MD in Ophthalmology.  This degree is currently provided by Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, Tilganga, Kathmandu, BPKLCO, Institute of Medicine, TU, Kathmandu, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel and National Academy of Medical Science, Kathmandu. Few Nepalese citizen also study this subject in Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and other countries. All the graduates have to pass Nepal Medical Council Licensing Exam to become a registered Ophthalmology in Nepal. The concurrent residency training is in the form of a PG student (resident) at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution according to the degree providing university's rules and regulations. Nepal Ophthalmic Society holds regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.\n\n===Ireland===\n{{See also|Irish College of Ophthalmologists}}\nIn [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland]] grants Membership (MRCSI (Ophth)) and Fellowship (FRCSI (Ophth)) qualifications in conjunction with the Irish College of Ophthalmologists. Total postgraduate training involves an intern year, a minimum of three years of basic surgical training and a further 4.5 years of higher surgical training. Clinical training takes place within public, [[Health Service Executive]]-funded hospitals in [[Dublin]], [[Sligo]], [[Limerick]], [[Galway]], [[Waterford]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. A minimum of 8.5 years of training is required before eligibility to work in [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]] posts. Some trainees take extra time to obtain [[MSc]], [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|MD]] or [[PhD]] degrees and to undertake clinical fellowships in the UK, Australia and the United States.\n\n===Pakistan===\nIn [[Pakistan]], after MBBS, a four-year full-time residency program leads to an exit-level FCPS examination in ophthalmology, held under the auspices of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Pakistan. The tough examination is assessed by both highly qualified Pakistani and eminent international ophthalmic consultants. As a prerequisite to the final examinations, an intermediate module, an optics and refraction module, and a dissertation written on a research project carried out under supervision is also assessed.\nMoreover, a two-and-a-half-year residency program leads to an MCPS while a two-year training of DOMS is also being offered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cpsp.edu.pk |title=College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan |publisher=Cpsp.edu.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref> For candidates in the military, a stringent two-year graded course, with quarterly assessments, is held under Armed Forces Post Graduate Medical Institute in Rawalpindi.\nThe M.S. in ophthalmology is also one of the specialty programs. In addition to programs for doctors, various diplomas and degrees for allied eyecare personnel are also being offered to produce competent optometrists, orthoptists, ophthalmic nurses, ophthalmic technologists, and ophthalmic technicians in this field. These programs are being offered notably by the [[College of Ophthalmology and Allied Vision Sciences]] in [[Lahore]] and the Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology in Peshawar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kemu.edu.pk/pipo.html |title=King Edward Medical University |publisher=Kemu.edu.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref> Subspecialty fellowships are also being offered in the fields of [[pediatric ophthalmology]] and vitreoretinal ophthalmology. [[King Edward Medical University]], Al Shifa Trust Eye Hospital Rawalpindi, and Al- Ibrahim Eye Hospital Karachi have also started a degree program in this field.\n\n===Philippines===\nOphthalmology is a considered a medical specialty that uses medicine and surgery to treat diseases of the eye. There is only one, duly recognized by the PMA and the PCS, professional organization in the country: the Philippine Academy of Ophthalmology (PAO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pao.org.ph |title= Philippine Academy of Ophthalmology |work=PAO.org.ph |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref> PAO and the state-standard Philippine Board of Ophthalmology (PBO) regulates ophthalmology residency programs and board certification. To become a general ophthalmologist in the Philippines, a candidate must have completed a Doctor of Medicine degree (MD) or its equivalent (e.g. MBBS), have completed an internship in Medicine, have passed the physician licensure exam, and completed residency training at a hospital accredited by the Philippine Board of Ophthalmology (accrediting arm of PAO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pao.org.ph/pbo.php |title=PBO Officers |website=PAO.org.ph |date=2012-12-01 |accessdate=2013-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302111113/http://pao.org.ph/pbo.php |archive-date=2013-03-02}}</ref> Attainment of board certification in ophthalmology from the PBO is essential in acquiring privileges in most major health institutions. Graduates of residency programs can receive further training in ophthalmology subspecialties, such as neuro-ophthalmology, retina, etc. by completing a fellowship program which varies in length depending on each program's requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], three colleges grant postgraduate degrees in ophthalmology. The [[Royal College of Ophthalmologists]] (RCOphth) and the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] grant MRCOphth/FRCOphth and MRCSEd/FRCSEd, (although membership is no longer a prerequisite for fellowship), the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow|Royal College]] of Glasgow grants FRCS. Postgraduate work as a [[specialist registrar]] and one of these degrees is required for specialization in [[eye disease]]s. Such clinical work is within the NHS, with supplementary private work for some consultants.\nOnly 2.3 ophthalmologists exist per 100,000 population in the UK \u2013 fewer ''pro rata'' than in any other nation in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uems.net |title=European Union of medical specialists |publisher=Uems.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|Medical education in the United States}}\nIn the [[United States]], ophthalmologists must complete four years of undergraduate studies, four years of medical school, one year medical or general surgical residency, three years of ophthalmology residency and optional one to two years of speciality training. Ophthalmologists are Doctors of Medicine that specialize in the eye and related structures. They perform medical and surgical eye care and can also write prescriptions for corrective lenses (glasses and contacts). They often deal with advanced forms of eye disease in patients with significant systemic illness.\n\nPhysicians must complete the requirements of [[continuing medical education]] to maintain licensure and for recertification. Professional bodies like the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] and American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery organize conferences, help physician members through [[continuing medical education]] programs for maintaining [[board certification]], and provide political advocacy and peer support.\n\n==Notable ophthalmologists==\nThe following is a list of physicians who have significantly contributed to the field of ophthalmology:\n\n===18th\u201319th centuries===\n[[Image:Albrecht v Graefe3.jpg|thumb|160px|Albrecht von Graefe]]\n* [[Theodor Leber]] discovered Leber's congenital amaurosis, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, Leber's miliary aneurysm, and Leber's stellate neuroretinitis.\n* [[Carl Ferdinand von Arlt]] (1812\u20131887), the elder (Austrian), proved that myopia is largely due to an excessive axial length, published influential textbooks on eye disease, and ran annual eye clinics in needy areas long before the concept of volunteer eye camps became popular. His name is still attached to some disease signs, e.g., von [[Arlt's line]] in trachoma. His son Ferdinand Ritter von Arlt, the younger, was also an ophthalmologist.\n* [[Jacques Daviel]] (France) claimed to be the founder of modern [[cataract]] surgery in that he performed cataract extraction instead of needling the cataract or pushing it back into the vitreous. He is said to have carried out the technique on 206 patients in 1752\u201353, of which 182 were reported to be successful. These figures are not very credible, given the total lack of both anaesthesia and aseptic technique at that time.\n* [[Franciscus Donders]] (1818\u20131889) (Dutch) published pioneering analyses of [[ocular biomechanics]], intraocular pressure, [[glaucoma]], and physiological [[optics]]. He made possible the prescribing of combinations of spherical and cylindrical lenses to treat [[astigmatism]].\n* [[Joseph Forlenze]] (1757\u20131833) (Italy), specialist in [[cataract surgery]], became popular during the [[First French Empire]], healing, among many, personalities such as the minister [[Jean-\u00c9tienne-Marie Portalis]] and the poet [[Ponce Denis \u00c9couchard Lebrun|Ponce Denis Lebrun]]. He was nominated by [[Napoleon]] \"chirurgien oculiste of the lycees, the civil hospices and all the charitable institutions of the departments of the Empire\".<ref>[[Jan E.

He was a brilliant clinician and charismatic teacher who had an international influence on the development of ophthalmology, and was a pioneer in mapping visual field defects and diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. He introduced a cataract extraction technique that remained the standard for over 100 years, and many other important surgical techniques such as iridectomy. He rationalised the use of many ophthalmically important drugs, including mydriatics and miotics. He also was the founder of one of the earliest ophthalmic societies (German Ophthalmological Society, 1857) and one of the earliest ophthalmic journals (''Graefe's Archives of Ophthalmology''). He was probably the most important ophthalmologist of the 19th century.\n* [[Allvar Gullstrand]] (Sweden) was a [[Nobel Prize]]-winner in 1911 for his research on the eye as a light-refracting apparatus. He described the 'schematic eye', a mathematical model of the [[human eye]] based on his measurements known as the 'optical constants' of the eye. His measurements are still used today.\n* [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], a great German [[polymath]], invented the ophthalmoscope (1851) and published important work on physiological optics, including colour vision (1850s).\n* [[Julius Hirschberg]] (Germany) in 1879 became the first to use an [[electromagnet]] to remove metallic [[foreign body|foreign bodies]] from the [[human eye|eye]] and in 1886 developed the [[Hirschberg test]] for measuring [[strabismus]].\n* [[Peter Adolph Gad]] (1846 \u2013 1907), Danish ophthalmologist who founded the first eye infirmary in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\n* [[Polara family|Socrate Polara]] (1800\u20131860, Italy) founded the first dedicated ophthalmology clinic in Sicily in 1829, entirely as a philanthropic endeavor; later he was appointed as the first director of the ophthalmology department at the Grand Hospital of Palermo, Sicily, in 1831 after the Sicilian government became convinced of the importance of state support for the specialization.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parisi|first=Antonino|title=Annuario Storico del Regno della Due Sicilie, dal Principio del Governo, di Ferdinando II Borbone|year=1838|publisher=Tipografica Trani (Napoli)|pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n* [[Herman Snellen]] (Netherlands) introduced the [[Snellen chart]] to study [[visual acuity]].\n\n===20th\u201321st centuries===\n* [[Volodymyr Filatov|Vladimir Petrovich Filatov]] (1875\u20131956) (Ukraine) contributed the tube flap grafting method, corneal transplantation, and preservation of grafts from cadaver eyes and tissue therapy.

It was believed, by [[Alcamaeon]] (5th century BC) and others, that this fluid was the medium of vision and flowed from the eye to the brain by a tube. [[Aristotle]] advanced such ideas with empiricism. He dissected the eyes of animals, and discovering three layers (not two), found that the fluid was of a constant consistency with the lens forming (or congealing) after death, and the surrounding layers were seen to be juxtaposed. He and his contemporaries further put forth the existence of three tubes leading from the eye, not one. One tube from each eye met within the skull.\n\nThe Greek physician [[Rufus of Ephesus]] (1st century AD) recognised a more modern eye, with [[conjunctiva]], extending as a fourth epithelial layer over the eye.<ref name=\"mrcophth\" /> Rufus was the first to recognise a two-chambered eye, with one chamber from cornea to lens (filled with water), the other from lens to retina (filled with an egg white-like substance).\n\n[[Celsus]] the Greek philosopher of the 2nd century AD gave a detailed description of cataract surgery by the [[Couching (ophthalmology)|couching]] method.\n\nThe Greek physician [[Galen]] (2nd century AD) remedied some mistakes including the curvature of the cornea and lens, the nature of the optic nerve, and the existence of a [[posterior chamber of eyeball|posterior chamber]]. Though this model was a roughly correct modern model of the eye, it contained errors. Still, it was not advanced upon again until after [[Vesalius]]. A [[ciliary body]] was then discovered and the sclera, retina, choroid, and cornea were seen to meet at the same point. The two chambers were seen to hold the same fluid, as well as the lens being attached to the choroid. Galen continued the notion of a central canal, but he dissected the optic nerve and saw that it was solid. He mistakenly counted seven optical muscles, one too many. He also knew of the [[tear duct]]s.\n\n===Ancient India===\nThe Indian surgeon [[Sushruta]] wrote ''[[Sushruta Samhita]]'' in [[Sanskrit]] in about 6th century <small>CE</small><ref>{{cite book|last1=Boslaugh|first1=Sarah|title=Encyclopedia of epidemiology|date=2007|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1412928168|page=547}}</ref> which describes 76 ocular diseases (of these 51 surgical) as well as several ophthalmological surgical instruments and techniques.<ref>Bidyadhar, N.K.

Ophthalmology training equips eye specialists to provide the full spectrum of eye care, including the prescription of glasses and contact lenses, medical treatment, and complex microsurgery. In many countries, ophthalmologists also undergo additional specialized training in one of the many subspecialties. Ophthalmology was the first branch of medicine to offer [[board certification]], now a standard practice among all specialties.\n\n===Australia and New Zealand===\n{{See also|Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists}}\nIn [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], the FRACO/FRANZCO is the equivalent postgraduate specialist qualification. The structured training system takes place over five years of postgraduate training. Overseas-trained ophthalmologists are assessed using the pathway published on the RANZCO website. Those who have completed their formal training in the UK and have the CCST/CCT are usually deemed to be comparable.\n\n===Bangladesh===\nIn [[Bangladesh]] to be an ophthalmologist the basic degree is an MBBS. Then they have to obtain a postgraduate degree or diploma in specialty ophthalmology. In Bangladesh, these are Diploma in Ophthalmology, Diploma in Community Ophthalmology, Fellow or Member of the College of Physicians and Surgeons in ophthalmology, and Master of Science in ophthalmology.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]], an ophthalmology residency after medical school is undertaken. The residency lasts a minimum of five years after the MD degree which culminates in fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons of Canada (FRCSC). Subspecialty training is undertaken by about 30% of fellows (FRCSC) in a variety of fields from [[anterior segment]], [[cornea]], [[glaucoma]], [[vision rehabilitation]], [[uveitis]], [[oculoplastics]], medical and surgical retina, [[ocular oncology]], [[Pathology|Ocular pathology]], or [[neuro-ophthalmology]]. About 35 vacancies open per year for ophthalmology residency training in all of Canada. These numbers fluctuate per year, ranging from 30 to 37 spots. Of these, up to ten spots are at French-speaking universities in Quebec. At the end of the five years, the graduating ophthalmologist must pass the oral and written portions of the [[Royal College]] exam in either English or French.\n\n===Finland===\nIn [[Finland]], physicians willing to become ophthalmologists must undergo a five-year specialization which includes practical training and theoretical studies.\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], after completing MBBS degree, postgraduate study in ophthalmology is required. The degrees are Doctor of Medicine, Master of Surgery, Diploma in Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery, and Diplomate of National Board. The concurrent training and work experience is in the form of a junior residency at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution under the supervision of experienced faculty. Further work experience in form of fellowship, registrar, or senior resident refines the skills of these eye surgeons. All India Ophthalmologist Society and various state-level ophthalmologist societies hold regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.\n\n===Nepal===\nIn [[Nepal]],  to become an ophthalmologist, three years postgraduate study is required after completing MBBS degree. The postgraduate degree in ophthalmology is called MD in Ophthalmology.  This degree is currently provided by Tilganga Institute of Ophthalmology, Tilganga, Kathmandu, BPKLCO, Institute of Medicine, TU, Kathmandu, BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Kathmandu University, Dhulikhel and National Academy of Medical Science, Kathmandu. Few Nepalese citizen also study this subject in Bangladesh, China, India, Pakistan and other countries. All the graduates have to pass Nepal Medical Council Licensing Exam to become a registered Ophthalmology in Nepal. The concurrent residency training is in the form of a PG student (resident) at a medical college, eye hospital, or institution according to the degree providing university's rules and regulations. Nepal Ophthalmic Society holds regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.\n\n===Ireland===\n{{See also|Irish College of Ophthalmologists}}\nIn [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Ireland]] grants Membership (MRCSI (Ophth)) and Fellowship (FRCSI (Ophth)) qualifications in conjunction with the Irish College of Ophthalmologists. Total postgraduate training involves an intern year, a minimum of three years of basic surgical training and a further 4.5 years of higher surgical training. Clinical training takes place within public, [[Health Service Executive]]-funded hospitals in [[Dublin]], [[Sligo]], [[Limerick]], [[Galway]], [[Waterford]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. A minimum of 8.5 years of training is required before eligibility to work in [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]] posts. Some trainees take extra time to obtain [[MSc]], [[Doctor of Medicine#UK, Ireland and some Commonwealth countries|MD]] or [[PhD]] degrees and to undertake clinical fellowships in the UK, Australia and the United States.\n\n===Pakistan===\nIn [[Pakistan]], after MBBS, a four-year full-time residency program leads to an exit-level FCPS examination in ophthalmology, held under the auspices of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, Pakistan. The tough examination is assessed by both highly qualified Pakistani and eminent international ophthalmic consultants. As a prerequisite to the final examinations, an intermediate module, an optics and refraction module, and a dissertation written on a research project carried out under supervision is also assessed.\nMoreover, a two-and-a-half-year residency program leads to an MCPS while a two-year training of DOMS is also being offered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cpsp.edu.pk |title=College of Physicians and Surgeons Pakistan |publisher=Cpsp.edu.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref> For candidates in the military, a stringent two-year graded course, with quarterly assessments, is held under Armed Forces Post Graduate Medical Institute in Rawalpindi.\nThe M.S. in ophthalmology is also one of the specialty programs. In addition to programs for doctors, various diplomas and degrees for allied eyecare personnel are also being offered to produce competent optometrists, orthoptists, ophthalmic nurses, ophthalmic technologists, and ophthalmic technicians in this field. These programs are being offered notably by the [[College of Ophthalmology and Allied Vision Sciences]] in [[Lahore]] and the Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology in Peshawar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kemu.edu.pk/pipo.html |title=King Edward Medical University |publisher=Kemu.edu.pk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}</ref> Subspecialty fellowships are also being offered in the fields of [[pediatric ophthalmology]] and vitreoretinal ophthalmology.

To become a general ophthalmologist in the Philippines, a candidate must have completed a Doctor of Medicine degree (MD) or its equivalent (e.g. MBBS), have completed an internship in Medicine, have passed the physician licensure exam, and completed residency training at a hospital accredited by the Philippine Board of Ophthalmology (accrediting arm of PAO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pao.org.ph/pbo.php |title=PBO Officers |website=PAO.org.ph |date=2012-12-01 |accessdate=2013-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302111113/http://pao.org.ph/pbo.php |archive-date=2013-03-02}}</ref> Attainment of board certification in ophthalmology from the PBO is essential in acquiring privileges in most major health institutions. Graduates of residency programs can receive further training in ophthalmology subspecialties, such as neuro-ophthalmology, retina, etc. by completing a fellowship program which varies in length depending on each program's requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], three colleges grant postgraduate degrees in ophthalmology. The [[Royal College of Ophthalmologists]] (RCOphth) and the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]] grant MRCOphth/FRCOphth and MRCSEd/FRCSEd, (although membership is no longer a prerequisite for fellowship), the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow|Royal College]] of Glasgow grants FRCS. Postgraduate work as a [[specialist registrar]] and one of these degrees is required for specialization in [[eye disease]]s. Such clinical work is within the NHS, with supplementary private work for some consultants.\nOnly 2.3 ophthalmologists exist per 100,000 population in the UK \u2013 fewer ''pro rata'' than in any other nation in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uems.net |title=European Union of medical specialists |publisher=Uems.net |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|Medical education in the United States}}\nIn the [[United States]], ophthalmologists must complete four years of undergraduate studies, four years of medical school, one year medical or general surgical residency, three years of ophthalmology residency and optional one to two years of speciality training. Ophthalmologists are Doctors of Medicine that specialize in the eye and related structures. They perform medical and surgical eye care and can also write prescriptions for corrective lenses (glasses and contacts). They often deal with advanced forms of eye disease in patients with significant systemic illness.\n\nPhysicians must complete the requirements of [[continuing medical education]] to maintain licensure and for recertification. Professional bodies like the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] and American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery organize conferences, help physician members through [[continuing medical education]] programs for maintaining [[board certification]], and provide political advocacy and peer support.\n\n==Notable ophthalmologists==\nThe following is a list of physicians who have significantly contributed to the field of ophthalmology:\n\n===18th\u201319th centuries===\n[[Image:Albrecht v Graefe3.jpg|thumb|160px|Albrecht von Graefe]]\n* [[Theodor Leber]] discovered Leber's congenital amaurosis, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, Leber's miliary aneurysm, and Leber's stellate neuroretinitis.\n* [[Carl Ferdinand von Arlt]] (1812\u20131887), the elder (Austrian), proved that myopia is largely due to an excessive axial length, published influential textbooks on eye disease, and ran annual eye clinics in needy areas long before the concept of volunteer eye camps became popular. His name is still attached to some disease signs, e.g., von [[Arlt's line]] in trachoma. His son Ferdinand Ritter von Arlt, the younger, was also an ophthalmologist.\n* [[Jacques Daviel]] (France) claimed to be the founder of modern [[cataract]] surgery in that he performed cataract extraction instead of needling the cataract or pushing it back into the vitreous. He is said to have carried out the technique on 206 patients in 1752\u201353, of which 182 were reported to be successful. These figures are not very credible, given the total lack of both anaesthesia and aseptic technique at that time.\n* [[Franciscus Donders]] (1818\u20131889) (Dutch) published pioneering analyses of [[ocular biomechanics]], intraocular pressure, [[glaucoma]], and physiological [[optics]]. He made possible the prescribing of combinations of spherical and cylindrical lenses to treat [[astigmatism]].\n* [[Joseph Forlenze]] (1757\u20131833) (Italy), specialist in [[cataract surgery]], became popular during the [[First French Empire]], healing, among many, personalities such as the minister [[Jean-\u00c9tienne-Marie Portalis]] and the poet [[Ponce Denis \u00c9couchard Lebrun|Ponce Denis Lebrun]]. He was nominated by [[Napoleon]] \"chirurgien oculiste of the lycees, the civil hospices and all the charitable institutions of the departments of the Empire\".<ref>[[Jan E.

He was a brilliant clinician and charismatic teacher who had an international influence on the development of ophthalmology, and was a pioneer in mapping visual field defects and diagnosis and treatment of glaucoma. He introduced a cataract extraction technique that remained the standard for over 100 years, and many other important surgical techniques such as iridectomy. He rationalised the use of many ophthalmically important drugs, including mydriatics and miotics. He also was the founder of one of the earliest ophthalmic societies (German Ophthalmological Society, 1857) and one of the earliest ophthalmic journals (''Graefe's Archives of Ophthalmology''). He was probably the most important ophthalmologist of the 19th century.\n* [[Allvar Gullstrand]] (Sweden) was a [[Nobel Prize]]-winner in 1911 for his research on the eye as a light-refracting apparatus. He described the 'schematic eye', a mathematical model of the [[human eye]] based on his measurements known as the 'optical constants' of the eye. His measurements are still used today.\n* [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], a great German [[polymath]], invented the ophthalmoscope (1851) and published important work on physiological optics, including colour vision (1850s).\n* [[Julius Hirschberg]] (Germany) in 1879 became the first to use an [[electromagnet]] to remove metallic [[foreign body|foreign bodies]] from the [[human eye|eye]] and in 1886 developed the [[Hirschberg test]] for measuring [[strabismus]].\n* [[Peter Adolph Gad]] (1846 \u2013 1907), Danish ophthalmologist who founded the first eye infirmary in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\n* [[Polara family|Socrate Polara]] (1800\u20131860, Italy) founded the first dedicated ophthalmology clinic in Sicily in 1829, entirely as a philanthropic endeavor; later he was appointed as the first director of the ophthalmology department at the Grand Hospital of Palermo, Sicily, in 1831 after the Sicilian government became convinced of the importance of state support for the specialization.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parisi|first=Antonino|title=Annuario Storico del Regno della Due Sicilie, dal Principio del Governo, di Ferdinando II Borbone|year=1838|publisher=Tipografica Trani (Napoli)|pages=66\u201367}}</ref>\n* [[Herman Snellen]] (Netherlands) introduced the [[Snellen chart]] to study [[visual acuity]].\n\n===20th\u201321st centuries===\n* [[Volodymyr Filatov|Vladimir Petrovich Filatov]] (1875\u20131956) (Ukraine) contributed the tube flap grafting method, corneal transplantation, and preservation of grafts from cadaver eyes and tissue therapy.

{"title_page": "Dovetail joint", "text_new": "{{other uses|Dovetail (disambiguation)}}\n[[File:Finished dovetail.jpg|thumb|A finished dovetail joint]]\n[[File:Gersa18.jpg|thumb|200px|Dovetailed woodworking joints on a Romanian church]]\n[[File:Perumthachan Pillar\u0d35\u0d3e\u0d34\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d33\u0d4d\u0d33\u0d3f.jpg|thumb|Stone pillar at the [[Vazhappally Maha Siva Temple]]]]\nA '''dovetail joint''' or simply '''dovetail''' is a [[Woodworking joints|joinery]] technique most commonly used in woodworking joinery (carpentry), including furniture, cabinets,<ref>[http://www.finewoodworking.com/how-to/article/carcase-construction.aspx carcase construction]</ref> [[log building]]s, and traditional [[timber framing]]. Noted for its resistance to being pulled apart ([[tensile strength]]), the dovetail joint is commonly used to join the sides of a drawer to the front.\nA series of 'pins' cut to extend from the end of one board interlock with a series of 'tails' cut into the end of another board. The pins and tails have a trapezoidal shape. Once glued, a wooden dovetail joint requires no mechanical fasteners.\n\nThe dovetail joint technique probably pre-dates written history. Some of the earliest known examples of the dovetail joint are in ancient Egyptian furniture entombed with mummies dating from First Dynasty, the tombs of Chinese emperors, and a stone pillar at the [[Vazhappally Maha Siva Temple]] in India. The dovetail design is an important method of distinguishing various periods of furniture.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn Europe, the dovetail joint is sometimes called a '''swallowtail''' joint, a '''culvertail''' joint (''{{linktext|culver}}'' also means \u2018dove\u2019), or a '''fantail''' joint.<ref>{{cite book |date=1994 |title=Routledge French technical dictionary |url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780203014257/ |volume=1 |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415112253 }}</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThe dovetail joint is very strong because of the way the 'tails' and 'pins' are shaped.  This makes it difficult to pull the joint apart and virtually impossible when glue is added.  This type of joint is used in box constructions such as drawers, jewellery boxes, cabinets and other pieces of furniture where strength is required.  It is a difficult joint to make manually, requiring skilled workmanship.  There are different types of dovetail joints.  \n\nThe angle of slope varies according to the wood used, purpose of joint and type of work. Typically the slope is 1:6 for [[softwood]]s, and a shallower 1:8 slope for [[hardwood]]s. Often a slope of 1:7 is used as a compromise. However, a different slope does not affect the strength of the joint in different types of wood.<ref>{{cite book |date=1958 |title=The relationship between dovetail angle and joint strength |url=http://www.akeda.com/documents/DovetailAngle.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Types of dovetails==\n===Through dovetail===\n[[Image:joinery-throughdovetail.svg|thumb|200px|right|A through dovetail joint]]\nThe image at the top of this page shows a 'through dovetail' (also known as 'plain dovetail') joint, where the end grain of both boards is visible when the joint is assembled.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/joints/case/dovetail |title=Dovetail Case Joints |website=Woodwork Details |access-date=February 6, 2015 }}</ref> Through dovetails are common in carcass and box construction. Traditionally, the dovetails would have often been covered by a veneer. However, dovetails have become a signature of craftsmanship and are generally considered a feature, so they are rarely concealed in contemporary work. When used in drawer construction, a through (or blind, [[Miter joint|mitred]], or lapped) dovetail joint is sometimes referred to as an \"English dovetail.\"<ref name=\"Furniche\">{{cite web|title=What's in Your Drawers|url=https://www.furniche.com/articles/whats-your-drawers|website=Furniche|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Half-blind dovetail===\n[[Image:joinery-halfblinddovetail.gif|thumb|200px|right|A half-blind dovetail joint]]\nCraftsmen use a 'half-blind dovetail' when they do not want the end grain visible from the front of the joint. The tails fit into mortises in the ends of the board that is the front of the item, hiding their ends.\n\nHalf-blind dovetails are commonly used to fasten drawer fronts to drawer sides. This is an alternative to the practice of attaching false fronts to drawers constructed using through dovetails.\n\n===Secret mitred dovetail===\n[[Image:Secret Mitred Dovetail.png|thumb|200px|right|A secret [[Miter joint|mitred]] dovetail joint]]\nThe 'secret [[Miter joint|mitred]] dovetail' joint (also called a 'mitred blind dovetail', 'full-blind dovetail', or 'full-blind mitred dovetail') is used in the highest class of cabinet and box work. It offers the strength found in the dovetail joint but is totally hidden from both outside faces by forming the outer edge to meet at a 45-degree angle while hiding the dovetails internally within the joint.\n\nThe mitred corner dovetail joint is very similar in design, but it has just a single dovetail and is used for picture frames and other similar joins.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.toolstoday.com/g-46-dovetail-joints-different-types-and-their-uses.aspx |title=Dovetail Joints: Different Types and Their Uses |website=ToolsToday |access-date=February 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Secret double-lapped dovetail===\nThe '''secret double-lapped dovetail''' is similar to the secret mitred dovetail, but presents a very thin section of end grain on one edge of the joint.

This joint provides the interlocking strength of a dovetail. Sliding dovetails are assembled by sliding the tail into the socket.  It is common to slightly taper the socket, making it slightly tighter towards the rear of the joint, so that the two components can be slid together easily but the joint becomes tighter as the finished position is reached.  Another method to implement a tapered sliding dovetail is to taper the tail instead of the socket.  When used in drawer construction, a \"stopped sliding dovetail\" that does not extend across the full width of the board is sometimes referred to as a \"French dovetail\".<ref name=\"Furniche\" />\n\nUsed for:\n* Joining shelves to cabinet sides\n* Joining cabinet bottoms to sides\n* Joining horizontal partitions to shelves\n* Joining adjacent sections of expandable table frames\n* Joining drawer fronts to sides\n* Joining front rails of [[web frame]]s to cabinet sides\n* Joining neck and body in violins and some guitars.\n\n== Non-woodworking dovetails ==\n[[Image:Ironbridge2.jpg|thumb|[[Cast iron]] dovetail joints in the [[Iron Bridge]], Shropshire]]\nDovetails are most commonly, but not exclusively, used in woodworking.

Noted for its resistance to being pulled apart ([[tensile strength]]), the dovetail joint is commonly used to join the sides of a drawer to the front.\nA series of 'pins' cut to extend from the end of one board interlock with a series of 'tails' cut into the end of another board. The pins and tails have a trapezoidal shape. Once glued, a wooden dovetail joint requires no mechanical fasteners.\n\nThe Dovetail joint technique probably pre-dates written history. Some of the earliest known examples of the dovetail joint are in ancient Egyptian furniture entombed with mummies dating from First Dynasty, the tombs of Chinese emperors, and a stone pillar at the [[Vazhappally Maha Siva Temple]] in India. The dovetail design is an important method of distinguishing various periods of furniture.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn Europe the dovetail joint is sometimes called a '''swallowtail''' joint, a [[wikt:culver|culvertail]] joint,  or a fantail joint.<ref>{{cite book |date=1994 |title=Routledge French technical dictionary |url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780203014257/ |volume=1 |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415112253 }}</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThe dovetail joint is very strong because of the way the 'tails' and 'pins' are shaped.  This makes it difficult to pull the joint apart and virtually impossible when glue is added.  This type of joint is used in box constructions such as drawers, jewellery boxes, cabinets and other pieces of furniture where strength is required.  It is a difficult joint to make manually, requiring skilled workmanship.  There are different types of dovetail joints.  \n\nThe angle of slope varies according to the wood used, purpose of joint and type of work. Typically the slope is 1:6 for softwoods and a shallower 1:8 slope for hardwoods. Often a slope of 1:7 is used as a compromise. However, a different slope does not affect the strength of the joint in different types of wood.<ref>{{cite book |date=1958 |title=The relationship between dovetail angle and joint strength |url=http://www.akeda.com/documents/DovetailAngle.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Types of dovetails==\n===Through dovetail===\n[[Image:joinery-throughdovetail.svg|thumb|200px|right|A through dovetail joint]]\nThe image at the top of this page shows a 'through dovetail' (also known as 'plain dovetail') joint, where the end grain of both boards is visible when the joint is assembled.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/joints/case/dovetail |title=Dovetail Case Joints |website=Woodwork Details |access-date=February 6, 2015 }}</ref> Through dovetails are common in carcass and box construction. Traditionally, the dovetails would have often been covered by a veneer. However, dovetails have become a signature of craftsmanship and are generally considered a feature, so they are rarely concealed in contemporary work. When used in drawer construction, a through (or blind, [[Miter joint|mitred]], or lapped) dovetail joint is sometimes referred to as an \"English dovetail.\"<ref name=\"Furniche\">{{cite web|title=What's in Your Drawers|url=https://www.furniche.com/articles/whats-your-drawers|website=Furniche|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Half-blind dovetail===\n[[Image:joinery-halfblinddovetail.gif|thumb|200px|right|A half-blind dovetail joint]]\nCraftsmen use a 'half-blind dovetail' when they do not want the end grain visible from the front of the joint. The tails fit into mortises in the ends of the board that is the front of the item, hiding their ends.\n\nHalf-blind dovetails are commonly used to fasten drawer fronts to drawer sides. This is an alternative to the practice of attaching false fronts to drawers constructed using through dovetails.\n\n===Secret mitred dovetail===\n[[Image:Secret Mitred Dovetail.png|thumb|200px|right|A secret mitred dovetail joint]]\nThe 'secret [[Miter joint|mitred]] dovetail' joint (also called a 'mitred blind dovetail', 'full-blind dovetail', or 'full-blind mitred dovetail') is used in the highest class of cabinet and box work. It offers the strength found in the dovetail joint but is totally hidden from both outside faces by forming the outer edge to meet at a 45-degree angle while hiding the dovetails internally within the joint.\n\nThe mitred corner dovetail joint is very similar in design, but it has just a single dovetail and is used for picture frames and other similar joins.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.toolstoday.com/g-46-dovetail-joints-different-types-and-their-uses.aspx |title=Dovetail Joints: Different Types and Their Uses |website=ToolsToday |access-date=February 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Secret double-lapped dovetail===\nThe '''secret double-lapped dovetail''' is similar to the secret mitred dovetail, but presents a very thin section of end grain on one edge of the joint.

The [[Department of Health]] identifies three groups of people who may be classified as severely visually impaired.<ref name=\"dh.gov.uk\"/>\n#Those below 3/60 (equivalent to 20/400 in US notation) [[Snellen chart|Snellen]] (most people below 3/60 are severely sight impaired).\n#Those better than 3/60 but below 6/60 Snellen (people who have a very contracted field of vision only).\n#Those 6/60 Snellen or above (people in this group who have a contracted [[field of vision]] especially if the contraction is in the lower part of the field).\n\nThe Department of Health also state that a person is more likely to be classified as severely visually impaired if their eyesight has failed recently or if they are an older individual, both groups being perceived as less able to adapt to their vision loss.<ref name=\"dh.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, any person with vision that cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in the best eye, or who has 20 [[visual angle|degrees]] ([[angular diameter|diameter]]) or less of visual field remaining, is considered legally blind or eligible for disability classification and possible inclusion in certain government sponsored programs.\n\nIn the United States, the terms ''partially sighted'', ''low vision'', ''legally blind'' and ''totally blind'' are used by schools, colleges, and other educational institutions to describe students with visual impairments.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nichcy.org/ | title = National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911232205/http://www.nichcy.org/ | archive-date=2007-09-11 }}</ref> They are defined as follows:\n*''Partially sighted'' indicates some type of visual problem, with a need of person to receive special education in some cases.\n*''Low vision'' generally refers to a severe visual impairment, not necessarily limited to distance vision. Low vision applies to all individuals with sight who are unable to read the newspaper at a normal viewing distance, even with the aid of eyeglasses or contact lenses. They use a combination of vision and other senses to learn, although they may require adaptations in lighting or the size of print, and, sometimes, [[Braille]].\n**''[[Myopia|Myopic]]'' \u2013 unable to see distant objects clearly, commonly called near-sighted or short-sighted.\n**''[[Hyperopia|Hyperopic]]'' \u2013 unable to see close objects clearly, commonly called far-sighted or long-sighted.\n*''Legally blind'' indicates that a person has less than 20/200 vision in the better eye after best correction (contact lenses or glasses), or a field of vision of less than 20 degrees in the better eye.\n*''Totally blind'' students learn via Braille or other non-visual media.\n\nIn 1934, the [[American Medical Association]] adopted the following definition of blindness:\n<blockquote>Central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with corrective glasses or central visual acuity of more than 20/200 if there is a visual field defect in which the peripheral field is contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees in the better eye.<ref name=\"Koestler\">{{cite book | vauthors = Koestler FA | date = 1976 | title = The unseen minority: a social history of blindness in the United States. | location = New York | publisher = David McKay }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[United States Congress]] included this definition as part of the Aid to the Blind program in the [[Social Security (United States)#Creation: The Social Security Act|Social Security Act]] passed in 1935.<ref name=\"Koestler\"/><ref name=\"Corn\">{{cite web | vauthors = Corn AL, Spungin SJ | url = http://www.coe.ufl.edu/copsse/docs/IB-10/1/IB-10.pdf | title = Free and Appropriate Public Education and the Personnel Crisis for Students with Visual Impairments and Blindness. | publisher = Center on Personnel Studies in Special Education | date = April 2003 }}</ref> In 1972, the Aid to the Blind program and two others combined under Title XVI of the Social Security Act to form the [[Supplemental Security Income]] program<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/80chap12.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-23 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924120114/http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/80chap12.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 }}</ref> which states:\n<blockquote>An individual shall be considered to be blind for purposes of this title if he has central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens.

Visual acuity alone is not always a good predictor of the degree of problems a person may have. Someone with relatively good acuity (e.g., 20/40) can have difficulty with daily functioning, while someone with worse acuity (e.g., 20/200) may function reasonably well if their visual demands are not great.\n\nThe [[American Medical Association]] has estimated that the loss of one eye equals 25% impairment of the visual system and 24% impairment of the whole person;<ref name=colenbrander/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.useironline.org/Prevention.htm | title = Eye Trauma Epidemiology and Prevention | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060528033458/http://www.useironline.org/Prevention.htm | archive-date=2006-05-28 }}</ref> total loss of vision in both eyes is considered to be 100% visual impairment and 85% impairment of the whole person.<ref name=colenbrander/>\n\nSome people who fall into this category can use their considerable residual vision&nbsp;\u2013 their remaining sight&nbsp;\u2013 to complete daily tasks without relying on alternative methods. The role of a low vision specialist (optometrist or ophthalmologist) is to maximize the functional level of a patient's vision by optical or non-optical means. Primarily, this is by use of magnification in the form of telescopic systems for distance vision and optical or electronic magnification for near tasks.\n\nPeople with significantly reduced acuity may benefit from training conducted by individuals trained in the provision of technical aids. Low [[Vision Rehabilitation|vision rehabilitation]] professionals, some of whom are connected to an agency for the blind, can provide advice on lighting and contrast to maximize remaining vision. These professionals also have access to non-visual aids, and can instruct patients in their uses.\n\nThe subjects making the most use of rehabilitation instruments, who lived alone, and preserved their own mobility and occupation were the least depressed, with the lowest risk of suicide and the highest level of social integration.\n\nThose with worsening sight and the prognosis of eventual blindness are at comparatively high risk of suicide and thus may be in need of supportive services. Many studies have demonstrated how rapid acceptance of the serious visual handicap has led to a better, more productive compliance with rehabilitation programs. Moreover, psychological distress has been reported to be at its highest when sight loss is not complete, but the prognosis is unfavorable. Therefore, early intervention is imperative for enabling successful psychological adjustment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = De Leo D, Hickey PA, Meneghel G, Cantor CH | title = Blindness, fear of

Blind French soldiers learning to make baskets, World War I.]]\nEye injuries, most often occurring in people under 30, are the leading cause of monocular blindness (vision loss in one eye) throughout the [[United States]]. Injuries and cataracts affect the eye itself, while abnormalities such as [[optic nerve hypoplasia]] affect the nerve bundle that sends signals from the eye to the back of the brain, which can lead to decreased visual acuity.\n\n[[Cortical blindness]] results from injuries to the [[occipital lobe]] of the [[Human brain|brain]] that prevent the brain from correctly receiving or interpreting signals from the [[optic nerve]]. Symptoms of cortical blindness vary greatly across individuals and may be more severe in periods of exhaustion or stress. It is common for people with cortical blindness to have poorer vision later in the day.\n\nBlinding has been used as an [[blinding (punishment)|act of vengeance and torture]] in some instances, to deprive a person of a major sense by which they can navigate or interact within the world, act fully independently, and be aware of events surrounding them. An example from the classical realm is [[Oedipus]], who gouges out his own eyes after realizing that he fulfilled the awful prophecy spoken of him. Having crushed the Bulgarians, the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] blinded as many as 15,000 prisoners taken in the battle, before releasing them.<ref>Finlay, George (1856). ''History of the Byzantine Empire from DCCXVI to MLVII'', 2nd Edition, Published by W. Blackwood, pp. 444\u2013445.</ref> Contemporary examples include the addition of methods such as [[acid throwing]] as a form of [[disfigurement]].\n\n===Genetic defects===\nPeople with [[albinism]] often have vision loss to the extent that many are legally blind, though few of them actually cannot see. [[Leber congenital amaurosis]] can cause total blindness or severe sight loss from birth or early childhood.\n\nRecent advances in [[genetic map|mapping]] of the [[human genome]] have identified other genetic causes of [[low vision]] or blindness. One such example is [[Bardet\u2013Biedl syndrome]].\n\n===Poisoning===\nRarely, blindness is caused by the intake of certain chemicals. A well-known example is [[methanol]], which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating, and breaks down into the substances [[formaldehyde]] and [[formic acid]] which in turn can cause blindness, an array of other health complications, and death.<ref name=\"Methanol\">{{cite web  | title = Methanol  | work = Symptoms of Methanol Poisoning  | publisher = Canada Safety Council  | year = 2005  | url = http://www.safety-council.org/info/OSH/methanol.htm  | doi =  | access-date=27 March 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070220004549/http://www.safety-council.org/info/OSH/methanol.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 20 February 2007}}</ref> When competing with [[ethanol]] for metabolism, ethanol is metabolized first, and the onset of toxicity is delayed.

[[Orientation and Mobility|Orientation and mobility specialists]] are professionals who are specifically trained to teach people with visual impairments how to travel safely, confidently, and independently in the home and the community. These professionals can also help blind people to practice travelling on specific routes which they may use often, such as the route from one's house to a convenience store. Becoming familiar with an environment or route can make it much easier for a blind person to navigate successfully.\n\nTools such as the [[white cane]] with a red tip \u2013 the [[international symbols|international symbol]] of blindness \u2013 may also be used to improve mobility. A long cane is used to extend the user's range of touch sensation. It is usually swung in a low sweeping motion, across the intended path of travel, to detect obstacles. However, techniques for cane travel can vary depending on the user and/or the situation. Some visually impaired persons do not carry these kinds of canes, opting instead for the shorter, lighter identification (ID) cane. Still others require a support cane. The choice depends on the individual's vision, motivation, and other factors.\n\nA small number of people employ [[guide dog]]s to assist in mobility. These dogs are trained to navigate around various obstacles, and to indicate when it becomes necessary to go up or down a step. However, the helpfulness of guide dogs is limited by the inability of dogs to understand complex directions. The human half of the guide dog team does the directing, based upon skills acquired through previous mobility training. In this sense, the handler might be likened to an aircraft's navigator, who must know how to get from one place to another, and the dog to the pilot, who gets them there safely.\n\n[[GPS for the visually impaired|GPS devices]] can also be used as a mobility aid. Such software can assist blind people with orientation and navigation, but it is not a replacement for traditional mobility tools such as white canes and guide dogs.\n\nSome blind people are skilled at [[human echolocation|echolocating]] silent objects simply by producing mouth clicks and listening to the returning echoes. It has been shown that blind echolocation experts use what is normally the \"visual\" part of their brain to process the echoes.<ref name=Thaler2011>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thaler L, Arnott SR, Goodale MA | title = Neural correlates of natural human echolocation in early and late blind echolocation experts | journal = PLOS One | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e20162 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21633496 | pmc = 3102086 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0020162 | bibcode = 2011PLoSO...620162T }}</ref><ref name=\"Reader\">{{citation\n |title       = Bat Man\n |publisher   = Reader's Digest\n |date        = June 2012\n |url         = http://www.uwo.ca/bmi/news/bmi_news/bat_man.html\n |access-date  = 14 March 2014\n |url-status     = live\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20140315184642/http://www.uwo.ca/bmi/news/bmi_news/bat_man.html\n |archive-date = 15 March 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nGovernment actions are sometimes taken to make public places more accessible to blind people. Public transportation is freely available to the blind in many cities. [[Tactile paving]] and [[Pedestrian crossing#Enhancements for disabled people|audible traffic signals]] can make it easier and safer for visually impaired pedestrians to cross streets. In addition to making rules about who can and cannot use a cane, some governments mandate the [[Priority (right of way)|right-of-way]] be given to users of white canes or guide dogs.\n\n===Reading and magnification===\n[[File:Watch for the blind2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Braille watch]]]]\nMost visually impaired people who are not totally blind read print, either of a regular size or enlarged by magnification devices. Many also read [[large-print]], which is easier for them to read without such devices. A variety of [[magnifying glass]]es, some handheld, and some on desktops, can make reading easier for them.\n\nOthers read [[Braille]] (or the infrequently used [[Moon type]]), or rely on [[audiobook|talking books]] and readers or [[reading machine]]s, which convert printed text to speech or [[Braille]]. They use computers with special hardware such as [[image scanner|scanners]] and [[refreshable Braille display]]s as well as software written specifically for the blind, such as [[optical character recognition]] applications and [[screen reader]]s.\n\nSome people access these materials through agencies for the blind, such as the [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] in the United States, the [[National Library for the Blind]] or the [[Royal National Institute for the Blind|RNIB]] in the United Kingdom.\n\n[[Closed-circuit television]]s, equipment that enlarges and contrasts textual items, are a more [[high-tech]] alternative to traditional magnification devices.\n\nThere are also over 100 [[radio reading service]]s throughout the world that provide people with vision impairments with readings from periodicals over the radio. The International Association of Audio Information Services provides links to all of these organizations.\n\n===Computers and mobile technology===\nAccess technology such as [[screen reader]]s, [[screen magnifier]]s and [[refreshable Braille display]]s enable the blind to use mainstream computer applications and [[mobile phone]]s. The availability of assistive technology is increasing, accompanied by concerted efforts to ensure the accessibility of information technology to all potential users, including the blind. Later versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] include an Accessibility Wizard & Magnifier for those with partial vision, and [[Microsoft Narrator]], a simple screen reader. [[Linux distribution]]s (as [[live CD]]s) for the blind include [[Vinux]] and [[Adriane Knoppix]], the latter developed in part by [[Klaus Knopper|Adriane Knopper]] who has a visual impairment.  macOS and iOS  also come with a built-in screen reader called [[VoiceOver]], while [[Google TalkBack]] is built in to most Android devices.\n\nThe movement towards greater [[web accessibility]] is opening a far wider number of websites to [[adaptive technology]], making the web a more inviting place for visually impaired surfers.\n\nExperimental approaches in [[sensory substitution]] are beginning to provide access to arbitrary live views from a [[camera]].\n\nModified visual output that includes large print and/or clear simple graphics can be of benefit to users with some residual vision.<ref name=\"dynamicdiversity\">Gregor, P., Newell, A.F., Zajicek, M.

They may also enlarge or mark dials on devices such as ovens and thermostats to make them usable. Other techniques used by blind people to assist them in daily activities include:\n\n*Adaptations of [[coin]]s and [[banknote]]s so that the value can be determined by touch. For example:\n** In some currencies, such as the [[euro]], the [[pound sterling]] and the [[Indian rupee]], the size of a note increases with its value.\n** On US coins, pennies and dimes, and nickels and quarters are similar in size. The larger denominations (dimes and quarters) have ridges along the sides (historically used to prevent the \"shaving\" of precious metals from the coins), which can now be used for identification.\n** Some currencies' [[banknotes]] have a tactile feature to indicate denomination. For example, the [[Canadian currency tactile feature]] is a system of raised dots in one corner, based on Braille cells but not standard [[Braille]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/accessibility.html | title = Accessibility features \u2013 Bank Notes | publisher = Bank of Canada | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429132719/http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/accessibility.html | archive-date = April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n** It is also possible to fold notes in different ways to assist recognition.\n*Labeling and tagging clothing and other personal items\n*Placing different types of food at different positions on a dinner plate\n*Marking controls of household appliances\n\nMost people, once they have been visually impaired for long enough, devise their own adaptive strategies in all areas of personal and professional management.\n\nFor the blind, there are books in braille, audio-books, and text-to-speech computer programs, machines and [[e-book readers]]. Low vision people can make use of these tools as well as [[large-print]] reading materials and e-book readers that provide large [[font]] sizes.\n\nComputers are important tools of integration for the visually impaired person. They allow, using standard or specific programs, screen magnification and conversion of text into sound or touch (Braille line), and are useful for all levels of visual handicap. [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] scanners can, in conjunction with text-to-speech software, read the contents of books and documents aloud via computer. Vendors also build closed-circuit televisions that electronically magnify paper, and even change its contrast and color, for visually impaired users. For more information, consult [[Assistive technology]].\n\nIn adults with low vision there is no conclusive evidence supporting one form of reading aid over another.<ref name=\"Virgili\"/> In several studies stand-mounted devices allowed faster reading than hand-held or portable optical aids.<ref name=\"Virgili\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Virgili G, Acosta R, Bentley SA, Giacomelli G, Allcock C, Evans JR | title = Reading aids for adults with low vision | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 4 | pages = CD003303 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29664159 | pmc = 6494537 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003303.pub4 }}</ref> While electronic aids may allow faster reading for individuals with low vision, portability, ease of use, and affordability must be considered for people.<ref name=Virgili/>\n\nChildren with low vision sometimes have reading delays, but do benefit from phonics-based beginning reading instruction methods. Engaging phonics instruction is multisensory, highly motivating, and hands-on. Typically students are first taught the most frequent sounds of the alphabet letters, especially the so-called short vowel sounds, then taught to blend sounds together with three-letter consonant-vowel-consonant words such as cat, red, sit, hot, sun. Hands-on (or kinesthetically appealing) VERY enlarged print materials such as those found in \"The Big Collection of Phonics Flipbooks\" by Lynn Gordon (Scholastic, 2010) are helpful for teaching word families and blending skills to beginning readers with low vision. Beginning reading instructional materials should focus primarily on the lower-case letters, not the capital letters (even though they are larger) because reading text requires familiarity (mostly) with lower-case letters. Phonics-based beginning reading should also be supplemented with phonemic awareness lessons, writing opportunities, and lots of read-alouds (literature read to children daily) to stimulate motivation, vocabulary development, concept development, and comprehension skill development. Many children with low vision can be successfully included in regular education environments. Parents may need to be vigilant to ensure that the school provides the teacher and students with appropriate low vision resources, for example technology in the classroom, classroom aide time, modified educational materials, and consultation assistance with low vision experts.\n\n===Communication===\nCommunication with the visually impaired can be more difficult than communicating with someone who doesn't have vision loss. However, many people are uncomfortable with communicating with the blind, and this can cause communication barriers. One of the biggest obstacles in communicating with visually impaired individuals comes from face-to-face interactions.<ref name=\"BIALISTOCK\">Bialistock, R. (2005). Towards better communication, from the interest point of view. or-skills of sight-glish for the blind and visually impaired. International Congress Series, 1282, 793\u2013795.</ref> There are many factors that can cause the sighted to become uncomfortable while communicating face to face. There are many non-verbal factors that hinder communication between the visually impaired and the sighted, more often than verbal factors do. These factors, which Rivka Bialistock<ref name=\"BIALISTOCK\" /> mentions in her article, include:\n\n*Lack of facial expressions, mimics, or body gestures/responses\n*Non-verbal gestures that could imply the visually impaired individual not appearing interested\n*Speaking when not anticipated or not speaking when anticipated\n*Fear of offending the visually impaired\n*Standing too close and invading the personal comfort level\n*Having to exercise or ignore feelings of pity\n*Being uncomfortable with touching objects or people\n*A look of detachment or disengagement\n*Dependency\n*Being reminded of the fear of becoming blind\n\nThe blind person sends these signals or types of non-verbal communication without being aware that they are doing so. These factors can all affect the way an individual would feel about communicating with the visually impaired. This leaves the visually impaired feeling rejected and lonely.\n\n====Adjusting attitude====\n\nIn the article ''Towards better communication, from the interest point of view. Or\u2014skills of sight-glish for the blind and visually impaired'', the author, Rivka Bialistock <ref name=\"BIALISTOCK\" /> comes up with a method to reduce individuals being uncomfortable with communicating with the visually impaired. This method is called blind-glish or sight-glish, which is a language for the blind, similar to English. For example, babies, who are not born and able to talk right away, communicate through sight-glish, simply seeing everything and communicating non-verbally. This comes naturally to sighted babies, and by teaching this same method to babies with a visual impairment can improve their ability to communicate better, from the very beginning.\n\nTo avoid the rejected feeling of the visually impaired, people need to treat the blind the same way they would treat anyone else, rather than treating them like they have a disability, and need special attention. People may feel that it is improper to, for example, tell their blind child to look at them when they are speaking. However, this contributes to the sight-glish method.<ref name=\"BIALISTOCK\" /> It is important to disregard any mental fears or uncomfortable feelings people have while communicating (verbally and non-verbally) face-to-face.\n\n====Surroundings====\nIndividuals with a visual disability not only have to find ways to communicate effectively with the people around them, but their environment as well. The blind or visually impaired rely largely on their other senses such as hearing, touch, and smell in order to understand their surroundings.<ref name=\"JAMES\">{{cite book |last1=Jan |first1=James |last2=Freeman |first2=Roger |last3=Scott |first3=Eileen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Visual Impairment in Children and Adolescents |date=1977 |publisher=Grune and Stratton |location=111 Fifth Avenue New York, NY 10003 |isbn=978-0-8089-1010-7 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/visualimpairment0000unse/page/17 17]\u201327, 113\u2013121, 187\u2013227 |url=https://archive.org/details/visualimpairment0000unse|url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n=====Sound=====\nSound is one of the most important senses that the blind or visually impaired use in order to locate objects in their surroundings. A form of echolocation is used, similarly to that of a bat.<ref name=\"pmid23391560\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnott SR, Thaler L, Milne JL, Kish D, Goodale MA | title = Shape-specific activation of occipital cortex in an early blind echolocation expert | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 938\u201349 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23391560 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.01.024 | url = http://dro.dur.ac.uk/12170/1/12170.pdf }}</ref> Echolocation from a person's perspective is when the person uses sound waves generated from speech or other forms of noise such as cane tapping, which reflect off of objects and bounce back at the person giving them a rough idea of where the object is. This does not mean they can depict details based on sound but rather where objects are in order to interact, or avoid them. Increases in atmospheric pressure and humidity increase a person's ability to use sound to their advantage as wind or any form of background noise impairs it.<ref name=\"JAMES\" />\n\n=====Touch=====\nTouch is also an important aspect of how blind or visually impaired people perceive the world. Touch gives immense amount of information in the person's immediate surrounding. Feeling anything with detail gives off information on shape, size, texture, temperature, and many other qualities. Touch also helps with communication; braille is a form of communication in which people use their fingers to feel elevated bumps on a surface and can understand what is meant to be interpreted.<ref name=\"pmid16282598\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sadato N | title = How the blind \"see\" Braille: lessons from functional magnetic resonance imaging | journal = The Neuroscientist : A Review Journal Bringing Neurobiology, Neurology and Psychiatry | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 577\u201382 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16282598 | doi = 10.1177/1073858405277314 }}</ref> There are some issues and limitations with touch as not all objects are accessible to feel, which makes it difficult to perceive the actual object. Another limiting factor is that the learning process of identifying objects with touch is much slower than identifying objects with sight. This is due to the fact the object needs to be approached and carefully felt until a rough idea can be constructed in the brain.<ref name=\"JAMES\" />\n\n=====Smell=====\nCertain smells can be associated with specific areas and help a person with vision problems to remember a familiar area. This way there is a better chance of recognizing an area's layout in order to navigate themselves through. The same can be said for people as well. Some people have their own special odor that a person with a more trained sense of smell can pick up. A person with an impairment of their vision can use this to recognize people within their vicinity without them saying a word.<ref name=\"JAMES\" />\n\n====Communication development====\nVisual impairment can have profound effects on the development of infant and child communication. The language and social development of a child or infant can be very delayed by the inability to see the world around them.\n\n=====Social development=====\nSocial development includes interactions with the people surrounding the infant in the beginning of its life. To a child with vision, a smile from a parent is the first symbol of recognition and communication, and is almost an instant factor of communication. For a visually impaired infant, recognition of a parent's voice will be noticed at approximately two months old, but a smile will only be evoked through touch between parent and baby. This primary form of communication is greatly delayed for the child and will prevent other forms of communication from developing. Social interactions are more complicated because subtle visual cues are missing and facial expressions from others are lost.\n\nDue to delays in a child's communication development, they may appear to be disinterested in social activity with peers, non-communicative and uneducated on how to communicate with other people. This may cause the child to be avoided by peers and consequently overprotected by family members.\n\n=====Language development=====\nWith sight, much of what is learned by a child is learned through imitation of others, whereas a visually impaired child needs very planned instruction directed at the development of postponed imitation. A visually impaired infant may jabber and imitate words sooner than a sighted child, but may show delay when combining words to say themselves, the child may tend to initiate few questions and their use of adjectives is infrequent. Normally the child's sensory experiences are not readily coded into language and this may cause them to store phrases and sentences in their memory and repeat them out of context. The language of the blind child does not seem to mirror their developing knowledge of the world, but rather their knowledge of the language of others.\n\nA visually impaired child may also be hesitant to explore the world around them due to fear of the unknown and also may be discouraged from exploration by overprotective family members. Without concrete experiences, the child is not able to develop meaningful concepts or the language to describe or think about them.<ref>Strickling, C., (2010, October 6).

Texas, USA [[Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired]]</ref>\n\n===Healthcare access===\nVisual impairment has the ability to create consequences for health and well being. Visual impairment is increasing, especially among older people. It is recognized that those individuals with visual impairment are likely to have limited access to information and healthcare facilities, and may not receive the best care possible because not all health care professionals are aware of specific needs related to vision. Accommodation may require alternative means of communication.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimates that in 2012 there were 285 million visually impaired people in the world, of which 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind.<ref name=WHO2014/>\n\nOf those who are blind 90% live in the developing world.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite document | vauthors = Bosanquet N, Mehta P | title = Evidence base to support the UK Vision Strategy. | publisher = [[RNIB]] and [[The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association]] | citeseerx = 10.1.1.649.6742 }}</ref> Worldwide for each blind person, an average of 3.4 people have low vision, with country and regional variation ranging from 2.4 to 5.5.<ref name=\"WHO\">World Health Organization{{full citation needed|date=February 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''By age:''' Visual impairment is unequally distributed across age groups.

This means that a legally blind individual would have to stand {{convert|20|ft|m}} from an object to see it\u2014with [[corrective lens]]es\u2014with the same degree of clarity as a normally sighted person could from {{convert|200|ft|m}}. In many areas, people with average acuity who nonetheless have a [[visual field]] of less than 20 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (the norm being 180 degrees) are also classified as being legally blind.\nApproximately fifteen percent of those deemed legally blind, by any measure, have no light or form perception. The rest have some vision, from light perception alone to relatively good acuity. [[Low vision]] is sometimes used to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionaware.org/info/your-eye-condition/eye-health/low-vision/low-vision-terms-and-descriptions/1235|title=Low Vision and Legal Blindness Terms and Descriptions|publisher=American Foundation for the Blind|access-date=2017-02-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301010338/http://www.visionaware.org/info/your-eye-condition/eye-health/low-vision/low-vision-terms-and-descriptions/1235|archive-date=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\n===Literature and art===\n{{see also|Blindness in literature}}\n\n====Antiquity====\nThe [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of ancient [[Peru]] depicted the blind in their ceramics.<ref>Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: [[Thames and Hudson]], 1997.</ref>\n\nIn Greek myth, [[Tiresias]] was a prophet famous for his [[clairvoyance]]. According to one myth, he was blinded by the gods as punishment for revealing their secrets, while another holds that he was blinded as punishment after he saw [[Athena]] naked while she was bathing. In [[the Odyssey]], the one-eyed Cyclops [[Polyphemus]] captures [[Odysseus]], who blinds Polyphemus to escape. In Norse mythology, [[Loki]] tricks the blind god [[H\u00f6\u00f0r]] into killing his brother [[Baldr]], the god of happiness.\n\nThe [[New Testament]] contains numerous instances of [[Miracles of Jesus|Jesus performing miracles]] to heal the blind. According to the Gospels, Jesus healed [[Healing the two blind men in Galilee|the two blind men of Galilee]], [[Blind man of Bethsaida|the blind man of Bethsaida]], [[Healing the blind near Jericho|the blind man of Jericho]] and [[Healing the blind at birth|the man who was born blind]].\n\nThe parable of the [[blind men and an elephant]] has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of [[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhist]], [[Sufi]] and [[Hindu]] lore. In various versions of the tale, a group of blind men (or men in the dark) touch an [[elephant]] to learn what it is like. Each one feels a different part, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then compare notes and learn that they are in complete disagreement.\n\n\"[[Three Blind Mice]]\" is a medieval [[English language|English]] [[nursery rhyme]] about three blind mice whose tails are cut off after chasing the farmer's wife. The work is explicitly incongruous, ending with the comment ''Did you ever see such a sight in your life, As three blind mice?''\n\n====Modern times====\n[[File:Vel\u00e1zquez Blind woman.jpg|upright|thumb|''Blind Woman'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 de Ribera 018.jpg|upright|thumb|''The Sense of Touch'' by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] depicts a blind man holding a marble head in his hands.]]\nPoet [[John Milton]], who went blind in mid-life, composed [[On His Blindness]], a sonnet about coping with blindness. The work posits that ''[those] who best Bear [God]'s mild yoke, they serve him best.''\n\nThe Dutch painter and engraver [[Rembrandt]] often depicted scenes from the apocryphal [[Book of Tobit]], which tells the story of a blind patriarch who is healed by his son, Tobias, with the help of the archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]].<ref>[[Julius Held]], ''Rembrandt and the Book of Tobit'', Gehenna Press, Northampton MA, 1964.</ref>\n\nSlaver-turned-abolitionist [[John Newton]] composed the hymn [[Amazing Grace]] about a wretch who ''\"once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.\"'' Blindness, in this sense, is used both metaphorically (to refer to someone who was ignorant but later became knowledgeable) and literally, as a reference to those healed in the Bible. In the later years of his life, Newton himself would go blind.\n\n[[H. G. Wells]]' story \"[[The Country of the Blind]]\" explores what would happen if a sighted man found himself trapped in a country of blind people to emphasise society's attitude to blind people by turning the situation on its head.\n\n[[Bob Dylan]]'s anti-war song \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" twice alludes to metaphorical blindness: ''How many times can a man turn his head // and pretend that he just doesn't see... How many times must a man look up // Before he can see the sky?''\n\nContemporary fiction contains numerous well-known [[:Category:Fictional blind characters|blind characters]]. Some of these characters can see by means of devices, such as the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], who can see via his super-human hearing acuity, or ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Geordi La Forge]], who can see with the aid of a [[VISOR]], a fictional device that transmits optical signals to his brain.\n\n===Sports===\nBlind and partially sighted people participate in sports, such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[snow skiing]] and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]].

For example, a blind date is a date in which the people involved have not previously met; a [[blind experiment]] is one in which information is kept from either the experimenter or the participant to mitigate the [[placebo effect]] or [[observer bias]]. The expression \"[[blind leading the blind]]\" refers to incapable people leading other incapable people. Being blind to something means not understanding or being aware of it. A \"[[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]\" is an area where someone cannot see: for example, where a car driver cannot see because parts of his car's bodywork are in the way; metaphorically, a topic on which an individual is unaware of their own biases, and therefore of the resulting distortions of their own judgements (see [[Bias blind spot]]).\n\n==Research==\n{{Main|Visual prosthesis}}\nA 2008 study tested the effect of using [[gene therapy]] to help restore the sight of patients with a rare form of inherited blindness, known as [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]] or LCA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bainbridge JW, Smith AJ, Barker SS, Robbie S, Henderson R, Balaggan K, Viswanathan A, Holder GE, Stockman A, Tyler N, Petersen-Jones S, Bhattacharya SS, Thrasher AJ, Fitzke FW, Carter BJ, Rubin GS, Moore AT, Ali RR | display-authors = 6 | title = Effect of gene therapy on visual function in Leber's congenital amaurosis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 358 | issue = 21 | pages = 2231\u20139 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18441371 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0802268 | url = http://cvrl.ioo.ucl.ac.uk/people/stockman/pubs/2008%20gene%20therapy%20b%20et%20al.pdf | publisher = [[Massachusetts Medical Society]] }}</ref> Leber's Congenital Amaurosis damages the light receptors in the retina and usually begins affecting sight in early childhood, with worsening vision until complete blindness around the age of 30.\n\nThe study used a common cold virus to deliver a normal version of the gene called [[RPE65]] directly into the eyes of affected patients. Remarkably, all 3 patients, aged 19, 22 and 25, responded well to the treatment and reported improved vision following the procedure. Due to the age of the patients and the degenerative nature of LCA, the improvement of vision in gene therapy patients is encouraging for researchers. It is hoped that gene therapy may be even more effective in younger LCA patients who have experienced limited vision loss, as well as in other blind or partially blind individuals.\n\nTwo experimental treatments for retinal problems include a cybernetic replacement and transplant of fetal retinal cells.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113968653 |title=Bionic Eye Opens New World Of Sight For Blind |first=Jon |last=Hamilton  | name-list-format = vanc |date=20 October 2009 |access-date=9 March 2019 |work=[[NPR]]}}</ref>\n\nThere is no high-quality evidence on the effect of assistive technologies on educational outcomes and quality of life in children with low vision as of 2015,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas R, Barker L, Rubin G, Dahlmann-Noor A | title = Assistive technology for children and young people with low vision | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 6 | pages = CD011350 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26086876 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011350.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group }}</ref> nor is there evidence on magnifying reading aids in children.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barker L, Thomas R, Rubin G, Dahlmann-Noor A | title = Optical reading aids for children and young people with low vision | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD010987 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25738963 | pmc = 6769181 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010987.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group }}</ref> Low-vision rehabilitation does not appear to have an important impact on health-related quality of life, though some low-vision rehabilitation interventions, particularly psychological therapies and methods of enhancing vision, may improve vision-related quality of life in people with sight loss.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van Nispen RM, Virgili G, Hoeben M, Langelaan M, Klevering J, Keunen JE, van Rens GH | title = Low vision rehabilitation for better quality of life in visually impaired adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | pages = CD006543 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31985055 | pmc = 6984642 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006543.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group }}</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\n{{Main|Blindness in animals}}\nStatements that certain species of [[mammal]]s are \"born blind\" refers to them being born with their eyes closed and their eyelids fused together; the eyes open later. One example is the [[rabbit]]. In humans, the eyelids are fused for a while before birth, but open again before the normal birth time; however, very [[premature babies]] are sometimes born with their eyes fused shut, and opening later. Other animals, such as the [[blind mole rat]], are truly blind and rely on other senses.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nThe theme of blind animals has been a powerful one in literature. [[Peter Shaffer]]'s Tony Award-winning play, [[Equus (play)|''Equus'']], tells the story of a boy who blinds six horses. [[Theodore Taylor (author)|Theodore Taylor]]'s classic young adult novel, ''[[The Trouble With Tuck]]'', is about a teenage girl, Helen, who trains her blind dog to follow and trust a seeing-eye dog.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Acute visual loss]]\n*[[Blindness and education]]\n*[[Color blindness]]\n*[[Diplopia]]\n*[[Nyctalopia]]\n*[[Recovery from blindness]]\n*[[Stereoblindness]]\n*[[Tactile alphabet]]\n*[[Tactile graphic]]\n*[[Tangible symbol systems]]\n*[[Visual agnosia]]\n*[[Visual impairment due to intracranial pressure]]\n*[[World Blind Union]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{dmoz|Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Eye_Disorders/Blindness|Blindness}}\n* {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Blindness}}\n{{Medical condition classification and resources\n| ICD10 = {{ICD10|H|54|0|h|53}}, {{ICD10|H|54|1|h|53}}, {{ICD10|H|54|4|h|53}}\n| ICD9 = {{ICD9|369}}\n| MeSH=D001766\n| Width = 100\n| ICDO =\n| OMIM =\n| DiseasesDB = 28256\n| MedlinePlus =003040\n| eMedicineSubj =\n| eMedicineTopic =\n}}\n{{Eye pathology}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Visual impairment}}\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Blindness| ]]\n[[Category:Diseases of the eye and adnexa]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n[[Category:RTTNEURO]]\n", "text_old": "{{Redirect|Blindness}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Visual impairment\n| synonyms        = Vision impairment, vision loss\n| image           = Long cane.jpg\n| image_size      = 120px\n| caption         = A [[white cane]], the international symbol of blindness\n| field           = [[Ophthalmology]]\n| symptoms        = Decreased ability to [[visual perception|see]]<ref name=WHODef/><ref name=CDC2011/>\n| complications   = [[Non-24-hour sleep\u2013wake disorder]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Auger RR, Burgess HJ, Emens JS, Deriy LV, Thomas SM, Sharkey KM | title = Clinical Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Intrinsic Circadian Rhythm Sleep-Wake Disorders: Advanced Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (ASWPD), Delayed Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (DSWPD), Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder (N24SWD), and Irregular Sleep-Wake Rhythm Disorder (ISWRD).

When the vision in the better eye with best possible glasses correction is:\n\n* 20/30 to 20/60 : is considered mild vision loss, or near-normal vision\n* 20/70 to 20/160 : is considered moderate visual impairment, or moderate low vision\n* 20/200 to 20/400 : is considered severe visual impairment, or severe low vision\n* 20/500 to 20/1,000 : is considered profound visual impairment, or profound low vision\n* More than 20/1,000 : is considered near-total visual impairment, or near total blindness\n* No light perception (NLP) : is considered total visual impairment, or total blindness\n\nBlindness is defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as vision in a person's best eye with best correction of less than 20/500 or a [[visual field]] of less than 10 degrees.<ref name=Mab2006/> This definition was set in 1972, and there is ongoing discussion as to whether it should be altered to officially include uncorrected refractive errors.<ref name=WHODef/>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nSeverely sight impaired \n* Defined as having central visual acuity of less than 3/60 with normal fields of vision, or gross visual field restriction. \n* Unable to see at {{convert|3|m|0}} what the normally sighted person sees at {{convert|60|m}}.\n\nSight impaired \n* Able to see at {{convert|3|m|0}}, but not at {{convert|6|m}}, what the normally sighted person sees at {{convert|60|m}}\n* Less severe visual impairment is not captured by registration data, and its prevalence is difficult to quantify\n\nLow vision \n* A visual acuity of less than 6/18 but greater than 3/60. \n* Not eligible to drive and may have difficulty recognising faces across a street, watching television, or choosing clean, unstained, co-ordinated clothing.<ref>Cupples, M., Hart, P., Johnston, A., & Jackson, A.

The [[Department of Health]] identifies three groups of people who may be classified as severely visually impaired.<ref name=\"dh.gov.uk\"/>\n#Those below 3/60 (equivalent to 20/400 in US notation) [[Snellen chart|Snellen]] (most people below 3/60 are severely sight impaired).\n#Those better than 3/60 but below 6/60 Snellen (people who have a very contracted field of vision only).\n#Those 6/60 Snellen or above (people in this group who have a contracted [[field of vision]] especially if the contraction is in the lower part of the field).\n\nThe Department of Health also state that a person is more likely to be classified as severely visually impaired if their eyesight has failed recently or if they are an older individual, both groups being perceived as less able to adapt to their vision loss.<ref name=\"dh.gov.uk\"/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, any person with vision that cannot be corrected to better than 20/200 in the best eye, or who has 20 [[visual angle|degrees]] ([[angular diameter|diameter]]) or less of visual field remaining, is considered legally blind or eligible for disability classification and possible inclusion in certain government sponsored programs.\n\nIn the United States, the terms ''partially sighted'', ''low vision'', ''legally blind'' and ''totally blind'' are used by schools, colleges, and other educational institutions to describe students with visual impairments.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nichcy.org/ | title = National Dissemination Center for Children with Disabilities | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070911232205/http://www.nichcy.org/ | archive-date=2007-09-11 }}</ref> They are defined as follows:\n*''Partially sighted'' indicates some type of visual problem, with a need of person to receive special education in some cases.\n*''Low vision'' generally refers to a severe visual impairment, not necessarily limited to distance vision. Low vision applies to all individuals with sight who are unable to read the newspaper at a normal viewing distance, even with the aid of eyeglasses or contact lenses. They use a combination of vision and other senses to learn, although they may require adaptations in lighting or the size of print, and, sometimes, [[Braille]].\n**''[[Myopia|Myopic]]'' \u2013 unable to see distant objects clearly, commonly called near-sighted or short-sighted.\n**''[[Hyperopia|Hyperopic]]'' \u2013 unable to see close objects clearly, commonly called far-sighted or long-sighted.\n*''Legally blind'' indicates that a person has less than 20/200 vision in the better eye after best correction (contact lenses or glasses), or a field of vision of less than 20 degrees in the better eye.\n*''Totally blind'' students learn via Braille or other non-visual media.\n\nIn 1934, the [[American Medical Association]] adopted the following definition of blindness:\n<blockquote>Central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with corrective glasses or central visual acuity of more than 20/200 if there is a visual field defect in which the peripheral field is contracted to such an extent that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angular distance no greater than 20 degrees in the better eye.<ref name=\"Koestler\">{{cite book | vauthors = Koestler FA | date = 1976 | title = The unseen minority: a social history of blindness in the United States. | location = New York | publisher = David McKay }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe [[United States Congress]] included this definition as part of the Aid to the Blind program in the [[Social Security (United States)#Creation: The Social Security Act|Social Security Act]] passed in 1935.<ref name=\"Koestler\"/><ref name=\"Corn\">{{cite web | vauthors = Corn AL, Spungin SJ | url = http://www.coe.ufl.edu/copsse/docs/IB-10/1/IB-10.pdf | title = Free and Appropriate Public Education and the Personnel Crisis for Students with Visual Impairments and Blindness. | publisher = Center on Personnel Studies in Special Education | date = April 2003 }}</ref> In 1972, the Aid to the Blind program and two others combined under Title XVI of the Social Security Act to form the [[Supplemental Security Income]] program<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/80chap12.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-23 |url-status=live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150924120114/http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/80chap12.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 }}</ref> which states:\n<blockquote>An individual shall be considered to be blind for purposes of this title if he has central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens.

Visual acuity alone is not always a good predictor of the degree of problems a person may have. Someone with relatively good acuity (e.g., 20/40) can have difficulty with daily functioning, while someone with worse acuity (e.g., 20/200) may function reasonably well if their visual demands are not great.\n\nThe [[American Medical Association]] has estimated that the loss of one eye equals 25% impairment of the visual system and 24% impairment of the whole person;<ref name=colenbrander/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.useironline.org/Prevention.htm | title = Eye Trauma Epidemiology and Prevention | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060528033458/http://www.useironline.org/Prevention.htm | archive-date=2006-05-28 }}</ref> total loss of vision in both eyes is considered to be 100% visual impairment and 85% impairment of the whole person.<ref name=colenbrander/>\n\nSome people who fall into this category can use their considerable residual vision&nbsp;\u2013 their remaining sight&nbsp;\u2013 to complete daily tasks without relying on alternative methods. The role of a low vision specialist (optometrist or ophthalmologist) is to maximize the functional level of a patient's vision by optical or non-optical means. Primarily, this is by use of magnification in the form of telescopic systems for distance vision and optical or electronic magnification for near tasks.\n\nPeople with significantly reduced acuity may benefit from training conducted by individuals trained in the provision of technical aids. Low [[Vision Rehabilitation|vision rehabilitation]] professionals, some of whom are connected to an agency for the blind, can provide advice on lighting and contrast to maximize remaining vision. These professionals also have access to non-visual aids, and can instruct patients in their uses.\n\nThe subjects making the most use of rehabilitation instruments, who lived alone, and preserved their own mobility and occupation were the least depressed, with the lowest risk of suicide and the highest level of social integration.\n\nThose with worsening sight and the prognosis of eventual blindness are at comparatively high risk of suicide and thus may be in need of supportive services. Many studies have demonstrated how rapid acceptance of the serious visual handicap has led to a better, more productive compliance with rehabilitation programs. Moreover, psychological distress has been reported to be at its highest when sight loss is not complete, but the prognosis is unfavorable. Therefore, early intervention is imperative for enabling successful psychological adjustment.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = De Leo D, Hickey PA, Meneghel G, Cantor CH | title = Blindness, fear of

Blind French soldiers learning to make baskets, World War I.]]\nEye injuries, most often occurring in people under 30, are the leading cause of monocular blindness (vision loss in one eye) throughout the [[United States]]. Injuries and cataracts affect the eye itself, while abnormalities such as [[optic nerve hypoplasia]] affect the nerve bundle that sends signals from the eye to the back of the brain, which can lead to decreased visual acuity.\n\n[[Cortical blindness]] results from injuries to the [[occipital lobe]] of the [[Human brain|brain]] that prevent the brain from correctly receiving or interpreting signals from the [[optic nerve]]. Symptoms of cortical blindness vary greatly across individuals and may be more severe in periods of exhaustion or stress. It is common for people with cortical blindness to have poorer vision later in the day.\n\nBlinding has been used as an [[blinding (punishment)|act of vengeance and torture]] in some instances, to deprive a person of a major sense by which they can navigate or interact within the world, act fully independently, and be aware of events surrounding them. An example from the classical realm is [[Oedipus]], who gouges out his own eyes after realizing that he fulfilled the awful prophecy spoken of him. Having crushed the Bulgarians, the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] blinded as many as 15,000 prisoners taken in the battle, before releasing them.<ref>Finlay, George (1856). ''History of the Byzantine Empire from DCCXVI to MLVII'', 2nd Edition, Published by W. Blackwood, pp. 444\u2013445.</ref> Contemporary examples include the addition of methods such as [[acid throwing]] as a form of [[disfigurement]].\n\n===Genetic defects===\nPeople with [[albinism]] often have vision loss to the extent that many are legally blind, though few of them actually cannot see. [[Leber congenital amaurosis]] can cause total blindness or severe sight loss from birth or early childhood.\n\nRecent advances in [[genetic map|mapping]] of the [[human genome]] have identified other genetic causes of [[low vision]] or blindness. One such example is [[Bardet\u2013Biedl syndrome]].\n\n===Poisoning===\nRarely, blindness is caused by the intake of certain chemicals. A well-known example is [[methanol]], which is only mildly toxic and minimally intoxicating, and breaks down into the substances [[formaldehyde]] and [[formic acid]] which in turn can cause blindness, an array of other health complications, and death.<ref name=\"Methanol\">{{cite web  | title = Methanol  | work = Symptoms of Methanol Poisoning  | publisher = Canada Safety Council  | year = 2005  | url = http://www.safety-council.org/info/OSH/methanol.htm  | doi =  | access-date=27 March 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070220004549/http://www.safety-council.org/info/OSH/methanol.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 20 February 2007}}</ref> When competing with [[ethanol]] for metabolism, ethanol is metabolized first, and the onset of toxicity is delayed.

[[Orientation and Mobility|Orientation and mobility specialists]] are professionals who are specifically trained to teach people with visual impairments how to travel safely, confidently, and independently in the home and the community. These professionals can also help blind people to practice travelling on specific routes which they may use often, such as the route from one's house to a convenience store. Becoming familiar with an environment or route can make it much easier for a blind person to navigate successfully.\n\nTools such as the [[white cane]] with a red tip \u2013 the [[international symbols|international symbol]] of blindness \u2013 may also be used to improve mobility. A long cane is used to extend the user's range of touch sensation. It is usually swung in a low sweeping motion, across the intended path of travel, to detect obstacles. However, techniques for cane travel can vary depending on the user and/or the situation. Some visually impaired persons do not carry these kinds of canes, opting instead for the shorter, lighter identification (ID) cane. Still others require a support cane. The choice depends on the individual's vision, motivation, and other factors.\n\nA small number of people employ [[guide dog]]s to assist in mobility. These dogs are trained to navigate around various obstacles, and to indicate when it becomes necessary to go up or down a step. However, the helpfulness of guide dogs is limited by the inability of dogs to understand complex directions. The human half of the guide dog team does the directing, based upon skills acquired through previous mobility training. In this sense, the handler might be likened to an aircraft's navigator, who must know how to get from one place to another, and the dog to the pilot, who gets them there safely.\n\n[[GPS for the visually impaired|GPS devices]] can also be used as a mobility aid. Such software can assist blind people with orientation and navigation, but it is not a replacement for traditional mobility tools such as white canes and guide dogs.\n\nSome blind people are skilled at [[human echolocation|echolocating]] silent objects simply by producing mouth clicks and listening to the returning echoes.

Public transportation is freely available to the blind in many cities. [[Tactile paving]] and [[Pedestrian crossing#Enhancements for disabled people|audible traffic signals]] can make it easier and safer for visually impaired pedestrians to cross streets. In addition to making rules about who can and cannot use a cane, some governments mandate the [[Priority (right of way)|right-of-way]] be given to users of white canes or guide dogs.\n\n===Reading and magnification===\n[[File:Watch for the blind2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Braille watch]]]]\nMost visually impaired people who are not totally blind read print, either of a regular size or enlarged by magnification devices. Many also read [[large-print]], which is easier for them to read without such devices. A variety of [[magnifying glass]]es, some handheld, and some on desktops, can make reading easier for them.\n\nOthers read [[Braille]] (or the infrequently used [[Moon type]]), or rely on [[audiobook|talking books]] and readers or [[reading machine]]s, which convert printed text to speech or [[Braille]]. They use computers with special hardware such as [[image scanner|scanners]] and [[refreshable Braille display]]s as well as software written specifically for the blind, such as [[optical character recognition]] applications and [[screen reader]]s.\n\nSome people access these materials through agencies for the blind, such as the [[National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped]] in the United States, the [[National Library for the Blind]] or the [[Royal National Institute for the Blind|RNIB]] in the United Kingdom.\n\n[[Closed-circuit television]]s, equipment that enlarges and contrasts textual items, are a more [[high-tech]] alternative to traditional magnification devices.\n\nThere are also over 100 [[radio reading service]]s throughout the world that provide people with vision impairments with readings from periodicals over the radio. The International Association of Audio Information Services provides links to all of these organizations.\n\n===Computers and mobile technology===\nAccess technology such as [[screen reader]]s, [[screen magnifier]]s and [[refreshable Braille display]]s enable the blind to use mainstream computer applications and [[mobile phone]]s. The availability of assistive technology is increasing, accompanied by concerted efforts to ensure the accessibility of information technology to all potential users, including the blind. Later versions of [[Microsoft Windows]] include an Accessibility Wizard & Magnifier for those with partial vision, and [[Microsoft Narrator]], a simple screen reader. [[Linux distribution]]s (as [[live CD]]s) for the blind include [[Vinux]] and [[Adriane Knoppix]], the latter developed in part by [[Klaus Knopper|Adriane Knopper]] who has a visual impairment.  macOS and iOS  also come with a built-in screen reader called [[VoiceOver]], while [[Google TalkBack]] is built in to most Android devices.\n\nThe movement towards greater [[web accessibility]] is opening a far wider number of websites to [[adaptive technology]], making the web a more inviting place for visually impaired surfers.\n\nExperimental approaches in [[sensory substitution]] are beginning to provide access to arbitrary live views from a [[camera]].\n\nModified visual output that includes large print and/or clear simple graphics can be of benefit to users with some residual vision.<ref name=\"dynamicdiversity\">Gregor, P., Newell, A.F., Zajicek, M.

The larger denominations (dimes and quarters) have ridges along the sides (historically used to prevent the \"shaving\" of precious metals from the coins), which can now be used for identification.\n** Some currencies' [[banknotes]] have a tactile feature to indicate denomination. For example, the [[Canadian currency tactile feature]] is a system of raised dots in one corner, based on Braille cells but not standard [[Braille]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/accessibility.html | title = Accessibility features \u2013 Bank Notes | publisher = Bank of Canada | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429132719/http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/banknotes/accessibility.html | archive-date = April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n** It is also possible to fold notes in different ways to assist recognition.\n*Labeling and tagging clothing and other personal items\n*Placing different types of food at different positions on a dinner plate\n*Marking controls of household appliances\n\nMost people, once they have been visually impaired for long enough, devise their own adaptive strategies in all areas of personal and professional management.\n\nFor the blind, there are books in braille, audio-books, and text-to-speech computer programs, machines and [[e-book readers]]. Low vision people can make use of these tools as well as [[large-print]] reading materials and e-book readers that provide large [[font]] sizes.\n\nComputers are important tools of integration for the visually impaired person. They allow, using standard or specific programs, screen magnification and conversion of text into sound or touch (Braille line), and are useful for all levels of visual handicap. [[Optical character recognition|OCR]] scanners can, in conjunction with text-to-speech software, read the contents of books and documents aloud via computer. Vendors also build closed-circuit televisions that electronically magnify paper, and even change its contrast and color, for visually impaired users. For more information, consult [[Assistive technology]].\n\nIn adults with low vision there is no conclusive evidence supporting one form of reading aid over another.<ref name=\"Virgili\"/> In several studies stand-mounted devices allowed faster reading than hand-held or portable optical aids.<ref name=\"Virgili\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Virgili G, Acosta R, Bentley SA, Giacomelli G, Allcock C, Evans JR | title = Reading aids for adults with low vision | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 4 | pages = CD003303 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29664159 | pmc = 6494537 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003303.pub4 }}</ref> While electronic aids may allow faster reading for individuals with low vision, portability, ease of use, and affordability must be considered for people.<ref name=Virgili/>\n\nChildren with low vision sometimes have reading delays, but do benefit from phonics-based beginning reading instruction methods. Engaging phonics instruction is multisensory, highly motivating, and hands-on. Typically students are first taught the most frequent sounds of the alphabet letters, especially the so-called short vowel sounds, then taught to blend sounds together with three-letter consonant-vowel-consonant words such as cat, red, sit, hot, sun. Hands-on (or kinesthetically appealing) VERY enlarged print materials such as those found in \"The Big Collection of Phonics Flipbooks\" by Lynn Gordon (Scholastic, 2010) are helpful for teaching word families and blending skills to beginning readers with low vision. Beginning reading instructional materials should focus primarily on the lower-case letters, not the capital letters (even though they are larger) because reading text requires familiarity (mostly) with lower-case letters. Phonics-based beginning reading should also be supplemented with phonemic awareness lessons, writing opportunities, and lots of read-alouds (literature read to children daily) to stimulate motivation, vocabulary development, concept development, and comprehension skill development. Many children with low vision can be successfully included in regular education environments. Parents may need to be vigilant to ensure that the school provides the teacher and students with appropriate low vision resources, for example technology in the classroom, classroom aide time, modified educational materials, and consultation assistance with low vision experts.\n\n===Communication===\nCommunication with the visually impaired can be more difficult than communicating with someone who doesn't have vision loss. However, many people are uncomfortable with communicating with the blind, and this can cause communication barriers. One of the biggest obstacles in communicating with visually impaired individuals comes from face-to-face interactions.<ref name=\"BIALISTOCK\">Bialistock, R. (2005). Towards better communication, from the interest point of view. or-skills of sight-glish for the blind and visually impaired. International Congress Series, 1282, 793\u2013795.</ref> There are many factors that can cause the sighted to become uncomfortable while communicating face to face. There are many non-verbal factors that hinder communication between the visually impaired and the sighted, more often than verbal factors do. These factors, which Rivka Bialistock<ref name=\"BIALISTOCK\" /> mentions in her article, include:\n\n*Lack of facial expressions, mimics, or body gestures/responses\n*Non-verbal gestures that could imply the visually impaired individual not appearing interested\n*Speaking when not anticipated or not speaking when anticipated\n*Fear of offending the visually impaired\n*Standing too close and invading the personal comfort level\n*Having to exercise or ignore feelings of pity\n*Being uncomfortable with touching objects or people\n*A look of detachment or disengagement\n*Dependency\n*Being reminded of the fear of becoming blind\n\nThe blind person sends these signals or types of non-verbal communication without being aware that they are doing so. These factors can all affect the way an individual would feel about communicating with the visually impaired. This leaves the visually impaired feeling rejected and lonely.\n\n====Adjusting attitude====\n\nIn the article ''Towards better communication, from the interest point of view. Or\u2014skills of sight-glish for the blind and visually impaired'', the author, Rivka Bialistock <ref name=\"BIALISTOCK\" /> comes up with a method to reduce individuals being uncomfortable with communicating with the visually impaired. This method is called blind-glish or sight-glish, which is a language for the blind, similar to English. For example, babies, who are not born and able to talk right away, communicate through sight-glish, simply seeing everything and communicating non-verbally. This comes naturally to sighted babies, and by teaching this same method to babies with a visual impairment can improve their ability to communicate better, from the very beginning.\n\nTo avoid the rejected feeling of the visually impaired, people need to treat the blind the same way they would treat anyone else, rather than treating them like they have a disability, and need special attention. People may feel that it is improper to, for example, tell their blind child to look at them when they are speaking. However, this contributes to the sight-glish method.<ref name=\"BIALISTOCK\" /> It is important to disregard any mental fears or uncomfortable feelings people have while communicating (verbally and non-verbally) face-to-face.\n\n====Surroundings====\nIndividuals with a visual disability not only have to find ways to communicate effectively with the people around them, but their environment as well. The blind or visually impaired rely largely on their other senses such as hearing, touch, and smell in order to understand their surroundings.<ref name=\"JAMES\">{{cite book |last1=Jan |first1=James |last2=Freeman |first2=Roger |last3=Scott |first3=Eileen | name-list-format = vanc |title=Visual Impairment in Children and Adolescents |date=1977 |publisher=Grune and Stratton |location=111 Fifth Avenue New York, NY 10003 |isbn=978-0-8089-1010-7 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/visualimpairment0000unse/page/17 17]\u201327, 113\u2013121, 187\u2013227 |url=https://archive.org/details/visualimpairment0000unse|url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n=====Sound=====\nSound is one of the most important senses that the blind or visually impaired use in order to locate objects in their surroundings. A form of echolocation is used, similarly to that of a bat.<ref name=\"pmid23391560\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnott SR, Thaler L, Milne JL, Kish D, Goodale MA | title = Shape-specific activation of occipital cortex in an early blind echolocation expert | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 51 | issue = 5 | pages = 938\u201349 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23391560 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.01.024 | url = http://dro.dur.ac.uk/12170/1/12170.pdf }}</ref> Echolocation from a person's perspective is when the person uses sound waves generated from speech or other forms of noise such as cane tapping, which reflect off of objects and bounce back at the person giving them a rough idea of where the object is. This does not mean they can depict details based on sound but rather where objects are in order to interact, or avoid them. Increases in atmospheric pressure and humidity increase a person's ability to use sound to their advantage as wind or any form of background noise impairs it.<ref name=\"JAMES\" />\n\n=====Touch=====\nTouch is also an important aspect of how blind or visually impaired people perceive the world. Touch gives immense amount of information in the person's immediate surrounding. Feeling anything with detail gives off information on shape, size, texture, temperature, and many other qualities. Touch also helps with communication; braille is a form of communication in which people use their fingers to feel elevated bumps on a surface and can understand what is meant to be interpreted.<ref name=\"pmid16282598\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sadato N | title = How the blind \"see\" Braille: lessons from functional magnetic resonance imaging | journal = The Neuroscientist : A Review Journal Bringing Neurobiology, Neurology and Psychiatry | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 577\u201382 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16282598 | doi = 10.1177/1073858405277314 }}</ref> There are some issues and limitations with touch as not all objects are accessible to feel, which makes it difficult to perceive the actual object. Another limiting factor is that the learning process of identifying objects with touch is much slower than identifying objects with sight. This is due to the fact the object needs to be approached and carefully felt until a rough idea can be constructed in the brain.<ref name=\"JAMES\" />\n\n=====Smell=====\nCertain smells can be associated with specific areas and help a person with vision problems to remember a familiar area. This way there is a better chance of recognizing an area's layout in order to navigate themselves through. The same can be said for people as well. Some people have their own special odor that a person with a more trained sense of smell can pick up. A person with an impairment of their vision can use this to recognize people within their vicinity without them saying a word.<ref name=\"JAMES\" />\n\n====Communication development====\nVisual impairment can have profound effects on the development of infant and child communication. The language and social development of a child or infant can be very delayed by the inability to see the world around them.\n\n=====Social development=====\nSocial development includes interactions with the people surrounding the infant in the beginning of its life. To a child with vision, a smile from a parent is the first symbol of recognition and communication, and is almost an instant factor of communication. For a visually impaired infant, recognition of a parent's voice will be noticed at approximately two months old, but a smile will only be evoked through touch between parent and baby. This primary form of communication is greatly delayed for the child and will prevent other forms of communication from developing. Social interactions are more complicated because subtle visual cues are missing and facial expressions from others are lost.\n\nDue to delays in a child's communication development, they may appear to be disinterested in social activity with peers, non-communicative and uneducated on how to communicate with other people. This may cause the child to be avoided by peers and consequently overprotected by family members.\n\n=====Language development=====\nWith sight, much of what is learned by a child is learned through imitation of others, whereas a visually impaired child needs very planned instruction directed at the development of postponed imitation. A visually impaired infant may jabber and imitate words sooner than a sighted child, but may show delay when combining words to say themselves, the child may tend to initiate few questions and their use of adjectives is infrequent. Normally the child's sensory experiences are not readily coded into language and this may cause them to store phrases and sentences in their memory and repeat them out of context. The language of the blind child does not seem to mirror their developing knowledge of the world, but rather their knowledge of the language of others.\n\nA visually impaired child may also be hesitant to explore the world around them due to fear of the unknown and also may be discouraged from exploration by overprotective family members. Without concrete experiences, the child is not able to develop meaningful concepts or the language to describe or think about them.<ref>Strickling, C., (2010, October 6). Impact Of Visual Impairment On Development. Texas, USA [[Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired]]</ref>\n\n===Healthcare access===\nVisual impairment has the ability to create consequences for health and well being. Visual impairment is increasing, especially among older people. It is recognized that those individuals with visual impairment are likely to have limited access to information and healthcare facilities, and may not receive the best care possible because not all health care professionals are aware of specific needs related to vision. Accommodation may require alternative means of communication.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThe [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimates that in 2012 there were 285 million visually impaired people in the world, of which 246 million had low vision and 39 million were blind.<ref name=WHO2014/>\n\nOf those who are blind 90% live in the developing world.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite document | vauthors = Bosanquet N, Mehta P | title = Evidence base to support the UK Vision Strategy. | publisher = [[RNIB]] and [[The Guide Dogs for the Blind Association]] | citeseerx = 10.1.1.649.6742 }}</ref> Worldwide for each blind person, an average of 3.4 people have low vision, with country and regional variation ranging from 2.4 to 5.5.<ref name=\"WHO\">World Health Organization{{full citation needed|date=February 2012}}</ref>\n\n'''By age:''' Visual impairment is unequally distributed across age groups.

More than 90% of the world's visually impaired live in developing countries.<ref name=\"WHO\"/>\n\nSince the estimates of the 1990s, new data based on the 2002 global population show a reduction in the number of people who are blind or visually impaired, and those who are blind from the effects of infectious diseases, but an increase in the number of people who are blind from conditions related to longer life spans.<ref name=\"WHO\"/>\n\nIn 1987, it was estimated that 598,000 people in the United States met the legal definition of blindness.<ref name=\"Kirchner\">{{cite book | vauthors = Kirchner C, Stephen G, Chandu F | date = 1987 | chapter = Estimated 1987 prevalence of non-institutionalized 'severe visual impairment' by age base on 1977 estimated rates: U.

This means that a legally blind individual would have to stand {{convert|20|ft|m}} from an object to see it\u2014with [[corrective lens]]es\u2014with the same degree of clarity as a normally sighted person could from {{convert|200|ft|m}}. In many areas, people with average acuity who nonetheless have a [[visual field]] of less than 20 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (the norm being 180 degrees) are also classified as being legally blind.\nApproximately fifteen percent of those deemed legally blind, by any measure, have no light or form perception. The rest have some vision, from light perception alone to relatively good acuity. [[Low vision]] is sometimes used to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visionaware.org/info/your-eye-condition/eye-health/low-vision/low-vision-terms-and-descriptions/1235|title=Low Vision and Legal Blindness Terms and Descriptions|publisher=American Foundation for the Blind|access-date=2017-02-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301010338/http://www.visionaware.org/info/your-eye-condition/eye-health/low-vision/low-vision-terms-and-descriptions/1235|archive-date=2017-03-01}}</ref>\n\n===Literature and art===\n{{see also|Blindness in literature}}\n\n====Antiquity====\nThe [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people of ancient [[Peru]] depicted the blind in their ceramics.<ref>Berrin, Katherine & Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueol\u00f3gico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: [[Thames and Hudson]], 1997.</ref>\n\nIn Greek myth, [[Tiresias]] was a prophet famous for his [[clairvoyance]]. According to one myth, he was blinded by the gods as punishment for revealing their secrets, while another holds that he was blinded as punishment after he saw [[Athena]] naked while she was bathing. In [[the Odyssey]], the one-eyed Cyclops [[Polyphemus]] captures [[Odysseus]], who blinds Polyphemus to escape. In Norse mythology, [[Loki]] tricks the blind god [[H\u00f6\u00f0r]] into killing his brother [[Baldr]], the god of happiness.\n\nThe [[New Testament]] contains numerous instances of [[Miracles of Jesus|Jesus performing miracles]] to heal the blind. According to the Gospels, Jesus healed [[Healing the two blind men in Galilee|the two blind men of Galilee]], [[Blind man of Bethsaida|the blind man of Bethsaida]], [[Healing the blind near Jericho|the blind man of Jericho]] and [[Healing the blind at birth|the man who was born blind]].\n\nThe parable of the [[blind men and an elephant]] has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of [[Jainism|Jain]], [[Buddhist]], [[Sufi]] and [[Hindu]] lore. In various versions of the tale, a group of blind men (or men in the dark) touch an [[elephant]] to learn what it is like. Each one feels a different part, but only one part, such as the side or the tusk. They then compare notes and learn that they are in complete disagreement.\n\n\"[[Three Blind Mice]]\" is a medieval [[English language|English]] [[nursery rhyme]] about three blind mice whose tails are cut off after chasing the farmer's wife. The work is explicitly incongruous, ending with the comment ''Did you ever see such a sight in your life, As three blind mice?''\n\n====Modern times====\n[[File:Vel\u00e1zquez Blind woman.jpg|upright|thumb|''Blind Woman'' by [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]]]]\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 de Ribera 018.jpg|upright|thumb|''The Sense of Touch'' by [[Jusepe de Ribera]] depicts a blind man holding a marble head in his hands.]]\nPoet [[John Milton]], who went blind in mid-life, composed [[On His Blindness]], a sonnet about coping with blindness. The work posits that ''[those] who best Bear [God]'s mild yoke, they serve him best.''\n\nThe Dutch painter and engraver [[Rembrandt]] often depicted scenes from the apocryphal [[Book of Tobit]], which tells the story of a blind patriarch who is healed by his son, Tobias, with the help of the archangel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]].<ref>[[Julius Held]], ''Rembrandt and the Book of Tobit'', Gehenna Press, Northampton MA, 1964.</ref>\n\nSlaver-turned-abolitionist [[John Newton]] composed the hymn [[Amazing Grace]] about a wretch who ''\"once was lost, but now am found, Was blind, but now I see.\"'' Blindness, in this sense, is used both metaphorically (to refer to someone who was ignorant but later became knowledgeable) and literally, as a reference to those healed in the Bible. In the later years of his life, Newton himself would go blind.\n\n[[H. G. Wells]]' story \"[[The Country of the Blind]]\" explores what would happen if a sighted man found himself trapped in a country of blind people to emphasise society's attitude to blind people by turning the situation on its head.\n\n[[Bob Dylan]]'s anti-war song \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" twice alludes to metaphorical blindness: ''How many times can a man turn his head // and pretend that he just doesn't see... How many times must a man look up // Before he can see the sky?''\n\nContemporary fiction contains numerous well-known [[:Category:Fictional blind characters|blind characters]]. Some of these characters can see by means of devices, such as the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], who can see via his super-human hearing acuity, or ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Geordi La Forge]], who can see with the aid of a [[VISOR]], a fictional device that transmits optical signals to his brain.\n\n===Sports===\nBlind and partially sighted people participate in sports, such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[snow skiing]] and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]].

For example, a blind date is a date in which the people involved have not previously met; a [[blind experiment]] is one in which information is kept from either the experimenter or the participant to mitigate the [[placebo effect]] or [[observer bias]]. The expression \"[[blind leading the blind]]\" refers to incapable people leading other incapable people. Being blind to something means not understanding or being aware of it. A \"[[blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]\" is an area where someone cannot see: for example, where a car driver cannot see because parts of his car's bodywork are in the way; metaphorically, a topic on which an individual is unaware of their own biases, and therefore of the resulting distortions of their own judgements (see [[Bias blind spot]]).\n\n==Research==\n{{Main|Visual prosthesis}}\nA 2008 study tested the effect of using [[gene therapy]] to help restore the sight of patients with a rare form of inherited blindness, known as [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]] or LCA.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bainbridge JW, Smith AJ, Barker SS, Robbie S, Henderson R, Balaggan K, Viswanathan A, Holder GE, Stockman A, Tyler N, Petersen-Jones S, Bhattacharya SS, Thrasher AJ, Fitzke FW, Carter BJ, Rubin GS, Moore AT, Ali RR | display-authors = 6 | title = Effect of gene therapy on visual function in Leber's congenital amaurosis | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 358 | issue = 21 | pages = 2231\u20139 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18441371 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa0802268 | url = http://cvrl.ioo.ucl.ac.uk/people/stockman/pubs/2008%20gene%20therapy%20b%20et%20al.pdf | publisher = [[Massachusetts Medical Society]] }}</ref> Leber's Congenital Amaurosis damages the light receptors in the retina and usually begins affecting sight in early childhood, with worsening vision until complete blindness around the age of 30.\n\nThe study used a common cold virus to deliver a normal version of the gene called [[RPE65]] directly into the eyes of affected patients. Remarkably, all 3 patients, aged 19, 22 and 25, responded well to the treatment and reported improved vision following the procedure. Due to the age of the patients and the degenerative nature of LCA, the improvement of vision in gene therapy patients is encouraging for researchers. It is hoped that gene therapy may be even more effective in younger LCA patients who have experienced limited vision loss, as well as in other blind or partially blind individuals.\n\nTwo experimental treatments for retinal problems include a cybernetic replacement and transplant of fetal retinal cells.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113968653 |title=Bionic Eye Opens New World Of Sight For Blind |first=Jon |last=Hamilton  | name-list-format = vanc |date=20 October 2009 |access-date=9 March 2019 |work=[[NPR]]}}</ref>\n\nThere is no high-quality evidence on the effect of assistive technologies on educational outcomes and quality of life in children with low vision as of 2015,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas R, Barker L, Rubin G, Dahlmann-Noor A | title = Assistive technology for children and young people with low vision | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 6 | pages = CD011350 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 26086876 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011350.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group }}</ref> nor is there evidence on magnifying reading aids in children.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Barker L, Thomas R, Rubin G, Dahlmann-Noor A | title = Optical reading aids for children and young people with low vision | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 3 | pages = CD010987 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25738963 | pmc = 6769181 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010987.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group }}</ref> Low-vision rehabilitation does not appear to have an important impact on health-related quality of life, though some low-vision rehabilitation interventions, particularly psychological therapies and methods of enhancing vision, may improve vision-related quality of life in people with sight loss.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van Nispen RM, Virgili G, Hoeben M, Langelaan M, Klevering J, Keunen JE, van Rens GH | title = Low vision rehabilitation for better quality of life in visually impaired adults | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 1 | pages = CD006543 | date = January 2020 | pmid = 31985055 | pmc = 6984642 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006543.pub2 | collaboration = Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group }}</ref>\n\n==Other animals==\n{{Main|Blindness in animals}}\nStatements that certain species of [[mammal]]s are \"born blind\" refers to them being born with their eyes closed and their eyelids fused together; the eyes open later. One example is the [[rabbit]]. In humans, the eyelids are fused for a while before birth, but open again before the normal birth time; however, very [[premature babies]] are sometimes born with their eyes fused shut, and opening later. Other animals, such as the [[blind mole rat]], are truly blind and rely on other senses.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nThe theme of blind animals has been a powerful one in literature. [[Peter Shaffer]]'s Tony Award-winning play, [[Equus (play)|''Equus'']], tells the story of a boy who blinds six horses. [[Theodore Taylor (author)|Theodore Taylor]]'s classic young adult novel, ''[[The Trouble With Tuck]]'', is about a teenage girl, Helen, who trains her blind dog to follow and trust a seeing-eye dog.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Acute visual loss]]\n*[[Blindness and education]]\n*[[Color blindness]]\n*[[Diplopia]]\n*[[Nyctalopia]]\n*[[Recovery from blindness]]\n*[[Stereoblindness]]\n*[[Tactile alphabet]]\n*[[Tactile graphic]]\n*[[Tangible symbol systems]]\n*[[Visual agnosia]]\n*[[Visual impairment due to intracranial pressure]]\n*[[World Blind Union]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category}}\n*{{dmoz|Health/Conditions_and_Diseases/Eye_Disorders/Blindness|Blindness}}\n* {{cite EB1911|wstitle=Blindness}}\n{{Medical condition classification and resources\n| ICD10 = {{ICD10|H|54|0|h|53}}, {{ICD10|H|54|1|h|53}}, {{ICD10|H|54|4|h|53}}\n| ICD9 = {{ICD9|369}}\n| MeSH=D001766\n| Width = 100\n| ICDO =\n| OMIM =\n| DiseasesDB = 28256\n| MedlinePlus =003040\n| eMedicineSubj =\n| eMedicineTopic =\n}}\n{{Eye pathology}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Visual impairment}}\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Blindness| ]]\n[[Category:Diseases of the eye and adnexa]]\n[[Category:RTT]]\n[[Category:RTTNEURO]]\n", "name_user": "188.141.10.131", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_impairment"}
