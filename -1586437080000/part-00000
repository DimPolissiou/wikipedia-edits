Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium enterprises ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]). Vietnam has become a leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for foreign investment in [[Southeast Asia]].

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 1987). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].</ref>\n\nThe separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing regional economic differences. In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956\u20131974 (in US$/year)\n!Year\n!1956\n!1958\n!1960\n!1962\n!1964\n!1966\n!1968\n!1970\n!1972\n!1974\n|-\n|[[Republic of Vietnam]]\n|62\n|88\n|105\n|100\n|118\n|100\n|85\n|81\n|90\n|65\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]\n|40\n|50\n|51\n|68\n|59\n|60\n|55\n|60\n|60\n|65\n|}\n\n=== 1976\u20131997 ===\nThe government's [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam#The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u201380)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976\u20131981) aimed for extraordinarily high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.

Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref> \n\nReminder: \n\nVietnam's occupation of Cambodia came after the defeating the Khmer er Rouge,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/khmer-rouge-topple-dominates-cambodian-politics-40-years-190106235355551.html|title=Khmer Rouge Topple Dominates Cambodian Politics 40 Years On|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> [[Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge|a genocidal regime supported by the United States.

The BTA provided for \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a [[manufacturing]]-based, [[export]]-oriented economy. Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but also from [[Europe]], Asia and other regions.\n\nIn 2001, the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] approved a 10-year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the primacy of the state.<ref name=\"cp\"/> Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global [[recession]], making it the world's second fastest-growing economy.

In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce. From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors \u2014 electronics, [[food processing]], cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods \u2014 experienced rapid growth. Benefits from its proximity to China with lower labor cost, Vietnam is becoming a new manufacturing hub in Asia, especially for Korean and Japanese firms.

The main destinations of Vietnam's exports were the [[United States]] (18.8%), [[Japan]] (13.2%), [[China]] (10.3%), [[Australia]] (6.9%), [[Singapore]] (5.2%), [[Germany]] (4.0%), and the [[United Kingdom]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn 2012, export rose 18.2%, valued at US$114.57 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/> Vietnam's main export market included the [[European Union|EU]] with US$20 billion, United States with US$19 billion, [[ASEAN]] with $US 17.8 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.9 billion, [[China]] with US$14.2 billion, and [[South Korea]] with US$7 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|title=T\u1ea1p ch\u00ed C\u1ed9ng S\u1ea3n - Xu\u1ea5t, nh\u1eadp kh\u1ea9u c\u1ee7a Vi\u1ec7t Nam n\u0103m 2012 - k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 nh\u1eefng v\u1ea5n \u0111\u1ec1 \u0111\u1eb7t ra|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106070648/http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|archivedate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, exports rose 15.4%, valued at US$132.17 billion, of which export of electronics now comprised 24.5% of total export, compared with a 4.4% in 2008. Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam. The [[United States]] continued to be Vietnam's largest export market, with US$28.5 billion. The [[EU]] is second with US$27.9 billion, [[ASEAN]] is third, [[China]] is fourth and [[Japan]] is the fifth largest export market of Vietnam.\n\n====Imports====\nIn 2004 Vietnam's merchandise [[import]]s were valued at US$31.5 billion, and growing rapidly. Vietnam's principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam's imports were China (13.9%), [[Taiwan]] (11.6%), [[Singapore]] (11.3%), [[Japan]] (11.1%), [[South Korea]] (10.4%), [[Thailand]] (5.8%), and [[Malaysia]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/>  Major import countries were [[China]] US$29.2 billion, [[ASEAN]] with US$22.3 billion, [[South Korea]] with US$16.2 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.7 billion, [[European Union|EU]] with US$10 billion, and United States with US$6.3 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\"/>\n\nIn 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are materials and machinery needed for export.

The [[ASEAN]] is second with US$23.1 billion, [[South Korea]] is third, [[Japan]] is fourth and the [[EU]] is the fifth largest import partner of Vietnam.\n\n===External debt, foreign aid and foreign investment===\n{{See also|Foreign aid to Vietnam}}\nIn 2004, external debt amounted to US$16.6 billion, or 37% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/444743/gross-domestic-product-gdp-per-capita-in-vietnam/|title=Vietnam- Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita 2020 - Statistic|author=|date=|website=Statista|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nFrom 1988 to December 2004, cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) commitments totaled US$46 billion. By December 2004, about 58% had been dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and [[Hanoi]]. In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and [[sustainable development]] and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of [[official development assistance]] (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hopes to receive US$14 billion to US$15 billion of ODA.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nPledged foreign direct investment US$21.3 billion for 2007 and a record US$31.6 billion for the first half of 2008.<ref name=\"IHT1\"/> Mergers and acquisitions have gradually become an important channel of investments in the economy, especially after 2005.\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n* [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] (AFTA)\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Australia\u2013New Zealand Free Trade Area]] (AANZFTA) is a free trade area between ASEAN and [[ANZCERTA]], signed on 27 February 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseansec.org/22255.htm|title=Welcome To The World Of Smokeless Cigarettes!|last=atinder|access-date=23 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527152141/http://www.aseansec.org/22255.htm|archivedate=27 May 2013}}</ref> and coming into effect on 1 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-01_2.4outcome_AANZFTA.pdf|title=ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand Leaders' Statement: Entry into Force of the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area 25 October 2009, Cha am Hua Hin, Thailand|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929174055/http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-01_2.4outcome_AANZFTA.pdf|archivedate=29 September 2015}}</ref> Details of the AANZFTA agreement are available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.fta.govt.nz/|title=ASEAN - Australia - New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) - ASEAN - Australia - New Zealand Free Trade Agreement|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013China Free Trade Area]] (ACFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\">{{Cite news| last = Pushpanathan | first = Sundram | title = ASEAN Charter: One year and going strong | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/12/22/asean-charter-one-year-and-going-strong.html | work = [[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 22 December 2009 | accessdate = 1 January 2010}}</ref>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013India Free Trade Area]] (AIFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\"/>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership]] (AJCEP)\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Korea Free Trade Area]] (AKFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\"/>\n* [[Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia]]\n* [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]].\n* On 29 May 2015, Vietnam signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with [[Eurasian Economic Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/vietnam-new-trade-agreement-with-eurasia-economic-union/|title=Vietnam: New Trade Agreement with Eurasia Economic Union - Global Legal Monitor|author=|date=16 June 2015|website=www.LOC.gov|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n* On 2 December 2015, the EU and Vietnam announced the conclusion of the negotiations for an EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).<ref>{{cite web|title=Vietnam|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/vietnam/|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Vietnam-Chile Free Trade Agreement]] (VCFTA) came into effect on 1 January 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/190-vietnam-chile/1|title=Vietnam - Chile - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513212731/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/concluded/vietnam-chile|archive-date=2017-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Vietnam-Korea Free Trade Agreement]] (VKFTA) came into effect on 20 December 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/189-vietnam-south-korea/1|title=Vietnam - Korea - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520075539/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/negotiations/vietnam-korea|archive-date=2017-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Japan-Vietnam Economic Partnership Agreement]] came into effect on 1 October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/187-vietnam-japan/1|title=Vietnam - Japan - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513212740/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/concluded/vietnam-japan|archive-date=2017-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Economic development strategy==\n===Guiding principle===\n====Industrialization and Modernization (IM)====\n''\u201cIndustrialization and modernization is a process of fundamental and all-rounded change of production, business, services and social and economic management from the predominant use of artisanal labor to a predominant use of labor power17 with technology, methods and ways of working that are advanced, modern and rely upon the development of industry and scientific \u2013 technical progress to create high labor productivity. So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so that a common framework can be set forward.\n\n==Economic indicators and international rankings==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Over that period, the economy has experienced rapid growth. In the 21st century, Vietnam is in a period of being integrated into the global economy. Almost all Vietnamese enterprises are small and medium enterprises ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]). Vietnam has become a leading agricultural exporter and served as an attractive destination for foreign investment in [[Southeast Asia]].

The feudal dynasties always considered [[agriculture]] as the main economic base, and their economic thoughts have been predicated on [[physiocracy]]. Land ownership was regulated, and such large-scale works as [[Dike (construction)|dykes]] were constructed in the [[Red River Delta]] to facilitate wet rice cultivation. In peaceful times, soldiers were sent home to do farm work. Furthermore, the court prohibited slaughtering water buffalo and cattle and held many agriculture-related ceremonies. Handicrafts and art were valued, but commerce was deprecated, and businessmen were called by the derogatory term ''con bu\u00f4n''. The national economy was self-sufficient.\n\nFrom the 16th century, [[Confucianism]] was losing its influence on Vietnamese society and a monetary economy began to develop. Early commercial ports, such as [[H\u1ed9i An]], were constrained, and foreign countries with their different cultures and their invasion ambitions were seen as a threat. This policy of closure led to a degree of stagnation in the Vietnamese economy, and contributed to Vietnam becoming a French colony.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== 1858\u20131975 ===\nUntil the [[French Indochina|French colonization]] in the mid-19th century, Vietnam's economy had been mostly agrarian, subsistence-based and village-oriented. French colonizers, however, deliberately developed the regions differently as the French needed raw materials and a market for French manufactured goods, designating the [[Cochinchina|South]] for agricultural production as it was better suited for agriculture, and the [[Tonkin|North]] for manufacturing as it was naturally wealthy in mineral resources. Though the plan exaggerated regional divisions, the development of exports\u2014coal from the North, rice from the South\u2014and the importation of French manufactured goods stimulated domestic commerce.<ref name=\"cs\">[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html Vietnam country study]. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (December 1987). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].</ref>\n\nThe separation distorted the basic Vietnamese economy by overly stressing regional economic differences. In the South, while irrigated rice remained the principal subsistence crop, the French introduced plantation agriculture with products such as tea, cotton, and tobacco. The colonial government also developed some extractive industries, such as the mining of coal, iron, and nonferrous metals. A shipbuilding industry was begun in Hanoi;  railroads, roads, power stations, and hydraulics works were constructed. In the South, agricultural development concentrated on rice cultivation, and, nationally, rice and rubber were the main items of export. Domestic and foreign trade were centered around the Saigon-Cholon area. Industry in the South consisted mostly of food-processing plants and factories producing consumer goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/47.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy - Historical Background|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhen the North and South were divided [[Geneva Conference (1954)|politically]] in 1954, they also adopted different economic ideologies: communism in the North and capitalism in the South. Destruction caused by the [[Second Indochina War]] from 1954 to 1975 seriously strained the economy. The situation was worsened by the country's 1.5 million military and civilian deaths, and the subsequent exodus of 1 million refugees, including tens of thousands of professionals, intellectuals, technicians and skilled workers.<ref name=\"cs\"/>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+GDP per capita in Vietnam, 1956\u20131974 (in US$/year)\n!Year\n!1956\n!1958\n!1960\n!1962\n!1964\n!1966\n!1968\n!1970\n!1972\n!1974\n|-\n|[[Republic of Vietnam]]\n|62\n|88\n|105\n|100\n|118\n|100\n|85\n|81\n|90\n|65\n|-\n|[[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]]\n|40\n|50\n|51\n|68\n|59\n|60\n|55\n|60\n|60\n|65\n|}\n\n=== 1976\u20131997 ===\nThe government's [[Five-Year Plans of Vietnam#The Second Five-Year Plan (1976\u201380)|Second Five-Year Plan]] (1976\u20131981) aimed for extraordinarily high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2017}} annual growth rates in industrial and agricultural sectors and national income and sought to integrate the North and the South, but the goals were not attained.

Vietnam is one of the few countries in modern history to experience a sharp economic deterioration in a postwar reconstruction period. Its peacetime economy was one of the poorest in the world and had shown a negative to very slow growth in total national output as well as in agricultural and industrial production. Vietnam's gross domestic product ( GDP) in 1984 was valued at US$18.1 billion with a per capita income estimated to be between US$200 and US$300 per year. Reasons for this mediocre economic performance have included severe climatic conditions that afflicted agricultural crops, bureaucratic mismanagement, elimination of private ownership, extinction of entrepreneurial classes in the South, and military occupation of Cambodia (which resulted in a cutoff of much-needed international aid for reconstruction).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/vietnam/45.htm|title=Vietnam - The Economy|access-date=3 March 2015}}</ref> \n\nRegarding the above, please note, \n\nVietnam's occupation of Cambodia came after the defeated Cambodia's \n\nKhmer Rouge,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/khmer-rouge-topple-dominates-cambodian-politics-40-years-190106235355551.html|title=Khmer Rouge Topple Dominates Cambodian Politics 40 Years On|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> [[Allegations of United States support for the Khmer Rouge|a genocidal regime supported by the United States.]] Subsequently, in a petty display, after having lost twice to Vietnam:\n\n\"[The United States].... employed its ''de facto'' veto at the World Bank, IMF, and Asian Development Bank in order to block all multilateral financial lending to [Vietnam].\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFrom the late 1970s until the early 1990s, Vietnam was a member of the [[Comecon]], and therefore was heavily dependent on trade with the [[Soviet Union]] and its allies.

The BTA provided for \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status of Vietnamese goods in the U.S. market. It was expected that access to the U.S. market would allow Vietnam to hasten its transformation into a [[manufacturing]]-based, [[export]]-oriented economy. Furthermore, it would attract foreign investment, not only from the U.S., but also from [[Europe]], Asia and other regions.\n\nIn 2001, the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] approved a 10-year economic plan that enhanced the role of the private sector, while reaffirming the primacy of the state.<ref name=\"cp\"/> Growth then rose to 6% to 7% between 2000 and 2002 even in the midst of the global [[recession]], making it the world's second fastest-growing economy.

In 2000, 22.4% of industrial production was attributable to non-state activities. From 1994 to 2004, the industrial sector grew at an average annual rate of 10.3%. Manufacturing contributed 20.3% of GDP in 2004, while employing 10.2% of the workforce. From 1994 to 2004, manufacturing GDP grew at an average annual rate of 11.2%. The top manufacturing sectors \u2014 electronics, [[food processing]], cigarettes and tobacco, textiles, chemicals, and footwear goods \u2014 experienced rapid growth. Benefits from its proximity to China with lower labor cost, Vietnam is becoming a new manufacturing hub in Asia, especially for Korean and Japanese firms.

The main destinations of Vietnam's exports were the [[United States]] (18.8%), [[Japan]] (13.2%), [[China]] (10.3%), [[Australia]] (6.9%), [[Singapore]] (5.2%), [[Germany]] (4.0%), and the [[United Kingdom]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nIn 2012, export rose 18.2%, valued at US$114.57 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/> Vietnam's main export market included the [[European Union|EU]] with US$20 billion, United States with US$19 billion, [[ASEAN]] with $US 17.8 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.9 billion, [[China]] with US$14.2 billion, and [[South Korea]] with US$7 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|title=T\u1ea1p ch\u00ed C\u1ed9ng S\u1ea3n - Xu\u1ea5t, nh\u1eadp kh\u1ea9u c\u1ee7a Vi\u1ec7t Nam n\u0103m 2012 - k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 v\u00e0 nh\u1eefng v\u1ea5n \u0111\u1ec1 \u0111\u1eb7t ra|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106070648/http://www.tapchicongsan.org.vn/Home/kinh-te-thi-truong-XHCN/2012/19289/Xuat-nhap-khau-cua-Viet-Nam-nam-2012-ket-qua-va.aspx|archivedate=6 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, exports rose 15.4%, valued at US$132.17 billion, of which export of electronics now comprised 24.5% of total export, compared with a 4.4% in 2008. Textiles and garments are still an important part in Vietnam's export, valued about US$17.9 billion in 2013.\n\nIn 2014, exports rose 13.6%, reaching US$150.1 billion. Electronics and electronics parts, textiles and garments, computers and computer parts are the three main export groups of Vietnam. The [[United States]] continued to be Vietnam's largest export market, with US$28.5 billion. The [[EU]] is second with US$27.9 billion, [[ASEAN]] is third, [[China]] is fourth and [[Japan]] is the fifth largest export market of Vietnam.\n\n====Imports====\nIn 2004 Vietnam's merchandise [[import]]s were valued at US$31.5 billion, and growing rapidly. Vietnam's principal imports were machinery (17.5%), refined petroleum (11.5%), steel (8.3%), material for the textile industry (7.2%), and cloth (6.0%). The main origins of Vietnam's imports were China (13.9%), [[Taiwan]] (11.6%), [[Singapore]] (11.3%), [[Japan]] (11.1%), [[South Korea]] (10.4%), [[Thailand]] (5.8%), and [[Malaysia]] (3.8%).<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nVietnam import rose 6.6% in 2012, valued at US$113.79 billion.<ref name=\"dailytimes.com.pk\"/>  Major import countries were [[China]] US$29.2 billion, [[ASEAN]] with US$22.3 billion, [[South Korea]] with US$16.2 billion, [[Japan]] with US$13.7 billion, [[European Union|EU]] with US$10 billion, and United States with US$6.3 billion.<ref name=\"tapchicongsan.org.vn\"/>\n\nIn 2014, imports rose 12.1%, reaching US$148 billion, most of which are materials and machinery needed for export.

The [[ASEAN]] is second with US$23.1 billion, [[South Korea]] is third, [[Japan]] is fourth and the [[EU]] is the fifth largest import partner of Vietnam.\n\n===External debt, foreign aid and foreign investment===\n{{See also|Foreign aid to Vietnam}}\nIn 2004, external debt amounted to US$16.6 billion, or 37% of GDP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/444743/gross-domestic-product-gdp-per-capita-in-vietnam/|title=Vietnam- Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita 2020 - Statistic|author=|date=|website=Statista|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nFrom 1988 to December 2004, cumulative foreign direct investment (FDI) commitments totaled US$46 billion. By December 2004, about 58% had been dispersed. About half of FDI has been directed at the two major cities (and environs) of Ho Chi Minh City and [[Hanoi]]. In 2003 new foreign direct investment commitments were US$1.5 billion. The largest sector by far for licensed FDI is industry and [[construction]]. Other sectors attracting FDI are oil and gas, fisheries, construction, agriculture and forestry, transportation and communications, and hotels and tourism. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hoped to receive US$18 billion of FDI to support a targeted growth rate in excess of 7%. Despite rising investments, foreign investors still regard Vietnam as a risky destination, as confirmed by recent survey by the [[Japan External Trade Organization]] of Japanese companies operating in Vietnam. Many of the respondents complained about high costs of utilities, office rentals and skilled labor. Corruption, bureaucracy, lack of transparent regulations and the failure to enforce investor rights are additional obstacles to investment, according to the U.S. State Department. Vietnam tied with several nations for the 102nd place in Transparencies International's Corruption Perceptions Index in 2004.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nThe [[World Bank]]'s assistance program for Vietnam has three objectives: to support Vietnam's transition to a market economy, to enhance equitable and [[sustainable development]] and to promote good governance. From 1993 through 2004, Vietnam received pledges of US$29 billion of [[official development assistance]] (ODA), of which about US$14 billion, or 49%, has been disbursed. In 2004, international donors pledged ODA of US$2.25 billion, of which US$1.65 billion actually was disbursed. Three donors accounted for 80% of disbursements in 2004: Japan, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank. From 2006 to 2010, Vietnam hopes to receive US$14 billion to US$15 billion of ODA.<ref name=\"cp\"/>\n\nPledged foreign direct investment US$21.3 billion for 2007 and a record US$31.6 billion for the first half of 2008.<ref name=\"IHT1\"/> Mergers and acquisitions have gradually become an important channel of investments in the economy, especially after 2005.\n\n===Free trade agreements===\n* [[ASEAN Free Trade Area]] (AFTA)\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Australia\u2013New Zealand Free Trade Area]] (AANZFTA) is a free trade area between ASEAN and [[ANZCERTA]], signed on 27 February 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aseansec.org/22255.htm|title=Welcome To The World Of Smokeless Cigarettes!|last=atinder|access-date=23 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527152141/http://www.aseansec.org/22255.htm|archivedate=27 May 2013}}</ref> and coming into effect on 1 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-01_2.4outcome_AANZFTA.pdf|title=ASEAN, Australia and New Zealand Leaders' Statement: Entry into Force of the Agreement Establishing the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area 25 October 2009, Cha am Hua Hin, Thailand|access-date=3 March 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929174055/http://www.15thaseansummit-th.org/PDF/25-01_2.4outcome_AANZFTA.pdf|archivedate=29 September 2015}}</ref> Details of the AANZFTA agreement are available online.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asean.fta.govt.nz/|title=ASEAN - Australia - New Zealand Free Trade Agreement (AANZFTA) - ASEAN - Australia - New Zealand Free Trade Agreement|accessdate=3 March 2015}}</ref>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013China Free Trade Area]] (ACFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\">{{Cite news| last = Pushpanathan | first = Sundram | title = ASEAN Charter: One year and going strong | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/12/22/asean-charter-one-year-and-going-strong.html | work = [[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 22 December 2009 | accessdate = 1 January 2010}}</ref>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013India Free Trade Area]] (AIFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\"/>\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership]] (AJCEP)\n* [[ASEAN\u2013Korea Free Trade Area]] (AKFTA), in effect as of 1 January 2010<ref name=\"Pushpanathan\"/>\n* [[Comprehensive Economic Partnership for East Asia]]\n* [[Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership]].\n* On 29 May 2015, Vietnam signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with [[Eurasian Economic Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/vietnam-new-trade-agreement-with-eurasia-economic-union/|title=Vietnam: New Trade Agreement with Eurasia Economic Union - Global Legal Monitor|author=|date=16 June 2015|website=www.LOC.gov|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n* On 2 December 2015, the EU and Vietnam announced the conclusion of the negotiations for an EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (FTA).<ref>{{cite web|title=Vietnam|url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/vietnam/|accessdate=19 December 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Vietnam-Chile Free Trade Agreement]] (VCFTA) came into effect on 1 January 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/190-vietnam-chile/1|title=Vietnam - Chile - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513212731/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/concluded/vietnam-chile|archive-date=2017-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Vietnam-Korea Free Trade Agreement]] (VKFTA) came into effect on 20 December 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/189-vietnam-south-korea/1|title=Vietnam - Korea - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520075539/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/negotiations/vietnam-korea|archive-date=2017-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* [[Japan-Vietnam Economic Partnership Agreement]] came into effect on 1 October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wtocenter.vn/fta/187-vietnam-japan/1|title=Vietnam - Japan - WTO and International trade Policies|website=WTOCenter.vn|access-date=5 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170513212740/http://wtocenter.vn/fta/concluded/vietnam-japan|archive-date=2017-05-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Economic development strategy==\n===Guiding principle===\n====Industrialization and Modernization (IM)====\n''\u201cIndustrialization and modernization is a process of fundamental and all-rounded change of production, business, services and social and economic management from the predominant use of artisanal labor to a predominant use of labor power17 with technology, methods and ways of working that are advanced, modern and rely upon the development of industry and scientific \u2013 technical progress to create high labor productivity. So from a theoretical and practical view industrialization and modernization are a necessary historical process that Vietnam must go through change our country into an industrial country [\u2026]\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n====Socialist-Oriented Market Economy (SOME)====\n''\u201cThe nature of a socialist-oriented market economy in our country:\n\u2022\tIt is not an economy managed according in the style of a centralized bureaucratic subsidized system\n\u2022\tIt is not a free market capitalist economy\n\u2022\tIt is not yet entirely a socialist-oriented economy. This is because our country is in the period of transition to socialism, and there is still a mixture of, and a struggle between, the old and the new, so there simultaneously are, and are not yet sufficiently, socialist factors\u201d''\n\n-7th National Congress-Central Committee (1991)\n\n===Development strategy===\n====Trade liberalization====\nOver the past 30 years, Vietnam has signed numerous trade agreements with different partners, promoting the country as one of the main manufacturing hubs in the world. In 1995, Vietnam joined the ASEAN community. In 2000, it signed a free trade agreement with the United States, to be followed by admission to the World Trade Organisation in 2007. Since then, the country has further integrated itself into the world economy with bilateral agreements with other ASEAN countries, China, India, Japan, and Korea, to name a few. Vietnam has actively working with other partners on ratifying the Trans-Pacific Partnership to form CP TPP, or TPP-11, after the withdrawal of the US, in order to promote economic cooperation, regional connectivity and promote economic growth between member countries. The World Bank estimates that the CP TPP would help the country's GDP to grow by 1.1% by 2030 with a boost to productivity. The overall impact of these efforts was the lowering of tariffs on both imports and exports to and from Viet Nam, and an improved trade balance with a surplus of $2.8 billion during the first eight months of 2018 (Vietnam Custom Department).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.customs.gov.vn/Lists/ThongKeHaiQuan/Default.aspx|title=Chuy\u00ean trang Th\u1ed1ng k\u00ea H\u1ea3i quan :: H\u1ea3i quan Vi\u1ec7t Nam|website=www.customs.gov.vn}}</ref> Most recently, on June 30, 2019, Vietnam signed the Free Trade Agreement and Investment Protection Agreement with the EU after 10 years of negotiation, making it only the fourth country in Asia which managed to sign such agreement with the western bloc (after Japan, South Korea, and Singapore)\n\n====Domestic reform====\nThe government has made real effort in changing its mindset toward a more open market economy, lowering the cost of doing business, and putting regulation in place to ensure rights and orders. In 1986 the government passed its first Law on Foreign Investment, allowing foreign companies to operate in Vietnam. The constitution has come a long way since, with the law being revised regularly to cater for a more investor-friendly business environment while aiming to reduce red-tape and accelerate foreign investment into the country. The Global Competitiveness Report<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-global-competitiveness-report-2017-2018/|title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2017-2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by World Economic Forum placed Vietnam at 55th in 2017, rising from 77th place in 2006 . In the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business rankings,<ref>http://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Annual-Reports/English/DB2018-Full-Report.pdf</ref> Viet Nam also rose from 104th place in 2007 to 68th place in 2017. The Bank commended Vietnam on progress made in enforcing contracts, increasing access to credit and basic infrastructure, and trading, among other factors.\n\n====Human and physical capital investment====\nVietnam invested a lot in its human capital and infrastructure. With a growing population \u2013 96 million today, up from 60 million in 1986, and more than half are under the age of 35\u2013 Vietnam made large public investments in education, especially making primary education universal and compulsory. This was necessary, given the country's export-led growth strategy, where literacy for the mass workforce is deemed important for growth in the manufacturing sector. On the other hand, Vietnam also invested heavily in infrastructure, ensuring cheap mass access to necessity like electricity, water, and especially the internet. These two factors together helped Vietnam to become a hub for foreign investment and manufacturing in Southeast Asia. Japanese and Korean electronics companies like Samsung, LG, Olympus, and Pioneer built factories, and countless European and American apparel makers set up textile operation in the country. Intel opened a $1 billion chip factory in 2010, signalling the importance of Vietnam's strategic positioning in the eyes of international business community.\n\n====Sustainable growth====\nCompare to other developing countries, the economic growth in Vietnam was considered to be fairly inclusive and equitable. The Inclusive Development Index<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-inclusive-development-index-2018/|title=The Inclusive Development Index 2018|website=World Economic Forum}}</ref> by WEF put Vietnam in a group of countries that have done particularly well and advancing in the ranking of the world's most inclusive economies. This has been notably evident with the role of women participating in the economy. Their labor force participation rate is within 10% of that of men, a smaller gap than many other countries according to World Bank, and in 2015 women-led households are generally not poorer than those led by men. Primary and secondary enrollment rates for boys and girls are also essentially the same, and more girls continue studying in high school than boys. The government is actively reviewing and adjusting its policy, as shown in the current official Development Strategy Action Plan 2011-2020, to develop appropriate mechanisms for a more equitable growth across the country; promoting the advantages of each regions, working in collaboration with each other to support and amplify the fruit of development.\n\nIn 2017, with the help of the United Nations, Vietnam official started the ground work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals with the development of the \"One Strategic Plan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.opendevelopmentmekong.net/topics/sustainable-development-goals/|title=Sustainable Development Goals}}</ref> integrating the SDGs with the nation's Socio-Economic Development Strategy (2011-2020) and Socio-Economic Development Plan (2016-2020). The OSP can be used as a guideline for government agencies to implement the SDGs in the most effective ways, focusing on areas of importance, such as: investing in people, climate resilience and environmental sustainability, prosperity and partnership, justice and inclusive governance. Vietnam has also developed a National Action Plan to review current growth policies and update these to align with the interest of the SDGs. This is done in consultation with ministries, local governments, and other stakeholders so that a common framework can be set forward.\n\n==Economic indicators and international rankings==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He had one sibling, his brother Art, who was born on July 10, 1904. Their father John was an engineer who built railroad tunnels and trestles for the [[Denver & Rio Grande]], and he taught his sons about drafting and layout. They both worked for the railroad when they were not in school.<ref>Ball 1998, pp. 22\u201323.</ref>\n\nAl's initial interest in airplane design began while still in grade school and continued to grow as he progressed to high school.

Finally, Al got the chance to build the M-1, also known as the Long Wing Eaglerock, a plane of his own design.  While the airplane had some success as a trainer, its success was not enough to keep him at the Alexander company.  In 1926, after spending some time working for Montague, where he designed his M-2, Al started taking his first flying lessons.  Eventually, after the financial demise of Montegue, Al returned to Alexander.<ref name=\"ams\"/>  In 1928, he became the chief engineer at Alexander.<ref name=\"ams\"/>  During the time as chief engineer, he was responsible for several advances in the field of aircraft design, primarily through design of the Bullet, which was a low-\nwing airplane with relatively high speeds and a patented retractable landing gear.<ref name=\"pilotfriend\"/>\n\n==Production years==\n\n===The first Mooney Aircraft Company===\nIn 1929, with the financial backing of the Bridgeport Machine Co.,<ref name=\"ams\"/> Al left the Alexander Aircraft Corporation.  Along with his brother Arthur, they moved to [[Wichita, Kansas]], where they started the [[Mooney Aircraft Corporation]].  The early years of the Mooney Corporation were spent designing the Mooney A-1, which had similar characteristics to the Bullet which Al had designed earlier, and the M-5.<ref name=\"pilotfriend\"/>  Within seven months of startup, the design of Al's M-5 had progressed from the drawing board to test flights.  With the aircraft industry sales on the decline due to the onset of the great depression, Al attempted to fly the M-5 nonstop from [[Glendale, California]], to [[Long Island, New York]], as a promotional feat.  However, the nonstop flight failed near [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], when his engine quit due to faulty welding on the fuel pump.<ref name=\"ams\"/>  In 1931, with the failing economy, the Mooney Corporation closed its doors.<ref name=\"pilotfriend\"/>\n\nIn the time after the liquidation of the Mooney Aircraft Company, Al continued to pursue aircraft design.  His next design began as drawings for a new plane, the M-6, which sported a two-place low-wing design.  However, development came to a halt with financial difficulty that prevented the purchasing of an engine.  After several years of searching for financing and continuing design, the M-6 fell through the cracks and never made production.<ref name=\"ams\"/>\n\n===Bellanca and Culver===\nWhile most of the aircraft industry was in shambles in the middle of the great depression, the [[AviaBellanca Aircraft|Bellanca]] aircraft company had some continued success due to contracts with the navy and the company's popularity among Alaskan bush pilots. In 1934, Mooney took a job as the chief engineer at Bellanca.<ref name=\"pilotfriend\"/> During this period, Mooney worked closely with the owner, the well-respected [[Giuseppe Bellanca]]. In his time at Bellanca, Mooney was responsible for the designs of the [[Bellanca Airbus]] cargo plane and the racer ''[[Irish Swoop]]''.<ref name=\"ams\"/>\n\nAfter his time with Bellanca, Mooney went briefly to [[Monocoupe Corporation]]. Working with the small startup company, he designed the [[Culver Dart|Model G Dart]] and the [[Monocoach]].<ref name=\"pilotfriend\"/> In his time with Monocoupe, several features of future Mooney aircraft were designed. These enhancements included rubber shock biscuits and a spring-assisted manual gear.<ref name=\"ams\"/> After Monocoupe went under due to financial distress, Mooney's designs were purchased by [[Culver Aircraft]].\n\nIn 1937, Mooney joined Culver as chief engineer. In his days at Culver before [[World War II]], he was responsible for the design of the Culver Cadet acrobatic plane which had a production of over 350 models.<ref name=\"pilotfriend\"/> By the 1940s, Culver's main focus shifted towards military drones, in which Mooney had little interest. During this time, Mooney started a business relationship with Al Yankey, which eventually led to the founding of a second Mooney Aircraft. As Culver's commercial sales began to slow down with the end of the war, and the tough competition from the [[Cessna 120]], Mooney left the company.<ref name=\"ams\"/>\n\n===The second Mooney Aircraft Company===\n[[File:MooneyM-18CMiteN4057.jpg|left|thumb|175px|An M-18 Mooney Mite]]\nIn July 1946, with the partnership of C.G. Yankey and W.L. McMahon, Al and Art resurrected the Mooney Aircraft Corporation. In the new company, Al took the position of general manager and chief engineer.<ref name=\"pilotfriend\"/> The first aircraft produced was the M-18, a single-place retractable gear aircraft, and the first of its kind available on the market after World War II; it was later named the [[Mooney Mite M-18|Mite]].<ref name=\"ams\"/> After some problems with engine selection and the decision to replace them, Al started design on his next aircraft, the M-20. The M-20 he envisioned was a four-place design with the eventual capability to convert to metal manufacturing. in 1953, the corporation's main financial backer, Al Yankey, died of a stroke before proper funding had been set up for Al's M-20. With the company again in financial distress, it was taken over by Hal Rachal and Norm Hoffman. Only two years after the first prototype flight of the M-20, and in the wake of Yankey's death followed by the company's takeover, Al left the Mooney Aircraft Company and started working at Lockheed.<ref name=\"ams\"/>\n\n==The later years==\n\n===Lockheed===\nAfter leaving the Mooney Aircraft Company, a company in which he had no ownership, though it carried his name, he moved to Lockheed, where he spent the rest of his career.  In his time with Lockheed, his aircraft designs continued with a proposal that eventually became the [[Lockheed Jetstar]].  Other designs credited to him include the [[Aermacchi AL-60|AL-60]] and another unnamed Lockheed business jet.<ref name=\"ams\"/>\n\n===Retirement===\nIn 1964, while Al was designing his final aircraft, a benign tumor was found in his wife Opie.  This was the beginning of a decline in her health, ending with her death in 1966.  His initial response to her death was to lose himself in his work.  However, when his older brother Art retired in 1967, he realized that he was no longer enjoying his work, and retired in 1968.  On 7 May 1986 in [[Dallas, Texas]], Al died at the age of 80.<ref name=\"ams\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Ball|first=Larry A.|title=Those Remarkable Mooneys|publisher=Ball Publications|location=Indianapolis|year=1998|isbn=0-9641514-9-9}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mooney}}\n[[Category:1906 births]]\n[[Category:1986 deaths]]\n[[Category:Aviation pioneers]]\n[[Category:American aviation businesspeople]]\n[[Category:People from Denver]]\n[[Category:Aircraft designers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American businesspeople]]\n", "text_old": "{{Dablink|\"Albert Mooney\" is also a character in the Irish folk-song \"[[I'll Tell Me Ma]]\".}}\n{{Infobox person\n|name=Albert W.

In the new company, Al took the position of general manager and chief engineer.<ref name=\"pilotfriend\"/> The first aircraft produced was the M-18, a single-place retractable gear aircraft, and the first of its kind available on the market after World War II; it was later named the [[Mooney Mite M-18|Mite]].<ref name=\"ams\"/> After some problems with engine selection and the decision to replace them, Al started design on his next aircraft, the M-20. The M-20 he envisioned was a four-place design with the eventual capability to convert to metal manufacturing. in 1953, the corporation's main financial backer, Al Yankey, died of a stroke before proper funding had been set up for Al's M-20. With the company again in financial distress, it was taken over by Hal Rachal and Norm Hoffman. Only two years after the first prototype flight of the M-20, and in the wake of Yankey's death followed by the company's takeover, Al left the Mooney Aircraft Company and started working at Lockheed.<ref name=\"ams\"/>\n\n==The later years==\n\n===Lockheed===\nAfter leaving the Mooney Aircraft Company, a company in which he had no ownership, though it carried his name, he moved to Lockheed, where he spent the rest of his career.  In his time with Lockheed, his aircraft designs continued with a proposal that eventually became the [[Lockheed Jetstar]].  Other designs credited to him include the [[Aermacchi AL-60|AL-60]] and another unnamed Lockheed business jet.<ref name=\"ams\"/>\n\n===Retirement===\nIn 1964, while Al was designing his final aircraft, a benign tumor was found in his wife Opie.  This was the beginning of a decline in her health, ending with her death in 1966.  His initial response to her death was to lose himself in his work.  However, when his older brother Art retired in 1967, he realized that he was no longer enjoying his work, and retired in 1968.  On 7 May 1986 in [[Dallas, Texas]], Al died at the age of 80.<ref name=\"ams\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book|last=Ball|first=Larry A.|title=Those Remarkable Mooneys|publisher=Ball Publications|location=Indianapolis|year=1998|isbn=0-9641514-9-9}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mooney}}\n[[Category:1906 births]]\n[[Category:1986 deaths]]\n[[Category:Aviation pioneers]]\n[[Category:American aviation businesspeople]]\n[[Category:People from Denver]]\n[[Category:Aircraft designers]]\n[[Category:20th-century American businesspeople]]\n", "name_user": "Martha.Mooney", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added self taught because My grandfather earned that description", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Mooney"}
