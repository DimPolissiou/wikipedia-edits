The institute was transferred to its present campus at [[Tejgaon]] Industrial Area in Dhaka in 1960.\n\n===College of Textile Engineering and Technology===\n\nIn the year of 1978, the institute launched a four-year period [[bachelor's degree]] program in Textile Technology by affiliation with the [[University of Dhaka]] and was upgraded into a college renaming it as College of Textile Engineering & Technology. Initially, intake was only 60 per year and since the introduction of bachelor's degree course, more than 2,800 textile engineers and technologists had graduated from this institution.\n\nThe erstwhile College of Textile Engineering & Technology had been an economically important institute under the administrative control of the [[Ministry of Education]] through Directorate of Technical Education which offered BSc in Textile Technology/BSc in Textile Engineering/BSc in Textile Management courses as a constituent college of the [[University of Dhaka]].\n\n===Birth of BUTEX===\n\nThe [[Bangladesh textile industry]] is the most important industrial sector as more than 83% of export earnings comes from this sector. Equipping the textile industry with qualified manpower with updated technical knowledge, expertise and skill is essential in building the appropriate backward linkages at the shortest possible time to face the challenges of quota-free post-MFA period.\n\nConsidering the importance of textile education and research, the government of Bangladesh took initiatives to upgrade the College of Textile Engineering & Technology to a university. For this purpose, \"Bangladesh Textile University Act, 2010\" (Act no. 49, 2010) was passed by the Bangladesh National Assembly and the Honorable President gave consent to the act on 5 October 2010.

formation in 1909. It followed the [[1913 Auckland Rugby League season]] where [[North Shore Albions]] were crowned senior champions for the first time. The senior grade saw the addition of [[Otahuhu Leopards|Otahuhu]], who had previously competed in the lower grades only, and [[Grafton Athletic]]. The [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] and [[Eden Ramblers]] no longer contributed teams. The first grade was won once again by [[North Shore Albions]].\n\nAt a meeting of [[Auckland Rugby League]] on 9 May it was decided that the proceeds of ticket sales at club games would be split 50\u201350 between the teams and [[Auckland Rugby League]].<ref>{{cite news|url= https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140511.2.8.1|title=FOOTBALL.

It proceeded to the [[Auckland Domain]] where a 3rd grade match was being played between Remuera and [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]] 3rd Grade teams, and a \u2018Burlesque\u2019 football game was then played.

The [[Apex (mollusc)|apex]] is obtuse. The whorls are very slightly convex, with a well-marked suture, and a broad flat or very slightly convex area below the suture occupying a little less than half the breadth of the whorls. Below the sutural band, the whorls are more markedly convex owing to the presence of smooth oblique nodosities, which number from about ten to thirteen or fourteen to the whorl, usually with thirteen on the penultimate whorl. The shell is otherwise smooth showing the lines of growth only very faintly. The aperture is narrow-ovate, with a broad shallow sinus fully occupying the flat area below the suture. The breadth of the sinus is somewhat detracted from by the presence of a large and prominent tubercle on the columellar side. The [[Columella (gastropod)|columella]] is white and slightly twisted. The anterior canal is very short, but relatively rather broad. The outer [[Lip (gastropod)|lip]] is thin at the margin and smooth within. The colour of the shell is white, creamy, or light brown.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/proceedingsofroy12roya Pritchard, G.B. & Gatliff, J.H. 1899. ''On some new species of Victorian mollusca''.
