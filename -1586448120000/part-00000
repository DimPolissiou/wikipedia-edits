The detaining authority passes the order of detention on subjective satisfaction\u2026 To prevent misuse of this potentially dangerous power the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed and meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards, however technical, is, in our opinion, mandatory and vital.\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rekha vs State Of T.Nadu |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/192877/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Lack of SOPs ====\n\nAn RTI application to the J&K Home Department filed by members of the J&K RTI Movement revealed that the State Government of J&K has not made any Rules or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under PSA, during the four decades of its existence.<ref name=\"SOP\">{{cite web |title=NO RULES, SOPS FOR ORDERING PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS UNDER J&K PSA |url=https://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/blog/no-rules-sops-for-ordering-preventive-detentions-under-jk-psa |website=HRI |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nEvery year the detaining authorities have been issuing hundreds and at times thousands of detention orders without any SOPs to guide them except the reports and dossiers prepared by the J&K Police.<ref name=\"SOP\"/>\n\n\n==== Failure to Scrutinize Evidence ====\n\nIn an interview with Amnesty International, a former District Magistrate said that the Magistrates do not have dedicated assistance available, which could verify and seriously examine the police version, thus the District Magistrate as to necessarily rely on the reports filed by the police.
