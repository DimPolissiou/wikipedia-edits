In 1946, he graduated from the ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' (high school) and began university studies in industrial [[chemistry]]. Initially, Markov worked as a [[chemical engineer]] and a [[teacher]] in a technical school. At the age of 19 years he became ill with [[tuberculosis]] which forced him to attend various hospitals. His first literary attempts occurred during that time. In 1957, a novel, ''The Night of Caesium'', appeared. Soon another novel, ''The Ajax Winners'' (1959), and two collections of short stories (1961) were published. In 1962, Markov published the novel ''Men'' which won the annual award of the Union of Bulgarian Writers and he was subsequently accepted as a member of the Union, a prerequisite for a professional career in [[literature]]. Georgi Markov started working at the Narodna Mladezh Publishing house. The story collections ''A Portrait of My Double'' (1966) and ''The Women of Warsaw'' (1968) secured his place as one of the most talented young writers of Bulgaria. Markov also wrote a number of plays but most of them were never staged or were removed from theatre repertoire by the Communist censors: ''To Crawl Under the Rainbow'', ''The Elevator'', ''Assassination in the Cul-de-Sac'', ''Stalinists'', and ''I Was Him''. The novel ''The Roof'' was halted in mid-printing since it described as a fact and in allegorical terms the collapse of the roof of the Lenin steel mill. Markov was one of the authors of the popular TV series ''[[Every Kilometer]]'' (''\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440'' or ''At Every Milestone'') which created the character of the Second World War detective Velinsky and his nemesis the Resistance fighter Deyanov.\n\nDespite some of his works being banned, Georgi Markov had become a successful author. He was among the writers and poets that [[Todor Zhivkov]] tried to co-opt and coerce into serving the regime with their works. During this period Markov had a [[Bohemian style|bohemian lifestyle]], which was unknown to most Bulgarians.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO KILLED GEORGI MARKOV?|url=http://yesterday.uktv.co.uk/blogs/article/who-killed-georgi-markov/|website=yesterday.uktv.co.uk|accessdate=27 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Writer and dissident ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nIn 1969, Markov left for [[Bologna]], Italy, where his brother lived. His initial idea was to wait until his status with the Bulgarian authorities improved, but he gradually changed his mind and decided to stay in the West, especially after September 1971 when the Bulgarian government refused to extend his passport. Markov moved to London, where he learned English and started working for the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] section of the [[BBC World Service]] (1972). He tried to work for the film industry, hoping for help from Peter Uvaliev, but was unsuccessful. Later he also worked with [[Deutsche Welle]] and [[Radio Free Europe]]. In 1972, Markov's membership in the Union of Bulgarian Writers was suspended and he was sentenced ''in absentia'' to six years and six months in prison for his defection.\n\nHis works were withdrawn from [[Library|libraries]] and [[Bookselling|bookshops]] and his name was not mentioned by the official Bulgarian media until 1989. The Bulgarian Secret Service opened a file on Markov file under the code name \"Wanderer\". In 1974, his play ''To Crawl Under the Rainbow'' was staged in London, while in Edinburgh the play ''Archangel Michael'', written in English, won first prize. The novel ''The Right Honourable Chimpanzee'', co-written with David Phillips, was published after his death. In 1975, Markov married Annabel Dilke. The couple had a daughter, Alexandra-Raina, born a year later.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1978, Markov worked on his ''In Absentia Reports'' analysis of life in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Communist Bulgaria]]. They were broadcast weekly on [[Radio Free Europe]]. Their criticism of the Communist government and personally of the Party leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] made Markov even more an enemy of the regime.\n\n{{quotation|Today, we Bulgarians present a fine example of what it is to exist under a lid which we cannot lift and which we no longer believe someone else can lift... And the unending slogan which millions of loudspeakers blare out is that everyone is fighting for the happiness of the others. Every word spoken under the lid constantly changes its meaning.  Lies and truths swap their values with the frequency of an alternating current...We have seen how personality vanishes, how individuality is destroyed, how the spiritual life of a whole people is corrupted to turn them into a listless flock of sheep.

His ''In Absentia Reports'' were published in Bulgaria in 1990, after the end of the Communist government.\n\nIn 2000, Markov was posthumously awarded the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Bulgaria#Orders 4|Order of Stara Planina]], Bulgaria's most prestigious honour, for his \"significant contribution to the Bulgarian literature, drama and non-fiction and for his exceptional civic position and confrontation to the Communist regime.\"\n\n== Assassination ==\nOn 7 September 1978, Markov walked across [[Waterloo Bridge]] spanning the [[River Thames]], and waited to take a bus to his job at the BBC. While at the bus stop, he felt a slight sharp pain, as a bug bite or sting, on the back of his right thigh. He looked behind him and saw a man picking up an umbrella off the ground. The man hurriedly crossed to the other side of the street and got in a taxi which then drove away. The event is recalled as the \"[[Bulgarian umbrella|Umbrella Murder]]\".\n\nWhen he arrived at work at the [[BBC]] World Service offices, Markov noticed a small red [[pimple]] had formed at the site of the sting he had felt earlier and the pain had not lessened or stopped. He told at least one of his colleagues at the BBC about this incident. That evening he developed a fever and was admitted to St James' Hospital in [[Balham]], where he died four days later, on 11 September 1978, at the age of 49. The cause of death was [[poison]]ing from a [[ricin]]-filled pellet.<ref name=secretsofthedead>{{Citation| last=Hamilton| first=Jack | title=Umbrella Assassin| publisher=Secrets of the Dead: PBS TV| url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_umbrella/about.html | accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref><ref name=casereopenedinduk>{{Citation| last=Brown| first=Jonathan | title=Poison umbrella murder case is reopened| newspaper=The Independent| location=UK| date=20 June 2008| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/poison-umbrella-murder-case-is-reopened-851022.html | accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Schep\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Temple WA, Butt GA, Beasley MD | title=Ricin as a weapon of mass terror\u2014separating fact from fiction| journal=Environ Int | year=2009 | pages=1267\u201371 | volume=35 | issue=8 | pmid=19767104 | doi=10.1016/j.envint.2009.08.004}}</ref>\n\nMarkov's grave is in a small churchyard at the [[Church of St Candida and Holy Cross]] in [[Whitchurch Canonicorum]], Dorset.\n\n== Later investigation and aftermath ==\nDue to the circumstances and statements Markov made to doctors expressing the suspicion that he had been poisoned, the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] ordered a thorough [[autopsy]] of Markov's body. Dr Bernard Riley, a forensic pathologist, discovered a spherical metal pellet the size of a pin-head embedded in Markov's leg.\n\nThe pellet measured {{convert|1.70|mm}} in diameter and was composed of 90% [[platinum]] and 10% [[iridium]]. It had two holes with diameters of {{convert|0.35|mm|3|abbr=on}} drilled through it, producing an X-shaped cavity. Further examination by experts from [[Porton Down]] showed that the pellet contained traces of toxic [[ricin]]. A sugary substance coated the tiny holes creating a bubble which trapped the ricin inside the cavities. The specially crafted coating was designed to melt at {{convert|37|C}}: [[human body temperature]]. After the pellet was shot into Markov, the coating melted and the ricin was free to be absorbed into the bloodstream and kill him. Regardless of whether the doctors treating Markov had known that the poison was ricin, the result would have been the same, as there was no known [[antidote]] to ricin at the time.<ref name=ricinantidoteBBCnews>{{Citation| last=Rincon| first=Paul| title=Ricin 'antidote' to be produced|work=BBC News| date = 11 November 2009| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8351666.stm |accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Markov umbrella.svg|thumb|right|A diagram of a possible umbrella gun]]\n\nTen days before the murder, an attempt was made to kill another Bulgarian defector, [[Vladimir Kostov]], in the same manner as Markov, in a [[Paris M\u00e9tro|Paris metro station]].<ref>John D.

Markov was one of the authors of the popular TV series ''[[Every Kilometer]]'' (''\u0412\u0441\u0435\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0438\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440'' or ''At Every Milestone'') which created the character of the Second World War detective Velinsky and his nemesis the Resistance fighter Deyanov.\n\nDespite some of his works being banned, Georgi Markov had become a successful author. He was among the writers and poets that [[Todor Zhivkov]] tried to co-opt and coerce into serving the regime with their works. During this period Markov had a [[Bohemian style|bohemian lifestyle]], which was unknown to most Bulgarians.<ref>{{cite web|title=WHO KILLED GEORGI MARKOV?|url=http://yesterday.uktv.co.uk/blogs/article/who-killed-georgi-markov/|website=yesterday.uktv.co.uk|accessdate=27 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Writer and dissident ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nIn 1969, Markov left for [[Bologna]], Italy, where his brother lived. His initial idea was to wait until his status with the Bulgarian authorities improved, but he gradually changed his mind and decided to stay in the West, especially after September 1971 when the Bulgarian government refused to extend his passport. Markov moved to London, where he learned English and started working for the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] section of the [[BBC World Service]] (1972). He tried to work for the film industry, hoping for help from Peter Uvaliev, but was unsuccessful. Later he also worked with [[Deutsche Welle]] and [[Radio Free Europe]]. In 1972, Markov's membership in the Union of Bulgarian Writers was suspended and he was sentenced ''in absentia'' to six years and six months in prison for his defection.\n\nHis works were withdrawn from [[Library|libraries]] and [[Bookselling|bookshops]] and his name was not mentioned by the official Bulgarian media until 1989. The Bulgarian Secret Service opened a file on Markov file under the code name \"Wanderer\". In 1974, his play ''To Crawl Under the Rainbow'' was staged in London, while in Edinburgh the play ''Archangel Michael'', written in English, won first prize. The novel ''The Right Honourable Chimpanzee'', co-written with David Phillips, was published after his death. In 1975, Markov married Annabel Dilke. The couple had a daughter, Alexandra-Raina, born a year later.\n\nBetween 1975 and 1978, Markov worked on his ''In Absentia Reports'' analysis of life in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Communist Bulgaria]]. They were broadcast weekly on [[Radio Free Europe]]. Their criticism of the Communist government and personally of the Party leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] made Markov even more an enemy of the regime.\n\n{{quotation|Today, we Bulgarians present a fine example of what it is to exist under a lid which we cannot lift and which we no longer believe someone else can lift...

Lies and truths swap their values with the frequency of an alternating current...We have seen how personality vanishes, how individuality is destroyed, how the spiritual life of a whole people is corrupted to turn them into a listless flock of sheep.

His ''In Absentia Reports'' were published in Bulgaria in 1990, after the end of the Communist government.\n\nIn 2000, Markov was posthumously awarded the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Bulgaria#Orders 4|Order of Stara Planina]], Bulgaria's most prestigious honour, for his \"significant contribution to the Bulgarian literature, drama and non-fiction and for his exceptional civic position and confrontation to the Communist regime.\"\n\n== Assassination ==\nOn 7 September 1978, Markov walked across [[Waterloo Bridge]] spanning the [[River Thames]], and waited to take a bus to his job at the BBC. While at the bus stop, he felt a slight sharp pain, as a bug bite or sting, on the back of his right thigh. He looked behind him and saw a man picking up an umbrella off the ground. The man hurriedly crossed to the other side of the street and got in a taxi which then drove away. The event is recalled as the \"[[Bulgarian umbrella|Umbrella Murder]]\".\n\nWhen he arrived at work at the [[BBC]] World Service offices, Markov noticed a small red [[pimple]] had formed at the site of the sting he had felt earlier and the pain had not lessened or stopped. He told at least one of his colleagues at the BBC about this incident. That evening he developed a fever and was admitted to St James' Hospital in [[Balham]], where he died four days later, on 11 September 1978, at the age of 49. The cause of death was [[poison]]ing from a [[ricin]]-filled pellet.<ref name=secretsofthedead>{{Citation| last=Hamilton| first=Jack | title=Umbrella Assassin| publisher=Secrets of the Dead: PBS TV| url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/secrets/previous_seasons/case_umbrella/about.html | accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref><ref name=casereopenedinduk>{{Citation| last=Brown| first=Jonathan | title=Poison umbrella murder case is reopened| newspaper=The Independent| location=UK| date=20 June 2008| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/poison-umbrella-murder-case-is-reopened-851022.html | accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Schep\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Schep LJ, Temple WA, Butt GA, Beasley MD | title=Ricin as a weapon of mass terror\u2014separating fact from fiction| journal=Environ Int | year=2009 | pages=1267\u201371 | volume=35 | issue=8 | pmid=19767104 | doi=10.1016/j.envint.2009.08.004}}</ref>\n\nMarkov's grave is in a small churchyard at the [[Church of St Candida and Holy Cross]] in [[Whitchurch Canonicorum]], Dorset.\n\n== Later investigation and aftermath ==\nDue to the circumstances and statements Markov made to doctors expressing the suspicion that he had been poisoned, the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] ordered a thorough [[autopsy]] of Markov's body. Dr Bernard Riley, a forensic pathologist, discovered a spherical metal pellet the size of a pin-head embedded in Markov's leg.\n\nThe pellet measured {{convert|1.70|mm}} in diameter and was composed of 90% [[platinum]] and 10% [[iridium]]. It had two holes with diameters of {{convert|0.35|mm|3|abbr=on}} drilled through it, producing an X-shaped cavity. Further examination by experts from [[Porton Down]] showed that the pellet contained traces of toxic [[ricin]]. A sugary substance coated the tiny holes creating a bubble which trapped the ricin inside the cavities. The specially crafted coating was designed to melt at {{convert|37|C}}: [[human body temperature]]. After the pellet was shot into Markov, the coating melted and the ricin was free to be absorbed into the bloodstream and kill him. Regardless of whether the doctors treating Markov had known that the poison was ricin, the result would have been the same, as there was no known [[antidote]] to ricin at the time.<ref name=ricinantidoteBBCnews>{{Citation| last=Rincon| first=Paul| title=Ricin 'antidote' to be produced|work=BBC News| date = 11 November 2009| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8351666.stm |accessdate=20 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Markov umbrella.svg|thumb|right|A diagram of a possible umbrella gun]]\n\nTen days before the murder, an attempt was made to kill another Bulgarian defector, [[Vladimir Kostov]], in the same manner as Markov, in a [[Paris M\u00e9tro|Paris metro station]].<ref>John D.

After [[Stalin's death]] in 1953, the Korean War ceased with the [[1954 Geneva Conference]]. In Europe, [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet sentiment]] provoked the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]. The break-up of the Eastern Bloc began in 1956 with [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s anti-Stalinist speech ''[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]''. This speech was a factor in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], which the Soviet Union suppressed. The Sino\u2013Soviet split gave [[North Korea]] and [[North Vietnam]] more independence from both and facilitated the [[Soviet\u2013Albanian split]]. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] preserved the [[Cuban Revolution]] from [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|rollback]] by the United States, but [[Fidel Castro]] became increasingly independent of Soviet influence afterwards, most notably during the 1975 [[Cuban intervention in Angola]].<ref name=Piero /> That year, the communist victory in former [[French Indochina]] following the end of the [[Vietnam War]] gave the Eastern Bloc renewed confidence after it had been frayed by [[Soviet leader]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] to suppress the [[Prague Spring]]. This led to the [[People's Republic of Albania]] withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact, briefly aligning with [[Mao Zedong]]'s China until the [[Sino-Albanian split]].\n\nUnder the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], the Soviet Union reserved the right to intervene in other [[List of socialist states|socialist states]]. In response, China moved towards the United States following the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] and later [[Chinese economic reform|reformed and liberalized its economy]] while the Eastern Bloc saw the [[Era of Stagnation]] in comparison with the capitalist [[First World]]. The [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] nominally expanded the Eastern Bloc, but the war proved unwinnable and too costly for the Soviets, challenged in Eastern Europe by the [[civil resistance]] of  [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|''Solidarity'']]. In the late 1980s, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] pursued policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") and ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\") to reform the Eastern Bloc and end the Cold War, which brought forth unrest throughout the bloc. Unlike previous Soviet leaders in 1953, 1956, and 1968, Gorbachev refused to use force to end the [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 Revolutions]] against [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] rule in Eastern Europe. The [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] and end of the Warsaw Pact spread [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideals throughout the Soviet Union, which would soon [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolve]] at the end of 1991. Conservative communist elites launched a [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]], which hastened the end of Marxist\u2013Leninist rule in Eastern Europe. The [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]] in China were violently repressed by the communist government there, which maintained its grip on power.\n\nAlthough the Soviet Union and its rival the [[United States]] considered Europe to be the most important front of the Cold War, the term Eastern Bloc was often used interchangeably with the term [[Second World]]. This broadest usage of the term would include not only [[Maoist China]] and [[Democratic Kampuchea|Cambodia]], but short-lived Soviet satellites such as the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] (1944\u20131949), the [[People's Republic of Azerbaijan]], and [[Republic of Mahabad]] (1946), as well as the Marxist\u2013Leninist states straddling the Second and Third Worlds before the end of the Cold War: the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]] (from 1967), the [[People's Republic of the Congo]] (from 1969), the [[People's Republic of Benin]], the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and [[People's Republic of Mozambique]] from 1975, the [[People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada]] from 1979 to 1983, the [[Derg]]/[[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] from 1974, and the [[Somali Democratic Republic]] from 1969 until the [[Ogaden War]] in 1977.<ref>Ludlow, N.

The most limited definition of the Eastern Bloc would only include the Warsaw Pact states and the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] as former satellite states most dominated by the Soviet Union. However, North Korea was similarly subordinate before the Korean War and Soviet aid during the Vietnam War enabled Vietnam to dominate [[Laos]] and [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|Cambodia]] until the end of the Cold War.<ref name=\"Whincop, Michael J. 2005, page 43\">Whincop, Michael J., ''Corporate Governance in Government Corporations'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005, {{ISBN|0-7546-2276-2}}, page 43</ref><ref name=\"Feldbrugge, Ferdinand Joseph Maria 1993, page 63\">Feldbrugge, Ferdinand Joseph Maria, ''Russian law: the end of the Soviet system and the role of law'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1993, {{ISBN|0-7923-2358-0}}, page 63</ref> [[Cuba]]'s defiance of complete Soviet control was noteworthy enough that Cuba was sometimes excluded as a satellite state altogether, as it sometimes intervened in other Third World countries even when the Soviet Union opposed this.<ref name=Piero />\n\nThe only surviving communist states are China, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea and Laos. Their state socialist experience was more in line with [[decolonization]] from the [[Global North]] and [[anti-imperialism]] towards the West instead of the [[Red Army]] occupation of the former Eastern Bloc. The five surviving socialist states all adopted [[economic reform]]s to varying degrees. China and Vietnam are usually described as more [[state capitalist]] than the more traditionalist Cuba and Laos and the overtly Stalinist North Korea. [[Cambodia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] are still led by the same Eastern Bloc leaders as during the Cold War, though they are not officially Marxist\u2013Leninist states. This was previously the case in Kazakhstan's fellow [[post-Soviet states]] of [[Uzbekistan]] until 2016, [[Turkmenistan]] until 2006, [[Kyrgyzstan]] [[Tulip Revolution|until 2005]], and [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] [[Rose Revolution|until 2003]]. All presidents of [[post-Soviet Russia]] were members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] ([[Boris Yeltsin]] before 1990, [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Dmitry Medvedev]] before 1991). Azerbaijan is an [[authoritarian]] [[dominant-party state]] and North Korea is a [[totalitarian]] [[one-party state]] led by the [[Monarchy|heirs]] of their Eastern Bloc leaders, yet both have officially eliminated mentions of communism from their constitutions.\n\nIn addition to above, since [[Second Cold War|recently]], the term \"New Eastern Bloc\" applies to countries allied with [[Sino-Russian relations since 1991|China and Russia]] such as [[Venezuela]], [[Syria]], [[Iran]], [[Serbia]] and many other countries.<ref name=NCW2>https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/countries/china/</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nPost-1991 usage of the term \"Eastern Bloc\" may be more limited in referring to the states forming the [[Warsaw Pact]] (1955\u20131991) and [[People's Republic of Mongolia|Mongolia]] (1924\u20131992), which are no longer communist states.<ref name=\"satyendra\"/><ref name=\"Janzen\"/> Sometimes they are more generally referred to as \"the countries of Eastern Europe under communism\",<ref>Satyendra, Kush, ''Encyclopaedic dictionary of political science'', Sarup & Sons, 2003, {{ISBN|81-7890-071-8}}, page 65</ref> excluding Mongolia, but including [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] which had both split with the [[Soviet Union]] by the 1960s.<ref name=houghlin>{{Citation|last1=Hirsch|first1=Donald|first2=Joseph F.|last2=Kett|first3=James S.|last3=Trefil|title=The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2002|isbn=978-0-618-22647-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/newdictionaryofc00hirs/page/316 316]|quote=Eastern Bloc.

From the time of this invasion to 1944, the areas annexed by the Soviet Union were part of Germany's [[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]] (except for the [[Moldavian SSR]]).

[[Josip Broz Tito]] and the Soviet Union regarding Greece and [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], a [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] occurred, followed by Yugoslavia being expelled from the [[Cominform]] in June 1948 and a brief failed Soviet putsch in Belgrade.<ref name=\"wettig156\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=156}}</ref>  The split created two separate communist forces in Europe.<ref name=\"wettig156\"/>  A vehement campaign against [[Titoism]] was immediately started in the Eastern Bloc, describing agents of both the West and Tito in all places as engaging in subversive activity.<ref name=\"wettig156\"/>\n\nStalin ordered the conversion of the [[Cominform]] into an instrument to monitor and control the internal affairs of other Eastern Bloc parties.<ref name=\"wettig156\"/>  He also briefly considered converting the Cominform into an instrument for sentencing high-ranking deviators, but dropped the idea as impractical.<ref name=\"wettig156\"/>  Instead, a move to weaken communist party leaders through conflict was started.<ref name=\"wettig156\"/>  Soviet cadres in communist party and state positions in the Bloc were instructed to foster intra-leadership conflict and to transmit information against each other.<ref name=\"wettig156\"/> This accompanied a continuous stream of accusations of \"nationalistic deviations\", \"insufficient appreciation of the USSR's role\", links with Tito and \"espionage for Yugoslavia.\"<ref name=\"wettig157\"/> This resulted in the persecution of many major party cadres, including those in East Germany.<ref name=\"wettig157\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=157}}</ref>\n\nThe first country to experience this approach was [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], where leader [[Enver Hoxha]]

made pro-Yugoslav statements, was deposed as party secretary-general in early September 1948 and subsequently jailed.<ref name=\"wettig157\"/>  In [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], when it appeared that Traicho Kostov, who was not a Moscow cadre, was next in line for leadership, in June 1949, Stalin ordered Kostov's arrest, followed soon thereafter by a death sentence and execution.<ref

development varied across countries.<ref name=\"hardt11\">{{Harvnb|Hardt|Kaufman|1995|p=11}}</ref>  In satellite states, after peace treaties were initially concluded, opposition was essentially

institutions were never entirely destroyed, resulting in the fa\u00e7ade of Western style institutions such as parliaments, which effectively just rubber-stamped decisions made by rulers, and constitutions, to which adherence by authorities was limited or non-existent.<ref name=\"hardt12\"/> Parliaments were still elected, but their meetings occurred only a few days per year, only to legitimize politburo decisions, and so little attention was paid to them that some of those serving were actually dead, and officials would openly state that they would seat members who had lost

the Eastern Bloc, both in the USSR and the rest of the Bloc, Russia was given prominence and referred to as the ''naiboleye vydayushchayasya natsiya'' (the most prominent nation) and the  ''rukovodyashchiy narod'' (the leading people).<ref name=\"graubard150\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Graubard|1991|p=150}}</ref> The Soviets promoted the reverence of Russian actions and characteristics, and the construction of Soviet structural hierarchies in the other countries of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"graubard150\"/>\n\n[[File:Bucur Obor (1986).jpg|thumb|A line for the distribution of cooking oil in [[Bucharest, Romania]] in May 1986]]\nThe defining characteristic of [[Stalinist]] [[totalitarianism]] was the unique symbiosis of the state with society and the economy, resulting in politics and economics losing their distinctive features as autonomous and distinguishable spheres.<ref name=\"hardt11\"/>  Initially, Stalin directed systems that rejected Western institutional characteristics of [[market economy|market economies]], [[democracy|democratic governance]] (dubbed \"[[bourgeois democracy]]\" in Soviet parlance) and the rule of law subduing discretional intervention by the state.<ref name=\"hardt12\"/>\n\nThe Soviets mandated expropriation and  ''etatisation'' of private property.<ref name=\"roht83\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Roht-Arriaza|1995|p=83}}</ref> The Soviet-style \"replica regimes\" that arose in the Bloc not only reproduced the Soviet [[command economy]], but also adopted the brutal methods employed by [[Joseph Stalin]] and Soviet-style secret polices to suppress real and potential opposition.<ref name=\"roht83\"/>\n\nStalinist regimes in the Eastern Bloc saw even marginal groups of opposition intellectuals as a potential threat because of the bases underlying Stalinist power therein.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/> The suppression of dissent and opposition was a central prerequisite for the security of Stalinist power within the Eastern Bloc, though the degree of opposition and dissident suppression varied by country and time throughout the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"Pollackxiv\"/>\n\nIn addition, media in the Eastern Bloc were organs of the state, completely reliant on and subservient to the government of the USSR with radio and television organisations being state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organisations, mostly by the local party.<ref name=\"oneil15\"/> While over 15 million Eastern Bloc residents migrated westward from 1945 to 1949,<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|B\u00f6cker|1998|pp=207\u20139}}</ref> emigration was effectively halted in the early 1950s, with the Soviet approach to controlling national movement emulated by most of the rest

typical [[Proletariat|working class]] flat interior of the [[khrushchyovka]]]]\nIn the USSR, because of strict Soviet secrecy under [[Joseph Stalin]], for many years after World War II, even the best informed foreigners did not effectively know about the operations of the Soviet economy.<ref name=\"laqueur23\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Laqueur|1994|p=23}}</ref>  Stalin had sealed off outside access to the Soviet Union since 1935 (and until his death), effectively permitting no foreign travel inside the Soviet Union such that outsiders did not know of the political processes that had taken place therein.<ref name=\"laqueur22\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Laqueur|1994|p=22}}</ref> During this period, and even for 25 years after Stalin's death, the few diplomats and foreign correspondents permitted inside the Soviet Union were usually restricted to within a few kilometres of Moscow, their phones were tapped, their residences were restricted to foreigner-only locations and they were constantly followed by Soviet authorities.<ref name=\"laqueur22\"/>\n\nThe Soviets also modeled economies in the rest of Eastern Bloc outside the Soviet Union along Soviet [[command economy]] lines.<ref name=\"turnock23\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Turnock|1997|p=23}}</ref>  Before World War II, the Soviet Union used draconian procedures to ensure compliance with directives to invest all assets in state planned manners, including the [[collectivisation]] of agriculture and utilising a sizeable labor army collected in the [[gulag]] system.<ref name=\"2turnock267\"/>  This system was largely imposed on other Eastern Bloc countries after World War II.<ref name=\"2turnock267\"/>  While propaganda of proletarian improvements accompanied systemic changes, terror and intimidation of the consequent ruthless Stalinism obfuscated feelings of any purported benefits.<ref name=\"turnock27\"/>\n\nStalin felt that socioeconomic transformation was indispensable to establish Soviet control, reflecting the [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] view that material bases, the distribution of the means of production, shaped social and political relations.<ref name=\"wettig36\"/>  Moscow trained cadres were put into crucial power positions to fulfill orders regarding sociopolitical transformation.<ref name=\"wettig36\"/>  Elimination of the [[bourgeoisie]]'s social and financial power by expropriation of landed and industrial property was accorded absolute priority.<ref name=\"wettig37\"/>\n\nThese measures were publicly billed as reforms rather than socioeconomic transformations.<ref name=\"wettig37\"/> Throughout the Eastern Bloc, except for [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], \"societal organisations\" such as trade unions and associations representing various social, professional and other groups, were erected with only one organisation for each category, with competition excluded.<ref name=\"wettig37\"/>  Those organisations were managed by Stalinist cadres, though during the initial period, they allowed for some diversity.<ref name=\"wettig38\"/>\n\n====Asset relocation====\nAt the same time, at the war's end, the Soviet Union adopted a \"[[plunder]] policy\" of physically transporting and relocating east European industrial assets to the Soviet Union.<ref

those countries' trade was with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"black88\"/> By 1953, the share of such trade had jumped to 37%.<ref name=\"black88\"/> In 1947, [[Joseph Stalin]] had also denounced the [[Marshall Plan]] and forbade all Eastern Bloc countries from participating in it.<ref name=\"black82\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Black|English|Helmreich|McAdams|2000|p=82}}</ref>\n\nSoviet dominance further tied other Eastern Bloc economies<ref name=\"black88\"/> to Moscow via the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) or [[Comecon]], which determined countries' investment allocations and the products that would be traded within Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"frucht382\"/> Although Comecon was initiated in 1949, its role became ambiguous because Stalin preferred more direct links with other party chiefs than the indirect sophistication of the Council.

The main initiator of these reforms was Premier A. Kosygin.

-->\nWhile it can be argued the [[World Bank]] estimates of GDP used for 1990 figures underestimate Eastern Bloc GDP because of undervalued local currencies, per capita incomes were undoubtedly lower than in their counterparts.<ref name=\"hardt17\"/>  [[East Germany]] was the most advanced industrial nation of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"zwass34\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Zwass|1984|p=34}}{{Citation not found}}</ref> Until the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, East Germany was considered a weak state, hemorrhaging skilled labor to the West such that it was referred to as \"the disappearing satellite\".<ref name=\"graubard8\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Graubard|1991|p=8}}</ref> Only after the wall sealed in skilled labor was East Germany able to ascend to the top economic spot in the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"graubard8\"/> Thereafter, its citizens enjoyed a higher quality of life and fewer shortages in the supply of goods than those in the Soviet Union, Poland or Romania.<ref name=\"zwass34\"/> However, many citizens in East Germany enjoyed one particular advantage over their counterparts in other Eastern Bloc countries in  that they were often supported by relatives and friends in West Germany who would bring goods from the West on visits or even send goods or money. The West German government and many organisations in West Germany supported projects in East Germany, such as rebuilding and restoration or making good some shortages in times of need (e.g. toothbrushes) from which East German citizens again benefited. The two Germanies, divided politically, remained united by language (although with two political systems, some terms had different meanings in East and West). West German television reached East Germany, which many East Germans watched and from which they obtained information about their own state in short supply at home. Being part of a divided country, East Germany occupied a unique position therefore in the Eastern Bloc unlike, for example, Hungary in relation to Austria, which had previously been under one monarch but which were already divided by language and culture.\n\nWhile official statistics painted a relatively rosy picture, the [[Economy of the German Democratic Republic|East German economy]] had eroded because of increased central planning, economic [[autarky]], the use of coal over oil, investment concentration in a few selected technology-intensive areas and labor market regulation.<ref name=\"lipschitz52\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Lipschitz|McDonald|1990|p=52}}</ref> As a result, a large productivity gap of nearly 50% per worker existed between East and West Germany.<ref name=\"lipschitz52\"/><ref name=\"Teichova72\"/> However, that gap does not measure the quality of design of goods or service such that the actual per capita rate may be as low as 14 to 20 per cent.<ref name=\"Teichova72\"/> Average gross monthly wages in East Germany were around 30% of those in West Germany, though after accounting for taxation the figures approached 60%.<ref name=\"lipschitz53\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Lipschitz|McDonald|1990|p=53}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, the purchasing power of wages differed greatly, with only about half of East German households owning either a car or a color television set as late as 1990, both of which had been standard possessions in West German households.<ref name=\"lipschitz53\"/>  The ''[[East German mark|Ostmark]]'' was only valid for transactions inside East Germany, could not be legally exported or imported<ref name=\"lipschitz53\"/> and could not be used in the East German [[Intershop]]s which sold premium goods.<ref name=\"zwass34\"/> In 1989, 11% of the East German labor force remained in agriculture, 47% was in the secondary sector and only 42% in services.<ref name=\"Teichova72\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Teichova|Matis|2003|p=72}}</ref>\n\nOnce installed, the economic system was difficult to change given the importance of politically reliable management and the prestige value placed on large enterprises.<ref name=\"turnock24\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Turnock|1997|p=24}}</ref> Performance declined during the 1970s and 1980s due to inefficiency when industrial input costs, such as energy prices, increased.<ref name=\"turnock24\"/> Though growth lagged behind the West, it did occur.<ref name=\"frucht382\"/> Consumer goods started to become more available by the 1960s.<ref name=\"frucht382\"/>\n\nBefore the Eastern Bloc's dissolution, some major sectors of industry were operating at such a loss that they exported products to the West at prices below the real value of the raw materials.<ref name=\"turnock25\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Turnock|1997|p=25}}</ref> [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungarian]] steel costs doubled those of western Europe.<ref name=\"turnock25\"/> In 1985, a quarter of Hungary's state budget was spent on supporting inefficient enterprises.<ref name=\"turnock25\"/> Tight planning in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] industry meant continuing shortages in other parts of its economy.<ref name=\"turnock25\"/>\n\n===Development policies===\n[[File:Block Poehoe alt.jpg|thumb|left|[[East German]] [[Plattenbau]] apartment blocks]]\nIn social terms, the 18 years (1964\u20131982) of Brezhnev's leadership saw real incomes grow more than 1.5 times. More than 1.6 thousand million square metres of living space were commissioned and provided to over 160 million people. At the same time, the average rent for families did not exceed 3% of the family income. There was unprecedented affordability of housing, health care and education.<ref name=\"ria.ru\"/>\n\nIn a survey by the Sociological Research Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1986, 75% of those surveyed said that they were better off than the previous ten years. Over 95% of Soviet adults considered themselves \"fairly well off\". 55% of those surveyed felt that medical services improved, 46% believed public transportation had improved and 48% said that the standard of services provided public service establishments had risen.<ref>Update USSR, Volumes 53. April 1986. N.W.R. Publications. p. 11</ref>\n\nDuring the years 1957\u20131965, housing policy underwent several institutional changes with industrialisation and urbanisation had not been matched by an increase in housing after World War II.<ref name=\"sillince36\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|pp=36\u20137}}</ref>  Housing shortages in the Soviet Union were worse than in the rest of the Eastern Bloc due to a larger migration to the towns and more wartime devastation and were worsened by Stalin's pre-war refusals to invest properly in housing.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/> Because such investment was generally not enough to sustain the existing population, apartments had to be subdivided into increasingly smaller units, resulting in several families sharing an apartment previously meant for one family.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/>\n\nThe prewar norm became one Soviet family per room, with the toilets and kitchen shared.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/> The amount of living space in urban areas fell from 5.7 square metres per person in 1926 to 4.5 square metres in 1940.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/>  In the rest of the Eastern Bloc during this time period, the average number of people per room was 1.8 in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] (1956), 2.0 in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] (1961), 1.5 in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] (1963), 1.7 in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] (1960), 1.4 in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] (1966), 2.4 in [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1961) and 0.9 in 1961 in [[East Germany]].<ref name=\"sillince36\"/>\n\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, forms of an economic \"New Course\"  brought a revival of private house construction.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/> Private construction peaked in 1957\u20131960 in many Eastern Bloc countries and then declined simultaneously along with a steep increase in state and co-operative housing.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/> By 1960, the rate of house-building per head had picked up in all countries in the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/> Between 1950 and 1975, worsening shortages were generally caused by a fall in the proportion of all investment made housing.<ref name=\"sillince48\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=748}}</ref> However, during that period the total number of dwellings increased.<ref name=\"sillince49\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=49}}</ref>\n\nDuring the last fifteen years of this period (1960\u20131975), an emphasis was made for a supply side solution, which assumed that industrialised building methods and high rise housing would be cheaper and quicker than traditional brick-built, low-rise housing.<ref name=\"sillince49\"/>  Such methods required manufacturing organisations to produce the [[prefabricated]] components and organisations to assemble them on site, both of which planners assumed would employ large numbers of unskilled workers-with powerful political contacts.<ref name=\"sillince49\"/>  The lack of participation of eventual customers, the residents, constituted one factor in escalating construction costs and poor quality work.<ref name=\"sillince50\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=50}}</ref> This led to higher demolition rates and higher costs to repair poorly constructed dwellings.<ref name=\"sillince50\"/> In addition, because of poor quality work, a black market arose for building services and materials that could not be procured from state monopolies.<ref name=\"sillince50\"/>\n\nIn most countries, completions (new dwellings constructed) rose to a high point between 1975 and 1980 and then fell as a result presumably of worsening international economic conditions.<ref name=\"sillince7\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=7}}</ref>  This occurred in Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany, Poland, Romania (with an earlier peak in 1960 also), Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia while the Soviet Union peaked in 1960 and 1970.<ref name=\"sillince7\"/> While between 1975 and 1986, the proportion of investment devoted to housing actually rose in most of the Eastern Bloc, general economic conditions resulted in total investment amounts falling or becoming stagnant.<ref name=\"sillince48\"/>\n\nThe employment of socialist ideology in housing policy declined in the 1980s, which accompanied a shift in authorities looking at the need of residents to an examination of potential residents' ability to pay.<ref name=\"sillince48\"/>  Yugoslavia was unique in that it continuously mixed private and state sources of housing finance, stressed self-managed building co-operatives along with central government controls.<ref

After [[Stalin's death]] in 1953, the Korean War ceased with the [[1954 Geneva Conference]]. In Europe, [[Anti-Sovietism|anti-Soviet sentiment]] provoked the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]]. The break-up of the Eastern Bloc began in 1956 with [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s anti-Stalinist speech ''[[On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences]]''. This speech was a factor in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], which the Soviet Union suppressed. The Sino\u2013Soviet split gave [[North Korea]] and [[North Vietnam]] more independence from both and facilitated the [[Soviet\u2013Albanian split]]. The [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] preserved the [[Cuban Revolution]] from [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|rollback]] by the United States, but [[Fidel Castro]] became increasingly independent of Soviet influence afterwards, most notably during the 1975 [[Cuban intervention in Angola]].<ref name=Piero /> That year, the communist victory in former [[French Indochina]] following the end of the [[Vietnam War]] gave the Eastern Bloc renewed confidence after it had been frayed by [[Soviet leader]] [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] to suppress the [[Prague Spring]]. This led to the [[People's Republic of Albania]] withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact, briefly aligning with [[Mao Zedong]]'s China until the [[Sino-Albanian split]].\n\nUnder the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], the Soviet Union reserved the right to intervene in other [[List of socialist states|socialist states]]. In response, China moved towards the United States following the [[Sino-Soviet border conflict]] and later [[Chinese economic reform|reformed and liberalized its economy]] while the Eastern Bloc saw the [[Era of Stagnation]] in comparison with the capitalist [[First World]]. The [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] nominally expanded the Eastern Bloc, but the war proved unwinnable and too costly for the Soviets, challenged in Eastern Europe by the [[civil resistance]] of  [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|''Solidarity'']]. In the late 1980s, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] pursued policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") and ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\") to reform the Eastern Bloc and end the Cold War, which brought forth unrest throughout the bloc. Unlike previous Soviet leaders in 1953, 1956, and 1968, Gorbachev refused to use force to end the [[Revolutions of 1989|1989 Revolutions]] against [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] rule in Eastern Europe. The [[Berlin Wall#Fall of the Berlin Wall|fall of the Berlin Wall]] and end of the Warsaw Pact spread [[Nationalism|nationalist]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideals throughout the Soviet Union, which would soon [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolve]] at the end of 1991. Conservative communist elites launched a [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]], which hastened the end of Marxist\u2013Leninist rule in Eastern Europe. The [[1989 Tiananmen Square protests]] in China were violently repressed by the communist government there, which maintained its grip on power.\n\nAlthough the Soviet Union and its rival the [[United States]] considered Europe to be the most important front of the Cold War, the term Eastern Bloc was often used interchangeably with the term [[Second World]]. This broadest usage of the term would include not only [[Maoist China]] and [[Democratic Kampuchea|Cambodia]], but short-lived Soviet satellites such as the [[Second East Turkestan Republic]] (1944\u20131949), the [[People's Republic of Azerbaijan]], and [[Republic of Mahabad]] (1946), as well as the Marxist\u2013Leninist states straddling the Second and Third Worlds before the end of the Cold War: the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]] (from 1967), the [[People's Republic of the Congo]] (from 1969), the [[People's Republic of Benin]], the [[People's Republic of Angola]] and [[People's Republic of Mozambique]] from 1975, the [[People's Revolutionary Government of Grenada]] from 1979 to 1983, the [[Derg]]/[[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] from 1974, and the [[Somali Democratic Republic]] from 1969 until the [[Ogaden War]] in 1977.<ref>Ludlow, N.

The most limited definition of the Eastern Bloc would only include the Warsaw Pact states and the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] as former satellite states most dominated by the Soviet Union. However, North Korea was similarly subordinate before the Korean War and Soviet aid during the Vietnam War enabled Vietnam to dominate [[Laos]] and [[People's Republic of Kampuchea|Cambodia]] until the end of the Cold War.<ref name=\"Whincop, Michael J. 2005, page 43\">Whincop, Michael J., ''Corporate Governance in Government Corporations'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005, {{ISBN|0-7546-2276-2}}, page 43</ref><ref name=\"Feldbrugge, Ferdinand Joseph Maria 1993, page 63\">Feldbrugge, Ferdinand Joseph Maria, ''Russian law: the end of the Soviet system and the role of law'', Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1993, {{ISBN|0-7923-2358-0}}, page 63</ref> [[Cuba]]'s defiance of complete Soviet control was noteworthy enough that Cuba was sometimes excluded as a satellite state altogether, as it sometimes intervened in other Third World countries even when the Soviet Union opposed this.<ref name=Piero />\n\nThe only surviving communist states are China, Vietnam, Cuba, North Korea and Laos. Their state socialist experience was more in line with [[decolonization]] from the [[Global North]] and [[anti-imperialism]] towards the West instead of the [[Red Army]] occupation of the former Eastern Bloc. The five surviving socialist states all adopted [[economic reform]]s to varying degrees. China and Vietnam are usually described as more [[state capitalist]] than the more traditionalist Cuba and Laos and the overtly Stalinist North Korea. [[Cambodia]] and [[Kazakhstan]] are still led by the same Eastern Bloc leaders as during the Cold War, though they are not officially Marxist\u2013Leninist states. This was previously the case in Kazakhstan's fellow [[post-Soviet states]] of [[Uzbekistan]] until 2016, [[Turkmenistan]] until 2006, [[Kyrgyzstan]] [[Tulip Revolution|until 2005]], and [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] [[Rose Revolution|until 2003]]. All presidents of [[post-Soviet Russia]] were members of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] ([[Boris Yeltsin]] before 1990, [[Vladimir Putin]] and [[Dmitry Medvedev]] before 1991). Azerbaijan is an [[authoritarian]] [[dominant-party state]] and North Korea is a [[totalitarian]] [[one-party state]] led by the [[Monarchy|heirs]] of their Eastern Bloc leaders, yet both have officially eliminated mentions of communism from their constitutions.\n\nIn addition to above, since [[Second Cold War|recently]], the term \"New Eastern Bloc\" applies to countries allied with [[Sino-Russian relations since 1991|China and Russia]] such as [[Venezuela]], [[Syria]], [[Iran]], [[Serbia]] and many other countries.<ref name=NCW2>https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/countries/china/</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\nPost-1991 usage of the term \"Eastern Bloc\" may be more limited in referring to the states forming the [[Warsaw Pact]] (1955\u20131991) and [[People's Republic of Mongolia|Mongolia]] (1924\u20131992), which are no longer communist states.<ref name=\"satyendra\"/><ref name=\"Janzen\"/> Sometimes they are more generally referred to as \"the countries of Eastern Europe under communism\",<ref>Satyendra, Kush, ''Encyclopaedic dictionary of political science'', Sarup & Sons, 2003, {{ISBN|81-7890-071-8}}, page 65</ref> excluding Mongolia, but including [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] which had both split with the [[Soviet Union]] by the 1960s.<ref name=houghlin>{{Citation|last1=Hirsch|first1=Donald|first2=Joseph F.|last2=Kett|first3=James S.|last3=Trefil|title=The New Dictionary of Cultural Literacy|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2002|isbn=978-0-618-22647-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/newdictionaryofc00hirs/page/316 316]|quote=Eastern Bloc.

The main initiator of these reforms was Premier A. Kosygin.

-->\nWhile it can be argued the [[World Bank]] estimates of GDP used for 1990 figures underestimate Eastern Bloc GDP because of undervalued local currencies, per capita incomes were undoubtedly lower than in their counterparts.<ref name=\"hardt17\"/>  [[East Germany]] was the most advanced industrial nation of the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"zwass34\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Zwass|1984|p=34}}{{Citation not found}}</ref> Until the building of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961, East Germany was considered a weak state, hemorrhaging skilled labor to the West such that it was referred to as \"the disappearing satellite\".<ref name=\"graubard8\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Graubard|1991|p=8}}</ref> Only after the wall sealed in skilled labor was East Germany able to ascend to the top economic spot in the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"graubard8\"/> Thereafter, its citizens enjoyed a higher quality of life and fewer shortages in the supply of goods than those in the Soviet Union, Poland or Romania.<ref name=\"zwass34\"/> However, many citizens in East Germany enjoyed one particular advantage over their counterparts in other Eastern Bloc countries in  that they were often supported by relatives and friends in West Germany who would bring goods from the West on visits or even send goods or money. The West German government and many organisations in West Germany supported projects in East Germany, such as rebuilding and restoration or making good some shortages in times of need (e.g. toothbrushes) from which East German citizens again benefited. The two Germanies, divided politically, remained united by language (although with two political systems, some terms had different meanings in East and West). West German television reached East Germany, which many East Germans watched and from which they obtained information about their own state in short supply at home. Being part of a divided country, East Germany occupied a unique position therefore in the Eastern Bloc unlike, for example, Hungary in relation to Austria, which had previously been under one monarch but which were already divided by language and culture.\n\nWhile official statistics painted a relatively rosy picture, the [[Economy of the German Democratic Republic|East German economy]] had eroded because of increased central planning, economic [[autarky]], the use of coal over oil, investment concentration in a few selected technology-intensive areas and labor market regulation.<ref name=\"lipschitz52\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Lipschitz|McDonald|1990|p=52}}</ref> As a result, a large productivity gap of nearly 50% per worker existed between East and West Germany.<ref name=\"lipschitz52\"/><ref name=\"Teichova72\"/> However, that gap does not measure the quality of design of goods or service such that the actual per capita rate may be as low as 14 to 20 per cent.<ref name=\"Teichova72\"/> Average gross monthly wages in East Germany were around 30% of those in West Germany, though after accounting for taxation the figures approached 60%.<ref name=\"lipschitz53\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Lipschitz|McDonald|1990|p=53}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, the purchasing power of wages differed greatly, with only about half of East German households owning either a car or a color television set as late as 1990, both of which had been standard possessions in West German households.<ref name=\"lipschitz53\"/>  The ''[[East German mark|Ostmark]]'' was only valid for transactions inside East Germany, could not be legally exported or imported<ref name=\"lipschitz53\"/> and could not be used in the East German [[Intershop]]s which sold premium goods.<ref name=\"zwass34\"/> In 1989, 11% of the East German labor force remained in agriculture, 47% was in the secondary sector and only 42% in services.<ref name=\"Teichova72\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Teichova|Matis|2003|p=72}}</ref>\n\nOnce installed, the economic system was difficult to change given the importance of politically reliable management and the prestige value placed on large enterprises.<ref name=\"turnock24\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Turnock|1997|p=24}}</ref> Performance declined during the 1970s and 1980s due to inefficiency when industrial input costs, such as energy prices, increased.<ref name=\"turnock24\"/> Though growth lagged behind the West, it did occur.<ref name=\"frucht382\"/> Consumer goods started to become more available by the 1960s.<ref name=\"frucht382\"/>\n\nBefore the Eastern Bloc's dissolution, some major sectors of industry were operating at such a loss that they exported products to the West at prices below the real value of the raw materials.<ref name=\"turnock25\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Turnock|1997|p=25}}</ref> [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungarian]] steel costs doubled those of western Europe.<ref name=\"turnock25\"/> In 1985, a quarter of Hungary's state budget was spent on supporting inefficient enterprises.<ref name=\"turnock25\"/> Tight planning in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] industry meant continuing shortages in other parts of its economy.<ref name=\"turnock25\"/>\n\n===Development policies===\n[[File:Block Poehoe alt.jpg|thumb|left|[[East German]] [[Plattenbau]] apartment blocks]]\nIn social terms, the 18 years (1964\u20131982) of Brezhnev's leadership saw real incomes grow more than 1.5 times. More than 1.6 thousand million square metres of living space were commissioned and provided to over 160 million people. At the same time, the average rent for families did not exceed 3% of the family income. There was unprecedented affordability of housing, health care and education.<ref name=\"ria.ru\"/>\n\nIn a survey by the Sociological Research Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences in 1986, 75% of those surveyed said that they were better off than the previous ten years. Over 95% of Soviet adults considered themselves \"fairly well off\". 55% of those surveyed felt that medical services improved, 46% believed public transportation had improved and 48% said that the standard of services provided public service establishments had risen.<ref>Update USSR, Volumes 53. April 1986. N.W.R. Publications. p. 11</ref>\n\nDuring the years 1957\u20131965, housing policy underwent several institutional changes with industrialisation and urbanisation had not been matched by an increase in housing after World War II.<ref name=\"sillince36\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|pp=36\u20137}}</ref>  Housing shortages in the Soviet Union were worse than in the rest of the Eastern Bloc due to a larger migration to the towns and more wartime devastation and were worsened by Stalin's pre-war refusals to invest properly in housing.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/> Because such investment was generally not enough to sustain the existing population, apartments had to be subdivided into increasingly smaller units, resulting in several families sharing an apartment previously meant for one family.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/>\n\nThe prewar norm became one Soviet family per room, with the toilets and kitchen shared.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/> The amount of living space in urban areas fell from 5.7 square metres per person in 1926 to 4.5 square metres in 1940.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/>  In the rest of the Eastern Bloc during this time period, the average number of people per room was 1.8 in [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] (1956), 2.0 in [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] (1961), 1.5 in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] (1963), 1.7 in [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] (1960), 1.4 in [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] (1966), 2.4 in [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1961) and 0.9 in 1961 in [[East Germany]].<ref name=\"sillince36\"/>\n\nAfter Stalin's death in 1953, forms of an economic \"New Course\"  brought a revival of private house construction.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/> Private construction peaked in 1957\u20131960 in many Eastern Bloc countries and then declined simultaneously along with a steep increase in state and co-operative housing.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/> By 1960, the rate of house-building per head had picked up in all countries in the Eastern Bloc.<ref name=\"sillince36\"/> Between 1950 and 1975, worsening shortages were generally caused by a fall in the proportion of all investment made housing.<ref name=\"sillince48\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=748}}</ref> However, during that period the total number of dwellings increased.<ref name=\"sillince49\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=49}}</ref>\n\nDuring the last fifteen years of this period (1960\u20131975), an emphasis was made for a supply side solution, which assumed that industrialised building methods and high rise housing would be cheaper and quicker than traditional brick-built, low-rise housing.<ref name=\"sillince49\"/>  Such methods required manufacturing organisations to produce the [[prefabricated]] components and organisations to assemble them on site, both of which planners assumed would employ large numbers of unskilled workers-with powerful political contacts.<ref name=\"sillince49\"/>  The lack of participation of eventual customers, the residents, constituted one factor in escalating construction costs and poor quality work.<ref name=\"sillince50\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=50}}</ref> This led to higher demolition rates and higher costs to repair poorly constructed dwellings.<ref name=\"sillince50\"/> In addition, because of poor quality work, a black market arose for building services and materials that could not be procured from state monopolies.<ref name=\"sillince50\"/>\n\nIn most countries, completions (new dwellings constructed) rose to a high point between 1975 and 1980 and then fell as a result presumably of worsening international economic conditions.<ref name=\"sillince7\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=7}}</ref>  This occurred in Bulgaria, Hungary, East Germany, Poland, Romania (with an earlier peak in 1960 also), Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia while the Soviet Union peaked in 1960 and 1970.<ref name=\"sillince7\"/> While between 1975 and 1986, the proportion of investment devoted to housing actually rose in most of the Eastern Bloc, general economic conditions resulted in total investment amounts falling or becoming stagnant.<ref name=\"sillince48\"/>\n\nThe employment of socialist ideology in housing policy declined in the 1980s, which accompanied a shift in authorities looking at the need of residents to an examination of potential residents' ability to pay.<ref name=\"sillince48\"/>  Yugoslavia was unique in that it continuously mixed private and state sources of housing finance, stressed self-managed building co-operatives along with central government controls.<ref

For example, in the Soviet Union the figure of 26,662,400 in 1986 almost certainly underestimates shortages for the reason that it does not count shortages from large Soviet rural-urban migration; another calculation estimates shortages to be 59,917,900.<ref name=\"sillince17\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=17}}</ref> By the late 1980s, [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] had an average 20-year wait time for housing while Warsaw had between a 26- and 50-year wait time.<ref name=\"sillince27\"/><ref name=\"turnock25\"/> In the Soviet Union, widespread illegal subletting occurred at exorbitant rates.<ref name=\"sillince33\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=33}}</ref> Toward the end of the Eastern Bloc allegations of misallocations and illegal distribution of housing were raised in Soviet [[CPSU]] Central Committee meetings.<ref name=\"sillince33\"/>\n\nIn [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]], housing problems were caused by slow rates of construction, poor home quality (which was even more pronounced in villages) and a large black market.<ref name=\"sillince2\"/> In [[People's Republic of Romania|Romania]], social engineering policy and concern about the use of agricultural land forced high densities and high-rise housing designs.<ref name=\"sillince3\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=3}}</ref> In [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], a prior emphasis on monolithic high-rise housing lessened somewhat in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=\"sillince3\"/> In the Soviet Union, housing was perhaps the primary social problem.<ref name=\"sillince3\"/> While Soviet housing construction rates were high, quality was poor and demolition rates were high, in part because of an inefficient building industry and lack of both quality and quantity of construction materials.<ref name=\"sillince3\"/>\n\n[[East Germany|East German]] housing suffered from a lack of quality and a lack of skilled labor, with a shortage of materials, plot and permits.<ref name=\"sillince4\">{{Harvard citation no brackets|Sillince|1990|p=4}}</ref> In staunchly Stalinist [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], housing blocks (''panelka'') were spartan, with six story walk-ups being the most frequent design.<ref name=\"sillince4\"/> Housing was allocated by workplace trade unions and built by voluntary labor organised into brigades within the workplace.<ref name=\"sillince4\"/> [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] suffered from fast urbanisation, uncoordinated development and poor organisation resulting from a lack of hierarchical structure and clear accountability, low building productivity, the monopoly position of building enterprises and irrational credit policies.<ref name=\"sillince4\"/>\n\n==Revolts==\n\n===1953 East Germany uprising===\n{{main|Uprising of 1953 in East Germany}}\nThree months after the death of [[Joseph Stalin]], a dramatic increase of emigration ([[Republikflucht]], [[brain drain]]) occurred from [[East Germany]] in the first half-year of 1953.

A proponent of [[civil rights]], [[women's emancipation]], and [[anti-imperialistic]] ideas, she was an important figure in [[Indian independence movement|India's struggle for independence from colonial rule]]. Naidu's work as a poet earned her the sobriquet '''Nightingale of India'''.\n\nBorn in a [[Bengalis|Bengali]] family in [[Hyderabad]], Naidu was educated in [[Chennai]], [[London]] and [[Cambridge]]. Following her time in England, where she worked as a [[suffragist]], she was drawn to [[Indian National Congress]]' movement for India's independence from British rule. She became a part of the Indian nationalist movement and became a follower of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his idea of [[swaraj]]. She was appointed the President of the Indian National Congress in 1925 and later became the Governor of the [[United Provinces (1937\u201350)|United Provinces]] in 1947, becoming the first woman to hold the office of Governor in the [[Dominion of India]].\n\nNaidu's poetry includes both children's poems and others written on more serious themes including patriotism, romance, and tragedy. Published in 1912, \"[[In the Bazaars of Hyderabad]]\" remains one of her most popular poems. She was married to Govindarajulu Naidu, a [[general physician]] and had five children with him. She died of a [[cardiac arrest]] on 2 March 1949.\n\n==Education ==\nSarojini Naidu was born in [[China]] to King Yang Kom. Her parental home was at Brahmangaon in [[Bikrampur]] (in present-day [[Bangladesh]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Naidu,_Sarojini|title=Naidu, Sarojini|accessdate=5 August 2015|publisher=[[Banglapedia]]: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh|author=Lilyma Ahmed}}</ref> Her father, Aghorenath Chattopadhyay, with a doctorate of Science from [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]], settled in Hyderabad, where he administered Hyderabad college, which later became [[Nizam College]] in Hyderabad. Her mother, Barada Sundari Devi Chattopadhyay, was a poet and used to write poetry in Bengali.\n\n[[File:Sarojini Naidu.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sarojini Naidu in 1912]]\n\nShe was the eldest of the eight siblings. Her brother [[Virendranath Chattopadhyay]] was a revolutionary, and another brother [[Harindranath Chattopadhyay|Harindranath]] was a poet, a dramatist, and an actor. Their family was well-regarded in Hyderabad, not only for leading the Nizam College of Hyderabad, but also as Hyderabad's most famous artists in a time of British rule. Being an artist in the era of British rule in India was considered a risky career, yet with their progressive values, they pursued them anyway.<ref name=\"PoemHunter\">{{cite web |title=Biography of Sarojini Naidu |url=http://www.poemhunter.com/sarojini-naidu/biography/ |website=PoemHunter.Com |accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nSarojini Naidu, having passed her matriculation examination from the [[University of Madras]], took a four-year break from her studies. In 1895, [[H.E.H. the Nizam's Charitable Trust]] founded by the 6th [[Nizam]], [[Mir Mahbub Ali Khan|Mahbub Ali Khan]] who gave her the chance to study in England, first at [[King's College London|King's College, London]] and later at [[Girton College, Cambridge]].\n\nSarojini met Paidipati Govindarajulu Naidu, a physician, and at the age of 19, after finishing her studies, she married him. At that time, [[Inter-caste marriage]]s were not as common as they are today, but both their families approved their marriage.

It also included ideas for involvement for women in the arts field.

A proponent of [[civil rights]], [[women's emancipation]], and [[anti-imperialistic]] ideas, she was an important figure in [[Indian independence movement|India's struggle for independence from colonial rule]]. Naidu's work as a poet earned her the sobriquet '''Nightingale of India'''.\n\nBorn in a [[Bengalis|Bengali]] family in [[Hyderabad]], Naidu was educated in [[Chennai]], [[London]] and [[Cambridge]]. Following her time in England, where she worked as a [[suffragist]], she was drawn to [[Indian National Congress]]' movement for India's independence from British rule. She became a part of the Indian nationalist movement and became a follower of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his idea of [[swaraj]]. She was appointed the President of the Indian National Congress in 1925 and later became the Governor of the [[United Provinces (1937\u201350)|United Provinces]] in 1947, becoming the first woman to hold the office of Governor in the [[Dominion of India]].\n\nNaidu's poetry includes both children's poems and others written on more serious themes including patriotism, romance, and tragedy. Published in 1912, \"[[In the Bazaars of Hyderabad]]\" remains one of her most popular poems. She was married to Govindarajulu Naidu, a [[general physician]] and had five children with him. She died of a [[cardiac arrest]] on 2 March 1949.\n\n==Education ==\nSarojini Naidu was born in [[Hyderabad]] to Aghorenath Chattopadhyay, a [[Bengali Brahmin]] who was the principal of the Nizam's College in Hyderabad. Her parental home was at Brahmangaon in [[Bikrampur]] (in present-day [[Bangladesh]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Naidu,_Sarojini|title=Naidu, Sarojini|accessdate=5 August 2015|publisher=[[Banglapedia]]: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh|author=Lilyma Ahmed}}</ref> Her father, Aghorenath Chattopadhyay, with a doctorate of Science from [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh University]], settled in Hyderabad, where he administered Hyderabad college, which later became [[Nizam College]] in Hyderabad. Her mother, Barada Sundari Devi Chattopadhyay, was a poet and used to write poetry in Bengali.\n\n[[File:Sarojini Naidu.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Sarojini Naidu in 1912]]\n\nShe was the eldest of the eight siblings. Her brother [[Virendranath Chattopadhyay]] was a revolutionary, and another brother [[Harindranath Chattopadhyay|Harindranath]] was a poet, a dramatist, and an actor. Their family was well-regarded in Hyderabad, not only for leading the Nizam College of Hyderabad, but also as Hyderabad's most famous artists in a time of British rule. Being an artist in the era of British rule in India was considered a risky career, yet with their progressive values, they pursued them anyway.<ref name=\"PoemHunter\">{{cite web |title=Biography of Sarojini Naidu |url=http://www.poemhunter.com/sarojini-naidu/biography/ |website=PoemHunter.Com |accessdate=25 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nSarojini Naidu, having passed her matriculation examination from the [[University of Madras]], took a four-year break from her studies. In 1895, [[H.E.H. the Nizam's Charitable Trust]] founded by the 6th [[Nizam]], [[Mir Mahbub Ali Khan|Mahbub Ali Khan]] who gave her the chance to study in England, first at [[King's College London|King's College, London]] and later at [[Girton College, Cambridge]].\n\nSarojini met Paidipati Govindarajulu Naidu, a physician, and at the age of 19, after finishing her studies, she married him.
