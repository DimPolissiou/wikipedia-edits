To better understand the term ''building'' compare the list of [[nonbuilding structure]]s.\n\nBuildings serve several societal needs \u2013 primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]] (a place of comfort and safety) and the ''outside'' (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).\n\nEver since the first [[cave painting]]s, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In recent years, interest in [[sustainable]] planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings.\n\n== Definitions ==\nThe word ''building'' is both a noun and a verb: the structure itself and the act of making it.

In this photo its garden doesn't appear]]\n\n=== Residential ===\n{{main|List of human habitation forms}}\n\nSingle-family residential buildings are most often called [[house]]s or [[home]]s. Multi-family residential buildings containing more than one dwelling unit are called a [[Duplex (building)|duplex]] or an [[apartment]] building. A [[condominium]] is an apartment that the occupant owns rather than rents. Houses may also be built in pairs ([[semi-detached]]), in terraces where all but two of the houses have others either side; apartments may be built round courtyards or as rectangular blocks surrounded by a piece of ground of varying sizes. Houses which were built as a single dwelling may later be divided into apartments or [[bedsitter]]s; they may also be converted to another use e.g. an office or a shop.\n\nBuilding types may range from [[Hut (dwelling)|hut]]s to multimillion-dollar high-rise [[apartment block]]s able to house thousands of people. Increasing settlement density in buildings (and smaller distances between buildings) is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from many people wanting to live close to work or similar attractors. Other common [[building material]]s are brick, concrete or combinations of either of these with stone.\n\nResidential buildings have different names for their use depending if they are seasonal include [[holiday cottage]] (vacation home) or [[timeshare]]; size such as a [[cottage]] or [[great house]]; value such as a [[shack]] or [[mansion]]; manner of construction such as a [[log home]] or [[mobile home]]; proximity to the ground such as [[Earth sheltering|earth sheltered]] house, [[stilt house]], or [[tree house]]. Also if the residents are in need of special care such as a [[nursing home]], [[orphanage]] or [[prison]]; or in group housing like [[barracks]] or [[dormitory|dormitories]].\n\nHistorically many people lived in communal buildings called [[longhouse]]s, smaller dwellings called [[pit-house]]s and houses combined with barns sometimes called [[housebarn]]s.\n\nBuildings are defined to be substantial, permanent structures so other dwelling forms such as [[houseboat]]s, [[yurt]]s, and [[motorhome]]s are [[dwelling]]s but not buildings.\n\n=== Complex ===\nSometimes a group of inter-related (and possibly inter-connected) builds are referred to as a complex \u2013 for example a ''[[housing complex]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/plans-to-convert-former-housing-complex-into-flats/story-30042482-detail/story.html|title=plans to convert housing complex|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110125715/http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/plans-to-convert-former-housing-complex-into-flats/story-30042482-detail/story.html#|archivedate=2017-01-10|access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref>  ''educational complex'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/about/maps-directions/isye-building-complex|title=isye building complex|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103001851/https://www.isye.gatech.edu/about/maps-directions/isye-building-complex|archivedate=2017-01-03}}</ref> ''hospital complex'', etc.\n\n== Creation ==\nThe practice of designing, constructing, and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of [[professional]]s and [[Tradesperson|trades]]. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project, the project team may include:\n\n* A [[real estate developer]] who secures [[funding]] for the project;\n* One or more financial institutions or other investors that provide the funding\n* Local planning and code authorities\n* A [[Quantity surveyor|Surveyor]] who performs an ALTA/ACSM and construction surveys throughout the project;\n* [[construction management|Construction manager]]s who coordinate the effort of different groups of project participants;\n* Licensed [[architect]]s and [[Architectural engineering|engineers]] who provide [[building design]] and prepare construction [[document]]s;\n* The principal design Engineering disciplines which would normally include the following professionals: Civil, Structural, Mechanical building services or HVAC (heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) Electrical Building Services, Plumbing and drainage. Also other possible design Engineer specialists may be involved such as Fire (prevention), Acoustic, facade engineers, building physics, Telecomms,     AV (Audio Visual), BMS (Building Management Systems) Automatic controls etc. These design Engineers also prepare construction documents which are issued to specialist contractors to obtain a price for the works and to follow for the installations.   \n* [[Landscape architect]]s;\n* [[Interior design]]ers;\n* Other consultants;\n* [[General contractor|Contractor]]s who provide [[construction]] services and install building systems such as [[HVAC|climate control]], [[Electrician|electrical]], [[plumbing]], [[Painter and decorator|Decoration]], [[fire protection]], [[security]] and [[telecommunications]];\n* Marketing or [[leasing]] agents;\n* [[facility management|Facility managers]] who are responsible for operating the building.\n\nRegardless of their size or intended use, all buildings in the US must comply with [[zoning ordinance]]s, [[building code]]s and other regulations such as [[fire code]]s, [[life safety code]]s and related standards.\n\nVehicles\u2014such as [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]], [[Travel trailer|caravans]], [[ship]]s and passenger [[aircraft]]\u2014are treated as \"buildings\" for life safety purposes.\n\n=== Ownership and funding ===\n* [[Mortgage loan]]\n* [[Real estate developer]]\n\n== Building services ==\n\n=== Physical plant ===\n{{Main|Physical plant}}\n[[File:The BB&T Building in Macon, Georgia.jpg|thumb|upright|The BB&T Building in [[Macon, Georgia]] is constructed of [[aluminum]].]]\nAny building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function, which includes such elements like heating / cooling, power and telecommunications, water and wastewater etc. Especially in [[commercial building]]s (such as offices or factories), these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space (sometimes located in separate areas or double floors / false ceilings) and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required.\n\n=== Conveying systems ===\n\nSystems for [[transport]] of people within buildings:\n\n* [[Elevator]]\n* [[Escalator]]\n* [[Moving sidewalk]] (horizontal and inclined)\n\nSystems for transport of people between interconnected buildings:\n\n* [[Skyway]]\n* [[Underground city]]\n\n== Building damage ==\n[[Image:Fire inside an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada.jpg|thumb|A building in [[Massueville]] ([[Quebec]], [[Canada]]), engulfed by [[fire]]]]\n\nBuildings may be damaged during the construction of the building or during maintenance.

To better understand the term ''building'' compare the list of [[nonbuilding structure]]s.\n\nBuildings serve several societal needs \u2013 primarily as shelter from weather, security, living space, privacy, to store belongings, and to comfortably live and work. A building as a shelter represents a physical division of the [[:Category:Human habitats|human habitat]] (a place of comfort and safety) and the ''outside'' (a place that at times may be harsh and harmful).\n\nEver since the first [[cave painting]]s, buildings have also become objects or canvasses of much artistic expression. In recent years, interest in [[sustainable]] planning and building practices has also become an intentional part of the design process of many new buildings.\n\n== Definitions ==\nThe word ''building'' is both a noun and a verb: the structure itself and the act of making it. As a noun, a building is 'a structure that has a roof and walls and stands more or less permanently in one place';<ref name=\"Egenhofer\">{{cite book|author=Max J.

In this photo its garden doesn't appear]]\n\n=== Residential ===\n{{main|List of human habitation forms}}\n\nSingle-family residential buildings are most often called [[house]]s or [[home]]s. Multi-family residential buildings containing more than one dwelling unit are called a [[Duplex (building)|duplex]] or an [[apartment]] building. A [[condominium]] is an apartment that the occupant owns rather than rents. Houses may also be built in pairs ([[semi-detached]]), in terraces where all but two of the houses have others either side; apartments may be built round courtyards or as rectangular blocks surrounded by a piece of ground of varying sizes. Houses which were built as a single dwelling may later be divided into apartments or [[bedsitter]]s; they may also be converted to another use e.g. an office or a shop.\n\nBuilding types may range from [[Hut (dwelling)|hut]]s to multimillion-dollar high-rise [[apartment block]]s able to house thousands of people. Increasing settlement density in buildings (and smaller distances between buildings) is usually a response to high ground prices resulting from many people wanting to live close to work or similar attractors. Other common [[building material]]s are brick, concrete or combinations of either of these with stone.\n\nResidential buildings have different names for their use depending if they are seasonal include [[holiday cottage]] (vacation home) or [[timeshare]]; size such as a [[cottage]] or [[great house]]; value such as a [[shack]] or [[mansion]]; manner of construction such as a [[log home]] or [[mobile home]]; proximity to the ground such as [[Earth sheltering|earth sheltered]] house, [[stilt house]], or [[tree house]]. Also if the residents are in need of special care such as a [[nursing home]], [[orphanage]] or [[prison]]; or in group housing like [[barracks]] or [[dormitory|dormitories]].\n\nHistorically many people lived in communal buildings called [[longhouse]]s, smaller dwellings called [[pit-house]]s and houses combined with barns sometimes called [[housebarn]]s.\n\nBuildings are defined to be substantial, permanent structures so other dwelling forms such as [[houseboat]]s, [[yurt]]s, and [[motorhome]]s are [[dwelling]]s but not buildings.\n\n=== Complex ===\nSometimes a group of inter-related (and possibly inter-connected) builds are referred to as a complex \u2013 for example a ''[[housing complex]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/plans-to-convert-former-housing-complex-into-flats/story-30042482-detail/story.html|title=plans to convert housing complex|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110125715/http://www.lincolnshirelive.co.uk/plans-to-convert-former-housing-complex-into-flats/story-30042482-detail/story.html#|archivedate=2017-01-10|access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref>  ''educational complex'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.isye.gatech.edu/about/maps-directions/isye-building-complex|title=isye building complex|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103001851/https://www.isye.gatech.edu/about/maps-directions/isye-building-complex|archivedate=2017-01-03}}</ref> ''hospital complex'', etc.\n\n== Creation ==\nThe practice of designing, constructing, and operating buildings is most usually a collective effort of different groups of [[professional]]s and [[Tradesperson|trades]]. Depending on the size, complexity, and purpose of a particular building project, the project team may include:\n\n* A [[real estate developer]] who secures [[funding]] for the project;\n* One or more financial institutions or other investors that provide the funding\n* Local planning and code authorities\n* A [[Quantity surveyor|Surveyor]] who performs an ALTA/ACSM and construction surveys throughout the project;\n* [[construction management|Construction manager]]s who coordinate the effort of different groups of project participants;\n* Licensed [[architect]]s and [[Architectural engineering|engineers]] who provide [[building design]] and prepare construction [[document]]s;\n* The principal design Engineering disciplines which would normally include the following professionals: Civil, Structural, Mechanical building services or HVAC (heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) Electrical Building Services, Plumbing and drainage. Also other possible design Engineer specialists may be involved such as Fire (prevention), Acoustic, facade engineers, building physics, Telecomms,     AV (Audio Visual), BMS (Building Management Systems) Automatic controls etc. These design Engineers also prepare construction documents which are issued to specialist contractors to obtain a price for the works and to follow for the installations.   \n* [[Landscape architect]]s;\n* [[Interior design]]ers;\n* Other consultants;\n* [[General contractor|Contractor]]s who provide [[construction]] services and install building systems such as [[HVAC|climate control]], [[Electrician|electrical]], [[plumbing]], [[Painter and decorator|Decoration]], [[fire protection]], [[security]] and [[telecommunications]];\n* Marketing or [[leasing]] agents;\n* [[facility management|Facility managers]] who are responsible for operating the building.\n\nRegardless of their size or intended use, all buildings in the US must comply with [[zoning ordinance]]s, [[building code]]s and other regulations such as [[fire code]]s, [[life safety code]]s and related standards.\n\nVehicles\u2014such as [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]], [[Travel trailer|caravans]], [[ship]]s and passenger [[aircraft]]\u2014are treated as \"buildings\" for life safety purposes.\n\n=== Ownership and funding ===\n* [[Mortgage loan]]\n* [[Real estate developer]]\n\n== Building services ==\n\n=== Physical plant ===\n{{Main|Physical plant}}\n[[File:The BB&T Building in Macon, Georgia.jpg|thumb|upright|The BB&T Building in [[Macon, Georgia]] is constructed of [[aluminum]].]]\nAny building requires a certain general amount of internal infrastructure to function, which includes such elements like heating / cooling, power and telecommunications, water and wastewater etc. Especially in [[commercial building]]s (such as offices or factories), these can be extremely intricate systems taking up large amounts of space (sometimes located in separate areas or double floors / false ceilings) and constitute a big part of the regular maintenance required.\n\n=== Conveying systems ===\n\nSystems for [[transport]] of people within buildings:\n\n* [[Elevator]]\n* [[Escalator]]\n* [[Moving sidewalk]] (horizontal and inclined)\n\nSystems for transport of people between interconnected buildings:\n\n* [[Skyway]]\n* [[Underground city]]\n\n== Building damage ==\n[[Image:Fire inside an abandoned convent in Massueville, Quebec, Canada.jpg|thumb|A building in [[Massueville]] ([[Quebec]], [[Canada]]), engulfed by [[fire]]]]\n\nBuildings may be damaged during the construction of the building or during maintenance.

They can range from simple [[dwelling]]s such as rudimentary [[hut]]s of [[nomadic tribes]] and the improvised [[shack]]s in [[shantytown]]s to complex, fixed structures of [[wood]], [[masonry]], [[concrete]] or other materials containing [[plumbing]], ventilation, and electrical systems.<ref name=schoenauer>Schoenauer, Norbert (2000). ''6,000 Years of Housing'' (rev. ed.) (New York: W.W.

Houses may have [[door]]s or [[lock (security device)|lock]]s to secure the dwelling space and protect its inhabitants and contents from [[burglar]]s or other trespassers. Most conventional modern houses in Western cultures will contain one or more [[bedroom]]s and [[bathroom]]s, a [[kitchen]] or cooking area, and a [[living room]]. A house may have a separate [[dining room]], or the eating area may be integrated into another room. Some large houses in North America have a [[recreation room]]. In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, [[List of domesticated animals|domestic animals]] such as chickens or larger livestock (like cattle) may share part of the house with humans. \n\nThe social unit that lives in a house is known as a [[household]]. Most commonly, a household is a [[family]] unit of some kind, although households may also be other [[Group (sociology)|social groups]], such as [[roommate]]s or, in a [[rooming house]], unconnected individuals. Some houses only have a dwelling space for one family or similar-sized group; larger houses called [[townhouse]]s or [[row house]]s may contain numerous family dwellings in the same structure. A house may be accompanied by outbuildings, such as a [[garage (residential)|garage]] for vehicles or a [[shed]] for gardening equipment and tools. A house may have a backyard or front yard, which serve as additional areas where inhabitants can relax or eat.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Beowulf - hus.jpg|thumb|left|Hus, an [[Old English]] word]]\nThe English word ''[[:wiktionary:house|house]]'' derives directly from the Old English ''hus'' meaning \"dwelling, shelter, home, house,\" which in turn derives from [[Proto-Germanic]] ''husan'' (reconstructed by etymological analysis) which is of unknown origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=house |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref> The house itself gave rise to the letter 'B' through an early [[Proto-Semitic language|Proto-Semitic]] [[hieroglyphic]] symbol depicting a house.

Where passages and staircases are used, as inevitably they are, they nearly always connect just one space to another and never serve as general distributors of movement. Thus, despite the precise architectural containment offered by the addition of room upon room, the villa was, in terms of occupation, an open plan, relatively permeable to the numerous members of the household.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Although very public, the open [[House plan|plan]] encouraged sociality and connectivity for all inhabitants.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAn early example of the segregation of rooms and consequent enhancement of privacy may be found in 1597 at the Beaufort House built in [[Chelsea, London]].

It was important for the Dutch to separate work from domesticity, as the home became an escape and a place of [[comfort]].

Some areas use brick almost exclusively, and quarried stone has long provided foundations and walls. To some extent, aluminum and steel have displaced some traditional [[building material]]s. Increasingly popular alternative construction materials include [[insulating concrete form]]s (foam forms filled with concrete), structural insulated panels (foam panels faced with [[oriented strand board]] or fiber cement), [[Cold-formed steel|light-gauge steel]], and [[Steel frame|steel framing]]. More generally, people often build houses out of the nearest available material, and often tradition or culture govern construction-materials, so whole towns, areas, counties or even states/countries may be built out of one main type of material. For example, a large portion of American houses use wood, while most British and many European houses use stone, brick, or mud.\n\n[[File:Construction maison bambou.jpg|thumb|Construction of a house using [[bamboo]]. Bamboo-made houses are popular in [[China]], [[Japan]] and other [[Asia]]n countries, because of their resistance to [[earthquakes]] and [[hurricanes]].]] \nIn the early 20th century, some house designers started using [[prefabrication]]. [[Sears, Roebuck & Co.]] first marketed their [[Sears Catalog Home]]s to the general public in 1908. Prefab techniques became popular after [[World War II]]. First small inside rooms framing, then later, whole walls were prefabricated and carried to the [[Construction|construction site]]. The original impetus was to use the [[labor force]] inside a shelter during inclement weather. More recently, builders have begun to collaborate with [[structural engineer]]s who use [[finite element analysis]] to design prefabricated steel-framed homes with known resistance to high [[Wind engineering|wind loads]] and [[Earthquake engineering|seismic forces]]. These newer products provide labor savings, more consistent quality, and possibly accelerated construction processes.\n\nLesser-used construction methods have gained (or regained) popularity in recent years. Though not in wide use, these methods frequently appeal to homeowners who may become actively involved in the construction process. They include:\n* [[Hempcrete|Cannabrick construction]]\n* [[Cordwood construction]]\n* [[Geodesic dome]]s\n* [[Straw-bale construction]]\n* [[Wattle and daub]]\n* {{vanchor|[[Timber framing]]}}\n* [[Framing (construction)]]\n\n[[File:Passivhaus thermogram gedaemmt ungedaemmt.png|thumb|Thermographic comparison of traditional (left) and \"[[passivhaus]]\" (right) buildings]]\nIn the developed world, [[energy conservation|energy-conservation]] has grown in importance in house design.

New houses in the UK are not covered by the [[Sale of Goods Act]]. When purchasing a new house the buyer has different legal protection than when buying other products. New houses in the UK are covered by a [[National House Building Council]] guarantee.\n\n== Identification and symbolism ==\nWith the growth of dense settlement, humans designed ways of identifying houses and [[Land lot|parcels]] of land. Individual houses sometimes acquire [[proper name]]s, and those names may acquire in their turn considerable emotional connotations. For example, the house of ''[[Howards End]]'' or the castle of ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]''. A more systematic and general approach to identifying houses may use various methods of [[house numbering]].\n\nHouses may express the circumstances or opinions of their builders or their inhabitants. Thus, a vast and elaborate house may serve as a sign of conspicuous wealth whereas a low-profile house built of recycled materials may indicate support of energy conservation. Houses of particular historical significance (former residences of the famous, for example, or even just very old houses) may gain a protected status in [[town planning]] as examples of built [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] or of streetscape. [[Commemorative plaques]] may mark such structures. [[Home ownership]] provides a common measure of [[prosperity]] in [[economics]].

Some larger properties may also feature rooms such as a spa room, indoor pool, indoor basketball court, and other 'non-essential' facilities. In traditional agriculture-oriented societies, domestic animals such as chickens or larger livestock often share part of the house with humans. Most conventional modern houses will at least contain a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen or cooking area, and a living room.\nThe names of parts of a house often echo the names of parts of other buildings, but could typically include:\n\n{{div col}}\n* [[Alcove (architecture)|Alcove]]\n* [[Atrium (architecture)|Atrium]]\n* [[Attic]]\n* [[Basement]]/[[Basement|cellar]]\n* [[Bathroom]]\n* [[Bedroom]] (or [[Nursery (room)|nursery]])\n* [[Box-room]] / storage room\n* [[Conservatory (greenhouse)|Conservatory]]\n* [[Dining room]]\n* [[Family room]] or [[den (room)|den]]\n* [[Fireplace]]\n* [[Foyer]]\n* [[Front room]]\n* [[Garage (house)|Garage]]\n* [[Hallway]] / [[Hall|passage]] / [[Vestibule (architecture)|Vestibule]]\n* [[Hearth]]\n* [[Home-office]] or [[study (room)|study]]\n* [[Kitchen]]\n* [[Larder]]\n* [[Laundry room]]\n* [[Library]]\n* [[Living room]]\n* [[Loft]]\n* [[wikt:nook|Nook]]\n* [[Pantry]]\n* [[Parlour]]\n* [[Pew]] / [[porch]]\n* [[Recreation room]] / [[rumpus room]] / [[television]] room\n* [[Shrine]]s to serve the religious functions associated with a family\n* [[Stairwell]]\n* [[Sunroom]]\n* [[Swimming pool]]\n* [[Window]]\n* [[Workshop]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== History ==\n[[File:HouseFlrPlan.svg|thumb|[[Floor plan]] of a \"[[American Foursquare|foursquare]]\" house]]\nLittle is known about the earliest origin of the house and its interior, however it can be traced back to the simplest form of shelters.

Furthermore, the houses accommodated numerous people, including family, relatives, employees, servants and their guests.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Their lifestyles were largely communal, as areas such as the [[Great Hall]] enforced the custom of dining and meetings and the [[Solar (room)|Solar]] intended for shared sleeping beds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/manor-house.htm |title=Manor House |publisher=Middle-ages.org.uk |date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[Italian Renaissance architecture|Italian Renaissance Palazzo]] consisted of plentiful rooms of connectivity. Unlike the qualities and uses of the Manor Houses, most rooms of the [[palazzo]] contained no purpose, yet were given several doors. These doors adjoined rooms in which [[Robin Evans]] describes as a \"matrix of discrete but thoroughly interconnected chambers.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Evans, Robin \u201cTranslations from Drawing to Building: Figures, Doors and Passages\u201d London: Architectural Associations Publications 2005</ref> The layout allowed occupants to freely walk room to room from one door to another, thus breaking the boundaries of [[privacy]]. \n:\"Once inside it is necessary to pass from one room to the next, then to the next to traverse the building. Where passages and staircases are used, as inevitably they are, they nearly always connect just one space to another and never serve as general distributors of movement. Thus, despite the precise architectural containment offered by the addition of room upon room, the villa was, in terms of occupation, an open plan, relatively permeable to the numerous members of the household.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> Although very public, the open [[House plan|plan]] encouraged sociality and connectivity for all inhabitants.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nAn early example of the segregation of rooms and consequent enhancement of privacy may be found in 1597 at the Beaufort House built in [[Chelsea, London]]. It was designed by English architect [[John Thorpe]] who wrote on his plans, \"A Long Entry through all\".<ref>Summerson, John \u201cThe Book Of Architecture of John Thorpe in Sit John Soan's museum: 40th Volume of the Walpole Society\u201d England: The Society 1964</ref> The separation of the passageway from the room developed the function of the [[Corridor (architecture)|corridor]]. This new extension was revolutionary at the time, allowing the integration of one door per room, in which all universally connected to the same corridor. [[English people|English]] architect [[Sir Roger Pratt]] states \"the common way in the middle through the whole length of the house, [avoids] the offices from one molesting the other by continual passing through them.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Pratt, Sir Roger \u201cSir R. Pratt on Architecture\u201d 1928</ref> [[Social hierarchies]] within the 17th century were highly regarded, as architecture was able to epitomize the servants and the upper class. More privacy is offered to the [[occupant]] as Pratt further claims, \"the ordinary servants may never publicly appear in passing to and fro for their occasions there.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> This social divide between rich and poor favored the physical integration of the corridor into housing by the 19th century.\n\nSociologist [[Witold Rybczynski]] wrote, \"the subdivision of the house into day and night uses, and into formal and informal areas, had begun.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Rybczynski |first=Witold |authorlink=Witold Rybczynski |title=Home: A Short History of An Idea |page=56 |location=London |publisher=Penguin |year=1987 |isbn=0-14-010231-0}}</ref> Rooms were changed from public to private as single entryways forced notions of entering a room with a specific purpose.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Industrial Revolution ===\nCompared to the large scaled houses in England and the Renaissance, the [[Dutch Golden Age|17th Century Dutch]] house was smaller, and was only inhabited by up to four to five members.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This was because they embraced \"self-reliance\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> in contrast to the dependence on servants, and a design for a lifestyle centered on the family. It was important for the Dutch to separate work from domesticity, as the home became an escape and a place of [[comfort]]. This way of living and the home has been noted as highly similar to the [[contemporary]] family and their dwellings. \n\nBy the end of the 17th century, the house layout was transformed to become employment-free, enforcing these ideas for the future. This came in favour for the [[industrial revolution]], gaining large-scale factory production and workers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The house layout of the Dutch and its functions are still relevant today.\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\n[[File:Doctor's residence and surgery, No 8 Milford Ave, Randwick taken for LJ Hooker Ltd by Sam Hood, 17 July 1951.

Some areas use brick almost exclusively, and quarried stone has long provided foundations and walls. To some extent, aluminum and steel have displaced some traditional [[building material]]s. Increasingly popular alternative construction materials include [[insulating concrete form]]s (foam forms filled with concrete), structural insulated panels (foam panels faced with [[oriented strand board]] or fiber cement), [[Cold-formed steel|light-gauge steel]], and [[Steel frame|steel framing]]. More generally, people often build houses out of the nearest available material, and often tradition or culture govern construction-materials, so whole towns, areas, counties or even states/countries may be built out of one main type of material. For example, a large portion of American houses use wood, while most British and many European houses use stone, brick, or mud.\n\n[[File:Construction maison bambou.jpg|thumb|Construction of a house using [[bamboo]]. Bamboo-made houses are popular in [[China]], [[Japan]] and other [[Asia]]n countries, because of their resistance to [[earthquakes]] and [[hurricanes]].]] \nIn the early 20th century, some house designers started using [[prefabrication]]. [[Sears, Roebuck & Co.]] first marketed their [[Sears Catalog Home]]s to the general public in 1908. Prefab techniques became popular after [[World War II]]. First small inside rooms framing, then later, whole walls were prefabricated and carried to the [[Construction|construction site]]. The original impetus was to use the [[labor force]] inside a shelter during inclement weather. More recently, builders have begun to collaborate with [[structural engineer]]s who use [[finite element analysis]] to design prefabricated steel-framed homes with known resistance to high [[Wind engineering|wind loads]] and [[Earthquake engineering|seismic forces]]. These newer products provide labor savings, more consistent quality, and possibly accelerated construction processes.\n\nLesser-used construction methods have gained (or regained) popularity in recent years. Though not in wide use, these methods frequently appeal to homeowners who may become actively involved in the construction process. They include:\n* [[Hempcrete|Cannabrick construction]]\n* [[Cordwood construction]]\n* [[Geodesic dome]]s\n* [[Straw-bale construction]]\n* [[Wattle and daub]]\n* {{vanchor|[[Timber framing]]}}\n* [[Framing (construction)]]\n\n[[File:Passivhaus thermogram gedaemmt ungedaemmt.png|thumb|Thermographic comparison of traditional (left) and \"[[passivhaus]]\" (right) buildings]]\nIn the developed world, [[energy conservation|energy-conservation]] has grown in importance in house design. Housing produces a major proportion of [[carbon emissions]] (studies have show that it is [[Energy efficiency in British housing|30% of the total in the United Kingdom]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/HomeAndCommunity/BuyingAndSellingYourHome/Energyperformancecertificates/DG_177026 |title=Energy Performance Certificates \u2013 what they are : Directgov \u2013 Home and community |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDevelopment of a number of [[:Category:low-energy building|low-energy building]] types and techniques continues. They include the [[zero-energy house]], the [[passive solar house]], the [[autonomous buildings]], the [[Superinsulation|superinsulated]] and houses built to the ''[[Passive house|Passivhaus]]'' standard.\n\n== Legal issues ==\n[[File:Vandergrift-Biddle House, Junction of US Route 13 and County Road 2, Saint Georges Hundred, Biddles Corner, New Castle County, DE HABS DEL,2-BIDCO,1- (sheet 1 of 8).png|thumb|Houses may be repeatedly expanded leading to a complex construction history.]]\nBuildings with historical importance have legal restrictions. New houses in the UK are not covered by the [[Sale of Goods Act]]. When purchasing a new house the buyer has different legal protection than when buying other products. New houses in the UK are covered by a [[National House Building Council]] guarantee.\n\n== Identification and symbolism ==\nWith the growth of dense settlement, humans designed ways of identifying houses and [[Land lot|parcels]] of land. Individual houses sometimes acquire [[proper name]]s, and those names may acquire in their turn considerable emotional connotations. For example, the house of ''[[Howards End]]'' or the castle of ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]''. A more systematic and general approach to identifying houses may use various methods of [[house numbering]].\n\nHouses may express the circumstances or opinions of their builders or their inhabitants. Thus, a vast and elaborate house may serve as a sign of conspicuous wealth whereas a low-profile house built of recycled materials may indicate support of energy conservation. Houses of particular historical significance (former residences of the famous, for example, or even just very old houses) may gain a protected status in [[town planning]] as examples of built [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] or of streetscape. [[Commemorative plaques]] may mark such structures. [[Home ownership]] provides a common measure of [[prosperity]] in [[economics]].
