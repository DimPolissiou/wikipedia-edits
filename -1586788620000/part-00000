It included a variety of games, performed by contestants between the ages of 10 and 13. The show itself was set in a fictional skyscraper (which was depicted in the titles by a London [[council house|council]] [[tower block]], [[Trellick Tower]], in [[North Kensington]]) with a talking lift.

The first game was where giant letters had to be fished out of a swimming pool (ostensibly a soup bowl) to make words on the \"fridge\". In the second game the contestants had to move from square to square on a chess board (they could only move one space per turn, and every forward movement had to be followed by a sidestep), until they reached the end. The catch was that the \"dark knight\" was attempting to stop them, though he could only see the player's last move which was lit up.\n\n==Transmissions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

In [[Canada]], Swedish Fish are distributed under Mondelez International's [[Maynards]] brand.\n\nThe fish are distributed in the U.S. by Mondel\u0113z International. The fish-shaped candy gained enough popularity on its own to where the [[Malaco]], and later [[Cadbury]], company had to do little advertising for the product, until this past decade. A recent resurgence in popularity has resulted in greater accessibility in supermarkets and convenience stores where they are often sold prepackaged in plastic bags. Building upon this resurgence, the company recently created \"Giant Fish\" television advertisements and a \"Treadin' Water\" [[YouTube]] mini-series, which follows the miscellaneous adventures of four friends and a Giant Swedish Fish sharing an apartment. The first few episodes of the mini-series were published onto YouTube on May 9, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChiAF4Yif-6sS9UeDEZdHdQ|title=Swedish Fish|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n\nOriginally colored red with a flavor unique to the candy (often guessed to be [[lingonberry]], but never verified), they are now also available in several different colors, such as Orange & Lemon-Lime. Purple Swedish Fish in [[grape]] flavor were discontinued in 2006. The fish come in two different sizes. Initially, the smaller fish came only in red; now fish of both sizes are available in all flavors. According to a visit to the factory on the [[Food Network]]'s show ''[[Unwrapped]]''{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, green is not lime, but [[pineapple]] flavor, while yellow is a [[lemon-lime]] flavor.\n\n== History ==\nAlthough well known in the U.S., Swedish Fish were only launched on the U.S. market in the late 1950s. The original owner of these candies was the Swedish company Malaco, who wanted to expand its sales to North America. Wanting to create a product that reflected the culture of Sweden in some way, a fish-shaped gummy candy was created. Fishing was and is still a large part of Sweden's culture, and fish is a considerable part of the Swedish diet. Mondelez distributes the candy in the U.S. today, but the fish gummies are still distributed by Malaco in Sweden.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/23125/brief-history-swedish-fish|title=A Brief History of Swedish Fish|date=2009-10-28|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nIn 2009, [[Rita's Italian Ice]], a U.S. chain which serves [[Italian ice]] and [[frozen custard]], introduced a red Swedish Fish flavored Italian ice as a [[brand alliances|cobranded]] product.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ritasice.com/ritas-introduces-highly-anticipated-swedish-fish-italian-ice-flavor/|title=Rita\u2019s Introduces Highly-Anticipated Swedish Fish\u00ae Italian Ice Flavor {{!}} Rita's Italian Ice|website=www.ritasice.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Trident (gum)|Trident]], a gum company owned by Mondelez Global, produced a Swedish Fish flavored product, which is advertised as \"Berry + Lemon\" flavor.\n\nIn 2016, [[Nabisco]] created a test-market product Swedish Fish Oreos, available at [[Kroger]] grocery stores in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/food/we-tried-swedish-fish-oreos-here-s-what-we-thought-t101768|title=This is what happened when we tried Swedish Fish Oreos|first=Alessandra|last=Bulow|work=today.com}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Swedish fish}}\n* [http://www.originalswedishfish.com/ The Original Swedish Fish] website, run by [[Cadbury|Cadbury Adams]]\n\n{{Mondelez}}\n\n[[Category:Cadbury Adams brands]]\n[[Category:Brand name confectionery]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1958]]\n[[Category:Fish in human culture]]\n[[Category:Candy]]\n[[Category:Mondel\u0113z brands]]\n[[Category:Swedish confectionery]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the candy|genuine fish in Sweden|List of fish in Sweden}}\n{{Infobox food\n| name             = Swedish Fish\n| image            = Swedish-Fish-Wrapper-Small.jpg\n| image_size       = 300px\n| caption          = Swedish Fish wrapper\n| alternate_name   = \n| country          = [[Sweden]]\n| creator          = [[Malaco]]\n| type             = [[Confectionery]]\n| main_ingredient  = [[Sugar]], [[invert sugar]], [[corn syrup]], [[corn starch]], [[citric acid]]\n}}\n[[File:Swedishfish.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright|Three Swedish Fish: yellow, green, and red.

A recent resurgence in popularity has resulted in greater accessibility in supermarkets and convenience stores where they are often sold prepackaged in plastic bags. Building upon this resurgence, the company recently created \"Giant Fish\" television advertisements and a \"Treadin' Water\" [[YouTube]] mini-series, which follows the miscellaneous adventures of four friends and a Giant Swedish Fish sharing an apartment. The first few episodes of the mini-series were published onto YouTube on May 9, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChiAF4Yif-6sS9UeDEZdHdQ|title=Swedish Fish|website=YouTube|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n\nOriginally colored red with a flavor unique to the candy (often guessed to be [[lingonberry]], but never verified), they are now also available in several different colors, such as Orange & Lemon-Lime. Purple Swedish Fish in [[grape]] flavor were discontinued in 2006. The fish come in two different sizes. Initially, the smaller fish came only in red; now fish of both sizes are available in all flavors. According to a visit to the factory on the [[Food Network]]'s show ''[[Unwrapped]]''{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}, green is not lime, but [[pineapple]] flavor, while yellow is a [[lemon-lime]] flavor.\n\n== History ==\nAlthough well known in the U.S., Swedish Fish were only launched on the U.S. market in the late 1950s. The original owner of these candies was the Swedish company Malaco, who wanted to expand its sales to North America. Wanting to create a product that reflected the culture of Sweden in some way, a fish-shaped gummy candy was created. Fishing was and is still a large part of Sweden's culture, and fish is a considerable part of the Swedish diet. Mondelez distributes the candy in the U.S. today, but the fish gummies are still distributed by Malaco in Sweden.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/23125/brief-history-swedish-fish|title=A Brief History of Swedish Fish|date=2009-10-28|access-date=2017-04-03|language=en}}</ref>\n\n=== Partnerships ===\nIn 2009, [[Rita's Italian Ice]], a U.S. chain which serves [[Italian ice]] and [[frozen custard]], introduced a red Swedish Fish flavored Italian ice as a [[brand alliances|cobranded]] product.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ritasice.com/ritas-introduces-highly-anticipated-swedish-fish-italian-ice-flavor/|title=Rita\u2019s Introduces Highly-Anticipated Swedish Fish\u00ae Italian Ice Flavor {{!}} Rita's Italian Ice|website=www.ritasice.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Trident (gum)|Trident]], a gum company owned by Mondelez Global, produced a Swedish Fish flavored product, which is advertised as \"Berry + Lemon\" flavor.\n\nIn 2016, [[Nabisco]] created a test-market product Swedish Fish Oreos, available at [[Kroger]] grocery stores in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/food/we-tried-swedish-fish-oreos-here-s-what-we-thought-t101768|title=This is what happened when we tried Swedish Fish Oreos|first=Alessandra|last=Bulow|work=today.com}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons category-inline|Swedish fish}}\n* [http://www.originalswedishfish.com/ The Original Swedish Fish] website, run by [[Cadbury|Cadbury Adams]]\n\n{{Mondelez}}\n\n[[Category:Cadbury Adams brands]]\n[[Category:Brand name confectionery]]\n[[Category:Products introduced in 1958]]\n[[Category:Fish in human culture]]\n[[Category:Candy]]\n[[Category:Mondel\u0113z brands]]\n[[Category:Swedish confectionery]]\n", "name_user": "AMTerpsy", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added \"gluten-free\" in the first paragraph.
