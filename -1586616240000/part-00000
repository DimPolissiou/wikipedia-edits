The film stars [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Charlie Hunnam]], [[Henry Golding]], [[Michelle Dockery]], [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]], [[Eddie Marsan]], [[Colin Farrell]] and [[Hugh Grant]]. It follows an American marijuana kingpin in England who is looking to sell his business, setting off a chain of blackmail and schemes to undermine him.\n\n''The Gentlemen'' premiered at the [[Curzon Mayfair Cinema]] on December&nbsp;3, 2019,<ref>MarketMeets.

[https://markmeets.com/film-premieres-2019/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102195605/https://markmeets.com/film-premieres-2019/ |date=January 2, 2020 }}</ref> and was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on January&nbsp;1, 2020, and in the United States on January&nbsp;24, 2020, by [[STX Entertainment|STXfilms]]. It received positive reviews from critics, with many regarding it as a welcome return to form for Ritchie. It grossed $115 million worldwide, and is currently the [[2020 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth highest-grossing film of 2020]].\n\n==Plot==\nBig Dave, editor of the ''Daily Print'' [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], is snubbed by cannabis baron Mickey Pearson at a party and hires private investigator Fletcher, to investigate Pearson's links to Lord Pressfield, a [[Royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom|Royal Duke]] with a heroin-addicted daughter. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled ''Bush'') to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond, for \u00a320,000,000.\n\nBorn in poverty in the United States, Pearson won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Oxford University]], where he began selling marijuana to fellow students before dropping out and building up his criminal enterprise by violence. He plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for $400,000,000 so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their [[English country house|stately homes]]. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson.\n\nPearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates. He also agrees to bring home Pressfield's wayward daughter Laura. Raymond retrieves Laura from a [[council estate]] where she is living with several other addicts. However, in a brawl with her flatmates one of Raymond's men accidentally pushes Aslan, a young Russian man, out of the window to his death. Laura later dies of a heroin overdose. Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his students' actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed Coach's crew about the lab location, although Phuc is accidentally killed during a botched escape attempt when he jumps off a balcony but lands into the path of an oncoming train. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab, and destroys one of his heroin labs in retaliation. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George nods to a henchman to execute Dry Eye, but the man executes George instead.\n\nUnknown to Pearson, Dry Eye is in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills Dry Eye's men before she runs out of bullets in her two-shot [[derringer]]. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye as he is about to rape her. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house.\n\nFletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders Coach's students to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him [[Zoophilia|having sex with a pig]], threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to $130,000,000 but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a refrigerator, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers $270,000,000 compensation and, for the assault on Rosalind, cuts \"a [[pound of flesh]]\" from his own body.\n\nFletcher approaches Raymond again for his payment, but Raymond reveals that he was tailing Fletcher all along. The fighters have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker on him during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals that he has also sold info to Aslan's father, a [[Russian oligarch]] and former KGB agent. The assassin that Raymond earlier killed was one of the Russians. Coach kills two Russian hitmen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are quickly ambushed by Coach's students who want to \"solve Coach's problem\". They assault the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to [[Miramax]]. After his meeting, he gets into a cab only to realise that Raymond is the driver. Upon learning of Fletcher's capture, Pearson and Rosalind return to their cannabis empire and celebrate in each other's company.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Michael 'Mickey' Pearson\n* [[Charlie Hunnam]] as Raymond Smith\n* [[Henry Golding]] as Dry Eye\n* [[Michelle Dockery]] as Rosalind Pearson\n* [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]] as Matthew Berger\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Coach\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Fletcher\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Big Dave\n* Chidi Ajufo as Bunny\n* [[Jason Wong]] as Phuc\n* Brittany Ashworth as Ruby\n* [[Samuel West]] as Lord Pressfield\n* [[Eliot Sumner]] as Laura Pressfield\n* [[Lyne Ren\u00e9e]] as Jackie\n* [[Chris Evangelou]] as Primetime\n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Benny\n* [[Bugzy Malone]] as Ernie\n* [[Tom Wu]] as Lord George\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIt was announced in May 2018 that [[Guy Ritchie]] would write and direct ''The Gentlemen'', a film that would be in the same spirit as his earlier ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' and ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]''.

The film stars [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Charlie Hunnam]], [[Henry Golding]], [[Michelle Dockery]], [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]], [[Eddie Marsan]], [[Colin Farrell]] and [[Hugh Grant]]. It follows an American marijuana kingpin in England who is looking to sell his business, setting off a chain of blackmail and schemes to undermine him.\n\n''The Gentlemen'' premiered at the [[Curzon Mayfair Cinema]] on December&nbsp;3, 2019,<ref>MarketMeets. Film Premieres 2019. [https://markmeets.com/film-premieres-2019/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102195605/https://markmeets.com/film-premieres-2019/ |date=January 2, 2020 }}</ref> and was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on January&nbsp;1, 2020, and in the United States on January&nbsp;24, 2020, by [[STX Entertainment|STXfilms]]. It received positive reviews from critics, with many regarding it as a welcome return to form for Ritchie. It grossed $115 million worldwide, and is currently the [[2020 in film#Highest-grossing films|sixth highest-grossing film of 2020]].\n\n==Plot==\nBig Dave, editor of the ''Daily Print'' [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]], is snubbed by cannabis baron Mickey Pearson at a party and hires private investigator Fletcher, to investigate Pearson's links to Lord Pressfield, a [[Royal dukedoms in the United Kingdom|Royal Duke]] with a heroin-addicted daughter. Fletcher offers to sell his findings (typed up as a screenplay entitled ''Bush'') to Pearson's right-hand man, Raymond, for \u00a320,000,000.\n\nBorn in poverty in the United States, Pearson won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[Oxford University]], where he began selling marijuana to fellow students before dropping out and building up his criminal enterprise by violence. He plans to sell his business to American billionaire Matthew Berger for $400,000,000 so he can retire peacefully with his wife, Rosalind. Pearson shows Berger one of the labs where he grows his cannabis under the estates of aristocratic landlords, who need cash for the upkeep of their [[English country house|stately homes]]. Pearson is later approached by Dry Eye, an underboss for Chinese gangster Lord George. Dry Eye offers to buy out Pearson's business, but he refuses. Pearson's lab is then raided by amateur [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] fighters and aspiring YouTubers \"The Toddlers\" who overpower the lab's guards, steal a van-load of marijuana and upload a rap video of their caper online. The fighters' trainer, known only as Coach, orders them to delete the video and is horrified when he discovers that the cannabis belongs to Pearson.\n\nPearson begins transferring his cannabis plants out of the estates. He also agrees to bring home Pressfield's wayward daughter Laura. Raymond retrieves Laura from a [[council estate]] where she is living with several other addicts. However, in a brawl with her flatmates one of Raymond's men accidentally pushes Aslan, a young Russian man, out of the window to his death. Laura later dies of a heroin overdose. Coach visits Raymond, apologises for his students' actions, and offers his services as penance. Coach has captured Phuc, a henchman of Dry Eye's who had informed Coach's crew about the lab location, although Phuc is accidentally killed during a botched escape attempt when he jumps off a balcony but lands into the path of an oncoming train. Pearson threatens Lord George for going after his lab, and destroys one of his heroin labs in retaliation. George chastises Dry Eye for his insubordination in attacking Pearson and offering to buy him out; George nods to a henchman to execute Dry Eye, but the man executes George instead.\n\nUnknown to Pearson, Dry Eye is in league with Berger, who had wanted Pearson's business disrupted to reduce the price. Dry Eye has taken Lord George's place and still hopes to take Pearson's empire for himself. Dry Eye tries to kidnap Rosalind, who kills Dry Eye's men before she runs out of bullets in her two-shot [[derringer]]. Raymond kills an assassin sent to kill Pearson; the two rush to Rosalind and Pearson kills Dry Eye as he is about to rape her. Fletcher ends his story and Raymond orders him to leave his house.\n\nFletcher has merely confirmed Pearson's suspicions about the link between Dry Eye and Berger. Raymond orders Coach's students to capture Big Dave. They drug him and film him [[Zoophilia|having sex with a pig]], threatening to post it online unless he drops his investigation. Pearson and Berger meet up again in a frozen fish plant, actually a cover for Pearson's European distribution operation. Berger drops his offer to $130,000,000 but Pearson reveals his knowledge of Berger's plan, shows him Dry Eye's frozen body and tells him he is keeping his business. Pearson forces Berger inside a refrigerator, where he will freeze to death unless he transfers $270,000,000 compensation and, for the assault on Rosalind, cuts \"a [[pound of flesh]]\" from his own body.\n\nFletcher approaches Raymond again for his payment, but Raymond reveals that he was tailing Fletcher all along. The fighters have stolen his stashes of evidence after Raymond placed a tracker on him during their last encounter. Fletcher reveals that he has also sold info to Aslan's father, a [[Russian oligarch]] and former KGB agent. The assassin that Raymond earlier killed was one of the Russians. Coach kills two Russian hitmen sent to kill Raymond, while Fletcher escapes in the chaos. Pearson is kidnapped by two other Russians, but they are quickly ambushed by Coach's students who want to \"solve Coach's problem\". They assault the car with bullets, killing the Russians and allowing Pearson to escape. Later, Fletcher decides to pitch the story as a film to [[Miramax]]. After his meeting, he gets into a cab only to realise that Raymond is the driver. Upon learning of Fletcher's capture, Pearson and Rosalind return to their cannabis empire and celebrate in each other's company.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Matthew McConaughey]] as Michael 'Mickey' Pearson\n* [[Charlie Hunnam]] as Raymond Smith\n* [[Henry Golding]] as Dry Eye\n* [[Michelle Dockery]] as Rosalind Pearson\n* [[Jeremy Strong (actor)|Jeremy Strong]] as Matthew Berger\n* [[Colin Farrell]] as Coach\n* [[Hugh Grant]] as Fletcher\n* [[Eddie Marsan]] as Big Dave\n* Chidi Ajufo as Bunny\n* [[Jason Wong]] as Phuc\n* Brittany Ashworth as Ruby\n* [[Samuel West]] as Lord Pressfield\n* [[Eliot Sumner]] as Laura Pressfield\n* [[Lyne Ren\u00e9e]] as Jackie\n* [[Chris Evangelou]] as Primetime\n* [[Franz Drameh]] as Benny\n* [[Bugzy Malone]] as Ernie\n* [[Tom Wu]] as Lord George\n}}\n\n==Production==\nIt was announced in May 2018 that [[Guy Ritchie]] would write and direct ''The Gentlemen'', a film that would be in the same spirit as his earlier ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' and ''[[Snatch (film)|Snatch]]''.

It covers parts of five canals, and includes passage through the [[Standedge Tunnels|longest canal tunnel]] in Britain. It has only been possible to cruise it since 2002, when restoration of the [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]] provided the return route across the Pennines.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a canal ring was created in 1965, as part of a campaign by the [[Inland Waterways Association]] to prevent the complete closure of the [[Rochdale Canal]]. Initially the canal was described as part of the \"Cheshire Canal Ring\", which was soon shortened to the \"[[Cheshire Ring]]\". It described a series of interconnecting canals which could be navigated, usually in a week or two, without having to cover any section twice, and has subsequently been applied to several other such routes.<ref>{{harvnb |Shead |2004}}</ref> The South Pennine Ring is a recent addition, as it was only with the restoration of the [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]] (dubbed ''the impossible restoration'') and the [[Rochdale Canal]] in 2001-2002 that the ring became a possibility.\n\nThe term was coined as a marketing tool by [[British Waterways]], and was later taken up by waterways enthusiasts in coining the [[North Pennine Ring]] and [[Outer Pennine Ring]] to describe the three possible rings that incorporate the three transpennine canals.\n\n==Popularity==\nThe [[moorland]] scenery and apparent isolation of the upper reaches of the ring would normally be a big attraction to leisure boaters, but boater numbers are relatively small due to a number of factors. These include\n*the large numbers of locks, which are not generally clustered in flights\n*unpredictable and planned engineering '''stoppages''' (as temporary closures are called on English canals), caused by water shortages, bank failures and maintenance work\n*some densely urban sections being unpopular with people seeking rural England\n*operating restrictions on the number of boats that can pass through the Standedge Tunnel.\n\nAs a result of the frequent stoppages and the need to book passage through the Standedge Tunnel, planning for a trip on the Huddersfield Narrow or Rochdale canals should include consulting the  [http://www.waterscape.com British Waterways website].\n\n==Route==\nThe South Pennine Ring follows parts of the following canals starting from Ducie St Junction in [[Manchester]], and proceeding clockwise around the ring.\n\n*[[Rochdale Canal]]\n*[[Calder and Hebble Navigation]]\n*[[Huddersfield Broad Canal]]\n*[[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]]\n*[[Ashton Canal]]\n\n===Rochdale Canal===\nThe Rochdale Canal was authorised in 1794 and completed in 1804. Unlike the other two trans-Pennine canals, it does not have a major tunnel, but has to climb higher as a consequence, and the large number of locks, which were able to take wide-beam barges up to {{convert|14|ft|m}} wide, used a prodigious amount of water, which often presented problems. The last commercial boat to travel from one end of the canal to the other did so in 1937, and most of the canal except for the section below Ducie St Junction, which is not part of the canal ring, was closed in 1952. Restoration began in 1984, and was completed in 2002 with the aid of a grant from the Millennium Fund. The canal remained in private ownership until 2000, and has been the responsibility of [[British Waterways]] since it reopened.<ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=163}}</ref><ref name=jane255>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=255\u2013258}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, there were eight reservoirs which supplied water to the canal, but these were sold to water supply companies when the canal was closed, and so water supply is again a problem. For this reason, passage through the first 19 locks above Ducie St Junction, starting with lock 83, is restricted to four boats per day in each direction, and must be booked in advance. Making progress along the canal is hard work, as there are three locks per mile (5 locks per km), but they are spread out, rather than being organised into flights. There are a total of 47 locks between Ducie Street and the summit level, all constructed with the same rise, as a way to conserve water and to make the lock gates interchangeable. By the time West Summit Lock is reached, boats have travelled {{convert|17|mi|km}} and ascended to a height of {{convert|601|ft|m}}, make this one of the highest canal summits in the country. Passage over the summit, between locks 37 to the west and 36 to the east, must again be booked and only four boats per day can make the passage in each direction. Although the lock at the western end of the summit is called West Summit Lock, the canal is actually travelling in a north to south direction at this point. The summit is quite short, at just {{convert|0.8|mi|km}}, and the descent to Sowerby Bridge begins all too soon.<ref name=jane255/><ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |pp=166, 173}}</ref>\n\nThe distance from Ducie Street to Sowerby Bridge is {{convert|30.8|mi|km}} and there are 82 locks. The discrepancy between the locks and their numbers is because Tuel Lane Lock, just before Sowerby Bridge, was built as a single lock to replace the original locks 3 and 4, in order to give sufficient headroom as the canal passed under a road junction.<ref name=jane255/> Sowerby Bridge was historically a transshipment point, as the barges on the Calder and Hebble Navigation were only {{convert|56|ft|m}} long, and this still restricts the size of boats that can complete the ring.<ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=48}}</ref>\n\n===Calder and Hebble Navigation===\nThe Calder and Hebble Navigation opened between [[Wakefield]] and Sowerby Bridge in 1770, almost as an extension to the [[Aire and Calder Navigation]]. It was never as successful as the Aire and Calder, and was leased by a railway company for a time, until the Aire and Calder took over the lease. Some of the lower locks were enlarged during this period, but this did not include any that form part of the South Pennine Ring. Commercial traffic lasted until 1981, and it is now used entirely for leisure boating. One unusual feature of the waterway is the need for a long piece of wood, called a handspike, to open the paddles on the locks. Because it is a river navigation, water levels are liable to fluctuate, and many of the locks have coloured gauge boards to indicate if it is safe to proceed. A green band indicates that river levels are normal, while an amber band indicates that river levels are high, but that progress to the next lock and passage through it should be possible with care. A red band indicates that navigation is unsafe, as the river is in flood, and the next lock is closed.<ref name=jane89>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=89\u201391}}</ref>\n\nWhen the river levels are normal, travelling along the canal is a pleasant experience, as the route passes through areas of beautiful countryside and other areas with interesting industrial archaeology. After {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} and 14 locks, the channel forks. The Calder and Hebble proceeds straight ahead through Cooper Bridge flood gates to reach the Aire and Calder at Wakefield. That route is part of the North Pennine Ring, which uses the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] to re-cross the Pennines. The South Pennine Ring takes a left turn onto the [[Huddersfield Broad Canal]]. Care is needed as there is a large weir beside the entrance to the first lock.<ref name=jane89/><ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=61}}</ref>\n\n===Huddersfield Broad Canal===\nThe Huddersfield Broad Canal is relatively short, at just {{convert|3.3|mi|km}}, and ascends through 9 locks to connect the Calder and Hebble to the industrial centre of Huddersfield. It was opened in 1780, and features short wide locks, as its only outlet was via Cooper Bridge when it was built. Despite the proximity of towns the route feels quite rural, with wooded banks and playing fields close by. It reaches Aspley Basin after passing the Locomotive Lift Bridge, named because of its shape rather than its function, as it carries a road over the canal. The basin was required once the Huddersfield Narrow Canal opened, as boats using either canal could not proceed along the other.<ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |pp=59\u201361}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=149\u2013150}}</ref>\n\n===Huddersfield Narrow Canal===\nThe Huddersfield Narrow Canal was the third of the trans-Pennine routes to open. It was authorised at the same time as the Rochdale Canal, but had a long tunnel on the summit level, and was not fully opened until 1811, seven years after the Rochdale. [[Standedge Tunnels|Standedge tunnel]] is the longest canal tunnel in Britain, and also the highest, as the summit level is {{convert|656|ft|m}} above sea level. This is higher than the summit of the Rochdale, and yet it is also the deepest canal tunnel, as it is {{convert|638|ft|m}} below Saddleworth Moor in places.<ref name=nic50>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |pp=50\u201358}}</ref><ref name=jane150>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=150\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nThe canal is {{convert|19.9|mi|km}} long, with 42 locks, numbered 1E to 42E up to the summit level, and another 32, numbered 32W to 1W on the descent to Dukinfield Junction.<ref name=jane150/> Near to Huddersfield there are two tunnels, constructed to take the reinstated canal under factories which were built after it closed in 1944. Bates Tunnel is {{convert|100|yd|m}} long, and Sellers Tunnel is {{convert|355|yd|m}} long.<ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=60}}</ref> As on the Rochdale, the locks are spread out rather than occurring in flights. Between the top lock and the north-east portal of Standedge Tunnel there is around {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} of level canal. Near the tunnel mouth is an information centre. There are four tunnels running through the hills at this point, as the canal tunnel is paralleled by three railway tunnels. Passage through the tunnel must be booked in advance, and is limited to a convoy of four boats in each direction on days when the tunnel is open.<ref name=jane150/>\n\nThe reconstruction of the canal has made big changes to places such as [[Stalybridge]], where the canal was culverted in 1947. Now the new canal threads through the streets, and it is appreciated for the vibrancy it has created. Below the final lock is another tunnel, {{convert|166|yd|m}} long, which carries the canal under an Asda supermarket to reach Dukinfield Junction.<ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Ashton Canal===\nAt Dukinfield Junction, the [[Peak Forest Canal]] turns to the left, but the South Pennine Ring continues straight ahead onto the Ashton Canal. The first half is level, until Fairfield Junction is reached. This was the point at which the [[Hollinwood Canal]] turned off.

It covers parts of five canals, and includes passage through the [[Standedge Tunnels|longest canal tunnel]] in Britain. It has only been possible to cruise it since 2002, when restoration of the [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]] provided the return route across the Pennines.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a canal ring was created in 1965, as part of a campaign by the [[Inland Waterways Association]] to prevent the complete closure of the [[Rochdale Canal]]. Initially the canal was described as part of the \"Cheshire Canal Ring\", which was soon shortened to the \"[[Cheshire Ring]]\". It described a series of interconnecting canals which could be navigated, usually in a week or two, without having to cover any section twice, and has subsequently been applied to several other such routes.<ref>{{harvnb |Shead |2004}}</ref> The South Pennine Ring is a recent addition, as it was only with the restoration of the [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]] (dubbed ''the impossible restoration'') and the [[Rochdale Canal]] in 2001-2002 that the ring became a possibility.\n\nThe term was coined as a marketing tool by [[British Waterways]], and was later taken up by waterways enthusiasts in coining the [[North Pennine Ring]] and [[Outer Pennine Ring]] to describe the three possible rings that incorporate the three transpennine canals.\n\n==Popularity==\nThe [[moorland]] scenery and apparent isolation of the upper reaches of the ring would normally be a big attraction to leisure boaters, but boater numbers are relatively small due to a number of factors. These include\n*the large numbers of locks, which are not generally clustered in flights\n*unpredictable and planned engineering '''stoppages''' (as temporary closures are called on English canals), caused by water shortages, bank failures and maintenance work\n*some densely urban sections being unpopular with people seeking rural England\n*operating restrictions on the number of boats that can pass through the Standedge Tunnel.\n\nAs a result of the frequent stoppages and the need to book passage through the Standedge Tunnel, planning for a trip on the Huddersfield Narrow or Rochdale canals should include consulting the  [http://www.waterscape.com British Waterways website].\n\n==Route==\nThe South Pennine Ring follows parts of the following canals starting from Ducie St Junction in [[Manchester]], and proceeding clockwise around the ring.\n\n*[[Rochdale Canal]]\n*[[Calder and Hebble Navigation]]\n*[[Huddersfield Broad Canal]]\n*[[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]]\n*[[Ashton Canal]]\n\n===Rochdale Canal===\nThe Rochdale Canal was authorised in 1794 and completed in 1804. Unlike the other two trans-Pennine canals, it does not have a major tunnel, but has to climb higher as a consequence, and the large number of locks, which were able to take wide-beam barges up to {{convert|14|ft|m}} wide, used a prodigious amount of water, which often presented problems. The last commercial boat to travel from one end of the canal to the other did so in 1937, and most of the canal except for the section below Ducie St Junction, which is not part of the canal ring, was closed in 1952. Restoration began in 1984, and was completed in 2002 with the aid of a grant from the Millennium Fund. The canal remained in private ownership until 2000, and has been the responsibility of [[British Waterways]] since it reopened.<ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=163}}</ref><ref name=jane255>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=255\u2013258}}</ref>\n\nOriginally, there were eight reservoirs which supplied water to the canal, but these were sold to water supply companies when the canal was closed, and so water supply is again a problem. For this reason, passage through the first 19 locks above Ducie St Junction, starting with lock 83, is restricted to four boats per day in each direction, and must be booked in advance. Making progress along the canal is hard work, as there are three locks per mile (5 locks per km), but they are spread out, rather than being organised into flights. There are a total of 47 locks between Ducie Street and the summit level, all constructed with the same rise, as a way to conserve water and to make the lock gates interchangeable. By the time West Summit Lock is reached, boats have travelled {{convert|17|mi|km}} and ascended to a height of {{convert|601|ft|m}}, make this one of the highest canal summits in the country. Passage over the summit, between locks 37 to the west and 36 to the east, must again be booked and only four boats per day can make the passage in each direction. Although the lock at the western end of the summit is called West Summit Lock, the canal is actually travelling in a north to south direction at this point. The summit is quite short, at just {{convert|0.8|mi|km}}, and the descent to Sowerby Bridge begins all too soon.<ref name=jane255/><ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |pp=166, 173}}</ref>\n\nThe distance from Ducie Street to Sowerby Bridge is {{convert|30.8|mi|km}} and there are 82 locks. The discrepancy between the locks and their numbers is because Tuel Lane Lock, just before Sowerby Bridge, was built as a single lock to replace the original locks 3 and 4, in order to give sufficient headroom as the canal passed under a road junction.<ref name=jane255/> Sowerby Bridge was historically a transshipment point, as the barges on the Calder and Hebble Navigation were only {{convert|56|ft|m}} long, and this still restricts the size of boats that can complete the ring.<ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=48}}</ref>\n\n===Calder and Hebble Navigation===\nThe Calder and Hebble Navigation opened between [[Wakefield]] and Sowerby Bridge in 1770, almost as an extension to the [[Aire and Calder Navigation]]. It was never as successful as the Aire and Calder, and was leased by a railway company for a time, until the Aire and Calder took over the lease. Some of the lower locks were enlarged during this period, but this did not include any that form part of the South Pennine Ring. Commercial traffic lasted until 1981, and it is now used entirely for leisure boating. One unusual feature of the waterway is the need for a long piece of wood, called a handspike, to open the paddles on the locks. Because it is a river navigation, water levels are liable to fluctuate, and many of the locks have coloured gauge boards to indicate if it is safe to proceed. A green band indicates that river levels are normal, while an amber band indicates that river levels are high, but that progress to the next lock and passage though it should be possible with care. A red band indicates that navigation is unsafe, as the river is in flood, and the next lock is closed.<ref name=jane89>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=89\u201391}}</ref>\n\nWhen the river levels are normal, travelling along the canal is a pleasant experience, as the route passes through areas of beautiful countryside and other areas with interesting industrial archaeology. After {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} and 14 locks, the channel forks. The Calder and Hebble proceeds straight ahead through Cooper Bridge flood gates to reach the Aire and Calder at Wakefield. That route is part of the North Pennine Ring, which uses the [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]] to re-cross the Pennines. The South Pennine Ring takes a left turn onto the [[Huddersfield Broad Canal]]. Care is needed as there is a large weir beside the entrance to the first lock.<ref name=jane89/><ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=61}}</ref>\n\n===Huddersfield Broad Canal===\nThe Huddersfield Broad Canal is relatively short, at just {{convert|3.3|mi|km}}, and ascends through 9 locks to connect the Calder and Hebble to the industrial centre of Huddersfield. It was opened in 1780, and features short wide locks, as its only outlet was via Cooper Bridge when it was built. Despite the proximity of towns the route feels quite rural, with wooded banks and playing fields close by. It reaches Aspley Basin after passing the Locomotive Lift Bridge, named because of its shape rather than its function, as it carries a road over the canal. The basin was required once the Huddersfield Narrow Canal opened, as boats using either canal could not proceed along the other.<ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |pp=59\u201361}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=149\u2013150}}</ref>\n\n===Huddersfield Narrow Canal===\nThe Huddersfield Narrow Canal was the third of the trans-Pennine routes to open. It was authorised at the same time as the Rochdale Canal, but had a long tunnel on the summit level, and was not fully opened until 1811, seven years after the Rochdale. [[Standedge Tunnels|Standedge tunnel]] is the longest canal tunnel in Britain, and also the highest, as the summit level is {{convert|656|ft|m}} above sea level. This is higher than the summit of the Rochdale, and yet it is also the deepest canal tunnel, as it is {{convert|638|ft|m}} below Saddleworth Moor in places.<ref name=nic50>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |pp=50\u201358}}</ref><ref name=jane150>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=150\u2013152}}</ref>\n\nThe canal is {{convert|19.9|mi|km}} long, with 42 locks, numbered 1E to 42E up to the summit level, and another 32, numbered 32W to 1W on the descent to Dukinfield Junction.<ref name=jane150/> Near to Huddersfield there are two tunnels, constructed to take the reinstated canal under factories which were built after it closed in 1944. Bates Tunnel is {{convert|100|yd|m}} long, and Sellers Tunnel is {{convert|355|yd|m}} long.<ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |p=60}}</ref> As on the Rochdale, the locks are spread out rather than occurring in flights. Between the top lock and the north-east portal of Standedge Tunnel there is around {{convert|0.5|mi|km}} of level canal. Near the tunnel mouth is an information centre. There are four tunnels running through the hills at this point, as the canal tunnel is paralleled by three railway tunnels. Passage through the tunnel must be booked in advance, and is limited to a convoy of four boats in each direction on days when the tunnel is open.<ref name=jane150/>\n\nThe reconstruction of the canal has made big changes to places such as [[Stalybridge]], where the canal was culverted in 1947. Now the new canal threads through the streets, and it is appreciated for the vibrancy it has created. Below the final lock is another tunnel, {{convert|166|yd|m}} long, which carries the canal under an Asda supermarket to reach Dukinfield Junction.<ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |pp=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Ashton Canal===\nAt Dukinfield Junction, the [[Peak Forest Canal]] turns to the left, but the South Pennine Ring continues straight ahead onto the Ashton Canal. The first half is level, until Fairfield Junction is reached. This was the point at which the [[Hollinwood Canal]] turned off. A short section of it now leads to a new marina, opened in 2008, and there are plans to reopen more of it. Between locks 10 and 11 is a short stub which used to be part of the [[Stockport Canal]], for which there are also reopening plans. After descending through 18 locks and travelling {{convert|6.7|mi|km}}, the Ashton Canal arrives back at the starting point where it joins the Rochdale Canal at Ducie Street Junction.<ref>{{harvnb |Cumberlidge |2009 |pp=61\u201363}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb |Nicholson |2006 |pp=158\u2013161}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|United Kingdom|Transport}}\n*[[Canals of the United Kingdom]]\n*[[History of the British canal system]]\n*[[North Pennine Ring]]\n*[[Outer Pennine Ring]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book \n  |first=Jane |last=Cumberlidge \n  |title=Inland Waterways of Great Britain (8th Ed.)\n  |publisher=Imray Laurie Norie and Wilson \n  |year=2009 \n  |isbn=978-1-84623-010-3\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Nicholson\n  |authorlink=Nicholson Guides\n  |title=Nicholson Waterways Guide (Vol 5): North West and the Pennines\n  |publisher=Harper Collins\n  |year=2006\n  |isbn=0-00-721113-9\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite web\n  |url=http://www.jim-shead.com/waterways/Articles.php?wpage=91\n  |title=The Cheshire Ring\n  |first=Jim |last=Shead\n  |publisher=Waterways World\n  |date=March 2004\n  |issn=0309-1422\n  |ref=harv}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|2}}\n{{Canal Rings of the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[Category:Canals in England]]\n[[Category:Canals in West Yorkshire]]\n[[Category:Canal rings in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Pennines]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Pennine_Ring"}

It is now deserted, the last resident having left in 1938. Its history dates back to the [[12th century]]. The earliest form of its name was Petmeodhel (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated southwest of [[Abernyte]] in the centre of the parish of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]], Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe final resident, James Gillies Jr., the son of a [[stonemason]], left his home there for final time on 4 January, 1938.<ref name=courier/><ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and seperated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], wright Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor or Mure), Pirie (possibly Pierie), Martine and Lawson (possibly Lousone).

The earliest form of its name was Petmeodhel (''pet'' being a [[Pict]]ish word meaning ''piece of land'', while the origin of ''meodhel'' is unknown).<ref name=psns/>\n\n==Geography==\nLocated southwest of [[Abernyte]] in the centre of the parish of [[Kinnaird, Gowrie|Kinnaird]], Pitmiddle \"was once a thriving hilltop community and home to several hundred people\",<ref name=courier>''[[The Courier (Dundee)|The Courier]]'', 11 April 2020, pp. 22 & 23</ref> but its remote location eventually led to its [[abandoned village|abandonment]].<ref name=courier/> The hills referenced are the Braes of the Carse, which reach heights of around {{convert|180|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns>[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)</ref>\n\nThe location is on a slope overlooking the [[River Tay]], but sheltered from the south by Guardswell Hill and to the north by Pitmiddle Hill, which rises to over {{convert|275|m|ft}}.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==History==\nAlthough Pitmiddle was first called a [[toun]] in 1425,<ref name=psns/> the earliest reference to Pitmiddle is in a charter dating from 1172 to 1174. In it, [[William the Lion]] granted Ralph Rufus \"Kinnaird in its right divisions except ''Petmeodhel'' belonging to Richard my clerk\". This demonstrates that Pitmiddle and Kinnaird were originally [[royal land]]s. Pitmiddle belonged to the [[laird]] of [[Inchture|Inchmartine]]; Kinnaird to the laird of [[Fingask]]. Pitmiddle was held by the Inchmartines for around 150 years. The village itself was never a [[Barony (county division)|barony]], but was likely dealt with as a detached part of the barony of [[Longforgan]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nTenants paid ''cain'' and ''conveth''. Cain was originally a donation to a lord in recognition of his position. Conveth was a hospitality payment made to a lord on his annual visit to his estate. These were originally [[payment]] [[in kind]], in produce from the land.<ref name=psns/> Some tenants may have been [[free tenant|free]], but most were held in some degree of [[serfdom]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe Ogilvy family owned five-sixths of Inchmartine and Pitmiddle in the late [[15th century]].<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe village was not involved in the [[Jacobite risings]] of 1715 and 1745, but the neighbouring estate of Kinnaird was lost after 1715 due to its owner, Threipland of Fingask, being a supporter of the Jacobite movement.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAgricultural changes in the [[18th century]] affected the nature of the community, eventually leading to its abandonment.<ref name=psns/>\n\nAfter the [[Scottish Reformation]], Kinnaird became a separate parish.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe final resident, James Gillies Jr., the son of a [[stonemason]], left his home there for final time on 4 January, 1938.<ref name=courier/><ref name=psns/>\n\nToday, hidden amongst farmland and woods, the only remnants of the community are a few crumbling walls and the wild [[redcurrant]] and [[gooseberry]] bushes that once grew in the residents' gardens.<ref name=courier/>\n\n===Settlement and families===\nOn a 1783 map by James Stobie, Pitmiddle appeared as an irregularly shaped cluster of dwellings. The buildings would have been single-storied, made of [[wattle-and-daub]], roofed with turf or thatch. There would be a single room for living space, with one end cordoned-off for animals. An open hearth would have provided heat, possibly with a hole in the roof to extract smoke. Domestic rubbish would have been thrown onto a [[midden]] near the entrance. Attached to the hut was a yard where hens or pigs foraged and vegetables were grown. Enclosing the settlement was a ditch, beyond which was the arable land and seperated from it by the head [[dyke]] was the pasture.<ref name=psns/>\n\nThe main crops grown at Pitmeddle, per three [[17th century|17th-century]] rent rolls, were [[Bere (grain)|bere]] (a four-eared variety of barley) and oats. These also formed the basis of the peasants' diets. [[Wheat]] was later also grown.<ref name=psns/>\n\nPitmiddle is believe to have had a [[shieling]] on Blacklaw (Black Hill) to the north. By 1609, these had been turned into a sheep farm.<ref name=psns/>\n\nWilliam Thomassoun was living in Pitmiddle in the 15th century as a \"small but free tenant\". He had a son, Richard.<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the [[16th century]], Androu Benbie (possibly Benvie) was living as a [[wright]]. Edmund Jackson was fined ten [[shilling]]s for \"striking the common hird on the [[Sabbath]]\".<ref name=psns/>\n\nIn the 17th century, due to a greater survival in documentary evidence, more family names are known. These include: Anderson, Christal, Mores (possibly Morris or Moreis), Morton (possibly Mortoun), Millar, Blair, Mitchell, Whittet, Duncan, Paterson, Ogilvy, Young, Boug, Deucat (possibly Deugatt), Smyth, Christie, Robertson, Matthew, Thom, Gairdner (possibly Gardiner), Bowack (possibly Book, Boug or Boyok), Will, Hall, Muir (possibly Moor), Pirie (possibly Pierie) and Lawson (possibly Lousone). In 1650, there were 19 tenants.<ref name=psns/> \n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.psns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/PSNS-Pitmiddle-Village-and-Elcho-Nunnery-1988-complete-book.pdf \"Pitmiddle Village and Elcho Nunnery - Research and Excavation on Tayside\"] - Perthshire Society of Natural Science (1988)\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pitmiddle}}\n[[Category:Villages in Perth and Kinross]]\n[[Category:Former villages in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Seasider53", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitmiddle"}

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref>. Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming along with going shirtless when performing on-stage.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of [[Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology]], [[Bhubaneswar]], Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of [[Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad]], Distortion - Culfest of [[National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur]], Rocktaves - Oasis of [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani]],<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Searock of [[Waves (festival) ]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Goa Campus]], Till Deaf Do We Part of [[Pearl (cultural festival)]] at [[Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani \u2013 Hyderabad Campus]], Resonance of [[Festember]] at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]],<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=ATKT.in|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity of [[Antaragni]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur]], Decibelz of Xpressions at [[Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar]] and Thundermarch of Incandescene at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]].

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69. Also by the end of 2018 when the band was returning from Hornbill Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranchi bands Highway 69 and Vikrit in the finals|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/jharkhand/ranchi/news/ranchi-rock-band-highway-69-and-distorted-to-the-final-of-contest-035603-3389144.html|website=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref> in Nagaland they decided to give an end to participating in music competitions and work in their debut album and give preference to booked shows. With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nThe band went for recording their debut album in 2018-2019 but were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n id:studio value:black  legend:Studio_album\n\nLineData =\n layer:back\n color:studio\n at:03/21/2013\n at:03/21/2014\n at:03/21/2015\n at:03/21/2016\n at:03/21/2017\n at:03/21/2018\n at:03/21/2019\n at:03/21/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|website=Eastern Mirror Nagaland|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become an upcoming popular metal band from [[East India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Back then, Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] which is a city approximately 120 km from Ranchi. He was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial place where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians named Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. When Alvin and Tarang were forming a band and we're looking for band members, this is when Alvin suggested the names Binit and Dheeraj with whom he had already been performing. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and [[Thunderstrock Festival]] (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj and Alvin both use to be bandmates in their previous metal band. Both had high expectation from their band but weren't able to find that same spirit in that band so they left to form Highway 69. But even before completing one year as the drummer for Highway 69, Dheeraj decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first metropolitan show as a band which also required travelling of approximately 1,900 km from their hometown. The Bangalore show became the place where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest like [[Blackstratblues]], [[Karsh Kale]], [[Farhan Akhtar]] and many others. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting an inactive rock & metal music festival from their city called [[Thunderstrock Festival]]. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing this stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin and Dheeraj used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (John, the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nAfter a year since Dheeraj left the band, he again approached the band for joining it. He was considered in the band's line-up once again and eventually, Johnson had to leave who earlier came as the replacement in Dheeraj's place. With Dheeraj once again in the line-up, the band went for participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]], Ranchi, Thundermarch at [[National Institute of Technology, Silchar]] and Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad]]. The band won the competitions at [[NIFFT]] Ranchi and IIT (ISM) Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at [[NIT Silchar]] (Later in 2016, the band was again shortlisted for the finals at NIT Silchar but they couldn't go to perform and in 2018, they were selected for the third time and this time they even won the competition). The band also headlined the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 in 2015 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nLater in the year 2015, Dheeraj again decided to leave the band as he wasn't able to continue with regular practice and cope up with Highway 69's regular participating in events which required a lot of travelling throughout the country. So they finally decided on having a permanent drummer who will be committed towards the band. During this time, the band practised with various drummers from [[Ranchi]], [[Jamshedpur]] and even [[Kolkata]] but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who was in the line-up of [[Thunderstrock Festival]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|website=ET Chronicle|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Highway 69's vocalist. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals across India. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and even John agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement but tensions grew in mid-2017 when due to personal misunderstandings within the band, he was asked to leave the band. But later in the same year itself, he again joined the band and has been with the band ever since.

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain national recognization in the music scene and a good amount of fan following as well as positive reception and appreciation from fellow musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from [[Jamshedpur]] called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil, the band did a couple of shows with participation in the competition held at [[National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli]], [[Tamil Nadu]] and a music master class by Highway 69 at [[Chakradharpur]], [[Jharkhand]]. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by [[Bangalore Open Air]] alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing new original songs by the band. The band went unto compose their originals like Beyond Imagination, Don't be the Prisoners, Hope and Origin. Apart from taking part in competitions, they headlined in music festivals of [[Jamshedpur]], [[Ranchi]] and [[Kolkata]] which eventually helped them gain the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when Tarang started the work for that year's [[Thunderstrock Festival]], he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69. Also by the end of 2018 when the band was returning from Hornbill Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranchi bands Highway 69 and Vikrit in the finals|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/jharkhand/ranchi/news/ranchi-rock-band-highway-69-and-distorted-to-the-final-of-contest-035603-3389144.html|website=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref> in Nagaland they decided to give an end to participating in music competitions and work in their debut album and give preference to booked shows. With having a long-list of competitions that the band has won, they have been booked as the judges for the competitions in which they themselves once used to be the participants.

It is India's only dedicated Heavy metal open-air music festival which takes place yearly in [[Bangalore]] in collaboration with [[Wacken Open Air]]. The winning band gets an opportunity to play at Wacken Open Air in Germany which is one of the largest heavy metal festivals in the world. The band had earlier registered for the competition in 2017 but couldn't go to perform due to their bassist's unavailability. So they once again gave a try by participating in the competition in 2020 and were shortlisted for the Eastern India-leg of Wacken Metal Battle alongside other [[West Bengal]]-based bands. Highway 69 could not win the competition but the band shared the stage with some really great bands in the competition and witnessed the performance of headliners like [[Chronic Xorn]] and [[Kryptos]].\n\nThe band went for recording their debut album in 2018-2019 but were not impressed with the final recording, mixing and mastering done by the studio. This caused a huge loss for the band also in their album release dates. Currently, all the band members live in different places with Alvin in [[Ranchi]], Binit in [[Khelari]] and John in [[Khunti]] of [[Jharkhand]] state while Tarang lives in [[Angul]] of [[Odisha]] state of India. Despite living in different places, the band generally meets in weekdays for their band practice which requires all the members to take out time and travel to Ranchi (except Alvin who lives in Ranchi). Also with the loss suffered in their album recording, the band has cancelled the plan of recording its album and is currently recording three singles at music studios of [[Kolkata]]. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in India]], their recording dates have been postponed but the band has targeted to release these three singles along with its music videos in the year 2020 itself.\n\n==Band members==\n<!--Do not change the order of the members, as they are in order of instrument to reflect the timeline.-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Current members'''\n* Tarang Kerketta \u2013 vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Alvin Rozario]] \u2013 guitar, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* Binit Barla \u2013 bass, backing vocals <small>(2012\u2013present)</small>\n* John Raj Swami \u2013 drums <small>(2015\u2013present)</small>\n{{col-2}}\n\n'''Former members'''\n* Dheeraj Edward \u2013 drums <small>(2012\u20132013 & 2015)</small>\n* Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu \u2013 drums <small>(2014)</small>\n* Nikhil Dhanraj \u2013 drums <small>(2017)</small>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:90 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:10/01/2012 till:{{#time: m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:2013\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:2013\n\nColors =\n id:vocals value:red    legend:Vocals\n id:guitar value:green  legend:Guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue   legend:Bass,_backing_vocals\n id:drums  value:orange legend:Drums\n id:studio value:black  legend:Studio_album\n\nLineData =\n layer:back\n color:studio\n at:03/21/2013\n at:03/21/2014\n at:03/21/2015\n at:03/21/2016\n at:03/21/2017\n at:03/21/2018\n at:03/21/2019\n at:03/21/2020\n\nBarData =\n bar:Tarang  text:\"Tarang Kerketta\"\n bar:Alvin   text:\"Alvin Rozario\"\n bar:Binit   text:\"Binit Barla\"\n bar:Dheeraj text:\"Dheeraj Edward\"\n bar:Johnson text:\"A.

Although, as a consequence of all this - from the weight of vanguaradia transformed into the weight of history -, [the facility] is also one step away from being neutralized by this [our] society: a family condition and feared by the avant-garde movement in his last years.

In this particular case, Merike Talve's review of Morgan's Fugue in Parachute is appropriate, as is Roy Arden's Vanguard review of Ken Lum's Youth Portraits.  These are exemplary reviews in the terms of the typologies already described.  Talve uses almost a thousand words of description prior to maybe three hundred of discussion, while Arden's ration would be precisely the reverse.  Admittedly, Morgan's Fugue, involving two specific sites, one real-time and one reconstructed duration, and much administrative delay, calls for explanation in a big way, yet Talve settles into straight exposition, delaying any inflection of her description till the end.

Although, as a consequence of all this - from the weight of vanguaradia transformed into the weight of history -, [the facility] is also one step away from being neutralized by this [our] society: a family condition and feared by the avant-garde movement in his last years.

In this particular case, Merike Talve's review of Morgan's Fugue in Parachute is appropriate, as is Roy Arden's Vanguard review of Ken Lum's Youth Portraits.  These are exemplary reviews in the terms of the typologies already described.  Talve uses almost a thousand words of description prior to maybe three hundred of discussion, while Arden's ration would be precisely the reverse.  Admittedly, Morgan's Fugue, involving two specific sites, one real-time and one reconstructed duration, and much administrative delay, calls for explanation in a big way, yet Talve settles into straight exposition, delaying any inflection of her description till the end.
