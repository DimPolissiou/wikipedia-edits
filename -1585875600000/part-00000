{"title_page": "Translation of axes", "text_new": "{{Short description|Transformation of coordinates that moves the origin}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''translation of axes''' in two dimensions is a [[Map (mathematics)|mapping]] from an ''xy''-[[Cartesian coordinate system]] to an ''x'y<nowiki>'</nowiki>''-Cartesian coordinate system in which the ''x<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' axis is [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the ''x'' axis and ''k'' units away, and the ''y<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' axis is parallel to the ''y'' axis and ''h'' units away.  This means that the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] ''O<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' of the new coordinate system has coordinates (''h'', ''k'') in the original system.  The positive ''x<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' and ''y<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' directions are taken to be the same as the positive ''x'' and ''y'' directions.  A point ''P'' has coordinates (''x'', ''y'') with respect to the original system and coordinates (''x<nowiki>'</nowiki>'', ''y<nowiki>'</nowiki>'') with respect to the new system, where\n\n:<math> </math>\n{{NumBlk|::|<math> x = x' + h </math> {{spaces|4}} and {{spaces|4}} <math> y = y' + k </math>|{{EquationRef|1}}}}\n\nor equivalently\n\n{{NumBlk|::|<math> x' = x - h </math> {{spaces|4}} and {{spaces|4}} <math> y' = y - k .</math><ref>{{harvtxt|Anton|1987|p=107}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|p=315}}</ref>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nIn the new coordinate system, the point ''P'' will appear to have been translated in the opposite direction.  For example, if the ''xy''-system is translated a distance ''h'' to the right and a distance ''k'' upward, then ''P'' will appear to have been translated a distance ''h'' to the left and a distance ''k'' downward in the ''x'y<nowiki>'</nowiki>''-system .  A translation of axes in more than two dimensions is defined similarly.<ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|pp=585\u2013588}}</ref>   A translation of axes is a [[rigid transformation]], but not a [[linear map]].  (See [[Affine transformation]].)\n\n== Motivation ==\nCoordinate systems are essential for studying the equations of [[curve (geometry)|curve]]s using the methods of [[analytic geometry]].  To use the method of coordinate geometry, the axes are placed at a convenient position with respect to the curve under consideration.  For example, to study the equations of [[ellipse]]s and [[hyperbola]]s, the [[focus (geometry)|foci]] are usually located on one of the axes and are situated symmetrically with respect to the origin.  If the curve (hyperbola, [[parabola]], ellipse, etc.) is ''not'' situated conveniently with respect to the axes, the coordinate system should be changed to place the curve at a convenient and familiar location and orientation.  The process of making this change is called a [[Coordinate system#Transformations|transformation of coordinates]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Protter|Morrey|1970|pp=314\u2013315}}</ref>\n\nThe solutions to many problems can be simplified by translating the coordinate axes to obtain new axes parallel to the original ones.<ref>{{harvtxt|Anton|1987|p=107}}</ref>\n\n== Translation of conic sections ==\n{{Main|Conic section}}\nThrough a change of coordinates, the equation of a conic section can be put into a [[Conic section#Standard forms in Cartesian coordinates|standard form]], which is usually easier to work with.

The conclusion of the proof still holds in the general case, provided each occurrence of {{math|exp}} is correctly interpreted.

Any {{math|''C''<sup>''k''</sup>, 0 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 \u221e, ''\u03c9''}} map {{math|''f''}} between vector spaces (here first considering matrix Lie groups) has a {{math|''C''<sup>''k''</sup>}} inverse such that {{math|''f''}} is a {{math|''C''<sup>''k''</sup>}} bijection in an open set around a point {{math|''x''}} in the domain provided {{math|''df''<sub>''x''</sub>}} is invertible. From {{EquationNote|(3)}} it follows that this will happen precisely when\n\n:<math>\\frac{1 - e^{\\mathrm{ad_X}}}{\\mathrm{ad}_X}</math>\n\nis invertible. This, in turn, happens when the eigenvalues of this operator are all nonzero. The eigenvalues of {{math|{{sfrac|1 \u2212 exp(\u2212ad<sub>''X''</sub>)|ad<sub>''X''</sub>}}}} are related to those of {{math|ad<sub>''X''</sub>}} as follows. If {{math|''g''}} is an analytic function of a complex variable expressed in a power series such that {{math|''g''(''U'')}} for a matrix {{math|''U''}} converges, then the eigenvalues of {{math|''g''(''U'')}} will be {{math|''g''(''\u03bb''<sub>''ij''</sub>)}}, where {{math|''\u03bb''<sub>''ij''</sub>}} are the eigenvalues of {{math|''U''}}, the double subscript is made clear below.<ref group=nb>This is seen by choosing a basis for the underlying vector space such that {{math|''U''}} is [[triangular matrix|triangular]], the eigenvalues being the diagonal elements.

Then \n:<math>Xe_i = \\lambda_ie_i + \\cdots,</math>\nwith the remaining terms multiples of {{math|''e''<sub>''n''</sub>}} with {{math|''n'' > ''i''}}.

It possesses important potteries. Large herds of cattle are reared on the communal lands, which are productive also of wheat, rapeseed and maize. Several well-attended fairs are held here annually.\n\n==Location==\nMez\u0151t\u00far lies in the centre of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], on the banks of the [[Hortob\u00e1gy-Beretty\u00f3]], near the Budapest\u2013[[Szolnok]]\u2013[[B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba]] railway line.\n\n==History==\n[[File:1900 Mez\u00f6-Tur 4filler Yv40.jpg|thumb|left|100px|In the Kingdom of Hungary in 1900]]\nThe town was founded in the [[Middle Ages]] and it was called ''T\u00far'' after the river Beretty\u00f3, which was formerly named T\u00far. Later it was named Mez\u0151t\u00far (''mez\u0151'' means field, referring to the good soil of the Great Plain.) The town was first mentioned under King [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] (1205\u20131235) as ''villa Tur''. The shortest road between [[Buda]] and [[Transylvania]] led through Mez\u0151t\u00far, which was the only town in the area having a ferry. Because of this advantage the town prospered and King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] made it a market town. In the 15th century it held famous markets, and its importance grew.\n\nMez\u0151t\u00far was a royal estate until 1378, later it had various owners, and under King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias]] the town was divided into two parts because it was granted to two different people.\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman occupation of Hungary]], Mez\u0151t\u00far fell under Ottoman rule in 1562 and was freed in 1692. After the expelling of the Ottomans and during the revolution led by [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|Prince R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] the citizens had to leave the town twice (1692\u20131699 and 1705\u20131710).\n\nIn the 18th century the town began to prosper again, mainly as an agricultural town.\n\nAfter the Ottoman occupation until 1918, Mez\u0151t\u00far was part of the [[Austrian monarchy]], province of Hungary;<ref>Handbook of Austria and Lombardy-Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850-1864, by Edwin MUELLER, 1961.</ref> (in [[Transleithania]] after the [[compromise of 1867]]) in the  [[Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nFollowing World War One and the [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918\u201320)|instability in Hungary]], it became a part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungarian Kingdom]]. During World War Two, Mez\u0151t\u00far was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] before being fought over by the [[Red Army|Soviets]], who captured Mez\u0151t\u00far in late 1944. The city was damaged; the railway bridge over the Hortob\u00e1gy-Beretty\u00f3 river was destroyed, requiring the current one to be built after the war.{{Citation needed|reason=Written based off of what my grandmother told me; proper sources would be appreciated|date=June 2017}} A monument was erected near the city hall to commemorate the fighting during the war.\n\nStarting in the 16th century and going throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Mezotur produced pottery.

It possesses important potteries. Large herds of cattle are reared on the communal lands, which are productive also of wheat, rapeseed and maize. Several well-attended fairs are held here annually.\n\n==Location==\nMez\u0151t\u00far lies in the centre of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]], on the banks of the [[Hortob\u00e1gy-Beretty\u00f3]], near the Budapest\u2013[[Szolnok]]\u2013[[B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba]] railway line.\n\n==History==\n[[File:1900 Mez\u00f6-Tur 4filler Yv40.jpg|thumb|left|100px|In the Kingdom of Hungary in 1900]]\nThe town was founded in the [[Middle Ages]] and it was called ''T\u00far'' after the river Beretty\u00f3, which was formerly named T\u00far. Later it was named Mez\u0151t\u00far (''mez\u0151'' means field, referring to the good soil of the Great Plain.) The town was first mentioned under King [[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]] (1205\u20131235) as ''villa Tur''. The shortest road between [[Buda]] and [[Transylvania]] led through Mez\u0151t\u00far, which was the only town in the area having a ferry. Because of this advantage the town prospered and King [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] made it a market town. In the 15th century it held famous markets, and its importance grew.\n\nMez\u0151t\u00far was a royal estate until 1378, later it had various owners, and under King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias]] the town was divided into two parts because it was granted to two different people.\n\nDuring the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman occupation of Hungary]], Mez\u0151t\u00far fell under Ottoman rule in 1562 and was freed in 1692. After the expelling of the Ottomans and during the revolution led by [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|Prince R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] the citizens had to leave the town twice (1692\u20131699 and 1705\u20131710).\n\nIn the 18th century the town began to prosper again, mainly as an agricultural town.\n\nAfter the Ottoman occupation until 1918, Mez\u0151t\u00far was part of the [[Austrian monarchy]], province of Hungary;<ref>Handbook of Austria and Lombardy-Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850-1864, by Edwin MUELLER, 1961.</ref> (in [[Transleithania]] after the [[compromise of 1867]]) in the  [[Kingdom of Hungary]].\n\nFollowing World War One and the [[Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918\u201320)|instability in Hungary]], it became a part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Hungarian Kingdom]]. During World War Two, Mez\u0151t\u00far was occupied by the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] before being fought over by the [[Red Army|Soviets]], who captured Mez\u0151t\u00far in late 1944. The city was damaged; the railway bridge over the Hortob\u00e1gy-Beretty\u00f3 river was destroyed, requiring the current one to be built after the war.{{Citation needed|reason=Written based off of what my grandmother told me; proper sources would be appreciated|date=June 2017}} A monument was erected near the city hall to commemorate the fighting during the war.\n\nStarting in the 16th century and going throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, Mezotur produced pottery. The pottery industry slowed down in the 1950s, but still is a cultural landmark.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etnofolk.eu/en/article/pottery-tradition-mezotur|title=The Pottery Tradition of Mez\u0151t\u00far - Etnofolk|author=|date=|website=www.etnofolk.eu|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum.hu/exhibition/11790/History_of_pottery_in_Mezotur|title=Exhibition - History of pottery in Mez\u0151t\u00far - Museum.hu|author=|date=|website=www.museum.hu|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe post-office was opened in 1853.\n<!-- to be continued... -->\n\n==Travel==\nMez\u0151t\u00far is a large railroad hub, serviced by [[Hungarian State Railways|M\u00c1V]].
