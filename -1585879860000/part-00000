{"title_page": "Siget in der Wart", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n'''Siget in der Wart''' or '''\u0150risziget''' ({{Lang-de|Siget in der Wart}}; {{Lang-hu|\u0150risziget}}) is a small village in [[Burgenland]], [[Austria]], in the district of [[Oberwart]] (Hun: ''Fels\u0151\u0151r''). The village lies on the banks of the Zicken Bach (''Sz\u00e9k-patak'') and administratively belongs to the neighbouring town of [[Rotenturm an der Pinka]] (Hun: ''Vasv\u00f6r\u00f6sv\u00e1r''). According to the 2001 census it had a population of 274. They are almost exclusively ethnic Hungarians. Siget/\u0150risziget is part of the [[Upper \u0150rs\u00e9g]] or Wart microregion together with Oberwart (Hun: ''Fels\u0151\u0151r'') and [[Unterwart]] (Hun: ''Als\u00f3\u0151r'').\n\n==History==\nThe village was established in the early Middle Ages in the borderzone of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (''gyep\u0171''). It was first mentioned in historical documents in 1352 under the name ''Zygeth'' ('sziget' means island in Hungarian). The population was made up of Hungarian frontier guards (''\u0151r''), probably related to the [[Sz\u00e9kelys]] of Transylvania. The guards constituted a free, privileged community. \u0150risziget belonged to the old [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)|county]] of [[Vas]] until 1921.\n\nIn the 14th century the rights of the villagers were confirmed and they were ranked among the nobles. Sziget was placed under the protection of the town of [[K\u0151szeg]] (G\u00fcns) until 1441. Although later the guards lost their military significance, the noble ''\u0151r''s kept their privileges. They were confirmed again in the early 17th century by [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|King M\u00e1ty\u00e1s II of Hungary]]. Most of the village people converted to Lutheran faith in the Age of Reformation. In the end of the 19th century \u0150risziget was famous for its knife-makers (their products were called ''\u0151ri bicska'').\n\nAccording to the last Hungarian census in 1910 \u0150risziget had a population of 333 people (exclusively Hungarians). The village was given to Austria according to the [[Treaty of Trianon]] in 1921. In the second half of the 20th century the population decreased. In 1991 only 272 people lived in Siget (82 percent ethnic Hungarians). The village remained a small, secluded agricultural community until the end of the 20th century. It was merged with Rotenturm an der Pinka (Formerly Vasv\u00f6r\u00f6sv\u00e1r) in 1971.\n\n==Sights==\n*'''Church of St. Ladislaus'''\nThe Roman Catholic Church named after King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] (Hun: ''Szent L\u00e1szl\u00f3'') was built in the 13th century in [[Roman architecture|Roman]] style. It was first mentioned in 1368. Later it was enlarged in the 16th century. In 1979 restoration revealed 16th century nonfigurative frescoes from the Age of Reformation. There is a wooden ceiling and gallery, and a stone pulpit (probably medieval). The 18th-century altar is decorated with a painting of ''Patrona Hungariae''. The Virgin Mary is portrayed in old Hungarian attire.\n\n*'''Lutheran Church'''\nIt was built in 1792\u201394 in late [[Baroque]] style. The bell tower is a later addition from 1820. There is a Hungarian inscription above the door: \"''Er\u0151s v\u00e1r n\u00e9k\u00fcnk az Isten''\" ([[A Mighty Fortress Is Our God]]). The typical Lutheran altar-pulpit was made around 1800 for the Lutheran Church of [[Stadtschlaining]] (''V\u00e1rosszal\u00f3nak'') but it was brought to \u0150risziget twenty years later. The altar painting is a copy of [[Peter Paul Rubens]]: ''Golgotha''.\n\n*'''Lutheran Rectory'''\nThe Old Rectory (No. 53) behind the church was built in the second half of the 18th century. It is an interesting example of the local folk-architecture with an arched porch. The charter of the village given by King M\u00e1ty\u00e1s II of Hungary is kept in the Rectory. The '''Old School''' from the 19th century was converted to a bilingual Magyar-German kindergarten.\n\n*'''Old peasant houses'''\nA lot of old peasant houses survived in the village, all typical examples of the folk-architecture of the [[Upper \u0150rs\u00e9g|Fels\u0151-\u0150rs\u00e9g]] in the 19th century. No.78 and 82. are particularly nice with arched porches.\n\n{{Cities and communes in Oberwart}}\n\n{{Coord|47|16|N|16|17|E|region:AT_type:city|display=title}}\n\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Siget In Der Wart}}\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Oberwart District]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=December 2009}}\n'''Siget in der Wart''' or '''\u0150risziget''' ({{Lang-de|Siget in der Wart}}; {{Lang-hu|\u0150risziget}}) is a small village in [[Burgenland]], [[Austria]], in the district of [[Oberwart]] (Hun: ''Fels\u0151\u0151r'').

He married Auguste Adler in 1897 with whom he had two daughters; the electrical engineer and inventor [[Reinhold Rudenberg]] was his son-in-law.\n\nMinkowski died suddenly of [[appendicitis]] in G\u00f6ttingen on 12 January 1909. [[David Hilbert]]'s obituary of Minkowski illustrates the deep friendship between the two mathematicians (translated):\n:Since my student years Minkowski was my best, most dependable friend who supported me with all the depth and loyalty that was so characteristic of him.  Our science, which we loved above all else, brought us together; it seemed to us a garden full of flowers.  In it, we enjoyed looking for hidden pathways and discovered many a new perspective that appealed to our sense of beauty, and when one of us showed it to the other and we marveled over it together, our joy was complete.  He was for me a rare gift from heaven and I must be grateful to have possessed that gift for so long.  Now death has suddenly torn him from our midst.  However, what death cannot take away is his noble image in our hearts and the knowledge that his spirit continues to be active in us.\n\n[[Max Born]] delivered the obituary on behalf of the mathematics students at G\u00f6ttingen.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=42\u201343}}\n\nThe main-belt [[asteroid]] [[12493 Minkowski]] and [[M-matrix|M-matrices]] are named in Minkowski's honor.<ref name=\"springer\" />\n\n==Education and career==\n[[File:Hermann Minkowski.png|thumb|upright|Minkowski in 1883, at the time of being awarded the Mathematics Prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]]]\nMinkowski was educated in [[East Prussia]] at the ''Albertina'' [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]], where he earned his doctorate in 1885 under the direction of [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]]. In 1883, while still a student at K\u00f6nigsberg, he was awarded the Mathematics Prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] for his manuscript on the theory of [[quadratic form]]s. He also became a friend of another renowned mathematician, [[David Hilbert]]. His brother, [[Oskar Minkowski]] (1858\u20131931), was a well-known physician and researcher.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMinkowski taught at the universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg|K\u00f6nigsberg]], [[University of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]], and [[University of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]]. At the [[Federal Polytechnic Institute|''Eidgen\u00f6ssische Polytechnikum'']], today the [[ETH Zurich]], he was one of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s teachers.\n\nMinkowski explored the arithmetic of [[quadratic form]]s, especially concerning ''n'' variables, and his research into that topic led him to consider certain geometric properties in a space of ''n'' [[dimension]]s. In 1896, he presented his ''[[geometry of numbers]]'', a geometrical method that solved problems in [[number theory]]. He is also the creator of the [[Minkowski Sausage]] and the [[Minkowski cover]] of a curve.<ref>[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=minkowski+sausage&a=*C.minkowski+sausage-_*MathWorld-&f2=3&f=MinkowskiSausage.n%5Cu005f3 \"Minkowski Sausage\"], ''[[WolframAlpha]]''</ref><!-- Additional citation needed.

[[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]] was one of his students there.\n\n==Work on relativity==\n{{Further|Minkowski space|Minkowski diagram}}\n\nBy 1908 Minkowski realized that the [[special theory of relativity]], introduced by his former student [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905 and based on the previous work of [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincar\u00e9|Poincar\u00e9]], could best be understood in a four-dimensional space, since known as the \"[[Minkowski spacetime]]\", in which [[time]] and [[space]] are not separated entities but intermingled in a four-dimensional [[space\u2013time]], and in which the [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz geometry]] of special relativity can be effectively represented using the invariant interval <math>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - c^2 t^2</math> (see [[History of special relativity]]).\n\nThe mathematical basis of Minkowski space can also be found in the [[hyperboloid model]] of [[hyperbolic space]] already known in the 19th century, because isometries (or motions) in hyperbolic space can be related to [[Lorentz transformations]], which included contributions of [[Wilhelm Killing]] (1880, 1885), [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1881), [[Homersham Cox (mathematician)|Homersham Cox]] (1881), [[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1894) and others (see [[History of Lorentz transformations]]).\n\nThe beginning part of his address called \"Space and Time\" delivered at the 80th Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians (21 September 1908) is now famous:\n\n<blockquote>The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.</blockquote>\n\n==Publications==\n;Relativity\n* {{Cite journal\n|doi=10.1002/andp.19153521505\n|author=Minkowski, Hermann\n|origyear=1907|year=1915\n|title=Das Relativit\u00e4tsprinzip\n|journal=Annalen der Physik\n|volume=352\n|issue=15\n|pages=927\u2013938|bibcode = 1915AnP...352..927M |title-link=s:de:Das Relativit\u00e4tsprinzip (Minkowski)\n}}\n* {{Cite journal\n|author=Minkowski, Hermann\n|year=1908\n|title=Die Grundgleichungen f\u00fcr die elektromagnetischen Vorg\u00e4nge in bewegten K\u00f6rpern\n|journal=Nachrichten der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse\n|pages=53\u2013111|title-link=s:de:Die Grundgleichungen f\u00fcr die elektromagnetischen Vorg\u00e4nge in bewegten K\u00f6rpern\n}}\n** English translation: \"[[s:Translation:The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies|The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies]]\".

He married Auguste Adler in 1897 with whom he had two daughters; the electrical engineer and inventor [[Reinhold Rudenberg]] was his son-in-law.\n\nMinkowski died suddenly of [[appendicitis]] in G\u00f6ttingen on 12 January 1909. [[David Hilbert]]'s obituary of Minkowski illustrates the deep friendship between the two mathematicians (translated):\n:Since my student years Minkowski was my best, most dependable friend who supported me with all the depth and loyalty that was so characteristic of him.  Our science, which we loved above all else, brought us together; it seemed to us a garden full of flowers.  In it, we enjoyed looking for hidden pathways and discovered many a new perspective that appealed to our sense of beauty, and when one of us showed it to the other and we marveled over it together, our joy was complete.  He was for me a rare gift from heaven and I must be grateful to have possessed that gift for so long.  Now death has suddenly torn him from our midst.  However, what death cannot take away is his noble image in our hearts and the knowledge that his spirit continues to be active in us.\n\n[[Max Born]] delivered the obituary on behalf of the mathematics students at G\u00f6ttingen.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=42\u201343}}\n\nThe main-belt [[asteroid]] [[12493 Minkowski]] and [[M-matrix|M-matrices]] are named in Minkowski's honor.<ref name=\"springer\" />\n\n==Education and career==\n[[File:Hermann Minkowski.png|thumb|upright|Minkowski in 1883, at the time of being awarded the Mathematics Prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]]]\nMinkowski was educated in [[East Prussia]] at the ''Albertina'' [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg]], where he earned his doctorate in 1885 under the direction of [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]]. In 1883, while still a student at K\u00f6nigsberg, he was awarded the Mathematics Prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] for his manuscript on the theory of [[quadratic form]]s. He also became a friend of another renowned mathematician, [[David Hilbert]]. His brother, [[Oskar Minkowski]] (1858\u20131931), was a well-known physician and researcher.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nMinkowski taught at the universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of K\u00f6nigsberg|K\u00f6nigsberg]], [[University of Z\u00fcrich|Z\u00fcrich]], and [[University of G\u00f6ttingen|G\u00f6ttingen]]. At the [[Federal Polytechnic Institute|''Eidgen\u00f6ssische Polytechnikum'']], today the [[ETH Zurich]], he was one of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s teachers.\n\nMinkowski explored the arithmetic of [[quadratic form]]s, especially concerning ''n'' variables, and his research into that topic led him to consider certain geometric properties in a space of ''n'' [[dimension]]s. In 1896, he presented his ''[[geometry of numbers]]'', a geometrical method that solved problems in [[number theory]]. He is also the creator of the Minkowski Sausage and the Minkowski cover of a curve.<ref>[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=minkowski+sausage&a=*C.minkowski+sausage-_*MathWorld-&f2=3&f=MinkowskiSausage.n%5Cu005f3 \"Minkowski Sausage\"], ''[[WolframAlpha]]''</ref><!-- Additional citation needed.

[[Constantin Carath\u00e9odory]] was one of his students there.\n\n==Work on relativity==\n{{Further|Minkowski space|Minkowski diagram}}\n\nBy 1908 Minkowski realized that the [[special theory of relativity]], introduced by his former student [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905 and based on the previous work of [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincar\u00e9|Poincar\u00e9]], could best be understood in a four-dimensional space, since known as the \"[[Minkowski spacetime]]\", in which [[time]] and [[space]] are not separated entities but intermingled in a four-dimensional [[space\u2013time]], and in which the [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz geometry]] of special relativity can be effectively represented using the invariant interval <math>x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - c^2 t^2</math> (see [[History of special relativity]]).\n\nThe mathematical basis of Minkowski space can also be found in the [[hyperboloid model]] of [[hyperbolic space]] already known in the 19th century, because isometries (or motions) in hyperbolic space can be related to [[Lorentz transformations]], which included contributions of [[Wilhelm Killing]] (1880, 1885), [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1881), [[Homersham Cox (mathematician)|Homersham Cox]] (1881), [[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1894) and others (see [[History of Lorentz transformations]]).\n\nThe beginning part of his address called \"Space and Time\" delivered at the 80th Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians (21 September 1908) is now famous:\n\n<blockquote>The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.</blockquote>\n\n==Publications==\n;Relativity\n* {{Cite journal\n|doi=10.1002/andp.19153521505\n|author=Minkowski, Hermann\n|origyear=1907|year=1915\n|title=Das Relativit\u00e4tsprinzip\n|journal=Annalen der Physik\n|volume=352\n|issue=15\n|pages=927\u2013938|bibcode = 1915AnP...352..927M |title-link=s:de:Das Relativit\u00e4tsprinzip (Minkowski)\n}}\n* {{Cite journal\n|author=Minkowski, Hermann\n|year=1908\n|title=Die Grundgleichungen f\u00fcr die elektromagnetischen Vorg\u00e4nge in bewegten K\u00f6rpern\n|journal=Nachrichten der Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zu G\u00f6ttingen, Mathematisch-Physikalische Klasse\n|pages=53\u2013111|title-link=s:de:Die Grundgleichungen f\u00fcr die elektromagnetischen Vorg\u00e4nge in bewegten K\u00f6rpern\n}}\n** English translation: \"[[s:Translation:The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies|The Fundamental Equations for Electromagnetic Processes in Moving Bodies]]\".

The Jewish slaves at the Siegendorf Camp were enslaved in a local gold mine.\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=left\n|1869|1585\n|1880|1589\n|1890|1591\n|1900|1886\n|1910|1938\n|1923|2077\n|1934|2363\n|1939|2247\n|1951|2387\n|1961|2400\n|1971|2454\n|1981|2402\n|1991|2446\n|2001|2720\n|2011|2902\n}}\n{{clear left}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Cities and towns in Eisenstadt-Umgebung}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Eisenstadt-Umgebung District]]\n[[Category:Nazi concentration camps in Austria]]\n[[Category:Jewish Austrian history]]\n[[Category:Jewish Hungarian history]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Austria]]\n\n\n{{Burgenland-geo-stub}}\n{{Hungary-hist-stub}}\n{{Austria-hist-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siegendorf"}

Do not add any unnecessary details to plot. -->\nDominick \"Dom\" Cobb and Arthur are \"extractors\": they perform [[corporate espionage]] using experimental military technology to infiltrate the [[Unconscious mind|subconscious]] of their targets and extract valuable information through a [[shared dreaming|shared]] [[Dream world (plot device)|dream world]]. Their latest target, Japanese businessman Saito, reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly impossible job: implanting an idea in a person's subconscious, or \"inception\". To break up the [[energy industry|energy]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer's son and heir, Robert, to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence once the job is done to clear Cobb's apparent criminal status, which prevents him from returning home to his children.\n\nThough Arthur believes the task is impossible, Cobb insists that it can be done. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts a powerful [[sedative]] for a stable \"[[false awakening|dream within a dream]]\" strategy; and Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing the [[labyrinth]] of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb's father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles. While dream-sharing with Cobb, Ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal.\n\nAfter Maurice dies in [[Sydney]], Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles. The team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses this as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream. At each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"[[Hypnic jerk|kick]]\" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be successful, these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated due to the nature of time, which flows much faster in each successive level. They use \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" as an auditory cue to help coordinate the kicks. The first level is Yusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. \n\nThe team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by armed projections from his subconscious, which has been specifically trained to defend against such intruders. The team takes Robert and a wounded Saito to a warehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into \"[[Limbo#Cultural references|limbo]]\": a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult, if not impossible, and in which a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream. Despite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.\n\nEames impersonates Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Robert reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives them around in a van as the rest are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that he has been kidnapped by Browning, and that Cobb is his subconscious protector. Cobb persuades Robert to go down another level to explore Browning's subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter Robert's subconscious). The third level is a fortified hospital on a snowy mountain dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Saito takes Robert into the equivalent of his subconscious. Yusuf, under pursuit by Robert's projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge, thus initiating his kick too soon. This causes an avalanche in Eames' level, and removes the gravity of Arthur's level, thus forcing Arthur to improvise a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mal's projection emerges in Eames' level and kills Robert; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Robert and Saito, while Eames sets up a kick by rigging the hospital with explosives.\n\nCobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. Sedated for five hours of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream constructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object that dreamers use to distinguish their dreams from reality), and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real. However, after waking up, the inception had taken root and Mal still believed that she was dreaming. In an attempt to \"wake up\" for real, she committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of his father-in-law.\n\nThrough his confession, Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Robert up with a kick. Revived at the fortified hospital, he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake on the plane and Saito makes a phone call.\n\nUpon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home. Using Mal's old totem\u2014a [[spinning top]] that spins indefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality\u2014Cobb conducts a test to prove that he is indeed in the real world, but he does not observe its result and instead joins his children in the garden.\n<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY DETAIL ABOUT THE ENDING HERE.

N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for 'limbo,' with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape.\n\nThe final phase of principal photography took place in [[Alberta]] in late November 2009.

Nolan did not shoot any footage with [[IMAX]] cameras as he had with ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. \"We didn't feel that we were going to be able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film given that it deals with a potentially surreal area, the nature of dreams and so forth, I wanted it to be as realistic as possible.

Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan expressed his ideal vision: \"Something glacial, with clear modernist architecture, but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs\".<ref name=\"trussell\" /> Franklin and his team ended up with \"something that looked like an iceberg version of [[Gotham City]] with water running through it.\"<ref name=\"trussell\" /> They created a basic model of a glacier and then designers created a program that added elements like roads, intersections and ravines until they had a complex, yet organic-looking, cityscape. For the Paris-folding sequence, Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then they created rough computer animations to give them an idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion. Later during principal photography, Nolan was able to direct Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page based on this rough computer animation that Franklin had created. ''Inception'' had nearly 500 visual effects shots (in comparison, ''[[Batman Begins]]'' had approximately 620), which is relatively few in comparison to contemporary effects-heavy films, which can have as many as 2,000 visual effects shots.<ref name=\"trussell\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Inception: Music from the Motion Picture}}\n\nThe score for ''Inception'' was written by [[Hans Zimmer]],<ref name=\"CinemaRewind\" /> who described his work as \"a very electronic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/inception-score-hans-zimmers-mikee-65200 |title=Hans Zimmer's 'Inception' Score Will Release On July 13th |publisher=ScreenRant.com |access-date=July 1, 2010 |date=June 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625130549/http://screenrant.com/inception-score-hans-zimmers-mikee-65200/ |archivedate=June 25, 2010}}</ref> dense score\",<ref name=\"Cassidy\"/> filled with \"nostalgia and sadness\" to match Cobb's feelings throughout the film.<ref name=\"Martens\"/> The music was written simultaneously to filming,<ref name=\"Cassidy\">{{cite news |last=Cassidy |first=Kevin |title=Q&A: Composer Hans Zimmer |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 13, 2010 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/qampa-composer-hans-zimmer-25455|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref> and features a guitar sound reminiscent of [[Ennio Morricone]], played by [[Johnny Marr]], former guitarist of [[The Smiths]].\n[[\u00c9dith Piaf]]'s \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" (\"No, I Regret Nothing\") appears throughout the film, used to accurately time the dreams, and Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score.<ref name=\"Martens\">{{cite news |last=Martens |first=Todd |title=Hans Zimmer and Johnny Marr talk about the sad romance of 'Inception' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 20, 2010 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/inception-christopher-nolan-the-smiths-johnny-marr-hans-zimmer-and-johnny-marr-on-the-sound-of-inception-its-about-sadness.html |access-date=July 20, 2010}}</ref>\n[[Inception: Music from the Motion Picture|A soundtrack album]] was released on July 11, 2010 by [[Reprise Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inceptionscore.com/|title=Inception: Music from the Motion Picture official website|publisher=Warner Bros.|access-date=July 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616131408/http://www.inceptionscore.com/|archive-date=June 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The majority of the score was also included in high resolution [[5.1 surround sound]] on the second disc of the 2 disc Blu-ray release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Inception-Blu-ray/14492/#Review|title=Inception Blu-ray review from Blu-ray.com|access-date=August 8, 2012}}</ref> Hans Zimmer's music was nominated for an Academy Award in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] category in 2011, losing to [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Atticus Ross]] of ''[[The Social Network]]''.<ref name=oscars/>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Reality and dreams===\n[[File:Impossible staircase.svg|right|thumb|[[Penrose stairs]] are incorporated into the film as an example of the [[impossible object]]s that can be created in [[lucid dream]] worlds.|alt=A staircase in a square format.

However, \"he did get many aspects right,\" she said, citing the scene in which a sleeping Cobb is shoved into a full bath, and in the dream world water gushes into the windows of the building, waking him up. \"That's very much how real stimuli get incorporated, and you very often wake up right after that intrusion\".<ref name=\"Breznican\">{{Cite news|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|title=With ''Inception'', Chris Nolan's head games continue|work=[[USA Today]]|date=July 15, 2010|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2010-07-15-inception15_CV_N.htm|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\nNolan himself said, \"I tried to work that idea of manipulation and management of a [[Lucid dream|conscious dream]] being a skill that these people have. Really the script is based on those common, very basic experiences and concepts, and where can those take you? And the only outlandish idea that the film presents, really, is the existence of a technology that allows you to enter and share the same dream as someone else.\"<ref name=\"Boucher\" />\n\n=== Dreams and cinema ===\nOthers have argued that the film is itself a [[oneiric (film theory)|metaphor for filmmaking]], and that the filmgoing experience itself, images flashing before one's eyes in a darkened room, is akin to a dream. Writing in ''Wired'', Jonah Lehrer supported this interpretation and presented neurological evidence that brain activity is strikingly similar during film-watching and sleeping. In both, the [[visual cortex]] is highly active and the [[prefrontal cortex]], which deals with logic, deliberate analysis, and self-awareness, is quiet.<ref name='Lehrer'>[[Jonah Lehrer|Lehrer, J.]] [https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/07/the-neuroscience-of-inception/ The Neuroscience of Inception], ''Wired'', July 26, 2010. Retrieved October 8, 2011.</ref> Paul argued that the experience of going to a picturehouse is itself an exercise in shared dreaming, particularly when viewing ''Inception'': the film's sharp cutting between scenes forces the viewer to create larger narrative arcs to stitch the pieces together. This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, on the part of the audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious.<ref name='Paul'/> At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding [[Infinity mirror|facing mirrors]] underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in ''la Croix'' asked \"Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?\"<ref>Dreyfus, St\u00e9phanie [http://www.la-croix.com/Culture-Loisirs/Culture/Actualite/Inception-allegorie-onirique-sur-l-illusion-cinematographique-_NG_-2010-07-20-554535 \"Inception\", all\u00e9gorie onirique sur l'illusion cin\u00e9matographique] ''[[La Croix]]'', July 20, 2010.

As the film's main antagonist, she is a frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor.<ref name=\"threecircle\" /> Nolan described Mal as \"the essence of the femme fatale\",<ref name=\"Production Notes 2010, p. 9\">{{cite web|url=http://wwws.warnerbros.co.uk/inception/mainsite/pdf/INCEPTION_PK_Notes__Bios_6-18.pdf|title=Production Notes 2010, p. 9|publisher=}}</ref> the key ''noir'' reference in the film. As a \"classic femme fatale\" her relationship with Cobb is in his mind, a manifestation of Cobb's own neurosis and fear of how little he knows about the woman he loves.<ref name=\"wired-jan11\"/> DiCaprio praised Cotillard's performance saying that \"she can be strong and vulnerable and hopeful and heartbreaking all in the same moment, which was perfect for all the contradictions of her character\".<ref name=pn10/>\n\nNolan began with the structure of a heist movie, since [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] is an essential element of that genre, though adapted it to have a greater emotional narrative suited to the world of dreams and subconscious.<ref name=\"wired-jan11\"/> Or, as Denby surmised, \"the outer shell of the story is an elaborate caper\".<ref name=\"Denby\"/> [[Kristin Thompson]] argued that exposition was a major formal device in the film. While a traditional heist movie has a heavy dose of exposition at the beginning as the team assembles and the leader explains the plan, in ''Inception'' this becomes nearly continuous as the group progresses through the various levels of dreaming.<ref name='Bordwell2'>[http://www.davidbordwell.net/blog/2010/08/12/revisiting-inception/ Revisiting INCEPTION] www.davidbordwell.net, August 12, 2010.

In this way, exposition takes precedence over characterization. The characters' relationships are created by their respective skills and roles.

Do not add any unnecessary details to plot. -->\nDominick \"Dom\" Cobb and Arthur are \"extractors\": they perform [[corporate espionage]] using experimental military technology to infiltrate the [[Unconscious mind|subconscious]] of their targets and extract valuable information through a [[shared dreaming|shared]] [[Dream world (plot device)|dream world]]. Their latest target, Japanese businessman Saito, reveals that he arranged their mission himself to test Cobb for a seemingly impossible job: implanting an idea in a person's subconscious, or \"inception\". To break up the [[energy industry|energy]] [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] of ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, Saito wants Cobb to convince Fischer's son and heir, Robert, to dissolve his father's company. In return, Saito promises to use his influence once the job is done to clear Cobb's apparent criminal status, which prevents him from returning home to his children.\n\nThough Arthur believes the task is impossible, Cobb insists that it can be done. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts a powerful [[sedative]] for a stable \"[[false awakening|dream within a dream]]\" strategy; and Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing the [[labyrinth]] of the dream landscapes, recruited with the help of Cobb's father-in-law, Professor Stephen Miles. While dream-sharing with Cobb, Ariadne learns his subconscious houses an invasive projection of his late wife Mal.\n\nAfter Maurice dies in [[Sydney]], Robert Fischer accompanies the body on a ten-hour flight back to Los Angeles. The team (including Saito, who wants to verify their success) uses this as an opportunity to sedate and take Fischer into a shared dream. At each dream level, the person generating the dream stays behind to set up a \"[[Hypnic jerk|kick]]\" that will be used to awaken the other sleeping team members from the deeper dream level; to be successful, these kicks must occur simultaneously at each dream level, a fact complicated due to the nature of time, which flows much faster in each successive level. They use \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" as an auditory cue to help coordinate the kicks. The first level is Yusuf's dream of a rainy Los Angeles. \n\nThe team abducts Fischer, but they are attacked by armed projections from his subconscious, which has been specifically trained to defend against such intruders. The team takes Robert and a wounded Saito to a warehouse, where Cobb reveals that while dying in the dream would normally wake Saito up, the powerful sedatives needed to stabilize the multi-level dream will instead send a dying dreamer into \"[[Limbo#Cultural references|limbo]]\": a world of infinite subconscious from which escape is extremely difficult, if not impossible, and in which a dreamer risks forgetting they are in a dream. Despite these setbacks, the team continues with the mission.\n\nEames impersonates Robert's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Robert reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives them around in a van as the rest are sedated into the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur. Cobb persuades Robert that he has been kidnapped by Browning, and that Cobb is his subconscious protector. Cobb persuades Robert to go down another level to explore Browning's subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter Robert's subconscious). The third level is a fortified hospital on a snowy mountain dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Saito takes Robert into the equivalent of his subconscious. Yusuf, under pursuit by Robert's projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge, thus initiating his kick too soon. This causes an avalanche in Eames' level, and removes the gravity of Arthur's level, thus forcing Arthur to improvise a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mal's projection emerges in Eames' level and kills Robert; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Robert and Saito, while Eames sets up a kick by rigging the hospital with explosives.\n\nCobb reveals to Ariadne that he and Mal went to limbo while experimenting with the dream-sharing technology. Sedated for five hours of real time, they spent fifty years in a dream constructing a world from their shared memories. When Mal refused to return to reality, Cobb used a rudimentary form of inception by reactivating her totem (an object that dreamers use to distinguish their dreams from reality), and reminding her subconscious that their world was not real. However, after waking up, the inception had taken root and Mal still believed that she was dreaming. In an attempt to \"wake up\" for real, she committed suicide and framed Cobb for her death to force him to do the same. Facing a murder charge, Cobb fled the U.S., leaving his children in the care of his father-in-law.\n\nThrough his confession, Cobb makes peace with his guilt over Mal's death. Ariadne kills Mal's projection and wakes Robert up with a kick. Revived at the fortified hospital, he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: a projection of his dying father telling him to be his own man. While Cobb remains in limbo to search for Saito, the other team members ride the synchronized kicks back to reality. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito in limbo and reminds him of their agreement. The dreamers all awake on the plane and Saito makes a phone call.\n\nUpon arrival at Los Angeles Airport, Cobb passes the U.S. immigration checkpoint and Professor Miles accompanies him to his home. Using Mal's old totem\u2014a [[spinning top]] that spins indefinitely in a dream world but falls over in reality\u2014Cobb conducts a test to prove that he is indeed in the real world, but he does not observe its result and instead joins his children in the garden.\n<!-- DO NOT ADD ANY DETAIL ABOUT THE ENDING HERE.

The idea was inspired by a technique used in [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968). Nolan said, \"I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario\".<ref name=\"Heuring2\">Heuring, July 2010, p. 32.</ref> The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40&nbsp;ft (12&nbsp;m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length was increased to 100&nbsp;ft (30&nbsp;m).

High-pressure [[nitrogen]] was used to create the effect of a series of explosions. Pfister used six high-speed cameras to capture the sequence from different angles and make sure that they got the shot. The visual effects department enhanced the sequence, adding more destruction and flying debris.

The dining room was inspired by the historic [[Nijo Castle]], built around 1603.

The filmmakers set up elaborate effects (e.g., rooftop [[water cannon]]s) to give the audience the impression that the weather was overcast and soggy.

Capturing the actors suspended within the van in slow motion took a whole day to film. \n\nOnce the van landed in the water, the challenge for the actors was to avoid panic. \"And when they ask you to act, it's a bit of an ask,\" explained Cillian Murphy.<ref name=\"Ditzian\" /> The actors had to be underwater for four to five minutes while drawing air from [[Diving cylinder|scuba tanks]]; underwater [[buddy breathing]] is shown in this sequence.<ref name=\"Ditzian\" /> \n\nCobb's house was in Pasadena. The hotel lobby was filmed at the CAA building in Century City. 'Limbo' was made on location in Los Angeles and [[Morocco]], with the beach scene filmed at [[Palos Verdes]] beach with CGI buildings. N Hope St. in Los Angeles was the primary filming location for 'limbo,' with green screen and CGI being used to create the dream landscape.\n\nThe final phase of principal photography took place in [[Alberta]] in late November 2009.

Nolan did not shoot any footage with [[IMAX]] cameras as he had with ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]''. \"We didn't feel that we were going to be able to shoot in IMAX because of the size of the cameras because this film given that it deals with a potentially surreal area, the nature of dreams and so forth, I wanted it to be as realistic as possible. Not be bound by the scale of those IMAX cameras, even though I love the format dearly\".<ref name=\"Weintraub\" /> In addition Nolan and Pfister tested using [[Showscan]] and [[List of film formats|Super Dimension 70]] as potential large format [[high frame rate]] camera systems to use for the film, but ultimately decided against either format.<ref name=\"Heuring\" /> Sequences in slow motion were filmed on a Photo-Sonics 35mm camera at speeds of up to 1000 frames per second. Wally Pfister tested shooting some of these sequences using a high speed [[Digital cinematography|digital camera]], but found the format to be too unreliable due to technical glitches. \"Out of six times that we shot on the digital format, we only had one useable piece and it didn't end up in the film.

Franklin had artists build concepts while Nolan expressed his ideal vision: \"Something glacial, with clear modernist architecture, but with chunks of it breaking off into the sea like icebergs\".<ref name=\"trussell\" /> Franklin and his team ended up with \"something that looked like an iceberg version of [[Gotham City]] with water running through it.\"<ref name=\"trussell\" /> They created a basic model of a glacier and then designers created a program that added elements like roads, intersections and ravines until they had a complex, yet organic-looking, cityscape. For the Paris-folding sequence, Franklin had artists producing concept sketches and then they created rough computer animations to give them an idea of what the sequence looked like while in motion. Later during principal photography, Nolan was able to direct Leonardo DiCaprio and Ellen Page based on this rough computer animation that Franklin had created. ''Inception'' had nearly 500 visual effects shots (in comparison, ''[[Batman Begins]]'' had approximately 620), which is relatively few in comparison to contemporary effects-heavy films, which can have as many as 2,000 visual effects shots.<ref name=\"trussell\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Inception: Music from the Motion Picture}}\n\nThe score for ''Inception'' was written by [[Hans Zimmer]],<ref name=\"CinemaRewind\" /> who described his work as \"a very electronic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/inception-score-hans-zimmers-mikee-65200 |title=Hans Zimmer's 'Inception' Score Will Release On July 13th |publisher=ScreenRant.com |access-date=July 1, 2010 |date=June 18, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625130549/http://screenrant.com/inception-score-hans-zimmers-mikee-65200/ |archivedate=June 25, 2010}}</ref> dense score\",<ref name=\"Cassidy\"/> filled with \"nostalgia and sadness\" to match Cobb's feelings throughout the film.<ref name=\"Martens\"/> The music was written simultaneously to filming,<ref name=\"Cassidy\">{{cite news |last=Cassidy |first=Kevin |title=Q&A: Composer Hans Zimmer |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=July 13, 2010 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/qampa-composer-hans-zimmer-25455|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}</ref> and features a guitar sound reminiscent of [[Ennio Morricone]], played by [[Johnny Marr]], former guitarist of [[The Smiths]].\n[[\u00c9dith Piaf]]'s \"[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]\" (\"No, I Regret Nothing\") appears throughout the film, used to accurately time the dreams, and Zimmer reworked pieces of the song into cues of the score.<ref name=\"Martens\">{{cite news |last=Martens |first=Todd |title=Hans Zimmer and Johnny Marr talk about the sad romance of 'Inception' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 20, 2010 |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2010/07/inception-christopher-nolan-the-smiths-johnny-marr-hans-zimmer-and-johnny-marr-on-the-sound-of-inception-its-about-sadness.html |access-date=July 20, 2010}}</ref>\n[[Inception: Music from the Motion Picture|A soundtrack album]] was released on July 11, 2010 by [[Reprise Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inceptionscore.com/|title=Inception: Music from the Motion Picture official website|publisher=Warner Bros.|access-date=July 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616131408/http://www.inceptionscore.com/|archive-date=June 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The majority of the score was also included in high resolution [[5.1 surround sound]] on the second disc of the 2 disc Blu-ray release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/Inception-Blu-ray/14492/#Review|title=Inception Blu-ray review from Blu-ray.com|access-date=August 8, 2012}}</ref> Hans Zimmer's music was nominated for an Academy Award in the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] category in 2011, losing to [[Trent Reznor]] and [[Atticus Ross]] of ''[[The Social Network]]''.<ref name=oscars/>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===Reality and dreams===\n[[File:Impossible staircase.svg|right|thumb|[[Penrose stairs]] are incorporated into the film as an example of the [[impossible object]]s that can be created in [[lucid dream]] worlds.|alt=A staircase in a square format.

This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, on the part of the audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious.<ref name='Paul'/> At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding [[Infinity mirror|facing mirrors]] underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in ''la Croix'' asked \"Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?\"<ref>Dreyfus, St\u00e9phanie [http://www.la-croix.com/Culture-Loisirs/Culture/Actualite/Inception-allegorie-onirique-sur-l-illusion-cinematographique-_NG_-2010-07-20-554535 \"Inception\", all\u00e9gorie onirique sur l'illusion cin\u00e9matographique] ''[[La Croix]]'', July 20, 2010.

As the film's main antagonist, she is a frequent, malevolent presence in his dreams. Dom is unable to control these projections of her, challenging his abilities as an extractor.<ref name=\"threecircle\" /> Nolan described Mal as \"the essence of the femme fatale\",<ref name=\"Production Notes 2010, p. 9\">{{cite web|url=http://wwws.warnerbros.co.uk/inception/mainsite/pdf/INCEPTION_PK_Notes__Bios_6-18.pdf|title=Production Notes 2010, p. 9|publisher=}}</ref> the key ''noir'' reference in the film.

In this way, exposition takes precedence over characterization. The characters' relationships are created by their respective skills and roles.
