He remained active with Dark New Day while playing with [[Evanescence]].<ref name=\"bm72791\" /> Hunt performed with Evanescence in their 2009 one-off show at the Maquinaria Festival in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\nOn February 2010, Hunt rejoined [[Evanescence]] when the band started pre-production of their third album. After touring in 2011 and 2012, Evanescence decided to take an extended break before returning to the stage in 2016 and beginning work on a new studio album. ''[[Synthesis (Evanescence album)|Synthesis]]'' was released in 2017 and Hunt embarked on tour with the band throughout 2018, including a joint tour with violinist [[Lindsey Stirling]].\n\n===Black Label Society===\nHunt was a member of Black Label Society from 2010 to 2011, recording [[Order of the Black]] with the band. In 2011, he left due to his commitment to Evanescence.\n\n===Device===\nIt was announced in January 2013 that Hunt would be a band member for [[David Draiman]]'s new project, [[Device (heavy metal band)|Device]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Childers|first=Chad|title=David Draiman\u2019s Device Secure Geezer Butler, Serj Tankian, M.

His real passion, however, was music, as he had been dreaming of becoming a singer since early childhood; as a teenager, Ortega was an admirer of [[Elvis Presley]].\n\nOrtega moved to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1956, where he sold coffee in the city's parks, corners, and streets.  He used his work as a coffee seller to get into show business by setting up a coffee-selling spot near Buenos Aires' [[TV P\u00fablica Digital (Argentina)|Channel Seven]] Public Television station.  This worked well for Ortega, as many entertainers would stop by to buy coffee from his stand, and he became acquainted with some of the best known [[Argentine rock]] musicians of the era. Ortega also worked near [[Radio Belgrano]], where many of the singers he met while selling coffee near the television station would recognise him and form a bond with the young star in the making.\n\nOrtega became friends with members of a famous group called \"Carlinhos y su Banda\".  He learned to play drums during band practice sessions, eventually joining the group. A period of wild success across South America followed for the band, with Ortega being one of their most popular members.  Ortega left the group to follow a solo career, confident that the recognition the group had given him would guarantee him success as a solo artist.\n\n=== Career in entertainment ===\n[[File:Palito Ortega.JPG|thumb|Ortega performing in 1970]]\nHis first solo album, ''La Edad del Amor'' (\"The Age of Love\"), was recorded under the artistic name of Nery Nelson.  This album, as well as the next one (''Yo no Quiero'', translated to \"I Don't Want To\"), were not hits.  Both albums were recorded in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] with low budgets and no recording company to back them up.  Ortega also used the artistic nickname of Tony Varano for some of his live shows at the time, and he became a member of \"The Lyons\" when the Argentine rock legend, lead singer [[Peter Rock (musician)|Peter Rock]], left the band.  His interests, however, remained in being a successful solo singer, and he left The Lyons within months of joining that band.\n\nOrtega met songwriter Dino Ramos in 1962; this would prove important in Ortega's career as Ramos would write a large number of Ortega's hits.  By 1963, in the midst of Argentina's own \"new wave\" (''La nueva ola'') movement (similar to those in the United States and many other countries), Ortega began to become a television regular, as he was featured multiple times on a popular [[Telefe|Canal 11]] show of the time, ''Club del Clan'' (\"The Clan Club\") along with [[Cachita Gal\u00e1n]]; the word clan in Spanish has nothing to do with [[Racism|racist]] groups; \"clan\" has the same meaning as \"group\" in Spanish.\n\nIn 1963, he signed with [[RCA Records]], and began recording immediately. His television appearances led to a career in [[Cinema of Argentina|cinema]].  Ortega recorded 27 albums, and starred in 26 films at the time, becoming a teen idol as a consequence.  He acted and sang in those films, and shared the big screen with many of Argentina's most important actors and actresses of the time. His fame acquainted him with Evangelina Salazar, a television actress known for her role as a country schoolteacher; the couple were married in 1967, and had six children.<ref name=noticias>''Revista Noticias''. September 12, 1991.</ref>\n\nPalito Ortega would travel extensively through the rest of the 1960s and the 1970s.  He went on to record for RCA in [[Mexico]], Italy, England, and [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In 1966 while in Nashville Palito Ortega recorded the hit song \"[[Sombras]]\" by music composer and visual artist [[Gil Veda]].{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Ortega's status as a teen idol declined during that period, and he reduced his television and movie appearances, as well as his album recordings.  He did, however, become a successful music promoter, and in August 1981, produced a show for [[Frank Sinatra]] in Argentina. The sharp [[devaluation]] of the [[Peso ley|peso]] following the collapse of Economy Minister [[Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz]]'s exchange rate timetable made his US dollar-denominated contractual obligations unaffordable, however. Ortega reportedly lost one million dollars after paying the legendary crooner for his [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires|Luna Park Stadium]] show, and was forced to sell a significant portion of his estate.<ref name=noticias/>\n\nOrtega relocated with his wife and six children to Miami in 1985, which by then was becoming a mecca for Latino entertainers. Ortega joined the likes of [[Iris Chac\u00f3n]], [[Charyt\u00edn]], [[Celia Cruz]], [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Julio Iglesias]] and others as a resident of the south Florida city. Ortega sang the [[United States national anthem]] before the 1986 world middleweight championship [[boxing]] fight between [[Marvin Hagler]] and [[John Mugabi]].\n\n=== Politics and retirement ===\n[[File:Palito Ortega.jpg|thumb|Ortega performing at a musical revival in 2009]]\nOrtega retired from show business for a while after that, focusing on his career as a businessman and eyeing a career as a con politician instead.  Two of his children (son Emanuel and daughter Julieta) followed in their father's footsteps as entertainers, and, with Emanuel moving to Mexico, Ortega decided to return to Argentina.  He was elected Governor of [[Tucum\u00e1n Province]] in 1991, narrowly defeating former military Governor [[Antonio Domingo Bussi]]. One of his brothers, Juan, supported Bussi, though another brother, Luis, was elected Mayor of [[Malvinas Argentinas Partido|General Sarmiento]] (a suburb of Buenos Aires).<ref name=noticias/>\n\nOrtega governed as a close ally of President [[Carlos Menem]]. Aligned with Menem's free market policies, he privatized the Bank of Tucum\u00e1n and the Provincial Water Authority, moves which cost him approval. The Vice-Governor, Julio D\u00edaz, broke with Ortega, and in 1993 accused the governor of ordering politically motivated investigations of students and labor union officials;<ref>[http://www.fcen.uba.ar/prensa/micro/1993/ms114.htm ''Microsemanario''. Number 114. July 19, 1993. {{in lang|es}}]</ref> Ortega declined to run for re-election in 1995, and was instead elected to the [[Argentine Senate]]. The [[Justicialist Party]] nominated him for the Vice-Presidency in 1999, but his party lost the [[1999 Argentine general election|general elections]] that year.\n\nOrtega left politics, and in 2002, began to tour as a singer again.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ortega, Palito}}\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Tucum\u00e1n Province]]\n[[Category:Argentine people of Spanish descent]]\n[[Category:Argentine Roman Catholics]]\n[[Category:Argentine musicians]]\n[[Category:Argentine male singers]]\n[[Category:Argentine male film actors]]\n[[Category:Ortega family|Palito]]\n[[Category:Governors of Tucum\u00e1n Province]]\n[[Category:Justicialist Party politicians]]\n[[Category:Latin Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winners]]\n[[Category:Argentine record producers]]\n[[Category:Latin music record producers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{BLP sources|date=June 2010}}\n\n{{Infobox governor\n|name= Ram\u00f3n \"Palito\" Ortega\n|image=\n|imagesize=210px\n|order=<nowiki/>\n|office= Argentine Senate\n|term_start=December 10, 1995\n|term_end=December 10, 1999\n|office2= Governor of Tucum\u00e1n\n|term_start2= October 28, 1991\n|term_end2= October 28, 1995\n|lieutenant2= Julio D\u00edaz Lozano\n|predecessor2= Julio C\u00e9sar Ar\u00e1oz\n|successor2= [[Antonio Domingo Bussi]]\n|birth_date= {{birth date and age|1941|3|8|}}\n|birth_place= [[Lules]], [[Tucum\u00e1n]]\n|death_date=\n|spouse=Evangelina Salazar\n|profession= Musician\n|party= [[Justicialist Party]]\n}}\n\n'''Ram\u00f3n Bautista Ortega''' ({{IPA-es|ra\u02c8mon bau\u02c8tista o\u027e\u02c8te\u0263a}}; born March 8, 1941<ref>{{Cite book|title=Soy lo que soy: Mujeres y hombres que rompieron el molde|author=Sandra Mihanovich|publisher=Penguin Random House Grupo Editorial Argentina|date=2014|isbn=9789500750431}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmtv.com.ar/biografia/show.php?bnid=1935|work=CMTV Biographica|title=Palito Ortega}}</ref>) is an Argentinian singer and actor, better known as '''Palito Ortega'''<ref name=\"Hall\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YCkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA24&dq=%22Palito+Ortega%22&hl=en&ei=52cVTLmoDcP48AbU1qyGCg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=3&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=%22Palito%20Ortega%22&f=false|title=Ortega: The Rage of Argentina|last=Hall|first=Claude|date=August 21, 1965|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|page=24|accessdate=June 13, 2010}}</ref> ({{IPA-es|pa\u02c8lito o\u027e\u02c8te\u0263a|pron}}).
