The population was 82,922 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Tracy is located inside a geographic triangle formed by [[Interstate 205 (California)|Interstate 205]] on the north side of the city, [[Interstate 5]] to the east, and [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]] to the southwest; this has given rise to Tracy's motto, now recorded on the city's website: \"Think Inside the Triangle\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ci.tracy.ca.us/?navid=12 | title=City of Tracy: About Us | accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1760s, the area that is now the city of Tracy was populated by the [[Yokuts]] tribe of Native Americans. Their lives revolved around subsistence from foods provided by the local rivers and creeks. The Yokuts were forced out by Spanish and later Mexican and American immigrants and ravaged by diseases.<ref>[http://tracymuseum.org/tracy-history/ Tracy History] tracymuseum.org</ref>\n\nThe origins of Tracy are related to the mid-19th century construction of [[Central Pacific Railroad]] lines running from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] through [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Tracy is part of the [[San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area]], an extension of the [[Bay Area]]. A number of small communities sprang up along these lines, including the one named for railroad director [[Lathrop J. Tracy]]. Incorporated in 1911, Tracy grew rapidly and prospered as an agricultural area even when railroad operations began to decline in the 1950s. Beginning in the 1980s, Tracy experienced a growth spurt as people migrated to the city looking for affordable alternatives to Bay Area home prices, in addition to a more tranquil lifestyle. A steady period of growth ensued, as many companies found Tracy an ideal location for their distribution facilities.\n\nIn December 1969, the town of Tracy was the host of the [[Altamont Free Concert]], held at the (now closed) [[Altamont Raceway Park]].  An estimated 300,000 people appeared at the speedway infield in an event that was plagued by violence, but featured the Rolling Stones, Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:IMAG3043-tracy.jpg|thumb|left|333px|Tracy, California in 2016. Note large warehouses at east side of the city.]]\n[[File:Tracy vineyard.jpeg|thumb|left|333x333px|Tracy vineyard]]\n\nLocated in the Greater Bay Area, Tracy sits near both fertile and (due to a region of hills west of Tracy) infertile agricultural lands. Tracy has a Mediterranean climate. \nSome of this land (in the east and mostly north of Tracy because of the moist Delta river system) has come under increasing development pressure as the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]'s vigorous population growth has spilled over into the Tracy area as well as other locations such as the new town of [[Mountain House, San Joaquin County, California|Mountain House]] (because of Tracy's Measure A in 1990) near the Bay Area's edge.\n\nIn an effort to reduce its impact on the environment, the city launched the Emerald Tracy Project in September 2009. City spokesman Matt Robinson said that if it succeeds, Tracy will be the second city after Riverside to satisfy the state's goal for sustainable communities.\n\n===Tire fire, South of Tracy===\n\nOn August 7, 1998, a [[tire fire]] ignited at S.F. Royster's Tire Disposal south of Tracy on South MacArthur Drive, near Linne Rd. The tire dump held over 7 million illegally stored tires and was allowed to burn for over two years before it was extinguished. Allowing the fire to burn was considered to be a better way to avoid groundwater contamination than putting it out.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z9o0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=LSEGAAAAIBAJ&pg=6405,5839950&dq=tracy+tire+fire&hl=en Rubber Threat: Tracy tire fire highlights old problem.] ''Lodi News-Sentinel''.

The population was 82,922 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Tracy is located inside a geographic triangle formed by [[Interstate 205 (California)|Interstate 205]] on the north side of the city, [[Interstate 5]] to the east, and [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]] to the southwest; this has given rise to Tracy's motto, now recorded on the city's website: \"Think Inside the Triangle\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ci.tracy.ca.us/?navid=12 | title=City of Tracy: About Us | accessdate=11 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1760s, the area that is now the city of Tracy was populated by the [[Yokuts]] tribe of Native Americans. Their lives revolved around subsistence from foods provided by the local rivers and creeks. The Yokuts were forced out by Spanish and later Mexican and American immigrants and ravaged by diseases.<ref>[http://tracymuseum.org/tracy-history/ Tracy History] tracymuseum.org</ref>\n\nThe origins of Tracy are related to the mid-19th century construction of [[Central Pacific Railroad]] lines running from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] through [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Tracy is part of the [[San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, CA Combined Statistical Area]], an extension of the [[Bay Area]]. A number of small communities sprang up along these lines, including the one named for railroad director [[Lathrop J. Tracy]]. Incorporated in 1911, Tracy grew rapidly and prospered as an agricultural area even when railroad operations began to decline in the 1950s. Beginning in the 1980s, Tracy experienced a growth spurt as people migrated to the city looking for affordable alternatives to Bay Area home prices, in addition to a more tranquil lifestyle. A steady period of growth ensued, as many companies found Tracy an ideal location for their distribution facilities.\n\nIn December 1969, the town of Tracy was the host of the [[Altamont Free Concert]], held at the (now closed) [[Altamont Raceway Park]].  An estimated 300,000 people appeared at the speedway infield in an event that was plagued by violence, but featured the Rolling Stones, Santana, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:IMAG3043-tracy.jpg|thumb|left|333px|Tracy, California in 2016. Note large warehouses at east side of the city.]]\n[[File:Tracy vineyard.jpeg|thumb|left|333x333px|Tracy vineyard]]\n\nLocated in the Greater Bay Area, Tracy sits near both fertile and (due to a region of hills west of Tracy) infertile agricultural lands. Tracy has a Mediterranean climate. \nSome of this land (in the east and mostly north of Tracy because of the moist Delta river system) has come under increasing development pressure as the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]'s vigorous population growth has spilled over into the Tracy area as well as other locations such as the new town of [[Mountain House, San Joaquin County, California|Mountain House]] (because of Tracy's Measure A in 1990) near the Bay Area's edge.\n\nIn an effort to reduce its impact on the environment, the city launched the Emerald Tracy Project in September 2009. City spokesman Matt Robinson said that if it succeeds, Tracy will be the second city after Riverside to satisfy the state's goal for sustainable communities.\n\n===Tire fire, South of Tracy===\n\nOn August 7, 1998, a [[tire fire]] ignited at S.F.

Several of these initiatives were led by Razaleigh. These initiatives were major corporate takeovers of foreign conglomerates and major industries which was previously owned by foreign shareholders respectively.\n\nDue to his excellent drive and contribution to the country's economy, and his strong economics and finance background, he was entrusted to manage the country's finance and was made the Finance Minister in 1976, Chairman of [[Asian Development Bank]] in 1976, IBRD ([[World Bank]]) and [[IMF]] in 1977, and [[Islamic Development Bank]] in 1978.\n\n===New Straits Times Press===\n\nThe [[New Straits Times Press]] (initially News Straits Times Press Sdn Bhd) was formed by the Directors of the Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, to acquire a majority shareholding in the company which was the largest mass-circulation news organ in the territories of East and West Malaysia.\n\nThe Malaysia operations of the Straits Times, the Sunday Times, the [[Malay Mail]], the Sunday Mail, [[Berita Harian]] and Berita Minggu were transferred to this new company. An agreement was reached in 1972 between the directors of the ''Straits Times group'' and ''Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah'' for the disposal of 80 per cent of the stock of the News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. for the Malaysian interest.<ref>The Straits Times 17 September 1972 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n===Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad===\n\nOn 4 June 1965, ''\"Kongres Ekonomi Bumiputra\"'' (Bumiputra Economic Congress), sponsored by the Ministry of National and Rural Development, were held in Kuala Lumpur for 3 days to generate an interest among Malays and other local indigenous groups to participate in commerce and industry. Seven working committees were formed to achieve these objectives.<ref>The Straits Times 5 May 1965 page 18, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n[[Tun Abdul Razak]], the then Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia announced that the Government had agreed to form a local Bank (\"Bank Bumiputra\") as recommended by the Economic Congress based on a majority of the 69 resolutions passed in the meeting.<ref>The Straits Times 8 May 1965 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> The Bank, with its initial capital to be provided by the Malaysian Government, would be established. The Bank's ownership would ultimately be sold to the public through shares. On 15 July 1965, Tun Abdul Razak announced the Government agreed to provide RM5 million as the initial capital for Bank Bumiputra.<ref>The Straits Times 15 July 1965 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> In an event presenting certificate to 80 students at \"Taman Latehan Wanita\", Lornie Road, Tun Abdul Razak reiterated that the main aim of the bank was to assist rural businessmen in the form of loans irrespective of religion.<ref>The Straits Times 4 September 1965 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\nBank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad was formally launched by Tun Abdul Razak on 1 October 1965 with authorised capital of RM25 million, instead of RM5 million announced earlier.<ref>The Straits Times 1 October 1965 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> The senior management was headed by Mohd Raslan bin Dato' Abdullah (managing director), former Accountant General of Government and Tengku Razaleigh (Executive Director). The other board members are S.O.K. Ubaidulla (President of United Chamber of Commerce), L.E Osman (a lawyer), K. Mushir Ariff (an incorporated valuer), Wan Yahya bin Haji Mohamad (a businessman from Terengganu), K.D. Eu (a company director, and Kuok Hock Nien (a company director). The general manager of the Bank was Wong Aun Pui, a prominent local banker with 20 years of experience and director of many rubber and palm oil companies.<ref>The Straits Times 10 March 1966 page 10, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n=== Perbadanan Nasional Berhad (PERNAS) ===\n\nPERNAS (Perbadanan Nasional Berhad or National Corporation) was set up in November 1969 as a wholly owned government company to carry out the resolutions at the Second Bumiputera Economic Congress. Among the major shareholders included were Malaysia's Ministry of Finance, [[Bank Negara Malaysia]] (The Central Bank of Malaysia) and Bank Bumiputera Malaysia Berhad. Pernas was put under a solid footing under the chairmanship of Razaleigh (1970\u20131974) who had been the Minister of Finance from 1976 to 1984.<ref>The Developing Economies, Malaysia's Localization Policy and its impact of British owned Enterprises, Page 372, [[Institute of Developing Economies]], Japan</ref>\n\nWith the background of poor and very low participation of [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputeras]] in the private sector and industries at that time, PERNAS' principle were to:\n* enter undertakings which would bring high economic returns,\n* when enter into joint ventures, PERNAS was to be the majority stockholder with controlling interest over operations,\n* Bumiputeras were to be employed at all levels of operations and undertakings.<ref>The Developing Economies, Malaysia's Localization Policy and its impact of British owned Enterprises, Page 374, [[Institute of Developing Economies]], Japan</ref>\n\n8 subsidiaries were set up under PERNAS to achieve its objective. Malaysia National Insurance Berhad (MNI) was established in April 1970. There followed during 1971 Pernas Construction Sdn. Bhd., Pernas Engineering Sdn. Bhd., and Pernas Securities Sdn. Bhd. Then came Pernas Mining Sdn. Bhd (1973) and Pernas Edar Sdn Bhd (1974).\n\nRazaleigh was in the thick of what became known as the Haw Par imbroglio of the mid-1970s, working with the Singapore-based Haw Par Brothers International Ltd, then an offshoot of the empire of British wheeler-dealer Jim Slater, to acquire control of London Tin Company, the British-controlled tin conglomerate, and the [[Sime Darby]] plantations conglomerate.<ref>The Straits Times 2 January 1976 page 5, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> This was to be achieved through a complex series of transactions by which PERNAS would end up as the largest shareholder of both. It failed when Singapore accused Haw Par of financial irregularities and later jailed a senior executive and the head, Donald Watson, fled to Ireland.\n\nBut it proved a short-lived setback for Razaleigh. Within two years, a share and proxy battle orchestrated by merchant bank Rothschild \u2013 which was also a part owner of Bumiputera Merchant Bankers \u2013 brought Sime Darby under Malaysian control and its headquarters shifted to Kuala Lumpur. Control of London Tin Company was acquired the same year. In another coup in 1979, Malaysian money made a \"dawn raid\" on British plantation giant, Kumpulan Guthrie Bhd, which wrenched the company from British control; most of the other British owned plantations soon followed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1113&Itemid=31|title=A Onetime Political Star Returns to Malaysia's Stage|date= 24 March 2008|publisher=asiasentinel.com}}</ref>\n\nAmong the major corporate takeover exercise and formation of new businesses during Razaleigh's stewardship as Pernas chairman were\n* Insurance \u2013 [[Malaysia National Insurance]] Bhd,\n* Banking \u2013 [[Maybank]] Bhd,\n* Mining \u2013 the then-largest tin mining company in the world, London Tin Company, which was later renamed [[MMC Corporation Berhad]].\n* Palm Oil and Rubber Producer \u2013 [[Sime Darby]], [[Guthrie (company)|Guthrie]] Berhad, [[Highlands & Lowlands Berhad]].\n\n====Malaysia's first trade delegation to China====\n\n[[File:TRH_Pernas_Meeting_China.jpg|left|thumb|Tengku Razaleigh: Pernas Meeting with Chinese Delegation.

Total trade with China stood at a mere RM105.6 million in 1971, but ballooned to RM1.6 billion in 1980. Since then the contact between the two countries has been on the increase as evidenced by the number of visits of trade, medical and sports delegations to China.\n\n=== Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)===\n\nOn 6 September 1974, Malaysia's then prime minister, Tun Abdul Razak, announced the appointment of Razaleigh as chairman and Chief Executive of [[PETRONAS]] (Petroliam Nasional Berhad). Tun Razak said:'' \"From among the new blood, I intended to bring Tengku Razaleigh into the Cabinet. However, I have an important job for him, a job as important as that of a Cabinet Minister. I have decided to appoint him as chairman and Chief Executive of PETRONAS, which is equivalent to being a Cabinet Minister.\"''.<ref>The Straits Times 7 September 1974 page 8, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> Subsequently, Razaleigh had to relinquish his job as Chairman of PERNAS which he held from 1970, but retained the chairmanship of Bank Bumiputra.[[File:TRH_Petronas_Delegation_Houston.jpg|right|thumb|Tengku Razaleigh accompanying Tun Razak in a Petronas Delegation to Houston]]\n\n=== Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) ===\n\nThe company was founded on 17 March 1978 based on an idea from Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, as an instrument of the Government's New Economic Policy to promote share ownership among the Bumiputera, and to develop opportunities for deserving Bumiputera professionals to participate in the creation and management of wealth.\n\nToday, PNB is a major investor in Bursa Malaysia, investing nearly 10% of the market capitalisation of the bourse, across most major Malaysian corporations and also actively contributing towards the nation\u2019s human capital development through scholarships and employment opportunities.\n\n===Setting up banking firms and other institutions===\n\nHe also set up \"Bank Pembangunan Malaysia\" and founded and established both Bank Islam and Syarikat Takaful, an insurance company run in accordance with Syariah principles.\n\nInstitute of Marketing Malaysia (IMM) was founded by Razaleigh in 1977 and he became the Institute's first Patron.\n\n===Malaysian & Asean Chamber of Commerce===\n\nRazaleigh was President of Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, President of Malaysian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and consequently the President of ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  He played a major role in the strategic restructuring of the Malaysian economy.  The Malaysian Chamber of Commerce acknowledged his expertise in the petroleum business and once called him the \"Malaysian Oil Prince\".  In the 1975 Malaysian Chamber of Commerce resolution, Razaleigh was named \"Father of Malaysian Economic Development\".\n\n==1960s : The early years==\nAs the former president of the Malayan Students Union in London and secretary of the Malay Society in Britain, Razaleigh has entered into politics on 23 April 1962. He was unanimously elected as chairman of the Ulu Kelantan Division of UMNO at its annual meeting. He had returned to Malaya earlier that year to attend the funeral of his father.<ref>The Straits Times 24 April 1962 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Perubahan besar dalam UMNO Kelantan|last = Hashim|first = Zakaria|date = 18 July 1962|work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = Straits Times|newspaper = Berita Harian|location = Singapore|page = Page 5|language = Malay}}</ref>\n\nTengku Razaleigh was part of the Malaya's delegation to the [[United Nation]] for 17th Session of the U.N.

Him, being of royal blood has the right to use the combined title of 'Yang Berhormat' which is the equivalent to 'The Honourable' and 'Yang Mulia' which is equivalent to 'His Highness'. Hence, he has the combined title of Yang Berhormat Mulia. If translated to English, it would be His Highness, The Honourable Tan Sri Tengku.\n\n==1970s : The rise==\nIn 1971, he was elected to the UMNO Supreme Council.

Razaleigh's planning is reputed to have been the main reason the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition, of which UMNO is a member, almost totally defeated the opposition Islamic party of [[PAS (political party)|PAS]] in the [[1978 Malaysian general election|1978 general election]] and the Kelantan state elections of the same year.<ref name=\"fear_45\"/>\n\n==1980s ==\nWhen [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] succeeded Hussein Onn as Prime Minister, he declared the election for the Deputy Presidency of UMNO \u2013 and thus by extension the Deputy Prime Ministership \u2013 was open; he would not support any candidate. Razaleigh joined the fray, and his main opposition was [[Musa Hitam]].<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 42.</ref> Eventually, Musa won the election with 722 votes to Razaleigh's 517 votes, becoming the new Deputy President and Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 204.</ref> Razaleigh blamed himself for taking \"a rather passive stance\" and not having a campaign strategy.<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 112.</ref>\n\nTengku Razaleigh challenged Dr. Mahathir in the [[1987 United Malays National Organisation leadership election|1987 UMNO leadership election]], which Dr. Mahathir managed to retain his party president position. However, UMNO was split into two separate entities as Tengku Razaleigh was left unsatisfied with the result.\n\nThe split forced the Malaysian court to declare UMNO as illegal. Shortly after the court ruling, Dr. Mahathir reestablished UMNO as UMNO Baru (New UMNO), though the new UMNO was badly weakened. Tengku Razaleigh at the same time went on his own path and found a new political party called [[Parti Melayu Semangat 46]] (S46) in 1989. The number 46 refers to the year UMNO was founded.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the [[1993 Malaysian constitutional crisis]], Razaleigh strongly opposed the amendment for Rulers to be tried at court and their legal immunity be stripped. However, his efforts failed to bear fruit as it did not gain enough support. In 1996, Tengku Razaleigh disbanded [[Semangat 46]] and rejoined UMNO.\n\n==2000s==\nIn 2004, he announced his interest for the UMNO top post yet again but failed to garner enough nominations to contest the presidency.\n\n==2010s==\nOn 22 July 2011, [[Angkatan Amanah Merdeka]] (Amanah), a Non-Government Organisation was launched by Razaleigh at Memorial Tunku Abdul Rahman to revive and restore the spirit of Merdeka among Malaysians.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/amanah-diketuai-ku-li-dilancar-jumaat-sandar-amanat-tunku/|title=Amanah diketuai Ku Li dilancar Jumaat, sandar amanat Tunku|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|date=20 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226081953/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/amanah-diketuai-ku-li-dilancar-jumaat-sandar-amanat-tunku/|archivedate=26 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The organisation is led by Razaleigh himself as the President, along with several other public figures and prominent activists.\n\nHe lost his wife, Nur Yvonne Abdullah, who died on June 5, 2015 due to multiple myeloma, a disease she had been suffering from for the previous year.

Several of these initiatives were led by Razaleigh. These initiatives were major corporate takeovers of foreign conglomerates and major industries which was previously owned by foreign shareholders respectively.\n\nDue to his excellent drive and contribution to the country's economy, and his strong economics and finance background, he was entrusted to manage the country's finance and was made the Finance Minister in 1976, Chairman of [[Asian Development Bank]] in 1976, IBRD ([[World Bank]]) and [[IMF]] in 1977, and [[Islamic Development Bank]] in 1978.\n\n===New Straits Times Press===\n\nThe [[New Straits Times Press]] (initially News Straits Times Press Sdn Bhd) was formed by the Directors of the Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad, to acquire a majority shareholding in the company which was the largest mass-circulation news organ in the territories of East and West Malaysia.\n\nThe Malaysia operations of the Straits Times, the Sunday Times, the [[Malay Mail]], the Sunday Mail, [[Berita Harian]] and Berita Minggu were transferred to this new company. An agreement was reached in 1972 between the directors of the ''Straits Times group'' and ''Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah'' for the disposal of 80 per cent of the stock of the News Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. for the Malaysian interest.<ref>The Straits Times 17 September 1972 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n===Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad===\n\nOn 4 June 1965, ''\"Kongres Ekonomi Bumiputra\"'' (Bumiputra Economic Congress), sponsored by the Ministry of National and Rural Development, were held in Kuala Lumpur for 3 days to generate an interest among Malays and other local indigenous groups to participate in commerce and industry. Seven working committees were formed to achieve these objectives.<ref>The Straits Times 5 May 1965 page 18, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n[[Tun Abdul Razak]], the then Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia announced that the Government had agreed to form a local Bank (\"Bank Bumiputra\") as recommended by the Economic Congress based on a majority of the 69 resolutions passed in the meeting.<ref>The Straits Times 8 May 1965 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> The Bank, with its initial capital to be provided by the Malaysian Government, would be established. The Bank's ownership would ultimately be sold to the public through shares. On 15 July 1965, Tun Abdul Razak announced the Government agreed to provide RM5 million as the initial capital for Bank Bumiputra.<ref>The Straits Times 15 July 1965 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> In an event presenting certificate to 80 students at \"Taman Latehan Wanita\", Lornie Road, Tun Abdul Razak reiterated that the main aim of the bank was to assist rural businessmen in the form of loans irrespective of religion.<ref>The Straits Times 4 September 1965 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\nBank Bumiputra Malaysia Berhad was formally launched by Tun Abdul Razak on 1 October 1965 with authorised capital of RM25 million, instead of RM5 million announced earlier.<ref>The Straits Times 1 October 1965 page 1, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> The senior management was headed by Mohd Raslan bin Dato' Abdullah (managing director), former Accountant General of Government and Tengku Razaleigh (Executive Director).

The general manager of the Bank was Wong Aun Pui, a prominent local banker with 20 years of experience and director of many rubber and palm oil companies.<ref>The Straits Times 10 March 1966 page 10, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref>\n\n=== Perbadanan Nasional Berhad (PERNAS) ===\n\nPERNAS (Perbadanan Nasional Berhad or National Corporation) was set up in November 1969 as a wholly owned government company to carry out the resolutions at the Second Bumiputera Economic Congress. Among the major shareholders included were Malaysia's Ministry of Finance, [[Bank Negara Malaysia]] (The Central Bank of Malaysia) and Bank Bumiputera Malaysia Berhad. Pernas was put under a solid footing under the chairmanship of Razaleigh (1970\u20131974) who had been the Minister of Finance from 1976 to 1984.<ref>The Developing Economies, Malaysia's Localization Policy and its impact of British owned Enterprises, Page 372, [[Institute of Developing Economies]], Japan</ref>\n\nWith the background of poor and very low participation of [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputeras]] in the private sector and industries at that time, PERNAS' principle were to:\n* enter undertakings which would bring high economic returns,\n* when enter into joint ventures, PERNAS was to be the majority stockholder with controlling interest over operations,\n* Bumiputeras were to be employed at all levels of operations and undertakings.<ref>The Developing Economies, Malaysia's Localization Policy and its impact of British owned Enterprises, Page 374, [[Institute of Developing Economies]], Japan</ref>\n\n8 subsidiaries were set up under PERNAS to achieve its objective. Malaysia National Insurance Berhad (MNI) was established in April 1970. There followed during 1971 Pernas Construction Sdn. Bhd., Pernas Engineering Sdn. Bhd., and Pernas Securities Sdn. Bhd. Then came Pernas Mining Sdn. Bhd (1973) and Pernas Edar Sdn Bhd (1974).\n\nRazaleigh was in the thick of what became known as the Haw Par imbroglio of the mid-1970s, working with the Singapore-based Haw Par Brothers International Ltd, then an offshoot of the empire of British wheeler-dealer Jim Slater, to acquire control of London Tin Company, the British-controlled tin conglomerate, and the [[Sime Darby]] plantations conglomerate.<ref>The Straits Times 2 January 1976 page 5, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> This was to be achieved through a complex series of transactions by which PERNAS would end up as the largest shareholder of both. It failed when Singapore accused Haw Par of financial irregularities and later jailed a senior executive and the head, Donald Watson, fled to Ireland.\n\nBut it proved a short-lived setback for Razaleigh. Within two years, a share and proxy battle orchestrated by merchant bank Rothschild \u2013 which was also a part owner of Bumiputera Merchant Bankers \u2013 brought Sime Darby under Malaysian control and its headquarters shifted to Kuala Lumpur. Control of London Tin Company was acquired the same year. In another coup in 1979, Malaysian money made a \"dawn raid\" on British plantation giant, Kumpulan Guthrie Bhd, which wrenched the company from British control; most of the other British owned plantations soon followed.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1113&Itemid=31|title=A Onetime Political Star Returns to Malaysia's Stage|date= 24 March 2008|publisher=asiasentinel.com}}</ref>\n\nAmong the major corporate takeover exercise and formation of new businesses during Razaleigh's stewardship as Pernas chairman were\n* Insurance \u2013 [[Malaysia National Insurance]] Bhd,\n* Banking \u2013 [[Maybank]] Bhd,\n* Mining \u2013 the then-largest tin mining company in the world, London Tin Company, which was later renamed [[MMC Corporation Berhad]].\n* Palm Oil and Rubber Producer \u2013 [[Sime Darby]], [[Guthrie (company)|Guthrie]] Berhad, [[Highlands & Lowlands Berhad]].\n\n====Malaysia's first trade delegation to China====\n\n[[File:TRH_Pernas_Meeting_China.jpg|left|thumb|Tengku Razaleigh: Pernas Meeting with Chinese Delegation. Also present was Tun Razak and [[Ong Kee Hui]].]]\nIn 1971, Razaleigh's led trade delegation went to China to initiate a prospect of initiating a business relationship.<ref>The Political Economy of Malaysia's Trade Relation with China, John Wong, Page 9, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies</ref> During the visit to China, Razaleigh managed to meet the then China's Premier [[Zhou En Lai]]. Total trade with China stood at a mere RM105.6 million in 1971, but ballooned to RM1.6 billion in 1980. Since then the contact between the two countries has been on the increase as evidenced by the number of visits of trade, medical and sports delegations to China.\n\n=== Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS)===\n\nOn 6 September 1974, Malaysia's then prime minister, Tun Abdul Razak, announced the appointment of Razaleigh as chairman and Chief Executive of [[PETRONAS]] (Petroliam Nasional Berhad). Tun Razak said:'' \"From among the new blood, I intended to bring Tengku Razaleigh into the Cabinet. However, I have an important job for him, a job as important as that of a Cabinet Minister. I have decided to appoint him as chairman and Chief Executive of PETRONAS, which is equivalent to being a Cabinet Minister.\"''.<ref>The Straits Times 7 September 1974 page 8, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref> Subsequently, Razaleigh had to relinquish his job as Chairman of PERNAS which he held from 1970, but retained the chairmanship of Bank Bumiputra.[[File:TRH_Petronas_Delegation_Houston.jpg|right|thumb|Tengku Razaleigh accompanying Tun Razak in a Petronas Delegation to Houston]]\n\n=== Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB) ===\n\nThe company was founded on 17 March 1978 based on an idea from Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah, as an instrument of the Government's New Economic Policy to promote share ownership among the Bumiputera, and to develop opportunities for deserving Bumiputera professionals to participate in the creation and management of wealth.\n\nToday, PNB is a major investor in Bursa Malaysia, investing nearly 10% of the market capitalisation of the bourse, across most major Malaysian corporations and also actively contributing towards the nation\u2019s human capital development through scholarships and employment opportunities.\n\n===Setting up banking firms and other institutions===\n\nHe also set up \"Bank Pembangunan Malaysia\" and founded and established both Bank Islam and Syarikat Takaful, an insurance company run in accordance with Syariah principles.\n\nInstitute of Marketing Malaysia (IMM) was founded by Razaleigh in 1977 and he became the Institute's first Patron.\n\n===Malaysian & Asean Chamber of Commerce===\n\nRazaleigh was President of Malay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, President of Malaysian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and consequently the President of ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  He played a major role in the strategic restructuring of the Malaysian economy.  The Malaysian Chamber of Commerce acknowledged his expertise in the petroleum business and once called him the \"Malaysian Oil Prince\".  In the 1975 Malaysian Chamber of Commerce resolution, Razaleigh was named \"Father of Malaysian Economic Development\".\n\n==1960s : The early years==\nAs the former president of the Malayan Students Union in London and secretary of the Malay Society in Britain, Razaleigh has entered into politics on 23 April 1962. He was unanimously elected as chairman of the Ulu Kelantan Division of UMNO at its annual meeting. He had returned to Malaya earlier that year to attend the funeral of his father.<ref>The Straits Times 24 April 1962 page 11, [[National Library, Singapore]]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url = |title = Perubahan besar dalam UMNO Kelantan|last = Hashim|first = Zakaria|date = 18 July 1962|work = |access-date = |via = |publisher = Straits Times|newspaper = Berita Harian|location = Singapore|page = Page 5|language = Malay}}</ref>\n\nTengku Razaleigh was part of the Malaya's delegation to the [[United Nation]] for 17th Session of the U.N.

Him, being of royal blood has the right to use the combined title of 'Yang Berhormat' which is the equivalent to 'The Honourable' and 'Yang Mulia' which is equivalent to 'His Highness'. Hence, he has the combined title of Yang Berhormat Mulia. If translated to English, it would be His Highness, The Honourable Tan Sri Tengku.\n\n==1970s : The rise==\nIn 1971, he was elected to the UMNO Supreme Council.

Razaleigh's planning is reputed to have been the main reason the [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition, of which UMNO is a member, almost totally defeated the opposition Islamic party of [[PAS (political party)|PAS]] in the [[1978 Malaysian general election|1978 general election]] and the Kelantan state elections of the same year.<ref name=\"fear_45\"/>\n\n==1980s ==\nWhen [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] succeeded Hussein Onn as Prime Minister, he declared the election for the Deputy Presidency of UMNO \u2013 and thus by extension the Deputy Prime Ministership \u2013 was open; he would not support any candidate. Razaleigh joined the fray, and his main opposition was [[Musa Hitam]].<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 42.</ref> Eventually, Musa won the election with 722 votes to Razaleigh's 517 votes, becoming the new Deputy President and Deputy Prime Minister.<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 204.</ref> Razaleigh blamed himself for taking \"a rather passive stance\" and not having a campaign strategy.<ref>Tan & Vasil, p. 112.</ref>\n\nTengku Razaleigh challenged Dr. Mahathir in the [[1987 United Malays National Organisation leadership election|1987 UMNO leadership election]], which Dr. Mahathir managed to retain his party president position. However, UMNO was split into two separate entities as Tengku Razaleigh was left unsatisfied with the result.\n\nThe split forced the Malaysian court to declare UMNO as illegal. Shortly after the court ruling, Dr. Mahathir reestablished UMNO as UMNO Baru (New UMNO), though the new UMNO was badly weakened. Tengku Razaleigh at the same time went on his own path and found a new political party called [[Parti Melayu Semangat 46]] (S46) in 1989. The number 46 refers to the year UMNO was founded.\n\n==1990s==\nIn the [[1993 Malaysian constitutional crisis]], Razaleigh strongly opposed the amendment for Rulers to be tried at court and their legal immunity be stripped. However, his efforts failed to bear fruit as it did not gain enough support. In 1996, Tengku Razaleigh disbanded [[Semangat 46]] and rejoined UMNO.\n\n==2000s==\nIn 2004, he announced his interest for the UMNO top post yet again but failed to garner enough nominations to contest the presidency.\n\n==2010s==\nOn 22 July 2011, [[Angkatan Amanah Merdeka]] (Amanah), a Non-Government Organisation was launched by Razaleigh at Memorial Tunku Abdul Rahman to revive and restore the spirit of Merdeka among Malaysians.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/amanah-diketuai-ku-li-dilancar-jumaat-sandar-amanat-tunku/|title=Amanah diketuai Ku Li dilancar Jumaat, sandar amanat Tunku|publisher=The Malaysian Insider|date=20 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226081953/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/bahasa/article/amanah-diketuai-ku-li-dilancar-jumaat-sandar-amanat-tunku/|archivedate=26 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The organisation is led by Razaleigh himself as the President, along with several other public figures and prominent activists.\n\nHe lost his wife, Nur Yvonne Abdullah, who died on June 5, 2015 due to multiple myeloma, a disease she had been suffering from for the previous year.

He spends most of his time in his apartment and avoids human contact other than regular trips to a local diner, mass at a nearby church, [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo games]], and to the hospital, where he purchases donated blood from a hospital intern, Jeremy. Upon returning home from one trip, Jack is confronted by mobsters Steve and Short, who are looking for Jeremy.\n\nJack's routine is further interrupted by a phone call from his ex-girlfriend, Gillian, asking him to find their adult daughter, Andrea, who tried to contact him earlier that day. Unhappy, Jack agrees to locate Andrea, but stresses that he wants no further contact with Gillian. He finds Andrea and takes her with him to the diner he frequents, where she meets Cara, a waitress with a crush on Jack. While Jack slowly bonds with Andrea he sees visions of an old man with a goatee, wearing a porkpie hat, and also manages to foil Steve and Short's attempt to kidnap Jeremy. Jack is surprised when he discovers that Andrea can also see the man, as previously only Jack could see him.\n\nOut for vengeance, Short and Steve try to murder Jack, only for Jack to kill Short by tearing out his throat with his bare hands, which he then eats, giving in to his craving for human flesh. Afraid that he'll do the same to Andrea, Jack forces her to leave the apartment. Shortly afterwards Jack kills and eats an obnoxious neighbor. Later, he walks around the city trying to pick fights with various strangers, all of whom refuse to reciprocate his aggression. Eventually, he comes across three young men spoiling for a fight, culminating in him killing one or more of them. Jack ultimately receives a phone call from the mobsters, who inform him that they have killed Gillian and kidnapped Andrea and will kill her if he does not surrender. Jack tries to confront Alex, a local crime boss, and the man he believes is responsible, only for Alex to deny that he had anything to do with the kidnapping.\n\nUpset, Jack goes to the diner, where he bribes Cara into helping him save Andrea by offering her a million dollars. She discovers that Jack is actually the Biblical figure [[Cain and Abel|Cay'in (Cain)]], doomed to live as a seeming immortal cannibal, perhaps  for killing Haq'bal (whom the [[Hebrew Bible]] identifies as his brother, Abel). Jack ultimately discovers the reason why the mobsters were after Jeremy: he had borrowed a large sum of money to pay off his student loans, without repaying it. He also learns of Andrea's whereabouts and goes to rescue her. Alex reveals that he kidnapped Andrea as revenge for Jack killing Alex's father, a mobster Jack once worked for. Just as Jack is about to murder Alex, the man with the goatee arrives, prompting Jack to angrily confront him over his punishment for murdering Abel. Jack demands to know why the man won't let him die, with the implication that the old man is either Death, or Satan because God is referred to as She during Jack's confrontation with the man.

He spends most of his time in his apartment and avoids human contact other than regular trips to a local diner, mass at a nearby church, [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo games]], and to the hospital, where he purchases donated blood from a hospital intern, Jeremy. Upon returning home from one trip, Jack is confronted by mobsters Steve and Short, who are looking for Jeremy.\n\nJack's routine is further interrupted by a phone call from his ex-girlfriend, Gillian, asking him to find their adult daughter, Andrea, who tried to contact him earlier that day. Unhappy, Jack agrees to locate Andrea, but stresses that he wants no further contact with Gillian. He finds Andrea and takes her with him to the diner he frequents, where she meets Cara, a waitress with a crush on Jack. While Jack slowly bonds with Andrea he sees visions of an old man with a goatee, wearing a porkpie hat, and also manages to foil Steve and Short's attempt to kidnap Jeremy. Jack is surprised when he discovers that Andrea can also see the man, as previously only Jack could see him.\n\nOut for vengeance, Short and Steve try to murder Jack, only for Jack to kill Short by tearing out his throat with his bare hands, which he then eats, giving in to his craving for human flesh. Afraid that he'll do the same to Andrea, Jack forces her to leave the apartment. Shortly afterwards Jack kills and eats an obnoxious neighbor. Later, he walks around the city trying to pick fights with various strangers, all of whom refuse to reciprocate his aggression. Eventually, he comes across three young men spoiling for a fight, culminating in him killing one or more of them. Jack ultimately receives a phone call from the mobsters, who inform him that they have killed Gillian and kidnapped Andrea and will kill her if he does not surrender. Jack tries to confront Alex, a local crime boss, and the man he believes is responsible, only for Alex to deny that he had anything to do with the kidnapping.\n\nUpset, Jack goes to the diner, where he bribes Cara into helping him save Andrea by offering her a million dollars. She discovers that Jack is actually the Biblical figure [[Cain and Abel|Cay'in (Cain)]], doomed to live as a seeming immortal cannibal, perhaps  for killing Haq'bal (whom the [[Hebrew Bible]] identifies as his brother, Abel). Jack ultimately discovers the reason why the mobsters were after Jeremy: he had borrowed a large sum of money to pay off his student loans, without repaying it. He also learns of Andrea's whereabouts and goes to rescue her. Alex reveals that he kidnapped Andrea as revenge for Jack killing Alex's father, a mobster Jack once worked for. Just as Jack is about to murder Alex, the man with the goatee arrives, prompting Jack to angrily confront him over his punishment for murdering Abel. Jack demands to know why the man won't let him die, with the implication that the old man is either Death, or Satan because God is referred to as She during Jack's confrontation with the man. Jack ends up choosing to spare Alex in favor of helping Andrea seek medical attention. Before leaving with Cara and Andrea, Jack promises Alex that one day he will see the goateed man. After they have left, the goateed man appears to the very injured Alex, greeting him with a resonant otherworldly-sounding voice.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Castlist|\n*[[Henry Rollins]] as Jack\n*[[Booboo Stewart]] as Jeremy\n*[[Steven Ogg]] as Alex\n*[[Jordan Todosey]] as Andrea Huntsman\n*[[Kate Greenhouse]] as Cara\n*[[James Cade]] as Short\n*[[Michael Cram]] as Tim\n*[[David Richmond-Peck]] as Steve\n*Elias Edraki as Ben\n*Walter Alza as Derrick\n*[[Don Francks]] as The Man with the Goatee\n*[[Aron Tager]] as an announcer\n}}\n\n==Miniseries==\nIn October 2014 it was announced that 108 Media were shopping the rights for a miniseries version of ''He Never Died'', which would further expand the film's story and history of the central character Jack.<ref name=variety>{{cite web|last1=Punter|first1=Jennie|title=Henry Rollins to Star in Comedy-Horror Miniseries \u2018He Never Died\u2019 (EXCLUSIVE)|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/henry-rollins-to-star-in-comedy-horror-miniseries-he-never-died-exclusive-1201334751/|publisher=Variety|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> Director Krawczyk is set to return as the director for the miniseries and Rollins is attached to return to portray his character Jack.<ref name=variety />\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=September 2017}}\nCritical reception for ''He Never Died'' has been mostly positive.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gingold|first1=Michael|title=\"HE NEVER DIED\" (SXSW Movie Review)|url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/he-never-died-sxsw-movie-review/|publisher=Fangoria|accessdate=24 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223182046/http://www.fangoria.com/new/he-never-died-sxsw-movie-review/|archive-date=23 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Film School Rejects]] and [[Dread Central]] both wrote positive reviews for the film,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tinnin|first1=Drew|title=He Never Died (2015)|url=https://dreadcentral.com/reviews/93818/he-never-died-2015/|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> and Film School Rejects wrote that it was \"laugh out loud funny thanks almost exclusively to Rollins\u2019 delivery and reaction shots, but the acts of violence and character details are just as entertaining.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hunter|first1=Rob|title=SXSW 2015: He Never Died is a Bloody, Hilarious and Smart Slice of Supernatural Noir |url=http://filmschoolrejects.com/reviews/he-never-died.php|publisher=Film School Rejects|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> We Got This Covered was more mixed in their review, which stated that \"''He Never Died'' is a genre movie that refuses to let itself be defined, but the film's guessing game grows tiresome as the questions only continue to mount.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Donato|first1=Matt|title=He Never Died Review [SXSW 2015]|url=https://wegotthiscovered.com/movies/he-never-died-review-sxsw-2015/|publisher=We Got This Covered|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* [[He's Got The Whole World In His Hands]] by Charlie Kim \n* (If) You Want Trouble by Nick Waterhouse\n* Hate In My Heart by Inger Lorre & the chiefs of infinity\n* Quiet Man by Judy Klass Band (demo song) recently cut by Mary Resek\n* [[A Question of Balance|Melancholy Man]] by [[The Moody Blues]]\n* Sellout by Sri  \n* I'm Gonna Count My Sheep by Missouri Jazz Band (uncredited song during Bingo scene)\n\n==Sequel/Remake==\nIn April 2019 the director, Audrey Cummings, surprised audiences by releasing a brand new film titled 'She Who Died' starring [[Olunike Adeliyi]] which he describes as a 'remake' of his original film.

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting.

While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career.

Influenced by [[Impressionism]] and the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] masters from a young age, he became increasingly attracted to [[Cubism]] and avant-garde movements.<ref>Gibson, Ian, The Shameful Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed, London, Faber and Faber, 1997, Chs 2, 3</ref> He moved closer to Surrealism in the late 1920s and joined the Surrealist group in 1929, soon becoming one of its leading exponents. His best-known work, ''[[The Persistence of Memory]]'', was completed in August 1931, and is one of the most famous Surrealist paintings. Dal\u00ed lived in France throughout the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936 to 1939) before leaving for the United States in 1940 where he achieved commercial success. He returned to Catalonia in 1948 where he announced his return to the Catholic faith and developed his \"nuclear mysticism\" style, based on his interest in classicism, mysticism and recent scientific developments.<ref>Gibson, Ian, ''The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (1997)</ref> \n\nDal\u00ed's artistic repertoire included painting, graphic arts, film, sculpture, design and photography, at times in collaboration with other artists. He also wrote fiction, poetry, autobiography, essays and criticism. Major themes in his work include dreams, the subconscious, sexuality, religion, science and his closest personal relationships. To the dismay of those who held his work in high regard, and to the irritation of his critics, his eccentric and ostentatious public behavior sometimes drew more attention than his artwork.<ref>{{cite web |last=Saladyga |first=Stephen Francis |url=http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |title=The Mindset of Salvador Dal\u00ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906040713/http://purple.niagara.edu/jlittle/lamplighter/saladyga.htm |archive-date=6 September 2006 |work=Lamplighter |publisher=[[Niagara University]] |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=2006 |access-date=22 July 2006}}</ref><ref name=Meisler>{{cite web|last1=Meisler|first1=Stanley|title=The Surreal World of Salvador Dal\u00ed|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-surreal-world-of-salvador-dali-78993324/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|accessdate=12 July 2014|date=April 2005}}</ref> His public support for the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]], his commercial activities and the quality and authenticity of some of his late works have also been controversial.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), ''passim''</ref> His life and work were an important influence on other Surrealists, [[pop art]] and contemporary artists such as [[Jeff Koons]] and [[Damien Hirst|Damien Hurst]].<ref>Koons, Jeff (March 2005). \"Who Paints Bread Better than Dali\".

Dal\u00ed refused, perhaps out of fear of expulsion from the Surrealist group, and was violently thrown out of his paternal home on 28 December 1929. His father told him that he would be [[Inheritance|disinherited]], and that he should never set foot in Cadaqu\u00e9s again. The following summer, Dal\u00ed and Gala rented a small fisherman's cabin in a nearby bay at [[Port Lligat]].

The 14 oil paintings and other works in the exhibition reflected Dal\u00ed's increasing interest in atomic physics. Notable works included ''Dematerialization Near the Nose of Nero (The Separation of the Atom)'', ''Intra-Atomic Equilibrium of a Swan's Feather'', and a study for ''[[Leda Atomica]]''.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will. A two-year legal dispute followed over paintings and drawings Dal\u00ed had left in his family home, during which Dal\u00ed was accused of assaulting a public notary.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), pp 454-61</ref>\n\nAs Dal\u00ed moved further towards embracing Catholicism he introduced more religious iconography and themes in his painting. In 1949 he painted a study for ''[[The Madonna of Port Lligat]]'' (first version, 1949) and showed it to Pope Pius XII during an audience arranged to discuss Dali's marriage to Gala.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 450-53</ref> This work was a precursor to the phase Dal\u00ed dubbed \"Nuclear Mysticism,\" a fusion of Einsteinian physics, classicism and Catholic mysticism.

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nDal\u00ed worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Workers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist group grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the group.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist group.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''[[The First Days of Spring]]'' (1929), ''[[The Great Masturbator]]'' (1929) and ''[[The Lugubrious Game]]'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behavior throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!
