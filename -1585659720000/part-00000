{"title_page": "Interpretations of quantum mechanics", "text_new": "{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Interpretations}}\nAn '''interpretation of quantum mechanics''' is an attempt to explain how the mathematical theory of [[quantum mechanics]] \"corresponds\" to [[reality]]. Although quantum mechanics has held up to rigorous and extremely precise tests in an extraordinarily broad range of experiments (not one prediction from quantum mechanics is found to be contradicted by experiments), there exist a number of contending schools of thought over their interpretation.  These views on interpretation differ on such fundamental questions as whether quantum mechanics is [[determinism|deterministic]] or [[stochastic|stochastic]], which elements of quantum mechanics can be considered \"real\", and what is the nature of measurement, among other matters.\n\nDespite nearly a century of debate and experiment, no consensus has been reached among physicists and [[Philosophy of physics|philosophers of physics]] concerning which interpretation best \"represents\" reality.<ref>\nMurray Gell-Mann - Quantum Mechanics Interpretations - Feynman Sum over Histories - EPR Bertlemann's\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-OFP5tNtMY\nRichard P Feynman: Quantum Mechanical View of Reality 1 (Part 1)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72us6pnbEvE\n</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schlosshauer|first=Maximilian|last2=Kofler|first2=Johannes|last3=Zeilinger|first3=Anton|date=2013-08-01|title=A snapshot of foundational attitudes toward quantum mechanics|url=|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=44|issue=3|pages=222\u2013230|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2013.04.004|issn=1355-2198|arxiv=1301.1069|bibcode=2013SHPMP..44..222S}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{multiple image\n| header            = Influential figures in the interpretation of quantum mechanics\n| header_align      = center<!-- left/right/ -->\n| header_background = #CCCCFF\n|align=right\n|direction=horizontal\n|image1=Erwin Schrodinger2.jpg\n|caption1=[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]\n|width1=150\n|image2=Max Born.jpg\n|caption2=[[Max Born|Born]]\n|width2=147\n|image3=Niels Bohr.jpg\n|caption3=[[Niels Bohr|Bohr]]\n|width3=135\n}}\nThe definition of quantum theorists' terms, such as ''[[wave function]]s'' and ''[[matrix mechanics]]'', progressed through many stages.

The main conclusion of the authors is that \"the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme\", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:\n:\"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll.\"\n\n== Nature ==\nMore or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:\n# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''\u2014a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions\n# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''\u2014a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world\nTwo qualities vary among interpretations:\n# [[Ontology]]\u2014claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world\n# [[Epistemology]]\u2014claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world\n\nIn [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually \"governs\" outcomes\u2014and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism\u2014is a [[category mistake]].\n\nIn a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]\u2014approximately true description or explanation of the natural world\u2014or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.\n\n{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], \"Shut up and calculate\", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase \"shut up and calculate\", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could Feynman have said this?|journal=[[Physics Today]]|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10\u201311|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N. David|bibcode=2004PhT....57e..10M}}</ref>\n\nOther approaches to resolve conceptual problems introduce new mathematical formalism, and so propose alternative theories with their interpretations.  An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms\u2014[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]'s [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]\u2014has been demonstrated.\n\n== Interprative Challenges ==\n\n# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.\n# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. \n# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.<ref>Guido Bacciagaluppi, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.</ref>\n# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].<ref>''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.</ref>\n# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see \"[[Quantum logic]]\").  Like contextuality, the \"origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators\" that describe quantum objects (Omn\u00e8s 1999).\n# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.\n# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.\n\n== Influential Interpretations ==\n\n=== Other interpretations ===\n{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nAs well as the mainstream interpretations discussed below, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].\n\n=== The EPR Paradox ===\nThe current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete? | url =http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf | journal = Phys.

They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.\n\nDeterminism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.\n\nLocal realism has two aspects:\n* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;\n* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.\n\nA precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].\n\n[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nRegardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.\n\n=== Copenhagen interpretation ===\n{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the \"standard\" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like \"where was the particle before I measured its position?\" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], \"reality is in the observations, not in the electron\".<ref>http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf</ref> In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.\n\n=== Quantum information theories ===\n[[Quantum information]]al approaches<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.quantum.at/fileadmin/links/newscientist/bit.html\n | title=In the beginning was the bit\n | work=New Scientist\n | date=2001-02-17\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref> have attracted growing support.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science-columnists/ci_22444536/kate-becker-quantum-physics-has-been-rankling-scientists\n | title=Quantum physics has been rankling scientists for decades\n | work=Boulder Daily Camera\n | author=Kate Becker\n | date=2013-01-25\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  They subdivide into two kinds.<ref>[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/iii_2.pdf Information, Immaterialism, Instrumentalism: Old and New in Quantum Information.] Christopher G.

Cit.: \"Let us call the thought that information might be the basic category from which all else flows informational immaterialism.\"</ref>\n* Interpretations where quantum mechanics is said to describe an observer's knowledge of the world, rather than the world itself. This approach has some similarity with Bohr's thinking.<ref>\"Physics concerns what we can say about nature\". (Niels Bohr, quoted in Petersen, A. (1963). The philosophy of Niels Bohr. ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'', 19(7):8\u201314.)</ref> Collapse (also known as reduction) is often interpreted as an observer acquiring information from a measurement, rather than as an objective event. These approaches have been appraised as similar to [[instrumentalism]].\n<blockquote>\nThe state is not an objective property of an individual system but is that information, obtained from a knowledge of how a system was prepared, which can be used for making predictions about future measurements.\n...A quantum mechanical state being a summary of the observer's information about an individual physical system changes both by dynamical laws, and whenever the observer acquires new information about the system through the process of measurement. The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The \"reduction of the wavepacket\" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of \"state\" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any \"measurement event\" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-relational/\n |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu\n |date=\n |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref><ref>For more information, see {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02302261 |author=Carlo Rovelli |year=1996 |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1637\u20131678 |arxiv=quant-ph/9609002|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R |authorlink= Carlo Rovelli }}</ref>\n\nAn independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,<ref>David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965</ref> in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector.

The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly \"splitting\" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories\u2014effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].\n\n=== Consistent histories ===\n{{Main|Consistent histories}}\n\nThe [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\nAccording to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).\n\n=== Ensemble interpretation ===\n{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}\n\nThe [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles.

Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction.  The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Principle of locality|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint. The theory is considered to be a [[hidden-variable theory]], and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell's inequality. The [[measurement problem]] is resolved, since the particles have definite positions at all times.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Maudlin | first1 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Why Bohm's Theory Solves the Measurement Problem | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/557e16347518003aa208a20ed704220e5706fc6d| journal = Philosophy of Science | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 479\u2013483 | doi=10.1086/289879}}</ref> Collapse is explained as [[wikt:phenomenology|phenomenological]].<ref name=\"CushingFine2013\">{{cite arXiv |last1=Durr |first1=D. |last2=Zanghi |first2=N. |last3=Goldstein |first3=S.|eprint=quant-ph/9511016 |title=''Bohmian Mechanics as the Foundation of Quantum Mechanics ''|date=Nov 14, 1995 }} Also published in {{cite book|author1=J.T.

It was proposed in 2003 by [[Wojciech Zurek]] and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout. The development of the theory is due to the integration of a number of Zurek\u2019s research topics pursued over the course of twenty-five years including: [[pointer state]]s, [[einselection]] and [[decoherence]].\n\n=== Transactional interpretation ===\n{{Main|Transactional interpretation}}\nThe [[transactional interpretation]] of quantum mechanics (TIQM) by [[John G. Cramer]] is an interpretation of quantum mechanics inspired by the [[Wheeler\u2013Feynman absorber theory]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/qm_nl.html\n |title       = Quantum Nocality \u2013 Cramer\n |publisher   = Npl.washington.edu\n |accessdate  = 2011-01-24\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101229074514/http://www.npl.washington.edu/npl/int_rep/qm_nl.html\n |archivedate = 2010-12-29\n}}</ref> It describes the collapse of the wave function as resulting from a time-symmetric transaction between a possibility wave from the source to the receiver (the wave function) and a possibility wave from the receiver to source (the complex conjugate of the wave function).  This interpretation of quantum mechanics is unique in that it not only views the wave function as a real entity, but the complex conjugate of the wave function, which appears in the Born rule for calculating the expected value for an observable, as also real.\n\n=== Stochastic mechanics ===\n{{Main|Stochastic interpretation}}\nAn entirely classical derivation and interpretation of Schr\u00f6dinger's wave equation by analogy with [[Brownian motion]] was suggested by [[Princeton University]] professor [[Edward Nelson]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nelson | first1 = E | year = 1966 | title = Derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger Equation from Newtonian Mechanics | url = | journal = Phys.

In objective theories, collapse occurs either randomly (\"spontaneous localization\") or when some physical threshold is reached, with observers having no special role.  Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.  Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; QM would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct. The requirement for an extension to QM means that objective collapse is more of a theory than an interpretation.

This research area and its name originated in the 1936 paper by [[Garrett Birkhoff]] and [[John von Neumann]], who attempted to reconcile some of the apparent inconsistencies of classical boolean logic with the facts related to measurement and observation in quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Modal interpretations of quantum theory ===\nModal interpretations of quantum mechanics were first conceived of in 1972 by B. van Fraassen, in his paper \"A formal approach to the philosophy of science.\"  However, this term now is used to describe a larger set of models that grew out of this approach.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to \"become entangled\" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.\n\nNot all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, states that the two-state vector formalism dovetails well with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''.

It also has some resemblance to hidden-variable theories and the ensemble interpretation: particles in BST have multiple well defined trajectories at the microscopic level. These can only be treated stochastically at a coarse grained level, in line with the ensemble interpretation.<ref name=\"Sharlow\">[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3781/1/what_branching_spacetime_might_do.pdf Sharlow, Mark; \"What Branching Spacetime might do for Physics\"] p.2</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nThe most common interpretations are summarized in the table below.

To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to \"interpret\" the theory.  Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.\n\nMost of these interpretations have variants.

The main conclusion of the authors is that \"the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] still reigns supreme\", receiving the most votes in their poll (42%), besides the rise to mainstream notability of the [[many-worlds interpretations]]:\n:\"The  Copenhagen  interpretation  still  reigns  supreme  here,  especially  if  we  lump  it  together  with intellectual offsprings such as [[quantum information|information-based interpretations]] and the [[Quantum Bayesian]] interpretation.  In Tegmark's poll, the Everett interpretation received 17% of the vote, which is similar to the number of votes (18%) in our poll.\"\n\n== Nature ==\nMore or less, all interpretations of quantum mechanics share two qualities:\n# They interpret a ''[[scientific formalism|formalism]]''\u2014a set of equations and principles to generate predictions via input of initial conditions\n# They interpret a ''[[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]''\u2014a set of observations, including those obtained by empirical research and those obtained informally, such as humans' experience of an unequivocal world\nTwo qualities vary among interpretations:\n# [[Ontology]]\u2014claims about what things, such as categories and entities, ''exist'' in the world\n# [[Epistemology]]\u2014claims about the possibility, scope, and means toward relevant ''knowledge'' of the world\n\nIn [[philosophy of science]], the distinction of knowledge versus reality is termed ''[[epistemic]]'' versus ''[[ontic]]''.  A general law is a ''regularity'' of outcomes (epistemic), whereas a causal mechanism may ''regulate'' the outcomes (ontic).  A [[phenomenon]] can receive interpretation either ontic or epistemic.  For instance, [[indeterminism]] may be attributed to limitations of human observation and perception (epistemic), or may be explained as a real existing ''maybe'' encoded in the universe (ontic).  Confusing the epistemic with the ontic, like if one were to presume that a general law actually \"governs\" outcomes\u2014and that the statement of a regularity has the role of a causal mechanism\u2014is a [[category mistake]].\n\nIn a broad sense, scientific theory can be viewed as offering [[scientific realism]]\u2014approximately true description or explanation of the natural world\u2014or might be perceived with antirealism.  A realist stance seeks the epistemic and the ontic, whereas an antirealist stance seeks epistemic but not the ontic.  In the 20th century's first half, antirealism was mainly [[logical positivism]], which sought to exclude unobservable aspects of reality from scientific theory.\n\n{{anchor|shutup}}Since the 1950s, antirealism is more modest, usually [[instrumentalism]], permitting talk of unobservable aspects, but ultimately discarding the very question of realism and posing scientific theory as a tool to help humans make predictions, not to attain [[metaphysical]] understanding of the world.  The instrumentalist view is carried by the famous quote of [[David Mermin]], \"Shut up and calculate\", often misattributed to [[Richard Feynman]].<ref>For a discussion of the provenance of the phrase \"shut up and calculate\", see {{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1768652|title=Could Feynman have said this?|journal=[[Physics Today]]|volume=57|issue=5|pages=10\u201311|year=2004|last1=Mermin|first1=N.

An example is [[Bohmian mechanics]], whose empirical equivalence with the three standard formalisms\u2014[[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger|Schr\u00f6dinger]]'s [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|wave mechanics]], [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]], and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s [[path integral formalism]]\u2014has been demonstrated.\n\n== Interprative Challenges ==\n\n# Abstract, mathematical nature of [[quantum field theories]]: the [[mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics|mathematical structure of quantum mechanics]] is mathematically abstract without clear interpretation of its quantities.\n# Existence of apparently [[quantum indeterminacy|indeterministic]] and irreversible processes: in [[classical field theory]], a physical property at a given location in the field is readily derived.  In most mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics, measurement is given a special role in the theory, as it is the sole process that can cause a nonunitary, irreversible evolution of the state. \n# Role of the [[observer (quantum physics)|observer]] in determining outcomes: the [[Copenhagen Interpretation]] implies that the wavefunction is a calculational tool, and represents reality only immediately after a measurement, perhaps performed by an observer; Everettian interpretations grant that all the possibilities can be real, and that the process of measurement-type interactions cause an effective branching process.<ref>Guido Bacciagaluppi, \"[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/qm-decoherence The role of decoherence in quantum mechanics]\", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2012), Edward N Zalta, ed.</ref>\n# [[Quantum entanglement|Classically unexpected correlations]] between remote objects: [[Quantum entanglement|entangled quantum systems]], as illustrated in the [[EPR paradox]], obey statistics that seem to [[action at a distance (physics)|violate]] [[Principle of locality|principles of local causality]].<ref>''La nouvelle cuisine'', by John S Bell, last article of Speakable and Unspeakable in Quantum Mechanics, second edition.</ref>\n# Complementarity of proffered descriptions: [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]] holds that no set of classical physical concepts can simultaneously refer to all properties of a quantum system.  For instance, wave description ''A'' and particulate description ''B'' can each describe quantum system ''S'', but not simultaneously. This implies the composition of physical properties of ''S'' does not obey the rules of classical [[propositional calculus|propositional logic]] when using propositional connectives (see \"[[Quantum logic]]\").  Like contextuality, the \"origin of complementarity lies in the [[non-commutativity]] of operators\" that describe quantum objects (Omn\u00e8s 1999).\n# Rapidly rising intricacy, far exceeding humans' present calculational capacity, as a system's size increases: since the state space of a quantum system is exponential in the number of subsystems, it is difficult to derive classical approximations.\n# [[Quantum contextuality|Contextual]] behaviour of systems locally: [[Quantum contextuality]] demonstrates that classical intuitions in which properties of a system hold definite values, independent of the manner of their measurement, fails even for local systems. Also, physical principles such as [[Identity of indiscernibles|Leibniz's Principle of the identity of indiscernibles]] no longer apply in the quantum domain, signalling that most classical intuitions may be incorrect about the quantum world.\n\n== Influential Interpretations ==\n\n=== The EPR Paradox ===\nThe current usage of realism and completeness originated in the 1935 paper in which Einstein and others proposed the [[EPR paradox]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Einstein | first1 = A. | last2 = Podolsky | first2 = B. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = N. | year = 1935 | title = Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete? | url =http://cds.cern.ch/record/405662/files/PhysRev.47.777.pdf | journal = Phys.

They characterised element of reality as a quantity whose value can be predicted with certainty before measuring or otherwise disturbing it, and defined a complete physical theory as one in which every element of physical reality is accounted for by the theory. In a semantic view of interpretation, an interpretation is complete if every element of the interpreting structure is present in the mathematics. Realism is also a property of each of the elements of the maths; an element is real if it corresponds to something in the interpreting structure. For example, in some interpretations of quantum mechanics (such as the many-worlds interpretation) the ket vector associated to the system state is said to correspond to an element of physical reality, while in other interpretations it is not.\n\nDeterminism is a property characterizing state changes due to the passage of time, namely that the state at a future instant is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] of the state in the present (see [[time evolution]]). It may not always be clear whether a particular interpretation is deterministic or not, as there may not be a clear choice of a time parameter. Moreover, a given theory may have two interpretations, one of which is deterministic and the other not.\n\nLocal realism has two aspects:\n* The value returned by a measurement corresponds to the value of some function in the state space. In other words, that value is an element of reality;\n* The effects of measurement have a propagation speed not exceeding some universal limit (e.g. the speed of light). In order for this to make sense, measurement operations in the interpreting structure must be localized.\n\nA precise formulation of local realism in terms of a [[local hidden-variable theory]] was proposed by [[John Stewart Bell|John Bell]].\n\n[[Bell's theorem]], combined with experimental testing, restricts the kinds of properties a quantum theory can have, the primary implication being that quantum mechanics cannot satisfy both the [[locality principle|principle of locality]] and [[counterfactual definiteness]].\n\nRegardless of Einstein's concerns about interpretation issues, Dirac and other quantum notables embraced the technical advances of the new theory while devoting little or no attention to interpretational aspects.\n\n=== Copenhagen interpretation ===\n{{Main|Copenhagen interpretation}}\n\nThe [[Copenhagen interpretation]] is the \"standard\" interpretation of quantum mechanics formulated by [[Niels Bohr]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]] while collaborating in Copenhagen around 1927. Bohr and Heisenberg extended the probabilistic interpretation of the wavefunction proposed originally by Max Born. The Copenhagen interpretation rejects questions like \"where was the particle before I measured its position?\" as meaningless. The measurement process randomly picks out exactly one of the many possibilities allowed for by the state's wave function in a manner consistent with the well-defined probabilities that are assigned to each possible state. According to the interpretation, the interaction of an observer or apparatus that is external to the quantum system is the cause of wave function collapse, thus according to [[Paul Davies]], \"reality is in the observations, not in the electron\".<ref>http://www.naturalthinker.net/trl/texts/Heisenberg,Werner/Heisenberg,%20Werner%20-%20Physics%20and%20philosophy.pdf</ref> In general, after a measurement (click of a Geiger counter or a trajectory in a spark or bubble chamber) it ceases to be relevant unless subsequent experimental observations can be performed.\n\n=== Quantum information theories ===\n[[Quantum information]]al approaches<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.quantum.at/fileadmin/links/newscientist/bit.html\n | title=In the beginning was the bit\n | work=New Scientist\n | date=2001-02-17\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref> have attracted growing support.<ref>{{cite news\n | url=http://www.dailycamera.com/science-columnists/ci_22444536/kate-becker-quantum-physics-has-been-rankling-scientists\n | title=Quantum physics has been rankling scientists for decades\n | work=Boulder Daily Camera\n | author=Kate Becker\n | date=2013-01-25\n | accessdate=2013-01-25 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>  They subdivide into two kinds.<ref>[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/iii_2.pdf Information, Immaterialism, Instrumentalism: Old and New in Quantum Information.] Christopher G.

The existence of two laws for the evolution of the state vector...becomes problematical only if it is believed that the state vector is an objective property of the system...The \"reduction of the wavepacket\" does take place in the consciousness of the observer, not because of any unique physical process which takes place there, but only because the state is a construct of the observer and not an objective property of the physical system.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hartle | first1 = J.

Consequently, if quantum mechanics is to be a complete theory, relational quantum mechanics argues that the notion of \"state\" describes not the observed system itself, but the relationship, or correlation, between the system and its observer(s).  The [[Quantum state vector|state vector]] of conventional quantum mechanics becomes a description of the correlation of some ''degrees of freedom'' in the observer, with respect to the observed system.  However, it is held by relational quantum mechanics that this applies to all physical objects, whether or not they are conscious or macroscopic. Any \"measurement event\" is seen simply as an ordinary physical interaction, an establishment of the sort of correlation discussed above.  Thus the physical content of the theory has to do not with objects themselves, but the relations between them.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-relational/\n |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\n |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu\n |date=\n |accessdate=2011-01-24}}</ref><ref>For more information, see {{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02302261 |author=Carlo Rovelli |year=1996 |title=Relational Quantum Mechanics |journal=[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1637\u20131678 |arxiv=quant-ph/9609002|bibcode = 1996IJTP...35.1637R |authorlink= Carlo Rovelli }}</ref>\n\nAn independent [[Relational approach to quantum physics|relational approach to quantum mechanics]] was developed in analogy with David Bohm's elucidation of special relativity,<ref>David Bohm, ''The Special Theory of Relativity'', Benjamin, New York, 1965</ref> in which a detection event is regarded as establishing a relationship between the quantized field and the detector.

QBism draws from the fields of [[quantum information]] and [[Bayesian probability]] and aims to eliminate the interpretational conundrums that have beset quantum theory.\n\nQBism deals with common questions in the interpretation of quantum theory about the nature of [[wavefunction]] [[Quantum superposition|superposition]], [[Measurement problem|quantum measurement]], and [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]].<ref name=\":21\">{{cite journal|last=Timpson|first=Christopher Gordon|year=2008|title=Quantum Bayesianism: A study|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~bras2317/qb_s.ps|format=postscript|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B: Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics|volume=39|issue=3|pages=579\u2013609|arxiv=0804.2047|doi=10.1016/j.shpsb.2008.03.006|via=|accessdate=|bibcode=2008SHPMP..39..579T}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mermin|first=N.

The phenomena associated with measurement are claimed to be explained by [[Quantum decoherence|decoherence]], which occurs when states interact with the environment producing [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]], repeatedly \"splitting\" the universe into mutually unobservable alternate histories\u2014effectively distinct universes within a greater [[multiverse]].\n\n=== Consistent histories ===\n{{Main|Consistent histories}}\n\nThe [[consistent histories]] interpretation generalizes the conventional Copenhagen interpretation and attempts to provide a natural interpretation of [[quantum cosmology]]. The theory is based on a consistency criterion that allows the history of a system to be described so that the probabilities for each history obey the additive rules of classical probability. It is claimed to be [[consistent]] with the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]].\n\nAccording to this interpretation, the purpose of a quantum-mechanical theory is to predict the relative probabilities of various alternative histories (for example, of a particle).\n\n=== Ensemble interpretation ===\n{{Main|Ensemble interpretation}}\n\nThe [[ensemble interpretation]], also called the statistical interpretation, can be viewed as a minimalist interpretation. That is, it claims to make the fewest assumptions associated with the standard mathematics. It takes the statistical interpretation of Born to the fullest extent. The interpretation states that the wave function does not apply to an individual system{{spaced ndash}}for example, a single particle{{spaced ndash}}but is an abstract statistical quantity that only applies to an ensemble (a vast multitude) of similarly prepared systems or particles. In the words of Einstein:\n\n{{Quote|The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which become immediately unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual systems.|Einstein in ''Albert Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist'', ed.

Particles, which always have positions, are guided by the wavefunction.  The wavefunction evolves according to the [[Schr\u00f6dinger wave equation]], and the wavefunction never collapses. The theory takes place in a single space-time, is [[Principle of locality|non-local]], and is deterministic. The simultaneous determination of a particle's position and velocity is subject to the usual [[uncertainty principle]] constraint. The theory is considered to be a [[hidden-variable theory]], and by embracing non-locality it satisfies Bell's inequality.

It was proposed in 2003 by [[Wojciech Zurek]] and a group of collaborators including Ollivier, Poulin, Paz and Blume-Kohout.

Thus, objective-collapse theories are realistic, indeterministic, no-hidden-variables theories.  Standard quantum mechanics does not specify any mechanism of collapse; QM would need to be extended if objective collapse is correct.

This creates [[retrocausality]]: events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future.  In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of [[hidden-variables theory]]), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times.  The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement.  Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality.  The point where two particles appear to \"become entangled\" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.\n\nNot all advocates of time-symmetric causality favour modifying the unitary dynamics of standard quantum mechanics. Thus a leading exponent of the two-state vector formalism, Lev Vaidman, states that the two-state vector formalism dovetails well with [[Hugh Everett]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]].<ref>Yakir Aharonov, Lev Vaidman: ''The Two-State Vector Formalism of Quantum Mechanics: an Updated Review''.

It also has some resemblance to hidden-variable theories and the ensemble interpretation: particles in BST have multiple well defined trajectories at the microscopic level. These can only be treated stochastically at a coarse grained level, in line with the ensemble interpretation.<ref name=\"Sharlow\">[http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3781/1/what_branching_spacetime_might_do.pdf Sharlow, Mark; \"What Branching Spacetime might do for Physics\"] p.2</ref>\n\n=== Other interpretations ===\n{{Main|Minority interpretations of quantum mechanics}}\nAs well as the mainstream interpretations discussed above, a number of other interpretations have been proposed which have not made a significant scientific impact for whatever reason. These range from proposals by mainstream physicists to the more [[occult]] ideas of [[quantum mysticism]].\n\n== Comparisons ==\nThe most common interpretations are summarized in the table below. The values shown in the cells of the table are not without controversy, for the precise meanings of some of the concepts involved are unclear and, in fact, are themselves at the center of the controversy surrounding the given interpretation. For another table comparing interpretations of quantum theory, see reference.<ref>{{Cite book|title=What is quantum information?|last=Olimpia|first=Lombardi|last2=1979-|first2=Fortin, Sebastian|last3=Federico|first3=Holik|last4=Cristian|first4=L\u00f3pez|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=9781107142114|location=|pages=138\u2013144|oclc=965759965|arxiv = 1509.04711|doi = 10.1017/9781316494233.009|chapter = Interpretations of Quantum Theory: A Map of Madness}}</ref>\n\nNo experimental evidence exists that distinguishes among these interpretations. To that extent, the physical theory stands, and is consistent with itself and with reality; difficulties arise only when one attempts to \"interpret\" the theory.  Nevertheless, designing experiments which would test the various interpretations is the subject of active research.\n\nMost of these interpretations have variants. For example, it is difficult to get a precise definition of the Copenhagen interpretation as it was developed and argued about by many people.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The TFD has 94 employees: 92 uniformed firefighters and 2 civilian employees. The department is directly responsible for over 41,000 residents living within the 6.23 square miles of Teaneck. Furthermore, The TFD routinely provides mutual aid to 6 surrounding communities in Bergen County (Boro of Bergenfield, Boro of Bogota, City of Englewood, City of Hackensack, Boro of New Milford and Village of Ridgefield Park), further assisting an additional 139,000 people over an additional 18.52 square miles.\n\n== History ==\nThe first known organized fire protection in Teaneck was provided by the Hackensack Township Protection Society, a part-paid, part-volunteer police organization which also provided organization and equipment for citizens to use in their own rudimentary fire defense. They responded to what is now Teaneck, but with long response times due to poor roads and steep hills. Into the 19th century, The Englewood Fire Department still responded into Teaneck, with similar response time problems.\n\nThe first organized fire company in Teaneck was Defender Hook & Ladder. They were formed on August 12, 1895 and quartered at 722 New Bridge Road, providing first due fire protection in the New Bridge section of Teaneck, lower New Milford and the Cherry Hill section of River Edge. This company did not join the other four independent Teaneck fire companies when the paid municipal fire department was organized in 1915. Instead, it helped supply the nucleus for New Milford Fire Company 2, although it continued to respond in Teaneck until 1933.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/History-2179/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nThe question of forming Teaneck's first volunteer company was first considered in the summer of 1904 by the residents of Manhattan Heights and Selvage developments. Prior to the end of 1904, the residents officially formed the Upper Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association. They organized as Company #1 and were quartered at 1188 Teaneck Road. Organizers included Kenloch V. Ridley and Walter Kaltenback, the first paid chief of department and the first paid firefighter respectively when the department transitioned to a career (paid) department. Company #1 protected north of Cedar Lane to the Bergenfield, the sections of Teaneck known as Manhattan Heights, West Englewood Park and Upper Teaneck. They also responded as the second due engine in the remaining three districts. Company #1 was called upon to fight their first fire on December 8, 1904. On October 6, 1906 they held their first drill. Both of these would be first's in the history of The Teaneck Fire Department. In 1907 the company was forced to move to 18 Fairview Avenue but also obtained Teaneck's first motorized fire apparatus. The building at 18 Fairview Avenue was Fire Headquarters from 1915 until 1920\n\nTeaneck's second volunteer company was formed in 1908 by the residents of Bogota Park as the Cedar Volunteer Firemen's Association and organized Hose Company #2. From 1907 to 1913 they were located in a member's barn on Linden Avenue. Company #2 protected north to West Englewood Park, and west of the West Shore railroad to the Hackensack River. In 1912 a new station was constructed on Kenwood Place which remained Station 2 and housed Engine 2 until 1953.\n\nThe Lower Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association was the third Company was organized in October 1911 as Hose Company #1. They were quartered in a member's barn on the south end of Teaneck Road. They served the section of town known as Lower Teaneck. In 1914 the members rented a garage at 375 Queen Anne Road to store equipment and serve the expanding South Queen Anne Road business district. Shortly before World War I, in 1913 the Company acquired two building lots on Morningside Terrace, and in 1920 completed building their quarters on the lots. This was 395 Morningside Terrace which was Station 3 and housed Engine 3 from 1920 until 1990.\n\nThe Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen's Association, the 4th and final volunteer company, was organized in 1911 and quartered in a blacksmith shop at Glenwood Ave and Fabry Terrace until 1913. In 1913 they relocated to Glenwood Ave and Hemlock Terrace South. When Teaneck went to a career department in 1915, The Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen retained their status as a complete volunteer company and responded to first alarm fires in their district and also to second alarm fires in all other parts of the Township. They remained active until 1948 when they were disbanded and its members went on to organize the [https://www.teaneckambulance.org/ Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/|title=A Brief History of The Teaneck Fire Department|last=Robertson|first=Larry|date=|website=Teaneck.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 American LaFrance Type 75.jpg|1920 American LaFrance Type 75\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon.jpg|1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon\nFile:1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon.jpg|1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck.jpg|1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1926 American LaFrance Type 94 Converted Quadruple Truck.jpg|1926 American LaFrance Type 14 Converted Quadruple Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1929 American LaFrance Type 145.jpg|1929 American LaFrance Type 145\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine.jpg|1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department Chiefs Car 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan.jpg|Chief of Department's 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Teaneck's Fire Chiefs<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teaneck.org/virtualvillage/firedept/100th_Anniversary.html|title=Teaneck Public Library|website=www.teaneck.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|Kenloch V.

Prior to them, \"banging\" locomotive rims were the primary means of alerting the department of a fire. In 1895, Locomotive rims were mounted on gallows with enameled signs. When there was a fire, residents would take a bent metal flat stock, go to the nearest \"gong\" and tap out the number, according to the number code on the sign. Other residents hearing the signal was then expected to repeat the signal at the gong nearest them. There were up to 46 gongs throughout the town, this lasted up until 1920.\n\n===== 1920 - 1948 =====\n\nIn 1920, residents began to dial the operator and ask for the Teaneck Fire Department to report a fire. The operator then transferred the call to the Teaneck Fire Department. The firefighter on the desk (deskman) would then ring the appropriate fire stations on a plug-type switchboard. This ring would set off World War I surplus air raid sirens at the fire stations. Members reporting to the stations to answer the alarm would pick up the phone. This would stop the siren and allow members to copy dispatch info onto a chalkboard. These lines were leased from New York Telephone.\n\nIn 1929, an extension from the Teaneck Police Department was connected to the Fire Department switchboard. There were 46 Police call boxes, painted red and left unlocked. Red and white rings were painted on the utility poles where the box was located. Also during the year, the Teaneck Chamber of Commerce began to push for a better fire alarm system. During 1932 the leased phone lines began to give problems to the TFD and a resident. Alarms rang a home phone on Penn Avenue and telephone calls to the same resident set off the air raid sirens at Station 2. The Teaneck Fire Department also produced new box number locations.\n\nIn 1933, the air raid siren at Fire Headquarters was replaced with an air horn. The air horn sounded the box numbers and special signals.\n\n1937 marked the introduction of the telegraph fire alarm boxes in Teaneck. 40 boxes were placed in service. Bells were installed in the fire houses.\n\nIn 1940, the air raid sirens were used only for air raid warnings and snow days. Phone lines to the stations became municipal. The telegraph box system was made up of 4 box circuits and 1 local circuit in headquarters which was connected to a 16\" gong.\n\n1940 through 1957 saw significant changes for communication with the implementation of voice radio. A two-way radio was installed in the Chief's car and Rescue 1. The radio frequency was 1630KC AM with an FCC Call Sign of KEE888. Radios were installed in the fire stations. Upon an alarm, two taps sounded on the Headquarters circuit and the box number was sounded on the station bells and over the air horns. Two announcements were made over the municipal voice lines to the stations. Each station had an amplifier and a speaker. There would be two tones then the announcement of the alarm over the radio.\n\nIn 1948, Teaneck Fire switched over to 33.8600&nbsp;MHz AM, with the same Call sign. Also, 1948 marked the introduction of Master Boxes to the Teaneck Telegraph Fire Alarm System. All schools, a car dealership, a chemical test facility, a bowling alley, a night club and two taxpayer buildings were the first the Master Box customers.\n\n===== 1957 - 1988 =====\n\nFrom 1957\u20131988, the number of circuits expanded to 16 box circuits and 2 alarm circuits. The use of the air horn was limited to General Alarms. The Teaneck Fire Department switched to 155.6100, sharing the frequency with the Police and DPW. By 1960 all apparatus had two-way radios. In 1968, the boxes were revised, splitting the town up into 6 zones rather than 4. In 1969, the Teaneck Fire Department split off and began operating on 158.8200. From 1970 - 1972, many street boxes were added, as well as numerous master boxes.\n\n===== 1988 - 1997 =====\nMunicipal voice lines to the stations and police were placed out of service. Box numbers were no longer sent out over the bells for telephone alarms of fire. Radios in the stations were replaced with tone-activated models. The two taps were no longer sent over the circuits.\n\nIn 1995, The Teaneck Fire Department added radio alarm boxes to the system.\n\nIn 1997, Municipal voice lines were reestablished to the stations and Police Headquarters. A voice line from Fire Headquarters to the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps was established. Dispatch procedures remained the same. The inside wire was used primarily for administrative messages, but sometimes used for dispatching during multiple alarms ongoing. 13 radio tie lines were also incorporated into the system. Also, a fireground frequency of 156.000&nbsp;MHz was established.\n\n===== 2003 - Present =====\nIn 2003, Computer communications (via T1 lines) was established to all stations (Police, DPW, TVAC, Recreation Department and Municipal Court). These lines were piggybacked on the fire alarm cables. Teaneck has the traditional telegraph boxes (both Gamewell and SAFA) and also has wireless radio boxes. Teaneck has about 33 radio boxes. Teaneck continues to add telegraph boxes to their system. The telegraph system gets quite a workout in Teaneck as it receives many box pulls for confirmed fires.\n\nTeaneck's 2002 Annual Township Managers Report states, \"Teaneck's municipal fire alarm system continued to be the best way to report fires, smoke and other emergencies to the Fire Department. In August 2002, Teaneck suffered a wide area failure of commercial telephone service when a severe lightning storm knocked out hundreds of phone lines in the northwest section of Teaneck. While the telephone company diligently sent a large force and immediately began repairs, many households lacked telephone service for up to four days.\" The report continued on saying \"In 2002, 91 fires and emergencies were reported via the fire alarm boxes. The instant alarm signals helped limit the damage and injuries in fires occurring at [Holy Name Hospital], [Glenpointe Marriott], a senior citizen apartment house (twice), a single family home, and other public and commercial occupancies. Dozens of smoke emergencies were signaled through the system, in some cases preventing smoldering materials or objects from reaching the stage of open flaming. In other cases, boxes were used to get help for hazardous conditions, leaks and rescue situations.....There were only 30 street malicious false alarms, less than 1% of Fire Department runs.\"\n\nTeaneck's 2003 Annual Township Managers Report states, \"...boxes were pulled 104 times, of which 18 were malicious false alarms.\"\n\nTeaneck's municipal fire alarm system is continuously maintained and cared for and is still active as of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.backtaps.com/activesystems.htm#Teaneck|title=Towns with Telegraph Fire Alarm Systems Still In Service|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\nTeaneck Fire Department is a career fire department that has 92 uniformed members, out of a total of 94 authorized positions, including 31 officers and 61 firefighters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/Fire/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref> 83 uniformed members are assigned to 4 platoons (shifts) and 9 members are in the administrative, fire prevention and training bureaus.

The tour commander is in charge of the platoon on duty and is usually a Battalion Chief or on occasion the Deputy Chief of Operations (radio [[call sign]]: Car 32). The tour commander reports to the Chief of the Department (radio call sign: Car 30). Each platoon consists of: 1 Battalion Chief, 1 Captain, 4 Lieutenants and 15-16 Firefighters.\n\nAt full staffing the riding assignments tend to be the following: Car 32 is manned by the tour commander (Battalion Chief or Deputy Chief of Operations), Ladder 1 rides with 1 Captain or 1 Lieutenant & 5 firefighters. Engines 2, 3 & 4 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 3 Firefighters. The headquarters officer (Captain or Lieutenant) that does not ride the ladder truck is detailed as the Safety Officer for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour.\n\nAs of 11/15/2018 (the consolidation of Engine 1 with Ladder 1 and the closing of Rescue 1 due to the lack of hiring by the township), the minimum staffing has been: 1 Tour Commander, 3 Officers and 11 Firefighters. When this is in effect, Ladder 1 rides with the Headquarters Captain or Lieutenant & 3 firefighters, Engines 2 & 3 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 2 firefighters, and Engine 4 rides with 3 firefighters with 1 firefighter as an Acting Lieutenant for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour. \n\n=== Fire Prevention Bureau ===\nThe Fire Prevention Bureau is the enforcement agency for the Township's Fire Code, which is aimed at controlling fire hazards in all structures in the community. The Fire Code mandates periodic inspections, which includes inspections of schools, local businesses, factories, hospitals, nursing homes, all commercial businesses, industrial and office buildings in the community. All new construction, including renovations and additions, are inspected by a fire official before a certificate of occupancy is issued. The bureau consists of 3 Lieutenants (1 is the Fire Official) and 1 Clerk (Secretary). Fire Prevention is also assisted by the on duty platoon which performs some inspections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> These allow each shift to familiarize themselves with the various occupancies, types of buildings and uncommon building layouts within the township.\n\n=== Fire Training Bureau ===\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department, a recognized New Jersey Division of Fire Safety Eligible Organization, conducts thousands of man-hours of training every year. Many of the training courses delivered by the Training Bureau are courses and training materials that have been developed by the New Jersey Division of Fire Safety and the National Fire Academy. Other materials presented consisted of courses developed by the Federal Government or in house using resident subject-matter experts. Whether it is through classroom, presentations, hands-on, federal, state or regional sponsored training, below are some examples of training the department and it members constantly undertake.\n\nUniformed members of the department continuously attend education courses covering a broad variety of subjects, including but not limited to: building construction; foam operations; fire pump/apparatus pump operations; rapid intervention team (RIT) operations; tower ladder operations; aerial operations at night; emergency \"bailout\" evacuation devices and technique refresher; confined space operations; decontamination/warming truck operations; EVOC of fire apparatus, a formalized driving program; forcible entry/exit; cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (recertification); automatic external defibrillators (recertification); and first responder recertification. In addition, uniformed members attended classroom sessions on: SCBA breathing techniques/smoke inhalation; asbestos awareness; hazardous materials (refresher); specialized tool/equipment usage and care; incident management; cardiac emergencies; township workplace harassment training; and PEOSHA mandated annual training on workplace hazards.\n\nThe Fire Department ensures that its members are capable of addressing emerging threats that are appearing nationally and globally. Some classes members have participated in: Active Shooter, Bakken Fuel Emergencies, Hydrogen Cyanide in Fireground operations, MRI Safety in Fire Response, and proper utilization of Personal Radiation Detectors. The department also sends members to Responding to Terrorist Bombing Incidents at New Mexico Tech sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, Foam Firefighting School at Texas A&M TEEX, and the Security and Emergency Response Training Center in Boulder, Colo., for advanced training in dealing with Rail Emergencies.\n\n=== Fire Investigation Unit ===\nUnder the direction of the Chief of Department and the Fire Official the unit conducts investigations of all fires for origin and cause. In cases of arson, the unit coordinates with the [https://www.teanecknj.gov/Police-Department/ Teaneck Police Department], the [https://www.bcpo.net/ Bergen County Prosecutor's Office], the Bergen County Arson Squad and other State and Federal agencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> The Unit is on call and consists of: 1 Battalion Chief, 2 Lieutenants, and 5 Firefighters.\n\n=== Fire Alarm Bureau ===\nThe Township has 315 fire alarm boxes strategically located throughout the Township. The fire alarm boxes are used to report fires, pre fire smoke conditions and a variety of other incidents including medical emergencies, electrical accidents, steam leaks, etc.  The majority of boxes are dual use, relaying alarms from protected premises such as schools, places of public assembly, high rises, etc., as well as being available to bystanders to manually report fires and emergencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref>\n\n== Communications ==\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is dispatched out of Fire Headquarters at 1231 Teaneck Road. The Fire Department has two frequencies: the dispatch or \"main\" channel (158.82000&nbsp;MHz) and a fireground channel. (156.00000&nbsp;MHz)\n\n== Operations ==\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is 1 of only 3 fully career departments in Bergen County (Teaneck, Hackensack and Englewood) There are 3 other departments in Bergen County that use both career & volunteer members (combination): Bergenfield & [[Cresskill, New Jersey|Cresskill]] are mostly volunteer departments with a small contingent of career members, and [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]], which is mostly career with a small contingent of volunteer members\n\nAs of 2017, the department serves the second largest populous (\u224841,311), third most households (\u224814,024) and seventh largest area (6.226 square miles) in Bergen County. Furthermore, when requested they regularly respond on mutual aid to: Hackensack, Englewood, Bergenfield, Bogota, Ridgefield Park & [[New Milford, New Jersey|New Milford]]. The department responds 24 hours a day and works closely with the [https://www.teanecknj.gov/police-department Teaneck Police Department] & Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps to respond to approximately 3,200 to 4,200 calls per year involving mainly: structure fires, vehicle fires, electrical emergencies, natural gas releases, carbon monoxide incidents, explosions, rescues, outside fires, vehicle extrication's, waterborne rescue, forcing entry, service calls etc. Due to the ambulance corps abundant membership and active participation, the fire department typically does not respond on every EMS call. However, they are available to do so and frequently are on standby when the ambulance corps is dispatched. Instead the department responds: automatically on all severe calls (E.g. trauma, CPR etc.), when the ambulance corps requests them (E.g. forcible entry, calls on highways, lift assists etc.), or when the ambulance corps is unable to respond (E.g. holidays, weekends, overnights, multiple calls etc.).\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department operates out of 4 firehouses. There are 3 engines, 1 ladder truck, 3 spare engines, 1 spare ladder truck, along with various special and support units. A Battalion Chief is usually the daily tour commander and is in charge of all 4 stations.\n\nThe department has an authorized strength of 94 members: 1 Chief of Department, 2 Deputy Chiefs, 4 Battalion Chiefs, 5 Captains, (1 is the Training & Safety Officer) 19 Lieutenants (3 are Fire Prevention Officers) 61 Firefighters & 2 Clerks. (Secretaries, 1 is in Fire Prevention & 1 is Administrative)\n\nThe primary goal of the Teaneck Fire Department is to prevent fires from occurring. When a fire does occur the goal is to immediately protect life and property by promptly confining, controlling and extinguishing the fire while rescuing any trapped occupant. The average response time of the Teaneck Fire Department is three minutes from time of notification to arrival on the scene (below the recommended four minute response time).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref>\n\nMotor vehicle accidents occurs quite often in Teaneck due to the major highways ([[New Jersey Route 4|Rt. 4]], [[Interstate 95|Rt. 95]] & [[Interstate 80|Rt. 80]]) that are within the department's jurisdictions and main thoroughfares (Teaneck Rd, Queen Anne Rd, River Rd, Glenwood Ave, West Englewood Ave, West Forest Ave, Cedar Ln, Degraw Ave) that pass through and/or are in the town. The fire department regularly responds to motor vehicle accidents, with the [[New Jersey State Police]], [https://www.bcsd.us/ Bergen County Sheriffs Office] and/or Teaneck Police Department and the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps on the aforementioned highways, local thoroughfares and streets. Furthermore, Teaneck Fire Department responds to water rescues on the [[Hackensack River]], [[Overpeck Creek]] and to flooding conditions in Teaneck and neighboring towns upon request.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-11-02}}</ref>\n\n===== Call History 1929 - 1964 =====\n{{Graph:Chart|width=1200|height=170|xAxisTitle=Year|yAxisTitle=Fire Calls|legend=Data|type=line|x=29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64|y1=208,252,282,380,189,404,424,351,490,499,806,508,710,647,686,664,539,746,722,642,621,843,741,742,706,742,831,780,818,771,868,914,923,911,992,946,951|y2=199,243,274,341,170,387,403,0,0,0,0,414,520,394,471,429,331,0,530,403,416,472,446,492,399,402,440,403,358,410,484,224,448,441,459,444|y1Title=Runs|y2Title=Fires|colors=blue, red}}\n\n===== Call History 1965 - Present =====\n{{Graph:Chart|width=1200|height=250|xAxisTitle=Year|yAxisTitle=Fire Calls|legend=Data|type=line|x=65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,'00,'01,'02,'03,'04,'05,'06,'07,'08,'09,'10,'11,'12,'13,'14,'15,'16,'17,'18|y1=1044,960,1244,1080,1265,1390,1447,1339,1407,1387,1855,2044,1775,2055,2070,1724,2067,2198,2486,2307,2301,2403,2572,2691,2567,2612,2313,2611,2727,2929,3736,3483,3483,3801,3599,3811,3550,3643,3612,3733,3813,4217,3721,3593,3986,4227,3762,3297,3376,3247,3423,3127,3889,3429|y2=430,480,0,502,245,243,295,321,0,790,586,817,914,744,871,795,662,517,420,526,408,349,308,394,0,313,356,242,260,295,303,353,228,238,254,240,189,195,176,216,266,239,250,0,369,310,256,280,282,319,304,302,215,150,0|y1Title=Runs|y2Title=Fires|colors=blue, red}}\n\n<nowiki>**</nowiki>Fires statistic currently unavailable for: 1936, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1946, 1967, 1973, 1989 & 2008\n\n=== Assignments ===\n\nThe Township of Teaneck is geographically split into 4 distinct quadrants (districts); [[New Jersey Route 4|NJ State Route 4]] runs east/west and splits the township to a north-side & south-side, and the [[River Subdivision (CSX Transportation)|CSX River Subdivision Freight Line]] runs north\u2013south and splits the township to an east-side and west-side.

The TFD has 94 employees: 92 uniformed firefighters and 2 civilian employees. The department is directly responsible for over 41,000 residents living within the 6.23 square miles of Teaneck. Furthermore, The TFD routinely provides mutual aid to 6 surrounding communities in Bergen County (Boro of Bergenfield, Boro of Bogota, City of Englewood, City of Hackensack, Boro of New Milford and Village of Ridgefield Park), further assisting an additional 139,000 people over an additional 18.52 square miles.\n\n== History ==\nThe first known organized fire protection in Teaneck was provided by the Hackensack Township Protection Society, a part-paid, part-volunteer police organization which also provided organization and equipment for citizens to use in their own rudimentary fire defense. They responded to what is now Teaneck, but with long response times due to poor roads and steep hills. Into the 19th century, The Englewood Fire Department still responded into Teaneck, with similar response time problems.\n\nThe first organized fire company in Teaneck was Defender Hook & Ladder. They were formed on August 12, 1895 and quartered at 722 New Bridge Road, providing first due fire protection in the New Bridge section of Teaneck, lower New Milford and the Cherry Hill section of River Edge. This company did not join the other four independent Teaneck fire companies when the paid municipal fire department was organized in 1915. Instead, it helped supply the nucleus for New Milford Fire Company 2, although it continued to respond in Teaneck until 1933.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/History-2179/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>\n\n=== Formation ===\n\nThe question of forming Teaneck's first volunteer company was first considered in the summer of 1904 by the residents of Manhattan Heights and Selvage developments. Prior to the end of 1904, the residents officially formed the Upper Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association. They organized as Company #1 and were quartered at 1188 Teaneck Road. Organizers included Kenloch V. Ridley and Walter Kaltenback, the first paid chief of department and the first paid firefighter respectively when the department transitioned to a career (paid) department. Company #1 protected north of Cedar Lane to the Bergenfield, the sections of Teaneck known as Manhattan Heights, West Englewood Park and Upper Teaneck. They also responded as the second due engine in the remaining three districts. Company #1 was called upon to fight their first fire on December 8, 1904. On October 6, 1906 they held their first drill. Both of these would be first's in the history of The Teaneck Fire Department. In 1907 the company was forced to move to 18 Fairview Avenue but also obtained Teaneck's first motorized fire apparatus. The building at 18 Fairview Avenue was Fire Headquarters from 1915 until 1920\n\nTeaneck's second volunteer company was formed in 1908 by the residents of Bogota Park as the Cedar Volunteer Firemen's Association and organized Hose Company #2. From 1907 to 1913 they were located in a member's barn on Linden Avenue. Company #2 protected north to West Englewood Park, and west of the West Shore railroad to the Hackensack River. In 1912 a new station was constructed on Kenwood Place which remained Station 2 and housed Engine 2 until 1953.\n\nThe Lower Teaneck Volunteer Fireman's Association was the third Company was organized in October 1911 as Hose Company #1. They were quartered in a member's barn on the south end of Teaneck Road. They served the section of town known as Lower Teaneck. In 1914 the members rented a garage at 375 Queen Anne Road to store equipment and serve the expanding South Queen Anne Road business district. Shortly before World War I, in 1913 the Company acquired two building lots on Morningside Terrace, and in 1920 completed building their quarters on the lots. This was 395 Morningside Terrace which was Station 3 and housed Engine 3 from 1920 until 1990.\n\nThe Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen's Association, the 4th and final volunteer company, was organized in 1911 and quartered in a blacksmith shop at Glenwood Ave and Fabry Terrace until 1913. In 1913 they relocated to Glenwood Ave and Hemlock Terrace South. When Teaneck went to a career department in 1915, The Glenwood Park Volunteer Firemen retained their status as a complete volunteer company and responded to first alarm fires in their district and also to second alarm fires in all other parts of the Township. They remained active until 1948 when they were disbanded and its members went on to organize the [https://www.teaneckambulance.org/ Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps]\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 American LaFrance Type 75.jpg|1920 American LaFrance Type 75\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon.jpg|1920 Reo Speedwagon Hose Wagon\nFile:1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon.jpg|1920 Converted Reo Speedwagon Searchlight Wagon\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck.jpg|1923 Mack AC Aerial Ladder Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1926 American LaFrance Type 94 Converted Quadruple Truck.jpg|1926 American LaFrance Type 14 Converted Quadruple Truck\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1929 American LaFrance Type 145.jpg|1929 American LaFrance Type 145\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department 1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine.jpg|1931 Mack BJ Rescue Engine\nFile:Teaneck Fire Department Chiefs Car 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan.jpg|Chief of Department's 1931 Packard Standard Eight Sedan\n</gallery>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: none;\"\n|+Teaneck's Fire Chiefs<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.teaneck.org/virtualvillage/firedept/100th_Anniversary.html|title=Teaneck Public Library|website=www.teaneck.org|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n|-\n|Kenloch V.

Prior to them, \"banging\" locomotive rims were the primary means of alerting the department of a fire. In 1895, Locomotive rims were mounted on gallows with enameled signs. When there was a fire, residents would take a bent metal flat stock, go to the nearest \"gong\" and tap out the number, according to the number code on the sign. Other residents hearing the signal was then expected to repeat the signal at the gong nearest them. There were up to 46 gongs throughout the town, this lasted up until 1920.\n\n===== 1920 - 1948 =====\n\nIn 1920, residents began to dial the operator and ask for the Teaneck Fire Department to report a fire. The operator then transferred the call to the Teaneck Fire Department. The firefighter on the desk (deskman) would then ring the appropriate fire stations on a plug-type switchboard. This ring would set off World War I surplus air raid sirens at the fire stations. Members reporting to the stations to answer the alarm would pick up the phone. This would stop the siren and allow members to copy dispatch info onto a chalkboard. These lines were leased from New York Telephone.\n\nIn 1929, an extension from the Teaneck Police Department was connected to the Fire Department switchboard. There were 46 Police call boxes, painted red and left unlocked. Red and white rings were painted on the utility poles where the box was located. Also during the year, the Teaneck Chamber of Commerce began to push for a better fire alarm system. During 1932 the leased phone lines began to give problems to the TFD and a resident. Alarms rang a home phone on Penn Avenue and telephone calls to the same resident set off the air raid sirens at Station 2. The Teaneck Fire Department also produced new box number locations.\n\nIn 1933, the air raid siren at Fire Headquarters was replaced with an air horn. The air horn sounded the box numbers and special signals.\n\n1937 marked the introduction of the telegraph fire alarm boxes in Teaneck. 40 boxes were placed in service. Bells were installed in the fire houses.\n\nIn 1940, the air raid sirens were used only for air raid warnings and snow days. Phone lines to the stations became municipal. The telegraph box system was made up of 4 box circuits and 1 local circuit in headquarters which was connected to a 16\" gong.\n\n1940 through 1957 saw significant changes for communication with the implementation of voice radio. A two-way radio was installed in the Chief's car and Rescue 1. The radio frequency was 1630KC AM with an FCC Call Sign of KEE888. Radios were installed in the fire stations. Upon an alarm, two taps sounded on the Headquarters circuit and the box number was sounded on the station bells and over the air horns. Two announcements were made over the municipal voice lines to the stations. Each station had an amplifier and a speaker. There would be two tones then the announcement of the alarm over the radio.\n\nIn 1948, Teaneck Fire switched over to 33.8600&nbsp;MHz AM, with the same Call sign. Also, 1948 marked the introduction of Master Boxes to the Teaneck Telegraph Fire Alarm System. All schools, a car dealership, a chemical test facility, a bowling alley, a night club and two taxpayer buildings were the first the Master Box customers.\n\n===== 1957 - 1988 =====\n\nFrom 1957\u20131988, the number of circuits expanded to 16 box circuits and 2 alarm circuits. The use of the air horn was limited to General Alarms. The Teaneck Fire Department switched to 155.6100, sharing the frequency with the Police and DPW. By 1960 all apparatus had two-way radios. In 1968, the boxes were revised, splitting the town up into 6 zones rather than 4. In 1969, the Teaneck Fire Department split off and began operating on 158.8200. From 1970 - 1972, many street boxes were added, as well as numerous master boxes.\n\n===== 1988 - 1997 =====\nMunicipal voice lines to the stations and police were placed out of service. Box numbers were no longer sent out over the bells for telephone alarms of fire. Radios in the stations were replaced with tone-activated models. The two taps were no longer sent over the circuits.\n\nIn 1995, The Teaneck Fire Department added radio alarm boxes to the system.\n\nIn 1997, Municipal voice lines were reestablished to the stations and Police Headquarters. A voice line from Fire Headquarters to the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps was established. Dispatch procedures remained the same. The inside wire was used primarily for administrative messages, but sometimes used for dispatching during multiple alarms ongoing. 13 radio tie lines were also incorporated into the system. Also, a fireground frequency of 156.000&nbsp;MHz was established.\n\n===== 2003 - Present =====\nIn 2003, Computer communications (via T1 lines) was established to all stations (Police, DPW, TVAC, Recreation Department and Municipal Court). These lines were piggybacked on the fire alarm cables. Teaneck has the traditional telegraph boxes (both Gamewell and SAFA) and also has wireless radio boxes. Teaneck has about 33 radio boxes. Teaneck continues to add telegraph boxes to their system. The telegraph system gets quite a workout in Teaneck as it receives many box pulls for confirmed fires.\n\nTeaneck's 2002 Annual Township Managers Report states, \"Teaneck's municipal fire alarm system continued to be the best way to report fires, smoke and other emergencies to the Fire Department. In August 2002, Teaneck suffered a wide area failure of commercial telephone service when a severe lightning storm knocked out hundreds of phone lines in the northwest section of Teaneck. While the telephone company diligently sent a large force and immediately began repairs, many households lacked telephone service for up to four days.\" The report continued on saying \"In 2002, 91 fires and emergencies were reported via the fire alarm boxes. The instant alarm signals helped limit the damage and injuries in fires occurring at [Holy Name Hospital], [Glenpointe Marriott], a senior citizen apartment house (twice), a single family home, and other public and commercial occupancies. Dozens of smoke emergencies were signaled through the system, in some cases preventing smoldering materials or objects from reaching the stage of open flaming. In other cases, boxes were used to get help for hazardous conditions, leaks and rescue situations.....There were only 30 street malicious false alarms, less than 1% of Fire Department runs.\"\n\nTeaneck's 2003 Annual Township Managers Report states, \"...boxes were pulled 104 times, of which 18 were malicious false alarms.\"\n\nTeaneck's municipal fire alarm system is continuously maintained and cared for and is still active as of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.backtaps.com/activesystems.htm#Teaneck|title=Towns with Telegraph Fire Alarm Systems Still In Service|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Organization ==\nTeaneck Fire Department is a career fire department that has 92 uniformed members, out of a total of 94 authorized positions, including 31 officers and 61 firefighters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/Fire/|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=|first=|date=|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref> 83 uniformed members are assigned to 4 platoons (shifts) and 9 members are in the administrative, fire prevention and training bureaus.

The tour commander is in charge of the platoon on duty and is usually a Battalion Chief or on occasion the Deputy Chief of Operations (radio [[call sign]]: Car 32). The tour commander reports to the Chief of the Department (radio call sign: Car 30). Each platoon consists of: 1 Battalion Chief, 1 Captain, 4 Lieutenants and 15-16 Firefighters.\n\nAt full staffing the riding assignments tend to be the following: Car 32 is manned by the tour commander (Battalion Chief or Deputy Chief of Operations), Ladder 1 rides with 1 Captain or 1 Lieutenant & 5 firefighters. Engines 2, 3 & 4 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 3 Firefighters. The headquarters officer (Captain or Lieutenant) that does not ride the ladder truck is detailed as the Safety Officer for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour.\n\nAs of 11/15/2018 (the consolidation of Engine 1 with Ladder 1 and the closing of Rescue 1 due to the lack of hiring by the township), the minimum staffing has been: 1 Tour Commander, 3 Officers and 11 Firefighters. When this is in effect, Ladder 1 rides with the Headquarters Captain or Lieutenant & 3 firefighters, Engines 2 & 3 each ride with 1 Lieutenant & 2 firefighters, and Engine 4 rides with 3 firefighters with 1 firefighter as an Acting Lieutenant for the tour. 1 firefighter is assigned to desk duty and is the dispatcher for the tour. \n\n=== Fire Prevention Bureau ===\nThe Fire Prevention Bureau is the enforcement agency for the Township's Fire Code, which is aimed at controlling fire hazards in all structures in the community. The Fire Code mandates periodic inspections, which includes inspections of schools, local businesses, factories, hospitals, nursing homes, all commercial businesses, industrial and office buildings in the community. All new construction, including renovations and additions, are inspected by a fire official before a certificate of occupancy is issued. The bureau consists of 3 Lieutenants (1 is the Fire Official) and 1 Clerk (Secretary). Fire Prevention is also assisted by the on duty platoon which performs some inspections.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> These allow each shift to familiarize themselves with the various occupancies, types of buildings and uncommon building layouts within the township.\n\n=== Fire Training Bureau ===\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department, a recognized New Jersey Division of Fire Safety Eligible Organization, conducts thousands of man-hours of training every year. Many of the training courses delivered by the Training Bureau are courses and training materials that have been developed by the New Jersey Division of Fire Safety and the National Fire Academy. Other materials presented consisted of courses developed by the Federal Government or in house using resident subject-matter experts. Whether it is through classroom, presentations, hands-on, federal, state or regional sponsored training, below are some examples of training the department and it members constantly undertake.\n\nUniformed members of the department continuously attend education courses covering a broad variety of subjects, including but not limited to: building construction; foam operations; fire pump/apparatus pump operations; rapid intervention team (RIT) operations; tower ladder operations; aerial operations at night; emergency \"bailout\" evacuation devices and technique refresher; confined space operations; decontamination/warming truck operations; EVOC of fire apparatus, a formalized driving program; forcible entry/exit; cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (recertification); automatic external defibrillators (recertification); and first responder recertification. In addition, uniformed members attended classroom sessions on: SCBA breathing techniques/smoke inhalation; asbestos awareness; hazardous materials (refresher); specialized tool/equipment usage and care; incident management; cardiac emergencies; township workplace harassment training; and PEOSHA mandated annual training on workplace hazards.\n\nThe Fire Department ensures that its members are capable of addressing emerging threats that are appearing nationally and globally. Some classes members have participated in: Active Shooter, Bakken Fuel Emergencies, Hydrogen Cyanide in Fireground operations, MRI Safety in Fire Response, and proper utilization of Personal Radiation Detectors. The department also sends members to Responding to Terrorist Bombing Incidents at New Mexico Tech sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security, Foam Firefighting School at Texas A&M TEEX, and the Security and Emergency Response Training Center in Boulder, Colo., for advanced training in dealing with Rail Emergencies.\n\n=== Fire Investigation Unit ===\nUnder the direction of the Chief of Department and the Fire Official the unit conducts investigations of all fires for origin and cause. In cases of arson, the unit coordinates with the [https://www.teanecknj.gov/Police-Department/ Teaneck Police Department], the [https://www.bcpo.net/ Bergen County Prosecutor's Office], the Bergen County Arson Squad and other State and Federal agencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref> The Unit is on call and consists of: 1 Battalion Chief, 2 Lieutenants, and 5 Firefighters.\n\n=== Fire Alarm Bureau ===\nThe Township has 315 fire alarm boxes strategically located throughout the Township. The fire alarm boxes are used to report fires, pre fire smoke conditions and a variety of other incidents including medical emergencies, electrical accidents, steam leaks, etc.  The majority of boxes are dual use, relaying alarms from protected premises such as schools, places of public assembly, high rises, etc., as well as being available to bystanders to manually report fires and emergencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref>\n\n== Communications ==\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is dispatched out of Fire Headquarters at 1231 Teaneck Road. The Fire Department has two frequencies: the dispatch or \"main\" channel (158.82000&nbsp;MHz) and a fireground channel. (156.00000&nbsp;MHz)\n\n== Operations ==\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department is 1 of only 3 fully career departments in Bergen County (Teaneck, Hackensack and Englewood) There are 3 other departments in Bergen County that use both career & volunteer members (combination): Bergenfield & [[Cresskill, New Jersey|Cresskill]] are mostly volunteer departments with a small contingent of career members, and [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]], which is mostly career with a small contingent of volunteer members\n\nAs of 2017, the department serves the second largest populous (\u224841,311), third most households (\u224814,024) and seventh largest area (6.226 square miles) in Bergen County. Furthermore, when requested they regularly respond on mutual aid to: Hackensack, Englewood, Bergenfield, Bogota, Ridgefield Park & [[New Milford, New Jersey|New Milford]]. The department responds 24 hours a day and works closely with the [https://www.teanecknj.gov/police-department Teaneck Police Department] & Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps to respond to approximately 3,200 to 4,200 calls per year involving mainly: structure fires, vehicle fires, electrical emergencies, natural gas releases, carbon monoxide incidents, explosions, rescues, outside fires, vehicle extrication's, waterborne rescue, forcing entry, service calls etc. Due to the ambulance corps abundant membership and active participation, the fire department typically does not respond on every EMS call. However, they are available to do so and frequently are on standby when the ambulance corps is dispatched. Instead the department responds: automatically on all severe calls (E.g. trauma, CPR etc.), when the ambulance corps requests them (E.g. forcible entry, calls on highways, lift assists etc.), or when the ambulance corps is unable to respond (E.g. holidays, weekends, overnights, multiple calls etc.).\n\nThe Teaneck Fire Department operates out of 4 firehouses. There are 3 engines, 1 ladder truck, 3 spare engines, 1 spare ladder truck, along with various special and support units. A Battalion Chief is usually the daily tour commander and is in charge of all 4 stations.\n\nThe department has an authorized strength of 94 members: 1 Chief of Department, 2 Deputy Chiefs, 4 Battalion Chiefs, 5 Captains, (1 is the Training & Safety Officer) 19 Lieutenants (3 are Fire Prevention Officers) 61 Firefighters & 2 Clerks. (Secretaries, 1 is in Fire Prevention & 1 is Administrative)\n\nThe primary goal of the Teaneck Fire Department is to prevent fires from occurring. When a fire does occur the goal is to immediately protect life and property by promptly confining, controlling and extinguishing the fire while rescuing any trapped occupant. The average response time of the Teaneck Fire Department is three minutes from time of notification to arrival on the scene (below the recommended four minute response time).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teanecknj.gov/fire|title=Township of Teaneck New Jersey - Fire|last=www.evogov.com|website=www.teanecknj.gov|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref>\n\nMotor vehicle accidents occurs quite often in Teaneck due to the major highways ([[New Jersey Route 4|Rt. 4]], [[Interstate 95|Rt. 95]] & [[Interstate 80|Rt. 80]]) that are within the department's jurisdictions and main thoroughfares (Teaneck Rd, Queen Anne Rd, River Rd, Glenwood Ave, West Englewood Ave, West Forest Ave, Cedar Ln, Degraw Ave) that pass through and/or are in the town.

It is located {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}} southeast<ref name=\"AIP\" /> of Berlin near the town of [[Sch\u00f6nefeld]] in the state of [[Brandenburg]] and borders Berlin's southern boundary. It is the smaller of the two [[List of airports in Berlin|airports in Berlin]], after [[Berlin Tegel Airport]], and is a base for [[easyJet]] and [[Ryanair]]. In 2017 the airport handled 12.9 million passengers by serving mainly [[List of metropolitan areas in Europe|European metropolitan]] and [[leisure]] destinations.\n\nSch\u00f6nefeld Airport was the major civil airport of [[East Germany]] (GDR) and the only airport of the former [[East Berlin]]. Part of Sch\u00f6nefeld's existing infrastructure is set to be incorporated into the neighbouring [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]], scheduled to open in late 2020.<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-airport-berlin/berlins-new-airport-to-finally-open-in-october-2020-idUSL8N1OD27P Berlin's new airport to finally open in October 2020] - Reuters, 15 December 2017</ref> Sch\u00f6nefeld's then refurbished terminals are intended to be used until at least 2026 as part of the new airport.<ref name=\"upgradeplans\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DH 2 Bild-F-04180, Berlin-Sch\u00f6nefeld, Flughafenbau, Il14.jpg|thumb|Construction of [[Interflug]]'s new maintenance hangar in 1961]]\n[[File:Tupolev Tu-134A-3, CCCP-65783, Aeroflot.jpg|thumb|[[Eastern bloc]] airlines [[TAROM]], [[Aeroflot]], and [[Interflug]] in 1990]]\n\n===First years, World War II, and GDR period: 1934-1990===\nOn 15 October 1934 construction began to build three {{convert|800|m}} long runways to serve the [[Henschel & Son|Henschel]] aircraft plant in Sch\u00f6nefeld. By the end of the [[Second World War]], over 14,000 aircraft had been built. On 22 April 1945, the facilities were occupied by [[Red Army|Soviet troops]], and the plant was dismantled and demolished. By late 1947, the railway connection had been repaired and agricultural machinery was built and repaired on the site.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1946, the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved from [[Johannisthal Air Field]] to Sch\u00f6nefeld, including the civil airline [[Aeroflot]]. In 1947, the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]] approved the construction of a civilian airport at the site.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nA [[stipulation]] of the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four Power Agreement]] following World War II was a total ban on German carriers' participation in air transport to Berlin, where access was restricted to American, British, French, and Soviet airlines. Since Sch\u00f6nefeld airport was located outside the city boundaries of Berlin, this restriction did not apply. Thus, aircraft of the East German flag carrier [[Interflug]] could use Sch\u00f6nefeld airport, while West German [[Lufthansa]] was denied access to Tegel or [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof]] airports.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Development after German reunification: 1990-present===\nBerlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport has seen a major increase in passenger numbers over recent years, which was caused by the opening of bases for both [[easyJet]] and [[Germanwings]]. In 2008, the airport served 6.6 million passengers.\n\nFollowing [[German reunification]] in 1990, operating three separate airports became increasingly cost prohibitive, leading the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|Berlin legislature]] to pursue plans for a single airport that would be more efficient and would decrease the amount of [[aircraft noise]] from airports within the city. Therefore, it was decided to build [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] at the current site of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, originally scheduled to open in late 2012. For various reasons, mainly issues with the fire alarm/safety system, the opening has been postponed to 2019 or later.\n\nThe new airport will share only one runway with the existing one \u2013 the current runway will become the north runway of the new airport. Most of the old Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, including the [[airport terminal|terminal]] and [[airport ramp|apron]] areas, will undergo complete [[Urban renewal|urban redevelopment]] following its closure. Part of the old apron area will be used by the future new passenger terminal of the German government used for state visits and other state flight operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/hauptstadtflughafen/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-regierungsterminal-in-der-warteschleife,11546166,23722270.html |title=Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg: Regierungsterminal in der Warteschleife &#124; Hauptstadtflughafen \u2013 Berliner Zeitung |language=de |publisher=Berliner-zeitung.de }}</ref>\n\nAt the start of the winter season in 2012 [[Germanwings]] left Sch\u00f6nefeld for Berlin-Tegel to maintain closer operations within the [[Lufthansa Group]] there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/reise/aktuell/germanwings-zieht-von-flughafen-schoenefeld-nach-berlin-tegel-a-853854.html |title=Germanwings zieht nach Berlin-Tegel |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=4 September 2012}}</ref> However, to provide competition for Ryanair's new routes, Germanwings announced a return to Sch\u00f6nefeld in addition to their Tegel operations from October 2015.<ref name=\"4Ureturns\">{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/germanwings-konkurrenz-ryanair/35139|title=Germanwings stellt sich Konkurrenz durch Ryanair|work=airliners.de|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Aer Lingus]] also announced it would switch airports within Berlin, from Sch\u00f6nefeld to Tegel, by March 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ch-aviation.com/portal/news/35424-aer-lingus-to-switch-berlin-flights-from-schnefeld-to-tegel|title=Aer Lingus to switch Berlin flights from Sch\u00f6nefeld to Tegel|work=ch-aviation|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Ryanair]] announced the establishment of their sixth German base in Sch\u00f6nefeld by 27 October 2015 by deploying five aircraft to the airport and adding 16 new routes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/ryanair-basis-berlin/35089|title=Ryanair will mit Basis in Berlin Fluggastzahlen deutlich steigern|work=airliners.de|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn 2 May 2015, aircraft departing from Sch\u00f6nefeld became the first commercial flights to use the southern runway of the new [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]], which temporarily became Sch\u00f6nefeld's only runway while its own, which will become the northern runway of the new airport, was renovated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.de/news-21622/BER-Erste-Flieger-starten-auf-suedlicher-Bahn.html|title=aero.de - Luftfahrt-Nachrichten und -Community|work=aero.de|accessdate=4 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nExtension work at Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport was completed in 2016.

There are some shops, however, including duty-free, newsstands, a few [[fast food]] restaurants, and a single airline lounge. As of April 2020, the four terminals A, B, C, D were given new names K, L, M, Q in order to avoid duplicate names of terminal sections of the new Berlin-Brandenburg Airport.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berlin-airport.de/en/company/latest-news/news/2020/2020-03-02-aus-abcd-wird-klmq/index.php|title=ABCD becomes KLMQ|website=Berlin Brandenburg Airport|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n===Terminal L===\nThe main building is the original part of the airport.

Terminal L features check-in counters L01\u2013L18, with the largest user being [[Ryanair]] alongside several other airlines like [[Aeroflot]].\n\n===Terminal K===\nTerminal K, located in a side wing, was originally reserved for transit passengers to and from West Berlin who took advantage of cheaper air fares and package tours arranged by an East German travel agency. Nowadays, it is used exclusively by [[EasyJet]] with check-in counters K20\u2013K29 and has been refurbished in recent years. The airside consists of three [[jet bridge]]s as well as several walk-boarding aircraft stands located at ''Pier 3a'', an extension that was opened in 2005. Pier 3a was under extensive reconstruction until mid-2019 to allow use as part of the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport.<ref name=\"upgradeplans\"/>\n\n===Terminal Q===\nTerminal Q was originally built in the early 1980s as an external [[Airport lounge|VIP lounge]] called \"Sonderraum\" (Special Room), and was tightly secured by the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] (Stasi).  Admitted were only official guests of the East German government and its subordinated organizations.  Check-in and all mandatory controls were either waived or done invisibly for travelers.  After 1990, the Special Room was converted into Terminal Q to accommodate highly security-sensitive flights like those of Israeli airlines, but also for charter flights to North America. It was reconfigured in 2008 to handle sightseeing trips and flights in connection with special events.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.air-service-berlin.de/index.php5?page=306-0-0-0-1-1-2&lang=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705112226/http://www.air-service-berlin.de/index.php5?page=306-0-0-0-1-1-2&lang=2|url-status=dead|title=Event and Show Terminal C|archivedate=5 July 2011|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref> It was further reconfigured in 2015 to provide access to all terminal gates.

By the end of the [[Second World War]], over 14,000 aircraft had been built. On 22 April 1945, the facilities were occupied by [[Red Army|Soviet troops]], and the plant was dismantled and demolished. By late 1947, the railway connection had been repaired and agricultural machinery was built and repaired on the site.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn 1946, the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved from [[Johannisthal Air Field]] to Sch\u00f6nefeld, including the civil airline [[Aeroflot]]. In 1947, the [[Soviet Military Administration in Germany]] approved the construction of a civilian airport at the site.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nA [[stipulation]] of the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin|Four Power Agreement]] following World War II was a total ban on German carriers' participation in air transport to Berlin, where access was restricted to American, British, French, and Soviet airlines. Since Sch\u00f6nefeld airport was located outside the city boundaries of Berlin, this restriction did not apply. Thus, aircraft of the East German flag carrier [[Interflug]] could use Sch\u00f6nefeld airport, while West German [[Lufthansa]] was denied access to Tegel or [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof]] airports.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Development after German reunification: 1990-present===\nBerlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport has seen a major increase in passenger numbers over recent years, which was caused by the opening of bases for both [[easyJet]] and [[Germanwings]]. In 2008, the airport served 6.6 million passengers.\n\nFollowing [[German reunification]] in 1990, operating three separate airports became increasingly cost prohibitive, leading the [[Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin|Berlin legislature]] to pursue plans for a single airport that would be more efficient and would decrease the amount of [[aircraft noise]] from airports within the city. Therefore, it was decided to build [[Berlin Brandenburg Airport]] at the current site of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, originally scheduled to open in late 2012. For various reasons, mainly issues with the fire alarm/safety system, the opening has been postponed to 2019 or later.\n\nThe new airport will share only one runway with the existing one \u2013 the current runway will become the north runway of the new airport. Most of the old Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, including the [[airport terminal|terminal]] and [[airport ramp|apron]] areas, will undergo complete [[Urban renewal|urban redevelopment]] following its closure.

Terminal C has no check-in facilities, it is used exclusively for passengers clearing security checks to enter the airside boarding gates. Due to a lack of space, there are not as many facilities as those at many other international airports. There are some shops, however, including duty-free, newsstands, a few [[fast food]] restaurants, and a single airline lounge.\n\n===Terminal A===\nThe main building is the original part of the airport. It houses check-in for Terminals A and B. Terminal A features check-in counters A01\u2013A18, with the largest user being [[Ryanair]] alongside several other airlines like [[Aeroflot]].\n\n===Terminal B===\nTerminal B, located in a side wing, was originally reserved for transit passengers to and from West Berlin who took advantage of cheaper air fares and package tours arranged by an East German travel agency. Nowadays, it is used exclusively by [[EasyJet]] with check-in counters B20\u2013B29 and has been refurbished in recent years. The airside consists of three [[jet bridge]]s as well as several walk-boarding aircraft stands located at ''Pier 3a'', an extension that was opened in 2005. Pier 3a is under extensive reconstruction until mid-2019 to allow use as part of the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport.<ref name=\"upgradeplans\"/>\n\n===Terminal C===\nTerminal C was originally built in the early 1980s as an external [[Airport lounge|VIP lounge]] called \"Sonderraum\" (Special Room), and was tightly secured by the [[Stasi|Ministry for State Security]] (Stasi).  Admitted were only official guests of the East German government and its subordinated organizations.  Check-in and all mandatory controls were either waived or done invisibly for travelers.  After 1990, the Special Room was converted into Terminal C to accommodate highly security-sensitive flights like those of Israeli airlines, but also for charter flights to North America. It was reconfigured in 2008 to handle sightseeing trips and flights in connection with special events.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.air-service-berlin.de/index.php5?page=306-0-0-0-1-1-2&lang=2|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705112226/http://www.air-service-berlin.de/index.php5?page=306-0-0-0-1-1-2&lang=2|url-status=dead|title=Event and Show Terminal C|archivedate=5 July 2011|accessdate=15 February 2019}}</ref> It was further reconfigured in 2015 to provide access to all terminal gates.

Being nearly identical to Terminal C at [[Berlin Tegel Airport]], it features check-in counters D40\u2013D57, which are mainly used by [[Ryanair]], [[Condor Flugdienst|Condor]], and [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]]. It does not feature jet bridges but several walk-boarding stands.

He abandoned his drug business and became deeply [[religious]], attending the [[Hajj]] in 2002 and 2003. There was peace between the families.\n\n===The shooting of Khaled Taleb: 30 July 2003===\n\nThe feud was reignited more than 2 years after the [[kneecapping]] of Bilal Razzak.\n\nTaleb, who had been Adnan Darwiche's right-hand man in his former drug business, was shot by 2 masked men as he spoke to a friend in the Halal's Butcher shop in [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]]. He was shot in both legs. Taleb believed that the gunmen were Gehad and Ziad Razzak, although nobody was ever charged in relation to the shooting.\n\nAccording to Taleb, Adnan Darwiche said that if the Razzaks were responsible then ''\"they're gunna cop it, they're dead...this is it I'm either gunna die or spend the rest of my life in gaol, it's on\"'' and ''\"this was it the Razzak's and they were all dead\"''.\n\n===The Yanderra Street shooting: 27 August 2003===\n\nAdnan Darwiche concluded that the Razzaks were responsible. According to Taleb, on 25 August 2003 Adnan and Abdul Darwiche, Touma and Aouad visited him and told him they had discovered that Gehad and Ziad Razzak were living at Yanderra Street, Condell Park. Adnan Darwiche said ''\"this is what's gunna happen. Fidel can drive down the road and shoot at their house, then they come out to see what the fuck happened, me and Abdul will be standing on the corner with SKS's and blast em\"''.\n\nOn the evening of 27 August 2003 Adnan Darwiche and another man (suspected to be Abdul Darwiche, although he was later acquitted) took up positions near the Yanderra Street house. They were both armed with [[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifle]]s. A third man (suspected to be Aouad, although he was never charged) drove to the house and fired 11 shots at a car parked outside the house.\n\nFarouk Razzak came out of the house to investigate. He saw \"like some shadow go towards the right, under the dark, the trees...suddenly I see two different persons. Since I saw them I yell to them, I swear to them 'Hey boy, what you fucking' \u2013 and then the fire come out of the gun, they not let me finish my words...and I turn back and I walk just normal.

The handle come off in my hand, and I feel burn\".\n\nThe gunmen fired 55 rounds, but Farouk Razzak was not hit. Nor were the other occupants of the house, his wife Nahla, son Mohamad and daughter Jomana. The gunmen were so inaccurate that shots hit houses as far east as no. 96 (five houses down the street). Farouk yelled to Nahla \"Listen, that pigs, Abdul and Eddie, they shot me\".<ref name=\"2006 NSWSC 848\">{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|848|2006|litigants=R v Abdul Darwiche |date=8 March 2006 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to Taleb, Darwiche said after the shooting ''\"Ziggy came out on the porch and then Frank came out. Ziggy had a gun and was looking around. Me and Abdul blasted em, fuckin missed.\"'' and ''\"Fuck them. Fuck all of them.\"''\n\n===The murder of Ali Abdul Razzak: 29 August 2003===\n\nAccording to Jamal Razzak he was assaulted by Adnan and Abdul Darwiche and another man in Greenacre at 11:30am. He alleged that Abdul Darwiche pointed an assault style rifle at him through the passenger window of a vehicle. No charges were ever laid in relation to this alleged incident.\n\nAt 1:23pm Ali Abdul Razzak was shot and killed while seated in his car which was parked near the Lakemba Mosque. Witnesses observed a small black hatchback vehicle which stopped in front of Razzak's vehicle. The driver and passenger of the black hatchback were wearing balaclavas. The passenger got out of the car, holding a black pistol. He fired shots at Razzak and got back into the passenger seat of the vehicle, which drove off. 14 fired cartridge cases were found at the scene.\n\nAccording to Taleb, he was visited at his sister's house at about 2:00pm by Adnan Darwiche, Gary Awad and Touma. Darwiche said ''\"I waited, when he got in the car I unloaded a magazine on him, I saw one bullet hit him just above the eyebrow. I saw him take his last breath.\"'' and gave Taleb a.40 calibre Glock pistol to get rid of.\n\nDarwiche was later acquitted of Razzak's murder and nobody else has ever been charged.\n\nOn 30 August 2003 55 shots were fired at Aouad's family home in Liverpool and 65 shots fired at Taleb's house in Liverpool. According to Taleb, Aouad said to him a few days later ''\"I know it was that cunt Hussein'' [Fahda]'', Gehad, Ziggy and Mohammed for sure there's no doubt about it. They're going to cop it, they're gunna cop it, they're fuckin' dead, my parents nearly got hit.\"''\n\n===Stolen weapons: September/October 2003===\n\nMeanwhile, 31 Glock pistols were stolen from Obliging Security in Chester Hill.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/04/1062548951407.html?from=storyrhs|title=Robbers steal 34 guns from Obliging Security|date=2003-09-04|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2009-04-19}}</ref> (One of those weapons would later be found at the scene of a shootout involving El-Zeyat and Aouad.)\n\nZiad and Gehad Razzak went into hiding and stayed with a friend, Ali Hamka, who lived at 5 Lawford Street, Greenacre.

According to Taleb, he accompanied Darwiche on a drive past the house. A man later given the pseudonym \"Mr W\" testified that Osman drove him past the house, saying ''\"Just drive past, I don't want the Razzaks to recognize the car or me.

He said ''\"I will see you at Erdt's at two o'clock in the morning. At three o'clock there are going to be fireworks.\"''\n\nAccording to Taleb, a Nissan Pulsar was stolen and driven to El-Zeyat's house. Present were Adnan Darwiche, Taleb, El-Zeyat, Aouad, Osman Darwiche and Awad. There was a discussion about whether or not to use the rocket launcher in the assault. Osman told Adnan ''\"you can't just use that because like you are meant to put them things on your ears to block your ears. You cannot use it if you were to use it like that. It will blow your eardrums out.\"'' It was decided not to use the rocket launcher. Adnan outlined each man's role: Taleb was to have been the driver, but it was considered that due to his injuries, he would become a liability if there was trouble. Osman was assigned the role of driver. Adnan and Touma were to use the [[SKS]] rifles, Aouad was to use a [[Mac 10]]. El-Zeyat insisted that he wanted to be one of the shooters too, and he was drafted into the plans and assigned a Glock. Adnan instructed that the shooters should fire on the house in an \"S\" shape in case the occupants of the house dropped to the floor.\n\nAt 3:00am Osman dropped the other men off near Lawford Street.

According to Taleb, on 25 August 2003 Adnan and Abdul Darwiche, Touma and Aouad visited him and told him they had discovered that Gehad and Ziad Razzak were living at Yanderra Street, Condell Park. Adnan Darwiche said ''\"this is what's gunna happen. Fidel can drive down the road and shoot at their house, then they come out to see what the fuck happened, me and Abdul will be standing on the corner with SKS's and blast em\"''.\n\nOn the evening of 27 August 2003 Adnan Darwiche and another man (suspected to be Abdul Darwiche, although he was later acquitted) took up positions near the Yanderra Street house. They were both armed with [[SKS]] [[semi-automatic rifle]]s. A third man (suspected to be Aouad, although he was never charged) drove to the house and fired 11 shots at a car parked outside the house.\n\nFarouk Razzak came out of the house to investigate. He saw \"like some shadow go towards the right, under the dark, the trees...suddenly I see two different persons. Since I saw them I yell to them, I swear to them 'Hey boy, what you fucking' \u2013 and then the fire come out of the gun, they not let me finish my words...and I turn back and I walk just normal. I didn't run. I walk normal until I get the screen door, the screen door lock by itself. I put the handle and the bullets, I think it must miss my eyes maybe one millimetre and, my head, my everywhere. They stop me. I think second on the door, I can't move. The handle come off in my hand, and I feel burn\".\n\nThe gunmen fired 55 rounds, but Farouk Razzak was not hit. Nor were the other occupants of the house, his wife Nahla, son Mohamad and daughter Jomana. The gunmen were so inaccurate that shots hit houses as far east as no. 96 (five houses down the street). Farouk yelled to Nahla \"Listen, that pigs, Abdul and Eddie, they shot me\".<ref name=\"2006 NSWSC 848\">{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|848|2006|litigants=R v Abdul Darwiche |date=8 March 2006 |courtname=auto}}.</ref>\n\nAccording to Taleb, Darwiche said after the shooting ''\"Ziggy came out on the porch and then Frank came out. Ziggy had a gun and was looking around. Me and Abdul blasted em, fuckin missed.\"'' and ''\"Fuck them. Fuck all of them.\"''\n\n===The murder of Ali Abdul Razzak: 29 August 2003===\n\nAccording to Jamal Razzak he was assaulted by Adnan and Abdul Darwiche and another man in Greenacre at 11:30am. He alleged that Abdul Darwiche pointed an assault style rifle at him through the passenger window of a vehicle. No charges were ever laid in relation to this alleged incident.\n\nAt 1:23pm Ali Abdul Razzak was shot and killed while seated in his car which was parked near the Lakemba Mosque. Witnesses observed a small black hatchback vehicle which stopped in front of Razzak's vehicle. The driver and passenger of the black hatchback were wearing balaclavas. The passenger got out of the car, holding a black pistol. He fired shots at Razzak and got back into the passenger seat of the vehicle, which drove off. 14 fired cartridge cases were found at the scene.\n\nAccording to Taleb, he was visited at his sister's house at about 2:00pm by Adnan Darwiche, Gary Awad and Touma. Darwiche said ''\"I waited, when he got in the car I unloaded a magazine on him, I saw one bullet hit him just above the eyebrow. I saw him take his last breath.\"'' and gave Taleb a.40 calibre Glock pistol to get rid of.\n\nDarwiche was later acquitted of Razzak's murder and nobody else has ever been charged.\n\nOn 30 August 2003 55 shots were fired at Aouad's family home in Liverpool and 65 shots fired at Taleb's house in Liverpool. According to Taleb, Aouad said to him a few days later ''\"I know it was that cunt Hussein'' [Fahda]'', Gehad, Ziggy and Mohammed for sure there's no doubt about it. They're going to cop it, they're gunna cop it, they're fuckin' dead, my parents nearly got hit.\"''\n\n===Stolen weapons: September/October 2003===\n\nMeanwhile, 31 Glock pistols were stolen from Obliging Security in Chester Hill.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/09/04/1062548951407.html?from=storyrhs|title=Robbers steal 34 guns from Obliging Security|date=2003-09-04|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2009-04-19}}</ref> (One of those weapons would later be found at the scene of a shootout involving El-Zeyat and Aouad.)\n\nZiad and Gehad Razzak went into hiding and stayed with a friend, Ali Hamka, who lived at 5 Lawford Street, Greenacre. Hamka's partner, Mervat Nemra, and their 2 young children went to stay with relatives.\n\nOn 30 September 2003 Adnan Darwiche allegedly purchased a rocket launcher from Taha Abdul Rahman for $15,000 and on 9 October 2003 allegedly purchased a further 6 rocket launchers from Rahman, on-selling 5 of them to Mohammad Ali Elomar, who was allegedly involved in a plot to blow up parliament house and/or the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights, saying ''\"Look what is happening overseas.

According to Taleb, he accompanied Darwiche on a drive past the house.

He said ''\"I will see you at Erdt's at two o'clock in the morning. At three o'clock there are going to be fireworks.\"''\n\nAccording to Taleb, a Nissan Pulsar was stolen and driven to El-Zeyat's house. Present were Adnan Darwiche, Taleb, El-Zeyat, Aouad, Osman Darwiche and Awad. There was a discussion about whether or not to use the rocket launcher in the assault. Osman told Adnan ''\"you can't just use that because like you are meant to put them things on your ears to block your ears. You cannot use it if you were to use it like that. It will blow your eardrums out.\"'' It was decided not to use the rocket launcher. Adnan outlined each man's role: Taleb was to have been the driver, but it was considered that due to his injuries, he would become a liability if there was trouble. Osman was assigned the role of driver. Adnan and Touma were to use the [[SKS]] rifles, Aouad was to use a [[Mac 10]]. El-Zeyat insisted that he wanted to be one of the shooters too, and he was drafted into the plans and assigned a Glock. Adnan instructed that the shooters should fire on the house in an \"S\" shape in case the occupants of the house dropped to the floor.\n\nAt 3:00am Osman dropped the other men off near Lawford Street.

Four months later, they have seemingly come to terms with what happened, but the others are not convinced. While recovering Nora's discarded suit at the junkyard, Iris is nearly sucked into a black hole. Her investigation into what caused it leads her to [[Chester P. Runk (Arrowverse)|Chester P. Runk]], who built a machine to open black holes only to end up catatonic after half of his consciousness was absorbed into it. Even worse, the black hole opens over Central City; much larger than before. Using tech from Nora's back-up gauntlet, Barry dives into the black hole, retrieves Chester's consciousness, and puts it back into him; restoring him and closing the black hole. Meanwhile, [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin]] helps Frost learn how to live her own life and tries to dissuade her colleague [[Ramsey Rosso (Arrowverse)|Ramsey Rosso]] from using dark matter to cure his patients. Rosso ignores Caitlin's warnings and tests his cure on himself, only to exhibit metahuman powers.

Using a machine Jay built, they send Barry's mind through the anti-matter wall, causing him to see billions of timelines where the multiverse is destroyed and the one where he dies saving it.

In response, Barry decides to train Cisco to become the new leader of Team Flash after he's gone by working with him to save Rosso. Nash appears and offers his assistance in exchange for a \"crypto-circuit\" he claims only Cisco can build. The three raid McCulloch Technologies for a regenerating serum, though Cisco pockets it to save Barry instead and claims it was sold off. Barry later finds out and they have a falling out. Barry gives the serum to Rosso, hoping it'll save him, but it does not work; causing Rosso to realize he needs blood flooded with adrenaline to save himself.

Upon further investigation, Cisco discovers Echo is actually his Earth-19 doppelg\u00e4nger, who used their shared face to frame his Earth-1 counterpart. After a confrontation, Cisco manages to trap Echo so the Collectors can arrest him.

Using a combination of Rosso's blood, the particle accelerator, and Allegra's powers, Team Flash subvert Rosso's plan to cure Central City of his influence. With his plan foiled, Rosso transforms into a blood monster to kill the Flash and begin anew, only to be distracted by a hallucination of his mother long enough for the speedster to trap him in Chester's prison.

Four months later, they have seemingly come to terms with what happened, but the others are not convinced. While recovering Nora's discarded suit at the junkyard, Iris is nearly sucked into a black hole. Her investigation into what caused it leads her to [[Chester P. Runk (Arrowverse)|Chester P. Runk]], who built a machine to open black holes only to end up catatonic after half of his consciousness was absorbed into it. Even worse, the black hole opens over Central City; much larger than before. Using tech from Nora's back-up gauntlet, Barry dives into the black hole, retrieves Chester's consciousness, and puts it back into him; restoring him and closing the black hole. Meanwhile, [[Caitlin Snow (Arrowverse)|Caitlin]] helps Frost learn how to live her own life and tries to dissuade her colleague [[Ramsey Rosso (Arrowverse)|Ramsey Rosso]] from using dark matter to cure his patients. Rosso ignores Caitlin's warnings and tests his cure on himself, only to exhibit metahuman powers. Elsewhere, Barry and Iris learn that the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] destroyed Nora's message to discourage Barry from changing his fate during the impending [[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis]]; telling him the Flash must die so billions can live.\n |LineColor       = 3D1A24\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Flash (season 6)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 116\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n |Title           = A Flash of the Lightning\n |DirectedBy      = Chris Peppe\n |WrittenBy       = Sam Chalsen & Jeff Hersh\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|15}}\n |ProdCode        = T27.14002\n |Viewers         = 1.27<ref name=\"6.02\">{{Cite web |url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tuesday-final-ratings-oct-15-2019/ |title='Mixed-ish' adjusts down: Tuesday final ratings |last=Welch |first=Alex |date=October 16, 2019 |website=[[TV by the Numbers]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023062424/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tuesday-final-ratings-oct-15-2019/ |archive-date=October 23, 2019 |access-date=October 16, 2019}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Refusing to give up hope, Barry decides to time travel to the day after he disappeared to find out what really happens during the Crisis.

Using a machine Jay built, they send Barry's mind through the anti-matter wall, causing him to see billions of timelines where the multiverse is destroyed and the one where he dies saving it. The experience leaves him unsure of what to do, though Joe later reassures him his death is not a sign that he gave up. Meanwhile, Cecile takes on a case involving young meta, [[Allegra Garcia (Arrowverse)|Allegra Garcia]]. Her powers tell her she is innocent, so she asks she be released. However, Allegra turns up at a crime scene having seemingly killed someone. Even in spite of Joe telling her how her job works, Cecile still believes Allegra's innocent.

In response, Barry decides to train Cisco to become the new leader of Team Flash after he's gone by working with him to save Rosso.

The three raid McCulloch Technologies for a regenerating serum, though Cisco pockets it to save Barry instead and claims it was sold off. Barry later finds out and they have a falling out.

Upon further investigation, Cisco discovers Echo is actually his Earth-19 doppelg\u00e4nger, who used their shared face to frame his Earth-1 counterpart.

Kamilla and Chester provide assistance as the rest of Team Flash is busy, but Rathaway escapes. While updating Gideon, Barry accidentally ends up in Grodd's mind while the latter is still in his neural inhibitor-induced coma. Grodd tells Barry that because of the Crisis, he wanted to make amends for what he has done and return to [[Gorilla City]] to live in peace. Barry does not believe him, but when he tries to escape, he is stopped by the \"gatekeeper\", [[Solovar (Arrowverse)|Solovar]]. After Barry reconciles with Grodd, they work together to defeat Solovar while Chester helps separate their minds. Following this, A.R.G.U.S. arranges for Grodd to be released on probation. Meanwhile, Iris and Eva make another attempt to escape the mirror dimension, but the latter burns her arms. When Iris leaves to get bandages, Eva contacts mirror Iris, who suffered the same injuries while working for her before Eva heals them.

When Nash tries to explain himself, he hallucinates another doppelg\u00e4nger of his, [[Harrison Wells#Sherloque Wells|Sherloque Wells]], warning him that \"he is coming\".\n |LineColor       = 3D1A24\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Flash (season 6)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 128\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 14\n |Title           = Death of the Speed Force\n |DirectedBy      = Brent Crowell\n |WrittenBy       = Sam Chalsen & Emily Palizzi\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|10}}\n |ProdCode        = T27.14014\n |Viewers         = 1.03<ref name=\"6.14\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-tuesday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-10-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Tuesday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.10.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 11, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 11, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]] and Cisco return to Central City, with the former confronting Barry over Oliver enhancing his speed during the Crisis{{efn|name=\"Crisis\"}}.

Meanwhile, Frida Novikov, a metahuman who can manipulate time, attempts to exact revenge against those who ruined a past crime spree she committed. Dubbing her \"[[Turtle (comics)|Turtle]] II\", Cisco develops Velocity-X to negate her powers, and with help from Flash and Kid Flash, Joe eventually manages to arrest her. Following this, Cisco is attacked by [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Eobard Thawne]], who took possession of Nash's body, but cannot access his speed as his host does not have powers. Cecile incapacitates him, allowing Team Flash to imprison him in the pipeline. After Thawne reveals that he still has access to the Negative Speed Force, Barry gets the idea to create an artificial Speed Force to save himself.

With this knowledge, they help Nash come to terms with her death and expel Thawne. Meanwhile, Eva sends Mirror Iris and Mirror Kamilla to steal a Prismatic Refractor from Mercury Labs, only to find Black Hole operative, \"Sunshine\", has beaten them to it. They call in Frost and Flash, but despite using Velocity-X, Flash's speed falters and Frost is nearly killed, though CCPD intervene and force Sunshine to escape. After \"Iris\" reminds him of the idea of limits, Barry works with CCPD to trap Sunshine in his lab with the windows shuttered, blocking her powers. While arresting Sunshine, Singh suspects she was the mole because of her powers.
