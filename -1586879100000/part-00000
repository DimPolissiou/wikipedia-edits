Some cabinets stand alone while others are built in to a wall or are attached to it like a [[Bathroom cabinet|medicine cabinet]]. Cabinets are typically made of wood (solid or with [[Wood veneer|veneer]]s or artificial surfaces), coated [[steel]] (common for medicine cabinets), or synthetic materials. [[Commerce|Commercial]] grade cabinets, which differ in the materials used, are called '''casework''', '''casegoods''', or '''case furniture'''.\n\nCabinets usually have one or more doors on the front, which are mounted with [[Door furniture|door hardware]], and occasionally a [[Lock (security device)|lock]]. Cabinets may have one or more doors, [[Drawer (furniture)|drawer]]s, and/or [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]. Short cabinets often have a finished surface on top that can be used for display, or as a working surface, such as the [[countertop]]s found in kitchens.\n\nA cabinet intended to be used in a bedroom and with several drawers typically placed one above another in one or more columns intended for clothing and small articles is called a [[chest of drawers]]. A small bedside cabinet is more frequently called a [[nightstand|nightstand or night table]]. A tall cabinet intended for clothing storage including hanging of clothes is called a ''[[wardrobe]]'' or an ''armoire'', or (in some countries) a ''closet'' if built-in.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:CommodeBoulle.jpg|369px|thumb|center|Commode by [[Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]]]]\nBefore the advent of [[industrial design]], cabinet makers were responsible for the conception and the production of any piece of furniture. In the last half of the 18th century, cabinet makers, such as [[Thomas Sheraton]], [[Thomas Chippendale]], Shaver and Wormley Bros. Cabinet Constructors, and [[George Hepplewhite]], also published books of furniture forms. These books were compendiums of their designs and those of other '''cabinet makers'''.  The most famous cabinetmaker before the advent of industrial design is probably [[Andr\u00e9-Charles Boulle]] (11 November 1642 \u2013 29 February 1732) and his legacy is known as \"[[Boulle Work]]\" and the [[\u00c9cole Boulle]], a college of fine [[arts and crafts]] and [[applied arts]] in Paris, today bears testimony to his Art.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Boulle, Andr\u00e9 Charles |volume=4 |pages=321-323 |first=James |last=Penderel-Brodhurst}}</ref>\n[[File:Tortoiseshell cabinet Sobieski.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tortoiseshell material|Tortoise-shell]] [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] of Polish king [[John III Sobieski]], [[Looting|looted]] by the Germans from the [[Wilan\u00f3w Palace]] during [[World War II]]<ref>{{cite web  |author = Monika Kuhnke |url = |title = Cenny dar dla zwyci\u0119zcy spod Wiednia |work = icons.pl |publisher = valuable, priceless, lost |pages =  |page =  |year = 2000 |language=pl}}</ref>]]\nWith the [[industrial revolution]] and the application of [[Watt steam engine|steam]] power to cabinet making tools, [[mass production]] techniques were gradually applied to nearly all aspects of cabinet making, and the traditional cabinet shop ceased to be the main source of furniture, domestic or commercial. In parallel to this evolution there came a growing demand by the rising [[middle class]] in most industrialised countries for finely made furniture. This eventually resulted in a growth in the total number of traditional cabinet makers.\n\nBefore 1650, fine furniture was a rarity in Western Europe and North America. Generally, people did not need it and for the most part could not afford it. They made do with simple but serviceable pieces.\n\nThe [[arts and craft movement]] which started in the [[United Kingdom]] in the middle of the 19th century spurred a market for traditional cabinet making, and other [[craft]] goods. It rapidly spread to the [[United States]] and to all the countries in the [[British Empire]]. This movement exemplified the reaction to the eclectic historicism of the [[Victorian era]] and to the 'soulless' machine-made production which was starting to become widespread. During this time, cabinetry was said to be one of the most noble and admirable skills by nearly one fourth of the population of the United Kingdom, and 31% of those who believed this strived for their children to learn the art of cabinetry.\n\nAfter [[World War II]] woodworking became a popular [[hobby]] among the middle classes. The more serious and skilled amateurs in this field now turn out pieces of furniture which rival the work of professional cabinet makers. Together, their work now represents but a small percentage of furniture production in any industrial country, but their numbers are vastly greater than those of their counterparts in the 18th century and before.\n\n== Schools of design ==\n[[File:Hughes Sambin - Cabinet - Walters 652.jpg|thumb|right|Crafted by Hughes Sambin (1570-1600), double cabinet features the combination of architectural elements and relief carving that is characteristic of French furniture of the period.]]\n\n=== Scandinavian ===\nThis style of design is typified by clean horizontal and vertical lines. Compared to other designs there is a distinct absence of ornamentation.  While [[Scandinavian design]] is easy to identify, it is much more about the materials than the design.\n\n=== French Provincial ===\nThis style of design is very ornate. [[French furniture|French Provincial]] objects are often stained or painted, leaving the wood concealed. Corners and bevels are often decorated with gold leaf or given some other kind of gilding.  Flat surfaces often have artwork such as landscapes painted directly on them. The wood used in French provincial varied, but was often originally beech.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=QV9g3DbB1kQC&dq=french+furniture&printsec=frontcover&source=bll&ots=gxO-gTMoO8&sig=JKg93eWCimuhMkJMdHOAtoP0vts&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=11&ct=result#PPT1,M1 |title=French Furniture - Andre Saglio |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Early American Colonial ===\nThis design emphasises both form and materials. [[Colonial furniture|Early American]] chairs and tables are often constructed with turned spindles and chair backs often constructed using steaming to bend the wood. Wood choices tend to be deciduous hardwoods with a particular emphasis on the wood of edible or fruit-bearing trees such as cherry or walnut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/175713/Early-American-furniture |title=Early American furniture - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Rustic ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nThe [[rustic furniture|rustic]] style of design sometimes called \"log furniture\" or \"[[log cabin]]\" is the least finished. Design is very utilitarian yet seeks to feature not only the materials used but in, as much as possible, how they existed in their natural state. For example, a table top may have what is considered a \"live edge\" that allows you to see the original contours of the tree that it came from. It also often uses whole logs or branches including the bark of the tree.  Rustic furniture is often made from [[pine]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[fir]] and [[spruce]]. Also see [[Adirondack Architecture]].\n\n=== Mission Style ===\n[[Mission Style Furniture|Mission Design]] is characterized by straight, thick horizontal and vertical lines and flat panels. The most common material used in [[Mission Style Furniture|Mission furniture]] is oak. For early mission cabinetmakers, the material of choice was white oak, which they often darkened through a process known as [[Ammonia fuming|\"fuming\"]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUdIZJ56XLgC&pg=RA1-PA18&lpg=RA1-PA18&dq=mission+cabinets+fumed+oak+article&source=bl&ots=LdD8UPLMgf&sig=kTUWn75kwEfDlNaddMFDEvGr-4g&hl=en&ei=BUO5SaKXF4KUMc7P1KoI&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result |title=The Stickley Brothers: The Quest for an American Voice - Michael E. Clark, Jill Thomas-Clark |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref> Hardware is often visible on the outside of the pieces and made of black iron. It is a style that became popular in the early 20th century; popularized by designers in the Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveaux movements.\n\n=== Oriental ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nAlso known as [[Asian furniture|Asian Design]], this style of furniture is characterized by its use of materials such as [[bamboo]] and [[rattan]].  Red is a frequent color choice along with landscape art and Chinese or other Asian language characters on the pieces.\n\n=== Shaker ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\n[[Shaker furniture]] design is focused on function and symmetry. Because it is so influenced by an egalitarian religious community and tradition it is rooted in the needs of the community versus the creative expression of the designer. Like Early American and Colonial design, Shaker craftsmen often chose fruit woods for their designs. Pieces reflect a very efficient use of materials.\n\n== Types of cabinetry ==\n {{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 180\n | header=\n | image1 = Cabinetmaking frameless cabinet.svg\n | caption1 = A frameless cabinet| alt1 =\n | image2 = Cabinetmaking face frame cabinet.svg\n | caption2 = A cabinet with a face frame| alt2 =\n}}\nThe fundamental focus of the cabinet maker is the production of cabinetry. Although the cabinet maker may also be required to produce items that would not be recognized as cabinets, the same skills and techniques apply.\n\nA cabinet may be built-in or free-standing. A built-in cabinet is usually custom made for a particular situation and it is fixed into position, on a floor, against a wall, or framed in an opening. For example, modern kitchens are examples of built-in cabinetry. Free-standing cabinets are more commonly available as off-the-shelf items and can be moved from place to place if required. Cabinets may be wall hung or suspended from the ceiling. Cabinet doors may be hinged or sliding and may have mirrors on the inner or outer surface.\n\nCabinets may have a [[face frame]] or may be of [[frameless construction]] (also known as ''European'' or ''euro-style''). Face frame cabinets have a supporting frame attached to the front of the cabinet box. This face frame is usually {{convert|1+1/2|in|cm|0}} in width. Mounted on the cabinet frame is the cabinet door. In contrast, frameless cabinet have no such supporting front face frame, the cabinet doors attach directly to the sides of the cabinet box. The box's side, bottom and top panels are usually {{convert|5/8|to|3/4|in|mm|round=5}} thick, with the door overlaying all but {{convert|1/16|in|mm|0}} of the box edge.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://cabinets-q-and-a.com/refinishing-kitchen-cabinets.html| title=Refinishing and Upgrading Kitchen Cabinets | publisher= CabinetsQandA.com| year=2010| accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\nModern cabinetry is often frameless and is typically constructed from man-made sheet materials, such as [[plywood]], [[Particle board|chipboard]] or [[medium-density fibreboard]] (MDF). The visible surfaces of these materials are usually clad in a timber [[Wood veneer|veneer]], plastic laminate, or other material. They may also be painted.\n\n== Cabinet components ==\n=== Bases ===\n {{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 180\n | header=\n | image1 = Cabinetmaking-kick space base.svg\n | caption1 = Enclosed cabinet base with a kick space | alt1 =\n | image2 =Cabinetmaking-scrolled base.svg\n | caption2 = Scrolled base  | alt2 =\n | image3 = Cabinetmaking bracket foot.svg\n | caption3 = Bracket feet  | alt3 =\n }}\nCabinets which rest on the floor are supported by some base. This base could be a fully enclosed base (i.e. a [[plinth]]), a scrolled based, bracket feet or it could be a set of legs.\n\n=== Adjustable feet ===\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}\nA type of adjustable leg has been adopted from the European cabinet system which offers several advantages. First off, in making base cabinets for kitchens, the cabinet sides would be cut to 34\u00bd inches, yielding four cabinet side blanks per 4 foot by 8 foot sheet. Using the adjustable feet, the side blanks are cut to 30&nbsp;inches, thus yielding six cabinet side per sheet.\n\nThese feet can be secured to the bottom of the cabinet by having the leg base screwed onto the cabinet bottom. They can also be attached by means of a hole drilled through the cabinet bottom at specific locations. The legs are then attached to the cabinet bottom by a slotted, hollow machine screw. The height of the cabinet can be adjusted from inside the cabinet, simply by inserting a screwdriver into the slot and turning to raise or lower the cabinet. The holes in the cabinet are capped by plastic inserts, making the appearance more acceptable for residential cabinets. Using these feet, the cabinets need not be shimmed or scribed to the floor for leveling. The toe kick board is attached to the cabinet by means of a clip, which is either screwed onto the back side of the kick board, or a barbed plastic clip is inserted into a saw kerf, also made on the back side of the kick board. This toe kick board can be made to fit each base cabinet, or made to fit a run of cabinets.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Base_Cabinet_Construction_Sketch.html |title= Base Cabinet Construction Sketch |publisher= ProWoodworkingTips.com |accessdate= 2014-03-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180705075955/http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Base_Cabinet_Construction_Sketch.html |archive-date= 2018-07-05 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nKitchen cabinets, or any cabinet generally at which a person may stand, usually have a fully enclosed base in which the front edge has been set back 75&nbsp;mm or so to provide room for toes, known as the [[kick space]]. A scrolled base is similar to the fully enclosed base but it has areas of the base material removed, often with a decorative pattern, leaving feet on which the cabinet stands. Bracket feet are separate feet, usually attached in each corner and occasionally for larger pieces in the middle of the cabinet.\n\n=== Compartments ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nA cabinet usually has at least one compartment. Compartments may be open, as in open shelving; they may be enclosed by one or more doors; or they may contain one or more drawers. Some cabinets contain secret compartments, access to which is generally not obvious.\n\nModern cabinets employ many more complicated means (relative to a simple shelf) of making browsing lower cabinets more efficient and comfortable. One example is the [[lazy susan]], a shelf which rotates around a central axis, allowing items stored at the back of the cabinet to be brought to the front by rotating the shelf. These are usually used in corner cabinets, which are larger and deeper and have a greater \"dead space\" at the back than other cabinets.\n\n=== Cabinet insert hardware ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nAn alternative to the [[Lazy Susan|lazy susan]], particularly in base cabinets, is the blind corner cabinet pull out unit. These pull out and turn, making the attached shelving unit slide into the open area of the cabinet door, thus making the shelves accessible to the user. These units make usable what was once dead space.\n\nOther insert hardware includes such items as mixer shelves that pull out of a base cabinet and spring into a locked position at counter height. This hardware aids in lifting these somewhat heavy mixers and assists with positioning the unit for use. More and more components are being designed to enable specialized hardware to be used in standard cabinet carcasses.\n\n=== Tops ===\nMost cabinets incorporate a top of some sort. In many cases, the top is merely to enclose the compartments within and serves no other purpose\u2014as in a wall hung cupboard for example. In other cabinets, the top also serves as a work surface\u2014a kitchen countertop for example.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of furniture designers]]\n* [[List of furniture types]]\n* [[Woodworking]]\n* [[Amish furniture]]\n* [[\u00c9b\u00e9niste]] (French for \"cabinet-maker\")\n* [[Tansu]]\n\n== References ==\n;Specific citations\n{{reflist}}\n;General references\n{{refbegin}}\n* Lee Jesberger (2007).

Compared to other designs there is a distinct absence of ornamentation.  While [[Scandinavian design]] is easy to identify, it is much more about the materials than the design.\n\n=== French Provincial ===\nThis style of design is very ornate. [[French furniture|French Provincial]] objects are often stained or painted, leaving the wood concealed. Corners and bevels are often decorated with gold leaf or given some other kind of gilding.  Flat surfaces often have artwork such as landscapes painted directly on them. The wood used in French provincial varied, but was often originally beech.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&id=QV9g3DbB1kQC&dq=french+furniture&printsec=frontcover&source=bll&ots=gxO-gTMoO8&sig=JKg93eWCimuhMkJMdHOAtoP0vts&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=11&ct=result#PPT1,M1 |title=French Furniture - Andre Saglio |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Early American Colonial ===\nThis design emphasises both form and materials. [[Colonial furniture|Early American]] chairs and tables are often constructed with turned spindles and chair backs often constructed using steaming to bend the wood. Wood choices tend to be deciduous hardwoods with a particular emphasis on the wood of edible or fruit-bearing trees such as cherry or walnut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/175713/Early-American-furniture |title=Early American furniture - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Rustic ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nThe [[rustic furniture|rustic]] style of design sometimes called \"log furniture\" or \"[[log cabin]]\" is the least finished. Design is very utilitarian yet seeks to feature not only the materials used but in, as much as possible, how they existed in their natural state. For example, a table top may have what is considered a \"live edge\" that allows you to see the original contours of the tree that it came from. It also often uses whole logs or branches including the bark of the tree.  Rustic furniture is often made from [[pine]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[fir]] and [[spruce]]. Also see [[Adirondack Architecture]].\n\n=== Mission Style ===\n[[Mission Style Furniture|Mission Design]] is characterized by straight, thick horizontal and vertical lines and flat panels. The most common material used in [[Mission Style Furniture|Mission furniture]] is oak. For early mission cabinetmakers, the material of choice was white oak, which they often darkened through a process known as [[Ammonia fuming|\"fuming\"]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUdIZJ56XLgC&pg=RA1-PA18&lpg=RA1-PA18&dq=mission+cabinets+fumed+oak+article&source=bl&ots=LdD8UPLMgf&sig=kTUWn75kwEfDlNaddMFDEvGr-4g&hl=en&ei=BUO5SaKXF4KUMc7P1KoI&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result |title=The Stickley Brothers: The Quest for an American Voice - Michael E. Clark, Jill Thomas-Clark |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref> Hardware is often visible on the outside of the pieces and made of black iron. It is a style that became popular in the early 20th century; popularized by designers in the Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveaux movements.\n\n=== Oriental ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nAlso known as [[Asian furniture|Asian Design]], this style of furniture is characterized by its use of materials such as [[bamboo]] and [[rattan]].  Red is a frequent color choice along with landscape art and Chinese or other Asian language characters on the pieces.\n\n=== Shaker ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\n[[Shaker furniture]] design is focused on function and symmetry. Because it is so influenced by an egalitarian religious community and tradition it is rooted in the needs of the community versus the creative expression of the designer. Like Early American and Colonial design, Shaker craftsmen often chose fruit woods for their designs. Pieces reflect a very efficient use of materials.\n\n== Types of cabinetry ==\n {{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 180\n | header=\n | image1 = Cabinetmaking frameless cabinet.svg\n | caption1 = A frameless cabinet| alt1 =\n | image2 = Cabinetmaking face frame cabinet.svg\n | caption2 = A cabinet with a face frame| alt2 =\n}}\nThe fundamental focus of the cabinet maker is the production of cabinetry. Although the cabinet maker may also be required to produce items that would not be recognized as cabinets, the same skills and techniques apply.\n\nA cabinet may be built-in or free-standing. A built-in cabinet is usually custom made for a particular situation and it is fixed into position, on a floor, against a wall, or framed in an opening. For example, modern kitchens are examples of built-in cabinetry. Free-standing cabinets are more commonly available as off-the-shelf items and can be moved from place to place if required. Cabinets may be wall hung or suspended from the ceiling. Cabinet doors may be hinged or sliding and may have mirrors on the inner or outer surface.\n\nCabinets may have a [[face frame]] or may be of [[frameless construction]] (also known as ''European'' or ''euro-style''). Face frame cabinets have a supporting frame attached to the front of the cabinet box. This face frame is usually {{convert|1+1/2|in|cm|0}} in width. Mounted on the cabinet frame is the cabinet door. In contrast, frameless cabinet have no such supporting front face frame, the cabinet doors attach directly to the sides of the cabinet box. The box's side, bottom and top panels are usually {{convert|5/8|to|3/4|in|mm|round=5}} thick, with the door overlaying all but {{convert|1/16|in|mm|0}} of the box edge.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://cabinets-q-and-a.com/refinishing-kitchen-cabinets.html| title=Refinishing and Upgrading Kitchen Cabinets | publisher= CabinetsQandA.com| year=2010| accessdate=2014-03-19}}</ref>\nModern cabinetry is often frameless and is typically constructed from man-made sheet materials, such as [[plywood]], [[Particle board|chipboard]] or [[medium-density fibreboard]] (MDF). The visible surfaces of these materials are usually clad in a timber [[Wood veneer|veneer]], plastic laminate, or other material. They may also be painted.\n\n== Cabinet components ==\n=== Bases ===\n {{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 180\n | header=\n | image1 = Cabinetmaking-kick space base.svg\n | caption1 = Enclosed cabinet base with a kick space | alt1 =\n | image2 =Cabinetmaking-scrolled base.svg\n | caption2 = Scrolled base  | alt2 =\n | image3 = Cabinetmaking bracket foot.svg\n | caption3 = Bracket feet  | alt3 =\n }}\nCabinets which rest on the floor are supported by some base. This base could be a fully enclosed base (i.e. a [[plinth]]), a scrolled based, bracket feet or it could be a set of legs.\n\n=== Adjustable feet ===\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}\nA type of adjustable leg has been adopted from the European cabinet system which offers several advantages. First off, in making base cabinets for kitchens, the cabinet sides would be cut to 34\u00bd inches, yielding four cabinet side blanks per 4 foot by 8 foot sheet. Using the adjustable feet, the side blanks are cut to 30&nbsp;inches, thus yielding six cabinet side per sheet.\n\nThese feet can be secured to the bottom of the cabinet by having the leg base screwed onto the cabinet bottom. They can also be attached by means of a hole drilled through the cabinet bottom at specific locations. The legs are then attached to the cabinet bottom by a slotted, hollow machine screw. The height of the cabinet can be adjusted from inside the cabinet, simply by inserting a screwdriver into the slot and turning to raise or lower the cabinet. The holes in the cabinet are capped by plastic inserts, making the appearance more acceptable for residential cabinets. Using these feet, the cabinets need not be shimmed or scribed to the floor for leveling. The toe kick board is attached to the cabinet by means of a clip, which is either screwed onto the back side of the kick board, or a barbed plastic clip is inserted into a saw kerf, also made on the back side of the kick board. This toe kick board can be made to fit each base cabinet, or made to fit a run of cabinets.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Base_Cabinet_Construction_Sketch.html |title= Base Cabinet Construction Sketch |publisher= ProWoodworkingTips.com |accessdate= 2014-03-19 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180705075955/http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Base_Cabinet_Construction_Sketch.html |archive-date= 2018-07-05 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n\nKitchen cabinets, or any cabinet generally at which a person may stand, usually have a fully enclosed base in which the front edge has been set back 75&nbsp;mm or so to provide room for toes, known as the [[kick space]]. A scrolled base is similar to the fully enclosed base but it has areas of the base material removed, often with a decorative pattern, leaving feet on which the cabinet stands. Bracket feet are separate feet, usually attached in each corner and occasionally for larger pieces in the middle of the cabinet.\n\n=== Compartments ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nA cabinet usually has at least one compartment. Compartments may be open, as in open shelving; they may be enclosed by one or more doors; or they may contain one or more drawers. Some cabinets contain secret compartments, access to which is generally not obvious.\n\nModern cabinets employ many more complicated means (relative to a simple shelf) of making browsing lower cabinets more efficient and comfortable. One example is the [[lazy susan]], a shelf which rotates around a central axis, allowing items stored at the back of the cabinet to be brought to the front by rotating the shelf. These are usually used in corner cabinets, which are larger and deeper and have a greater \"dead space\" at the back than other cabinets.\n\n=== Cabinet insert hardware ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}\nAn alternative to the [[Lazy Susan|lazy susan]], particularly in base cabinets, is the blind corner cabinet pull out unit. These pull out and turn, making the attached shelving unit slide into the open area of the cabinet door, thus making the shelves accessible to the user. These units make usable what was once dead space.\n\nOther insert hardware includes such items as mixer shelves that pull out of a base cabinet and spring into a locked position at counter height. This hardware aids in lifting these somewhat heavy mixers and assists with positioning the unit for use. More and more components are being designed to enable specialized hardware to be used in standard cabinet carcasses.\n\n=== Tops ===\nMost cabinets incorporate a top of some sort. In many cases, the top is merely to enclose the compartments within and serves no other purpose\u2014as in a wall hung cupboard for example. In other cabinets, the top also serves as a work surface\u2014a kitchen countertop for example.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of furniture designers]]\n* [[List of furniture types]]\n* [[Woodworking]]\n* [[Amish furniture]]\n* [[\u00c9b\u00e9niste]] (French for \"cabinet-maker\")\n* [[Tansu]]\n\n== References ==\n;Specific citations\n{{reflist}}\n;General references\n{{refbegin}}\n* Lee Jesberger (2007).

Even though he loves his family more than anything in this world, he fails to express his love. He had been looking after the family since the death of their mother. Their father Pillechan ([[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]]) is married again with two daughters and his children from the first marriage do not even speak with him (Madhavankutty's uncle Gangadhara Menon is responsible for the separation between the children and Pillechan, which is revealed in a later part of the story). Madhavankutty's marriage was fixed with his neighbour Gauri and his sister Ammu\u2019s marriage with Gauri's brother Balachandran. Once in Madhavankutty's absence, Balachandran sneaked in to his house to be with Ammu, but get caught which results in hostility between the two families and Madhavankutty opposes any of the decided marriages to happen between the families. Balachandran on the other hand wants to make them happen.\n\nThings change when the eldest sister Seetha goes through an unfortunate event, where her unmarried professor under the influence of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], rapes her. Coming back to senses, the professor confesses his act to Madhavankutty. Devastated on hearing this and learning how this incident can affect the lives of his younger sisters, he is forced to go with the solution that the professor puts forward. He gets Seetha married to the professor. His sister Ammu unaware of the facts behind the marriage gets furious with him, while he, being inherently stoic, behaved as a rude dominant to hide the facts. Balachandran finds this as an opportunity to get Ammu, who otherwise wouldn\u2019t do anything against her brother\u2019s wishes. Balachandran and Ammu get married and settle in the neighbourhood.\n\nDue to the new developments, Madhavankutty's uncle Gangadhara Menon ([[Kozhikode Narayanan Nair]]) tries to befriend their rival family \u2013 Kompara. They on the other hand were waiting for an opportunity to take revenge, pretend to offer help, while their real intention was to increase the hatred between Madhavankutty and his uncle as they see Madhavankutty as a threat and can never do anything unless they remain enemies. They also suggest a marriage alliance with Gauri, which Gangadhara Menon approves. Gauri, still in love with Madhavankutty, acts pregnant saying Madhavankutty as the one responsible for it to prevent the marriage. This agitates Gangadhara Menon and under the advice of Nandakumar (from Kompara family), he decides to destroy the lives of Madhavankutty\u2019s sisters, the way he destroyed Gauri's life. Madhavankutty's father learns about the plot and foils them, but it causes the girls and him to end up in the police station. He fails to convince his son about the truth and they become angrier at their father for his behaviour. Nandakumar sees the opportunity and they murder Pillechan. Madhavankutty, even though angry at his father\u2019s deeds, does not desert his half sisters and brings them home, much to the dismay of his sisters who have an argument with him and leaves to Ammu's home to stay. Balachandran realises the seriousness of the situation and asks the girls to go back to their brother. He also say that whatever he did, was for Madhavankutty to stop sacrificing his life for his sisters and to get him married to his sister who loves him for life. Balachandran goes to find Madhavankutty to apologise, but gets attacked by a gang of thugs under the command of a person, seemingly Madhavankutty, while it actually was Krishnanunni the eldest of Kompara family who framed him. Balachandran survives and thinks Madhavankutty did it, which causes everyone, even Gauri to turn against him. Gangadhara Menon along with the ones from Kompara family goes to finish Madhavankutty once and for all, but learns that he himself was the target and Balachandran was not attacked by Madhavankutty. They try to murder Menon thinking after all that has happened Madhavankutty will not dare rescue him, but to their surprise he shows up to save Menon. Wounded Menon at the hospital tells to the rest of the family about his nephew's innocence. Madhavankutty survives the attack and succeeds in getting rid of the Kompara family from their lives. Losing hope at everything he believes, he decides to leave all behind and go someplace. He does not listen to the apologies or requests of the sisters to stay. He asks Balachandran to take care of the sisters and to find a better person for Gauri as he will never be a good husband for her. He begins to leave while a youngster shows up staring at his sisters leading him to chase the one, indicating that he can't stop being himself and can never leave.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mammootty]] as Mamangalath Madhavankutty/'Hitler' Madhavankutty\n* [[Mukesh (Malayalam actor)|Mukesh]] as Mamangalath Balachandran (Madhavankutty's cousin)\n* [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]] as Pillai Chettan, Madhavan Kutty's Father\n* [[Jagadish]] as Hrudayabhanu\n* [[Saikumar (actor)|Saikumar]] as Nandakumar\n* [[M.G.

He begins to leave while a youngster shows up staring at his sisters leading him to chase the one, indicating that he can't stop being himself and can never leave.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Mammootty]] as Mamangalath Madhavankutty/'Hitler' Madhavankutty\n* [[Mukesh (Malayalam actor)|Mukesh]] as Mamangalath Balachandran (Madhavankutty's cousin)\n* [[Innocent (actor)|Innocent]] as Pillai Chettan, Madhavan Kutty's Father\n* [[Jagadish]] as Hrudayabhanu\n* [[Saikumar (actor)|Saikumar]] as Nandakumar\n* [[M.G.
