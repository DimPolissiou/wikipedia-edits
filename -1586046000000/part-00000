Starting with four teams, the LFA has since expanded to eight members as of 2019. The championship game is called [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), and it is currently played on the second Sunday in May. The players are drafted from the country's two [[college football]] conferences: [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]] and [[Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Deportiva Estudiantil de Instituciones Privadas|CONADEIP]].\n\n== History ==\nAmerican football has been played in Mexico since the 1920s and is the fourth most popular sport in the country. The LFA was the brainchild of Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez, a former [[Fox Sports Latin America|Fox Sports]] commentator. V\u00e1zquez was a huge fan of the previous American football league in Mexico called Liga Master, and he had always dreamed of creating his own league. In 2015, V\u00e1zquez (along with Edgar Zapata) managed to put together a group of investors who decided to offer football while the [[NFL]], [[NCAA]], [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]], and CONADEIP are in the offseason and founded the LFA, which would start two weeks after [[Super Bowl 50]]. The LFA would be the first American football league in Mexico in 20 years.<ref>https://weexpats.com/mexican-league-playing-american-football-meet-lfa/</ref>\n\nFour charter members participated in the inaugural 2016 season: the [[Mexicas CDMX|Eagles]], the [[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]], the [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]], and the [[Condors CDMX|Condors]]. All teams were based in [[Mexico City]]. The first game was played February 21, 2016, between the Raptors and the Mayas, with the Mayas winning the game 34-6. The first title game, the [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), was held on April 10, 2016 between the Mayas and the Raptors. The Mayas won Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico I, 29-13. All games were played at the [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Palillo Mart\u00ednez Stadium]] of [[Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City]]. The LFA experienced significant financial problems during 2016, with a season average attendance of only 2,000 per game.  \n\nDespite the financial difficulties of 2016, the LFA expanded to six teams in 2017, with the addition of [[Dinos Saltillo]] (short for \"dinosaurios\", the Spanish word for dinosaurs) and [[Fundidores Monterrey]] (Spanish for smelters or founders), who took players from the college programs in the ONEFA and CONADEIP. Due to the difficulty of travel, the Dinos nearly canceled going to Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/new_site/articulo/dino-a-los-maltratos|title=Dino to the abuse}} Z\u00f3calo(In Spanish)</ref> In the end, the game was played on April 30, 2017 at [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"]] between the Mayas and the Dinos. The Mayas maintained dominance over the league and won the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico for the second time, 24-18.\n\nOn October 28, 2017,  Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez left the presidency of the LFA. The title of President was eliminated and the position of the Commissioner was created, which was occupied by Guillermo Ruiz Burguete<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/para-su-tercera-temporada-lfa-tendra-nueva-cara-lfa-condors-mayas-fundidores/196862|title=For its third season, LFA will have a new face}}</ref> On January 16, the newly appointed LFA commissioner, Guillermo Ruiz Burguete, resigned. The league did not announce his replacement. For operational purposes, the activities of the commissioner were absorbed by the president of the board of directors of the league, \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/renuncia-comisionado-lfa-guillermo-ruiz-burguete-lfa-burguete-comisionado/200234|title=LFA commissioner resignation}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nDuring the 2018 season, the Eagles were renamed the Mexicas. In March, the Mexicas generated controversy by refusing to play against the Dinos in Week 3, after a serious knee injury to wide receiver Mubalama Massimango that occurred in Week 1. The Mexicas claim the injury was not properly attended to by the LFA. Although the league recognized that there was an administrative problem with the medical expenses insurance policy, the Mexicas were punished for their actions. The LFA ruled the Dinos game as a forfeit by the Mexicas, and the Mexicas team was fined [[Mexican peso|Mex$]]657,820.00 (approximately [[U.S. dollar|US$]]32,000) for damages caused to the league, its TV partners, its press partners, the Dinos team, and the fans. Additional, the Mexicas would have to change their franchisee for the 2019 season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://lfa.mx/lfa-fija-su-postura-respecto-al-seguro-de-gastos-medicos-de-los-jugadores/|title=LFA fixes its position regarding the medical expenses insurance of the players}}(In Spanish)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://maximoavance.com/2018/03/lfa-sanciona-mexicas-pero-evitan-rompimiento/|title=LFA sanctions Mexicas but avoid breaking}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2018, the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico was held on a neutral site for the first time, at [[Estadio Azul]]. Originally a half-time show was planned, but the band canceled due to recommendation of Civil Protection force. Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico III featured the Mexicas and the Raptors, with the Mexicas winning their first title by a shutout of 17-0.\n\nIn November 2018, the LFA signed a non-binding Letter of Intent with the [[Canadian Football League]] to share resources and to allow for at least one CFL game to be played in Mexico<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2018/11/23/cfl-lfa-sign-letter-of-intent-to-grow-football-in-canada-and-mexico|accessdate=2018-11-23|title=CFL, LFA sign letter of intent to grow football in Canada and Mexico}}(In Spanish)</ref>. CFL commissioner Randy Ambroise said of the deal later that he hopes it'll raise the level of competition in the LFA and give Canadian football players another competition to compete in if they get dropped from the CFL. \"For so many, if they finish their junior career or college career and they\u2019re not on a CFL roster then there\u2019s kind of nowhere to go and their dream ends, I think that\u2019s a tragedy. This is really about growing the game of football.\" The CFL later held a draft in January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/football/cfl/cfl-holds-combine-mexico-city-effort-grow-football-worldwide/|title=CFL holds combine in Mexico City in effort to grow football worldwide - Sportsnet.ca|website=www.sportsnet.ca|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe LFA considered expanding to 10 teams for the 2019 season, with Guadalajara, Puebla, Queretaro and even Tamaulipas among the four possible expansion candidates.<ref>http://lfa.mx/la-lfa-tendra-diez-equipos-para-2019/#comment-70</ref> However, the league only added two additional franchises: the [[Osos Toluca]] (Bears) and the [[Artilleros Puebla]] (Artillerymen). A new commissioner was announced, Alejandro Jaimes Trujillo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lfa.mx/rumbo-a-la-temporada-2019/|title=Towards the 2019 season}}(In Spanish)</ref> In January 2019, the CFL held a draft for interested LFA players, with 27 of the 51 players selected.\n\nOn September 4, 2019, the LFA announced plans for expansion for the 2020 season. The newest addition was the Pioneros from the city of Queretaro. This was an existing team which previously was a part of the Mexican Football League (FAM) where they were crowned champions in their first season. The Pioneros will play their games at the La Pir\u00e1mide Stadium, which is located in the El Pueblito Sports Unit, in the municipality of Corregidora. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://rotativo.com.mx/2019/09/04/deportes/pioneros-de-queretaro-se-une-a-lfa-para-temporada-2020-792277/|title=Pioneers of Quer\u00e9taro joins LFA for the 2020 season}}(In Spanish)</ref> But with only one new expansion team, the league had an unbalanced amount of teams, presenting difficulty for scheduling. The LFA decided it would only field 8 teams for the 2020 season, with the Mayas going on hiatus for a year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reporteindigo.com/fan/se-va-bicampeon-mayas-lfa-crisis-inversionista/|title=Se va el Bicampe\u00f3n Mayas de la LFA}}(In Spanish)</ref> There is talk of a possible change of headquarters in the south of the republic, or its permanence in Mexico City.

Some of the most notable rules are the [[Replay review in gridiron football|instant replay reviews]], the [[two-minute warning]], the ''coach's challenge'', and the requirement that receivers must have both feet touch the ground in bounds to complete a reception. However, the league has been criticized for not providing adequate refereeing, and it is common for some rules of NCAA football to be applied randomly in games, causing confusion among fans, players, and coaches.\n\n===Salary Cap===\nLike the NFL, the LFA has a salary cap.With the intention of maintaining sports balance, the League has a salary cap that prevents teams from differentiating each other in terms of the level of players they hire. The salary cap is $ 2,000,000 MXN , approximately $ 100,000 USD . There are four salary levels, each of which is determined by the League and is invariable for any team:\n\n*Level 1: foreign players, 5 for each team and 2 Canadians, have the highest salary and bonuses for housing and food.\n*Level 2: franchise players, an offensive and a defensive, must be Mexican and have the second best salary.\n*Level 3: starters, 17 to 20 per team, have a lower salary than level 2.\n*Level 4: depth chart players receive a symbolic bonus.\n*Level 5: practice squad players receive a bonus only if they get to play.\n\n==Season Format==\n===Draft===\nPlayers must have finished their eligibility in college football before playing professionally. Currently, there are two collegiate leagues, the ''Liga Mayor ONEFA'' and the ''Liga Premier CONADEIP''. In these leagues, each player can play five or six years, after which they become eligible for the LFA (they can also declare themselves eligible before finishing their period in college, but it is not usual).\n\nPlayers coming from college football should express their interest in being hired by the LFA. The LFA gives the list of interested players to their teams and they are classified according to the positions they need and the level of each of the players.\n\nEach year in January, interested players and LFA teams meet in a one-day player draft. Each team can choose a player in each of the seven rounds of the draft. The draft order is determined by each teams record from the previous year; the team that finished with the worst record has the first draft pick, the team with the second worst record has the next pick, and so on. Once all the teams have made their first selection, one round ends and the second begins, until the seventh and final round. There are also complementary rounds in case any team still requires players. The best players are very coveted, so being selected in the first round is considered a great honor, especially if it is the very first selection overall.\n\n===Regular Season===\nThe regular season consists of 10 games: 6 divisional games (home and away series) and 4 interdivisional games (two away and two home). The season starts on the third weekend of February and ends in April.\n\n===Post Season===\nAt the end of the regular season, a direct elimination tournament called postseason or playoffs begins, in which the two best teams of each division face each other in the Division Championship in the home stadium of the team with the better record. The postseason occurs between April and May. The winners of these games go to the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico bowl.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ForestGreen; color:white\" | Central Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|''' [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Mexicas CDMX|Mexicas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2018)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Condors CDMX|Condors]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2019)''</center>\n|}\n|width=\"100\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#d63334; color:white\" | North Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|'''[[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]]'''\n| <center>2 ''(2018, 2019)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Dinos Saltillo|Dinos]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|}\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico===\n[[File:Lfa tazon mexico.png|100px|right|thumb|Tazon M\u00e9xico trophy]]\nThe [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (English: ''Mexico Bowl'') is the title game for the LFA that determines the National Champion. The champions of the North Division and the Central Division meet in a neutral stadium. Each edition of the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico is designated with consecutive Roman numerals, similar to the [[Super Bowl]]. In certain editions, the name of a company has been added for sponsorship reasons. It is expected that in the future the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico will have a [[halftime show]].\nThe team with the most championships in the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico is [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]] with two. The team with the most appearances in this event is [[Raptors Edomex|Raptors]] with three.

Starting with four teams, the LFA has since expanded to eight members as of 2019. The championship game is called [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), and it is currently played on the second Sunday in May. The players are drafted from the two College Football conferences that exist in the country: [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]] and [[Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Deportiva Estudiantil de Instituciones Privadas|CONADEIP]].\n\n== History ==\nAmerican football has been played in Mexico since the 1920s and is the fourth most popular sport in the country. The LFA was the brainchild of Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez, a former Fox Sports commentator. V\u00e1zquez was a huge fan of the previous American football league in Mexico called Liga Master, and he had always dreamed of creating his own league. In 2015, V\u00e1zquez (along with Edgar Zapata) managed to put together a group of investors who decided to offer football while the [[NFL]], [[NCAA]], [[Organizaci\u00f3n Nacional Estudiantil de F\u00fatbol Americano|ONEFA]], and CONADEIP are in the offseason and founded the LFA, which would start two weeks after [[Super Bowl 50]]. The LFA would be the first American football league in Mexico in 20 years.<ref>https://weexpats.com/mexican-league-playing-american-football-meet-lfa/</ref>\n\nFour charter members participated in the inaugural 2016 season: the [[Mexicas CDMX|Eagles]], the [[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]], the [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]], and the [[Condors CDMX|Condors]]. All teams were based in [[Mexico City]]. The first game was played February 21, 2016, between the Raptors and the Mayas, with the Mayas winning the game 34-6. The first title game, the [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (Mexico Bowl), was held on April 10, 2016 between the Mayas and the Raptors. The Mayas won Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico I, 29-13. All games were played at the [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Palillo Mart\u00ednez Stadium]] of [[Magdalena Mixhuca Sports City]]. The LFA experienced significant financial problems during 2016, with a season average attendance of only 2,000 per game.  \n\nDespite the financial difficulties of 2016, the LFA expanded to six teams in 2017, with the addition of [[Dinos Saltillo]] (short for \"dinosaurios\", the Spanish word for dinosaurs) and [[Fundidores Monterrey]] (Spanish for smelters or founders), who took players from the college programs in the ONEFA and CONADEIP. Due to the difficulty of travel, the Dinos nearly canceled going to Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/new_site/articulo/dino-a-los-maltratos|title=Dino to the abuse}} Z\u00f3calo(In Spanish)</ref> In the end, the game was played on April 30, 2017 at [[Estadio Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"|Jes\u00fas Mart\u00ednez \"Palillo\"]] between the Mayas and the Dinos. The Mayas maintained dominance over the league and won the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico for the second time, 24-18.\n\nOn October 28, 2017,  Juan Carlos V\u00e1zquez left the presidency of the LFA. The title of President was eliminated and the position of the Commissioner was created, which was occupied by Guillermo Ruiz Burguete<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/para-su-tercera-temporada-lfa-tendra-nueva-cara-lfa-condors-mayas-fundidores/196862|title=For its third season, LFA will have a new face}}</ref> On January 16, the newly appointed LFA commissioner, Guillermo Ruiz Burguete, resigned. The league did not announce his replacement. For operational purposes, the activities of the commissioner were absorbed by the president of the board of directors of the league, \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lasillarota.com/deportes/renuncia-comisionado-lfa-guillermo-ruiz-burguete-lfa-burguete-comisionado/200234|title=LFA commissioner resignation}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nDuring the 2018 season, the Eagles were renamed the Mexicas. In March, the Mexicas generated controversy by refusing to play against the Dinos in Week 3, after a serious knee injury to wide receiver Mubalama Massimango that occurred in Week 1. The Mexicas claim the injury was not properly attended to by the LFA. Although the league recognized that there was an administrative problem with the medical expenses insurance policy, the Mexicas were punished for their actions. The LFA ruled the Dinos game as a forfeit by the Mexicas, and the Mexicas team was fined [[Mexican peso|Mex$]]657,820.00 (approximately [[U.S. dollar|US$]]32,000) for damages caused to the league, its TV partners, its press partners, the Dinos team, and the fans. Additional, the Mexicas would have to change their franchisee for the 2019 season. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://lfa.mx/lfa-fija-su-postura-respecto-al-seguro-de-gastos-medicos-de-los-jugadores/|title=LFA fixes its position regarding the medical expenses insurance of the players}}(In Spanish)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://maximoavance.com/2018/03/lfa-sanciona-mexicas-pero-evitan-rompimiento/|title=LFA sanctions Mexicas but avoid breaking}}(In Spanish)</ref>\n\nOn April 22, 2018, the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico was held on a neutral site for the first time, at [[Estadio Azul]]. Originally a half-time show was planned, but the band canceled due to recommendation of Civil Protection force. Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico III featured the Mexicas and the Raptors, with the Mexicas winning their first title by a shutout of 17-0.\n\nIn November 2018, the LFA signed a non-binding Letter of Intent with the [[Canadian Football League]] to share resources and to allow for at least one CFL game to be played in Mexico<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toronto.citynews.ca/2018/11/23/cfl-lfa-sign-letter-of-intent-to-grow-football-in-canada-and-mexico|accessdate=2018-11-23|title=CFL, LFA sign letter of intent to grow football in Canada and Mexico}}(In Spanish)</ref>. CFL commissioner Randy Ambroise said of the deal later that he hopes it'll raise the level of competition in the LFA and give Canadian football players another competition to compete in if they get dropped from the CFL. \"For so many, if they finish their junior career or college career and they\u2019re not on a CFL roster then there\u2019s kind of nowhere to go and their dream ends, I think that\u2019s a tragedy. This is really about growing the game of football.\" The CFL later held a draft in January 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/football/cfl/cfl-holds-combine-mexico-city-effort-grow-football-worldwide/|title=CFL holds combine in Mexico City in effort to grow football worldwide - Sportsnet.ca|website=www.sportsnet.ca|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>\n\nThe LFA considered expanding to 10 teams for the 2019 season, with Guadalajara, Puebla, Queretaro and even Tamaulipas among the four possible expansion candidates.<ref>http://lfa.mx/la-lfa-tendra-diez-equipos-para-2019/#comment-70</ref> However, the league only added two additional franchises: the [[Osos Toluca]] (Bears) and the [[Artilleros Puebla]] (Artillerymen).

The newest addition was the Pioneros from the city of Queretaro. This was an existing team which previously was a part of the Mexican Football League (FAM) where they were crowned champions in their first season. The Pioneros will play their games at the La Pir\u00e1mide Stadium, which is located in the El Pueblito Sports Unit, in the municipality of Corregidora. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://rotativo.com.mx/2019/09/04/deportes/pioneros-de-queretaro-se-une-a-lfa-para-temporada-2020-792277/|title=Pioneers of Quer\u00e9taro joins LFA for the 2020 season}}(In Spanish)</ref> But with only one new expansion team, the league had an unbalanced amount of teams, presenting difficulty for scheduling.

Some of the most notable rules are the [[Replay review in gridiron football|instant replay reviews]], the [[two-minute warning]], the ''coach's challenge'', and the requirement that receivers must have both feet touch the ground in bounds to complete a reception. However, the league has been criticized for not providing adequate refereeing, and it is common for some rules of NCAA football to be applied randomly in games, causing confusion among fans, players, and coaches.\n\n===Salary Cap===\nLike the NFL, the LFA has a salary cap.With the intention of maintaining sports balance, the League has a salary cap that prevents teams from differentiating each other in terms of the level of players they hire. The salary cap is $ 2,000,000 MXN , approximately $ 100,000 USD . There are four salary levels, each of which is determined by the League and is invariable for any team:\n\n*Level 1: foreign players, 5 for each team and 2 Canadians, have the highest salary and bonuses for housing and food.\n*Level 2: franchise players, an offensive and a defensive, must be Mexican and have the second best salary.\n*Level 3: starters, 17 to 20 per team, have a lower salary than level 2.\n*Level 4: depth chart players receive a symbolic bonus.\n*Level 5: practice squad players receive a bonus only if they get to play.\n\n==Season Format==\n===Draft===\nPlayers must have finished their eligibility in college football before playing professionally. Currently, there are two collegiate leagues, the ''Liga Mayor ONEFA'' and the ''Liga Premier CONADEIP''. In these leagues, each player can play five or six years, after which they become eligible for the LFA (they can also declare themselves eligible before finishing their period in college, but it is not usual).\n\nPlayers coming from college football should express their interest in being hired by the LFA. The LFA gives the list of interested players to their teams and they are classified according to the positions they need and the level of each of the players.\n\nEach year in January, interested players and LFA teams meet in a one-day player draft. Each team can choose a player in each of the seven rounds of the draft. The draft order is determined by each teams record from the previous year; the team that finished with the worst record has the first draft pick, the team with the second worst record has the next pick, and so on. Once all the teams have made their first selection, one round ends and the second begins, until the seventh and final round. There are also complementary rounds in case any team still requires players. The best players are very coveted, so being selected in the first round is considered a great honor, especially if it is the very first selection overall.\n\n===Regular Season===\nThe regular season consists of 10 games: 6 divisional games (home and away series) and 4 interdivisional games (two away and two home). The season starts on the third weekend of February and ends in April.\n\n===Post Season===\nAt the end of the regular season, a direct elimination tournament called postseason or playoffs begins, in which the two best teams of each division face each other in the Division Championship in the home stadium of the team with the better record. The postseason occurs between April and May. The winners of these games go to the Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico bowl.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:ForestGreen; color:white\" | Central Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|''' [[Mayas CDMX|Mayas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Mexicas CDMX|Mexicas]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2018)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Condors CDMX|Condors]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2019)''</center>\n|}\n|width=\"100\"|&nbsp;\n|valign=\"top\"|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#d63334; color:white\" | North Division\n|-\n!Team\n!Championships\n|-\n|'''[[Raptors Naucalpan|Raptors]]'''\n| <center>2 ''(2018, 2019)''</center>\n|-\n|'''[[Dinos Saltillo|Dinos]]'''\n| <center>1 ''(2017)''</center>\n|}\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico===\n[[File:Lfa tazon mexico.png|100px|right|thumb|Tazon M\u00e9xico trophy]]\nThe [[Taz\u00f3n M\u00e9xico]] (English: ''Mexico Bowl'') is the title game for the LFA that determines the National Champion.

The term ethnic Japanese refers to the Indigenous [[Japanese people]] of the [[Japanese archipelago]]. Over the course of centuries the minority ethnic groups such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuans]] were mostly assimilated into the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] population. Mixed race couples and thus h\u0101fu people were rare in [[feudal Japan]]. There were mixed Asian couples between ethnic Japanese and other East and Southeast Asian peoples.\n\nThe most well-regarded theory is that present-day [[Yamato people|Yamato Japanese]] are descendants of both the Indigenous [[J\u014dmon people]] and the immigrant [[Yayoi people]].<ref name=\"Kiriyama17\">{{cite journal |author1=Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama |author2=Kirill Kryukov |author3=Timothy A Jinam |author4=Kazuyoshi Hosomichi |author5=Aiko Saso |author6=Gen Suwa |author7=Shintaroh Ueda |author8=Minoru Yoneda |author9=Atsushi Tajima |author10=Ken-ichi Shinoda |author11=Ituro Inoue |author12=Naruya Saitou1 |date=February 2017 |title=A partial nuclear genome of the Jomons who lived 3000 years ago in Fukushima, Japan |journal=[[Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=213\u2013221 |doi=10.1038/jhg.2016.110 |pmid=27581845 |pmc=5285490 }}</ref> The Yayoi were an admixture (1,000 BCE\u2013300 CE) of migrants from [[East Asia]] (mostly [[China]] and the [[Korean peninsula]]).\n\nModern mainland (Yamato) Japanese have less than 20% Jomon people's genomes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A partial nuclear genome of the Jomons who lived 3000 years ago in Fukushima, Japan |journal = Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 62|issue = 2|pages = 213\u2013221|date=2016-06-01|pmc = 5285490|last1 = Kanzawa-Kiriyama|first1 = H.|last2 = Kryukov|first2 = K.|last3 = Jinam|first3 = T.

It is still used in [[Latin America]], most prominently [[Brazil]] (where spellings such as ''ainoco'', ''ainoca'' (f.) and ''ainoc\u00f4'' may be found), to refer to ''[[mestizo]]'' (broader Spanish sense of mixed race in general) or ''mesti\u00e7o'' people of some Japanese ancestry. Nevertheless, it evolved to an umbrella term for [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] or mixed Asian/mestizo, Asian/black, Asian/Arab and Asian/indigenous heritage in general. At the same time it is possible for people with little Japanese or other Asian ancestry to be perceivable just by their phenotype to identify mostly as black, white or mestizo/pardo instead of ''ainoko'', while people with about a quarter or less of non-Asian ancestry may identify just as Asian.\n\nSoon this, too, became a taboo term due to its derogatory connotations such as illegitimacy and discrimination.

The term ethnic Japanese refers to the Indigenous [[Japanese people]] of the [[Japanese archipelago]]. Over the course of centuries the minority ethnic groups such as the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] and [[Ryukyuans]] were mostly assimilated into the [[Yamato people|Yamato]] population. Mixed race couples and thus h\u0101fu people were rare in [[feudal Japan]]. There were mixed Asian couples between ethnic Japanese and other East and Southeast Asian peoples.\n\nThe most well-regarded theory is that present-day [[Yamato people|Yamato Japanese]] are descendants of both the Indigenous [[J\u014dmon people]] and the immigrant [[Yayoi people]].<ref name=\"Kiriyama17\">{{cite journal |author1=Hideaki Kanzawa-Kiriyama |author2=Kirill Kryukov |author3=Timothy A Jinam |author4=Kazuyoshi Hosomichi |author5=Aiko Saso |author6=Gen Suwa |author7=Shintaroh Ueda |author8=Minoru Yoneda |author9=Atsushi Tajima |author10=Ken-ichi Shinoda |author11=Ituro Inoue |author12=Naruya Saitou1 |date=February 2017 |title=A partial nuclear genome of the Jomons who lived 3000 years ago in Fukushima, Japan |journal=[[Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=62 |issue=2 |pages=213\u2013221 |doi=10.1038/jhg.2016.110 |pmid=27581845 |pmc=5285490 }}</ref> The Yayoi were an admixture (1,000 BCE\u2013300 CE) of migrants from [[East Asia]] (mostly [[China]] and the [[Korean peninsula]]).\n\nModern mainland (Yamato) Japanese have less than 20% Jomon people's genomes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=A partial nuclear genome of the Jomons who lived 3000 years ago in Fukushima, Japan |journal = Journal of Human Genetics|volume = 62|issue = 2|pages = 213\u2013221|date=2016-06-01|pmc = 5285490|last1 = Kanzawa-Kiriyama|first1 = H.|last2 = Kryukov|first2 = K.|last3 = Jinam|first3 = T.

It is still used in [[Latin America]], most prominently [[Brazil]] (where spellings such as ''ainoco'', ''ainoca'' (f.) and ''ainoc\u00f4'' may be found), to refer to ''[[mestizo]]'' (broader Spanish sense of mixed race in general) or ''mesti\u00e7o'' people of some Japanese ancestry. Nevertheless, it evolved to an umbrella term for [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] or mixed Asian/mestizo, Asian/black, Asian/Arab and Asian/indigenous heritage in general. At the same time it is possible for people with little Japanese or other Asian ancestry to be perceivable just by their phenotype to identify mostly as black, white or mestizo/pardo instead of ''ainoko'', while people with about a quarter or less of non-Asian ancestry may identify just as Asian.\n\nSoon this, too, became a taboo term due to its derogatory connotations such as illegitimacy and discrimination. What were central to these labels were the emphasis on \"blood impurity\" and the obvious separation of the half Japanese from the majority of Japanese. Some English-speaking parents of children of mixed ethnicity use the word \"double.\"<ref name=\"japantimes1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20090127zg.html|title=Half, bi or double?

In [[analytical chemistry]], a standardized [[aqueous]] solution of KMnO<sub>4</sub> is sometimes used as an oxidizing [[titration|titrant]] for [[redox titration]]s ([[permanganometry]]). As potassium permanganate is titrated, the solution becomes a light shade of magenta, which darkens as excess of the titrant is added to the solution. In a related way, it is used as a [[reagent]] to determine the [[Kappa number]] of wood pulp.

He patented this solution, and marketed it as 'Condy's Fluid'. Although effective, the solution was not very stable. This was overcome by using [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) rather than NaOH. This was more stable, and had the advantage of easy conversion to the equally effective potassium permanganate crystals. This crystalline material was known as 'Condy's crystals' or 'Condy's powder'. Potassium permanganate was comparatively easy to manufacture, so Condy was subsequently forced to spend considerable time in litigation to stop competitors from marketing similar products.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=OW19000802.2.357|title=Important Trade Mark Case|journal=Otago Witness|volume=2|issue=2420|date=2 August 1900|page=53|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003229/http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=OW19000802.2.357|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nEarly photographers used it as a component of [[flash powder]]. It is now replaced with other oxidizers, due to the instability of permanganate mixtures.\n\n== Preparation ==\nPotassium permanganate is produced industrially from [[manganese dioxide]], which also occurs as the mineral [[pyrolusite]]. The MnO<sub>2</sub> is fused with [[potassium hydroxide]] and heated in [[air]] or with another source of oxygen, like [[potassium nitrate]] or [[potassium chlorate]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/> This process gives [[potassium manganate]]:\n:2 MnO<sub>2</sub> + 4 KOH + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n(With sodium hydroxide, the end product is not [[sodium manganate]] but an Mn(V) compound, which is one reason the potassium permanganate is more commonly used than [[sodium permanganate]]. Furthermore, the potassium salt crystallizes better.<ref name=\"Ullmann\"/>)\n\nThe potassium manganate is then converted into permanganate by [[electrolysis|electrolytic oxidation]] in alkaline media:\n:2 K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub>  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>O   \u2192  2 KMnO<sub>4</sub>  +  2 KOH  +  H<sub>2</sub>\n\n===Other methods===\nAlthough of no commercial importance, potassium manganate can be oxidized by [[chlorine]] or by [[disproportionation]] under acid conditions.<ref>Walton, H.

[[Qualitative inorganic analysis|Tests]] for the presence of manganese exploit the vivid violet color of permanganate produced by these reagents.\n\n==Structure==\nKMnO<sub>4</sub> forms [[orthorhombic]] crystals with constants: ''a'' = 910.5&nbsp;[[picometre|pm]], ''b'' = 572.0&nbsp;pm, ''c'' = 742.5&nbsp;pm.

This behaviour is also used as a [[qualitative chemical analysis|qualitative]] [[chemical test|test]] for the presence of double or triple bonds in a molecule, since the reaction decolorizes the initially purple permanganate solution and generates a brown precipitate (MnO<sub>2</sub>). In this context, it is sometimes called ''Baeyer's reagent''. However, [[bromine]] serves better in measuring unsaturation (double or triple bonds) quantitatively, since KMnO<sub>4</sub>, being a very strong oxidizing agent, can react with a variety of groups.\n\nUnder acidic conditions, the alkene double bond is cleaved to give the appropriate [[carboxylic acid]]:<ref>{{OrgSynth|title = Carboxylic Acids from the Oxidation of Terminal Alkenes by Permanganate: Nonadecanoic Acid|author = Donald G.

The Mn-containing products from [[redox reaction]]s depend on the [[pH]]. [[Acidic]] solutions of permanganate are [[redox|reduced]] to the faintly pink manganese(II) ion (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) and water. In [[pH|neutral]] solution, permanganate is only reduced by three electrons to give [[manganese dioxide]] (MnO<sub>2</sub>), wherein manganese is in a +4 oxidation state. This is the material that stains one's skin when handling KMnO<sub>4</sub>. KMnO<sub>4</sub> spontaneously reduces in an [[alkaline]] solution to green [[potassium manganate|K<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub>]], wherein manganese is in the +6 oxidation state.\n\nA curious reaction occurs upon addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to potassium permanganate.

Chagasic meningoencephalitis and myocarditis, separately or in association, have been observed more commonly in patients with AIDS (75\u201480% of cases) than in patients with other causes of immunosuppression.

The use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressors and cytostatic agents, the progress in organ transplantation, and in particular the emergence of AIDS in 1981 have set conditions for infection reactivation in chronic chagasic patients. Chagasic meningoencephalitis and myocarditis, separately or in association, have been observed more commonly in patients with AIDS (75\u201480% of cases) than in patients with other causes of immunosuppression. In some patients, chagasic encephalitis may be the first manifestation of AIDS. Many patients have the pseudotumoral form (brain \u2018chagoma\u2019), characterized by the presence of single or multiple necrotic-hemorrhagic nodular lesions, usually located in the white matter of the cerebral lobes and, in some cases, in the brain stem and cerebellum.
