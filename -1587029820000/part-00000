A period of Coptic-Arabic bilingualism in [[Lower Egypt]] lasted for more than three centuries. The period would last much longer in the south. Arabic had been already familiar to Valley Egyptians since Arabic had been spoken throughout the [[Eastern Desert]] and [[Sinai (peninsula)|Sinai]]. Arabic was also a minority language of some residents of the Nile Valley such as [[Qift]] in Upper Egypt through pre-Islamic trade with [[Nabateans]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the easternmost part of the [[Nile Delta]]. Egyptian Arabic seems to have begun taking shape in [[Fustat]], the first Islamic capital of Egypt, now part of [[Cairo]].\n\nOne of the earliest linguistic sketches of Cairene Arabic is a 16th-century document entitled ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Daf\u02bf al-\u02bei\u1e63r \u02bfan kal\u0101m ahl Mi\u1e63r}}'' ([https://www.academia.edu/39310493/Edition_of_Daf_al-Isr_%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%B9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B5%D8%B1_%D8%B9%D9%86_%D9%83%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85_%D8%A3%D9%87%D9%84_%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1]{{lang|ar|\u062f\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0635\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0623\u0647\u0644 \u0645\u0635\u0631}}, \"The Removal of the Burden from the Language of the People of Cairo\") by [[Yusuf al-Maghribi]] ({{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a}}). With Misr here meaning Cairo. It contains key information on early Cairene Arabic and the language situation in [[Egypt in the Middle Ages]]. The main purpose of the document was to show that while the Cairenes' vernacular contained many critical \"errors\" vis-\u00e0-vis Classical Arabic, according to al-Maghribi, it was also related to Arabic in other respects. With many waves of immigration from the Arabian peninsula such as the [[Banu Hilal]] exodus, together with the ongoing [[Islamization]] and [[Arabization]] of the country, multiple Arabic varieties, one of which is Egyptian Arabic, slowly supplanted spoken Coptic. Local chroniclers mention the continued use of Coptic as a spoken language until the 17th century by peasant women in [[Upper Egypt]]. Coptic is still the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].\n\n== Official status ==\nEgyptian Arabic has no official status and is not officially recognized as a language. [[Modern Standard Arabic]], a modernized form of [[Classical Arabic]] (also called Qur'anic Arabic), is the official language of Egypt (see [[diglossia]]). Interest in the local [[vernacular]] began in the 1800s, as the Egyptian national movement for [[self-determination]] was taking shape. For many decades to follow, questions about the reform and the modernization of Arabic were hotly debated in Egyptian intellectual circles. Proposals ranged from developing [[neologism]]s to replace archaic terminology in Modern Standard Arabic to the simplification of syntactical and morphological rules and the introduction of [[colloquialism]]s to even complete \"Egyptianization\" (''tam\u1e63\u012br'') by abandoning the so-called Modern Standard Arabic in favor of Masri or Egyptian Arabic.<ref name=\"Gershoni\">{{Cite book|author=Gershoni, I., J. Jankowski. |title=Egypt, Islam, and the Arabs |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=1987}}</ref>\n\nProponents of language reform in Egypt included [[Qasim Amin]], who also wrote the first Egyptian feminist treatise, former President of the [[Cairo University|Egyptian University]], [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], and noted intellectual [[Salama Moussa]]. They adopted a modernist, [[secular]] approach and disagreed with the assumption that Arabic was an immutable language because of its association with the [[Qur'an]]. The first modern Egyptian novel in which the dialogue was written in the vernacular was [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]]'s [[Zaynab (novel)|''Zaynab'']] in 1913. It was inly in 1966 that [[Ali Moustafa Mosharafa|Mustafa Musharafa]]'s ''Kantara Who Disbelieved'' was released, the first novel to be written entirely in Egyptian Arabic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/18/62/50815/Books/Review/Book-Review-First-novel-written-in-colloquial-Arab.aspx|title=Book Review: First novel written in colloquial Arabic republished \u2013 Review \u2013 Books \u2013 Ahram Online|publisher=}}</ref> Other notable novelists, such as [[Ihsan Abdel Quddous]] and [[Yusuf Idris]], and poets, such as [[Salah Jahin]], [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi]] and [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]], helped solidify vernacular literature as a distinct literary genre.<ref name=\"Gershoni\" />\n\nAmongst certain groups within Egypt's elite, Egyptian Arabic enjoyed a brief period of rich literary output. That dwindled with the rise of Egyptian [[Arab nationalism]], which had gained wide popularity in Egypt by the final years of the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]], as demonstrated vividly by Egypt's involvement in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] under King [[Farouk of Egypt]]. The [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]], led by [[Mohammed Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], further enhanced the significance of Arab nationalism, making it a central element of Egyptian state policy. The importance of Modern Standard Arabic was reemphasised in the public sphere by the revolutionary government, and efforts to accord any formal language status to the Egyptian vernacular were ignored. Egyptian Arabic was identified as a mere dialect, one that was not spoken even in all of Egypt, as almost all of [[Upper Egypt]] speaks [[Sa'idi Arabic]]. Though the revolutionary government heavily sponsored the use of the Egyptian vernacular in films, plays, television programmes, and music, the prerevolutionary use of Modern Standard Arabic in official publications was retained.\n\nLinguistic commentators have noted the multi-faceted approach of the Egyptian revolutionaries towards the Arabic language. Whereas Egypt's first [[president of Egypt|president]], Mohammed Naguib exhibited a preference for using Modern Standard Arabic in his public speeches, his successor, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] was renowned for using the vernacular and for punctuating his speeches with traditional Egyptian words and expressions. Conversely, Modern Standard Arabic was the norm for state news outlets, including newspapers, magazines, television, and radio. That was especially true of Egypt's national broadcasting company, the [[ERTU|Arab Radio and Television Union]], which was established with the intent of providing content for the entire [[Arab world]], not merely Egypt, hence the need to broadcast in the standard, rather than the vernacular, language. The [[Voice of the Arabs]] radio station, in particular, had an audience from across the region, and the use of anything other than Modern Standard Arabic was viewed as eminently incongruous.\n\nAs the status of Egyptian Arabic as opposed to [[Classical Arabic]] can have such political and religious implications in Egypt, the question of whether Egyptian Arabic should be considered a [[Dialect#\"Dialect\" or \"language\"|\"dialect\" or \"language\"]] can be a source of debate. In [[sociolinguistics]], Egyptian Arabic can be seen as one of many distinct [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] that, despite arguably being languages on ''[[Abstand and ausbau languages|abstand]]'' grounds, are united by a common ''[[abstand and ausbau languages#Roofing|dachsprache]]'' in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).\n\n== Publications ==\nDuring the early 1900s many portions of the Bible were published in Egyptian Arabic.  These were published by the Nile Mission Press.  By 1932 the whole New Testament and some books of the Old Testament had been published in Egyptian Arabic in Arabic script.\n\n== Spoken varieties ==\n[[Sa'idi Arabic|Sa\u2018\u012bdi Arabic]] is a different variety than Egyptian Arabic in [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aec Ethnologue.com] and [http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=aec ISO 639-3] and in other sources,<ref>David Dalby, 1999/2000, ''The Linguasphere Register'', The Linguasphere Observatory<br />William Bright, 1992, ''The International Encyclopedia of Linguistics'', Oxford.</ref> and the two varieties have limited [[mutual intelligibility]]. It carries little prestige nationally but continues to be widely spoken, with 19,000,000 speakers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aec|title=Arabic, Sa'idi Spoken|publisher=}}</ref> including in the north by rural migrants who have adapted partially to Egyptian Arabic. For example, the Sa\u2018\u012bdi genitive exponent is usually replaced with Egyptian ''{{transl|arz|bit\u0101\u02bf&nbsp;}}'', but the realization of {{IPAslink|\u0294}} as {{IPAblink|\u0261}} is retained.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Second-and third-generation migrants are [[monolingual]] in Egyptian Arabic but maintain cultural and familial ties to the south.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nThe traditional division between [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] and their respective differences go back to ancient times. Egyptians today commonly call the people of the north '''{{transl|arz|ba\u1e25arwa}}''' ({{IPA|[b\u0251\u02c8\u0127\u0251\u027ew\u0251]}}) and those of the south '''{{transl|arz|\u1e63a\u02bfayda}}''' ({{IPA|[s\u02e4\u0251\u02c8\u0295\u0251jd\u0251]}}). The differences throughout Egypt, however, are more wide-ranging and do not neatly correspond to the simple division. The language shifts from the eastern to the western parts of the [[Nile Delta]], and the varieties spoken from [[Giza]] to [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] are further grouped into a Middle Egypt cluster. Despite the differences, there are features distinguishing all the Egyptian Arabic varieties of the Nile Valley from any other varieties of Arabic. Such features include [[vowel reduction|reduction of long vowels]] in open and unstressed syllables, the postposition of demonstratives and interrogatives, the modal meaning of the imperfect and the integration of the participle.<ref>Versteegh, p. 162</ref>\n\nThe [[Libyan Arabic|Western Egyptian Bedawi Arabic]] variety<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ayl|title=Arabic, Libyan Spoken|publisher=}}</ref> of the western desert differs from all other Arabic varieties in Egypt in that it linguistically is part of [[Maghrebi Arabic]].<ref>David Dalby, 1999/2000, ''The Linguasphere Register'', The Linguasphere Observatory</ref> The same was formerly true of the Egyptian form of [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judaeo-Arabic]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} [[Northwest Arabian Arabic]] is also distinct from Egyptian Arabic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=avl|title=Arabic, Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Spoken|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Egyptian Arabic phonology}}\nEgyptian Arabic has a phonology that differs slightly from that of other varieties of Arabic and has its own inventory of consonants and vowels.\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n=== Nouns ===\nIn contrast to CA and MSA, nouns are not inflected for case and lack [[nunation]] (with the exception of certain fixed phrases in the accusative case, such as {{lang|ar|\u0634\u0643\u0631\u0627\u064b}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283ok\u027e\u0251n]}}, \"thank you\"). As all nouns take their [[pausal pronunciation|pausal]] forms, singular words and [[broken plural]]s simply lose their case endings. In sound plurals and dual forms, where, in MSA, difference in case is present even in pausal forms, the genitive/accusative form is the one preserved. Fixed expressions in the [[construct state]] beginning in ''abu'', often geographic names, retain their ''-u'' in all cases.<ref>See e.g. Behnstedt & Woidich (2005)</ref>\n\n==== Plurals ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Most common broken plural patterns\n!

Clitics can be attached to the following types of words:\n*A clitic pronoun attached to a noun indicates possession: ''b\u00e9et'' \"house\", ''b\u00e9et-i'' \"my house\"; ''sikk\u00edina'' \"knife\", ''sikk\u00ednt-i'' \"my knife\";  ''\u0294\u00e1bb'' \"father\", ''\u0294ab\u00fau-ya'' \"my father\".  Note that the form of a pronoun may vary depending on the phonological form of the word being attached to (ending with a vowel or with one or two consonants), and the noun being attached to may also have a separate \"construct\" form before possessive clitic suffixes.\n*A clitic pronoun attached to a preposition indicates the object of the preposition:  ''minno'' \"from it (masculine object)\", ''\u0295aleyha'' \"on it (feminine object)\"\n*A clitic pronoun attached to a verb indicates the object of the verb: ''\u0283\u00faft'' \"I saw\", ''\u0283\u00faft-u'' \"I saw him\", ''\u0283uft-\u00e1ha'' \"I saw her\".\n\nWith verbs, indirect object clitic pronouns can be formed using the preposition ''li-'' plus a clitic.  Both direct and indirect object clitic pronouns can be attached to a single verb: ''ag\u00edib'' \"I bring\", ''ag\u00edb-hu'' \"I bring it\", ''agib-h\u00fau-lik'' \"I bring it to you\", ''m-agib-hu-lk\u00edi-\u0283'' \"I do not bring it to you\".\n\n=== Verbs ===\nVerbs in Arabic are based on a stem made up of three or four consonants. The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes and/or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person, and number, in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as [[causative]], [[intensive]], [[passive voice|passive]] or [[reflexive verb|reflexive]].\n\nEach particular [[lexical verb]] is specified by two stems, one used for the past tense and one used for non-past tenses along with as [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]] moods. To the former stem, suffixes are added to mark the verb for person, number, and gender, while to the latter stem, a combination of prefixes and suffixes are added. (Very approximately, the prefixes specify the person and the suffixes indicate number and gender.) The third person masculine singular past tense form serves as the \"dictionary form\" used to identify a verb, similar to the [[infinitive]] in English (Arabic has no infinitive). For example, the verb meaning \"write\" is often specified as ''k\u00e1tab'', which actually means \"he wrote\".  In the paradigms below, a verb will be specified as ''k\u00e1tab/y\u00edktib'' (where ''k\u00e1tab'' means \"he wrote\" and ''y\u00edktib'' means \"he writes\"), indicating the past stem (''katab-'') and non-past stem (''-ktib-'', obtained by removing the prefix ''yi-'').\n\nThe verb classes in Arabic are formed along two axes.  One axis (described as \"form I\", \"form II\", etc.) is used to specify grammatical concepts such as [[causative]], [[intensive]], [[passive voice|passive]], or [[reflexive verb|reflexive]], and involves varying the stem form.  For example, from the root K-T-B \"write\" is derived form I '''k\u00e1tab/y\u00edktib''' \"write\", form II '''k\u00e1ttib/yik\u00e1ttib''' \"cause to write\", form III '''k\u00e1:tib/yik\u00e1:tib''' \"correspond\", etc.  The other axis is determined by the particular consonants making up the root.  For example, defective verbs have a W or Y as the last root consonant, which is often reflected in paradigms with an extra final vowel in the stem (e.g. '''r\u00e1ma/y\u00edrmi''' \"throw\" from R-M-Y); meanwhile, hollow verbs have a W or Y as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs appear to have only two consonants (e.g. '''g\u00e1:b/yig\u00ed:b''' \"bring\" from G-Y-B).\n\n==== Strong verbs ====\nStrong verbs are those that have no \"weakness\" (e.g. W or Y) in the root consonants.\nEach verb has a given vowel pattern for Past (a or i) and Present (a or i or u). Combinations of each exist.\n\n===== Regular verbs, form I =====\n\nForm I verbs have a given vowel pattern for past ('''a''' or '''i''') and present ('''a''', '''i''' or '''u''').

The primary differences are:\n*The occurrence of ''i'' and ''a'' in the stems are reversed: ''i'' in the past, ''a'' in the non-past.\n*In the past, instead of the stems '''ram\u00e9:-''' and '''r\u00e1m-''', the verb has '''nis\u00ed:-''' (with a consonant-initial suffix) and '''n\u00edsy-''' (with a vowel initial suffix).  Note in particular the |y| in '''n\u00edsyit''' and '''n\u00edsyu''' as opposed to '''r\u00e1mit''' and '''r\u00e1mu'''.\n*Elision of ''i'' in '''nis\u00ed:-''' can occur, e.g. '''\u00e1na ns\u00ed:t''' \"I forgot\".\n*In the non-past, because the stem has ''a'' instead of ''i'', there is no homonymy between masculine '''t\u00ed-nsa, \u00ed-nsa''' and feminine '''t\u00ed-ns-i, \u00ed-ns-i'''.\n\nNote that some other verbs have different stem variations, e.g. '''m\u00ed\u0283i/y\u00edm\u0283i''' \"walk\" (with ''i'' in both stems) and '''b\u00e1\u0294a/y\u00edb\u0294a''' \"become, remain\" (with ''a'' in both stems).  The verb '''l\u00e1\u0294a/yil\u00e1:\u0294i''' \"find\" is unusual in having a mixture of a form I past and form III present (note also the variations '''l\u00ed\u0294i/y\u00edl\u0294a''' and '''l\u00e1\u0294a/y\u00edl\u0294a''').\n\nVerbs other than form I have consistent stem vowels.  All such verbs have ''a'' in the past (hence form stems with ''-\u00e9:-'', not ''-\u00ed:-'').  Forms V, VI, X and IIq have ''a'' in the present (indicated by boldface below); others have ''i''; forms VII, VIIt, and VIII have ''i'' in both vowels of the stem (indicated by italics below); form IX verbs, including \"defective\" verbs, behave as regular doubled verbs:\n* Form II: '''w\u00e1dda/yiw\u00e1ddi''' \"take away\"; '''\u0294\u00e1wwa/yi\u0294\u00e1wwi''' \"strengthen\"\n* Form III: '''n\u00e1:da/yin\u00e1:di''' \"call\"; '''d\u00e1:wa/yid\u00e1:wi''' \"treat, cure\"\n* Form IV (rare, classicized): '''\u0294\u00e1r\u1e0da/y\u00edr\u1e0di \"please, satisfy'''\n* '''Form V''': '''it\u0294\u00e1wwa/yit\u0294\u00e1wwa''' \"become strong\"\n* '''Form VI''': '''itd\u00e1:wa/yitd\u00e1:wa''' \"be treated, be cured\"\n* ''Form VII'' (rare in the Cairene dialect): '''in\u1e25\u00e1ka/yin\u1e25\u00edki''' \"be told\"\n* ''Form VIIt'': '''itn\u00e1sa/yitn\u00edsi''' \"be forgotten\"\n* ''Form VIII'': '''i\u0283t\u00e1ra/yi\u0283t\u00edri''' \"buy\"\n* '''Form IX''' (very rare): '''i\u1e25l\u00e1ww/yi\u1e25l\u00e1ww''' \"be/become sweet\"\n* '''Form X''': '''ist\u00e1kfa/yist\u00e1kfa''' \"have enough\"\n* Form Iq: ''need example''\n* '''Form IIq''': ''need example''\n\n==== Hollow verbs ====\nHollow have a W or Y as the middle root consonant.

Like that class, it has two stems in the past, which are '''\u1e25abb\u00e9:-''' before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and '''\u1e25\u00e1bb-''' elsewhere (third person).  Note that ''\u00e9:-'' was borrowed from the defective verbs; the Classical Arabic equivalent form would be *'''\u1e25ab\u00e1b-''', e.g. *'''\u1e25ab\u00e1b-t'''.\n\nOther verbs have ''u'' or ''a'' in the present stem: '''ba\u1e63\u1e63/yib\u00fa\u1e63\u1e63''' \"to look\", '''\u1e63a\u1e25\u1e25/yi\u1e63\u00e1\u1e25\u1e25''' \"be right, be proper\".\n\nAs for the other forms:\n*Form II, V doubled verbs are strong: '''\u1e25\u00e1ddid/yi\u1e25\u00e1ddid''' \"limit, fix (appointment)\"\n*Form III, IV, VI, VIII doubled verbs seem non-existent\n*Form VII and VIIt doubled verbs (same stem vowel ''a'' in both stems): '''inb\u00e1ll/yinb\u00e1ll''' \"be wetted\", '''it\u0295\u00e1dd/yit\u0295\u00e1dd'''\n*Form VIII doubled verbs (same stem vowel ''a'' in both stems): '''iht\u00e1mm/yiht\u00e1mm''' \"be interested (in)\"\n*Form IX verbs (automatically behave as \"doubled\" verbs, same stem vowel ''a'' in both stems): '''i\u1e25m\u00e1rr/yi\u1e25m\u00e1rr''' \"be red, blush\", '''i\u1e25l\u00e1ww/yi\u1e25l\u00e1ww''' \"be sweet\"\n*Form X verbs '''''(stem vowel either ''a'' or ''i'' in non-past)''''': '''ista\u1e25\u00e1\u0294\u0294/yista\u1e25\u00e1\u0294\u0294''' \"deserve\" vs. '''ista\u0295\u00e1dd/yista\u0295\u00eddd''' \"be ready\", '''istam\u00e1rr/yistam\u00edrr''' \"continue\".\n\n==== Assimilated verbs ====\n\nAssimilated verbs have W or Y as the first root consonant.  Most of these verbs have been regularized in Egyptian Arabic, e.g. '''w\u00e1zan/y\u00edwzin''' \"to weigh\" or '''w\u00ed\u1e63\u00edl/y\u00edw\u1e63al''' \"to arrive\".  Only a couple of irregular verbs remain, e.g. '''w\u00ed\u0294if/y\u00fa\u0294af''' \"stop\" and '''w\u00ed\u0294i\u0295/y\u00fa\u0294a\u0295''' \"fall\" (see below).\n\n==== Doubly weak verbs ====\n\n\"Doubly weak\" verbs have more than one \"weakness\", typically a W or Y as both the second and third consonants.  This term is in fact a misnomer, as such verbs actually behave as normal defective verbs (e.g. '''k\u00e1wa/y\u00edkwi''' \"iron (clothes)\" from K-W-Y, '''\u0294\u00e1wwa/yi\u0294\u00e1wwi''' \"strengthen\" from \u0294-W-Y, '''d\u00e1:wa/yid\u00e1:wi''' \"treat, cure\" from D-W-Y).\n\n==== Irregular verbs ====\n\nThe irregular verbs are as follows:\n\n*'''\u00eddda/y\u00edddi''' \"give\" (endings like a normal defective verb)\n*'''w\u00ed\u0294if/y\u00fa\u0294af''' \"stop\" and '''w\u00ed\u0294i\u0295/y\u00fa\u0294a\u0295''' \"fall\" (''\u00e1\u0294af, b\u00e1\u0294af, \u1e25\u00e1\u0294af'' \"I (will) stop\"; \u00fa\u0294af \"stop!\")\n*'''kal/y\u00e1:kul''' \"eat\" and '''xad/y\u00e1:xud''' \"take\" (''kalt, kal, k\u00e1lit, k\u00e1lu'' \"I/he/she/they ate\", also regular ''\u00e1kal, etc.'' \"he/etc. ate\"; ''\u00e1:kul, b\u00e1:kul, \u1e25\u00e1:kul'' \"I (will) eat\", ''y\u00e1klu'' \"they eat\"; ''k\u00fal, k\u00fali, k\u00falu'' \"eat!\"; ''w\u00e1:kil'' \"eating\"; ''mitt\u00e1:kil'' \"eaten\")\n*'''g\u00e9/y\u00ed:gi''' \"come\".

Verb roots are indicated schematically using capital letters to stand for consonants in the root:\n*F = first consonant of root\n*M = middle consonant of three-consonant root\n*S = second consonant of four-consonant root\n*T = third consonant of four-consonant root\n*L = last consonant of root\nHence, the root F-M-L stands for all three-consonant roots, and F-S-T-L stands for all four-consonant roots. (Traditional Arabic grammar uses F-\u0295-L and F-\u0295-L-L, respectively, but the system used here appears in a number of grammars of spoken Arabic dialects and is probably less confusing for English speakers, since the forms are easier to pronounce than those involving ''\u0295''.)\n\nThe following table lists the prefixes and suffixes to be added to mark tense, person, number and gender, and the stem form to which they are added.  The forms involving a vowel-initial suffix, and corresponding stem <small>PA<sub>v</sub></small> or <small>NP<sub>v</sub></small>, are highlighted in silver.  The forms involving a consonant-initial suffix, and corresponding stem <small>PA<sub>c</sub></small>, are highlighted in gold.  The forms involving a no suffix, and corresponding stem <small>PA<sub>0</sub></small> or <small>NP<sub>0</sub></small>, are unhighlighted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  colspan=2|Tense/Mood\n!  colspan=2|Past\n!  colspan=2|Non-Past\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person\n!

In fact, participles and verbal nouns are the major sources for lexical items based on verbs, especially derived (i.e. non-Form-I) verbs.\n*Some verb classes do not have a regular verbal noun form; rather, the verbal noun varies from verb to verb.  Even in verb classes that do have a regular verbal noun form, there are exceptions.  In addition, some verbs share a verbal noun with a related verb from another class (in particular, many passive verbs use the corresponding active verb's verbal noun, which can be interpreted in either an active or passive sense).  Some verbs appear to lack a verbal noun entirely. (In such a case, a paraphrase would be used involving a clause beginning with ''inn''.)\n*Outside of Form I, passive participles as such are usually non-existent; instead, the active participle of the corresponding passive verb class (e.g. Forms V, VI, VIIt/VIIn for Forms II, III, I respectively) is used.  The exception is certain verbs in Forms VIII and X that contain a \"classicized\" passive participle that is formed in imitation of the corresponding participle in [[Classical Arabic]], e.g. ''mist\u00e1\u0295mil'' \"using\", ''must\u00e1\u0295mal'' \"used\".\n*Not all forms have a separate verb class for hollow or doubled roots.  When no such class is listed below, roots of that shape appear as strong verbs in the corresponding form, e.g. Form II strong verb ''\u1e0d\u00e1yya\u0295/yi\u1e0d\u00e1yya\u0295'' \"waste, lose\" related to Form I hollow verb ''\u1e0d\u00e1:\u0295/yi\u1e0d\u00ed:\u0295'' \"be lost\", both from root \u1e0c-Y-\u0295.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!  rowspan=5|Form\n!  rowspan=5|Root Type\n!  colspan=6|Stem\n!  colspan=2|Participle\n!  rowspan=5|Verbal Noun\n!  rowspan=5|Example\n|-\n!  style=background:silver|\n!  colspan=3|Past\n!  colspan=2 rowspan=2|Non-Past\n!  rowspan=4|Active\n!  rowspan=4|Passive\n|-\n! <small>Person of Suffix</small>\n!  1st/2nd\n!  colspan=2|3rd\n|-\n! <small>Suffix Type</small>\n!  <small>Cons-Initial</small>\n!  <small>None</small>\n!  <small>Vowel-Initial</small>\n!  <small>None</small>\n!  <small>Vowel-Initial</small>\n|-\n! <small>Suffix Name</small>\n!  style=background:gold|<small>PA<sub>c</sub></small>\n!  <small>PA<sub>0</sub></small>\n!  style=background:silver|<small>PA<sub>v</sub></small>\n!  <small>NP<sub>0</sub></small>\n!  style=background:silver|<small>NP<sub>v</sub></small>\n|-\n!  rowspan=6|I\n!  rowspan=6|Strong\n|  rowspan=6 style=background:silver|\n|  rowspan=3 colspan=3|FaMaL\n|  colspan=2|FMaL\n|  rowspan=6|F\u00e1:MiL\n|  rowspan=6|maFM\u00fa:L\n|  rowspan=6|(varies, e.g.<br /> FaML, FiML)\n|  '''f\u00e1ta\u1e25/y\u00edfta\u1e25''' \"open\"\n|-\n|  colspan=2|FMiL\n|  '''k\u00e1tab/y\u00edktib''' \"write\"\n|-\n|  colspan=2|FMuL\n|  '''d\u00e1xal/y\u00fadxul''' \"enter\"\n|-\n|  rowspan=3 colspan=2|FiMiL\n|  rowspan=3|''FiML''\n|  colspan=2|FMaL\n|  '''f\u00edhim/y\u00edfham''' \"understand\"\n|-\n|  colspan=2|FMiL\n|  '''m\u00edsik/y\u00edmsik''' \"hold, catch\"\n|-\n|  colspan=2|FMuL\n|  '''s\u00edkin/y\u00faskun''' \"reside\"\n|-\n!  rowspan=4|I\n!  rowspan=4|Defective\n|  rowspan=4 style=background:silver|\n|  rowspan=2|FaM\u00e9:\n|  rowspan=2|F\u00e1Ma\n|  rowspan=2|FaM\n|  FMa\n|  FM\n|  rowspan=4|F\u00e1:Mi\n|  rowspan=4|m\u00e1FMi\n|  rowspan=4|(varies, e.g.<br /> FaMy, m\u00e1FMa)\n|  '''b\u00e1\u0294a/y\u00edb\u0294a''' \"remain\"\n|-\n|  FMi\n|  FM\n|  '''r\u00e1ma/y\u00edrmi''' \"throw\"\n|-\n|  rowspan=2|FiM\u00ed:\n|  rowspan=2|F\u00edMi\n|  rowspan=2|F\u00edMy\n|  FMa\n|  FM\n|  '''n\u00edsi/y\u00ednsa''' \"forget\"\n|-\n|  FMi\n|  FM\n|  '''m\u00ed\u0283i/y\u00edm\u0283i''' \"walk\"\n|-\n!  rowspan=4|I\n!  rowspan=4|Hollow\n|  rowspan=4 style=background:silver|\n|  F\u00edL\n|  rowspan=4 colspan=2|F\u00e1:L\n|  colspan=2|F\u00ed:L\n|  rowspan=4|F\u00e1:yiL\n|  rowspan=4|(mitF\u00e1:L, properly<br />Form VIIt)\n|  rowspan=4|(varies, e.g.<br /> Fe:L, Fo:L)\n|  '''ga:b/yig\u00ed:b''' \"bring\"\n|-\n| F\u00faL\n|  colspan=2|F\u00fa:L\n|  '''\u0283a:f/yi\u0283\u00fa:f''' \"see\"\n|-\n| F\u00edL\n|  rowspan=2 colspan=2|F\u00e1:L\n|  '''na:m/yin\u00e1:m''' \"sleep\"\n|-\n| F\u00faL\n|  '''xa:f/yix\u00e1:f''' \"fear\"\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|I\n!  rowspan=2|Doubled\n|  rowspan=2 style=background:silver|\n|  rowspan=2|FaMM\u00e9:\n|  rowspan=2 colspan=2|F\u00e1MM\n|  colspan=2|F\u00edMM\n|  rowspan=2|F\u00e1:MiM\n|  rowspan=2|maFM\u00fa:M\n|  rowspan=2|(varies, e.g.<br /> FaMM, FuMM)\n|  '''\u1e25abb/yi\u1e25\u00edbb''' \"love\"\n|-\n| colspan=2|F\u00faMM\n|  '''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6d/yi\u1e25\u00fa\u1e6d\u1e6d''' \"put\"\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|II\n!  rowspan=2|Strong\n|  rowspan=2 style=background:silver|\n|  colspan=5|FaMMaL\n|  miF\u00e1MMaL\n|  rowspan=2 style=background:silver|\n|  rowspan=2|taFM\u00ed:L\n|  '''\u0263\u00e1yya\u1e5b/yi\u0263\u00e1yya\u1e5b''' \"change\"\n|-\n|  colspan=5|FaMMiL\n|  miF\u00e1MMiL\n|  '''d\u00e1rris/yid\u00e1rris''' \"teach\"\n|-\n!

However, {{IPA|/\u0283i/}} was more common in the past, as attested in [[Egyptian films of the 1940s|old films]].\n\nThe negative circumfix often surrounds the entire verbal composite including direct and indirect object pronouns:\n* {{IPA|/ma-katab-hum-\u02c8li\u02d0-\u0283/}}  \"he didn't write them to me\"\nHowever, verbs in the future tense typically instead use the prefix /mi\u0283/:\n* {{IPA|/mi\u0283-\u0127a-\u02c8jiktib/}} (or {{IPA|/ma-\u0127a-jik\u02c8tib\u0283/}}  \"he won't write\"\nInterrogative sentences can be formed by adding the negation [[clitic]] \"(mi\u0283)\" before the verb:\n* Past: {{IPA|/\u02c8katab/}} \"he wrote\"; {{IPA|/mi\u0283-\u02c8katab/}} \"didn't he write?\"\n* Present: {{IPA|/\u02c8jiktib/}} \"he writes\"; {{IPA|/mi\u0283-bi-\u02c8jiktib/}} \"doesn't he write?\"\n* Future: {{IPA|/\u0127a-\u02c8jiktib/}} \"he will write\"; {{IPA|/mi\u0283-\u0127a-\u02c8jiktib/}} \"won't he write?\"\nAddition of the circumfix can cause complex changes to the verbal cluster, due to the application of the rules of vowel syncope, shortening, lengthening, insertion and elision described above:\n* The addition of /ma-/ may trigger elision or syncope:\n**A vowel following /ma-/ is elided: (ixt\u00e1\u02d0r) \"he chose\" \u2192 ({{IPA|maxt\u00e1r\u0283}}).\n**A short vowel /i/ or /u/ in the first syllable may be deleted by syncope: (k\u00edbir) \"he grew\" \u2192 (makb\u00edr\u0283).\n* The addition of {{IPA|/-\u0283/}} may result in vowel shortening or epenthesis:\n** A final long vowel preceding a single consonant shortens: (ixt\u00e1\u02d0r) \"he chose\" \u2192 (maxt\u00e1r\u0283).\n** An unstressed epenthetic /i/ is inserted when the verbal complex ends in two consonants: /kunt/ \"I was\" \u2192 (mak\u00fanti\u0283).\n* In addition, the addition of {{IPA|/-\u0283/}} triggers a stress shift, which may in turn result in vowel shortening or lengthening:\n** The stress shifts to the syllable preceding {{IPA|/\u0283/}}: (k\u00e1tab) \"he wrote\" \u2192 (makat\u00e1b\u0283).\n** A long vowel in the previously stressed syllable shortens: (\u0283\u00e1\u02d0fit) \"she saw\" \u2192 (ma\u0283af\u00edt\u0283); (\u0283\u00e1:fu) \"they saw\" ''or'' \"he saw it\" \u2192 (ma\u0283af\u00fa:\u0283).\n** A final short vowel directly preceding {{IPA|/\u0283/}} lengthens: (\u0283\u00e1\u02d0fu) \"they saw\" ''or'' \"he saw it\" \u2192 (ma\u0283af\u00fa:\u0283).\n\nIn addition, certain other morphological changes occur:\n* (\u0283af\u00fa\u02d0) \"they saw him\" \u2192 (ma\u0283afuh\u00fa\u02d0\u0283) (to avoid a clash with (ma\u0283af\u00fa\u02d0\u0283) \"they didn't see/he didn't see him\").\n* (\u0283\u00e1\u02d0fik) \"He saw you (fem. sg.)\" \u2192 (ma\u0283afk\u00ed\u02d0\u0283).\n* (\u0283\u00faftik) \"I saw you (fem. sg.)\" \u2192 (ma\u0283uftik\u00ed\u02d0\u0283).\n\n== Syntax ==\nIn contrast with Classical Arabic, but much like the other [[varieties of Arabic]], Egyptian Arabic prefers [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO) [[word order]]; CA and to a lesser extent MSA prefer [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] (VSO). For example, in MSA \"Adel read the book\" would be {{lang|ar|\u0642\u0631\u0623\u064e \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Qara\u02bea \u02bf\u0100dilu l-kit\u0101b}}'' <!--MSA as pronounced by Egyptians:-->{{IPA-ar|\u02c8q\u0251\u027e\u0251\u0294\u0251 \u02c8\u0295\u00e6\u02d0del ol ke\u02c8t\u00e6\u02d0b|IPA}} whereas EA would say {{lang|arz|\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0642\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628}} ''{{transl|arz|\u0295\u0101dil \u0294ara l-kit\u0101b}}'' {{IPA-arz|\u02c8\u0295\u00e6\u02d0del \u02c8\u0294\u0251\u027e\u0251 lke\u02c8t\u00e6\u02d0b|IPA}}.\n\nAlso in common with other Arabic varieties is the loss of unique [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] in the dual form: while the dual remains productive to some degree in nouns, dual nouns are analyzed as plural for the purpose of agreement with verbs, demonstratives, and adjectives.

This is a feature characteristic of the [[#Coptic substratum|Coptic substratum of Egyptian Arabic]].\n\n== Coptic substratum ==\nEgyptian Arabic appears to have retained a significant [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[stratum (linguistics)|substratum]] in its [[lexicon]], [[phonology]], and [[syntax]]. Coptic is the latest stage of the indigenous [[Egyptian language]] spoken until the mid-17th century when it was finally completely supplanted among Egyptian Muslims and a majority of Copts by the Egyptian Arabic. Some features that Egyptian Arabic shares with the original ancient Egyptian language include certain prefix and suffix verbal conjugations, certain emphatic and glottalized consonants, as well as a large number of biliteral and triliteral lexical correspondences.\n\nTwo syntactic features that are particular{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}{{dubious|date=April 2015}} to Egyptian Arabic inherited from Coptic<ref>Nishio, 1996</ref> are:\n* postposed demonstratives \"this\" and \"that\" are placed ''after'' the noun.\n:Examples: {{IPA|/ir-r\u02e4a\u02d0\u0261il da/}} \"this man\" (lit. \"the man this\"; in Literary Arabic {{IPA|/ha\u02d0\u00f0a\u02d0 r-ra\u0261ul/}}) and {{IPA|/il-bitt di/}} \"this girl\" (lit. \"the girl this\"; in Literary Arabic {{IPA|/ha\u02d0\u00f0ihi l-bint/}}).\n\n* [[interrogative word|''Wh'' words]] (i.e. \"who\", \"when\", \"why\" [[wh-in-situ|remain]] in their \"logical\" positions in a sentence rather than being preposed, or moved to the front of the sentence, as in Literary Arabic or English).\n:Examples:\n** {{IPA|/r\u02e4a\u02d0\u0127 mas\u02e4rI \u0294imta/}} ({{lang|arz|\u0631\u0627\u062d \u0645\u0635\u0631 \u0625\u0645\u062a\u0627\u061f}}) \"When ({{IPA|/\u0294imta/}}) did he go to Egypt?\" (lit. \"He went to Egypt when?\")\n** {{IPA|/r\u02e4a\u02d0\u0127 mas\u02e4rI le\u02d0h/}} ({{lang|arz|\u0631\u0627\u062d \u0645\u0635\u0631 \u0644\u064a\u0647\u061f}}) \"Why ({{IPA|/le\u02d0h/}}) did he go to Egypt?

(see [[Egyptian Arabic phonology#Consonants|consonants]])\n\n== Sociolinguistic features ==\nEgyptian Arabic is used in most social situations, with Modern Standard and Classical Arabic generally being used only in writing and in highly-religious and/or formal situations. However, within Egyptian Arabic, there is a wide range of variation. [[El-Said Badawi]] identifies three distinct levels of Egyptian Arabic based chiefly on the quantity of non-Arabic lexical items in the vocabulary: ''\u02bf\u0100mmiyyat al-Musaqqaf\u012bn'' (Cultured Colloquial or [[Formal Spoken Arabic]]), ''\u02bf\u0100mmiyyat al-Mutanawwir\u012bn'' (Enlightened or Literate Colloquial), and ''\u02bf\u0100mmiyyat al-'Ummiy\u012bn'' (Illiterate Colloquial).<ref name=\"Badawi Hinds Dictionary\">{{cite book|last1=Badawi|first1=El-Said|last2=Hinds|first2=Martin|authorlink1=El-Said Badawi|authorlink2=Martin Hinds|title=A Dictionary of Egyptian Arabic|date=1986|publisher=Libraire du Liban|isbn=978-1-85341-003-1|pages=VII\u2013X}}</ref> Cultured Colloquial/Formal Spoken Arabic is characteristic of the educated classes and is the language of discussion of high-level subjects, but it is still Egyptian Arabic; it is characterized by use of technical terms imported from foreign languages and MSA and closer attention to the pronunciation of certain letters (particularly ''[[\u0642|q\u0101f]]''). It is relatively standardized and, being closer to the standard, it is understood fairly well across the Arab world.<ref name=\"Badawi Hinds Dictionary\" /> On the opposite end of the spectrum, Illiterate Colloquial, common to rural areas and to working-class neighborhoods in the cities, has an almost-exclusively Arabic vocabulary; the few loanwords generally are very old borrowings (e.g. {{lang|arz|\u062c\u0645\u0628\u0631\u0649}} ''{{transl|arz|gambari}}'', {{IPA|[\u0261\u00e6m\u02c8b\u00e6\u027ei]}} \"[[shrimp]]\", from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''gamberi'', \"shrimp\" (pl.)) or refer to technological items that find no or poor equivalents in Arabic (e.g. {{lang|arz|\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0632\u064a\u0648\u0646}} ''{{transl|arz|tel(e)vezy\u014dn/tel(e)fezy\u014dn}}'' {{IPA|[tel(e)vez\u02c8jo\u02d0n, tel(e)fez\u02c8jo\u02d0n]}}, [[television]]).<ref name=\"Badawi Hinds Dictionary\" /> Enlightened Colloquial (''\u02bf\u0100mmiyyat al-Mutanawwir\u012bn'') is the language of those who have had some schooling and are relatively affluent; loanwords tend to refer to items of popular culture, consumer products, and fashions. It is also understood widely in the Arab world, as it is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Egyptian cinema]] and television.<ref name=\"Badawi Hinds Dictionary\" />\n\nIn contrast to MSA and most other varieties of Arabic, Egyptian Arabic has a form of the [[T-V distinction]]. In the singular, {{lang|arz|\u0627\u0646\u062a}} ''enta''/''enti'' is acceptable in most situations, but to address clear social superiors (e.g. older persons, superiors at work, certain government officials), the form {{lang|arz|\u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a\u0643}} ''{{transl|arz|\u1e25a\u1e0dretak/\u1e25a\u1e0dretek}}'', meaning \"Your [[Grace (style)|Grace]]\" is preferred (compare [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''[[Spanish pronouns#The use of vusted and vuestra merced|usted]]'').\n\nThis use of ''{{transl|arz|\u1e25a\u1e0dretak/\u1e25a\u1e0dretek}}'' is linked to the system of [[honorifics]] in daily Egyptian speech.

The ones that are most frequently noted in popular discourse are the use of the word ''[[falafel]]'' as opposed to ''\u1e6da`meyya'' for the fava-bean fritters common across the country and the pronunciation of the word for the [[Egyptian pound]] as {{IPA-arz|\u02c8\u0261eni|}}, rather than the Cairene {{IPA-arz|\u0261e\u02c8ne\u02d0|}} (closer to the pronunciation of the origin of the term, the British [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]]). The speech of the older Alexandrian families is also noted for use of the first-person plural even when they speak in the singular.\n\n=== Port Said ===\n[[Port Said]]'s dialect (East Delta) is noted for a \"heavier\", more guttural sound, compared to other regions of the country.\n\n== Study ==\nEgyptian Arabic has been a subject of study by scholars and laypersons in the past and the present for many reasons, including personal interest, [[egyptomania]], business, news reporting, and diplomatic and political interactions. Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA) is now a field of study in both graduate and undergraduate levels in many higher education institutions and universities in the world. When added to academic instruction, Arabic\n-language schools and university programs provide Egyptian Arabic courses in a classroom fashion, and others facilitate classes for online study.\n\n== Sample text ==\n'''Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'''\n\n'''Egyptian'''/'''Masri''' (Arabic script; spelling not standardised):\n<blockquote>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\n{{lang|arz|\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0649 \u0644\u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646, \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0649}}\n<br />\n{{lang|arz|\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0649 \u0644\u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0649\n\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0649 \u0627\u062f\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u062d\u0631\u0651\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0645\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642. \u0627\u062a\u0648\u0647\u0628\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0636\u0645\u064a\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0631\u0648\u0636 \u064a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0648 \u0628\u0639\u0636\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u0648\u064a\u0629.}}\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n\nFranco/[[Arabic Chat Alphabet]] (has no strict standard):\n<blockquote>\nel e3lan el 3alami le 72u2 el ensan, el band el awalani\n<br />\nel bani2admin kollohom mawlodin 7orrin we metsawyin fel karama wel 7o2u2.

Arabic was also a minority language of some residents of the Nile Valley such as [[Qift]] in Upper Egypt through pre-Islamic trade with [[Nabateans]] in the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and the easternmost part of the [[Nile Delta]]. Egyptian Arabic seems to have begun taking shape in [[Fustat]], the first Islamic capital of Egypt, now part of [[Cairo]].\n\nOne of the earliest linguistic sketches of Cairene Arabic is a 16th-century document entitled ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Daf\u02bf al-\u02bei\u1e63r \u02bfan kal\u0101m ahl Mi\u1e63r}}'' ([https://www.academia.edu/39310493/Edition_of_Daf_al-Isr_%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%B9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B5%D8%B1_%D8%B9%D9%86_%D9%83%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85_%D8%A3%D9%87%D9%84_%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1]{{lang|ar|\u062f\u0641\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0635\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u0623\u0647\u0644 \u0645\u0635\u0631}}, \"The Removal of the Burden from the Language of the People of Cairo\") by [[Yusuf al-Maghribi]] ({{lang|ar|\u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u063a\u0631\u0628\u064a}}). With Misr here meaning Cairo. It contains key information on early Cairene Arabic and the language situation in [[Egypt in the Middle Ages]]. The main purpose of the document was to show that while the Cairenes' vernacular contained many critical \"errors\" vis-\u00e0-vis Classical Arabic, according to al-Maghribi, it was also related to Arabic in other respects. With many waves of immigration from the Arabian peninsula such as the [[Banu Hilal]] exodus, together with the ongoing [[Islamization]] and [[Arabization]] of the country, multiple Arabic varieties, one of which is Egyptian Arabic, slowly supplanted spoken Coptic. Local chroniclers mention the continued use of Coptic as a spoken language until the 17th century by peasant women in [[Upper Egypt]]. Coptic is still the [[liturgical language]] of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]].\n\n== Official status ==\nEgyptian Arabic has no official status and is not officially recognized as a language. [[Modern Standard Arabic]], a modernized form of [[Classical Arabic]] (also called Qur'anic Arabic), is the official language of Egypt (see [[diglossia]]). Interest in the local [[vernacular]] began in the 1800s, as the Egyptian national movement for [[self-determination]] was taking shape. For many decades to follow, questions about the reform and the modernization of Arabic were hotly debated in Egyptian intellectual circles. Proposals ranged from developing [[neologism]]s to replace archaic terminology in Modern Standard Arabic to the simplification of syntactical and morphological rules and the introduction of [[colloquialism]]s to even complete \"Egyptianization\" (''tam\u1e63\u012br'') by abandoning the so-called Modern Standard Arabic in favor of Masri or Egyptian Arabic.<ref name=\"Gershoni\">{{Cite book|author=Gershoni, I., J. Jankowski. |title=Egypt, Islam, and the Arabs |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford |year=1987}}</ref>\n\nProponents of language reform in Egypt included [[Qasim Amin]], who also wrote the first Egyptian feminist treatise, former President of the [[Cairo University|Egyptian University]], [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], and noted intellectual [[Salama Moussa]]. They adopted a modernist, [[secular]] approach and disagreed with the assumption that Arabic was an immutable language because of its association with the [[Qur'an]]. The first modern Egyptian novel in which the dialogue was written in the vernacular was [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]]'s [[Zaynab (novel)|''Zaynab'']] in 1913. It was inly in 1966 that [[Ali Moustafa Mosharafa|Mustafa Musharafa]]'s ''Kantara Who Disbelieved'' was released, the first novel to be written entirely in Egyptian Arabic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/18/62/50815/Books/Review/Book-Review-First-novel-written-in-colloquial-Arab.aspx|title=Book Review: First novel written in colloquial Arabic republished \u2013 Review \u2013 Books \u2013 Ahram Online|publisher=}}</ref> Other notable novelists, such as [[Ihsan Abdel Quddous]] and [[Yusuf Idris]], and poets, such as [[Salah Jahin]], [[Abdel Rahman el-Abnudi]] and [[Ahmed Fouad Negm]], helped solidify vernacular literature as a distinct literary genre.<ref name=\"Gershoni\" />\n\nAmongst certain groups within Egypt's elite, Egyptian Arabic enjoyed a brief period of rich literary output. That dwindled with the rise of Egyptian [[Arab nationalism]], which had gained wide popularity in Egypt by the final years of the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]], as demonstrated vividly by Egypt's involvement in the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]] under King [[Farouk of Egypt]]. The [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]], led by [[Mohammed Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], further enhanced the significance of Arab nationalism, making it a central element of Egyptian state policy. The importance of Modern Standard Arabic was reemphasised in the public sphere by the revolutionary government, and efforts to accord any formal language status to the Egyptian vernacular were ignored. Egyptian Arabic was identified as a mere dialect, one that was not spoken even in all of Egypt, as almost all of [[Upper Egypt]] speaks [[Sa'idi Arabic]]. Though the revolutionary government heavily sponsored the use of the Egyptian vernacular in films, plays, television programmes, and music, the prerevolutionary use of Modern Standard Arabic in official publications was retained.\n\nLinguistic commentators have noted the multi-faceted approach of the Egyptian revolutionaries towards the Arabic language. Whereas Egypt's first [[president of Egypt|president]], Mohammed Naguib exhibited a preference for using Modern Standard Arabic in his public speeches, his successor, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] was renowned for using the vernacular and for punctuating his speeches with traditional Egyptian words and expressions. Conversely, Modern Standard Arabic was the norm for state news outlets, including newspapers, magazines, television, and radio. That was especially true of Egypt's national broadcasting company, the [[ERTU|Arab Radio and Television Union]], which was established with the intent of providing content for the entire [[Arab world]], not merely Egypt, hence the need to broadcast in the standard, rather than the vernacular, language. The [[Voice of the Arabs]] radio station, in particular, had an audience from across the region, and the use of anything other than Modern Standard Arabic was viewed as eminently incongruous.\n\nAs the status of Egyptian Arabic as opposed to [[Classical Arabic]] can have such political and religious implications in Egypt, the question of whether Egyptian Arabic should be considered a [[Dialect#\"Dialect\" or \"language\"|\"dialect\" or \"language\"]] can be a source of debate. In [[sociolinguistics]], Egyptian Arabic can be seen as one of many distinct [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] that, despite arguably being languages on ''[[Abstand and ausbau languages|abstand]]'' grounds, are united by a common ''[[abstand and ausbau languages#Roofing|dachsprache]]'' in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).\n\n== Publications ==\nDuring the early 1900s many portions of the Bible were published in Egyptian Arabic.  These were published by the Nile Mission Press.  By 1932 the whole New Testament and some books of the Old Testament had been published in Egyptian Arabic in Arabic script.\n\n== Spoken varieties ==\n[[Sa'idi Arabic|Sa\u2018\u012bdi Arabic]] is a different variety than Egyptian Arabic in [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aec Ethnologue.com] and [http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/documentation.asp?id=aec ISO 639-3] and in other sources,<ref>David Dalby, 1999/2000, ''The Linguasphere Register'', The Linguasphere Observatory<br />William Bright, 1992, ''The International Encyclopedia of Linguistics'', Oxford.</ref> and the two varieties have limited [[mutual intelligibility]]. It carries little prestige nationally but continues to be widely spoken, with 19,000,000 speakers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aec|title=Arabic, Sa'idi Spoken|publisher=}}</ref> including in the north by rural migrants who have adapted partially to Egyptian Arabic. For example, the Sa\u2018\u012bdi genitive exponent is usually replaced with Egyptian ''{{transl|arz|bit\u0101\u02bf&nbsp;}}'', but the realization of {{IPAslink|\u0294}} as {{IPAblink|\u0261}} is retained.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Second-and third-generation migrants are [[monolingual]] in Egyptian Arabic but maintain cultural and familial ties to the south.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nThe traditional division between [[Upper and Lower Egypt]] and their respective differences go back to ancient times. Egyptians today commonly call the people of the north '''{{transl|arz|ba\u1e25arwa}}''' ({{IPA|[b\u0251\u02c8\u0127\u0251\u027ew\u0251]}}) and those of the south '''{{transl|arz|\u1e63a\u02bfayda}}''' ({{IPA|[s\u02e4\u0251\u02c8\u0295\u0251jd\u0251]}}). The differences throughout Egypt, however, are more wide-ranging and do not neatly correspond to the simple division. The language shifts from the eastern to the western parts of the [[Nile Delta]], and the varieties spoken from [[Giza]] to [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] are further grouped into a Middle Egypt cluster. Despite the differences, there are features distinguishing all the Egyptian Arabic varieties of the Nile Valley from any other varieties of Arabic. Such features include [[vowel reduction|reduction of long vowels]] in open and unstressed syllables, the postposition of demonstratives and interrogatives, the modal meaning of the imperfect and the integration of the participle.<ref>Versteegh, p. 162</ref>\n\nThe [[Libyan Arabic|Western Egyptian Bedawi Arabic]] variety<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ayl|title=Arabic, Libyan Spoken|publisher=}}</ref> of the western desert differs from all other Arabic varieties in Egypt in that it linguistically is part of [[Maghrebi Arabic]].<ref>David Dalby, 1999/2000, ''The Linguasphere Register'', The Linguasphere Observatory</ref> The same was formerly true of the Egyptian form of [[Judeo-Arabic languages|Judaeo-Arabic]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} [[Northwest Arabian Arabic]] is also distinct from Egyptian Arabic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=avl|title=Arabic, Eastern Egyptian Bedawi Spoken|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{Main|Egyptian Arabic phonology}}\nEgyptian Arabic has a phonology that differs slightly from that of other varieties of Arabic and has its own inventory of consonants and vowels.\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n=== Nouns ===\nIn contrast to CA and MSA, nouns are not inflected for case and lack [[nunation]] (with the exception of certain fixed phrases in the accusative case, such as {{lang|ar|\u0634\u0643\u0631\u0627\u064b}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0283ok\u027e\u0251n]}}, \"thank you\"). As all nouns take their [[pausal pronunciation|pausal]] forms, singular words and [[broken plural]]s simply lose their case endings. In sound plurals and dual forms, where, in MSA, difference in case is present even in pausal forms, the genitive/accusative form is the one preserved. Fixed expressions in the [[construct state]] beginning in ''abu'', often geographic names, retain their ''-u'' in all cases.<ref>See e.g. Behnstedt & Woidich (2005)</ref>\n\n==== Plurals ====\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Most common broken plural patterns\n!

Clitics can be attached to the following types of words:\n*A clitic pronoun attached to a noun indicates possession: ''b\u00e9et'' \"house\", ''b\u00e9et-i'' \"my house\"; ''sikk\u00edina'' \"knife\", ''sikk\u00ednt-i'' \"my knife\";  ''\u0294\u00e1bb'' \"father\", ''\u0294ab\u00fau-ya'' \"my father\".  Note that the form of a pronoun may vary depending on the phonological form of the word being attached to (ending with a vowel or with one or two consonants), and the noun being attached to may also have a separate \"construct\" form before possessive clitic suffixes.\n*A clitic pronoun attached to a preposition indicates the object of the preposition:  ''minno'' \"from it (masculine object)\", ''\u0295aleyha'' \"on it (feminine object)\"\n*A clitic pronoun attached to a verb indicates the object of the verb: ''\u0283\u00faft'' \"I saw\", ''\u0283\u00faft-u'' \"I saw him\", ''\u0283uft-\u00e1ha'' \"I saw her\".\n\nWith verbs, indirect object clitic pronouns can be formed using the preposition ''li-'' plus a clitic.  Both direct and indirect object clitic pronouns can be attached to a single verb: ''ag\u00edib'' \"I bring\", ''ag\u00edb-hu'' \"I bring it\", ''agib-h\u00fau-lik'' \"I bring it to you\", ''m-agib-hu-lk\u00edi-\u0283'' \"I do not bring it to you\".\n\n=== Verbs ===\nVerbs in Arabic are based on a stem made up of three or four consonants. The set of consonants communicates the basic meaning of a verb. Changes to the vowels in between the consonants, along with prefixes and/or suffixes, specify grammatical functions such as tense, person, and number, in addition to changes in the meaning of the verb that embody grammatical concepts such as [[causative]], [[intensive]], [[passive voice|passive]] or [[reflexive verb|reflexive]].\n\nEach particular [[lexical verb]] is specified by two stems, one used for the past tense and one used for non-past tenses along with as [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]] moods. To the former stem, suffixes are added to mark the verb for person, number, and gender, while to the latter stem, a combination of prefixes and suffixes are added. (Very approximately, the prefixes specify the person and the suffixes indicate number and gender.) The third person masculine singular past tense form serves as the \"dictionary form\" used to identify a verb, similar to the [[infinitive]] in English (Arabic has no infinitive). For example, the verb meaning \"write\" is often specified as ''k\u00e1tab'', which actually means \"he wrote\".  In the paradigms below, a verb will be specified as ''k\u00e1tab/y\u00edktib'' (where ''k\u00e1tab'' means \"he wrote\" and ''y\u00edktib'' means \"he writes\"), indicating the past stem (''katab-'') and non-past stem (''-ktib-'', obtained by removing the prefix ''yi-'').\n\nThe verb classes in Arabic are formed along two axes.  One axis (described as \"form I\", \"form II\", etc.) is used to specify grammatical concepts such as [[causative]], [[intensive]], [[passive voice|passive]], or [[reflexive verb|reflexive]], and involves varying the stem form.  For example, from the root K-T-B \"write\" is derived form I '''k\u00e1tab/y\u00edktib''' \"write\", form II '''k\u00e1ttib/yik\u00e1ttib''' \"cause to write\", form III '''k\u00e1:tib/yik\u00e1:tib''' \"correspond\", etc.  The other axis is determined by the particular consonants making up the root.  For example, defective verbs have a W or Y as the last root consonant, which is often reflected in paradigms with an extra final vowel in the stem (e.g. '''r\u00e1ma/y\u00edrmi''' \"throw\" from R-M-Y); meanwhile, hollow verbs have a W or Y as the middle root consonant, and the stems of such verbs appear to have only two consonants (e.g. '''g\u00e1:b/yig\u00ed:b''' \"bring\" from G-Y-B).\n\n==== Strong verbs ====\nStrong verbs are those that have no \"weakness\" (e.g. W or Y) in the root consonants.\nEach verb has a given vowel pattern for Past (a or i) and Present (a or i or u). Combinations of each exist.\n\n===== Regular verbs, form I =====\n\nForm I verbs have a given vowel pattern for past ('''a''' or '''i''') and present ('''a''', '''i''' or '''u''').

The primary differences are:\n*The occurrence of ''i'' and ''a'' in the stems are reversed: ''i'' in the past, ''a'' in the non-past.\n*In the past, instead of the stems '''ram\u00e9:-''' and '''r\u00e1m-''', the verb has '''nis\u00ed:-''' (with a consonant-initial suffix) and '''n\u00edsy-''' (with a vowel initial suffix).  Note in particular the |y| in '''n\u00edsyit''' and '''n\u00edsyu''' as opposed to '''r\u00e1mit''' and '''r\u00e1mu'''.\n*Elision of ''i'' in '''nis\u00ed:-''' can occur, e.g. '''\u00e1na ns\u00ed:t''' \"I forgot\".\n*In the non-past, because the stem has ''a'' instead of ''i'', there is no homonymy between masculine '''t\u00ed-nsa, \u00ed-nsa''' and feminine '''t\u00ed-ns-i, \u00ed-ns-i'''.\n\nNote that some other verbs have different stem variations, e.g. '''m\u00ed\u0283i/y\u00edm\u0283i''' \"walk\" (with ''i'' in both stems) and '''b\u00e1\u0294a/y\u00edb\u0294a''' \"become, remain\" (with ''a'' in both stems).  The verb '''l\u00e1\u0294a/yil\u00e1:\u0294i''' \"find\" is unusual in having a mixture of a form I past and form III present (note also the variations '''l\u00ed\u0294i/y\u00edl\u0294a''' and '''l\u00e1\u0294a/y\u00edl\u0294a''').\n\nVerbs other than form I have consistent stem vowels.  All such verbs have ''a'' in the past (hence form stems with ''-\u00e9:-'', not ''-\u00ed:-'').  Forms V, VI, X and IIq have ''a'' in the present (indicated by boldface below); others have ''i''; forms VII, VIIt, and VIII have ''i'' in both vowels of the stem (indicated by italics below); form IX verbs, including \"defective\" verbs, behave as regular doubled verbs:\n* Form II: '''w\u00e1dda/yiw\u00e1ddi''' \"take away\"; '''\u0294\u00e1wwa/yi\u0294\u00e1wwi''' \"strengthen\"\n* Form III: '''n\u00e1:da/yin\u00e1:di''' \"call\"; '''d\u00e1:wa/yid\u00e1:wi''' \"treat, cure\"\n* Form IV (rare, classicized): '''\u0294\u00e1r\u1e0da/y\u00edr\u1e0di \"please, satisfy'''\n* '''Form V''': '''it\u0294\u00e1wwa/yit\u0294\u00e1wwa''' \"become strong\"\n* '''Form VI''': '''itd\u00e1:wa/yitd\u00e1:wa''' \"be treated, be cured\"\n* ''Form VII'' (rare in the Cairene dialect): '''in\u1e25\u00e1ka/yin\u1e25\u00edki''' \"be told\"\n* ''Form VIIt'': '''itn\u00e1sa/yitn\u00edsi''' \"be forgotten\"\n* ''Form VIII'': '''i\u0283t\u00e1ra/yi\u0283t\u00edri''' \"buy\"\n* '''Form IX''' (very rare): '''i\u1e25l\u00e1ww/yi\u1e25l\u00e1ww''' \"be/become sweet\"\n* '''Form X''': '''ist\u00e1kfa/yist\u00e1kfa''' \"have enough\"\n* Form Iq: ''need example''\n* '''Form IIq''': ''need example''\n\n==== Hollow verbs ====\nHollow have a W or Y as the middle root consonant.  Note that for some forms (e.g. form II and form III), hollow verbs are conjugated as strong verbs (e.g. form II ''\u0295\u00e1yyin/yi\u0295\u00e1yyin'' \"appoint\" from \u0295-Y-N, form III ''g\u00e1:wib/yig\u00e1:wib'' \"answer\" from G-W-B).\n\n===== Hollow verb, form I, f\u00e1:l/yif\u00ed:l =====\n\nExample: '''g\u00e1:b/yig\u00ed:b''' \"bring\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  colspan=2|Tense/mood\n!  colspan=2|Past\n!  colspan=2|Present subjunctive\n!  colspan=2|Present indicative\n!  colspan=2|Future\n!  colspan=2|Imperative\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person\n!

Like that class, it has two stems in the past, which are '''\u1e25abb\u00e9:-''' before consonant-initial suffixes (first and second person) and '''\u1e25\u00e1bb-''' elsewhere (third person).  Note that ''\u00e9:-'' was borrowed from the defective verbs; the Classical Arabic equivalent form would be *'''\u1e25ab\u00e1b-''', e.g. *'''\u1e25ab\u00e1b-t'''.\n\nOther verbs have ''u'' or ''a'' in the present stem: '''ba\u1e63\u1e63/yib\u00fa\u1e63\u1e63''' \"to look\", '''\u1e63a\u1e25\u1e25/yi\u1e63\u00e1\u1e25\u1e25''' \"be right, be proper\".\n\nAs for the other forms:\n*Form II, V doubled verbs are strong: '''\u1e25\u00e1ddid/yi\u1e25\u00e1ddid''' \"limit, fix (appointment)\"\n*Form III, IV, VI, VIII doubled verbs seem non-existent\n*Form VII and VIIt doubled verbs (same stem vowel ''a'' in both stems): '''inb\u00e1ll/yinb\u00e1ll''' \"be wetted\", '''it\u0295\u00e1dd/yit\u0295\u00e1dd'''\n*Form VIII doubled verbs (same stem vowel ''a'' in both stems): '''iht\u00e1mm/yiht\u00e1mm''' \"be interested (in)\"\n*Form IX verbs (automatically behave as \"doubled\" verbs, same stem vowel ''a'' in both stems): '''i\u1e25m\u00e1rr/yi\u1e25m\u00e1rr''' \"be red, blush\", '''i\u1e25l\u00e1ww/yi\u1e25l\u00e1ww''' \"be sweet\"\n*Form X verbs '''''(stem vowel either ''a'' or ''i'' in non-past)''''': '''ista\u1e25\u00e1\u0294\u0294/yista\u1e25\u00e1\u0294\u0294''' \"deserve\" vs. '''ista\u0295\u00e1dd/yista\u0295\u00eddd''' \"be ready\", '''istam\u00e1rr/yistam\u00edrr''' \"continue\".\n\n==== Assimilated verbs ====\n\nAssimilated verbs have W or Y as the first root consonant.  Most of these verbs have been regularized in Egyptian Arabic, e.g. '''w\u00e1zan/y\u00edwzin''' \"to weigh\" or '''w\u00ed\u1e63\u00edl/y\u00edw\u1e63al''' \"to arrive\".  Only a couple of irregular verbs remain, e.g. '''w\u00ed\u0294if/y\u00fa\u0294af''' \"stop\" and '''w\u00ed\u0294i\u0295/y\u00fa\u0294a\u0295''' \"fall\" (see below).\n\n==== Doubly weak verbs ====\n\n\"Doubly weak\" verbs have more than one \"weakness\", typically a W or Y as both the second and third consonants.  This term is in fact a misnomer, as such verbs actually behave as normal defective verbs (e.g. '''k\u00e1wa/y\u00edkwi''' \"iron (clothes)\" from K-W-Y, '''\u0294\u00e1wwa/yi\u0294\u00e1wwi''' \"strengthen\" from \u0294-W-Y, '''d\u00e1:wa/yid\u00e1:wi''' \"treat, cure\" from D-W-Y).\n\n==== Irregular verbs ====\n\nThe irregular verbs are as follows:\n\n*'''\u00eddda/y\u00edddi''' \"give\" (endings like a normal defective verb)\n*'''w\u00ed\u0294if/y\u00fa\u0294af''' \"stop\" and '''w\u00ed\u0294i\u0295/y\u00fa\u0294a\u0295''' \"fall\" (''\u00e1\u0294af, b\u00e1\u0294af, \u1e25\u00e1\u0294af'' \"I (will) stop\"; \u00fa\u0294af \"stop!\")\n*'''kal/y\u00e1:kul''' \"eat\" and '''xad/y\u00e1:xud''' \"take\" (''kalt, kal, k\u00e1lit, k\u00e1lu'' \"I/he/she/they ate\", also regular ''\u00e1kal, etc.'' \"he/etc. ate\"; ''\u00e1:kul, b\u00e1:kul, \u1e25\u00e1:kul'' \"I (will) eat\", ''y\u00e1klu'' \"they eat\"; ''k\u00fal, k\u00fali, k\u00falu'' \"eat!\"; ''w\u00e1:kil'' \"eating\"; ''mitt\u00e1:kil'' \"eaten\")\n*'''g\u00e9/y\u00ed:gi''' \"come\".

Verb roots are indicated schematically using capital letters to stand for consonants in the root:\n*F = first consonant of root\n*M = middle consonant of three-consonant root\n*S = second consonant of four-consonant root\n*T = third consonant of four-consonant root\n*L = last consonant of root\nHence, the root F-M-L stands for all three-consonant roots, and F-S-T-L stands for all four-consonant roots. (Traditional Arabic grammar uses F-\u0295-L and F-\u0295-L-L, respectively, but the system used here appears in a number of grammars of spoken Arabic dialects and is probably less confusing for English speakers, since the forms are easier to pronounce than those involving ''\u0295''.)\n\nThe following table lists the prefixes and suffixes to be added to mark tense, person, number and gender, and the stem form to which they are added.  The forms involving a vowel-initial suffix, and corresponding stem <small>PA<sub>v</sub></small> or <small>NP<sub>v</sub></small>, are highlighted in silver.  The forms involving a consonant-initial suffix, and corresponding stem <small>PA<sub>c</sub></small>, are highlighted in gold.  The forms involving a no suffix, and corresponding stem <small>PA<sub>0</sub></small> or <small>NP<sub>0</sub></small>, are unhighlighted.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!  colspan=2|Tense/Mood\n!  colspan=2|Past\n!  colspan=2|Non-Past\n|-\n!  colspan=2|Person\n!

In fact, participles and verbal nouns are the major sources for lexical items based on verbs, especially derived (i.e. non-Form-I) verbs.\n*Some verb classes do not have a regular verbal noun form; rather, the verbal noun varies from verb to verb.  Even in verb classes that do have a regular verbal noun form, there are exceptions.  In addition, some verbs share a verbal noun with a related verb from another class (in particular, many passive verbs use the corresponding active verb's verbal noun, which can be interpreted in either an active or passive sense).  Some verbs appear to lack a verbal noun entirely. (In such a case, a paraphrase would be used involving a clause beginning with ''inn''.)\n*Outside of Form I, passive participles as such are usually non-existent; instead, the active participle of the corresponding passive verb class (e.g. Forms V, VI, VIIt/VIIn for Forms II, III, I respectively) is used.  The exception is certain verbs in Forms VIII and X that contain a \"classicized\" passive participle that is formed in imitation of the corresponding participle in [[Classical Arabic]], e.g. ''mist\u00e1\u0295mil'' \"using\", ''must\u00e1\u0295mal'' \"used\".\n*Not all forms have a separate verb class for hollow or doubled roots.  When no such class is listed below, roots of that shape appear as strong verbs in the corresponding form, e.g. Form II strong verb ''\u1e0d\u00e1yya\u0295/yi\u1e0d\u00e1yya\u0295'' \"waste, lose\" related to Form I hollow verb ''\u1e0d\u00e1:\u0295/yi\u1e0d\u00ed:\u0295'' \"be lost\", both from root \u1e0c-Y-\u0295.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!  rowspan=5|Form\n!  rowspan=5|Root Type\n!  colspan=6|Stem\n!  colspan=2|Participle\n!  rowspan=5|Verbal Noun\n!  rowspan=5|Example\n|-\n!  style=background:silver|\n!  colspan=3|Past\n!  colspan=2 rowspan=2|Non-Past\n!  rowspan=4|Active\n!  rowspan=4|Passive\n|-\n! <small>Person of Suffix</small>\n!  1st/2nd\n!  colspan=2|3rd\n|-\n! <small>Suffix Type</small>\n!  <small>Cons-Initial</small>\n!  <small>None</small>\n!  <small>Vowel-Initial</small>\n!  <small>None</small>\n!  <small>Vowel-Initial</small>\n|-\n! <small>Suffix Name</small>\n!  style=background:gold|<small>PA<sub>c</sub></small>\n!  <small>PA<sub>0</sub></small>\n!  style=background:silver|<small>PA<sub>v</sub></small>\n!  <small>NP<sub>0</sub></small>\n!  style=background:silver|<small>NP<sub>v</sub></small>\n|-\n!  rowspan=6|I\n!  rowspan=6|Strong\n|  rowspan=6 style=background:silver|\n|  rowspan=3 colspan=3|FaMaL\n|  colspan=2|FMaL\n|  rowspan=6|F\u00e1:MiL\n|  rowspan=6|maFM\u00fa:L\n|  rowspan=6|(varies, e.g.<br /> FaML, FiML)\n|  '''f\u00e1ta\u1e25/y\u00edfta\u1e25''' \"open\"\n|-\n|  colspan=2|FMiL\n|  '''k\u00e1tab/y\u00edktib''' \"write\"\n|-\n|  colspan=2|FMuL\n|  '''d\u00e1xal/y\u00fadxul''' \"enter\"\n|-\n|  rowspan=3 colspan=2|FiMiL\n|  rowspan=3|''FiML''\n|  colspan=2|FMaL\n|  '''f\u00edhim/y\u00edfham''' \"understand\"\n|-\n|  colspan=2|FMiL\n|  '''m\u00edsik/y\u00edmsik''' \"hold, catch\"\n|-\n|  colspan=2|FMuL\n|  '''s\u00edkin/y\u00faskun''' \"reside\"\n|-\n!  rowspan=4|I\n!  rowspan=4|Defective\n|  rowspan=4 style=background:silver|\n|  rowspan=2|FaM\u00e9:\n|  rowspan=2|F\u00e1Ma\n|  rowspan=2|FaM\n|  FMa\n|  FM\n|  rowspan=4|F\u00e1:Mi\n|  rowspan=4|m\u00e1FMi\n|  rowspan=4|(varies, e.g.<br /> FaMy, m\u00e1FMa)\n|  '''b\u00e1\u0294a/y\u00edb\u0294a''' \"remain\"\n|-\n|  FMi\n|  FM\n|  '''r\u00e1ma/y\u00edrmi''' \"throw\"\n|-\n|  rowspan=2|FiM\u00ed:\n|  rowspan=2|F\u00edMi\n|  rowspan=2|F\u00edMy\n|  FMa\n|  FM\n|  '''n\u00edsi/y\u00ednsa''' \"forget\"\n|-\n|  FMi\n|  FM\n|  '''m\u00ed\u0283i/y\u00edm\u0283i''' \"walk\"\n|-\n!  rowspan=4|I\n!  rowspan=4|Hollow\n|  rowspan=4 style=background:silver|\n|  F\u00edL\n|  rowspan=4 colspan=2|F\u00e1:L\n|  colspan=2|F\u00ed:L\n|  rowspan=4|F\u00e1:yiL\n|  rowspan=4|(mitF\u00e1:L, properly<br />Form VIIt)\n|  rowspan=4|(varies, e.g.<br /> Fe:L, Fo:L)\n|  '''ga:b/yig\u00ed:b''' \"bring\"\n|-\n| F\u00faL\n|  colspan=2|F\u00fa:L\n|  '''\u0283a:f/yi\u0283\u00fa:f''' \"see\"\n|-\n| F\u00edL\n|  rowspan=2 colspan=2|F\u00e1:L\n|  '''na:m/yin\u00e1:m''' \"sleep\"\n|-\n| F\u00faL\n|  '''xa:f/yix\u00e1:f''' \"fear\"\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|I\n!  rowspan=2|Doubled\n|  rowspan=2 style=background:silver|\n|  rowspan=2|FaMM\u00e9:\n|  rowspan=2 colspan=2|F\u00e1MM\n|  colspan=2|F\u00edMM\n|  rowspan=2|F\u00e1:MiM\n|  rowspan=2|maFM\u00fa:M\n|  rowspan=2|(varies, e.g.<br /> FaMM, FuMM)\n|  '''\u1e25abb/yi\u1e25\u00edbb''' \"love\"\n|-\n| colspan=2|F\u00faMM\n|  '''\u1e25a\u1e6d\u1e6d/yi\u1e25\u00fa\u1e6d\u1e6d''' \"put\"\n|-\n!  rowspan=2|II\n!  rowspan=2|Strong\n|  rowspan=2 style=background:silver|\n|  colspan=5|FaMMaL\n|  miF\u00e1MMaL\n|  rowspan=2 style=background:silver|\n|  rowspan=2|taFM\u00ed:L\n|  '''\u0263\u00e1yya\u1e5b/yi\u0263\u00e1yya\u1e5b''' \"change\"\n|-\n|  colspan=5|FaMMiL\n|  miF\u00e1MMiL\n|  '''d\u00e1rris/yid\u00e1rris''' \"teach\"\n|-\n!

However, {{IPA|/\u0283i/}} was more common in the past, as attested in [[Egyptian films of the 1940s|old films]].\n\nThe negative circumfix often surrounds the entire verbal composite including direct and indirect object pronouns:\n* {{IPA|/ma-katab-hum-\u02c8li\u02d0-\u0283/}}  \"he didn't write them to me\"\nHowever, verbs in the future tense typically instead use the prefix /mi\u0283/:\n* {{IPA|/mi\u0283-\u0127a-\u02c8jiktib/}} (or {{IPA|/ma-\u0127a-jik\u02c8tib\u0283/}}  \"he won't write\"\nInterrogative sentences can be formed by adding the negation [[clitic]] \"(mi\u0283)\" before the verb:\n* Past: {{IPA|/\u02c8katab/}} \"he wrote\"; {{IPA|/mi\u0283-\u02c8katab/}} \"didn't he write?\"\n* Present: {{IPA|/\u02c8jiktib/}} \"he writes\"; {{IPA|/mi\u0283-bi-\u02c8jiktib/}} \"doesn't he write?\"\n* Future: {{IPA|/\u0127a-\u02c8jiktib/}} \"he will write\"; {{IPA|/mi\u0283-\u0127a-\u02c8jiktib/}} \"won't he write?\"\nAddition of the circumfix can cause complex changes to the verbal cluster, due to the application of the rules of vowel syncope, shortening, lengthening, insertion and elision described above:\n* The addition of /ma-/ may trigger elision or syncope:\n**A vowel following /ma-/ is elided: (ixt\u00e1\u02d0r) \"he chose\" \u2192 ({{IPA|maxt\u00e1r\u0283}}).\n**A short vowel /i/ or /u/ in the first syllable may be deleted by syncope: (k\u00edbir) \"he grew\" \u2192 (makb\u00edr\u0283).\n* The addition of {{IPA|/-\u0283/}} may result in vowel shortening or epenthesis:\n** A final long vowel preceding a single consonant shortens: (ixt\u00e1\u02d0r) \"he chose\" \u2192 (maxt\u00e1r\u0283).\n** An unstressed epenthetic /i/ is inserted when the verbal complex ends in two consonants: /kunt/ \"I was\" \u2192 (mak\u00fanti\u0283).\n* In addition, the addition of {{IPA|/-\u0283/}} triggers a stress shift, which may in turn result in vowel shortening or lengthening:\n** The stress shifts to the syllable preceding {{IPA|/\u0283/}}: (k\u00e1tab) \"he wrote\" \u2192 (makat\u00e1b\u0283).\n** A long vowel in the previously stressed syllable shortens: (\u0283\u00e1\u02d0fit) \"she saw\" \u2192 (ma\u0283af\u00edt\u0283); (\u0283\u00e1:fu) \"they saw\" ''or'' \"he saw it\" \u2192 (ma\u0283af\u00fa:\u0283).\n** A final short vowel directly preceding {{IPA|/\u0283/}} lengthens: (\u0283\u00e1\u02d0fu) \"they saw\" ''or'' \"he saw it\" \u2192 (ma\u0283af\u00fa:\u0283).\n\nIn addition, certain other morphological changes occur:\n* (\u0283af\u00fa\u02d0) \"they saw him\" \u2192 (ma\u0283afuh\u00fa\u02d0\u0283) (to avoid a clash with (ma\u0283af\u00fa\u02d0\u0283) \"they didn't see/he didn't see him\").\n* (\u0283\u00e1\u02d0fik) \"He saw you (fem. sg.)\" \u2192 (ma\u0283afk\u00ed\u02d0\u0283).\n* (\u0283\u00faftik) \"I saw you (fem. sg.)\" \u2192 (ma\u0283uftik\u00ed\u02d0\u0283).\n\n== Syntax ==\nIn contrast with Classical Arabic, but much like the other [[varieties of Arabic]], Egyptian Arabic prefers [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO) [[word order]]; CA and to a lesser extent MSA prefer [[verb\u2013subject\u2013object]] (VSO). For example, in MSA \"Adel read the book\" would be {{lang|ar|\u0642\u0631\u0623\u064e \u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Qara\u02bea \u02bf\u0100dilu l-kit\u0101b}}'' <!--MSA as pronounced by Egyptians:-->{{IPA-ar|\u02c8q\u0251\u027e\u0251\u0294\u0251 \u02c8\u0295\u00e6\u02d0del ol ke\u02c8t\u00e6\u02d0b|IPA}} whereas EA would say {{lang|arz|\u0639\u0627\u062f\u0644 \u0642\u0631\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628}} ''{{transl|arz|\u0295\u0101dil \u0294ara l-kit\u0101b}}'' {{IPA-arz|\u02c8\u0295\u00e6\u02d0del \u02c8\u0294\u0251\u027e\u0251 lke\u02c8t\u00e6\u02d0b|IPA}}.\n\nAlso in common with other Arabic varieties is the loss of unique [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] in the dual form: while the dual remains productive to some degree in nouns, dual nouns are analyzed as plural for the purpose of agreement with verbs, demonstratives, and adjectives.

This is a feature characteristic of the [[#Coptic substratum|Coptic substratum of Egyptian Arabic]].\n\n== Coptic substratum ==\nEgyptian Arabic appears to have retained a significant [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[stratum (linguistics)|substratum]] in its [[lexicon]], [[phonology]], and [[syntax]]. Coptic is the latest stage of the indigenous [[Egyptian language]] spoken until the mid-17th century when it was finally completely supplanted among Egyptian Muslims and a majority of Copts by the Egyptian Arabic. Some features that Egyptian Arabic shares with the original ancient Egyptian language include certain prefix and suffix verbal conjugations, certain emphatic and glottalized consonants, as well as a large number of biliteral and triliteral lexical correspondences.\n\nTwo syntactic features that are particular{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}{{dubious|date=April 2015}} to Egyptian Arabic inherited from Coptic<ref>Nishio, 1996</ref> are:\n* postposed demonstratives \"this\" and \"that\" are placed ''after'' the noun.\n:Examples: {{IPA|/ir-r\u02e4a\u02d0\u0261il da/}} \"this man\" (lit. \"the man this\"; in Literary Arabic {{IPA|/ha\u02d0\u00f0a\u02d0 r-ra\u0261ul/}}) and {{IPA|/il-bitt di/}} \"this girl\" (lit. \"the girl this\"; in Literary Arabic {{IPA|/ha\u02d0\u00f0ihi l-bint/}}).\n\n* [[interrogative word|''Wh'' words]] (i.e. \"who\", \"when\", \"why\" [[wh-in-situ|remain]] in their \"logical\" positions in a sentence rather than being preposed, or moved to the front of the sentence, as in Literary Arabic or English).\n:Examples:\n** {{IPA|/r\u02e4a\u02d0\u0127 mas\u02e4rI \u0294imta/}} ({{lang|arz|\u0631\u0627\u062d \u0645\u0635\u0631 \u0625\u0645\u062a\u0627\u061f}}) \"When ({{IPA|/\u0294imta/}}) did he go to Egypt?\" (lit. \"He went to Egypt when?\")\n** {{IPA|/r\u02e4a\u02d0\u0127 mas\u02e4rI le\u02d0h/}} ({{lang|arz|\u0631\u0627\u062d \u0645\u0635\u0631 \u0644\u064a\u0647\u061f}}) \"Why ({{IPA|/le\u02d0h/}}) did he go to Egypt?

(see [[Egyptian Arabic phonology#Consonants|consonants]])\n\n== Sociolinguistic features ==\nEgyptian Arabic is used in most social situations, with Modern Standard and Classical Arabic generally being used only in writing and in highly-religious and/or formal situations. However, within Egyptian Arabic, there is a wide range of variation. [[El-Said Badawi]] identifies three distinct levels of Egyptian Arabic based chiefly on the quantity of non-Arabic lexical items in the vocabulary: ''\u02bf\u0100mmiyyat al-Musaqqaf\u012bn'' (Cultured Colloquial or [[Formal Spoken Arabic]]), ''\u02bf\u0100mmiyyat al-Mutanawwir\u012bn'' (Enlightened or Literate Colloquial), and ''\u02bf\u0100mmiyyat al-'Ummiy\u012bn'' (Illiterate Colloquial).<ref name=\"Badawi Hinds Dictionary\">{{cite book|last1=Badawi|first1=El-Said|last2=Hinds|first2=Martin|authorlink1=El-Said Badawi|authorlink2=Martin Hinds|title=A Dictionary of Egyptian Arabic|date=1986|publisher=Libraire du Liban|isbn=978-1-85341-003-1|pages=VII\u2013X}}</ref> Cultured Colloquial/Formal Spoken Arabic is characteristic of the educated classes and is the language of discussion of high-level subjects, but it is still Egyptian Arabic; it is characterized by use of technical terms imported from foreign languages and MSA and closer attention to the pronunciation of certain letters (particularly ''[[\u0642|q\u0101f]]''). It is relatively standardized and, being closer to the standard, it is understood fairly well across the Arab world.<ref name=\"Badawi Hinds Dictionary\" /> On the opposite end of the spectrum, Illiterate Colloquial, common to rural areas and to working-class neighborhoods in the cities, has an almost-exclusively Arabic vocabulary; the few loanwords generally are very old borrowings (e.g. {{lang|arz|\u062c\u0645\u0628\u0631\u0649}} ''{{transl|arz|gambari}}'', {{IPA|[\u0261\u00e6m\u02c8b\u00e6\u027ei]}} \"[[shrimp]]\", from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''gamberi'', \"shrimp\" (pl.)) or refer to technological items that find no or poor equivalents in Arabic (e.g. {{lang|arz|\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0632\u064a\u0648\u0646}} ''{{transl|arz|tel(e)vezy\u014dn/tel(e)fezy\u014dn}}'' {{IPA|[tel(e)vez\u02c8jo\u02d0n, tel(e)fez\u02c8jo\u02d0n]}}, [[television]]).<ref name=\"Badawi Hinds Dictionary\" /> Enlightened Colloquial (''\u02bf\u0100mmiyyat al-Mutanawwir\u012bn'') is the language of those who have had some schooling and are relatively affluent; loanwords tend to refer to items of popular culture, consumer products, and fashions. It is also understood widely in the Arab world, as it is the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Egyptian cinema]] and television.<ref name=\"Badawi Hinds Dictionary\" />\n\nIn contrast to MSA and most other varieties of Arabic, Egyptian Arabic has a form of the [[T-V distinction]]. In the singular, {{lang|arz|\u0627\u0646\u062a}} ''enta''/''enti'' is acceptable in most situations, but to address clear social superiors (e.g. older persons, superiors at work, certain government officials), the form {{lang|arz|\u062d\u0636\u0631\u062a\u0643}} ''{{transl|arz|\u1e25a\u1e0dretak/\u1e25a\u1e0dretek}}'', meaning \"Your [[Grace (style)|Grace]]\" is preferred (compare [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''[[Spanish pronouns#The use of vusted and vuestra merced|usted]]'').\n\nThis use of ''{{transl|arz|\u1e25a\u1e0dretak/\u1e25a\u1e0dretek}}'' is linked to the system of [[honorifics]] in daily Egyptian speech.

The ones that are most frequently noted in popular discourse are the use of the word ''[[falafel]]'' as opposed to ''\u1e6da`meyya'' for the fava-bean fritters common across the country and the pronunciation of the word for the [[Egyptian pound]] as {{IPA-arz|\u02c8\u0261eni|}}, rather than the Cairene {{IPA-arz|\u0261e\u02c8ne\u02d0|}} (closer to the pronunciation of the origin of the term, the British [[guinea (British coin)|guinea]]). The speech of the older Alexandrian families is also noted for use of the first-person plural even when they speak in the singular.\n\n=== Port Said ===\n[[Port Said]]'s dialect (East Delta) is noted for a \"heavier\", more guttural sound, compared to other regions of the country.\n\n== Study ==\nEgyptian Arabic has been a subject of study by scholars and laypersons in the past and the present for many reasons, including personal interest, [[egyptomania]], business, news reporting, and diplomatic and political interactions. Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA) is now a field of study in both graduate and undergraduate levels in many higher education institutions and universities in the world. When added to academic instruction, Arabic\n-language schools and university programs provide Egyptian Arabic courses in a classroom fashion, and others facilitate classes for online study.\n\n== Sample text ==\n'''Article 1 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]'''\n\n'''Egyptian'''/'''Masri''' (Arabic script; spelling not standardised):\n<blockquote>\n<div dir=\"rtl\">\n{{lang|arz|\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0649 \u0644\u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646, \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0649}}\n<br />\n{{lang|arz|\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0649 \u0644\u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0648\u0644\u0627\u0646\u0649\n\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u0649 \u0627\u062f\u0645\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0648\u0644\u0648\u062f\u064a\u0646 \u062d\u0631\u0651\u064a\u0646 \u0648\u0645\u062a\u0633\u0627\u0648\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0641\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u0648\u0642. \u0627\u062a\u0648\u0647\u0628\u0644\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0644 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0636\u0645\u064a\u0631\u060c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0641\u0631\u0648\u0636 \u064a\u0639\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0648 \u0628\u0639\u0636\u064a\u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0631\u0648\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0627\u062e\u0648\u064a\u0629.}}\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n\nFranco/[[Arabic Chat Alphabet]] (has no strict standard):\n<blockquote>\nel e3lan el 3alami le 72u2 el ensan, el band el awalani\n<br />\nel bani2admin kollohom mawlodin 7orrin we metsawyin fel karama wel 7o2u2.

Once Radha (Vanisri), a famous stage artist and singer arrives who gets inspired to Gopi's natural talent of singing and playing flute and both of them fall in love. Before leaving Radha asks Gopi to accompany her so that flair can be flourish and also earn money. But Gopi says that music is a gift of God, he doesn't want to sell it, so, Radha decides to settle in the village along with him.

Meanwhile, Gopi fixes an alliance to Janaki, which is canceled due to a dowry problem. Then Gopi determines to earn money, hence he reaches the city where with the help of Radha, becomes a huge star, earns a lot and performs Janaki's marriage.

{"title_page": "Loneliness", "text_new": "{{short description|Complex and usually unpleasant emotional response to isolation}}\n{{Other uses}}\n[[File:Jean Jacques Henner - Solitude.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Solitude'', [[Jean-Jacques Henner]]]]\n{{emotion}}\n\n'''Loneliness''' is an unpleasant [[emotion]]al response to perceived [[Social isolation|isolation]]. Loneliness is also described as [[social pain]]\u2014a psychological mechanism which motivates individuals to seek social connections.  It is often associated with an unwanted lack of connection and intimacy.  Loneliness overlaps and yet is distinct from [[solitude]]. Solitude is simply the state of being apart from others, not everyone who experiences solitude feels lonely.  As a subjective emotion, loneliness can be felt even when surrounded by other people; one who feels lonely, is lonely.  The causes of loneliness are varied. They include social, mental, emotional, and environmental factors.\n\nThe lonely person in the world is Jonty Collins \n\nResearch has shown that loneliness is found throughout society, including among people in marriages along with other strong relationships, and those with successful careers.  Most people experience loneliness at some points in their lives, and some feel it very often. As a short term emotion, loneliness can be beneficial; it encourages the strengthening of relationships. Chronic loneliness on the other hand is widely considered harmful, with numerous reviews and meta-studies concluding it is a significant risk factor for poor mental and physical health outcomes.\n\nLoneliness has long been a theme in literature, going back to the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. Yet academic study of loneliness was sparse until the late twentieth century. In the 21st century, loneliness has been increasingly recognised as a social problem, with both NGOs and governmental actors seeking to tackle it.\n\n==Common causes==\nPeople can experience loneliness for many reasons, and many life events may cause it, such as a lack of [[friendship]] relations during [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]], or the physical absence of meaningful people around a person. At the same time, loneliness may be a symptom of another [[social]] or [[Psychology|psychological]] problem, such as [[Dysthymia|chronic depression]].\n\nMany people experience loneliness for the first time when they are left alone as [[infants]]. It is also a very common, though normally temporary, consequence of a [[Relationship breakup|breakup]], [[divorce]], or loss of any important [[long-term relationship]]. In these cases, it may stem both from the loss of a specific person and from the withdrawal from [[social circle]]s caused by the event or the associated sadness.\n\nThe loss of a significant person in one's life will typically initiate a [[grief|grief response]]; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while in the company of others. Loneliness may also occur after the birth of a [[child]] (often expressed in [[postpartum depression]]), after [[marriage]], or following any other socially disruptive event, such as moving from one's home town into an unfamiliar [[community]], leading to [[homesickness]]. Loneliness can occur within unstable [[marriages]] or other close [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] of a similar nature, in which feelings present may include [[anger]] or [[resentment]], or in which the feeling of [[love]] cannot be given or received. Loneliness may represent a dysfunction of [[Interpersonal communication|communication]], and can also result from places with low [[Population density|population densities]] in which there are comparatively few people to interact with.

This delineation was made in 1973 by Robert S. Weiss, in his seminal work: ''Loneliness: The Experience of Emotional and Social Isolation'' <ref name  = \"Weiss1973 \">Weiss, R.S. Loneliness: The Experience of Emotional and Social Isolation; The MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, USA, 1973.</ref> Based on Weiss's view that \"both types of loneliness have to be examined independently, because the satisfaction for the need of emotional loneliness cannot act as a counterbalance for social loneliness, and vice versa\", people working to treat or better understand loneliness have tended two treat these two types of loneliness separately, though this is far from always the case.<ref>''Loneliness at Universities: Determinants of Emotional and Social Loneliness among Students'' , Int.

Weiss tied his concept of emotional loneliness to [[attachment theory]]. People have a need for deep attachments, which can sometimes be fulfilled by close friends, but much more often by close family members such as parents, and later in life by romantic partners. In 1997, Enrico DiTommaso and Barry Spinner separated emotional loneliness into Romantic and Family loneliness.<ref name =\"Ami2015\"/> \n<ref name=\"journals.lww.com\">{{cite journal |last1=O'S\u00failleabh\u00e1in |first1=P\u00e1raic S. |last2=Gallagher |first2=Stephen |last3=Steptoe |first3=Andrew |title=Loneliness, Living Alone, and All-Cause Mortality: The Role of Emotional and Social Loneliness in the Elderly During 19 Years of Follow-Up |journal=Psychosomatic Medicine |date=2019 |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=521\u2013526 |doi=10.1097/PSY.0000000000000710 |url=https://journals.lww.com/psychosomaticmedicine/Fulltext/2019/07000/Loneliness,_Living_Alone,_and_All_Cause_Mortality_.6.aspx?WT.mc_id=HPxADx20100319xMP |accessdate=19 January 2020 |issn=0033-3174}}</ref>\nA 2019 study found that emotional loneliness significantly increased the likelihood of death for older adults living alone  (whereas there was no increase in mortality found with social loneliness).\n<ref name=\"journals.lww.com\"/>\n\n====Family loneliness====\nFamily loneliness results when  individuals feel they lack close ties with family members.

Psychologists have asserted that the formation of a committed romantic relationship is a critical development task for young adults. Though it is also one that many are delaying into their late 20s or beyond. People in romantic relationships tend to report less loneliness than single people, providing their relationship provides them with emotional intimacy. People in unstable or emotionally cold romantic partnerships can still feel romantic loneliness.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lesch|first=Elmien|last2=Casper|first2=Rozanne|last3=van der Watt|first3=Alberta S.

Further types of loneliness include ''existential'' loneliness, ''cosmic'' loneliness  - feeling alone in a hostile universe,  and ''cultural'' loneliness - typically found among immigrants who miss their home culture. <ref name = \"I&I\"/> These types are less well studied than the three fold separation into social, romantic and family loneliness, yet can be valuable in understanding the experience of certain sub groups suffering from loneliness.<ref name = \"Mijuskovic2012\">{{cite book\n | author =  Ben Lazare Mijuskovic \n | title = Loneliness in Philosophy, Psychology, and Literature\n | year = 2012\n | pages =60-69\n | publisher = [[iUniverse]]\n |ISBN = 978-1-4697-8934-7\n }}</ref> <ref name =\"Ami2015\"/>\n\n==Demarcation==\n\n===Feeling lonely vs. being socially isolated===\nThere is a clear distinction between feeling lonely and being [[social isolation|socially isolated]] (for example, a [[loner]]). In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]],<ref name=\"Peplau, L.A. 1982 pp. 1-18\">{{cite book|last1=Peplau|first1=L.A.|title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy|last2=Perlman|first2=D.|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1982|isbn=978-0-471-08028-2|editor1-last=Peplau|editor1-first=Letitia Anne|location=New York|pages=1\u201318|chapter=Perspectives on loneliness|editor2-last=Perlman|editor2-first=Daniel}}</ref> while [[solitude]] is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or in the middle of a crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own optimal level of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or [[over-stimulation]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Suedfeld |first1=P. |year=1989 |chapter=Past the reflection and through the looking-glass: Extending loneliness research |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Hojat |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Crandall |title=Loneliness: Theory, research and applications |pages=51\u20136 |location=Newbury Park, California |publisher=Sage Publications}}</ref>\n\nSolitude can have positive effects on individuals.

Chronic loneliness is more permanent and not easily relieved.<ref>Duck, S. (1992). Human relations (2nd ed.).  London: Sage Publications.</ref> For example, when a person is sick and cannot socialize with friends, this would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person with long term feelings of loneliness regardless of if they are at a family gathering or with friends is experiencing chronic loneliness. \n\n===Loneliness as a human condition===\nThe [[existentialist]] school of thought views loneliness as the essence of being [[human]]. Each human being comes into the world alone, travels through life as a separate person, and ultimately dies alone. Coping with this, accepting it, and learning how to direct our own lives with some degree of grace and satisfaction is the [[human condition]].<ref name=\"Exist\">''[http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/An%20Existential%20View%20Of%20Loneliness.htm An Existential View of Loneliness] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927060655/http://philosophicalsociety.com/Archives/An%20Existential%20View%20Of%20Loneliness.htm |date=27 September 2010 }}'' \u2013 Carter, Michele; excerpt from ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20111007024245/http://www.parkridgecenter.org/Page437.html Abiding Loneliness: An Existential Perspective]'', Park Ridge Center, September 2000</ref>\n\nSome [[philosopher]]s, such as [[Sartre]], believe in an epistemic loneliness in which loneliness is a fundamental part of the human condition because of the paradox between people's consciousness desiring [[Meaning of life|meaning in life]] and the isolation and nothingness of the [[universe]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tom\u0161ik |first1=Robert |title=Relationship of loneliness and meaning of life among adolescents.

Bost limns, \u201cAs a form of negative affect, loneliness shores up the alienation, isolation, and pathologization of black gay men during the 1980s and early 1990s.

Yet it remains challenging for scientists to make accurate generalisations and comparisons.

So without intervention, chronic loneliness can be self-reinforcing. <ref name =\"Masi2010\"/> <ref name =\"Ami2015\"/> <ref name =\"Rubenstein1982\"/>\n\n====Benefits====\nMuch has been written about the benefits of being alone, yet often, even when authors use the word \"loneliness\", they are referring to what could be more precisely described as voluntary solitude. Yet some assert that even long term involuntary loneliness can have beneficial effects. <ref name = \"virtues\">\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/03/the-virtues-of-isolation/521100/\n|title= The Virtues of Isolation\n|publisher= [[The Atlantic]]\n|date = March 2017\n|authors = Brent Crane\n|accessdate=5 April 2020}}\n</ref>  <ref name = \"Alberti2019\"/>\n\nChronic loneliness is often seen as a purely negative phenomena from the lens of social and medical science. Yet in spiritual and artistic traditions, it has been viewed as having mixed effects. Though even within these traditions, there can be warnings not to intentionally seek out chronic loneliness or other afflictions - just advise that if one falls into them, there can be benefits.  In western arts, there is a long belief that psychological hardship, including loneliness, can be a source of creativity.<ref name = \"Alberti2019\"/> In spiritual traditions, perhaps the most obvious benefit of loneliness is that in can increase the desire for a union with the divine. More esoterically, the psychic wound opened up by loneliness or other afflictions has been said, e.g. by [[Simone Weil]], to open up space for God to manifest within the soul.  In Christianity, [[spiritual dryness]] has been seen as advantageous as part of the [[Dark Night of the Soul|\"dark night of the soul\"]], an ordeal that while painful,  can result in spiritual transformation. From a secular perspective, while the vast majority of empirical studies focus on the negative effects of long term loneliness, a few studies have found there can also be benefits, such as enhanced perceptiveness of social situations. <ref name = \"Alberti2019\"/> <ref name = \"Only\">\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/03/the-virtues-of-isolation/521100/\n|title= Only the lonely\n|publisher= [[Aeon (digital magazine)|aeon]]\n|date = July 2016\n|authors = Cody Delistraty\n|accessdate=5 April 2020}}\n</ref>\n\n====Physical health====\nChronic loneliness can be a serious, life-threatening health condition.

Loneliness, to them, is a source of shame.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOlder people, specifically senior citizens also struggle with feelings of severe loneliness which lead them to considering or acting on thoughts of suicide or self harm. Retirement, poor health, loss of a significant other or other family or friends, all contribute to loneliness. The isolation leads to loneliness; the loneliness leads to self harm or suicidal thoughts or actions.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Suicides caused by loneliness in seniors can sometime be difficult to identify. Often they don't have anyone to disclose their feelings of loneliness and the despair it brings. They will stop eating, alter the doses of medications they should take, choose not to treat an illness leading as a way to help expedite death so they don't have to deal with feeling lonely.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nCultural influences can also cause loneliness leading to suicidal thoughts or actions. For example, Hispanic and Japanese cultures value interdependence. When a person from one of these cultures feels removed or feels they can't sustain relationships in their families or society they start to have negative behaviours which include negative thoughts or acting [[self-destructive]]ly. Other cultures, such as Caucasian have a culture that is more independent, culturally.While the cause of loneliness in a person may stem from different circumstances or cultural norms the impact lead to the same results, a desire to end life.\n\n==Physiological mechanisms link to poor health==\nThere are a number of potential physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes. In 2005, results from the American ''[[Framingham Heart Study]]'' demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of [[Interleukin 6|Interleukin 6 (IL-6)]], a blood chemical linked to [[heart disease]]. A 2006 study conducted by the ''Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience'' at the [[University of Chicago]] found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood pressure reading for adults over the age of fifty. Another finding, from a survey conducted by [[John Cacioppo]] from the [[University of Chicago]], is that doctors report providing better [[Health care|medical care]] to patients who have a strong network of family and friends than they do to patients who are alone. Cacioppo states that loneliness impairs [[cognition]] and [[will (philosophy)|willpower]], alters [[DNA]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in [[White blood cell|immune cells]], and leads over time to [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].<ref name=\"Science of Loneliness.com\">Cacioppo, John; [[William Patrick, author|Patrick, William]], ''Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection'', New York : W.W.

For some commentators, such as professor Ben Lazare Mijuskovic, ever since the dawn of civilization, it has been the single strongest motivator for human activity after essential physical needs are satisfied.  Loneliness is the first negative condition identified in the Holy Bible, with the [[Book of Genesis]] showing God creating a companion for man to relief loneliness. Nevertheless, there is relatively little direct record of explicit loneliness relief efforts prior to the 20th century. Some commentators including professor Rubin Gotesky have argued the sense of aloneness was rarely felt until older communal ways of living began to be disrupted by the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]. <ref name = \"Mijuskovic2012\"/><ref name = \"I&I\"/><ref name = \"Alberti2019\"/>\n\nStarting in the 1900s, and especially in the 21st century, efforts explicitly aiming to alleviate loneliness became much more common. Loneliness reduction efforts occur across multiple disciplines, often by actors for whom loneliness relief is not their primary concern.  For example, civic planning, the design of new housing developments, and university administration. Across the world, many departments and even entire NGO's dedicated to  loneliness relief have been established. For example in the UK, the ''Campaign to End Loneliness.'' <ref name =\"Masi2010\"/><ref name = \"EcoPH2018\"/> <ref name = \"Alberti2019\"/>\n\n===Medical treatment===\nTherapy is a common way of treating loneliness; for individuals whose loneliness is caused by factors that respond well to medical intervention, it is often successful. Short-term therapy, the most common form for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend [[group therapy]] as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.depression.com/psychotherapy.html |title=Psychotherapy |accessdate=29 March 2008 |work=Depression.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217142720/http://www.depression.com/psychotherapy.html |archive-date=17 December 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Doctors also frequently prescribe [[anti-depressants]] to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy.

Studies and surveys, as well as [[anecdotal evidence]] provided by volunteer and community organizations, indicate that the presence of animal companions such as [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, and [[guinea pig]]s can ease feelings of depression and loneliness among some sufferers. Beyond the companionship the animal itself provides there may also be increased opportunities for socializing with other pet owners.

Earlier dictionary definitions of loneliness equated it with solitude \u2013 a state that was often seen as positive, unless taken to excess. From about 1800, the word loneliness began to acquire its modern definition as a painful subjective condition. This may due to economic and social changes arising out the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Such as alienation and increased interpersonal competition, along with a reduction in the number of people that would enjoy close and enduring connections with the people living in close proximity with them, as may for example have been the case for modernising pastoral villages.<ref>{{cite book\n | author = [[Pankaj Mishra]]\n | title = [[Age of Anger]]\n | year = 2017\n | pages = 75, 172, 187\u2013188, 269\u2013270, 336\u2013338\n | publisher = [[Penguin Books]]\n |ISBN = 9780141984087\n }}</ref>\n<ref name = \"Alberti2019\">{{cite book\n | author = [[Fay Bound Alberti]]\n | title = A Biography of Loneliness: The History of an Emotion\n | year = 2019\n | pages = 1\u201340, 61\u201383\n | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n |ISBN = 9780198811343\n }}</ref>\nDespite growing awareness of the problem of loneliness, widespread social recognition of the problem was limited, and scientific study remained sparse, until the last quarter of the twentieth century.

Loneliness is also described as [[social pain]]\u2014a psychological mechanism which motivates individuals to seek social connections.  It is often associated with an unwanted lack of connection and intimacy.  Loneliness overlaps and yet is distinct from [[solitude]]. Solitude is simply the state of being apart from others, not everyone who experiences solitude feels lonely.  As a subjective emotion, loneliness can be felt even when surrounded by other people; one who feels lonely, is lonely.  The causes of loneliness are varied. They include social, mental, emotional, and environmental factors.\n\nResearch has shown that loneliness is found throughout society, including among people in marriages along with other strong relationships, and those with successful careers.  Most people experience loneliness at some points in their lives, and some feel it very often. As a short term emotion, loneliness can be beneficial; it encourages the strengthening of relationships. Chronic loneliness on the other hand is widely considered harmful, with numerous reviews and meta-studies concluding it is a significant risk factor for poor mental and physical health outcomes.\n\nLoneliness has long been a theme in literature, going back to the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]. Yet academic study of loneliness was sparse until the late twentieth century. In the 21st century, loneliness has been increasingly recognised as a social problem, with both NGOs and governmental actors seeking to tackle it.\n\n==Common causes==\nPeople can experience loneliness for many reasons, and many life events may cause it, such as a lack of [[friendship]] relations during [[childhood]] and [[adolescence]], or the physical absence of meaningful people around a person. At the same time, loneliness may be a symptom of another [[social]] or [[Psychology|psychological]] problem, such as [[Dysthymia|chronic depression]].\n\nMany people experience loneliness for the first time when they are left alone as [[infants]]. It is also a very common, though normally temporary, consequence of a [[Relationship breakup|breakup]], [[divorce]], or loss of any important [[long-term relationship]]. In these cases, it may stem both from the loss of a specific person and from the withdrawal from [[social circle]]s caused by the event or the associated sadness.\n\nThe loss of a significant person in one's life will typically initiate a [[grief|grief response]]; in this situation, one might feel lonely, even while in the company of others. Loneliness may also occur after the birth of a [[child]] (often expressed in [[postpartum depression]]), after [[marriage]], or following any other socially disruptive event, such as moving from one's home town into an unfamiliar [[community]], leading to [[homesickness]]. Loneliness can occur within unstable [[marriages]] or other close [[interpersonal relationship|relationships]] of a similar nature, in which feelings present may include [[anger]] or [[resentment]], or in which the feeling of [[love]] cannot be given or received. Loneliness may represent a dysfunction of [[Interpersonal communication|communication]], and can also result from places with low [[Population density|population densities]] in which there are comparatively few people to interact with. Loneliness can also be seen as a [[social phenomenon]], capable of spreading like a disease. When one person in a group begins to feel lonely, this feeling can spread to others, increasing everybody's risk for feelings of loneliness.<ref>{{cite news |last=Parker |first=Pope |url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/why-loneliness-can-be-contagious/ |title=Why loneliness can be contagious |accessdate=10 December 2012 |work=The New York Times |date=1 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328120121/http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/01/why-loneliness-can-be-contagious/ |archive-date=28 March 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> People can feel lonely even when they are surrounded by other people.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1943748,00.html#ixzz0YZghiRRl |title=Feeling Alone Together: How Loneliness Spreads |publisher=Time.com |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=10 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101008041556/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1943748,00.html#ixzz0YZghiRRl |archive-date=8 October 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nWhether a [[Correlation and dependence|correlation]] exists between [[Internet]] usage and loneliness is a subject of controversy, with some findings showing that Internet users are lonelier<ref>{{cite book |first=Carole |last=Hughes |year=1999 |title=The relationship of use of the Internet and loneliness among college students |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=Boston College |oclc=313894784}}{{page needed|date=July 2013}}</ref> and others showing that lonely people who use the Internet to keep in touch with loved ones (especially seniors) report less loneliness, but that those trying to make friends online became lonelier.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/cpb.2007.0010 |title=Internet Use and Loneliness in Older Adults |year=2008 |last1=Sum |first1=Shima |last2=Mathews |first2=R.

This delineation was made in 1973 by Robert S. Weiss, in his seminal work: ''Loneliness: The Experience of Emotional and Social Isolation'' <ref name  = \"Weiss1973 \">Weiss, R.S. Loneliness: The Experience of Emotional and Social Isolation; The MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, USA, 1973.</ref> Based on Weiss's view that \"both types of loneliness have to be examined independently, because the satisfaction for the need of emotional loneliness cannot act as a counterbalance for social loneliness, and vice versa\", people working to treat or better understand loneliness have tended two treat these two types of loneliness separately, though this is far from always the case.<ref>''Loneliness at Universities: Determinants of Emotional and Social Loneliness among Students'' , Int.

Weiss tied his concept of emotional loneliness to [[attachment theory]]. People have a need for deep attachments, which can sometimes be fulfilled by close friends, but much more often by close family members such as parents, and later in life by romantic partners.

Psychologists have asserted that the formation of a committed romantic relationship is a critical development task for young adults.

People in romantic relationships tend to report less loneliness than single people, providing their relationship provides them with emotional intimacy.

In particular, one way of thinking about loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of [[Interpersonal relationship|social interaction]],<ref name=\"Peplau, L.A. 1982 pp. 1-18\">{{cite book|last1=Peplau|first1=L.A.|title=Loneliness: A sourcebook of current theory, research and therapy|last2=Perlman|first2=D.|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=1982|isbn=978-0-471-08028-2|editor1-last=Peplau|editor1-first=Letitia Anne|location=New York|pages=1\u201318|chapter=Perspectives on loneliness|editor2-last=Perlman|editor2-first=Daniel}}</ref> while [[solitude]] is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or in the middle of a crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own optimal level of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or [[over-stimulation]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Suedfeld |first1=P. |year=1989 |chapter=Past the reflection and through the looking-glass: Extending loneliness research |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Hojat |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Crandall |title=Loneliness: Theory, research and applications |pages=51\u20136 |location=Newbury Park, California |publisher=Sage Publications}}</ref>\n\nSolitude can have positive effects on individuals.

Chronic loneliness is more permanent and not easily relieved.<ref>Duck, S. (1992). Human relations (2nd ed.).  London: Sage Publications.</ref> For example, when a person is sick and cannot socialize with friends, this would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person with long term feelings of loneliness regardless of if they are at a family gathering or with friends is experiencing chronic loneliness. \n\n===Loneliness as a human condition===\nThe [[existentialist]] school of thought views loneliness as the essence of being [[human]]. Each human being comes into the world alone, travels through life as a separate person, and ultimately dies alone.

Reasons for this include various loneliness measurement scales being used by different studies, differences in how even the same scale is implemented from study to study, and as cultural variations across time and space may impact how people report the largely subjective phenomena of loneliness.<ref name = \"overview2018\">\n{{cite web\n|url= https://whatworkswellbeing.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/woocommerce_uploads/2018/10/Full-report-Tackling-loneliness-Oct-2018.pdf\n|title= An overview of reviews: the effectiveness of interventions to address loneliness at all stages of the life-course\n|publisher= whatworkswellbeing.org\n|date = October 2018\n|authors = Professor Christina Victor, Professor Louise Mansfield, Professor Tess Kay, Professor Norma Daykin, Mr Jack Lane, Ms Lily Grigsby Duffy, Professor Alan Tomlinson, Professor Catherine Meads\n|accessdate=1 March 2020}}\n</ref><ref name =\"FSU2013\"/>\n\nOne consistent finding has been that loneliness is not evenly distributed across a nation's population. It tends to be concentrated among vulnerable sub groups; for example the poor, the unemployed, and immigrants.

Early 20th century work sometimes treated loneliness as a wholly negative phenomena. Yet transient loneliness is now generally considered beneficial. The capacity to feel it may have been evolutionarily selcted for, a healthy [[aversive]] emotion that motivates individuals to strengthen social connections. <ref>Sometimes called the  \"reaffiliation motive\", e.g. see  [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25910393 Loneliness across the life span]   </ref> Transient loneliness is sometimes compared to short term [[Hunger (motivational state)|hunger]], which is unpleasant but ultimately useful as it motivates us to eat.<ref name =\"Masi2010\"/> <ref name =\"Ami2015\"/>  <ref name = \"Rubenstein1982\">{{cite book\n | author = Carin Rubenstein, Phillip R.

Whereas transient loneliness typically motivates us to improve relationships with others, chronic loneliness can have the opposite effect. This is as long term social isolation can cause [[hypervigilance]]. While enhanced vigilance may have been evolutionary adaptive for individuals who went long periods without others watching their backs,  it can lead to excessive cynicism and suspicion of other people, which in turn can be detrimental to interpersonal relationships . So without intervention, chronic loneliness can be self-reinforcing. <ref name =\"Masi2010\"/> <ref name =\"Ami2015\"/> <ref name =\"Rubenstein1982\"/>\n\n====Benefits====\nMuch has been written about the benefits of being alone, yet often, even when authors use the word \"loneliness\", they are referring to what could be more precisely described as voluntary solitude. Yet some assert that even long term involuntary loneliness can have beneficial effects. <ref name = \"virtues\">\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/03/the-virtues-of-isolation/521100/\n|title= The Virtues of Isolation\n|publisher= [[The Atlantic]]\n|date = March 2017\n|authors = Brent Crane\n|accessdate=5 April 2020}}\n</ref>  <ref name = \"Alberti2019\"/>\n\nChronic loneliness is often seen as a purely negative phenomena from the lens of social and medical science. Yet in spiritual and artistic traditions, it has been viewed as having mixed effects. Though even within these traditions, there can be warnings not to intentionally seek out chronic loneliness or other afflictions - just advise that if one falls into them, there can be benefits.  In western arts, there is a long belief that psychological hardship, including loneliness, can be a source of creativity.<ref name = \"Alberti2019\"/> In spiritual traditions, perhaps the most obvious benefit of loneliness is that in can increase the desire for a union with the divine. More esoterically, the psychic wound opened up by loneliness or other afflictions has been said, e.g. by [[Simone Weil]], to open up space for God to manifest within the soul.  In Christianity, [[spiritual dryness]] has been seen as advantageous as part of the [[Dark Night of the Soul|\"dark night of the soul\"]], an ordeal that while painful,  can result in spiritual transformation. From a secular perspective, while the vast majority of empirical studies focus on the negative effects of long term loneliness, a few studies have found there can also be benefits, such as enhanced perceptiveness of social situations. <ref name = \"Alberti2019\"/> <ref name = \"Only\">\n{{cite web\n|url= https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/03/the-virtues-of-isolation/521100/\n|title= Only the lonely\n|publisher= [[Aeon (digital magazine)|aeon]]\n|date = July 2016\n|authors = Cody Delistraty\n|accessdate=5 April 2020}}\n</ref>\n\n====Physical health====\nChronic loneliness can be a serious, life-threatening health condition.

Retirement, poor health, loss of a significant other or other family or friends, all contribute to loneliness. The isolation leads to loneliness; the loneliness leads to self harm or suicidal thoughts or actions.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Suicides caused by loneliness in seniors can sometime be difficult to identify. Often they don't have anyone to disclose their feelings of loneliness and the despair it brings. They will stop eating, alter the doses of medications they should take, choose not to treat an illness leading as a way to help expedite death so they don't have to deal with feeling lonely.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\nCultural influences can also cause loneliness leading to suicidal thoughts or actions. For example, Hispanic and Japanese cultures value interdependence. When a person from one of these cultures feels removed or feels they can't sustain relationships in their families or society they start to have negative behaviours which include negative thoughts or acting [[self-destructive]]ly. Other cultures, such as Caucasian have a culture that is more independent, culturally.While the cause of loneliness in a person may stem from different circumstances or cultural norms the impact lead to the same results, a desire to end life.\n\n==Physiological mechanisms link to poor health==\nThere are a number of potential physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes. In 2005, results from the American ''[[Framingham Heart Study]]'' demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of [[Interleukin 6|Interleukin 6 (IL-6)]], a blood chemical linked to [[heart disease]]. A 2006 study conducted by the ''Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience'' at the [[University of Chicago]] found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood pressure reading for adults over the age of fifty. Another finding, from a survey conducted by [[John Cacioppo]] from the [[University of Chicago]], is that doctors report providing better [[Health care|medical care]] to patients who have a strong network of family and friends than they do to patients who are alone. Cacioppo states that loneliness impairs [[cognition]] and [[will (philosophy)|willpower]], alters [[DNA]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in [[White blood cell|immune cells]], and leads over time to [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]].<ref name=\"Science of Loneliness.com\">Cacioppo, John; [[William Patrick, author|Patrick, William]], ''Loneliness: Human Nature and the Need for Social Connection'', New York : W.W.

For some commentators, such as professor Ben Lazare Mijuskovic, ever since the dawn of civilization, it has been the single strongest motivator for human activity after essential physical needs are satisfied.  Loneliness is the first negative condition identified in the Holy Bible, with the [[Book of Genesis]] showing God creating a companion for man to relief loneliness. Nevertheless, there is relatively little direct record of explicit loneliness relief efforts prior to the 20th century. Some commentators including professor Rubin Gotesky have argued the sense of aloneness was rarely felt until older communal ways of living began to be disrupted by the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]. <ref name = \"Mijuskovic2012\"/><ref name = \"I&I\"/><ref name = \"Alberti2019\"/>\n\nStarting in the 1900s, and especially in the 21st century, efforts explicitly aiming to alleviate loneliness became much more common. Loneliness reduction efforts occur across multiple disciplines, often by actors for whom loneliness relief is not their primary concern.  For example, civic planning, the design of new housing developments, and university administration. Across the world, many departments and even entire NGO's dedicated to  loneliness relief have been established. For example in the UK, the ''Campaign to End Loneliness.'' <ref name =\"Masi2010\"/><ref name = \"EcoPH2018\"/> <ref name = \"Alberti2019\"/>\n\n===Medical treatment===\nTherapy is a common way of treating loneliness; for individuals whose loneliness is caused by factors that respond well to medical intervention, it is often successful. Short-term therapy, the most common form for lonely or depressed patients, typically occurs over a period of ten to twenty weeks. During therapy, emphasis is put on understanding the cause of the problem, reversing the negative thoughts, feelings, and attitudes resulting from the problem, and exploring ways to help the patient feel connected. Some doctors also recommend [[group therapy]] as a means to connect with other sufferers and establish a support system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.depression.com/psychotherapy.html |title=Psychotherapy |accessdate=29 March 2008 |work=Depression.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217142720/http://www.depression.com/psychotherapy.html |archive-date=17 December 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> Doctors also frequently prescribe [[anti-depressants]] to patients as a stand-alone treatment, or in conjunction with therapy.

These treatments include [[exercise]], [[dieting]], [[hypnosis]], [[electro-shock therapy]], [[acupuncture]], and [[herbal remedies|herbs]], amongst others. Many patients find that participating in these activities fully or partially alleviates symptoms related to depression.<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | title=Alternative treatments for depression | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.webmd.com/depression/alternative-therapies-depression?page=2 | work =WebMD | pages = | accessdate = 30 March 2008 | language = }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Paro robot.jpg|thumb|[[Paro (robot)|Paro]], a robot pet seal classified as a medical device by U.S. regulators]]\nAnother treatment for both loneliness and depression is [[pet]] therapy, or [[animal-assisted therapy]], as it is more formally known. Studies and surveys, as well as [[anecdotal evidence]] provided by volunteer and community organizations, indicate that the presence of animal companions such as [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[rabbit]]s, and [[guinea pig]]s can ease feelings of depression and loneliness among some sufferers. Beyond the companionship the animal itself provides there may also be increased opportunities for socializing with other pet owners. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] there are a number of other health benefits associated with pet ownership, including lowered [[blood pressure]] and decreased levels of [[cholesterol]] and [[triglycerides]].<ref name=\"Pets\">[https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/health_benefits.htm Health Benefits of Pets] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315034007/https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/health_benefits.htm |date=15 March 2017 }} (from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]).

Earlier dictionary definitions of loneliness equated it with solitude \u2013 a state that was often seen as positive, unless taken to excess. From about 1800, the word loneliness began to acquire its modern definition as a painful subjective condition. This may due to economic and social changes arising out the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Such as alienation and increased interpersonal competition, along with a reduction in the number of people that would enjoy close and enduring connections with the people living in close proximity with them, as may for example have been the case for modernising pastoral villages.<ref>{{cite book\n | author = [[Pankaj Mishra]]\n | title = [[Age of Anger]]\n | year = 2017\n | pages = 75, 172, 187\u2013188, 269\u2013270, 336\u2013338\n | publisher = [[Penguin Books]]\n |ISBN = 9780141984087\n }}</ref>\n<ref name = \"Alberti2019\">{{cite book\n | author = [[Fay Bound Alberti]]\n | title = A Biography of Loneliness: The History of an Emotion\n | year = 2019\n | pages = 1\u201340, 61\u201383\n | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n |ISBN = 9780198811343\n }}</ref>\nDespite growing awareness of the problem of loneliness, widespread social recognition of the problem was limited, and scientific study remained sparse, until the last quarter of the twentieth century.

He never fully established himself in the United first-team however, and was [[loan (football)|loaned]] out to [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] and [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. During a further loan spell at [[Royal Antwerp FC|Royal Antwerp]], he was banned from football for life for attacking a Belgian [[referee (association football)|referee]], although the ban was later substantially reduced.\n\nIn 2002, Wallwork moved to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], where he was the Player of the Year for [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]]. He was not always a regular in the side however, and spent time on loan at [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] and [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]]. His spell at Barnsley was cut short when he was [[stabbed]] in a nightclub, causing him to miss more than two months of the [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]] season.

It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun 'Gay' Dhawan]], [[Shraddha 'Nepotism Product' Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Porkistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.

It is produced by [[Bhushan Kumar]], [[Krishan Kumar (actor)|Krishan Kumar]] and Lizelle D'Souza under the banners [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]] and Remo D'Souza Entertainment. The film stars [[Varun Dhawan]], [[Shraddha Kapoor]], [[Prabhu Deva]] and [[Nora Fatehi]]. Its music is composed by [[Sachin\u2013Jigar]], [[Tanishk Bagchi]], [[Badshah (rapper)|Badshah]], [[Guru Randhawa]], Gurinder Seagal and Harsh Upadhyay, and released under the banner T-Series. The story explores a dance competition between some [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Pakistani]] dancers.\n\nOriginally planned as a sequel to Disney's ''[[ABCD 2]]'' (2015), the film was taken off the title due to Disney's exit from Indian film production, and was instead renamed to its current title after Bhushan Kumar took over as producer. Filming commenced in February 2019 in [[Punjab]], later moved to [[London]] and was wrapped up in July 2019. It was theatrically released in India on 24 January 2020.\n\n==Plot==\nInder Singh Narula ([[Punit Pathak]]) is a dancer who is part of a dance team named Street Dancer. Inder is dancing at the Ground Zero Battle with his brother Sahej Singh Narula ([[Varun Dhawan]]) cheering for him and while doing a flip stunt, he lands on his leg and injures it. After two years, he is healing, but cannot dance. Sahej forms Street Dancer again and converts it into a studio through money whose sources he is hesitant about revealing. Poddy ([[Raghav Juyal]]), is one of Sahej's close friends, along with D ([[Dharmesh Yelande]]) and Sushi (Sushant Pujari), who are all part of Street Dancer. While showing the dance studio to the Street Dancer team, they run into Inayat ([[Shraddha Kapoor]]) and her team, the Rule Breakers, dance as well. Sahej and Inayat have always been at standstills against each other and they have a dance battle. The Rule Breakers beat Street Dancer, embarrassing Sahej in the process. Inayat's cousin, Zain ([[Salman Yusuff Khan]]), takes her home. Their family is very orthodox and Inayat lies about her dancing, hiding the truth from them. \n\nSahej visits the Royals, an all time, record-holding dance group that always wins the Ground Zero Competition. His girlfriend, Mia ([[Nora Fatehi]]) is on the team, and she is an incredible dancer. They discuss on how irritated Sahej is by Inayat, and she calms him down. Mia trains the Street Dancer gang, giving them the spark they wanted. The two gangs meet up in a restaurant for a cricket match between India (Sahej's team) and Pakistan (Inayat's team). India wins and this leads to a dance battle where Mia shows her moves. The police and the restaurant manager, Ram Prasad a.k.a. Anna ([[Prabhu Deva]]) control the fight. As they leave, Inayat sees some homeless people entering the restaurant from the back door. She follows them and meets Ram. He explains to her that these are illegal immigrants, and he feeds them food that isn't used. He takes her to an area where many illegal immigrants reside. He tells her that they can't go back to their home as they have no money. She gets emotional and begins to help them.\n\nOne day when Poddy reaches the dance studio, he sees Sahej being interrogated by the cop. Sahej reveals that when he went to India for his cousin's marriage, he met Amrinder Mehrotra ([[Aparshakti Khurana]]) and his three other friends playing drum in the marriage. He was impressed by their talent. They request Sahej to take them to London which he denies. After they offer a huge amount of 40 lakhs he agrees to take them to London. That's how he got the money to buy the dance studio. Poddy promises to not tell it to anyone.\n\nThe Ground Zero Battle returns. Inder asks Sahej to participate and win it. Inayat decides to participate so that they can use the money to help the illegal immigrants and Ram supports her. The two gangs meet and Ram says that if they become one they can easily win the competition. But both of them deny the offer. Sahej impresses the Royals with his dance at a nightclub. He, D, Poddy and Sushi are selected for the Royals. The two gangs meet in the restaurant again. They have an argument, which ends up with Ram dancing, showcasing his ability to Sahej. Sahej, blinded by his ego, turns down the opportunity. Poddy is in a relationship with Alisha, a girl from Inayat's gang. He realises that Inayat's gang are participating in the Ground Zero Battle so that they can retrieve them the prize money  which is a hundred thousand pounds to help illegal immigrants and tells Sahej about it at the Royals dance studio. Sahej does not believe Poddy and a fight ensues between the both of them. This causes Poddy to leave the Royals and he decides to join the Rule Breakers. Inayat accepts Poddy into the team and other members of the Street Dancer team also feel left out as Sahej spends his time with the Royals. \n\nThe first round of the competition is easily surpassed by both the Royals and the Rule Breakers. As Sahej, D and Shushi gets into a bus, they run into Amrinder. Amrinder tells Sahej that after he dropped them off, they went to a hostel. Over there, all illegal immigrants were staying and they were chased by the police. Leaving his identity as a Sikh and his passport, he and the three Punjabi drummers joined the homeless people. Inayat's gang were dancing to help them. He asks Sahej for help but he leaves saying he does not know him.\n\nBoth teams surpass the quarter finals and enter into semi finals. Later, the Royals and Sahej are walking in London. They run into the drummers where the leader of the Royals accidentally breaks his drums. After seeing them, Sahej feels guilty of his deeds. In the semi final round, Sahej leaves the Royals and helps Inayat's gang win the round. He then quits the Royals, breaking Mia\u2019s heart, and forms Street Dancer again.\n\nMany practices occur, and then Inayat's family finds out about her dancing actions. They ban her from dancing, shocking the team. Sahej and Zain go to her house, and convince her family to let her dance. A relationship blossoms between Sahej and Inayat as they prepare for the final round of the Ground Zero Battle. The Royals perform and amazes the crowd. Street Dancer performs and in the middle of their dance, a member of the Royals take off the music. The host tells them that if there is no music, they cannot dance. Amrinder then uses his drums with his friends to make music for them to dance to. The leader of the Royals finds out that his team member took off the music and he asks to puts it back in, since he did not want to cheat. At the end of their dance, Sahej does the flip stunt, which got his brother injured, flawlessly. Making his brother and his country proud, Sahej gets Street Dancer to defeat the Royals and wins the competition, also earning the Royals\u2019 respect. In the end, Sahej and Inayat begin a friendship as they help the immigrants.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Varun Dhawan]] as Sahej Singh Narula, an aspiring dancer who follows his brother's footsteps.
