Business boomed as Suzuki built [[loom|weaving looms]] for Japan's giant silk industry.<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 April 1996 |title=Cars are a sideline for Suzuki; sport-utes carry the load |periodical=Automotive News |issue=5656 |pages=S72(2) }}</ref> In 1929, Michio Suzuki invented a new type of weaving machine, which was exported overseas. The company's first 30 years focused on the development and production of these machines.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nDespite the success of his looms, Suzuki believed that his company would benefit from diversification and he began to look at other products. Based on consumer demand, he decided that building a small car would be the most practical new venture. The project began in 1937, and within two years Suzuki had completed several compact [[prototype]] cars. These first Suzuki motor vehicles were powered by a then-innovative, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-cylinder engine. It had a cast aluminum [[crankcase]] and [[gearbox]] and generated {{convert|13|hp}} from a displacement of less than 800cc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nWith the onset of World War II, production plans for Suzuki's new vehicles were halted when the government declared civilian passenger cars a \"non-essential commodity.\" At the conclusion of the war, Suzuki went back to producing looms. Loom production was given a boost when the U.S. government approved the shipping of cotton to Japan. Suzuki's fortunes brightened as orders began to increase from domestic textile manufacturers. But the joy was short-lived as the cotton market collapsed in 1951.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nFaced with this colossal challenge, Suzuki returned to the production of motor vehicles. After the war, the Japanese had a great need for affordable, reliable personal transportation. A number of firms began offering \"clip-on\" gas-powered engines that could be attached to the typical bicycle. Suzuki's first two-wheeled vehicle was a bicycle fitted with a motor called, the \"Power Free.\" Designed to be inexpensive and simple to build and maintain, the [[1952 Power Free]] had a 36&nbsp;cc, one horsepower, [[two-stroke]] engine.<ref name=\"tt\">{{cite web|title=Twist the Throttle: Suzuki|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/video-topics/cars-bikes/car-guide-videos/suzuki-part-one.htm|work=Discovery Channel|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC.|access-date=23 August 2013|format=Video|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102205317/http://dsc.discovery.com/video-topics/cars-bikes/car-guide-videos/suzuki-part-one.htm|archive-date=2 January 2013}}</ref> The new double-sprocket gear system enabled the rider to either pedal with the engine assisting, pedal without engine assist, or simply disconnect the pedals and run on engine power alone.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The patent office of the new democratic government granted Suzuki a financial [[subsidy]] to continue research in motorcycle engineering.\n\n[[File:Suzuki Suzulight 01.jpg|thumb|1955 Suzulight]]\nBy 1954, Suzuki was producing 6,000 motorcycles per month and his company had officially changed its name to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd.

Such rationalization, including a reduction in the number of parts tightened by nuts and bolts, enabled the Choinori to be sold at the low price of 59,800 yen.

Over the years, the product range has widened and ownership has changed hands as the customer has evolved.\n\nMaruti Suzuki offers models ranging from the [[Maruti 800]] to the premium [[sedan (car)|sedan]] [[Suzuki Kizashi#Kizashi in India|Maruti Suzuki Kizashi]] and luxury SUV Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara. Maruti 800 was the first model launched by the company in 1983 followed by mini-van [[Maruti Omni]] in 1984. [[Maruti Gypsy]], launched in 1985, came into widespread use with the [[Indian Army]] and [[Indian Police Service]] becoming its primary customers. The short-lived [[Maruti 1000]] was replaced by [[Maruti Esteem]] in 1994.\n\n[[Maruti Zen]], launched in 1993, was the company's second compact car model. The company went on to launch another compact car [[Maruti Wagon-R]] followed by [[Maruti Baleno]] in 1999. It was later replaced by the Suzuki SX4. The SX4 further was replaced by [[Maruti Suzuki Ciaz|Ciaz]].\n\nIn 2000, [[Maruti Alto]] was launched. The Maruti models include Maruti [[Suzuki Grand Vitara]], launched in 2003, [[Maruti Versa]], launched in 2004, [[Maruti Swift|Maruti Suzuki Swift]], launched in 2005, [[Maruti Zen Estilo]] and Maruti [[Suzuki SX4]], launched in 2007.\n\nOn 14 February 2011, Maruti announced that it had achieved one million total accumulated production volume of the Alto. The Alto has reached the million units mark in just seven years and five months since its launch in September 2000. The last half of the million was achieved in 25 months. The Alto became the third car by Maruti Suzuki stable to cross the million units mark, following the Maruti 800 and the Omni.\n\nIn January 2012 at the New Delhi [[Auto Expo]], Maruti presented a new car called the [[Maruti XA Alpha|Maruti Suzuki XA Alpha]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://overdrive.in/details/1385/Maruti-Suzuki-XA-Alpha-origins |title=Maruti Suzuki XA Alpha origins \u2013 Overdrive |publisher=Overdrive.in |date=15 March 2011 |access-date=17 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225032354/http://overdrive.in/details/1385/Maruti-Suzuki-XA-Alpha-origins |archive-date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marutisuzuki.com/concept-xa-alpha-unveiled.aspx |title= Concept XA Alpha unveiled |publisher= Marutisuzuki.com |date= 5 January 2012 |access-date= 17 April 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130524183527/http://www.marutisuzuki.com/concept-xa-alpha-unveiled.aspx |archive-date= 24 May 2013 |url-status= dead}}</ref> to commence production in mid-late 2013.\nMaruti Suzuki unveiled the Vitara Brezza in the Indian Auto Expo 2016 as a contender in the compact SUV segment.\n\n[[Maruti Exports]] Limited is Maruti's exporting subsidiary and, as such, does not operate in the domestic Indian market except in its capacity as an exporter for [[Maruti Suzuki]] and for the international [[Suzuki Motor Corporation]] as well as their other affiliates.

This model was initially sold as a 3-door [[hatchback]] and would be [[Chevrolet]]'s smallest model.\n[[File:2004.suzuki.grand.vitara.2point0td.arp.jpg|thumb|2004 Suzuki XL-7]]\n\nThe [[Suzuki Jimny|Samurai]] was also introduced in 1985 for the 1986 model year and was the first car introduced to the United States by the newly created American Suzuki Corp. No other Japanese company sold more cars in the United States in its first year than Suzuki. The Samurai was available as a [[Convertible (car)|convertible]] or [[hardtop]] and the company slogan was ''Never a Dull Moment''. The Samurai was successful until [[Consumer Reports]] alleged the Samurai of being susceptible to roll over in a 1988 test. This led to a much publicized [[Suzuki Samurai v Consumers Union|1996 lawsuit]], not settled until 2004.\n\nIn 1989, American Suzuki introduced the [[Suzuki Swift|Swift]] which was the 2nd generation Suzuki Cultus. The Swift was available as a GTi and GLX hatchback with a 4-door sedan following in 1990. A new small SUV called the [[Suzuki Escudo|Sidekick]] was also introduced in 1989. 1991 saw the introduction of the 4-door Suzuki Sidekick, the first 4-door mini-SUV in North America. The Swift and Sidekick were cousins to GM's [[Geo Metro]] and [[Geo Tracker]] and were mostly produced in [[Ingersoll, Ontario|Ingersoll]], Ontario, Canada by Suzuki and GM's joint venture, CAMI. The Swift GT/GTi and 4-door models were imported from Japan. Negative evaluations from [[Consumer Reports]] of the Suzuki Samurai led to some temporary setbacks at American Suzuki as annual sales in the following years dropped to below 20,000 units.\n\nIn 1995, American Suzuki introduced the [[Suzuki Esteem|Esteem]] and redesigned the Swift. The Swift GT was dropped and this version Swift was specific only to North America where it was built at CAMI. These models were the first Suzuki vehicles to be marketed in North America with dual front [[airbag]]s. A [[station wagon]] version of the Esteem was introduced in 1996. Worldwide Suzuki production reached more than 975,000 cars this{{which|date=February 2013}} year.\n\nAlso in 1996, American Suzuki released the 2-door SUV [[Suzuki X-90|X-90]] and a revised [[Suzuki Sidekick|Sidekick Sport]] model with [[airbag|dual airbags]], a {{convert|95|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 1.6&nbsp;liter engine, 15&nbsp;inch wheels. The Sidekick was replaced by the [[Suzuki Escudo|Vitara]] and the [[Suzuki Grand Vitara|Grand Vitara]] for 1999. The Grand Vitara would be Suzuki's first model with a V6-cylinder engine and available 4-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] brakes.\n\nThe [[Suzuki XL7|XL-7]] was introduced in 1998 as a stretched version of the Grand Vitara. The XL-7 had a larger 2.7&nbsp;liter V6-cylinder engine and 3-row seating. This would be Suzuki's largest vehicle to date.\n\nThe Swift was dropped from the model lineup in 2001 and the [[Suzuki Esteem|Esteem]] was replaced in 2002 by the new [[Suzuki Aerio|Aerio]], which was offered as a 4-door sedan and 5-door [[Crossover SUV|crossover]] with [[Four-wheel drive|4-wheel drive]] as an option.\n\nIn 2004, General Motors and Suzuki jointly purchased the bankrupt [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo Motors]] renaming the venture GMDAT. American Suzuki rebadged the compact [[Daewoo Nubira]]/[[Daewoo Lacetti]] as the [[Suzuki Forenza|Forenza]] and the mid-size [[Daewoo Magnus]] as the [[Suzuki Verona|Verona]]. The [[Suzuki Forenza|Forenza]] gained [[station wagon]] and hatchback body style in 2005, with the hatchback sold under the [[Suzuki Reno|Reno]] name.\n\n2006 was the first year American Suzuki sold more than 100,000 vehicles in the United States. Suzuki redesigned the Grand Vitara in 2006 as well as introduced the all-new [[Suzuki SX4]] and [[Suzuki XL7]] in 2007. The [[Suzuki SX4]] is produced as a joint venture with [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat]] and the XL7 (notice the shortening of the name from Grand Vitara XL-7) was produced as a joint venture with GM at CAMI Automotive Inc. in Ingersoll. Suzuki put XL7 production on indefinite hiatus in mid-2009 due to low demand and subsequently sold off its share of CAMI back to GM later that year.\n\nDespite a difficult domestic US automarket, Suzuki kept pace with its 2007 sales numbers in 2008.

After all, it is famous for making motorcycles as well as clever small cars. The PIXY is Suzuki's answer to Toyota's i-Real. The difference is that Suzuki has built a small van-like 'car' (called the SSC, for Suzuki Sharing Coach) that the PIXY docks into. So, you can drive on main roads in your SSC and then scoot along the footpath in your PIXY. It's a dream for now, but Suzuki already produces a small motorised buggy for the elderly, so maybe this isn't so far away after all.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simister|first=John|title=Tokyo Motor Show: I have seen the future \u2013 and it's fun|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/features/tokyo-motor-show-i-have-seen-the-future--and-its-fun-398262.html|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=30 October 2007|quote=Take those wheeled pods.

Its name suggests that Toyota is serious about this device. Do you think it could work? No, nor do I. Suzuki does, though, and takes the notion a stage further with its Pixy + SSC. The Pixy part is, again, a three-wheeled, single-seater pod, this time weatherproof with a windscreen and roof, two of which can dock inside the Suzuki Sharing Coach (SSC) for higher speeds and longer drives. Electricity comes from a hydrogen fuel cell and solar energy, and the SSC recharges the Pixies as it drives along.}}</ref>\n*'''X-HEAD''' is a concept vehicle that debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Auto Show.

Business boomed as Suzuki built [[loom|weaving looms]] for Japan's giant silk industry.<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 April 1996 |title=Cars are a sideline for Suzuki; sport-utes carry the load |periodical=Automotive News |issue=5656 |pages=S72(2) }}</ref> In 1929, Michio Suzuki invented a new type of weaving machine, which was exported overseas. The company's first 30 years focused on the development and production of these machines.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nDespite the success of his looms, Suzuki believed that his company would benefit from diversification and he began to look at other products. Based on consumer demand, he decided that building a small car would be the most practical new venture. The project began in 1937, and within two years Suzuki had completed several compact [[prototype]] cars. These first Suzuki motor vehicles were powered by a then-innovative, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-cylinder engine. It had a cast aluminum [[crankcase]] and [[gearbox]] and generated {{convert|13|hp}} from a displacement of less than 800cc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nWith the onset of World War II, production plans for Suzuki's new vehicles were halted when the government declared civilian passenger cars a \"non-essential commodity.\" At the conclusion of the war, Suzuki went back to producing looms. Loom production was given a boost when the U.S. government approved the shipping of cotton to Japan. Suzuki's fortunes brightened as orders began to increase from domestic textile manufacturers. But the joy was short-lived as the cotton market collapsed in 1951.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nFaced with this colossal challenge, Suzuki returned to the production of motor vehicles. After the war, the Japanese had a great need for affordable, reliable personal transportation. A number of firms began offering \"clip-on\" gas-powered engines that could be attached to the typical bicycle. Suzuki's first two-wheeled vehicle was a bicycle fitted with a motor called, the \"Power Free.\" Designed to be inexpensive and simple to build and maintain, the [[1952 Power Free]] had a 36&nbsp;cc, one horsepower, [[two-stroke]] engine.<ref name=\"tt\">{{cite web|title=Twist the Throttle: Suzuki|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/video-topics/cars-bikes/car-guide-videos/suzuki-part-one.htm|work=Discovery Channel|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC.|access-date=23 August 2013|format=Video|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102205317/http://dsc.discovery.com/video-topics/cars-bikes/car-guide-videos/suzuki-part-one.htm|archive-date=2 January 2013}}</ref> The new double-sprocket gear system enabled the rider to either pedal with the engine assisting, pedal without engine assist, or simply disconnect the pedals and run on engine power alone.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The patent office of the new democratic government granted Suzuki a financial [[subsidy]] to continue research in motorcycle engineering.\n\n[[File:Suzuki Suzulight 01.jpg|thumb|1955 Suzulight]]\nBy 1954, Suzuki was producing 6,000 motorcycles per month and his company had officially changed its name to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd.

The appropriate engine output, body structure, and required functions were reviewed from the basic design phase in pursuit of mass reduction, rationalization of parts, and high quality. It achieved mass reduction of about 40% compared with a conventional scooter by reducing the size of parts, the application of a new engine, a newly designed frame, and by careful reduction of the number of plastic parts. Such rationalization, including a reduction in the number of parts tightened by nuts and bolts, enabled the Choinori to be sold at the low price of 59,800 yen. Colored resin was used for plastic parts to provide 6 body colors without the need for painting. A new high-speed cylinder plating technology was introduced for the newly developed 4-stroke engine to enable high-speed processing at low cost. This reduced the weight of the engine by about 40% compared with a conventional 50 cc engine.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013091253/http://www.jsae.or.jp/autotech/data_e/4-29e.html|archive-date=13 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:CONCEPT\u30fbS2.JPG|thumb|Suzuki's Concept S2 previews design concepts for the second generation Swift at the 2003 [[Osaka Auto Messe]]]]\n** SMAC opens Suzuki's only U.S. manufacturing facility in [[Rome, Georgia]] and begins producing the [[Suzuki Eiger 400|Eiger]] series of [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Suzuki Becomes a ''Made-in-America'' Manufacturer with Opening of Georgia ATV Plant|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2002/05/31/141262.html|work=The Auto Channel|accessdate=2 October 2013|date=31 May 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Swibel|first=Matthew|title=Hail, Rome!|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0423/082.html|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=6 April 2007|quote=Suzuki hired its first 60 production workers (24 of them with the Coosa Valley certification) in 2002 and another 100 last year.

Over the years, the product range has widened and ownership has changed hands as the customer has evolved.\n\nMaruti Suzuki offers models ranging from the [[Maruti 800]] to the premium [[sedan (car)|sedan]] [[Suzuki Kizashi#Kizashi in India|Maruti Suzuki Kizashi]] and luxury SUV Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara. Maruti 800 was the first model launched by the company in 1983 followed by mini-van [[Maruti Omni]] in 1984. [[Maruti Gypsy]], launched in 1985, came into widespread use with the [[Indian Army]] and [[Indian Police Service]] becoming its primary customers. The short-lived [[Maruti 1000]] was replaced by [[Maruti Esteem]] in 1994.\n\n[[Maruti Zen]], launched in 1993, was the company's second compact car model. The company went on to launch another compact car [[Maruti Wagon-R]] followed by [[Maruti Baleno]] in 1999. It was later replaced by the Suzuki SX4. The SX4 further was replaced by [[Maruti Suzuki Ciaz|Ciaz]].\n\nIn 2000, [[Maruti Alto]] was launched. The Maruti models include Maruti [[Suzuki Grand Vitara]], launched in 2003, [[Maruti Versa]], launched in 2004, [[Maruti Swift|Maruti Suzuki Swift]], launched in 2005, [[Maruti Zen Estilo]] and Maruti [[Suzuki SX4]], launched in 2007.\n\nOn 14 February 2011, Maruti announced that it had achieved one million total accumulated production volume of the Alto. The Alto has reached the million units mark in just seven years and five months since its launch in September 2000. The last half of the million was achieved in 25 months. The Alto became the third car by Maruti Suzuki stable to cross the million units mark, following the Maruti 800 and the Omni.\n\nIn January 2012 at the New Delhi [[Auto Expo]], Maruti presented a new car called the [[Maruti XA Alpha|Maruti Suzuki XA Alpha]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://overdrive.in/details/1385/Maruti-Suzuki-XA-Alpha-origins |title=Maruti Suzuki XA Alpha origins \u2013 Overdrive |publisher=Overdrive.in |date=15 March 2011 |access-date=17 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225032354/http://overdrive.in/details/1385/Maruti-Suzuki-XA-Alpha-origins |archive-date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marutisuzuki.com/concept-xa-alpha-unveiled.aspx |title= Concept XA Alpha unveiled |publisher= Marutisuzuki.com |date= 5 January 2012 |access-date= 17 April 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130524183527/http://www.marutisuzuki.com/concept-xa-alpha-unveiled.aspx |archive-date= 24 May 2013 |url-status= dead}}</ref> to commence production in mid-late 2013.\nMaruti Suzuki unveiled the Vitara Brezza in the Indian Auto Expo 2016 as a contender in the compact SUV segment.\n\n[[Maruti Exports]] Limited is Maruti's exporting subsidiary and, as such, does not operate in the domestic Indian market except in its capacity as an exporter for [[Maruti Suzuki]] and for the international [[Suzuki Motor Corporation]] as well as their other affiliates.

This model was initially sold as a 3-door [[hatchback]] and would be [[Chevrolet]]'s smallest model.\n[[File:2004.suzuki.grand.vitara.2point0td.arp.jpg|thumb|2004 Suzuki XL-7]]\n\nThe [[Suzuki Jimny|Samurai]] was also introduced in 1985 for the 1986 model year and was the first car introduced to the United States by the newly created American Suzuki Corp. No other Japanese company sold more cars in the United States in its first year than Suzuki. The Samurai was available as a [[Convertible (car)|convertible]] or [[hardtop]] and the company slogan was ''Never a Dull Moment''. The Samurai was successful until [[Consumer Reports]] alleged the Samurai of being susceptible to roll over in a 1988 test. This led to a much publicized [[Suzuki Samurai v Consumers Union|1996 lawsuit]], not settled until 2004.\n\nIn 1989, American Suzuki introduced the [[Suzuki Swift|Swift]] which was the 2nd generation Suzuki Cultus. The Swift was available as a GTi and GLX hatchback with a 4-door sedan following in 1990. A new small SUV called the [[Suzuki Escudo|Sidekick]] was also introduced in 1989. 1991 saw the introduction of the 4-door Suzuki Sidekick, the first 4-door mini-SUV in North America. The Swift and Sidekick were cousins to GM's [[Geo Metro]] and [[Geo Tracker]] and were mostly produced in [[Ingersoll, Ontario|Ingersoll]], Ontario, Canada by Suzuki and GM's joint venture, CAMI. The Swift GT/GTi and 4-door models were imported from Japan. Negative evaluations from [[Consumer Reports]] of the Suzuki Samurai led to some temporary setbacks at American Suzuki as annual sales in the following years dropped to below 20,000 units.\n\nIn 1995, American Suzuki introduced the [[Suzuki Esteem|Esteem]] and redesigned the Swift. The Swift GT was dropped and this version Swift was specific only to North America where it was built at CAMI. These models were the first Suzuki vehicles to be marketed in North America with dual front [[airbag]]s. A [[station wagon]] version of the Esteem was introduced in 1996. Worldwide Suzuki production reached more than 975,000 cars this{{which|date=February 2013}} year.\n\nAlso in 1996, American Suzuki released the 2-door SUV [[Suzuki X-90|X-90]] and a revised [[Suzuki Sidekick|Sidekick Sport]] model with [[airbag|dual airbags]], a {{convert|95|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 1.6&nbsp;liter engine, 15&nbsp;inch wheels. The Sidekick was replaced by the [[Suzuki Escudo|Vitara]] and the [[Suzuki Grand Vitara|Grand Vitara]] for 1999. The Grand Vitara would be Suzuki's first model with a V6-cylinder engine and available 4-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] brakes.\n\nThe [[Suzuki XL7|XL-7]] was introduced in 1998 as a stretched version of the Grand Vitara. The XL-7 had a larger 2.7&nbsp;liter V6-cylinder engine and 3-row seating. This would be Suzuki's largest vehicle to date.\n\nThe Swift was dropped from the model lineup in 2001 and the [[Suzuki Esteem|Esteem]] was replaced in 2002 by the new [[Suzuki Aerio|Aerio]], which was offered as a 4-door sedan and 5-door [[Crossover SUV|crossover]] with [[Four-wheel drive|4-wheel drive]] as an option.\n\nIn 2004, General Motors and Suzuki jointly purchased the bankrupt [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo Motors]] renaming the venture GMDAT. American Suzuki rebadged the compact [[Daewoo Nubira]]/[[Daewoo Lacetti]] as the [[Suzuki Forenza|Forenza]] and the mid-size [[Daewoo Magnus]] as the [[Suzuki Verona|Verona]]. The [[Suzuki Forenza|Forenza]] gained [[station wagon]] and hatchback body style in 2005, with the hatchback sold under the [[Suzuki Reno|Reno]] name.\n\n2006 was the first year American Suzuki sold more than 100,000 vehicles in the United States. Suzuki redesigned the Grand Vitara in 2006 as well as introduced the all-new [[Suzuki SX4]] and [[Suzuki XL7]] in 2007.

After all, it is famous for making motorcycles as well as clever small cars. The PIXY is Suzuki's answer to Toyota's i-Real. The difference is that Suzuki has built a small van-like 'car' (called the SSC, for Suzuki Sharing Coach) that the PIXY docks into. So, you can drive on main roads in your SSC and then scoot along the footpath in your PIXY. It's a dream for now, but Suzuki already produces a small motorised buggy for the elderly, so maybe this isn't so far away after all.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simister|first=John|title=Tokyo Motor Show: I have seen the future \u2013 and it's fun|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/features/tokyo-motor-show-i-have-seen-the-future--and-its-fun-398262.html|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=30 October 2007|quote=Take those wheeled pods.

Its name suggests that Toyota is serious about this device. Do you think it could work? No, nor do I. Suzuki does, though, and takes the notion a stage further with its Pixy + SSC. The Pixy part is, again, a three-wheeled, single-seater pod, this time weatherproof with a windscreen and roof, two of which can dock inside the Suzuki Sharing Coach (SSC) for higher speeds and longer drives. Electricity comes from a hydrogen fuel cell and solar energy, and the SSC recharges the Pixies as it drives along.}}</ref>\n*'''X-HEAD''' is a concept vehicle that debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Auto Show.

The industrial metropolis and port city is the administrative headquarter of the [[Schweinfurt (district)|district of Schweinfurt]], important authority location, university, art city and seat of a [[Fraunhofer Institute]]. Schweinfurt is, as a German exception, almost only from the city center, which is why the population offers no benchmark. The [[urban agglomeration]] has 100,200 (2018)<ref name=\"GUA\"/> and the catchment area of the city 759,000&nbsp;inhabitants. To this area belongs the Main-Rh\u00f6n region, characterized by nature parks and spas, and the middle part of [[South Thuringia]].\n\nSchweinfurt was first documented in&nbsp;791 and is one of the oldest cities in Bavaria. Around&nbsp;1000 the Margraves of Schweinfurt Margraves controlled large parts of northern Bavaria, from the [[12th&nbsp;century]] until&nbsp;1802 Schweinfurt was [[Free imperial city]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], around&nbsp;1700 a [[humanistic]] center and in&nbsp;1770 began the 250-year industrial history. \n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the Americans suffered their biggest air defeat over Schweinfurt in the [[Second Raid on Schweinfurt]] ''(Black Thursday)''. On April&nbsp;11,&nbsp;1945, the US&nbsp;Army invaded the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mihalko-family.com/Conn%20Barracks.htm|title=Mihalko Family: U.S. Army Barracks in Schweinfurt, Germany|publisher=Ron Mihalko|accessdate=2019-12-11}}</ref> During the [[Cold&nbsp;War]], the 1945 founded [[USAG&nbsp;Schweinfurt]] had the highest concentration of US&nbsp;combat units in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]]. In the northwest of Schweinfurt, an American town emerged, with a complete civil infrastructure including all kinds of shops for 12,000&nbsp;Americans, soldiers and civilians. Until the withdrawal of the US&nbsp;Army at Schweinfurt in&nbsp;2014, a&nbsp;total of about 100,000&nbsp;US&nbsp;soldiers were stationed in the city. \n\n1990 Schweinfurt gained much in centrality through the [[german reunification]] and became a motorway junction in the German center. Schweinfurt was not deindustrialized by overcoming the structural crisis around&nbsp;1992 and has the highest employment density&nbsp;(2015) and the third highest gross domestic product per inhabitant of Germany&nbsp;(2014). The world's largest bearing group [[SKF]], the second largest [[Schaeffler]], the second largest automotive supplier in the world [[ZF&nbsp;Friedrichshafen]] and the [[DAX]]&nbsp;group [[Fresenius Medical Care]] have their largest plants in Schweinfurt.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.schweinfurt.de/en/business1/companies2/index.html|title=Who is already in Schweinfurt?|publisher=schweinfurt.de|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref>\n\nWorld-important inventions come from the city on the Main: the pedal bike by Philipp Moritz Fischer&nbsp;(1853) and [[freewheel]]&nbsp;(1889) and [[coaster brake]]&nbsp;(1903) by Ernst Sachs.

It is only certain that at no point in time were swine driven across a ford in the Main River. This surely would have reassured [[Friedrich R\u00fcckert]].

Weka Info-Verlag, Mering 2002, pp. 5. </ref> He occupied an important position in the central Reich territory, the [[Duchy of Franconia]]. Berthold gave the king of [[East Francia]] [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;I.]] (936-973), who in&nbsp;962 became [[Roman-German Emperor]], valuable weapons aid against rebellious tribal dukes. As thanks Berthold of Otto I received the counties for the Folkfeld- and the Radenzgau and the Margraviate for the Nordgau, about the present-day Upper Palatinate. Thus he was and from&nbsp;980 his son Henry the most powerful secular nobility in the area of today's northern Bavaria.\n\n[[Image:Jitka a c\u00edsa\u0159.jpg|thumb|left|Judith von Schweinfurt (center) (Depiction from the 14th century)]]\n\nLater supported Count [[Henry of Schweinfurt]] (called: ''Hezilo'') the East Frankish [[Henry II of Germany|Henry&nbsp;II]] (1002-1024, from&nbsp;1014 Roman-German Emperor) in the royal election of&nbsp;1002 and was awarded the Duke dignity of Bavarians. After the election, however, Henry&nbsp;II did not fulfill the promise. \nThereupon it came to the ''Schweinfurt&nbsp;Feud'' in 1003.<ref name = \"ISS5\"/> Count Heinrich lost all his possessions. The confiscated royal goods formed the core of the new bishopric of [[Bamberg]]. Hezilo, however, retained his possessions around the castle hill ''Peterstirn''. The family, in which [[Judith of&nbsp;Schweinfurt]] became a central figure in the history of the old Schweinfurt city, died in the male line of&nbsp;1057 and at the latest this year marks the undisputed end of the important role of the Margraves of Schweinfurt.\n\nTo the beginnings of today's old town from the [[12th&nbsp;century]], 1&nbsp;km&nbsp;west of the previous settlement between the both streams ''Marienbach'' and ''H\u00f6llenbach'', there are different views. The from a gradual construction to a planned Civitas Imperii ([[imperial city]]), so a founding city, by Emperor [[Frederick&nbsp;I Barbarossa]], using existing royal estate, rich. In the struggle for supremacy in ''Main Franconia'' (region arround the [[River Main]]) between the Henneberger and the Bishop of [[W\u00fcrzburg]], the city was destroyed between 1240 and 1250 ''(First City Spoilage)''. However, it is controversial whether this destruction was still in the old settlement between H\u00f6llenbach and Marienbach and thus a reason for the rebuilding of the city on the farther west, today's site was or whether the destruction took place here already. In a letter from King [[William II of Holland|William of Holland]] dated January&nbsp;9,&nbsp;1254, it is said that Schweinfurt used to be imperial city ''(... Swinforde, que olim imperii civitas fuerat)''. It remains unclear whether rights have ever been withdrawn from the city or whether only reference is made to the city's destruction. However, this letter is the first documentary evidence of Schweinfurt as imperial city and thus as a place with [[city rights]].<ref name=\"STH\">Schweinfurt | City | Culture | topics.

The danger of being estranged from the Empire in the long run could only be banned by large financial sacrifices by self-triggering&nbsp;(1361/1385). As a result, numerous royal privileges strengthened the municipality in legal and economic terms.\n\nIn the [[15th&nbsp;century]] began the construction of a territory around the core city, which lasted until&nbsp;1620. In&nbsp;1436, the fishermen's settlement of ''Fischerrain'', which borders on the city wall and lies just to the southwest, whose origins lie in the darkness of history, was incorporated into the city. Due to positive economic development, the city can acquire the suburb of Oberndorf in&nbsp;1436. 1436/37 received the advice of the city from the [[Teutonic Knight]]s for 18,000 guilders the castle on the ''Peterstirn'' and the associated land area with the villages Zell and Weipoltshausen, which belongs to [[\u00dcchtelhausen]] today.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== 16th to 18th centuries ===\n[[Image:Schweinfurt 1792.png|thumb|left|Imperial city Schweinfurt Territory 1620-1802,\nand surrounding areas]]\n\nSchweinfurt joined the [[Reformation]] relatively late, in&nbsp;1542 since the city, together with neighboring imperial villages and imperial villages, was completely surrounded by the Catholic Hochstift W\u00fcrzburg.<ref name=\"CSW\">City map Schweinfurt with history and sights.

This went as the ''Second City Spoilage'' in the city history (''First City Spoilage'' see: [[#8th to 13th centuries|8th to 13th centuries]]). The reconstruction dragged on until 1615. In this form, the old town, with the exception of later modernized fortifications, remained almost unchanged until the early [[19th&nbsp;century]]. In&nbsp;1609 the city joined the [[Protestant Union]]. The imperial city territory was supplemented 1620 also still around Madenhausen,<ref name=\"CSW\"/> which also belongs to \u00dcchtelhausen today. Due to the acquisitions, the territory of the imperial city now had an extension of 17&nbsp;km from southwest to northeast. As a result of the city of Schweinfurt on the knight canton of Baunach a nearly continuous Protestant corridor was created by the Hochstifte [[W\u00fcrzburg]] and [[Bamberg]] in the Protestant Duchy of [[Saxony]].<ref>Several authors: Great Atlas of World History.

In the first century of industrialization, the chemical and paint industry started in Schweinfurt, with the construction of the Wolf's lead white mill at the Bleiwei\u00dfm\u00fchlenwehr. She should, according to Dr. Ferdinand Gademann (1880-1969) was the oldest German lead white factory. In&nbsp;1780 she was taken over by Johann Martin Schmidt. Further factory-similar plants of this kind originated at the Bellevue and in the neighboring suburb [[Niederwerrn]]. \n\nBy the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss Schweinfurt 1802 came to Bavaria, three years before the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] was founded. 4000 people demonstrated against the Anschluss at the Rossmarkt. After the interim membership of the Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg (1810-1814) Schweinfurt fell in 1814 to the Kingdom of Bavaria. The villages belonging to the imperial city territory were spun off. As a result, Schweinfurt lost about two thirds of its territory.\n\n1852 took place with the opening of the ''Ludwigs-Westbahn'' from [[Bamberg]] to the new [[Schweinfurt Stadt station]] the connection to the railway network. With the construction of the line to [[Bad Kissingen]] (1871) and the [[Schweinfurt\u2013Meiningen railway]] (1874) Schweinfurt became a railway junction. In&nbsp;1874, a large marshalling and central station was built 3&nbsp;km&nbsp;west of the city station, at that time on Oberndorf district, the so-called ''Central Station'' and today's [[Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof]] at the [[Bamberg\u2013Rottendorf railway]]. It was created in a far-sighted manner amidst fields as a passenger and goods main station, with the aim of leaving as much room for the expected industrialization of the station, which also took place here until the end of the&nbsp;1930s was. The Schweinfurt tram was the first municipal tram in Bavaria from 1895 to&nbsp;1921 to connect the Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof with the city center.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Schweinfurt in the ''Gr\u00fcnderzeit'' in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]\" heights=\"120\">\n Stra\u00dfenbahn Schweinfurt.png|Schweinfurt tram near the<br/>[[Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof]] (central station)\n (1913) SCHWEINFURT Fichtel & Sachs Abb.2.jpg|[[Fichtel & Sachs|Fichtel & Sachs AG]] 1913\n 1 Ultsch2 Spitalstra\u00dfe mit Pferdebahn nach 1896 S. 44.jpg|Spitalstra\u00dfe after 1894 with tram \n Schweinfurt, Luitpoldstra\u00dfe 21-crop.jpg|District of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit \n 1 Ultsch1 Leinritt am Fischerrain Pumpwerk Maxbr\u00fccke um 1902 S. 34.jpg|Main mills\n</gallery>\n\nUnlike many other cities, the 1930s in Schweinfurt were one of the most important epochs of urban development.

Thus Schweinfurt recovered relatively quickly from its third period of destruction. The tank barracks renamed Ledward Barracks in&nbsp;1946, became the headquarters of the newly founded U.S.&nbsp;Army Garrison Schweinfurt (USAG Schweinfurt). The U.S. Army took over the [[Luftwaffe]] Airfield as [[Schweinfurt Army Heliport]] and renamed the air base to ''Conn Barracks''. In the course of time, until 2014, they were expanded into large barracks with many hangars, administration buildings, a large event hall, church and sports facilities.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the late 1990s, a civilian infrastructure similar to that of a small American town was successively built in the northwest of Schweinfurt. As a result of the closure of many other German U.S.&nbsp;sites, Schweinfurt eventually became one of Europe's largest U.S.&nbsp;locations. Including the ''Br\u00f6nnhof'' training area the USAG&nbsp;Schweinfurt covered a total area of 29&nbsp;km\u00b2. Schweinfurt formerly hosted the U.S. Army Garrison Schweinfurt, which the U.S. Army closed on 19 September 2014 due to an ongoing effort to concentrate the U.S. military's footprint in Germany to fewer communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/us-army-says-farewell-to-schweinfurt-1.304017|title=US Army says farewell to Schweinfurt|author=|date=|website=stripes.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Reconstruction and postwar period ===\n[[Image:Wiki chk Fichtel-Sachs AG 01.jpg|thumb|Ernst-Sachs-Stra\u00dfe in 1959]]\n\nA quick, scheduled rebuilding of the city was not necessary due to the degree of destruction of 40&nbsp;to&nbsp;45% (see: [[#Cityscape|Cityscape]]). Like many other West German cities, Schweinfurt also experienced an unprecedented economic miracle in the 1950s and 1960s, and large-scale industry boomed. To counteract the labor shortage, guest workers were recruited from 1960 onwards.\n\nMost of the postwar construction projects were realized under the aegis of Mayor Georg Wichtermann (SPD, 1965-1974), in the city governed by the [[SPD]] by an absolute majority. Numerous new residential districts were created. By the ''Jump over the River Main'' (starting from&nbsp;1963)<ref name = \"ISS5\"/> developed south of the Main River the commercial park ''Port East'' and the new industrial area ''Port West''. The infrastructure was expanded, with the Main Port (1963) and today's [[University of Applied Sciences W\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt]] (1971).\n\nAfter successful reconstruction and the boom years, the time of Mayor Kurt Petzold (SPD, 1974\u20131992) was marked by consolidation, but also by the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] and recessions, with job cuts in the local large-scale industry. The old town renovation began in&nbsp;1979,<ref name = \"ISS5\"/> as the starting point of a 40-year-long transformation of the city that has continued to this day, with a change in image, from the gray mouse industrial city to a city with a high quality of life. The large city  ''Leopoldina Hospital'' was opened in 1981.<ref name = \"ISS5\"/>\n\n=== The era Grieser 1992-2010 ===\n[[Image:Schweinfurt, R\u00fcfferstra\u00dfe 4-002.jpg|thumb|left|Kunsthalle (art gallery, 1933/2009)]]\n\nIn the city dominated by the SPD, the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] succeeded in 1992 for the first time to make the Lord Mayor, with the political cross-starter [[Gudrun Grieser]]. The Bavarian state government under the then Prime Minister [[Edmund Stoiber]] (CSU) sympathetically accompanied the historical change of power and parts of the Bavarian State Social Court and the Bavarian State Statistics Office were relocated from [[Munich]] to Schweinfurt. During Grieser's term of office, the economic situation stabilized starting in the mid-1990s, with 4,500 new industrial jobs and around 6,000&nbsp;jobs in the service sector. Trade tax revenue rose to a record high.\n\n[[Image:EinkaufsgalerieSW3.jpg|thumb|Stadtgalerie Schweinfurt,<br/>a 300 m long shopping mall (2009)]]\n\nIn the Grieser era, the city's new motto, ''Industry and Art'', was developed. A large number of projects, in cooperation with the construction officer Jochen M\u00fcller (SPD) gave the city a new face, set new, nationally recognized symbols in architecture and were honored with numerous architecture prizes. Among the many realized projects are the new Industrial Park ''Gewerbepark Maintal'' (since&nbsp;1995),<ref name = \"ISS5\"/> the [[Museum Georg Sch\u00e4fer]] (2000),<ref name = \"ISS5\"/> the ''Maininsel Conference Center'' (2004), the ''Stadtb\u00fccherei Ebracher Hof'' (2007), the [[Kunsthalle Schweinfurt]] (art gallery, 2009), the [[Stadtgalerie Schweinfurt]], a 300&nbsp;m long shopping mall 2009) with redesign of the Weststadt (westend) and the new [[Schweinfurt Mitte station]], the Youth Hostel (2009), the ''Health Park Schweinfurt'' (2009) and the Campus&nbsp;2 of the [[University of Applied Sciences W\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt]]. The era of Grieser remains to this day shaping the city, like no other epoch after the reconstruction and it changed the city's image lasting positive.\n\nIn 1998 German and American veterans and survivors of the bombing raids came together to erect a [[war memorial]] to the fallen. 2004 startet the [[Unterfrankenshuttle]] ''(Lower Franconia Shuttle)'' of the [[Erfurter Bahn]] (EB) [[regional railway]] with lines from Schweinfurt to other parts of [[Lower Franconia]] and to [[South Thuringia]]. \n\n=== Present ===\n[[Image:Stadtmauer an der Neutorstra\u00dfe in Schweinfurt.JPG|thumb|''New Hadergasse Project'' (2014)<br/>on the city wall at the former Neutor]]\n\nThe ''New Hadergasse Project'' was implemented under the current mayor Sebastian Remel\u00e9 (CSU, since&nbsp;2010). Trade tax receipts continued to rise and the city was able to save reserves. These are currently being used for the mammoth U.S.&nbsp;conversion project, which is currently one of the five largest military conversion projects in Germany.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The [[i-Campus Schweinfurt]] in the former Ledward Barracks and the new district of Bellevue in the former Askren Manor Housing Area deserve special mention.\n\n== Geography ==\n=== Location ===\nSchweinfurt has a very central location in ''Bavaria's German Center'' and is located about 40&nbsp;km from [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], [[Hesse]] and [[Thuringia]], in the middle of Main Franconia, the German-speaking region and the [[European Union]]. Schweinfurt is also located on the main shipping route Main, which connects the [[North Sea]] with the [[Black Sea]] via the [[Rhine-Main-Danube Canal]]. The city is located between [[Frankfurt]] (110&nbsp;km west) and [[Nuremberg]] (90&nbsp;km southeast), both with international airports. But Schweinfurt is not in any metropolitan area and is easily locatable on the map of Germany, at the beginning of the Main triangle, downstream of the Main quadrilateral follows. 20&nbsp;km north is the former world bath [[Bad&nbsp;Kissingen]].\n\nSchweinfurt also has a natural location in the Franconian wine country, at the ''Schweinfurter Rh\u00f6n'', with the National Natural Heritage ''Br\u00f6nnhof'' and is surrounded by [[Ha\u00dfberge Hills]], [[Steigerwald]], [[Rh\u00f6n]] and [[Spessart]], with several natural parks and a biosphere reserve.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.schweinfurt.de/en/life1/franconian1/index.html|title=The doors are always open and the table is set for a great meal!|publisher=schweinfurt.de|accessdate=2019-12-08}}</ref> In sight are Steigerwald, ''Gramschatzer Forest'' and Rh\u00f6n. The city is located in a climatically contrasting region, between the summer hot ''Mainfr\u00e4nkischen Plates'' in the south and the low mountain range in the north, with international winter sports in [[Oberhof, Germany|Oberhof]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"120\">\n Main catchment.png|Schweinfurt is in the middle<br/>the catchment area<br/>of the River Main ...\n Karte Schweinfurter Becken 2.png|... and on the northeastern edge of the ''Schweinfurt Basin''\n 151011-154548 Bene-Pano.jpg|View from the ''Zabelstein'' Mountain in the Steigerwald<br/>over the ''Schweinfurt Basin'' direction city \n Ehemalige Spinnm\u00fchle in Schweinfurt.jpg|River Main with old mills (right), old town<br/>and the old fishing district ''Fischerrain'' (left)\n Schlo\u00df Bismarcksh\u00f6he Herbst 19.10.2008 006.jpg|The ''Schweinfurt Main Bend''<br/>with village and castle Mainberg<br/>and vineyards,<br/>at right the city park\n</gallery>\n\nSchweinfurt itself is also a city of great contrasts, in terms of topography, use and population structure. The bourgeois east lies on the foothills of the ''Schweinfurter Rh\u00f6n'', is intersected by valleys with streams, with the above the ''Marienbach'' located old town and numerous detached houses, on the edge with vineyards and city forest. The west, with city, main station and (former) working-class neighborhoods, has a high proportion of migrants. And in the almost uninhabited south, here in the boardwalk, protected by dykes ''Schweinfurt Basin'', with Main Harbor, is the largest contiguous industrial area in Bavaria, in which half a dozen works of large-scale industry lined up gate to gate, like nowhere else in Germany.\n\n=== New centrality ===\nAs a result of the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], the economic and geographical situation of Schweinfurt changed fundamentally. In&nbsp;2005, the [[Thuringian Forest]] Autobahn&nbsp;71 [[Erfurt]]-Schweinfurt was completed as a transport ''Project German Unity'' No.&nbsp;16. In&nbsp;2017 Schweinfurt gained further centrality with the 10&nbsp;billion&nbsp;Euro transport ''Project German Unity'' No.&nbsp;8. [[Berlin]] is now under three and a half hours, [[Munich]] from 2:33&nbsp;hours and [[Hamburg]] from 3:57&nbsp;hours reachable, now two high-speed lines, with change in [[Bamberg]] and [[W\u00fcrzburg]]. Berlin and Munich are about three quarters of an hour faster from Schweinfurt than from Frankfurt. Paris is in 6:22&nbsp;hours recheable. As part of the ''Deutsche Bahn Long-Distance Transport Offensive'' Schweinfurt receives no later than December 2028 a direct ''Inter City'' (IC) connection, through the new IC Bamberg-[[Stuttgart]]-[[T\u00fcbingen]].\n\n{{NeighbouringCommunities|noicon=true|width=auto\n| NORTHWEST = [[Dortmund]] ''350&nbsp;km''<br />{{RSIGN|DE|A|44}}\n| NORTH = [[Kassel]] ''200&nbsp;km''<br />{{RSIGN|DE|A|7}}<br />'''E 10\u00b0'''\n| NORTHEAST = [[Erfurt]] ''160&nbsp;km''<br />{{RSIGN|DE|A|71}}\n| WEST = [[Frankfurt]] ''160&nbsp;km''<br />{{RSIGN|DE|A|3}} '''Main N 50 \u00b0'''<br />[[W\u00fcrzburg]] ''45&nbsp;km''\n| EAST = [[Bayreuth]] ''120&nbsp;km''<br />'''N 50 \u00b0 Main''' {{RSIGN|DE|A|70}}<br />[[Bamberg]] ''55&nbsp;km''\n| SOUTHWEST = {{RSIGN|DE|A|81}}<br />[[Stuttgart]] ''190&nbsp;km''\n| SOUTH = '''E 10\u00b0'''<br />{{RSIGN|DE|A|7}}<br />[[Ulm]] ''230&nbsp;km''\n| SOUTHEAST = {{RSIGN|DE|A|73}}<br />[[N\u00fcrnberg]] ''120&nbsp;km''\n}}\n\n=== Viticulture ===\n[[Image:Schweinfurt Stahlstich 1847.jpg|left|thumb|Schweinfurt's east side with vineyards. Steel engraving from 1847]]\n\nViticulture has probably been practiced in the city for well over 1000&nbsp;years. At the beginning of the [[19th&nbsp;century]], Schweinfurt was an important Franconian wine-growing and wine-trading town. At the end of the imperial city period in&nbsp;1802 there were around 320&nbsp;hectares of vines, which corresponds to today's largest Franconian wine-growing town in [[Nordheim am Main]]. Large parts of today's district, right up to the edge of the old town, are located on former vineyards. [[Goethe]] appreciated the Schweinfurt wine and had large quantities delivered. Today, with only 3.54&nbsp;hectares of vineyards (2017),<ref>Government of Lower Franconia: Vineyard sites in Bavaria broken down by area</ref> the local viticulture has hardly any economic, but still cultural importance for the self-awareness and way of life of the city.\n\n[[Image:Weinberg Peterstirn - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|Vineyard ''Schweinfurter Peterstirn'']]\n\nThe [[phylloxera]] appeared in Franconia in&nbsp;1902 and hit the Schweinfurt area particularly hard.<ref> Bavarian State Institute for Viticulture and Horticulture: History of Franconian Viticulture </ref> Since the 1980s, viticulture with the leading variety [[Silvaner]] has been carried out as planned in the historic wine locations of ''Peterstirn'' and ''Mainleite''. Due to the almost complete interruption of winegrowing, the vineyards were spared the major land consolidation of the 1970s, during which the historical structures were mostly destroyed. The small wine-cultural landscape at Peterstirn Palace remained intact. There is a family-owned winery on Peterstirn, where a wine festival takes place twice a year.\n\n=== Districts ===\nIn the Bavarian territorial reform no suburbs were incorporated into the city of Schweinfurt, which is why the urban area includes only the core city and incorporated in&nbsp;1919 Oberndorf. The urban area was divided into 23&nbsp;statistical districts, which are summarized in 15&nbsp;districts (bold font in the table). For a long time, the Bergl was the most populous district, with 13,000&nbsp;inhabitants around 1970. With only 9,163&nbsp;inhabitants at the end of&nbsp;2017, it was only second, after the city center, with 11,276&nbsp;inhabitants.<ref>Register of registered population (with secondary residences) and population structure according to the city of Schweinfurt 2018</ref>\n\n[[Image:Karte Stadtteile Stadt Schweinfurt.png|right|thumb|400px|Districts of the city of Schweinfurt]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable zebra\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Urban structure and social structure\n\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n!

Although several suburbs had already grown together with the city, in the course of the Bavarian territorial reform not a place was incorporated. Schweinfurt therefore covers almost only the core city in comparison to almost all other German cities and became the smallest district-free city in Germany. For example, Schweinfurt has only half the area of the nearby spa town of [[Bad&nbsp;Kissingen]]. \n\nIn 1939 Schweinfurt had 50,000 inhabitants and 1970 the highest level with 58,500&nbsp;inhabitants. While thereafter, in particular in the course of the area reforms, almost all other German cities could compensate for [[demographic]]-related decrease of inhabitants by incorporations, in Schweinfurt the population decreased until 1987 to&nbsp;52,000. Thereafter, she rose to 1996 as a result of late repatriates back to 56,000. In&nbsp;2014, the number of inhabitants fell to&nbsp;51,600, the lowest since the early 1950s. Thereafter, contrary to the forecasts of the Bavarian State Statistics Office and the [[Bertelsmann Foundation]], both of which merely continued the demographic development, a positive turnaround occurred due to several factors not taken into account: refugees, US&nbsp;conversion, i-Campus&nbsp;Schweinfurt and the new trend in the cities, also in Schweinfurt in connection with high quality of life of city and region. Since&nbsp;2015, the number of inhabitants has been rising steadily, most recently to&nbsp;54,032 at the end of&nbsp;2018. Schweinfurt's core city has thus experienced a relatively small decrease in its population compared to most of the other core German cities since its peak levels around 1970.\n\nNot included in the population statistics are members of the [[U.S. Army Garrison Schweinfurt]] stationed in and near the city between 1945 and 2014 with their families. These were at times over 12,000 people.\n\nThe [[urban agglomeration]] is in the case of Schweinfurt a better comparison size to the population of other cities. In 1994, it had 105,000 inhabitants, fell to 96,600 inhabitants (Census 9.&nbsp;5.&nbsp;2011) and then rose again to 100,200&nbsp;inhabitants (estimate 31.&nbsp;12.&nbsp;2018).<ref name=\"GUA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/germany-agglo_d.php|title=Germany: urban agglomerations|publisher=citypopulation.de|accessdate=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Independence Day in Germany with Dr. Jill Biden.jpg|thumb|260px|The last 12,000 American soldiers and civilians living in and around Schweinfurt (here at the 2009 American Independence Day) are not included in the official population statistics]]\n\n{| class=\"toptextcells\" \n| style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:right; white-space:nowrap;\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Weka Info-Verlag, Mering 2002, pp. 5. </ref> He occupied an important position in the central Reich territory, the [[Duchy of Franconia]]. Berthold gave the king of [[East Francia]] [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&nbsp;I.]] (936-973), who in&nbsp;962 became [[Roman-German Emperor]], valuable weapons aid against rebellious tribal dukes. As thanks Berthold of Otto I received the counties for the Folkfeld- and the Radenzgau and the Margraviate for the Nordgau, about the present-day Upper Palatinate. Thus he was and from&nbsp;980 his son Henry the most powerful secular nobility in the area of today's northern Bavaria.\n\n[[Image:Jitka a c\u00edsa\u0159.jpg|thumb|left|Judith von Schweinfurt (center) (Depiction from the 14th century)]]\n\nLater supported Count [[Henry of Schweinfurt]] (called: ''Hezilo'') the East Frankish [[Henry II of Germany|Henry&nbsp;II]] (1002-1024, from&nbsp;1014 Roman-German Emperor) in the royal election of&nbsp;1002 and was awarded the Duke dignity of Bavarians. After the election, however, Henry&nbsp;II did not fulfill the promise. \nThereupon it came to the ''Schweinfurt&nbsp;Feud'' in 1003.<ref name = \"ISS5\"/> Count Heinrich lost all his possessions. The confiscated royal goods formed the core of the new bishopric of [[Bamberg]]. Hezilo, however, retained his possessions around the castle hill ''Peterstirn''. The family, in which [[Judith of&nbsp;Schweinfurt]] became a central figure in the history of the old Schweinfurt city, died in the male line of&nbsp;1057 and at the latest this year marks the undisputed end of the important role of the Margraves of Schweinfurt.\n\nTo the beginnings of today's old town from the [[12th&nbsp;century]], 1&nbsp;km&nbsp;west of the previous settlement between the both streams ''Marienbach'' and ''H\u00f6llenbach'', there are different views. The from a gradual construction to a planned Civitas Imperii ([[imperial city]]), so a founding city, by Emperor [[Frederick&nbsp;I Barbarossa]], using existing royal estate, rich. In the struggle for supremacy in ''Main Franconia'' (region arround the [[River Main]]) between the Henneberger and the Bishop of [[W\u00fcrzburg]], the city was destroyed between 1240 and 1250 ''(First City Spoilage)''. However, it is controversial whether this destruction was still in the old settlement between H\u00f6llenbach and Marienbach and thus a reason for the rebuilding of the city on the farther west, today's site was or whether the destruction took place here already. In a letter from King [[William II of Holland|William of Holland]] dated January&nbsp;9,&nbsp;1254, it is said that Schweinfurt used to be imperial city ''(... Swinforde, que olim imperii civitas fuerat)''. It remains unclear whether rights have ever been withdrawn from the city or whether only reference is made to the city's destruction. However, this letter is the first documentary evidence of Schweinfurt as imperial city and thus as a place with [[city rights]].<ref name=\"STH\">Schweinfurt | City | Culture | topics.

The danger of being estranged from the Empire in the long run could only be banned by large financial sacrifices by self-triggering&nbsp;(1361/1385). As a result, numerous royal privileges strengthened the municipality in legal and economic terms.\n\nIn the [[15th&nbsp;century]] began the construction of a territory around the core city, which lasted until&nbsp;1620. In&nbsp;1436, the fishermen's settlement of ''Fischerrain'', which borders on the city wall and lies just to the southwest, whose origins lie in the darkness of history, was incorporated into the city. Due to positive economic development, the city can acquire the suburb of Oberndorf in&nbsp;1436. 1436/37 received the advice of the city from the [[Teutonic Knight]]s for 18,000 guilders the castle on the ''Peterstirn'' and the associated land area with the villages Zell and Weipoltshausen, which belongs to [[\u00dcchtelhausen]] today.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== 16th to 18th centuries ===\n[[Image:Schweinfurt 1792.png|thumb|left|Imperial city Schweinfurt Territory 1620-1802,\nand surrounding areas]]\n\nSchweinfurt joined the [[Reformation]] relatively late, in&nbsp;1542 since the city, together with neighboring imperial villages and imperial villages, was completely surrounded by the Catholic Hochstift W\u00fcrzburg.<ref name=\"CSW\">City map Schweinfurt with history and sights.

This went as the ''Second City Spoilage'' in the city history (''First City Spoilage'' see: [[#8th to 13th centuries|8th to 13th centuries]]). The reconstruction dragged on until 1615. In this form, the old town, with the exception of later modernized fortifications, remained almost unchanged until the early [[19th&nbsp;century]]. In&nbsp;1609 the city joined the [[Protestant Union]]. The imperial city territory was supplemented 1620 also still around Madenhausen,<ref name=\"CSW\"/> which also belongs to \u00dcchtelhausen today. Due to the acquisitions, the territory of the imperial city now had an extension of 17&nbsp;km from southwest to northeast.

In the first century of industrialization, the chemical and paint industry started in Schweinfurt, with the construction of the Wolf's lead white mill at the Bleiwei\u00dfm\u00fchlenwehr. She should, according to Dr. Ferdinand Gademann (1880-1969) was the oldest German lead white factory. In&nbsp;1780 she was taken over by Johann Martin Schmidt. Further factory-similar plants of this kind originated at the Bellevue and in the neighboring suburb [[Niederwerrn]]. \n\nBy the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss Schweinfurt 1802 came to Bavaria, three years before the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] was founded. 4000 people demonstrated against the Anschluss at the Rossmarkt. After the interim membership of the Grand Duchy of W\u00fcrzburg (1810-1814) Schweinfurt fell in 1814 to the Kingdom of Bavaria. The villages belonging to the imperial city territory were spun off. As a result, Schweinfurt lost about two thirds of its territory.\n\n1852 took place with the opening of the ''Ludwigs-Westbahn'' from [[Bamberg]] to the new [[Schweinfurt Stadt station]] the connection to the railway network. With the construction of the line to [[Bad Kissingen]] (1871) and the [[Schweinfurt\u2013Meiningen railway]] (1874) Schweinfurt became a railway junction. In&nbsp;1874, a large marshalling and central station was built 3&nbsp;km&nbsp;west of the city station, at that time on Oberndorf district, the so-called ''Central Station'' and today's [[Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof]] at the [[Bamberg\u2013Rottendorf railway]]. It was created in a far-sighted manner amidst fields as a passenger and goods main station, with the aim of leaving as much room for the expected industrialization of the station, which also took place here until the end of the&nbsp;1930s was. The Schweinfurt tram was the first municipal tram in Bavaria from 1895 to&nbsp;1921 to connect the Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof with the city center.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Schweinfurt in the ''Gr\u00fcnderzeit'' in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]\" heights=\"120\">\n Stra\u00dfenbahn Schweinfurt.png|Schweinfurt tram near the<br/>[[Schweinfurt Hauptbahnhof]] (central station)\n (1913) SCHWEINFURT Fichtel & Sachs Abb.2.jpg|[[Fichtel & Sachs|Fichtel & Sachs AG]] 1913\n 1 Ultsch2 Spitalstra\u00dfe mit Pferdebahn nach 1896 S. 44.jpg|Spitalstra\u00dfe after 1894 with tram \n Schweinfurt, Luitpoldstra\u00dfe 21-crop.jpg|District of the Gr\u00fcnderzeit \n 1 Ultsch1 Leinritt am Fischerrain Pumpwerk Maxbr\u00fccke um 1902 S. 34.jpg|Main mills\n</gallery>\n\nUnlike many other cities, the 1930s in Schweinfurt were one of the most important epochs of urban development.

Thus Schweinfurt recovered relatively quickly from its third period of destruction. The tank barracks renamed Ledward Barracks in&nbsp;1946, became the headquarters of the newly founded U.S.&nbsp;Army Garrison Schweinfurt (USAG Schweinfurt). The U.S. Army took over the [[Luftwaffe]] Airfield as [[Schweinfurt Army Heliport]] and renamed the air base to ''Conn Barracks''. In the course of time, until 2014, they were expanded into large barracks with many hangars, administration buildings, a large event hall, church and sports facilities.\n\nFrom the 1950s to the late 1990s, a civilian infrastructure similar to that of a small American town was successively built in the northwest of Schweinfurt. As a result of the closure of many other German U.S.&nbsp;sites, Schweinfurt eventually became one of Europe's largest U.S.&nbsp;locations. Including the ''Br\u00f6nnhof'' training area the USAG&nbsp;Schweinfurt covered a total area of 29&nbsp;km\u00b2. Schweinfurt formerly hosted the U.S. Army Garrison Schweinfurt, which the U.S. Army closed on 19 September 2014 due to an ongoing effort to concentrate the U.S. military's footprint in Germany to fewer communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/us-army-says-farewell-to-schweinfurt-1.304017|title=US Army says farewell to Schweinfurt|author=|date=|website=stripes.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Reconstruction and postwar period ===\n[[Image:Wiki chk Fichtel-Sachs AG 01.jpg|thumb|Ernst-Sachs-Stra\u00dfe in 1959]]\n\nA quick, scheduled rebuilding of the city was not necessary due to the degree of destruction of 40&nbsp;to&nbsp;45% (see: [[#Cityscape|Cityscape]]). Like many other West German cities, Schweinfurt also experienced an unprecedented economic miracle in the 1950s and 1960s, and large-scale industry boomed. To counteract the labor shortage, guest workers were recruited from 1960 onwards.\n\nMost of the postwar construction projects were realized under the aegis of Mayor Georg Wichtermann (SPD, 1965-1974), in the city governed by the [[SPD]] by an absolute majority. Numerous new residential districts were created. By the ''Jump over the River Main'' (starting from&nbsp;1963)<ref name = \"ISS5\"/> developed south of the Main River the commercial park ''Port East'' and the new industrial area ''Port West''. The infrastructure was expanded, with the Main Port (1963) and today's [[University of Applied Sciences W\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt]] (1971).\n\nAfter successful reconstruction and the boom years, the time of Mayor Kurt Petzold (SPD, 1974\u20131992) was marked by consolidation, but also by the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] and recessions, with job cuts in the local large-scale industry. The old town renovation began in&nbsp;1979,<ref name = \"ISS5\"/> as the starting point of a 40-year-long transformation of the city that has continued to this day, with a change in image, from the gray mouse industrial city to a city with a high quality of life. The large city  ''Leopoldina Hospital'' was opened in 1981.<ref name = \"ISS5\"/>\n\n=== The era Grieser 1992-2010 ===\n[[Image:Schweinfurt, R\u00fcfferstra\u00dfe 4-002.jpg|thumb|left|Kunsthalle (art gallery, 1933/2009)]]\n\nIn the city dominated by the SPD, the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|CSU]] succeeded in 1992 for the first time to make the Lord Mayor, with the political cross-starter [[Gudrun Grieser]]. The Bavarian state government under the then Prime Minister [[Edmund Stoiber]] (CSU) sympathetically accompanied the historical change of power and parts of the Bavarian State Social Court and the Bavarian State Statistics Office were relocated from [[Munich]] to Schweinfurt. During Grieser's term of office, the economic situation stabilized starting in the mid-1990s, with 4,500 new industrial jobs and around 6,000&nbsp;jobs in the service sector. Trade tax revenue rose to a record high.\n\n[[Image:EinkaufsgalerieSW3.jpg|thumb|Stadtgalerie Schweinfurt,<br/>a 300 m long shopping mall (2009)]]\n\nIn the Grieser era, the city's new motto, ''Industry and Art'', was developed. A large number of projects, in cooperation with the construction officer Jochen M\u00fcller (SPD) gave the city a new face, set new, nationally recognized symbols in architecture and were honored with numerous architecture prizes. Among the many realized projects are the new Industrial Park ''Gewerbepark Maintal'' (since&nbsp;1995),<ref name = \"ISS5\"/> the [[Museum Georg Sch\u00e4fer]] (2000),<ref name = \"ISS5\"/> the ''Maininsel Conference Center'' (2004), the ''Stadtb\u00fccherei Ebracher Hof'' (2007), the [[Kunsthalle Schweinfurt]] (art gallery, 2009), the [[Stadtgalerie Schweinfurt]], a 300&nbsp;m long shopping mall 2009) with redesign of the Weststadt (westend) and the new [[Schweinfurt Mitte station]], the Youth Hostel (2009), the ''Health Park Schweinfurt'' (2009) and the Campus&nbsp;2 of the [[University of Applied Sciences W\u00fcrzburg-Schweinfurt]]. The era of Grieser remains to this day shaping the city, like no other epoch after the reconstruction and it changed the city's image lasting positive.\n\nIn 1998 German and American veterans and survivors of the bombing raids came together to erect a [[war memorial]] to the fallen. 2004 startet the [[Unterfrankenshuttle]] ''(Lower Franconia Shuttle)'' of the [[Erfurter Bahn]] (EB) [[regional railway]] with lines from Schweinfurt to other parts of [[Lower Franconia]] and to [[South Thuringia]]. \n\n=== Present ===\n[[Image:Stadtmauer an der Neutorstra\u00dfe in Schweinfurt.JPG|thumb|''New Hadergasse Project'' (2014)<br/>on the city wall at the former Neutor]]\n\nThe ''New Hadergasse Project'' was implemented under the current mayor Sebastian Remel\u00e9 (CSU, since&nbsp;2010). Trade tax receipts continued to rise and the city was able to save reserves.

And in the almost uninhabited south, here in the boardwalk, protected by dykes ''Schweinfurt Basin'', with Main Harbor, is the largest contiguous industrial area in Bavaria, in which half a dozen works of large-scale industry lined up gate to gate, like nowhere else in Germany.\n\n=== New centrality ===\nAs a result of the fall of the [[Iron Curtain]], the economic and geographical situation of Schweinfurt changed fundamentally. In&nbsp;2005, the [[Thuringian Forest]] Autobahn&nbsp;71 [[Erfurt]]-Schweinfurt was completed as a transport ''Project German Unity'' No.&nbsp;16. In&nbsp;2017 Schweinfurt gained further centrality with the 10&nbsp;billion&nbsp;Euro transport ''Project German Unity'' No.&nbsp;8. [[Berlin]] is now under three and a half hours, [[Munich]] from 2:33&nbsp;hours and [[Hamburg]] from 3:57&nbsp;hours reachable, now two high-speed lines, with change in [[Bamberg]] and [[W\u00fcrzburg]]. Berlin and Munich are about three quarters of an hour faster from Schweinfurt than from Frankfurt. Paris is in 6:22&nbsp;hours recheable. As part of the ''Deutsche Bahn Long-Distance Transport Offensive'' Schweinfurt receives no later than December 2028 a direct ''Inter City'' (IC) connection, through the new IC Bamberg-[[Stuttgart]]-[[T\u00fcbingen]].\n\n{{NeighbouringCommunities|noicon=true|width=auto\n| NORTHWEST = [[Dortmund]] ''350&nbsp;km''<br />{{RSIGN|DE|A|44}}\n| NORTH = [[Kassel]] ''200&nbsp;km''<br />{{RSIGN|DE|A|7}}<br />'''E 10\u00b0'''\n| NORTHEAST = [[Erfurt]] ''160&nbsp;km''<br />{{RSIGN|DE|A|71}}\n| WEST = [[Frankfurt]] ''160&nbsp;km''<br />{{RSIGN|DE|A|3}} '''Main N 50 \u00b0'''<br />[[W\u00fcrzburg]] ''45&nbsp;km''\n| EAST = [[Bayreuth]] ''120&nbsp;km''<br />'''N 50 \u00b0 Main''' {{RSIGN|DE|A|70}}<br />[[Bamberg]] ''55&nbsp;km''\n| SOUTHWEST = {{RSIGN|DE|A|81}}<br />[[Stuttgart]] ''190&nbsp;km''\n| SOUTH = '''E 10\u00b0'''<br />{{RSIGN|DE|A|7}}<br />[[Ulm]] ''230&nbsp;km''\n| SOUTHEAST = {{RSIGN|DE|A|73}}<br />[[N\u00fcrnberg]] ''120&nbsp;km''\n}}\n\n=== Viticulture ===\n[[Image:Schweinfurt Stahlstich 1847.jpg|left|thumb|Schweinfurt's east side with vineyards. Steel engraving from 1847]]\n\nViticulture has probably been practiced in the city for well over 1000&nbsp;years. At the beginning of the [[19th&nbsp;century]], Schweinfurt was an important Franconian wine-growing and wine-trading town. At the end of the imperial city period in&nbsp;1802 there were around 320&nbsp;hectares of vines, which corresponds to today's largest Franconian wine-growing town in [[Nordheim am Main]]. Large parts of today's district, right up to the edge of the old town, are located on former vineyards. [[Goethe]] appreciated the Schweinfurt wine and had large quantities delivered. Today, with only 3.54&nbsp;hectares of vineyards (2017),<ref>Government of Lower Franconia: Vineyard sites in Bavaria broken down by area</ref> the local viticulture has hardly any economic, but still cultural importance for the self-awareness and way of life of the city.\n\n[[Image:Weinberg Peterstirn - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|Vineyard ''Schweinfurter Peterstirn'']]\n\nThe [[phylloxera]] appeared in Franconia in&nbsp;1902 and hit the Schweinfurt area particularly hard.<ref> Bavarian State Institute for Viticulture and Horticulture: History of Franconian Viticulture </ref> Since the 1980s, viticulture with the leading variety [[Silvaner]] has been carried out as planned in the historic wine locations of ''Peterstirn'' and ''Mainleite''. Due to the almost complete interruption of winegrowing, the vineyards were spared the major land consolidation of the 1970s, during which the historical structures were mostly destroyed. The small wine-cultural landscape at Peterstirn Palace remained intact. There is a family-owned winery on Peterstirn, where a wine festival takes place twice a year.\n\n=== Districts ===\nIn the Bavarian territorial reform no suburbs were incorporated into the city of Schweinfurt, which is why the urban area includes only the core city and incorporated in&nbsp;1919 Oberndorf. The urban area was divided into 23&nbsp;statistical districts, which are summarized in 15&nbsp;districts (bold font in the table). For a long time, the Bergl was the most populous district, with 13,000&nbsp;inhabitants around 1970. With only 9,163&nbsp;inhabitants at the end of&nbsp;2017, it was only second, after the city center, with 11,276&nbsp;inhabitants.<ref>Register of registered population (with secondary residences) and population structure according to the city of Schweinfurt 2018</ref>\n\n[[Image:Karte Stadtteile Stadt Schweinfurt.png|right|thumb|400px|Districts of the city of Schweinfurt]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable zebra\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Urban structure and social structure\n\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe5\"\n!

Although several suburbs had already grown together with the city, in the course of the Bavarian territorial reform not a place was incorporated. Schweinfurt therefore covers almost only the core city in comparison to almost all other German cities and became the smallest district-free city in Germany. For example, Schweinfurt has only half the area of the nearby spa town of [[Bad&nbsp;Kissingen]]. \n\nIn 1939 Schweinfurt had 50,000 inhabitants and 1970 the highest level with 58,500&nbsp;inhabitants. While thereafter, in particular in the course of the area reforms, almost all other German cities could compensate for [[demographic]]-related decrease of inhabitants by incorporations, in Schweinfurt the population decreased until 1987 to&nbsp;52,000. Thereafter, she rose to 1996 as a result of late repatriates back to 56,000. In&nbsp;2014, the number of inhabitants fell to&nbsp;51,600, the lowest since the early 1950s. Thereafter, contrary to the forecasts of the Bavarian State Statistics Office and the [[Bertelsmann Foundation]], both of which merely continued the demographic development, a positive turnaround occurred due to several factors not taken into account: refugees, US&nbsp;conversion, i-Campus&nbsp;Schweinfurt and the new trend in the cities, also in Schweinfurt in connection with high quality of life of city and region. Since&nbsp;2015, the number of inhabitants has been rising steadily, most recently to&nbsp;54,032 at the end of&nbsp;2018. Schweinfurt's core city has thus experienced a relatively small decrease in its population compared to most of the other core German cities since its peak levels around 1970.\n\nNot included in the population statistics are members of the [[U.S. Army Garrison Schweinfurt]] stationed in and near the city between 1945 and 2014 with their families. These were at times over 12,000 people.\n\nThe [[urban agglomeration]] is in the case of Schweinfurt a better comparison size to the population of other cities. In 1994, it had 105,000 inhabitants, fell to 96,600 inhabitants (Census 9.&nbsp;5.&nbsp;2011) and then rose again to 100,200&nbsp;inhabitants (estimate 31.&nbsp;12.&nbsp;2018).<ref name=\"GUA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/germany-agglo_d.php|title=Germany: urban agglomerations|publisher=citypopulation.de|accessdate=2019-12-10}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Flickr - The U.S. Army - Independence Day in Germany with Dr. Jill Biden.jpg|thumb|260px|The last 12,000 American soldiers and civilians living in and around Schweinfurt (here at the 2009 American Independence Day) are not included in the official population statistics]]\n\n{| class=\"toptextcells\" \n| style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:right; white-space:nowrap;\" | \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

When Lila is severely sunburned, Lenny [[quarantine]]s her to their hotel room as he engages in a series of rendezvous with Kelly, lying to Lila about his whereabouts. Lenny impulsively ends their ephemeral marriage to pursue an indifferent Kelly, his ideal woman and ultimate fantasy [[shiksa]]-[[goddess]]. He believes she is the girl he has been waiting for all of his life and just \"timed it wrong.\"\n\nAfter leaving Lila (after only five days of marriage), he follows Kelly to [[Minnesota]], where her justifiably resentful and  protective father ([[Eddie Albert]]) is a relentless obstacle. Mr. Corcoran has undisguised contempt of Lenny, even offering  Lenny a $25,000 bribe for him to leave following a dinner where Lenny inanely praises Midwestern produce as having \"no deceit in the cauliflower.\"  Lenny eventually marries Kelly, whose chief intent appears to be to rile and defy her father. At the wedding reception, Lenny's attempt to mingle with the attendees via mindless conversation fails, and he is ignored by the guests, his bride and new in-laws. He is a stranger at his own feast, quoting the cliches of the Republican press to some unimpressed children and lapsing into the same useless hum with which Lila formerly drove him mad.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Dawson|first=Jan|date=Summer 1973|title=The Heartbreak Kid|url=|journal=Sight & Sound|volume=XLII|pages=176|via=PROQUEST}}</ref> He got the girl, but appears to have lost a feeling of belonging.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Lenny Cantrow\n* [[Cybill Shepherd]] as Kelly Corcoran\n* [[Jeannie Berlin]] as Lila Kolodny\n* [[Audra Lindley]] as Mrs. Corcoran\n* [[Eddie Albert]] as Mr. Corcoran\n* [[Doris Roberts]] as Mrs. Cantrow\n* [[Martin Sherman]] as Mr. Johnson\n* [[William Prince (actor)|William Prince]] as Colorado Man\n* [[Augusta Dabney]] as Colorado Woman\n\n==Style==\nThe film is a [[black comedy]], examining love and hypocrisy through a lens of pointed, subtle humor.
