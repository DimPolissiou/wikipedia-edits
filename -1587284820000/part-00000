She was originally a member of the girl group Choice. In 1995, [[LaFace Records]] saw potential in P!nk and offered her a solo recording contract. Her [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]-influenced debut studio album ''[[Can't Take Me Home]]'' (2000) was certified [[RIAA certification|double-platinum]] in the United States and spawned two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-ten songs: \"[[There You Go]]\" and \"[[Most Girls (Pink song)|Most Girls]]\". She gained further recognition with the collaborative single \"[[Lady Marmalade#Moulin Rouge! version|Lady Marmalade]]\" from the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' soundtrack, which topped many charts worldwide. Refocusing her sound to [[pop rock]] with her second studio album ''[[Missundaztood]]'' (2001), the album sold more than 13 million copies worldwide and yielded the international number-one songs \"[[Get the Party Started]]\", \"[[Don't Let Me Get Me]]\", and \"[[Just Like a Pill]]\".\n\nWhile P!nk's third studio album, ''[[Try This]]'' (2003), sold fewer copies than her previous work, it earned her the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for the single \"[[Trouble (Pink song)|Trouble]]\". She returned to the top of record charts with her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'' (2006) and ''[[Funhouse (Pink album)|Funhouse]]'' (2008), which generated the top-ten entries \"[[Who Knew]]\" and \"[[U + Ur Hand]]\", as well as the number-one single \"[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]\". Pink's sixth studio album, ''[[The Truth About Love (Pink album)|The Truth About Love]]'' (2012), was her first album to debut atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and spawned her fourth number-one single, \"[[Just Give Me a Reason]]\". In 2014, Pink recorded a collaborative album, ''[[Rose Ave. (album)|Rose Ave.]]'', with Canadian musician [[Dallas Green (musician)|Dallas Green]] under a [[folk music]] duo named [[You+Me]]. Her seventh studio album, ''[[Beautiful Trauma]]'' (2017), became the third best-selling album of the year and saw the success of its lead single, \"[[What About Us (Pink song)|What About Us]]\".\n\nRecognized for her distinctive, raspy voice and acrobatic stage presence,<ref>{{cite magazine|url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/list/5812410/pink-s-20-biggest-billboard-hits-hot-100|title = P!nk's 20 Biggest Billboard Hits|magazine= Billboard|date = September 8, 2015|first = Jessica|last = Letkemann}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url = http://sfglobe.com/2015/04/22/pinks-live-performance-of-try| title = He Takes Her In His Arms, But After He Lets Her Go, I Was Breathtaken| date = April 27, 2015| work = The San Francisco Globe| accessdate = March 2, 2016}}</ref> Pink has sold over 90 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].<ref name=\"Newsroom\">{{cite news |url=http://www.klkntv.com/story/21674082/pink-to |title=Pink concert at Pinnacle Bank Arena announced|first=|last=|work=[[KLKN]] |date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}</ref> Her career accolades include three [[Grammy Awards]], two [[Brit Awards]], a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] and seven [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, including the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]].

She was originally a member of the girl group Choice. In 1995, [[LaFace Records]] saw potential in P!nk and offered her a solo recording contract. Her [[contemporary R&B|R&B]]-influenced debut studio album ''[[Can't Take Me Home]]'' (2000) was certified [[RIAA certification|double-platinum]] in the United States and spawned two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] top-ten songs: \"[[There You Go]]\" and \"[[Most Girls (Pink song)|Most Girls]]\". She gained further recognition with the collaborative single \"[[Lady Marmalade#Moulin Rouge! version|Lady Marmalade]]\" from the ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' soundtrack, which topped many charts worldwide. Refocusing her sound to [[pop rock]] with her second studio album ''[[Missundaztood]]'' (2001), the album sold more than 13 million copies worldwide and yielded the international number-one songs \"[[Get the Party Started]]\", \"[[Don't Let Me Get Me]]\", and \"[[Just Like a Pill]]\".\n\nWhile P!nk's third studio album, ''[[Try This]]'' (2003), sold fewer copies than her previous work, it earned her the [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for the single \"[[Trouble (Pink song)|Trouble]]\". She returned to the top of record charts with her fourth and fifth studio albums, ''[[I'm Not Dead]]'' (2006) and ''[[Funhouse (Pink album)|Funhouse]]'' (2008), which generated the top-ten entries \"[[Who Knew]]\" and \"[[U + Ur Hand]]\", as well as the number-one single \"[[So What (Pink song)|So What]]\". Pink's sixth studio album, ''[[The Truth About Love (Pink album)|The Truth About Love]]'' (2012), was her first album to debut atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and spawned her fourth number-one single, \"[[Just Give Me a Reason]]\". In 2014, Pink recorded a collaborative album, ''[[Rose Ave. (album)|Rose Ave.]]'', with Canadian musician [[Dallas Green (musician)|Dallas Green]] under a [[folk music]] duo named [[You+Me]]. Her seventh studio album, ''[[Beautiful Trauma]]'' (2017), became the third best-selling album of the year and saw the success of its lead single, \"[[What About Us (Pink song)|What About Us]]\".\n\nRecognized for her distinctive, raspy voice and acrobatic stage presence,<ref>{{cite magazine|url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/list/5812410/pink-s-20-biggest-billboard-hits-hot-100|title = P!nk's 20 Biggest Billboard Hits|magazine= Billboard|date = September 8, 2015|first = Jessica|last = Letkemann}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news| url = http://sfglobe.com/2015/04/22/pinks-live-performance-of-try| title = He Takes Her In His Arms, But After He Lets Her Go, I Was Breathtaken| date = April 27, 2015| work = The San Francisco Globe| accessdate = March 2, 2016}}</ref> Pink has sold over 90 million records worldwide, making her one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music artists]].<ref name=\"Newsroom\">{{cite news |url=http://www.klkntv.com/story/21674082/pink-to |title=Pink concert at Pinnacle Bank Arena announced|first=|last=|work=[[KLKN]] |date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=January 6, 2018}}</ref> Her career accolades include three [[Grammy Awards]], two [[Brit Awards]], a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] and seven [[MTV Video Music Award]]s, including the [[Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award]].
