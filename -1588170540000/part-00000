The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter is a spoof of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when Marion's niece Raven (played by guest [[Bernadette Peters]]) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|Oldest Man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the \"Stomach Turns\" sketch did.<ref>{{cite book|title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= |url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/asmyworldstilltu00fult}}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of \"As the Stomach Turns\" as Pocahontas Pirelli, \"the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,\" which was a play on her hit song of the time, \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]].\" She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.\n* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.\n\n==Sketches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter is a spoof of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when Marion's niece Raven (played by guest [[Bernadette Peters]]) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|Oldest Man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the \"Stomach Turns\" sketch did.<ref>{{cite book|title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= |url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/asmyworldstilltu00fult}}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of \"As the Stomach Turns\" as Pocahontas Pirelli, \"the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,\" which was a play on her hit song of the time, \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]].\" She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.\n* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.\n\n==Sketches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

In June 2017, a review of the existing legislation was announced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government-launches-review-copyright-act-1994|title=Government launches review of the Copyright Act 1994|website=The Beehive|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> \n\nNew Zealand is party to several [[international copyright agreements]], including the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS Agreement 1994]], the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention 1928]] and the [[Universal Copyright Convention|Universal Copyright Convention 1952]].\n\n== Scope of copyright ==\nThe Copyright Act 1994 provides owners of original work with a monopoly to control the use and dissemination of their work. The owner of the copyright in a work has the exclusive right to exploit the economic rights. A person infringes copyright in a work when he or she, other than pursuant to a copyright licence, does any of the following \u201crestricted acts\u201d, either in relation to the work as a whole or any \u201csubstantial part\u201d of it: <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/business/intellectual-property/copyright/copyright-protection-in-new-zealand/|title=Copyright protection in New Zealand {{!}} Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment|website=www.mbie.govt.nz|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>\n\n* copying the work\n* publishing, issuing or selling copies to the public\n* performing, playing or showing the work in public\n* broadcasting the work\n* making any work derived or adapted from the copyright work\nAnyone who wants to use someone else\u2019s work requires the permission of the right owner. The copyright owner can assign, transfer, and license the economic rights in the work.\n\n== Copyright works ==\nCopyright automatically applies (no registration required) to original works in the following categories:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Literary works (novels, poems, song lyrics, computer programming/programmes, compilations of data)\n* Dramatic works (scripts for films or plays)\n* Artistic works (paintings, plans, maps, photographs, sculptures, models, buildings)\n* Musical works (scores and arrangements)\n* Sound recordings (of musical, literary or dramatic works)\n* Films\n* Broadcasts (radio, TV, cable)\n* Typographical arrangement of published editions (this exists independent of copyright in the published work, if any)\n\nCopyright does not apply to certain government works, such as Acts of Parliament, Regulations, Parliamentary debates, Court judgments and reports of Select Committees, Royal Commissions, Commissions of Inquiry, etc.\n\n== Copyright term ==\n\nCopyright protection does not last forever. The duration of copyright protection depends on the type of work. The work will eventually enter the public domain. This means that once copyright has expired, everyone can freely use the work. Before such time permission of the rights holder is required to use a copyrighted work. New Zealand's copyright term is largely consistent with [[List of countries' copyright length|other countries]], and complies with the [[WIPO]] standard. The copyright term depends on the type of work in question. \nHere are some examples: <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works: 50 years from the death of the author\n* Sound recordings and films: 50 years from when it is available to the public\n* Broadcasts and cable: 50 years from broadcast\n* Typographical arrangements: 25 years from first publishing\n* Computer-generated work: 50 years after being made \n* Crown copyright: 100 years\n* Artistic works industrially applied: 16 years from when the work is applied\n* Artistic craftsmanship industrially applied: 25 years from when the work is applied\n\n== Exclusions and fair dealing ==\nThe Copyright Act allows for certain permitted acts to be exempted from copyright restrictions. These include: \n* [[fair dealing]] for the purpose of criticism, review, news reporting, research or private study\n* certain educational purposes\n* [[time shifting]] of TV programmes for viewing at a later time\n* [[format shifting]] of music\n* back up of computer programs\n* braille copies of literary or dramatic works\n\n== Moral rights ==\nBesides protecting the economic rights of the author, copyright law also protects the moral rights of an author. Moral rights protect the author from distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work where that act would be or is prejudicial to the reputation of the author. Moral rights are inalienably attached to the author and cannot be transferred. Some moral rights can, however, be waived. Moral rights give the author for instance the right to:\n* be identified as the author (right of attribution)\n* object to derogatory treatment of the work (right of integrity)\n* not have work falsely attributed to them\n\n== New technologies amendments ==\nIn 2001,<ref name=\"review2001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____991.aspx|title=Digital Technology and the Copyright Act 1994: A Discussion Paper|publisher=MED|date=July 2001}}</ref> the Ministry of Economic Development initiated a major review of copyright law, in light of new technologies, such as media in digital form and communications via the internet.

In June 2017, a review of the existing legislation was announced.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/government-launches-review-copyright-act-1994|title=Government launches review of the Copyright Act 1994|website=The Beehive|language=en|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref> \n\nNew Zealand is party to several [[international copyright agreements]], including the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS Agreement 1994]], the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention 1928]] and the [[Universal Copyright Convention|Universal Copyright Convention 1952]].\n\n== Scope of copyright ==\nThe Copyright Act 1994 provides owners of original work with a monopoly to control the use and dissemination of their work. The owner of the copyright in a work has the exclusive right to exploit the economic rights. A person infringes copyright in a work when he or she, other than pursuant to a copyright licence, does any of the following \u201crestricted acts\u201d, either in relation to the work as a whole or any \u201csubstantial part\u201d of it: <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/business/intellectual-property/copyright/copyright-protection-in-new-zealand/|title=Copyright protection in New Zealand {{!}} Ministry of Business, Innovation & Employment|website=www.mbie.govt.nz|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>\n\n* copying the work\n* publishing, issuing or selling copies to the public\n* performing, playing or showing the work in public\n* broadcasting the work\n* making any work derived or adapted from the copyright work\nAnyone who wants to use someone else\u2019s work requires the permission of the right owner. The copyright owner can assign, transfer, and license the economic rights in the work.\n\n== Copyright works ==\nCopyright automatically applies (no registration required) to original works in the following categories:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Literary works (novels, poems, song lyrics, computer programming/programmes, compilations of data)\n* Dramatic works (scripts for films or plays)\n* Artistic works (paintings, plans, maps, photographs, sculptures, models, buildings)\n* Musical works (scores and arrangements)\n* Sound recordings (of musical, literary or dramatic works)\n* Films\n* Broadcasts (radio, TV, cable)\n* Typographical arrangement of published editions (this exists independent of copyright in the published work, if any)\n\nCopyright does not apply to certain government works, such as Acts of Parliament, Regulations, Parliamentary debates, Court judgments and reports of Select Committees, Royal Commissions, Commissions of Inquiry, etc.\n\n== Copyright term ==\n\nCopyright protection does not last forever. The duration of copyright protection depends on the type of work. The work will eventually enter the public domain. This means that once copyright has expired, everyone can freely use the work. Before such time permission of the rights holder is required to use a copyrighted work. New Zealand's copyright term is largely consistent with [[List of countries' copyright length|other countries]], and complies with the [[WIPO]] standard. The copyright term depends on the type of work in question. \nHere are some examples: <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works: 50 years from the death of the author\n* Sound recordings and films: 50 years from when it is available to the public\n* Broadcasts and cable: 50 years from broadcast\n* Typographical arrangements: 25 years from first publishing\n* Computer-generated work: 50 years after being made \n* Crown copyright: 100 years\n* Artistic works industrially applied: 16 years from when the work is applied\n* Artistic craftsmanship industrially applied: 25 years from when the work is applied\n\n== Exclusions and fair dealing ==\nThe Copyright Act allows for certain permitted acts to be exempted from copyright restrictions. These include: \n* [[fair dealing]] for the purpose of criticism, review, news reporting, research or private study\n* certain educational purposes\n* [[time shifting]] of TV programmes for viewing at a later time\n* [[format shifting]] of music\n* back up of computer programs\n* braille copies of literary or dramatic works\n\n== Moral rights ==\nBesides protecting the economic rights of the author, copyright law also protects the moral rights of an author. Moral rights protect the author from distortion, mutilation or other modification of the work where that act would be or is prejudicial to the reputation of the author. Moral rights are inalienably attached to the author and cannot be transferred. Some moral rights can, however, be waived. Moral rights give the author for instance the right to:\n* be identified as the author (right of attribution)\n* object to derogatory treatment of the work (right of integrity)\n* not have work falsely attributed to them\n\n== New technologies amendments ==\nIn 2001,<ref name=\"review2001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/MultipageDocumentTOC____991.aspx|title=Digital Technology and the Copyright Act 1994: A Discussion Paper|publisher=MED|date=July 2001}}</ref> the Ministry of Economic Development initiated a major review of copyright law, in light of new technologies, such as media in digital form and communications via the internet.
