It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\". A product of Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy|\"Berlin\" period]], the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his [[signature song]]s. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000).

It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\". A product of Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy|\"Berlin\" period]], the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his [[signature song]]s. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp. 90\u201392</ref>\n\nInspired by the sight of Bowie's producer-engineer Tony Visconti embracing his lover by the [[Berlin Wall]], the song tells the story of two lovers, one from [[East Berlin|East]] and one from [[West Berlin]]. Bowie's performance of {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} on [[Berlin Wall#David Bowie, 1987|June 6, 1987]], at the German [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in [[West Berlin]] has been considered a catalyst to the later [[fall of the Berlin Wall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/david-bowie-death/423483/|work=The Atlantic|last=Ford|first=Matt|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=11 January 2016|title=Remembering David Bowie|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112083919/http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/david-bowie-death/423483/|archive-date=12 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/1/11/10749546/david-bowie-berlin-wall-heroes|work=Vox|last=Fisher|first=Max|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=11 January 2016|title=David Bowie at the Berlin Wall: the incredible story of a concert and its role in history|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113052820/http://www.vox.com/2016/1/11/10749546/david-bowie-berlin-wall-heroes|archive-date=13 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-berlin-wall.com/videos/david-bowie-plays-berlin-711/|publisher=Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg|accessdate=11 January 2016|date=9 November 2014|title=The Berlin Wall \u2013 A multimedia history: David Bowie plays Berlin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114015829/http://www.the-berlin-wall.com/videos/david-bowie-plays-berlin-711/|archive-date=14 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Following his [[Death of David Bowie|death]] in January 2016, the German government thanked Bowie for \"helping to bring down the Wall\", adding \"you are now among Heroes\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/11/germany-to-david-bowie-thank-you-for-helping-to-bring-down-the-berlin-wall/ |title=Germany to David Bowie: Thank You for Helping to Bring Down the Berlin Wall |magazine=Foreign Policy |date=11 January 2016 |accessdate=12 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004130922/http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/01/11/germany-to-david-bowie-thank-you-for-helping-to-bring-down-the-berlin-wall/ |archive-date=4 October 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n{{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has received numerous accolades since its release, as seen with its inclusion on lists ranking the \"greatest songs\" compiled by various music publications; ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named the song the 46th greatest ever, and ''[[NME]]'' named it the 15th greatest.<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/david-bowie-heroes-20110525 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050101013301/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/6596661/500songs|archive-date=1 January 2005|title=The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time \u2013 November 2003|accessdate=26 September 2016 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref><ref name=\"NME500\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_500_greatest_songs_2014.htm|accessdate=15 February 2016|work=NME|title=NME The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160218133410/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/nme_500_greatest_songs_2014.htm|archive-date=18 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Pitchfork Media\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/pitchfork.htm|title=The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present|accessdate=15 January 2016|publisher=Pitchfork Media|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108135757/http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/Pitchfork.htm|archive-date=8 January 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Bowie scholar David Buckley has written that {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} \"is perhaps pop's definitive statement of the potential triumph of the human spirit over adversity\".<ref>{{cite book|author=David Buckley|title=David Bowie: The Music and The Changes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lboSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT63|year=2015|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-78323-617-6|page=63|access-date=22 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302054741/https://books.google.com/books?id=lboSCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT63|archive-date=2 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Title and lyrics==\nThe song title is a reference to the 1975 track \"[[Neu!

{"title_page": "Motets by Johann Sebastian Bach, discography", "text_new": "This article includes a list of commercial recordings of the [[Motet (Bach)|motets]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]. Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording with  the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a particular recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of a particular work. This appears to be the case with the two sets by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] conducting the [[Monteverdi Choir]]. They recorded Bach's motets without {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} in 1980, but included it in their 2011 live recording.<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are in the minority. Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]], which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. There are three possible approaches: \n*instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]'' \n*''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment\n*Some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]]\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].

The Hilliard Ensemble's OVPP version is mainly ''a capella''. They omit the instrumental parts of ''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', but sing ''Lobet den Herrn'' to organ accompaniment.<ref name=\"Guardian\"/>\n\nThe recordings with continuo accompaniment include The Sixteen's version and the second recording by the Monteverdi Choir.\n\n== History ==\nThe first of the motets to be recorded was [[Jesu, meine Freude, BWV 227|''Jesu meine Freude'']] in 1927. This version was sung in English.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas1\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec1.htm|title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 1 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 2010, Suzuki and his ensemble were given a French award ([[Diapason d'Or|Diapason d\u2019Or de l\u2019Ann\u00e9e]]) and a German award ([[Preis der deutschen Schallplattenkritik]]) for their recording of Bach motets on BIS.\n \nJohn Eliot Gardiner, who has won more [[Gramophone Classical Music Awards|Gramophone Awards]] than any other living artist, received one for his second recording of the motets with the Monteverdi Choir on SDG.

Bach motets have often been recorded as a set (typically comprising the six motets catalogued as BWV{{nbsp}}225-230).{{efn|\"BWV\" is [[Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis]], a thematic catalogue of Bach's works.}}  However, other motets are attributed to Bach and there is some doubt about the authorship of [[Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden, BWV 230|''Lobet den Herrn, alle Heiden'', BWV 230]], one of the {{abbr|BWV|Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (catalogue of Bach's works)}} \"six\".\n\nA single CD can contain the set of six motets plus other works. For example, [[Maasaki Suzuki]]'s 2009 recording with  the [[Bach Collegium Japan]] on [[BIS Records|BIS]] includes [[O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht, BWV 118|''O Jesu Christ, meins Lebens Licht'', BWV 118]] (which at one time was categorised as a cantata) and [[Ich lasse dich nicht, BWV Anh. 159|''Ich lasse dich nicht'', BWV Anh. 159]] (the authorship of which has been disputed).<ref name=\"BIS\">{{Cite web |url=https://bis.se/conductors/suzuki-masaaki/bach-motets |title=Bach Motets |website=bis.se (BIS Records) |access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref> The motets chosen for a particular recording can reflect the way the balance of opinion changes regarding the status of a particular work. This appears to be the case with the two sets by [[John Eliot Gardiner]] conducting the [[Monteverdi Choir]]. They recorded Bach's motets without {{nowrap|BWV Anh. 159}} in 1980, but included it in their 2011 live recording.<ref name=\"muzie\">[https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX11558 ''Bach: Motets''] and [https://www.muziekweb.nl/en/Link/DBX10438 ''Bach Motets''] at {{url|www.muziekweb.nl}}.</ref>\n\n== Types of choirs ==\nChoirs with [[one voice per part]] (OVPP) are used in some [[historically informed performance]]s of Bach. However, OVPP recordings of the motets are in the minority. Exceptions include the [[Hilliard Ensemble]]'s second set,<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{Cite news |last=Clements |first=Andrew |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/18/classicalmusicandopera.shopping2 |title=Bach: Motets |date=18 May 2007 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> and [[Konrad Jungh\u00e4nel]] with the group Cantus C\u00f6lln.<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas6\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec6.htm |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 6 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref>\n\nAt least some of the motets would have been first performed by singers from Leipzig's [[Thomanerchor]], which comprises boys and young men. This choir has recorded the motets (initially under [[G\u00fcnther Ramin]] in the 1950s),<ref name=\"Bach Cantatas2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bach-cantatas.com/Vocal/BWV225-231-Rec2.htm  |title= Motets / Recordings \u2013 Part 2 |website=Bach Cantatas Website}}</ref> as have other choirs with boys' voices such as the [[Choir of New College, Oxford]].<ref name=\"BachCantatas7\"/>\n\n== Instrumental accompaniment ==\nMusic directors need to make choices about the instrumental accompaniment, if any, to be used. There are three possible approaches: \n*instruments doubling the vocal lines, something which is described as playing ''[[colla parte]]'' \n*''[[a cappella]]'', that is, without an accompaniment\n*Some support for the singers from instruments such as an [[Organ (music)|organ]]\n\nSurviving sources do not make it clear what Bach's approach was to the accompaniment of most of these pieces. In the case of [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]] orchestral parts are extant, indicating that choir I was doubled by strings and choir II by reeds (two [[oboe]]s, [[Taille (instrument)|taille]] and [[bassoon]]). There is also a [[basso continuo]] (separate [[violone]] and organ parts are provided) which underlies both choirs.<ref name=\"bachchoir\">{{Cite web |url=https://bach.org/education/motet-bwv-226/ |title=Motet BWV 226 |website=Bach Choir of Bethlehem |access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref>\nAn accompaniment is also specified for ''Lobet den Herrn''.<ref name=\"Leavis\">{{cite web | url= https://www.jstor.org/stable/731829| title=Bach's Setting of Psalm CXVII (BWV.230) | publisher=OUP | work=[[Music & Letters]].
