He was twice [[World Cycling Championship|world professional road race champion]], and was the first cyclist to win all five 'Monuments': the most prestigious one-day [[Classic cycle races|classics]]&nbsp;\u2013 a feat since achieved by just two others (both also Belgians: [[Roger De Vlaeminck]] and [[Eddy Merckx]]). With 379 road victories he's second to Merckx only. He is ninth on the [[Grand Tour (cycling)#Most Grand Tour stage wins|all-time list]] of [[Grand Tour (cycling)|Grand Tour]] stage winners with thirty-seven victories.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Rik-van-loy-1273990751.jpg|thumb|upright|Van Looy in 2010]]\nVan Looy rose to prominence when he won the Belgian amateur road championship in 1952. He repeated the victory the following year, adding third place in the world title race the same year, before turning professional. At the [[1952 Summer Olympics]], he won a gold medal in the [[Cycling at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's team road race|team road race]] event.<ref name=\"sports-reference\">{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/va/rik-van-looy-1.html |title=Rik Van Looy Olympic Results |accessdate=2012-12-29 |work=sports-reference.com}}</ref>\n\nA powerful [[cycling sprinter|sprinter]], Van Looy won two races in what was left of his first professional season (1953), and 20 more over the next couple of seasons. In 1956, his victories included [[Gent\u2013Wevelgem]] and [[Paris\u2013Brussels]], plus two stages and overall victory in the Tour of the [[Netherlands]]. He also won a silver medal in the world road race championship, behind his countryman [[Rik Van Steenbergen]]. He repeated his Gent\u2013Wevelgem and [[Ronde van Nederland|Tour of the Netherlands]] victories in 1957, and in 1958 won the season's opening classic, [[Milan\u2013San Remo]].\n\n1959 saw Van Looy take the early-season [[Tour of Flanders]] and the autumn classic, the [[Giro di Lombardia]]. In between, he scored another 38 victories, including three stages of the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] (finishing third overall and winner of the points competition) and four stages of the [[Giro d'Italia]] (for 4th overall).\n\nIn 1960, he scored the first of two consecutive victories in the world road race championship, but Classic victories eluded him. However, he made up for this in 1961, winning both [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]] and [[Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge]] \u2013 making him the first rider to take all five 'Monuments' \u2013 as well as retaining his rainbow world title jersey, and taking three stages, plus the mountains competition, in the Giro.\n\nVan Looy scored two more Classic wins in 1962 (Paris\u2013Roubaix, Tour of Flanders), took another Gent\u2013Wevelgem, and two more Giro stages. In 1963 Van Looy rode the [[Tour de France]], taking four stages en route to victory in the points competition and a 10th place on general classification; he also grabbed a silver in the world title race. In the latter race, held in [[Ronse]] in his native Belgium, he was beaten in the sprint by his countryman [[Benoni Beheyt]]. Van Looy, starting the sprint too early, did not take this defeat lightly. This race has remained memorable in the history of Belgian cycling.\n\nIn 1965, he scored 42 victories including Paris\u2013Roubaix, and eight stages of the Vuelta on his way to his second third place overall (his highest placing in a Grand Tour). For good measure, he also took two stages in the Tour de France.\n\nDuring the final years of his career (1966\u20131970), Van Looy's road performances began to fade, as the new Belgian star Eddy Merckx rose to prominence, but he still grabbed second in the 1967 Paris\u2013Roubaix, won [[La Fl\u00e8che Wallonne]] in 1968, and took a stage of the 1969 Tour de France. His rivalry with [[Eddy Merckx]] reached the height of sabotage of Merckx in the world championships in 1969.<ref>{{cite book|last=Van Walleghem|first=Rik|title=Eddy Merckx:the greatest cyclist of the 20th century|publisher=Pinguin Productions|year=1993|isbn=1-884737-72-2}}</ref>\n\nVan Looy was also a star on the track, winning 11 [[six-day racing|Six-day races]]. His first came in [[Brussels]] in 1957, his last in Antwerp in 1968. For nine of these victories, he was paired with [[Netherlands|Dutchman]] [[Peter Post]].\n\n==Major results==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n;1952\n:{{BEL}} national amateur road race

The typesetting system offers programmable [[desktop publishing]] features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, the inclusion of graphics, page layout, indexing and [[bibliography|bibliographies]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://mathvault.ca/latex-guide/|title=The Definitive, Non-Technical Introduction to LaTeX, Professional Typesetting and Scientific Publishing|date=2015-09-05|website=Math Vault|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref>\n\nLike TeX, LaTeX started as a writing tool for mathematicians and computer scientists, but even from early in its development, it has also been taken up by scholars who needed to write documents that include complex math expressions or non-Latin scripts, such as Arabic, Sanskrit and Chinese.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://scholar.harvard.edu/dromney/arabic-latex|title=Arabic in LaTeX|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\nLaTeX is intended to provide a high-level, descriptive markup language that accesses the power of TeX in an easier way for writers. In essence, TeX handles the layout side, while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing. LaTeX comprises a collection of TeX [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] and a program to process LaTeX documents, and because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary, it provides authors with ready-made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies.\n\nLaTeX was originally written in the early 1980s by [[Leslie Lamport]] at [[SRI International]].<ref>{{cite web | url=//research.microsoft.com/users/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#latex | title=The Writings of Leslie Lamport: LaTeX: A Document Preparation System | author=Leslie Lamport | date=April 23, 2007 | work=Leslie Lamport's Home Page | accessdate=2007-04-27}}</ref> The current version is LaTeX2e (stylised as <span class=\"texhtml\" style=\"font-family: 'CMU Serif', cmr10, LMRoman10-Regular, 'Latin Modern Math', 'Nimbus Roman No9 L', 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\">L<span style=\"text-transform: uppercase; font-size: 0.75em; vertical-align: 0.25em; margin-left: -0.36em; margin-right: -0.15em; line-height: 1ex;\">a</span>T<span style=\"text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: -0.5ex; margin-left: -0.1667em; margin-right: -0.125em; line-height: 1ex;\">e</span>X<span style=\"margin-left: 0.15em;\">2</span><span style=\"font-style: italic; vertical-align: -0.35ex; line-height: 1ex;\">\u03b5</span></span>).

In preparing a LaTeX document, the author specifies the logical structure using simple, familiar concepts such as ''chapter'', ''section'', ''table'', ''figure'', etc., and lets the LaTeX system handle the formatting and layout of these structures. As a result, it encourages the separation of the layout from the content \u2014 while still allowing manual typesetting adjustments whenever needed. This concept is similar to the mechanism by which many [[word processor]]s allow styles to be defined globally for an entire document, or the use of [[Cascading Style Sheets]] in styling [[HTML|HTML documents]].\n\nThe LaTeX system is a [[markup language]] that handles typesetting and rendering<ref>The design of LaTeX owes something to earlier markup systems such as [[Scribe (markup language)|Scribe]].</ref>, and can be arbitrarily extended by using the underlying [[macro language]] to develop custom macros such as new environments and commands. Such macros are often collected into ''packages,'' which could then be made available to address some specific typesetting needs such as the formatting of complex mathematical expressions or graphics<ref name=\":0\" /> (e.g., the use of the <code>align</code> environment provided by the <code>amsmath</code> package to produce aligned equations).\n\nIn order to create a document in LaTeX, you first write a file, say <code>document.tex</code>, using your preferred [[text editor]]. Then you give your <code>document.tex</code> file as input to the TeX program (with the LaTeX macros loaded), which prompts TeX to write out a file suitable for onscreen viewing or printing.<ref>PDF output is common, but TeX can output other formats such as DVI (\"Device independent\" format).  See below for more detail about outputs.</ref> This write-format-preview cycle is one of the chief ways in which working with LaTeX differs from the [[WYSIWYG|What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get]] (WYSIWYG) style of document editing. It is similar to the code-compile-execute cycle known to the computer programmers. Today, many LaTeX-aware editing programs make this cycle a simple matter through the pressing a single key, while showing the output preview on the screen beside the input window. Some online LaTeX editors even automatically refresh the preview,<ref>{{cite web |url = //www.overleaf.com | title = Overleaf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = //www.seeveeze.com/ | title = Seeveeze}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = //latexbase.com | title = LaTeX Base}}</ref> while other online tools provide incremental editing in-place, mixed in with the preview in a streamlined single window.<ref>{{cite web | url = //www.authorea.com/ | title = Authorea}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nThe example below shows the LaTeX input and corresponding output:\n<!-- Don't change the source code unless you know what you are doing and have checked that the output is the same or has been updated. -->\n\n<div class=\"noresize\" style=\"overflow-x:auto\">\n{| class=wikitable\n!

The LPPL is [[Debian Free Software Guidelines|DFSG]] compliant as of version 1.3. As [[free software]], LaTeX is available on most operating systems, which include [[UNIX]] ([[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]], [[AIX]]), [[BSD]] ([[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]]), [[Linux]] ([[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|Red Hat]], [[Debian]], [[Arch Linux|Arch]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]), [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[DOS]], [[RISC OS]], [[AmigaOS]] and [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan9]].\n\n==Related software==\n\nAs a macro package, LaTeX provides a set of macros for TeX to interpret. There are many other macro packages for TeX, including Plain TeX, [[GNU Texinfo]], [[AMSTeX]], and [[ConTeXt]].\n\nWhen TeX \"compiles\" a document, it follows (from the user's point of view) the following processing sequence: Macros \u2192 TeX \u2192 Driver \u2192 Output. Different implementations of each of these steps are typically available in TeX distributions. Traditional TeX will output a [[DVI (file format)|DVI]] file, which is usually converted to a [[PostScript]] file. More recently, [[H\u00e0n Th\u1ebf Th\u00e0nh]] and others have written a new implementation of TeX called [[pdfTeX]], which also outputs to [[PDF]] and takes advantage of features available in that format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/|title=pdfTeX - TeX Users Group|website=www.tug.org|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref> The [[XeTeX]] engine developed by Jonathan Kew, on the other hand, merges modern font technologies and Unicode with TeX.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tug.org/xetex/|title=XeTeX - TeX Users Group|website=www.tug.org|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref>\n\nThe default font for LaTeX is Knuth's [[Computer Modern]], which gives default documents created with LaTeX the same distinctive look as those created with plain TeX. XeTeX allows the use of OpenType and TrueType (that is, outlined) fonts for output files.\n\nThere are also many editors for LaTeX, some of which are offline, source-code-based while others are online, partial-WYSIWYG-based.

Additionally, TeX documents can be shared by rendering the LaTeX file to [[Rich Text Format]] (<code>*.rtf</code>) or [[XML]]. This can be done using the free software programs LaTeX2RTF or [[TeX4ht]]. LaTeX can also be rendered to PDF files using the LaTeX extension pdfLaTeX. LaTeX files containing Unicode text can be processed into PDFs with the <code>inputenc</code> package, or by the TeX extensions XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.\n* HeVeA is a converter written in [[Ocaml]] that converts LaTeX documents to [[HTML5]].

In essence, TeX handles the layout side, while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing.

In preparing a LaTeX document, the author specifies the logical structure using simple, familiar concepts such as ''chapter'', ''section'', ''table'', ''figure'', etc., and lets the LaTeX system handle the formatting and layout of these structures. As a result, it encourages the separation of the layout from the content \u2014 while still allowing manual typesetting adjustments whenever needed. This concept is similar to the mechanism by which many [[word processor]]s allow styles to be defined globally for an entire document, or the use of [[Cascading Style Sheets]] in styling [[HTML|HTML documents]].\n\nThe LaTeX system is a [[markup language]] that handles typesetting and rendering<ref>The design of LaTeX owes something to earlier markup systems such as [[Scribe (markup language)|Scribe]].</ref>, and can be arbitrarily extended by using the underlying [[macro language]] to develop custom macros such as new environments and commands. Such macros are often collected into ''packages,'' which could then be made available to address some specific typesetting needs such as the formatting of complex mathematical expressions or graphics<ref name=\":0\" /> (e.g., the use of the <code>align</code> environment provided by the <code>amsmath</code> package to produce aligned equations).\n\nIn order to create a document in LaTeX, you first write a file, say <code>document.tex</code>, using your preferred [[text editor]]. Then you give your <code>document.tex</code> file as input to the TeX program (with the LaTeX macros loaded), which prompts TeX to write out a file suitable for onscreen viewing or printing.<ref>PDF output is common, but TeX can output other formats such as DVI (\"Device independent\" format).  See below for more detail about outputs.</ref> This write-format-preview cycle is one of the chief ways in which working with LaTeX differs from the [[WYSIWYG|What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get]] (WYSIWYG) style of document editing.

The LPPL is [[Debian Free Software Guidelines|DFSG]] compliant as of version 1.3. As [[free software]], LaTeX is available on most operating systems, which include [[UNIX]] ([[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[HP-UX]], [[AIX]]), [[BSD]] ([[FreeBSD]], [[macOS]], [[NetBSD]], [[OpenBSD]]), [[Linux]] ([[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|Red Hat]], [[Debian]], [[Arch Linux|Arch]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]), [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[DOS]], [[RISC OS]], [[AmigaOS]] and [[Plan 9 from Bell Labs|Plan9]].\n\n==Related software==\n\nAs a macro package, LaTeX provides a set of macros for TeX to interpret. There are many other macro packages for TeX, including Plain TeX, [[GNU Texinfo]], [[AMSTeX]], and [[ConTeXt]].\n\nWhen TeX \"compiles\" a document, it follows (from the user's point of view) the following processing sequence: Macros \u2192 TeX \u2192 Driver \u2192 Output. Different implementations of each of these steps are typically available in TeX distributions. Traditional TeX will output a [[DVI (file format)|DVI]] file, which is usually converted to a [[PostScript]] file. More recently, [[H\u00e0n Th\u1ebf Th\u00e0nh]] and others have written a new implementation of TeX called [[pdfTeX]], which also outputs to [[PDF]] and takes advantage of features available in that format.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/|title=pdfTeX - TeX Users Group|website=www.tug.org|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref> The [[XeTeX]] engine developed by Jonathan Kew, on the other hand, merges modern font technologies and Unicode with TeX.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tug.org/xetex/|title=XeTeX - TeX Users Group|website=www.tug.org|access-date=2019-07-20}}</ref>\n\nThe default font for LaTeX is Knuth's [[Computer Modern]], which gives default documents created with LaTeX the same distinctive look as those created with plain TeX. XeTeX allows the use of OpenType and TrueType (that is, outlined) fonts for output files.\n\nThere are also many editors for LaTeX, some of which are offline, source-code-based while others are online, partial-WYSIWYG-based. For more, see [[Comparison of TeX editors]].\n\n==Versions==\n{{Infobox file format\n| name =\n| icon =\n| iconcaption =\n| icon_size =\n| screenshot =\n| screenshot_size =\n| caption =\n|_noextcode =\n| extension =  .tex<!-- or: | extensions = -->\n|_nomimecode =\n| mime = application/x-latex {{refn|name=Unreg|group=Note|[[Media type#Unregistered tree|Unregistered media type]]}}\n| type code =\n| uniform_type =\n| conforms_to =\n| magic =\n| developer =\n| released =                <!-- {{start date and age|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes/no}} -->\n| latest_release_version = LaTeX2e\n| latest_release_date = 1994<!-- {{start date and age|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes/no}} -->\n| genre = [[Document file format]]\n| container_for =\n| contained_by =\n| extended_from =\n| extended_to =\n| standard =                <!-- or: | standards = -->\n| free =\n}}\nLaTeX2e is the current version of LaTeX, since it replaced LaTeX 2.09 in 1994<ref name=\":1\" />. {{As of|2019||df=}}, LaTeX3, which started in the early 1990s, is under a long-term development project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latex-project.org/latex3/|title=The LaTeX3 Project|website=www.latex-project.org|access-date=2018-12-26}}</ref> Planned features include improved syntax, [[hyperlink]] support, a new user interface, access to arbitrary fonts and a new documentation.<ref>{{cite web | url=//www.latex-project.org/guides/ltx3info.pdf | title=The LaTeX3 Project | author=Frank Mittelbach, Chris Rowley | date=January 12, 1999 | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-07-30}}</ref>\n\nThere are numerous commercial implementations of the entire TeX system.

They consist of plain text and do not contain hidden formatting codes or binary instructions. Additionally, TeX documents can be shared by rendering the LaTeX file to [[Rich Text Format]] (<code>*.rtf</code>) or [[XML]]. This can be done using the free software programs LaTeX2RTF or [[TeX4ht]]. LaTeX can also be rendered to PDF files using the LaTeX extension pdfLaTeX. LaTeX files containing Unicode text can be processed into PDFs with the <code>inputenc</code> package, or by the TeX extensions XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX.\n* HeVeA is a converter written in [[Ocaml]] that converts LaTeX documents to [[HTML5]].

He needed to write TeX macros for his own use, and thought that with a little extra effort he could make a general package usable by others.

Later, in 2018, Taylor and Blumhouse Productions began developing the film, with Taylor directing, Landes writing, Blum producing and Spencer starring it. [[Principal photography]] on the film started in February 2018 and wrapped in March 2018, in [[Mississippi]], with parts shot in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].\n\n''Ma'' was released in the United States on May 31, 2019, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It has grossed $61.1 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, the horror elements and Spencer's performance, but criticized the teenage characters, slow pacing and story. Both critics and audiences said the film did not take full advantage of its premise.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenager Maggie Thompson moves with her mother Erica to her [[Ohio]] hometown after Erica's husband leaves her. At her new high school, Maggie befriends Haley, Darrell, Chaz, and Andy, who immediately develops a crush on her. They convince Sue Ann \"Ma\" Ellington, a [[veterinary technician]], to [[Shoulder tap (alcohol)|help them buy alcohol]] because they are underage. Sue Ann anonymously reports the teenagers' activities, but they are released because of the officer's history with Andy's father, Ben. The next day, Sue Ann invites the teenagers to drink in her basement. The next time they go, Sue Ann has decorated her basement and lots of other teenagers show up at her house to party, making her popular among the students.\n\nHowever, her hospitality starts to annoy the group as she continuously harasses them to engage in various activities with her. One night, Sue Ann sees Andy and Maggie kissing and becomes jealous (as she is in love with him, having had a crush on his father, Ben, in high school). She drugs Maggie immediately after and takes her earrings. The next morning, Maggie wakes up and notices her earrings are missing and is badly bruised and cut. Scared, Maggie tells Andy that she does not want to go to her house anymore and that she does not want him to go as well and he agrees.\n\nOne day to earn the group's trust back, Ma meets with them to tell them that she has [[pancreatic cancer]] (which is a lie) and that is why she acts the way she does. As she is talking, Haley notices that she is wearing a bracelet that belongs to a friend of theirs. The girls suspect that Sue Ann has been stealing their jewelry so they go to her house to investigate. They are surprised by Genie, Sue Ann's daughter from a failed marriage, who Maggie thought used a wheelchair, but she is clearly able-bodied. She warns them as Sue Ann arrives home, and they narrowly escape.\n\nBen warns Sue Ann to stay away from Andy, calling her pathetic. A flashback reveals that Sue Ann, who had a crush on Ben in high school, performed [[fellatio]] on him in a closet. Once she left the closet, it turned out that she had been doing it to another boy and Ben had tricked her. Ben had gotten the entire school to witness the event (including his current girlfriend Mercedes and a young Erica), and Sue Ann suffered devastating humiliation, which she never recovered from.\n\nBen shows up at Sue Ann\u2019s job, to drop off his car and invites her out for drinks after work. Sue Ann goes home to change and meets him at the bar, where Ben confronts Sue Ann with a tracking device and asks her why his son has been at her house so much. \n\nAn increasingly unstable Sue Ann runs over Mercedes with her truck, killing her. She kills her boss, draws blood from Maggie's dog Louie, and lures Ben to her house, where she knocks him out. Ben wakes up trapped in her bed; Sue Ann pumps Louie's blood into his body, slashes his wrist, and leaves him to die. Maggie tells her mother the truth about Sue Ann and is grounded. Sue Ann sends Maggie a picture of herself with Andy in her basement at Chaz's birthday party. Hurt that he went back to her house despite promising that he would not go back, she sneaks out of the house to confront him. When she arrives, she notices that everyone has left and that only the original group remain. She tries to get Andy to leave but soon realizes that Andy and the rest of her friends have been drugged. Maggie tries to get help and in the process finds Ben's body. As she stands there in horror, Sue Ann renders her unconscious.\n\nMaggie awakens chained in the basement. Sue Ann irons Chaz's stomach, sews Haley's mouth shut, and paints Darrell's face white with industrial paint, because she feels there is only room for one black person in the group, and that is her. Andy awakens, and tries to seduce Sue Ann, as he is well aware that she is in love with him. He tries to trick her by telling her that he loves her and kisses her but she stabs him after knowing that he is lying. An officer arrives and when Maggie screams for help, Sue Ann shoots the officer dead before he can react. She then gathers the four friends around the couch with her and makes Maggie take photos of them together in a crude recreation of what Sue Ann always longed for but never had. Sue Ann then leaves Maggie to be hanged before Genie intervenes. Everyone else wakes up to discover what Sue Ann has done to them but barely have time to react as the house is on fire and need to find a way out. Erica, knowing where Maggie would be, calls her co-worker Stu for help and the two save the teenagers. Sue Ann attempts to throw Genie into the fire, blaming Erica for not stopping Ben from pulling the prank in school. Maggie stabs Sue Ann, saving Genie.\n\nThe group goes outside and assess what has happened. Sue Ann watches them, particularly Andy who survived the stabbing and is lying down next to Maggie. Sue Ann walks upstairs and lies down next to Ben's body, cuddling with it as the house burns.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Sue Ann \"Ma\" Ellington\n** Kyanna Simone Simpson as young Sue Ann\n* [[Diana Silvers]] as Maggie Thompson\n* [[McKaley Miller]] as Haley, Maggie's friend\n* Corey Fogelmanis as Andy Hawkins, Maggie\u2019s boyfriend\n* [[Juliette Lewis]] as Erica Thompson\n** Teagan Edsell  as young Erica\n* [[Luke Evans]] as Ben Hawkins\n** Andrew Matthew Welch as young Ben\n* Gianni Paolo as Chaz, Maggie's friend\n* Dante Brown as Darrell, Maggie's friend\n* [[Missi Pyle]] as Mercedes, Ben's girlfriend\n** Nicole Carpenter as young Mercedes \n* Tanyell Waivers as Genie Ellington\n* [[Allison Janney]] as Dr. Brooks, Sue Ann's boss\n* [[Dominic Burgess]] as Stu, Erica's co-worker\n* Heather Marie Pate as Ashley\n* [[Tate Taylor]] as Officer Grainger\n* Victor Turpin as Pietro Kramer\n* Margaret Fegan as Stephanie\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Ma'' came together as a result of [[Tate Taylor]]'s desire to direct a film about \"something fucked up,\" and a conversation he had with [[Octavia Spencer]] in which she told him that she was \"sick of only being offered the same role and never getting to be a lead.\"<ref name=indiewire1/> The two are longtime friends, having worked together in films such as ''[[The Help (film)|The Help]]'' and ''[[Get on Up (film)|Get on Up]]''.<ref name=indiewire1/> [[Jason Blum]] and Taylor, who have been friends for a few years, knew each other socially.<ref name=gq/>\n\nTaylor went to Blum's office, reiterating, {{Quote|\"I want to do something really fucked up.\"<ref name=gq/>}} He read Scotty Landes' script of the film, which [[Blumhouse Productions]] had bought the day before.<ref name=gq/> Although the original draft was written with a white woman in the title role, Taylor immediately thought about Spencer.<ref name=indiewire1/> He went out to the hall, called Spencer, and asked her if she would like to be in a horror film;<ref name=gq/> without reading the script, Spencer boarded the project.<ref name=gq>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/ma-tate-taylor-interview|title=The Director of Ma Will Not Let You Pee|work=[[GQ]]|first=Max|last=Cea|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere was no backstory for the title character in the original script, which made her \"a complete monster that no audience member could sympathize with.\"<ref name=indiewire1/> The filmmakers made it a priority to come up with an authentic backstory for the role.<ref name=indiewire1>{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/ma-octavia-spencer-pitch-black-person-killed-first-1202145955/|title=Octavia Spencer Got Pitched 'Ma' and Asked: 'Am I the Black Person Who Gets Killed First?'|work=[[IndieWire]]|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=May 30, 2019|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref> Taylor thought it was important to weave the themes of trauma, the sins of our parents, and how we treat people into the story to create a character audiences can relate to and feel bad for.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/05/ma-octavia-spencer-pitch-black-person-killed-first-1202145955/|title=Octavia Spencer Got Pitched \u2018Ma\u2019 and Asked: \u2018Am I the Black Person Who Gets Killed First?\u2019|last=Sharf|first=Zack|date=2019-05-30|website=IndieWire|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\n[[Principal photography]] on the film started in February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/octavia-spencer-ma-blumhouse-tate-taylor-movie-juliette-lewis-luke-evans-1202276253/|title=Octavia Spencer To Star In Blumhouse Thriller 'Ma';

Later, in 2018, Taylor and Blumhouse Productions began developing the film, with Taylor directing, Landes writing, Blum producing and Spencer starring it. [[Principal photography]] on the film started in February 2018 and wrapped in March 2018, in [[Mississippi]], with parts shot in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]].\n\n''Ma'' was released in the United States on May 31, 2019, by [[Universal Pictures]]. It has grossed $61.1 million worldwide and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the atmosphere, the horror elements and Spencer's performance, but criticized the teenage characters, slow pacing and story. Both critics and audiences said the film did not take full advantage of its premise.\n\n==Plot==\nTeenager Maggie Thompson moves with her mother Erica to her [[Ohio]] hometown after Erica's husband leaves her. At her new high school, Maggie befriends Haley, Darrell, Chaz, and Andy, who immediately develops a crush on her. They convince Sue Ann \"Ma\" Ellington, a [[veterinary technician]], to [[Shoulder tap (alcohol)|help them buy alcohol]] because they are underage. Sue Ann anonymously reports the teenagers' activities, but they are released because of the officer's history with Andy's father, Ben. The next day, Sue Ann invites the teenagers to drink in her basement. The next time they go, Sue Ann has decorated her basement and lots of other teenagers show up at her house to party, making her popular among the students.\n\nHowever, her hospitality starts to annoy the group as she continuously harasses them to engage in various activities with her. One night, Sue Ann sees Andy and Maggie kissing and becomes jealous (as she is in love with him, having had a crush on his father, Ben, in high school). She drugs Maggie immediately after and takes her earrings. The next morning, Maggie wakes up and notices her earrings are missing and is badly bruised and cut. Scared, Maggie tells Andy that she does not want to go to her house anymore and that she does not want him to go as well and he agrees.\n\nOne day to earn the group's trust back, Ma meets with them to tell them that she has [[pancreatic cancer]] (which is a lie) and that is why she acts the way she does. As she is talking, Haley notices that she is wearing a bracelet that belongs to a friend of theirs. The girls suspect that Sue Ann has been stealing their jewelry so they go to her house to investigate. They are surprised by Genie, Sue Ann's daughter from a failed marriage, who Maggie thought used a wheelchair, but she is clearly able-bodied. She warns them as Sue Ann arrives home, and they narrowly escape.\n\nBen warns Sue Ann to stay away from Andy, calling her pathetic. A flashback reveals that Sue Ann, who had a crush on Ben in high school, performed [[fellatio]] on him in a closet. Once she left the closet, it turned out that she had been doing it to another boy and Ben had tricked her. Ben had gotten the entire school to witness the event (including his current girlfriend Mercedes and a young Erica), and Sue Ann suffered devastating humiliation, which she never recovered from.\n\nBen shows up at Sue Ann\u2019s job, to drop off his car and invites her out for drinks after work. Sue Ann goes home to change and meets him at the bar, where Ben confronts Sue Ann with a tracking device and asks her why his son has been at her house so much. \n\nAn increasingly unstable Sue Ann runs over Mercedes with her truck, killing her. She kills her boss, draws blood from Maggie's dog Louie, and lures Ben to her house, where she knocks him out. Ben wakes up trapped in her bed; Sue Ann pumps Louie's blood into his body, slashes his wrist, and leaves him to die. Maggie tells her mother the truth about Sue Ann and is grounded. Sue Ann sends Maggie a picture of herself with Andy in her basement at Chaz's birthday party. Hurt that he went back to her house despite promising that he would not go back, she sneaks out of the house to confront him. When she arrives, she notices that everyone has left and that only the original group remain. She tries to get Andy to leave but soon realizes that Andy and the rest of her friends have been drugged. Maggie tries to get help and in the process finds Ben's body. As she stands there in horror, Sue Ann renders her unconscious.\n\nMaggie awakens chained in the basement. Sue Ann irons Chaz's stomach, sews Haley's mouth shut, and paints Darrell's face white with industrial paint, because she feels there is only room for one black person in the group, and that is her. Andy awakens, and tries to seduce Sue Ann, as he is well aware that she is in love with him. He tries to trick her by telling her that he loves her and kisses her but she stabs him after knowing that he is lying. An officer arrives and when Maggie screams for help, Sue Ann shoots the officer dead before he can react. She then gathers the four friends around the couch with her and makes Maggie take photos of them together in a crude recreation of what Sue Ann always longed for but never had. Sue Ann then leaves Maggie to be hanged before Genie intervenes. Everyone else wakes up to discover what Sue Ann has done to them but barely have time to react as the house is on fire and need to find a way out. Erica, knowing where Maggie would be, calls her co-worker Stu for help and the two save the teenagers.
