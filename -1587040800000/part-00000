Females possess a pair of ovaries, while males possess a pair of testes located dorsally in relation to the digestive tract. Reproduction involves [[external fertilization|external fertilisation]] after \"a brief courtship\". Only males care for laid eggs and young.\n\nThe larva has a blind gut and the body consists of a head and its three pairs of cephalic appendages only: the chelifores, palps and ovigers. The abdomen and the thorax with its thoracic appendages develop later. One theory is that this reflects how a common ancestor of all arthropods evolved; starting its life as a small animal with a pair of appendages used for feeding and two pairs used for locomotion, while new segments and segmental appendages were gradually added as it was growing.\n\nAt least four types of larvae have been described: the typical protonymphon larva, the encysted larva, the atypical protonymphon larva, and the attaching larva. The typical protonymphon larva is most common, is free living and gradually turns into an adult. The encysted larva is a parasite that hatches from the egg and finds a host in the shape of a polyp colony where it burrows into and turns into a cyst, and will not leave the host before it has turned into a young juvenile.\n\nLittle is known about the development of the atypical protonymphon larva. The adults are free living, while the larvae and the juveniles are living on or inside temporary hosts such as polychaetes and clams. When the attaching larva hatches it still looks like an embryo, and immediately attaches itself to the ovigerous legs of the father, where it will stay until it has turned into a small and young juvenile with two or three pairs of walking legs ready for a free-living existence.\n\n==Distribution and ecology==\n[[File:Pycnogonid.jpg|thumb|A pycnogonid in its natural habitat]]\nThese small animals live in many different parts of the world, from [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Pacific]] coast of the [[United States]], to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]], to the north and south poles. They are most common in shallow waters, but can be found as deep as {{convert|7000|m}}, and live in both marine and estuarine habitats. Pycnogonids are well camouflaged beneath the rocks and among the [[algae]] that are found along shorelines.\n\nSea spiders either walk along the bottom with their stilt-like legs or swim just above it using an umbrella pulsing motion.<ref>[http://deepseanews.blogspot.com/2006/08/sea-spiders.html Deep-Sea News: Sea Spiders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sea spiders are mostly [[carnivorous]] [[predator]]s or [[scavenger]]s that feed on [[cnidarian]]s, [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[polychaete]]s, and [[bryozoa]]ns. Although they can feed by inserting their [[proboscis]] into [[sea anemone]]s, which are much larger, most sea anemones survive this ordeal, making the sea spider a [[parasite]] rather than a predator of anemones.\n\n==Classification==\nThe class Pycnogonida comprises over 1,300 species, which are normally split into eighty-six genera. The correct taxonomy within the group is uncertain, and it appears that no agreed list of [[order (biology)|orders]] exists. Accordingly, [[family (biology)|families]] are listed in the [[Wikipedia:How to read a taxobox|taxobox]], all considered part of the single order Pantopoda.\n\nSea spiders have long been considered to belong to the [[Chelicerata]], together with [[horseshoe crab]]s, and the [[Arachnida]], which includes [[spider]]s, [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[harvestmen]], among other, lesser known orders.<ref name=\"Margulis & Schwartz\">{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author-link=Lynn Margulis |last2=Schwartz |first2=Karlene |author2-link= |title=Five Kingdoms, An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth |publisher=W.H.

This theory contends that the sea spider's chelifores, which are unique among extant arthropods, are not in any way homologous to the chelicerae in real chelicerates, as was previously supposed. Instead of developing from the [[deutocerebrum]], they can be traced to the [[protocerebrum]], the anterior part of the [[arthropod brain]] and found in the first head segment that in all other arthropods give rise to the eyes only. This is not found anywhere else among arthropods, except in some fossil forms like ''[[Anomalocaris]]'', indicating that the Pycnogonida may be a sister group to all other living arthropods, the latter having evolved from some ancestor that had lost the protocerebral appendages.

One theory is that this reflects how a common ancestor of all arthropods evolved; starting its life as a small animal with a pair of appendages used for feeding and two pairs used for locomotion, while new segments and segmental appendages were gradually added as it was growing.\n\nAt least four types of larvae have been described: the typical protonymphon larva, the encysted larva, the atypical protonymphon larva, and the attaching larva. The typical protonymphon larva is most common, is free living and gradually turns into an adult. The encysted larva is a parasite that hatches from the egg and finds a host in the shape of a polyp colony where it burrows into and turns into a cyst, and will not leave the host before it has turned into a young juvenile.\n\nLittle is known about the development of the atypical protonymphon larva. The adults are free living, while the larvae and the juveniles are living on or inside temporary hosts such as polychaetes and clams. When the attaching larva hatches it still looks like an embryo, and immediately attaches itself to the ovigerous legs of the father, where it will stay until it has turned into a small and young juvenile with two or three pairs of walking legs ready for a free-living existence.\n\n==Distribution and ecology==\n[[File:Pycnogonid.jpg|thumb|A pycnogonid in its natural habitat]]\nThese small animals live in many different parts of the world, from [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[Pacific]] coast of the [[United States]], to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]], to the north and south poles. They are most common in shallow waters, but can be found as deep as {{convert|7000|m}}, and live in both marine and estuarine habitats. Pycnogonids are well camouflaged beneath the rocks and among the [[algae]] that are found along shorelines.\n\nSea spiders either walk along the bottom with their stilt-like legs or swim just above it using an umbrella pulsing motion.<ref>[http://deepseanews.blogspot.com/2006/08/sea-spiders.html Deep-Sea News: Sea Spiders<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Sea spiders are mostly [[carnivorous]] [[predator]]s or [[scavenger]]s that feed on [[cnidarian]]s, [[sea sponge|sponges]], [[polychaete]]s, and [[bryozoa]]ns. Although they can feed by inserting their [[proboscis]] into [[sea anemone]]s, which are much larger, most sea anemones survive this ordeal, making the sea spider a [[parasite]] rather than a predator of anemones.\n\n==Classification==\nThe class Pycnogonida comprises over 1,300 species, which are normally split into eighty-six genera. The correct taxonomy within the group is uncertain, and it appears that no agreed list of [[order (biology)|orders]] exists. Accordingly, [[family (biology)|families]] are listed in the [[Wikipedia:How to read a taxobox|taxobox]], all considered part of the single order Pantopoda.\n\nSea spiders have long been considered to belong to the [[Chelicerata]], together with [[horseshoe crab]]s, and the [[Arachnida]], which includes [[spider]]s, [[mite]]s, [[tick]]s, [[scorpion]]s, and [[harvestmen]], among other, lesser known orders.<ref name=\"Margulis & Schwartz\">{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |author-link=Lynn Margulis |last2=Schwartz |first2=Karlene |author2-link= |title=Five Kingdoms, An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth |publisher=W.H.

This theory contends that the sea spider's chelifores, which are unique among extant arthropods, are not in any way homologous to the chelicerae in real chelicerates, as was previously supposed. Instead of developing from the [[deutocerebrum]], they can be traced to the [[protocerebrum]], the anterior part of the [[arthropod brain]] and found in the first head segment that in all other arthropods give rise to the eyes only. This is not found anywhere else among arthropods, except in some fossil forms like ''[[Anomalocaris]]'', indicating that the Pycnogonida may be a sister group to all other living arthropods, the latter having evolved from some ancestor that had lost the protocerebral appendages. If this is confirmed, it would mean the sea spiders are the last surviving (and highly modified) members of an ancient stem group of arthropods that lived in [[Cambrian]] oceans.<ref name=\"Maxmen\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature03984 |pmid=16237442 |title=Neuroanatomy of sea spiders implies an appendicular origin of the protocerebral segment |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7062 |pages=1144\u20138 |year=2005 |last1=Maxmen |first1=Amy |last2=Browne |first2=William E. |last3=Martindale |first3=Mark Q. |last4=Giribet |first4=Gonzalo |bibcode=2005Natur.437.1144M }}</ref> However, a subsequent study using [[Hox gene]] expression patterns consistent with a developmental homology between chelicerates and chelifores, with chelifores innervated from a deuterocerebrum that has been rotated forwards; thus, the protocerebral Great Appendage clade does not include the Pycnogonida.<ref name=\"Jager\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04591 |pmid=16724066 |title=Homology of arthropod anterior appendages revealed by Hox gene expression in a sea spider |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=506\u20138 |year=2006 |last1=Jager |first1=Muriel |last2=Murienne |first2=J\u00e9r\u00f4me |last3=Clabaut |first3=C\u00e9line |last4=Deutsch |first4=Jean |last5=Guyader |first5=Herv\u00e9 Le |last6=Manuel |first6=Micha\u00ebl |bibcode=2006Natur.441..506J }}</ref><ref name=\"PZ Myers\">[http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2006/05/26/chelifores-chelicerae-and-inve Pharyngula] {{self-published inline|date=March 2015}}</ref>\n\nRecent work places the Pycnogonida outside the [[Arachnomorpha]] as basal [[Euarthropoda]], or inside [[Chelicerata]] (based on the [[chelifore]]-[[chelicera]] putative [[Homology (biology)|homology]]).<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.2004.00284.x |title=Pycnogonid affinities: A review |journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research |volume=43 |pages=8\u201321 |year=2005 |last1=Dunlop |first1=J.

Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper {{lang|fr|[[Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle]]}} for its children's supplement {{lang|fr|[[Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me]]}}, it was serialised weekly from August 1938 to August 1939. Herg\u00e9 intended the story as a satirical criticism of the expansionist policies of [[Nazi Germany]], in particular the [[annexation]] of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] in March 1938 (the ''[[Anschluss]]''). The story tells of young Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], who travel to the fictional Balkan nation of [[Syldavia]], where they combat a plot to overthrow the monarchy of [[King Muskar XII]].\n\n''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was a commercial success and was published in book form by [[Casterman]] shortly after its conclusion. Herg\u00e9 continued ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'' until {{lang|fr|Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle}}{{'s}} forced closure in 1940, while the series itself became a defining part of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comics tradition]].  In 1947, Herg\u00e9 coloured and redrew ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' in his distinctive {{lang|fr|[[Ligne claire|ligne-claire]]}} style with the aid of [[Edgar P. Jacobs]] for [[Casterman]]'s republication. The story introduces the recurring character [[Bianca Castafiore]], and introduced the fictional countries of Syldavia and [[Borduria]], both of which reappear in later stories. The first volume of the series to be translated into English, ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was adapted for both the 1956 [[Belvision Studios]] animation ''[[Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin]]'' and for the 1991 [[Ellipse Programm\u00e9|Ellipse]]/[[Nelvana]] animated series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nHaving discovered a lost briefcase in a Belgian park, Tintin returns it to its owner, the [[sigillography|sigillographer]] Professor [[Professor Alembick|Hector Alembick]], who informs the reporter of his plans to travel to the [[Balkans|Balkan nation]] of Syldavia. Tintin discovers agents spying on the professor and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=1\u20137}} An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin but is found unconscious and appears to have [[amnesia]]. Shortly after, the reporter receives a threatening note and is then the target of a bomb attack; Tintin survives the latter when police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=7\u201315}} On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the [[sceptre]] of the Medieval King Ottokar IV from the current [[King Muskar XII]] before St. Vladimir's Day, thus forcing him to [[abdication|abdicate]].{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=15\u201322}}\n\nForcibly ejected from the plane by the pilot, Tintin survives and informs local police of his fears regarding the plot. However, the police captain is part of the conspiracy, and he organises an ambush in the woods where Tintin will be eliminated. Tintin evades death, and heads to the capital city of Klow in a car carrying the opera singer [[Bianca Castafiore]].{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=23\u201328}} Leaving the car to evade Castafiore's singing, Tintin is arrested again and survives another assassination attempt before heading to Klow by foot. Arriving in the city, he meets the King's ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', [[Colonel Jorgen|Colonel Boris Jorgen]], and warns him of the plot. However, Jorgen is also a conspirator and organises a further unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Tintin.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=29\u201338}}\n\nTintin succeeds in personally warning the King about the plot. Concerned, Tintin and Muskar rush to Kropow Castle, where the sceptre is kept, to find that the imposter pretending to be Alembick has succeeded in smuggling it out of the building to his accomplices.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=38\u201346}} With the aid of Thomson and Thompson, who have recently arrived in Syldavia, Tintin pursues the thieves, first by car and then by foot. He is able to prevent the sceptre being carried over the border into neighbouring Borduria, discovering a letter on one of the conspirators. It reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by [[M\u00fcsstler]], a political agitator who runs the Syldavian Iron Guard, or Zyldav Zentral Revolutzion\u00e4r Komitz\u00e4t (ZZRK), and who intends to stir up unrest in Syldavia, thereby allowing Borduria to invade and annex the country.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=47\u201353}} Entering Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and heads to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down. Parachuting, he continues to Klow by foot, returning the sceptre to the King on St. Vladimir's Day and securing the monarchy. In thanks, the king makes Tintin a Knight of the Order of the Golden Pelican; the first foreigner to receive the honour. Tintin later learns that the imposter was Alembick's twin brother while police arrest M\u00fcsstler and rescue Professor Alembick.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=54\u201360}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1985-083-10, Anschluss \u00d6sterreich, Wien.jpg|thumb|The ''Anschluss'': cheering crowds greet the Nazis in [[Vienna]]]]\n''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was not the first Tintin adventure to draw specifically on contemporary events; [[Herg\u00e9]] had for instance previously made use of the 1931 [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] as a political backdrop for the setting in ''[[The Blue Lotus]]''.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=61}} This time, Herg\u00e9 had closely observed the unfolding events surrounding the expansionist policies of [[Nazi Germany]].{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=97}} In producing this story, he was particularly influenced by the ''[[Anschluss]]'', the annexation of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] by Nazi Germany in March 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=82|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=81|3a1=Assouline|3y=2009|3p=61|4a1=Peeters|4y=2012|4p=97|5a1=Goddin|5y=2009|5pp=40}} The [[Munich Agreement]] and the subsequent [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland]] followed in October 1938.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=81|2a1=Peeters|2y=2012|2p=97|3a1=Goddin|3y=2009|3pp=40,49}} Three weeks after ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' finished serialisation, Germany invaded Poland.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=81|2a1=Assouline|2y=2009|2p=62|3a1=Goddin|3y=2009|3p=50}} By this point, the threat to Belgian sovereignty posed by Nazi expansionism was becoming increasingly clear.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=97}} By 1939, the events surrounding the [[Italian invasion of Albania|Italian annexation of Albania]] made Herg\u00e9 insist his editor publish the work to take advantage of current events as he felt \"Syldavia is Albania\".{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=62}} Later Herg\u00e9 denied that he had just one country in mind.{{sfn|Assouline|2009|p=62}}\n\nHerg\u00e9 claimed that the basic idea behind the story had been given to him by a friend; biographer [[Beno\u00eet Peeters]] suggested that the most likely candidate was school and [[scouting]] friend Philippe G\u00e9rard, who had warned of a second war with Germany for years.{{sfnm|1a1=Peeters|1y=2012|1p=98|2a1=Goddin|2y=2009|2p=40}} ''Tintin'' scholars have claimed Herg\u00e9 did not develop the names ''Syldavia'' and ''Borduria'' himself;{{efn|At first, Herg\u00e9 named the country \"Sylduria\".{{sfn|Goddin|2009}} }} instead, the country names had supposedly appeared in a paper included in a 1937 edition of the ''[[British Journal of Psychology]]'', in which the author described a hypothetical conflict between a small kingdom and an annexing power.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=82|2a1=Lib\u00e9ration|2y=2006}} Reportedly, the paper, by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] and entitled \"General Foreign Policy\", explored the nature of inter-state conflict in a [[mathematics|mathematical]] way.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=82|2a1=Lib\u00e9ration|2y=2006}} Peeters attributed these claims to Georges Laurenceau, but said that \"no researcher has confirmed this source\". Instead, a paper by Richardson entitled \"Generalized Foreign Politics: A Story in Group Psychology\" was published in ''The British Journal of Psychology Monograph Supplements'' in 1939, but did not mention ''Syldavia'' or ''Borduria''.

For this edition, Herg\u00e9 was assisted by [[Edgar P. Jacobs]], an artist who worked as part of [[Studios Herg\u00e9]]. Jacobs oversaw changes to the costumes and background of the story; in the 1938 version, the Syldavian Royal Guards are dressed like British [[Beefeaters]], while the 1947 version has them dressed in a Balkanised uniform similar to the [[National Guards Unit of Bulgaria]].{{sfnm|1a1=Thompson|1y=1991|1p=84|2a1=Farr|2y=2001|2p=87|3a1=Lofficier|3a2=Lofficier|3y=2002|3p=44}} Jacobs also inserted a cameo of himself and his wife in the Syldavian royal court, while in that same scene is a cameo of Herg\u00e9, his then-wife Germaine, his brother Paul, and three of his friends - \u00c9douard Cnaepelinckx, [[Jacques Van Melkebeke]], and Marcel Stobbaerts.{{sfnm|1a1=Farr|1y=2001|1p=87|2a1=Lofficier|2a2=Lofficier|2y=2002|2p=44}}{{sfn|Tett|2012|p=22}} Herg\u00e9 and Jacobs also inserted further cameos of themselves at the bottom of page 38, where they appear as uniformed officers.{{sfn|Farr|2001|pp=87, 89}} While the character of Professor Alembick had been given the forename of Nestor in the original version, this was changed to Hector for the second; this had been done so as to avoid confusion with the character of [[Nestor (comics)|Nestor]], the butler of [[Marlinspike Hall]], whom Herg\u00e9 had introduced in ''[[The Secret of the Unicorn]]''.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=84}}\nEditions Casterman published this second version in book form in 1947.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=42}}\n\n===Subsequent publications and legacy===\n''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' became the first Tintin adventure to be published for a British audience when ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' serialised the comic in 1951. Here, the names of Tintin and Milou were retained, although the characters of Dupond and Dupont were renamed Thomson and Thompson; the latter two names would be adopted by translators Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner when they translated the series into English for [[Methuen Publishing]] in 1958.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=86}}\n\nCasterman republished the original black-and-white version of the story in 1980, as part of the fourth volume in their {{lang|fr|Archives Herg\u00e9}} collection.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=42}} In 1988, they then published a facsimile version of that first edition.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=42}}\n\n==Critical analysis==\n[[File:Benoit Peeters 20100329 Salon du livre de Paris 3.jpg|thumb|right|Herg\u00e9 biographer [[Beno\u00eet Peeters]] ''(pictured, 2010)'' felt that ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' showed \"a political maturity\".{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=99}}]]\n[[Harry Thompson]] described ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' as a \"biting political satire\" and asserted that it was \"courageous\" of Herg\u00e9 to have written it given that the threat of Nazi invasion was imminent.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=82}} Describing it as a \"classic [[locked room mystery]]\", he praised its \"tightly constructed plot\".{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=83}} Ultimately, he deemed it one of the best three Tintin adventures written before World War II, alongside ''The Blue Lotus'' and ''The Black Island''.{{sfn|Thompson|1991|p=83}} He also thought it noteworthy that in 1976, archaeologists discovered a sceptre belonging to a 13th-century King Ottokar in [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], [[Prague]].{{sfn|Thompson|1991|pp=83\u201384}} Herg\u00e9 biographer [[Pierre Assouline]] believed that the story had the atmosphere of [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]]'s ''[[The Merry Widow]]'', with \"added touches\" from the films of [[Erich von Stroheim]] and [[Ernst Lubitsch]].{{Sfn|Assouline|2009|p=62}} Fellow biographer Beno\u00eet Peeters thought that it exhibited \"a political maturity\" and \"originality\". Further, he felt that Herg\u00e9 was able to break free from the \"narrative limits [of]&nbsp;... too much realism\" by the use of Syldavia as a setting.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=99}}\n\n[[Jean-Marc Lofficier]] and Randy Lofficier called ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' \"a Hitchcockian thriller\" which \"recaptures the paranoid ambience\" of ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=44}} They compared the pace of the latter part of the story to that of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films before noting that despite the \"horrors of the real world\" that are present with Borduria's inclusion, they do not interfere in \"the pure escapist nature of the adventure\". Ultimately they awarded it three stars out of five.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=44}}\n\n[[Michael Farr]] opined that the adventure has \"a convincingly authentic feel\" due to the satirical portrayal to Nazi Germany, but that this was coupled with \"sufficient scope for invention\" with the creation of Syldavia.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=85}} He compared it to Hitchcock's ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]''.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=85}} Farr preferred the colour version assembled with E.P. Jacobs' aid, however. Deeming it \"particularly successful\", he thought that it was \"one of the most polished and accomplished\" adventures in the series, with a \"perfectly paced and balanced\" narrative that mixed drama and comedy successfully.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=89}}\n\nLiterary critic [[Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s]] of [[Stanford University]] asserted that the inclusion of the Iron Guard evoked Colonel [[Fran\u00e7ois de La Rocque]]'s [[Croix-de-Feu]].{{sfn|Apostolid\u00e8s|2010|p=29}} Noting that the figure of M\u00fcsstler was \"the Evil One without a face\", he expressed disbelief regarding Herg\u00e9's depiction of Syldavia, as there were no apparent economic problems or reasons why M\u00fcsstler's anti-monarchist conspiracy was so strong; thus, \"mass revolution remains schematic\".{{sfn|Apostolid\u00e8s|2010|p=29}}\n\nLiterary critic [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]] identified several instances in the story that he argued linked to wider themes within the ''Adventures of Tintin''. He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia,{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=70}} and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=122}} Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy was that of the blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to [[Jesus Christ]] and the Resurrection.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=53}} McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled [[Captain Haddock]], a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, ''The Crab with the Golden Claws''.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=100}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was the first of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' to be adapted for the animated series ''[[Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin]]''. The series was created by Belgium's [[Belvision Studios]] in 1957, directed by Ray Goossens and written by [[Greg (comics)|Greg]]. The studio divided ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' into six 5-minute black-and-white episodes that diverted from Herg\u00e9's original plot in many ways.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=87}} It was also adapted into a 1991 episode of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]'' television series by French studio [[Ellipse]] and Canadian animation company [[Nelvana]].{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=90}} The episode was directed by St\u00e9phane Bernasconi, and Thierry Wermuth voiced the character of Tintin.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=90}}\n\nTintin fans adopted the Syldavian language that appears in the story and used it to construct grammars and dictionaries, akin to the fan following of ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Klingon language|Klingon]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]]'s [[Elvish languages (Middle-earth)|Elvish]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lofficier|1a2=Lofficier|1y=2002|1p=43|2a1=Rogers|2y=2011|2p=215|3a1=Rosenfelder|3y=1996}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Metamorphoses of Tintin, or Tintin for Adults |last=Apostolid\u00e8s |first=Jean-Marie |authorlink=Jean-Marie Apostolid\u00e8s |others=Jocelyn Hoy (translator) |year=2010 |origyear=2006 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |isbn=978-0-8047-6031-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GiktoScv17oC |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Herg\u00e9, the Man Who Created Tintin |last=Assouline |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Assouline |others=Charles Ruas (translator) |year=2009 |origyear=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford and New York |isbn=978-0-19-539759-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YsyEMjvdYJgC |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tintin: The Complete Companion |last=Farr |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Farr |year=2001 |publisher=John Murray |location=London |isbn=978-0-7195-5522-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcytngEACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Art of Herg\u00e9, Inventor of Tintin: Volume 2: 1937-1949 |last=Goddin |first=Philippe |authorlink=Philippe Goddin |others=Michael Farr (translator) |year=2009 |publisher=Last Gasp |location=San Francisco |isbn=978-0-86719-724-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3fenQEACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=King Ottokar's Sceptre |last=Herg\u00e9 |authorlink=Herg\u00e9 |year=1958 |origyear=1947 |others=Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner (translators) |publisher=Egmont |location=London |isbn=978-0-316-35831-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uktet/books?id=hMCengEACAAJ |ref=harv }}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n* {{cite news |title=Une m\u00e9taphore de la Belgique |trans-title=A metaphor of Belgium |language=French |last=Lindon |first=Mathieu |date=21 August 2006 |work=Lib\u00e9ration |location=Paris |url=http://www.liberation.fr/cahier-special/2006/08/21/une-metaphore-de-la-belgique_48910 |url-status=live |accessdate=18 June 2014 |ref={{harvid|Lib\u00e9ration|2006}} }}\n* {{cite book |title=The Pocket Essential Tintin |last1=Lofficier |first1=Jean-Marc |last2=Lofficier |first2=Randy |authorlink1=Jean-Marc Lofficier |year=2002 |publisher=Pocket Essentials |location=Harpenden, Hertfordshire |isbn=978-1-904048-17-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kburngEACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tintin and the Secret of Literature |last=McCarthy |first=Tom |authorlink=Tom McCarthy (novelist) |year=2006 |publisher=Granta |location=London |isbn=978-1-86207-831-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T-UbAQAAIAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Tintin and the World of Herg\u00e9 |last=Peeters |first=Beno\u00eet |authorlink=Beno\u00eet Peeters |year=1989 |publisher=Methuen Children's Books |location=London |isbn=978-0-416-14882-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P97GQgAACAAJ |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |title=Herg\u00e9: Son of Tintin |last=Peeters |first=Beno\u00eet |authorlink=Beno\u00eet Peeters |others=Tina A.

Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper {{lang|fr|[[Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle]]}} for its children's supplement {{lang|fr|[[Le Petit Vingti\u00e8me]]}}, it was serialised weekly from August 1938 to August 1939. Herg\u00e9 intended the story as a satirical criticism of the expansionist policies of [[Nazi Germany]], in particular the [[annexation]] of [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] in March 1938 (the ''[[Anschluss]]''). The story tells of young Belgian reporter [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]] and his dog [[Snowy (character)|Snowy]], who travel to the fictional Balkan nation of [[Syldavia]], where they combat a plot to overthrow the monarchy of [[King Muskar XII]].\n\n''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was a commercial success and was published in book form by [[Casterman]] shortly after its conclusion. Herg\u00e9 continued ''The Adventures of Tintin'' with ''[[Land of Black Gold]]'' until {{lang|fr|Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle}}{{'s}} forced closure in 1940, while the series itself became a defining part of the [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comics tradition]].  In 1947, Herg\u00e9 coloured and redrew ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' in his distinctive {{lang|fr|[[Ligne claire|ligne-claire]]}} style with the aid of [[Edgar P. Jacobs]] for [[Casterman]]'s republication. The story introduces the recurring character [[Bianca Castafiore]], and introduced the fictional countries of Syldavia and [[Borduria]], both of which reappear in later stories. The first volume of the series to be translated into English, ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was adapted for both the 1956 [[Belvision Studios]] animation ''[[Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin]]'' and for the 1991 [[Ellipse Programm\u00e9|Ellipse]]/[[Nelvana]] animated series ''[[The Adventures of Tintin (TV series)|The Adventures of Tintin]]''.\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nHaving discovered a lost briefcase in a Belgian park, Tintin returns it to its owner, the [[sigillography|sigillographer]] Professor [[Professor Alembick|Hector Alembick]], who informs the reporter of his plans to travel to the [[Balkans|Balkan nation]] of Syldavia. Tintin discovers agents spying on the professor and follows those responsible to a nearby Syldavian restaurant.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=1\u20137}} An unknown man agrees to meet with Tintin but is found unconscious and appears to have [[amnesia]]. Shortly after, the reporter receives a threatening note and is then the target of a bomb attack; Tintin survives the latter when police detectives [[Thomson and Thompson]] intercept the bomb. Suspecting that these events are linked to Syldavia, Tintin decides to accompany Professor Alembick on his forthcoming visit to the country.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=7\u201315}} On the plane journey there, Tintin notices Alembick acting out of character, and suspects that an imposter has replaced him. Reading a brochure on Syldavian history, Tintin theorises that the imposter is part of a plot to steal the [[sceptre]] of the Medieval King Ottokar IV from the current [[King Muskar XII]] before St. Vladimir's Day, thus forcing him to [[abdication|abdicate]].{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=15\u201322}}\n\nForcibly ejected from the plane by the pilot, Tintin survives and informs local police of his fears regarding the plot. However, the police captain is part of the conspiracy, and he organises an ambush in the woods where Tintin will be eliminated. Tintin evades death, and heads to the capital city of Klow in a car carrying the opera singer [[Bianca Castafiore]].{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=23\u201328}} Leaving the car to evade Castafiore's singing, Tintin is arrested again and survives another assassination attempt before heading to Klow by foot. Arriving in the city, he meets the King's ''[[aide-de-camp]]'', [[Colonel Jorgen|Colonel Boris Jorgen]], and warns him of the plot. However, Jorgen is also a conspirator and organises a further unsuccessful assassination attempt aimed at Tintin.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=29\u201338}}\n\nTintin succeeds in personally warning the King about the plot. Concerned, Tintin and Muskar rush to Kropow Castle, where the sceptre is kept, to find that the imposter pretending to be Alembick has succeeded in smuggling it out of the building to his accomplices.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=38\u201346}} With the aid of Thomson and Thompson, who have recently arrived in Syldavia, Tintin pursues the thieves, first by car and then by foot. He is able to prevent the sceptre being carried over the border into neighbouring Borduria, discovering a letter on one of the conspirators. It reveals that the plot has been orchestrated by [[M\u00fcsstler]], a political agitator who runs the Syldavian Iron Guard, or Zyldav Zentral Revolutzion\u00e4r Komitz\u00e4t (ZZRK), and who intends to stir up unrest in Syldavia, thereby allowing Borduria to invade and annex the country.{{sfn|Herg\u00e9|1947|pp=47\u201353}} Entering Borduria, Tintin commandeers a fighter plane and heads to Klow, but the Syldavian military shoot him down.

Further, he felt that Herg\u00e9 was able to break free from the \"narrative limits [of]&nbsp;... too much realism\" by the use of Syldavia as a setting.{{sfn|Peeters|2012|p=99}}\n\n[[Jean-Marc Lofficier]] and Randy Lofficier called ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' \"a Hitchcockian thriller\" which \"recaptures the paranoid ambience\" of ''[[Cigars of the Pharaoh]]''.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=44}} They compared the pace of the latter part of the story to that of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films before noting that despite the \"horrors of the real world\" that are present with Borduria's inclusion, they do not interfere in \"the pure escapist nature of the adventure\". Ultimately they awarded it three stars out of five.{{sfn|Lofficier|Lofficier|2002|p=44}}\n\n[[Michael Farr]] opined that the adventure has \"a convincingly authentic feel\" due to the satirical portrayal to Nazi Germany, but that this was coupled with \"sufficient scope for invention\" with the creation of Syldavia.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=85}} He compared it to Hitchcock's ''[[The Lady Vanishes (1938 film)|The Lady Vanishes]]''.{{sfn|Farr|2001|p=85}} Farr preferred the colour version assembled with E.P.

He identified a recurring host-and-guest theme in Alembick's visit to Syldavia,{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=70}} and believed that the theme of thieving was present in the story as Alembick's identity is stolen.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=122}} Another theme identified within the series by McCarthy was that of the blurring between the sacred and the political; he saw echoes of this in ''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' as the King has to wait three days before appearing to the Syldavian public on St. Vladimir's Day, something that McCarthy thought linked to [[Jesus Christ]] and the Resurrection.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=53}} McCarthy also opined that a number of characters in the book visually resembled [[Captain Haddock]], a character who would be introduced in the subsequent Tintin adventure, ''The Crab with the Golden Claws''.{{sfn|McCarthy|2006|p=100}}\n\n==Adaptations==\n''King Ottokar's Sceptre'' was the first of ''The Adventures of Tintin'' to be adapted for the animated series ''[[Herg\u00e9's Adventures of Tintin]]''.

The [[Gospel of John]] also depicts Peter fishing, even after the resurrection of Jesus, in the story of the [[Miraculous Draught of Fish|Catch of 153 fish]].

Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. Matthew additionally describes Peter walking on water for a moment but beginning to sink when his faith wavers ([[Matthew 14]]:28\u201331).\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Last Supper]], Jesus washed his disciples' feet. Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10). Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it ([[Luke 22]]:49\u201351). This healing of the servant's ear is the last of the [[Miracles of Jesus|37 miracles attributed to Jesus]] in the Bible.\n\nSimon Peter was twice arraigned, with John, before the [[Sanhedrin]] and directly defied them ([[Acts 4]]:7\u201322, [[Acts 5]]:18\u201342). After receiving a vision from [[God]] that allowed for the eating of previously unclean animals, Peter takes a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] ([[Acts 9]]:32\u2013[[Acts 10]]:2), becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s ([[Acts 10]]).

Peter/Cephas is mentioned briefly in the opening chapter of one of the [[Pauline epistles]], [[Epistle to the Galatians]], which mentions a trip by [[Paul the Apostle]] to [[Jerusalem]] where he meets Peter ([[Galatians 1]]:18). Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with [[Barnabas]] and [[Saint Titus|Titus]]) returned to Jerusalem ([[Galatians 2]]:7-9).

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a reminiscent<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

After seeing the graveclothes he goes home, apparently without informing the other disciples.{{Bibleref2c|Lk.|24:1\u201312}}\n\nIn the [[John 21|final chapter]] of the Gospel of John, Peter, in one of the resurrection appearances of Jesus, [[Restoration of Peter|three times affirmed his love for Jesus]], balancing his threefold denial, and Jesus reconfirmed Peter's position. The Church of the Primacy of St. Peter on the [[Sea of Galilee]] is seen as the traditional site where Jesus Christ appeared to his disciples after his resurrection and, according to Catholic tradition, established Peter's supreme jurisdiction over the Christian church.\n\n===Leader of the early church===\n[[File:Liberation of Saint Peter by Giovanni Lanfranco-BMA.jpg|thumb|left|''The Liberation of St. Peter'' from prison by an angel, by [[Giovanni Lanfranco]], 1620\u201321]]\n\nPeter was considered along with James the Just and John the Apostle as pillars of the Church.<ref>Galatians 2:9</ref> Legitimised by Jesus' appearance, Peter assumed leadership of the group of early followers, forming the Jerusalem ''ekkl\u0113sia'' mentioned by Paul.{{sfn|Pagels|2005|p=45}}{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|p=116}} He was soon eclipsed in this leadership by James the Just, \"the Brother of the Lord.\"{{sfn|Pagels|2005|pp=45\u201346}}{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|pp=116\u2013117}} According to L\u00fcdemann, this was due to the discussions about the [[Paul and Judaism|strictness of adherence]] to the Jewish Law, when the more conservative faction of James the Just<ref>{{cite journal |title=James the Just in History and Tradition: Perspectives of Past and Present Scholarship (Part I) |journal=Currents in Research |volume=5 |pages=73\u2013122 |last=Myllykoski |first=Matti |publisher=Helsinki Collegium for Advanced Studies, Finland |quote=James the Just, the brother of Jesus, is known from the New Testament as the chief apostle of the Torah-obedient Christians.|doi=10.1177/1476993X06068700 |year=2006 }}</ref> took the overhand over the more liberal position of Peter, who soon lost influence.{{sfn|L\u00fcdemann|\u00d6zen|1996|pp=116\u2013117}}{{refn|group=note|At the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (c. 50), the early Church, Paul and the leaders of the Jerusalem church met and decided to embrace Gentile converts.

Harrington]], who suggests that Peter was an unlikely symbol of stability. While he was one of the first disciples called and was the spokesman for the group, Peter is also the exemplar of \"little faith\". In {{Bibleref2|Matthew|14}}, Peter will soon have Jesus say to him, \"O you of little faith, why did you doubt?\", and he will eventually deny Jesus three times.

This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was \"as usual\" accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]].

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]].\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref> Cullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=\"Time\" />\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or \"this same\", when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of \"Rock\" by looking at the Aramaic language. While the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual, which is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the rock until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (To the Romans, Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations\".\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. In the Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. In a ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination etcetera, reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], who believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language. The textual features of these two epistles are such that a majority of scholars doubt that they were written by the same hand. Some scholars argue that theological differences imply different sources, and point to the lack of references to 2&nbsp;Peter among the early Church Fathers.\n\n[[Daniel B. Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient... Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline''].

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150, there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250. \n<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\". ''(De Viris Illustribus 1)''<ref>{{cite web|last1=saint|first1=Jerome|title=De Viris Illustribus (On Illustrious Men) Chapter 1|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2708.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=9 June 2015}}</ref> But he himself received the epistle, and explained the difference in style and character and structure of words by the assumption that Peter used different interpreters in the composition of the two epistles;<ref name=\"Jerome\" /> and from his time onward the epistle was generally regarded as a part of the New Testament.\n\nEven in early times there was controversy over its authorship, and Second Peter was often not included in the [[biblical canon]]; it was only in the 4th century that it gained a firm foothold in the New Testament, in a series of synods. In the east the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n====Mark====\nTraditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark#Authorship and sources|Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter, hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to Eusebius' ''|Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements<ref>Eusebius,'' Ecclesiastical History'', 3.39.14\u201316</ref>}}\n\nClement of Alexandria in the fragments of his work ''Hypotyposes (A.D. 190)'' preserved and cited by the historian Eusebius in his Church History (VI, 14: 6) writes that:\n\n{{quote|As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.<ref name=\"CL\" />}}\n\nAlso Irenaeus wrote about this tradition:\n\n{{quote|After their (Peter and Paul's) passing, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, transmitted to us in writing the things preached by Peter.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III. 1.2.; quoted by Eusebius in ''Ecclesiastical History'', book 5, 7.6</ref>}}\n\nBased on these quotes, and on the Christian tradition, the information in Mark's gospel about Peter would be based on eyewitness material.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> The gospel itself is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]], and the above passages are the oldest surviving written testimony to its authorship.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n===Pseudepigrapha and apocrypha===\n[[File:Muenster-100725-15996-\u00dcberwasserkirche-Schl\u00fcssel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The [[Key (lock)|key]] as symbol of St. Peter]]\nThere are also a number of other [[apocrypha]]l writings, that have been either attributed to or written about Peter.

The account is similar to that of the canonical gospels, especially the [[Gospel of Mark]]. It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.<ref>''Das Evangelium nach Petrus.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Repentance.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

Some Protestants, however, have rejected Peter's martyrdom as a later invention, arguing that evidence of Peter exists only in biblical accounts and not in the [[history]].\n\nIt has also been suggested that there was a serious division between Peter's [[Jewish Christian]] party and Paul's Hellenizing party, seen in e.g. the [[Incident at Antioch]], which later Christian accounts have downplayed.<ref>White, L.

The [[Gospel of John]] also depicts Peter fishing, even after the resurrection of Jesus, in the story of the [[Miraculous Draught of Fish|Catch of 153 fish]]. In Matthew and Mark, Jesus called Simon and his brother Andrew to be \"[[fishers of men]]\" ([[Matthew 4:18]]\u2013[[Matthew 4:19|19]], [[Mark 1]]:16\u201317).\n\nA Franciscan church is built upon the traditional site of Apostle Peter's house.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2000/3/Capernaum-%20The%20Church%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Peter|title=|publisher=}}</ref>\nIn [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Simon Peter owns the boat that Jesus uses to preach to the multitudes who were pressing on him at the shore of [[Sea of Galilee|Lake Gennesaret]] ([[Luke 5]]:3). Jesus then amazes Simon and his companions James and John (Andrew is not mentioned) by telling them to lower their nets, whereupon they catch a huge number of fish. Immediately after this, they follow him ([[Luke 5]]:4\u201311). The [[Gospel of John]] gives a comparable account of \"The First Disciples\" ([[John 1]]:35\u201342). In John, the readers are told that it was two disciples of [[John the Baptist]] (Andrew and an unnamed disciple) who heard John the Baptist announce Jesus as the \"[[Lamb of God]]\" and then followed Jesus. Andrew then went to his brother Simon, saying, \"We have found the [[Messiah]]\", and then brought Simon to Jesus.\n\n[[File:Cavalier d'Arpino - Christ Taken Prisoner - WGA04690.jpg|thumb|right|Apostle Peter striking the [[High Priest]]s' servant [[Malchus]] with a sword in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], by [[Giuseppe Cesari]] c. 1597]]\n\nThree of the four gospels\u2014Matthew, Mark and John\u2014recount the story of Jesus [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]]. Matthew additionally describes Peter walking on water for a moment but beginning to sink when his faith wavers ([[Matthew 14]]:28\u201331).\n\nAt the beginning of the [[Last Supper]], Jesus washed his disciples' feet. Peter initially refused to let Jesus wash his feet, but when Jesus threatened him with: \"If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me\", Peter replied: \"Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head\" ([[John 13]]:2\u201311). The [[foot washing|washing of feet]] is often repeated in the [[service of worship]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] by some [[Christian denominations]].\n\nThe three [[Synoptic Gospels]] all mention that, when Jesus was arrested, one of his companions cut off the ear of a servant of the [[High Priest of Israel]] ([[Matthew 26]]:51, [[Mark 14]]:47, [[Luke 22]]:50). The Gospel of John also includes this event and names Peter as the swordsman and [[Malchus]] as the victim ([[John 18]]:10). Luke adds that Jesus touched the ear and miraculously healed it ([[Luke 22]]:49\u201351). This healing of the servant's ear is the last of the [[Miracles of Jesus|37 miracles attributed to Jesus]] in the Bible.\n\nSimon Peter was twice arraigned, with John, before the [[Sanhedrin]] and directly defied them ([[Acts 4]]:7\u201322, [[Acts 5]]:18\u201342). After receiving a vision from [[God]] that allowed for the eating of previously unclean animals, Peter takes a missionary journey to [[Lod|Lydda]], [[Jaffa, Israel|Joppa]] and [[Caesarea Maritima|Caesarea]] ([[Acts 9]]:32\u2013[[Acts 10]]:2), becoming instrumental in the decision to evangelise the [[Gentile]]s ([[Acts 10]]). Simon Peter applied the message of the vision on clean animals to the gentiles and follows his meeting with [[Cornelius the Centurion]] by claiming that \"God shows no partiality ([[Acts 10]]).\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+10&version=NRSV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Acts 10 \u2013 New Revised Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], Peter and John were sent from Jerusalem to [[Samaria]] ([[Acts 8]]:14). Peter/Cephas is mentioned briefly in the opening chapter of one of the [[Pauline epistles]], [[Epistle to the Galatians]], which mentions a trip by [[Paul the Apostle]] to [[Jerusalem]] where he meets Peter ([[Galatians 1]]:18). Peter features again in Galatians, fourteen years later, when Paul (now with [[Barnabas]] and [[Saint Titus|Titus]]) returned to Jerusalem ([[Galatians 2]]:7-9). When Peter came to [[Antioch]], Paul opposed Peter to his face \"because he [Peter] was in the wrong\" ([[Galatians 2]]:11).<ref>see [[Incident at Antioch]]; see also the section below headed \"Road to Rome: Antioch and Corinth\"</ref>\n[[File:Apostle_Peter_Released_from_Prison,_Jacopo_di_Cione,_1370-1371_(Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art).jpg|left|thumb|''Apostle Peter Released from Prison'', [[Jacopo di Cione]], 1370-1371 ([[Philadelphia Museum of Art]])]]\n[[Acts 12]] narrates how Peter, who was in Jerusalem, was put into prison by [[Agrippa I]] (A.D. 42\u201344), but was [[liberation of Saint Peter|rescued by an angel]].

The three Synoptics and John describe the three denials as follows:\n# A denial when a female servant of the high priest spots Simon Peter, saying that he had been with Jesus. According to Mark (but not in all manuscripts), \"the rooster crowed\". Only Luke and John mention a fire by which Peter was warming himself among other people: according to Luke, Peter was \"sitting\"; according to John, he was \"standing\".\n# A denial when Simon Peter had gone out to the gateway, away from the firelight, but the same servant girl (Mark) or another servant girl (Matthew) or a man (Luke and also John, for whom, though, this is the third denial) told the bystanders he was a follower of Jesus. According to John, \"the rooster crowed\". The Gospel of John places the second denial while Peter was still warming himself at the fire, and gives as the occasion of the third denial a claim by someone to have seen him in the garden of [[Gethsemane]] when [[arrest of Jesus|Jesus was arrested]].\n# A denial came when Peter's Galilean accent was taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, \"the rooster crowed\". Matthew adds that it was his [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke deviates slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.\n\nIn the Gospel of Luke is a record of Christ telling Peter: \"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.\" In a reminiscent<ref name=\"May Metzger\">May, Herbert G. and Bruce M.

This took place three months after the disastrous fire that destroyed Rome for which the emperor (Nero) wished to blame the Christians. This \"dies imperii\" (regnal day anniversary) was an important one, exactly ten years after Nero ascended to the throne, and it was \"as usual\" accompanied by much bloodshed. Traditionally, [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities sentenced him to death by [[crucifixion]]. In accordance with the [[apocryphal]] [[Acts of Peter]], he was crucified head down.<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html Apocryphal ''Acts of Peter Chapter 37''].</ref> Tradition also locates his burial place where the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Basilica of Saint Peter]] was later built, directly beneath the Basilica's high altar.\n\n[[File:Crucifixion of Saint Peter-Caravaggio (c.1600).jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Crucifixion of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]'' (1601) by [[Caravaggio]]]]\n\n[[Pope Clement I]] (d.99), in his ''Letter to the Corinthians'' (Chapter 5), written c. 80\u201398, speaks of Peter's martyrdom in the following terms: \"Let us take the noble examples of our own generation.

([[Vercelli manuscript|Vercelli]] Acts XXXV<ref>[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/actspeter.html The Acts of Peter], by M. R.

According to the story, Peter, fleeing Rome to avoid execution meets the risen Jesus. In the Latin translation, Peter asks Jesus, \"Quo vadis?\" He replies, \"''Romam eo iterum crucifigi\"'' (\"I am going to Rome to be crucified again\"). Peter then gains the courage to continue his ministry and returns to the city, where he is martyred. This story is commemorated in an [[Annibale Carracci]] painting. The [[Quo Vadis (church)|Church of Quo Vadis]], near the [[Catacombs]] of [[Pope Callistus I|Saint Callistus]], contains a stone in which Jesus' footprints from this event are supposedly preserved, though this was apparently an ''[[ex-voto]]'' from a [[pilgrim]], and indeed a copy of the original housed in the [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura|Basilica of St Sebastian]].\n\nThe death of Peter is attested to by [[Tertullian]] (c. 155\u2013c. 240) at the end of the 2nd century in his ''Prescription Against Heretics'', noting that Peter endured a passion like his Lord's.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Quintus Septimius Florens|first1=Tertullian|title=Prescription Against Heretics Chapter XXXVI|url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.v.iii.xxxvi.html|publisher=ccel.org|accessdate=1 June 2015}} \"Since, moreover, you are close upon Italy, you have Rome, from which there comes even into our own hands the very authority (of apostles themselves).

[[Augustine of Hippo]] says in his Sermon 295: \"One day is assigned for the celebration of the martyrdom of the two apostles. But those two were one. Although their martyrdom occurred on different days, they were one.\"\n\nThis is also the feast of both [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] in the calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nIn the [[Roman Rite]], the feast of the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] is celebrated on 22 February, and the anniversary of the dedication of the two [[Papal Basilica|papal basilicas]] of [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] is held on 18 November.\n\nBefore [[Pope John XXIII]]'s revision in 1960, the Roman Calendar also included on 18 January another feast of the Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Saint Peter in Chains]].\n\nIn the Orthodox [[Daily Office]] every Thursday throughout the year is dedicated to the Holy Apostles, including St. Peter. There are also two [[feast day]]s in the year which are dedicated to him:\n\n* June 29, [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]]\u2014This is a major feast day and is preceded by a period of Lenten fasting known as the [[Apostles' Fast]].\n* January 16, [[Liberation of Saint Peter|Veneration of the Precious Chains of the Holy and All-Glorious Apostle Peter]]\u2014commemorating both the chains which {{Bibleref2|Acts|12:1\u201311}} says miraculously fell from him, and the chains in which he was held before his [[martyr]]dom by [[Nero]].\n\n==Primacy of Peter==\nChristians of different theological backgrounds are in disagreement as to the exact significance of Peter's ministry. For instance: \n* Catholics view Peter as the first pope. The Catholic Church asserts that Peter's ministry, conferred upon him by Jesus of Nazareth in the gospels, lays down the theological foundation for the pope's exercise of pastoral authority over the Church.\n* Eastern Orthodox also believe that Peter's ministry points to an underlying theology wherein a special primacy ought to be granted to Peter's successors above other Church leaders but see this as merely a \"primacy of honor\", rather than the right to exercise pastoral authority.\n* Protestant denominations assert that Peter's apostolic work in Rome does not imply a connection between him and the papacy.\nSimilarly, historians of various backgrounds also offer differing interpretations of the Apostle's presence in Rome.\n\n===Catholic Church===\n{{Main|Primacy of Simon Peter|Papal primacy}}\n[[File:Statua di San Pietro realizzata da Giuseppe De Fabris - Piazza di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of St. Peter in [[St. Peter's Square]] at the Vatican]]\n\nAccording to Catholic belief, Simon Peter was distinguished by Jesus to hold the [[Primacy of Simon Peter|first place of honor and authority]]. Also in Catholic belief, Peter was, as the first Bishop of Rome, the first [[Pope]]. Furthermore, they consider every Pope to be Peter's successor and the rightful superior of all other [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]].<ref name=CEPope>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Pope|author=Joyce, G.

He believes the meaning of the original Aramaic is very clear: that \"Kepha\" was the Aramaic word for \"rock\", and that it was also the name by which Christ called Peter.<ref name=Time/>\n\nYet, Cullmann sharply rejects the Catholic claim that Peter began the papal succession. He writes: \"In the life of Peter there is no starting point for a chain of succession to the leadership of the church at large.\" While he believes the Matthew text is entirely valid and is in no way spurious, he says it cannot be used as \"warrant of the papal succession.\"<ref name=Time>{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,890753-1,00.html |title=Religion: Peter & the Rock |publisher=Time |date=1953-12-07 |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\nCullmann concludes that while Peter ''was'' the original head of the apostles, Peter was not the founder of any visible church succession.<ref name=Time/>\n\nThere are other Protestant scholars who also partially defend the historical Catholic position about \"Rock.\"<ref>D. A. Carson in ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1984).</ref> Taking a somewhat different approach from Cullman, they point out that the Gospel of Matthew was not written in the classical Attic form of Greek, but in the Hellenistic [[Koine Greek|Koine dialect]] in which there is no distinction in meaning between ''petros'' and ''petra''. Moreover, even in Attic Greek, in which the regular meaning of ''petros'' was a smallish \"stone,\" there are instances of its use to refer to larger rocks, as in [[Sophocles]], ''[[Oedipus at Colonus]]'' v. 1595, where ''petros'' refers to a boulder used as a landmark, obviously something more than a pebble. In any case, a ''petros''/''petra'' distinction is irrelevant considering the Aramaic language in which the phrase might well have been spoken. In Greek, of any period, the feminine noun ''petra'' could not be used as the given name of a male, which may explain the use of ''Petros'' as the Greek word with which to translate Aramaic ''Kepha''.<ref name=\"keating\" />\n\nYet, still other Protestant scholars believe that Jesus in fact ''did'' mean to single out Peter as the very rock which he will build upon, but that the passage does nothing to indicate a continued succession of Peter's implied position. They assert that Matthew uses the demonstrative pronoun ''taute'', which allegedly means \"this very\" or ''this same'', when he refers to the rock on which Jesus' church will be built. He also uses the Greek word for \"and\", ''kai''. It is alleged that when a demonstrative pronoun is used with ''kai'', the pronoun refers back to the preceding noun. The second rock Jesus refers to must then be the same rock as the first one; and if Peter is the first rock he must also be the second.<ref>''Jesus, Peter & the Keys: A Scriptural Handbook on the Papacy''</ref>\n\nUnlike Oscar Cullmann, [[Confessional Lutherans]] and many other Protestant apologists agree that it's meaningless to elaborate the meaning of ''Rock'' by looking at the Aramaic language, this is true that the Jews spoke mostly Aramaic at home, however in public they usually spoke Greek. The few Aramaic words spoken by Jesus in public were unusual and that is why they are noted as such. And most importantly the New Testament was revealed in Koine Greek, ''not'' Aramaic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203191915/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/GawrischDoctrine.pdf|url-status=dead|title=''The Doctrine of Church and Ministry in the Life of the Church Today''|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203192344/http://www.wlsessays.net/files/BalgeMinistry.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Cross-Cultural And Multicultural Ministry In the New Testament|archive-date=3 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.graceway.com/articles/article_017.html|title=Some Thoughts on Matthew 16:18|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nLutheran historians even report that the Catholic church itself didn't, at least unanimously, regard Peter as the ''Rock'' until the 1870s:\n{{quote|Rome's rule for explaining the Scriptures and determining doctrine is the [[Profession of faith (Catholic Church)#Tridentine Creed|Creed]] of [[Pius IV]].

Another title used for Peter is ''Coryphaeus'', which could be translated as \"Choir-director\", or lead singer.<ref>[[John Meyendorff]], et al. (1963), ''The Primacy of Peter in the Orthodox Church'' ([[St. Vladimir's Seminary]] Press, Crestwood NY, {{ISBN|978-0-88141-125-6}})</ref> The church recognizes Apostle Peter's leadership role in the [[early church]], especially in the very early days at Jerusalem, but does not consider him to have had any \"princely\" role over his fellow Apostles.\n\nThe New Testament is not seen by the Orthodox as supporting any extraordinary authority for Peter with regard to faith or morals. The Orthodox also hold that Peter did not act as leader at the [[Council of Jerusalem]], but as merely one of a number who spoke. The final decision regarding the non-necessity of [[circumcision]] (and certain prohibitions) was spelled out by [[James, the Brother of the Lord]] (though Catholics hold James merely reiterated and fleshed out what Peter had said, regarding the latter's earlier divine revelation regarding the inclusion of Gentiles).\n\nEastern and Oriental Orthodox do not recognize the Bishop of Rome as the successor of St. Peter but the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] sends a delegation each year to Rome to participate in the celebration of the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul. In the [[declaration of Ravenna|Ravenna Document]] of 13 October 2007, the representatives of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] agreed that \"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St. Ignatius of Antioch (To the Romans, Prologue), occupied the first place in the ''taxis'', and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the ''protos'' among the patriarchs, if the Papacy unites with the Orthodox Church. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as ''protos'', a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium.\"\n\nWith regard to Jesus' words to Peter, \"Thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church\", the Orthodox hold Christ is referring to the confession of faith, ''not'' the person of Peter as that upon which he will build the church. This is allegedly shown by the fact that the original Greek uses the feminine demonstrative pronoun when he says \"upon this rock\" (\u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3 \u03c4\u1fc7 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c4\u03c1\u1fb3); whereas, grammatically, if he had been referring to Peter, he would allegedly have used the masculine.<ref>Holy Apostles Convent (1999) ''The Orthodox New Testament'', Vol. I: The Holy Gospels (Dormition Skete, Buena Vista CO, {{ISBN|0-944359-13-2}}) p. 105</ref> This \"gender distinction\" argument is also held by some Protestants.\n\n===Syriac Orthodox Church===\n[[File:Antonio de Bellis - La liberazione di San Pietro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''Saint Peter and the angel'', by [[Antonio de Bellis]] ]] \nThe Fathers of the Syriac Orthodox Church tried to give a theological interpretation to the primacy of Apostle Peter. They were fully convinced of the unique office of Peter in the primitive Christian community. [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]], [[Aphrahat]] and [[Maruthas]] who were supposed to have been the best exponents of the early [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac tradition]] unequivocally acknowledge the office of Peter.\n\nThe Syriac Fathers, following the rabbinic tradition, call Jesus \"Kepha\" for they see \"rock\" in the Old Testament as a messianic Symbol (yet the Old Maronite Syriacs of Lebanon still refer to Saint Peter as \"Saint Simon the Generous\" or Simon Karam\"). When Christ gave his own name \"Kepha\" to Simon he was giving him participation in the person and office of Christ. Christ who is the Kepha and shepherd made Simon the chief shepherd in his place and gave him the very name Kepha and said that on Kepha he would build the Church. [[Aphrahat]] shared the common Syriac tradition. For him Kepha is in fact another name of Jesus, and Simon was given the right to share the name. The person who receives somebody else's name also obtains the rights of the person who bestows the name. Aphrahat makes the stone taken from Jordan a type of Peter. He wrote: \"Jesus son of Nun set up the stones for a witness in Israel; Jesus our Saviour called Simon Kepha Sarirto and set him as the faithful witness among nations\".\n\nAgain he wrote in his commentary on [[Deuteronomy]] that [[Moses]] brought forth water from \"rock\" (Kepha) for the people and Jesus sent Simon Kepha to carry his teachings among nations. God accepted him and made him the foundation of the Church and called him Kepha. When he speaks about the transfiguration of Christ he calls him [[Simon Peter]], the foundation of the Church. Ephrem also shared the same view. In the Armenian version of [[De Virginitate]] records that [[Peter the rock]] shunned honour. In a ''mimro'' of Efrem found in Holy Week Liturgy points to the importance of Peter.\n\nBoth [[Aphrahat]] and [[Ephrem the Syrian|Ephrem]] represent the authentic tradition of the Syrian Church. The different orders of liturgies used for sanctification of Church buildings, marriage, ordination etcetera, reveal that the primacy of Peter is a part of living faith of the Church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syrianchurch.org/Articles/PrimacyofStPeter.htm |title=\"Primacy of St. Peter\" \u2013 by Dr. Thomas Athanasius |publisher=Syrianchurch.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12}}</ref>\n\n===New Apostolic Church===\nThe [[New Apostolic Church]], who believes in the re-established Apostle ministry, sees Peter as the first [[Chief Apostle]].\n\n===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===\n[[File:Saint Peter by Gr\u00e3o Vasco.jpg|thumb|''Saint Peter'' by [[Gr\u00e3o Vasco|Vasco Fernandes]], 1506]]\n\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] teaches that Peter was the first leader of the early Christian church after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.

Both demonstrate a high quality of cultured and urban Greek, at odds with the linguistic skill that would ordinarily be expected of an [[Aramaic]]-speaking fisherman, who would have learned Greek as a second or third language.

Wallace]] (who maintains that Peter was the author) writes that, for many scholars, \"the issue of authorship is already settled, at least negatively: the apostle Peter did not write this letter\" and that \"the vast bulk of NT scholars adopts this perspective without much discussion\". However, he later states, \"Although a very strong case has been made against Petrine authorship of 2 Peter, we believe it is deficient... Taken together, these external and internal arguments strongly suggest the traditional view, viz., that Peter was indeed the author of the second epistle which bears his name.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20031209164253/http://www.bible.org/docs/soapbox/2petotl.htm ''Second Peter: Introduction, Argument, and Outline''].

The Roman historian [[Tacitus]] and the biographer [[Suetonius]] do both record that Nero persecuted Christians, and Tacitus dates this to immediately after the fire that burned Rome in 64. Christian tradition, for example Eusebius of Caesarea (''History'' book 2, 24.1), has maintained that Peter was killed in Nero's persecution, and thus had to assume that the Roman persecution alluded to in First Peter must be this Neronian persecution.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> On the other hand, many modern scholars argue that First Peter refers to the persecution of Christians in Asia Minor during the reign of the emperor [[Domitian]] (81\u201396), as the letter is explicitly addressed to Jewish Christians from that region:\n\n{{quote|Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to God's elect, strangers in the world, scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance.{{Bibleref2c|1Pet|1:1\u20132}}}}\n\nThose scholars who believe that the epistle dates from the time of Domitian argue that Nero's persecution of Christians was confined to the city of Rome itself, and did not extend to the Asian provinces mentioned in 1 Pet 1:1\u20132.\n \nThe [[Second Epistle of Peter]], on the other hand, appears to have been copied, in part, from the [[Epistle of Jude]], and some modern scholars date its composition as late as ''c.'' 150. Some scholars argue the opposite, that the Epistle of Jude copied Second Peter, while others contend an early date for Jude and thus observe that an early date is not incompatible with the text.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> Many scholars have noted the similarities between the [[apocrypha]]l [[Second Epistle of Clement]] (2nd century) and Second Peter. Second Peter may be earlier than 150, there are a few possible references to it that date back to the 1st century or early 2nd century, e.g., [[1 Clement]] written in ''c.'' AD 96, and the later church historian Eusebius wrote that [[Origen]] had made reference to the epistle before 250. \n<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Eusebius|title=Church History Book VI, Chapter 25|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nJerome says that Peter \"wrote two epistles which are called Catholic, the second of which, on account of its difference from the first in style, is considered by many not to be by him\".

In the east the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] still did not admit it into the canon until the 6th century.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n====Mark====\nTraditionally, the [[Gospel of Mark#Authorship and sources|Gospel of Mark]] was said to have been written by a person named [[John Mark]], and that this person was an assistant to Peter, hence its content was traditionally seen as the closest to Peter's viewpoint. According to Eusebius' ''|Ecclesiastical History'', [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]] recorded this belief from [[John the Presbyter]]:\n\n{{quote|Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a normal or chronological narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictional into the statements<ref>Eusebius,'' Ecclesiastical History'', 3.39.14\u201316</ref>}}\n\nClement of Alexandria in the fragments of his work ''Hypotyposes (A.D. 190)'' preserved and cited by the historian Eusebius in his Church History (VI, 14: 6) writes that:\n\n{{quote|As Peter had preached the Word publicly at Rome, and declared the Gospel by the Spirit, many who were present requested that [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], who had followed him for a long time and remembered his sayings, should write them out. And having composed the Gospel he gave it to those who had requested it.<ref name=\"CL\" />}}\n\nAlso Irenaeus wrote about this tradition:\n\n{{quote|After their (Peter and Paul's) passing, Mark also, the disciple and interpreter of Peter, transmitted to us in writing the things preached by Peter.<ref>Irenaeus, ''Against Heresies'', III. 1.2.; quoted by Eusebius in ''Ecclesiastical History'', book 5, 7.6</ref>}}\n\nBased on these quotes, and on the Christian tradition, the information in Mark's gospel about Peter would be based on eyewitness material.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/> The gospel itself is [[Anonymous work|anonymous]], and the above passages are the oldest surviving written testimony to its authorship.<ref name=\"ce-epistles\"/>\n\n===Pseudepigrapha and apocrypha===\n[[File:Muenster-100725-15996-\u00dcberwasserkirche-Schl\u00fcssel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|The [[Key (lock)|key]] as symbol of St. Peter]]\nThere are also a number of other [[apocrypha]]l writings, that have been either attributed to or written about Peter.

The account is similar to that of the canonical gospels, especially the [[Gospel of Mark]]. It is unclear whether the fragment is an abridged version of the accounts in the [[synoptic gospels]], or a source text on which they were based, perhaps the apocryphal Gospel of Peter.<ref>''Das Evangelium nach Petrus.

He thus contrasts with [[Paul the Apostle]] who is bald except at the sides, with a longer beard and often black hair, and thinner in the face. One exception to this is in [[Anglo-Saxon art]], where he typically lacks a beard. Both Peter and Paul are shown thus as early as the 4th century [[Catacombs of Marcellinus and Peter]] in Rome.<ref>Higgitt, John, \"The Iconography of Saint Peter in Anglo-Saxon England, and Saint Cuthbert's Coffin\", pp. 267\u2013272, 270 quoted, in: Bonner, Gerald, Rollason, David & Stancliffe, Clare, eds., ''St. Cuthbert, his Cult and his Community to AD 1200''.

By the 15th century Peter is more likely to be bald on the top of his head in the Western church, but he continues to have a good head of hair in Orthodox icons.\n\nThe depiction of Saint Peter as literally the keeper of the gates of heaven, popular with modern cartoonists, is not found in traditional religious art, but Peter usually heads groups of saints flanking God in heaven, on the right hand side (viewer's left) of God. Narrative images of Peter include several scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' where he is mentioned in the gospels, and he is often identifiable in scenes where his presence is not specifically mentioned. Usually he stands nearest to Christ. In particular, depictions of the ''[[Arrest of Christ]]'' usually include Peter cutting off the ear of one of the soldiers. Scenes without Jesus include his distinctive martyrdom, his rescue from prison, and sometimes his trial. In the [[Counter-Reformation]] scenes of Peter hearing the cock crow for the third time became popular, as a representation of [[repentance]] and hence the Catholic [[sacrament]] of [[Confession (sacrament)|Confession]] or Repentance.\n\n==Patronage==\n<!-- This section is linked from the Christian leader infobox at top -->\n[[File:Peter in Chora.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Medieval mosaic of Saint Peter in the [[Chora Church]], Istanbul]]\n[[File:Ancient icon of sts peter & paul.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Icon of Saint Peter and Paul]]\n[[File:Llanbeblig Hours (f. 2v.)

At the beginning of April 1975, Phnom Penh, one of the last remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through [[Pochentong Airport]]. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government [[Operation Eagle Pull|evacuated US nationals and allied Cambodians]] on 12 April 1975. On 17 April the Khmer Republic government evacuated the city intending to establish a new government center close to the [[Thailand|Thai]] border to continue resistance, later that day the last defences around Phnom Penh were overrun and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.\n\nCaptured Khmer Republic forces were taken to the [[Phnom Penh Olympic Stadium|Olympic Stadium]] where they were executed, while senior government and military leaders were forced to write confessions prior to their executions. The Khmer Rouge ordered the evacuation of Phnom Penh, emptying the city except for expatriates who took refuge in the French Embassy until 30 April when they were transported to Thailand.\n\n==Background==\nAt the beginning of 1975 the [[Khmer Republic]], a United States-supported military government, controlled only the Phnom Penh area and a string of towns along the [[Mekong River]] that provided the crucial supply route for food and munitions coming upriver from [[South Vietnam]]. As part of their 1975 dry season offensive, rather than renewing their frontal attacks on Phnom Penh, the [[Khmer Rouge]] set out to cut the crucial Mekong supply route. On 12 January 1975 the Khmer Rouge attacked [[Neak Luong]], a key [[Khmer National Armed Forces]] (FANK) defensive outpost on the Mekong. On 27 January, seven vessels limped into Phnom Penh, the survivors of a 16-ship convoy that had come under attack during the {{convert|100|km}} journey from the South Vietnamese border. On 3 February a convoy heading downriver hit [[naval mine]]s laid by the Khmer Rouge at [[Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9]], approximately {{convert|74|km}} from Phnom Penh. The [[Khmer National Navy]] (MNK) had mine-sweeping capability, but due to the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks mine-sweeping was impossible or, at best, extremely costly.<ref name=Dunham>{{cite book|last=Dunham|first=George R|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: The Bitter End, 1973\u20131975 (Marine Corps Vietnam Operational Historical Series)|publisher=Marine Corps Association|year=1990|url=https://archive.org/details/TheBitterEnd|isbn=978-0-16-026455-9|access-date=2019-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310211317/https://archive.org/details/TheBitterEnd|archive-date=2016-03-10|url-status=live}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|102\u20134}} The MNK had lost a quarter of its ships, and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded.<ref name=Shawcross>{{cite book|title=Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia|last=Shawcross |first=William|publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited|year=1979 |isbn=0-233-97077-0}}</ref>{{rp|347}}\n\nBy 17 February, the Khmer Republic abandoned attempts to reopen the Mekong supply line; all subsequent supplies for Phnom Penh would have to come in by air to [[Pochentong Airport]].<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|105}} The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]],<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|347}} [[BirdAir]], a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of [[C-130]] and [[DC-8]] planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong from [[U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield]].<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|105}}\n\nOn 5 March, Khmer Rouge artillery at Toul Leap ({{Coord|11.574|N|104.757|E|display=inline}}), north-west of Phnom Penh, shelled Pochentong Airport, but FANK troops recaptured Toul Leap on 15 March and ended the shelling. Khmer Rouge forces continued to close in to the north and west of the city and were soon able to fire on Pochentong again. On 22 March rockets hit two supply aircraft, forcing the US Embassy to announce on 23 March a suspension of the airlift until the security situation improved. The Embassy, realizing that the Khmer Republic would soon collapse without supplies, reversed the suspension on 24 March and increased the number of aircraft available for the airlift.<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|105}}<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|358}} The hope among the Khmer Government and the Embassy was that the Khmer Rouge offensive could be held back until the start of the rainy season in May when fighting typically abated.<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|356}}\n\n==Offensive==\n===Late March===\nBy late March the FANK maintained a defensive perimeter some {{convert|15|km}} from central Phnom Penh. In the northwest, the 7th Division was in an increasingly difficult position, its front had been cut in several places, particularly in the region of Toul Leap which had changed hands several times. The 3rd Division, located on [[National Highway 4 (Cambodia)|Route 4]] in the vicinity of Bek Chan ({{Coord|11.51|N|104.748|E|display=inline}}), some {{convert|10|km}} west of Pochentong was cut off from its own command post at [[Chbar Mon Municipality|Kompong Speu]].<ref name=Sak>{{cite book|last=Sutsakhan|first=Lt.

In the region of [[Ta Khmau Municipality|Takhmau]], [[National Highway 1 (Cambodia)|Route 1]] and the [[Bassac River]], the 1st Division was subject to continued Khmer Rouge pressure. East of the capital were the [[Cambodian Para-Commando Battalion|Parachute Brigade]] and the troops of the Phnom Penh Military Region. The MNK naval base on the [[Chrouy Changvar Section|Chrouy Changvar peninsula]] ({{Coord|11.583|N|104.916|E|display=inline}}) and the [[Khmer Air Force]] (KAF) base at Pochentong were defended by their own forces. The key position of Neak Luong on the east bank of the Mekong was completely isolated. The KAF and the MNK were overstretched and undersupplied and could not satisfy the demands of the FANK. The general logistic situation for FANK was increasingly critical and the resupply of ammunition for the infantry could only be carried out sporadically.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|156}}\n\n===1 April===\nPremier [[Lon Nol]] resigned on 1 April. The departure ceremony at the [[National Assembly of Cambodia|Chamcar Mon Palace]] was attended by Khmer only, the diplomatic corps having not been invited. From the grounds of Chamcar Mon, helicopters took Lon Nol, his family and party to Pochentong, where Lon Nol met US Ambassador [[John Gunther Dean]] before boarding an [[Royal Air Cambodge|Air Cambodge]] flight to U-Tapao in [[Thailand]] and into exile.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|158\u201361}}<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|358}} [[Saukam Khoy]] became acting President and it was hoped that with Lon Nol's departure peace negotiations could progress.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|161}}\n\nThe rapidly worsening situation of March was capped on the night of 1 April by the fall of Neak Luong, despite ferocious resistance and following a three-month siege. This development opened the southern approach to the capital and freed up 6000 Khmer Rouge soldiers to join the forces besieging Phnom Penh. The capture of six 105-mm howitzers at Neak Luong was a further menace to the capital.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|156}}<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|105}}<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|358}}\n\n===2\u201311 April===\nFrom 3\u20134 April all FANK positions on Route 1 above Neak Luong held by the FANK 1st Division fell one after the other, any reinforcement, whether by road or by the Mekong, was impossible.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|156}} North of the capital, in the 7th Division area, Khmer Rouge attacks came daily and despite regular air support, there was no improvement in the situation there. Several counterattacks by FANK, carried out to retake lost positions, were unsuccessful. The losses suffered by the 1st Division grew each day and the evacuation of its sick and wounded by helicopter was no longer possible. The last reserves of the high command, constituted by hastily taking the battalions of the former Provincial Guard, were rushed to the north, only to be completely dispersed by the Khmer Rouge after several hours of combat. A great breach was opened in the northern defenses; there was not hope of closing it. To the west, the troops of Brigadier General Chantaraingsei's 3rd Division, despite reinforcements, were unable to join with their own elements at Kompong Speu and to retake the position at Toul Leap. A computation error which caused FANK artillery fire to land on 3rd Division elements during this operation had a bad effect on the unit's morale.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|156\u20137}}\n\nThroughout this period civilian refugees fled toward the capital from all directions. The authorities, both civil and military, were swamped and no one knew where to lodge them. Schools, pagodas and public gardens were occupied by these refugees and there was no way for the authorities to determine who was friend and who was Khmer Rouge.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|157}}\n\nOn 11 April in [[Peking]] the US Government requested the immediate return of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]], the figurehead leader of the [[National United Front of Kampuchea]] (FUNK), to Phnom Penh. Sihanouk rejected the request the following morning.<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|363}}\n\n===12 April===\n[[File:View of Phnom Penh from CH-53.jpg|thumb|right|View of Phnom Penh from a US helicopter, 12 April]]\nWith the situation worsening in Phnom Penh, on 12 April the US Embassy initiated [[Operation Eagle Pull]], the evacuation of all US personnel. Ambassador Dean invited the members of the Government to be evacuated, but all refused except for acting President Saukham Khoy, who left without telling his fellow leaders.<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|114}} The evacuation came as a shock to many in the Khmer Republic leadership, because not only Phnom Penh but almost all provincial capitals (except those in the east occupied by the [[North Vietnam]]ese) were in the hands of the government, packed with millions of refugees. Estimates put the population under government control at six million, and those under Khmer Rouge control at one million.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|162\u20133}}\n\nAt 08:30, the Council of Ministers met in the office of Prime Minister [[Long Boret]]. It was decided that a general assembly should be convoked, consisting of the highest functionaries and military leaders. From 14:00 the general assembly sat in the Chamcar Mon Palace. It finally adopted a unanimous resolution asking for the transfer of power to the military and condemning Saukham Khoy for not handing over his office in a legitimate way. At 23:00 the general assembly elected the members of the Supreme Committee: [[Lieutenant general]] [[Sak Sutsakhan]], the FANK Chief of Staff, [[Major General]] [[Thongvan Fanmuong]], MNK [[Rear admiral]] [[Vong Sarendy]], KAF commander [[Brigadier general]] Ea Chhong, Long Boret, [[Hang Thun Hak]], Vice Prime Minister and Op Kim Ang: representative of the [[Social Republican Party]].<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|164}}\n\nThe military situation had deteriorated sharply during the day. In the north the defensive line was cut at several points by the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the fierce resistance by FANK units. Pochentong Airport was in imminent danger of being taken; the small military airport of [[Mean Chey Section|Mean Chey]] had to be designated as an emergency landing place for the planes and helicopters bringing ammunition and supplies.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|164\u20135}}\n\n===13\u201316 April===\n[[File:Cambodian Civil War map.jpg|thumb|right|The final Khmer Rouge offensive against Phnom Penh]] \n13 April was the [[Cambodian New Year]] and the Khmer Rouge continued to bombard Phnom Penh. At 09:00 the Supreme Committee had its first session and unanimously elected Sak Sutsakhan president, becoming both the head of the government and interim Chief of State. Sak decided to make a last peace offer to Prince Sihanouk, transferring the Republic and its armed forces to him, but not surrendering to the Khmer Rouge. Late that night Sak called a meeting of the Council of Ministers, this time consisting of both the Supreme Committee and the Cabinet, made decisions including certain political and military measures, channeling the ever increasing stream of refugees into schools, pagodas, their feeding, the reshuffling of the cabinet, reinforcing the troops in Phnom Penh by flying in a few battalions from different provinces through the Mean Chey airport and the formation of an Ad Hoc Committee chaired by Long Boret to prepare peace overtures for either Prince Sihanouk or the Khmer Rouge.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|165}}\n\nOn 14 April the military situation was becoming increasingly precarious. That morning the Cabinet met at Sak's office at the General Staff Headquarters ({{Coord|11.567|N|104.925|E|display=inline}}). At 10:25 a KAF pilot dropped four 250-pound bombs from his [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28]] fighter bomber. Two of the bombs exploded about {{convert|20|yd}} from Sak's office killing seven officers and NCOs and wounded twenty others. Sak declared a 24-hour curfew and that the battle would continue. That afternoon Takhmau, the capital of [[Kandal Province]], {{convert|11|km}} south of Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge. The loss of this town, a key point in the FANK defense perimeter, had a demoralizing effect. Several counterattacks were initiated but to no avail. Soon a fierce battle was in progress in the southern suburbs. The U.S. aerial resupply into Pochentong was completely halted.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|166}}<ref name=Swain>{{cite book|last=Swain|first=Jon|title=River of Time: A Memoir of Vietnam and Cambodia|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0425168059|url=https://archive.org/details/riveroftime00swai}}</ref>{{rp|125}}\n\nThe 15th began with the Khmer Rouge pressing in from north and west. Pochentong and the dike running east/west to the north of Phnom Penh, both of which formed the last ring of defense around the capital, were overrun by Khmer Rouge assaults. The intervention of the Parachute Brigade, brought back from the east of the Mekong, had no effect on the situation to the west of the capital. The brigade tried to move west, but was only able to get {{convert|6|km}} down Route 4.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|158}} Meanwhile, refugees continued to pour into the city.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|167}}\n[[File:Aerial reconnaissance view of burning Esso Shell oil storage tank, Phnom Penh, 17 April 1975.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial reconnaissance view of burning Esso Shell oil storage tank, Phnom Penh, 17 April 1975]]\nOn 16 April, the morning Cabinet meeting was devoted entirely to the mechanics of sending a peace offer to Peking as quickly as possible. Long Boret drafted the offer calling for an immediate ceasefire and a transfer of power to FUNK. The offer was sent to Peking via the [[Red Cross]] and the [[Agence France-Presse]]. The military situation was becoming worse, the Shell oil depot ({{Coord|11.607|N|104.917|E|display=inline}}) north of the city was set ablaze by gunfire, while fire swept shacks to the south of the city. All afternoon the Cabinet waited for the answer from Peking. By 23:00 an answer had still not arrived and the Cabinet realized that the Khmer Rouge did not want to accept the offer.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|167\u20138}} Meanwhile, the Khmer Rouge had occupied the east bank of the Mekong following the withdrawal of the Parachute Brigade, while General [[Dien Del]]\u2019s 2nd Division held the [[Monivong Bridge]].<ref name=Swain/>{{rp|126}}\n\nKAF T-28Ds flew their last combat sortie by bombing the KAF control centre and hangars at Pochentong upon its capture by the Khmer Rouge. After virtually expending their ordnance reserves, 97 KAF aircraft escaped from airbases and auxiliary airfields throughout Cambodia, with a small number of civilian dependents on board, to safe havens in neighbouring Thailand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/aa-eastasia/cambodia/cam-af-history2.htm|title=Cambodia: Khmer Air Force History 1970\u20131975 (Part 2)|author=Jan Forsgren|accessdate=4 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113948/http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/aa-eastasia/cambodia/cam-af-history2.htm|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===17 April===\n[[File:Aerial reconnaissance view of the Monivong Bridge, Phnom Penh 17 April 1975.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial reconnaissance view of the Monivong Bridge, Phnom Penh, 17 April 1975]]\nAt 02:00 on 17 April the Cabinet agreed that, as its peace offer had not been accepted, it would move the Cabinet, the Supreme Committee and even members of the Assembly from Phnom Penh to the north to the capital of [[Oddar Meanchey Province]] on the Thai border in order to continue resistance from there. The only way to leave the capital was by helicopter. At 04:00 the members of the Government met in the garden in front of the [[Wat Botum Vaddey]] ({{Coord|11.559|N|104.932|E|display=inline}}) for evacuation, but the helicopters did not show up. Dawn was breaking over the eastern horizon. The Government members returned to Premier Long Boret's house at 05:30 and decided to resist to the death in Phnom Penh itself. After 06:00, the Minister of Information, Thong Lim Huong, brought a cable just arrived from Peking advising that the peace appeal had been rejected by Sihanouk. At the same time they branded the seven members of the Supreme Committee as chief traitors, in addition to the seven who had taken power in 1970.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|168\u20139}}\n\nHeavy fighting had been taking place since 04:00 in the north of the city around the main power station ({{Coord|11.59|N|104.915|E|display=inline}}). By dawn the firing ceased as the FANK forces gave way to the Khmer Rouge and retreated along Monivong Boulevard into the city center.<ref>{{cite book|last=Neveu|first=Roland|title=The Fall of Phnom Penh, 17 April 1975|publisher=Asia Horizons Books Co., Ltd|year=2015|isbn=978-6167277103}}</ref>{{rp|84}} Admiral Vong Sarendy had returned to the naval base which was under attack by the Khmer Rouge.

MONATIO was apparently a creation of Lon Non, in an attempt to share power with the Khmer Rouge.

The PAVN also moved to take control of a number of islands formerly controlled by [[South Vietnam]] and other territory and islands contested between [[Vietnam]] and Cambodia.

At the beginning of April 1975, Phnom Penh, one of the last remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through [[Pochentong Airport]]. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government [[Operation Eagle Pull|evacuated US nationals and allied Cambodians]] on 12 April 1975. On 17 April the Khmer Republic government evacuated the city intending to establish a new government center close to the [[Thailand|Thai]] border to continue resistance, later that day the last defences around Phnom Penh were overrun and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh.\n\nCaptured Khmer Republic forces were taken to the [[Phnom Penh Olympic Stadium|Olympic Stadium]] where they were executed, while senior government and military leaders were forced to write confessions prior to their executions. The Khmer Rouge ordered the evacuation of Phnom Penh, emptying the city except for expatriates who took refuge in the French Embassy until 30 April when they were transported to Thailand.\n\n==Background==\nAt the beginning of 1975 the [[Khmer Republic]], a United States-supported military government, controlled only the Phnom Penh area and a string of towns along the [[Mekong River]] that provided the crucial supply route for food and munitions coming upriver from [[South Vietnam]]. As part of their 1975 dry season offensive, rather than renewing their frontal attacks on Phnom Penh, the [[Khmer Rouge]] set out to cut the crucial Mekong supply route. On 12 January 1975 the Khmer Rouge attacked [[Neak Luong]], a key [[Khmer National Armed Forces]] (FANK) defensive outpost on the Mekong. On 27 January, seven vessels limped into Phnom Penh, the survivors of a 16-ship convoy that had come under attack during the {{convert|100|km}} journey from the South Vietnamese border. On 3 February a convoy heading downriver hit [[naval mine]]s laid by the Khmer Rouge at [[Ph\u00fa M\u1ef9]], approximately {{convert|74|km}} from Phnom Penh. The [[Khmer National Navy]] (MNK) had mine-sweeping capability, but due to the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks mine-sweeping was impossible or, at best, extremely costly.<ref name=Dunham>{{cite book|last=Dunham|first=George R|title=U.S. Marines in Vietnam: The Bitter End, 1973\u20131975 (Marine Corps Vietnam Operational Historical Series)|publisher=Marine Corps Association|year=1990|url=https://archive.org/details/TheBitterEnd|isbn=978-0-16-026455-9|access-date=2019-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310211317/https://archive.org/details/TheBitterEnd|archive-date=2016-03-10|url-status=live}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|102-4}} The MNK had lost a quarter of its ships, and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded.<ref name=Shawcross>{{cite book|title=Sideshow: Kissinger, Nixon and the Destruction of Cambodia|last=Shawcross |first=William|publisher=Andre Deutsch Limited|year=1979 |isbn=0-233-97077-0}}</ref>{{rp|347}}\n\nBy 17 February, the Khmer Republic abandoned attempts to reopen the Mekong supply line; all subsequent supplies for Phnom Penh would have to come in by air to [[Pochentong Airport]].<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|105}} The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the [[Case\u2013Church Amendment]],<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|347}} [[BirdAir]], a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of [[C-130]] and [[DC-8]] planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong from [[U-Tapao Royal Thai Navy Airfield]].<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|105}}\n\nOn 5 March, Khmer Rouge artillery at Toul Leap ({{Coord|11.574|N|104.757|E|display=inline}}), north-west of Phnom Penh, shelled Pochentong Airport, but FANK troops recaptured Toul Leap on 15 March and ended the shelling. Khmer Rouge forces continued to close in to the north and west of the city and were soon able to fire on Pochentong again. On 22 March rockets hit two supply aircraft, forcing the US Embassy to announce on 23 March a suspension of the airlift until the security situation improved. The Embassy, realizing that the Khmer Republic would soon collapse without supplies, reversed the suspension on 24 March and increased the number of aircraft available for the airlift.<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|105}}<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|358}} The hope among the Khmer Government and the Embassy was that the Khmer Rouge offensive could be held back until the start of the rainy season in May when fighting typically abated.<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|356}}\n\n==Offensive==\n===Late March===\nBy late March the FANK maintained a defensive perimeter some {{convert|15|km}} from central Phnom Penh. In the northwest, the 7th Division was in an increasingly difficult position, its front had been cut in several places, particularly in the region of Toul Leap which had changed hands several times. The 3rd Division, located on [[National Highway 4 (Cambodia)|Route 4]] in the vicinity of Bek Chan ({{Coord|11.51|N|104.748|E|display=inline}}), some {{convert|10|km}} west of Pochentong was cut off from its own command post at [[Chbar Mon Municipality|Kompong Speu]].<ref name=Sak>{{cite book|last=Sutsakhan|first=Lt.

In the region of [[Ta Khmau Municipality|Takhmau]], [[National Highway 1 (Cambodia)|Route 1]] and the [[Bassac River]], the 1st Division was subject to continued Khmer Rouge pressure. East of the capital were the [[Cambodian Para-Commando Battalion|Parachute Brigade]] and the troops of the Phnom Penh Military Region. The MNK naval base on the [[Chrouy Changvar Section|Chrouy Changvar peninsula]] ({{Coord|11.583|N|104.916|E|display=inline}}) and the [[Khmer Air Force]] (KAF) base at Pochentong were defended by their own forces. The key position of Neak Luong on the east bank of the Mekong was completely isolated. The KAF and the MNK were overstretched and undersupplied and could not satisfy the demands of the FANK. The general logistic situation for FANK was increasingly critical and the resupply of ammunition for the infantry could only be carried out sporadically.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|156}}\n\n===1 April===\nPremier [[Lon Nol]] resigned on 1 April. The departure ceremony at the [[National Assembly of Cambodia|Chamcar Mon Palace]] was attended by Khmer only, the diplomatic corps having not been invited. From the grounds of Chamcar Mon, helicopters took Lon Nol, his family and party to Pochentong, where Lon Nol met US Ambassador [[John Gunther Dean]] before boarding an [[Royal Air Cambodge|Air Cambodge]] flight to U-Tapao in [[Thailand]] and into exile.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|158\u201361}}<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|358}} [[Saukam Khoy]] became acting President and it was hoped that with Lon Nol\u2019s departure peace negotiations could progress.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|161}}\n\nThe rapidly worsening situation of March was capped on the night of 1 April by the fall of Neak Luong, despite ferocious resistance and following a three month siege. This development opened the southern approach to the capital and freed up 6000 Khmer Rouge soldiers to join the forces besieging Phnom Penh. The capture of six 105-mm howitzers at Neak Luong was a further menace to the capital.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|156}}<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|105}}<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|358}}\n\n===2\u201311 April===\nFrom 3\u20134 April all FANK positions on Route 1 above Neak Luong held by the FANK 1st Division fell one after the other, any reinforcement, whether by road or by the Mekong, was impossible.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|156}} North of the capital, in the 7th Division area, Khmer Rouge attacks came daily and despite regular air support, there was no improvement in the situation there. Several counterattacks by FANK, carried out to retake lost positions, were unsuccessful. The losses suffered by the 1st Division grew each day and the evacuation of its sick and wounded by helicopter was no longer possible. The last reserves of the high command, constituted by hastily taking the battalions of the former Provincial Guard, were rushed to the north, only to be completely dispersed by the Khmer Rouge after several hours of combat. A great breach was opened in the northern defenses; there was not hope of closing it. To the west, the troops of Brigadier General Chantaraingsei's 3rd Division, despite reinforcements, were unable to join with their own elements at Kompong Speu and to retake the position at Toul Leap. A computation error which caused FANK artillery fire to land on 3rd Division elements during this operation had a bad effect on the unit\u2019s morale.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|156\u20137}}\n\nThroughout this period civilian refugees fled toward the capital from all directions. The authorities, both civil and military, were swamped and no one knew where to lodge them. Schools, pagodas and public gardens were occupied by these refugees and there was no way for the authorities to determine who was friend and who was Khmer Rouge.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|157}}\n\nOn 11 April in [[Peking]] the US Government requested the immediate return of Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]], the figurehead leader of the [[National United Front of Kampuchea]] (FUNK), to Phnom Penh. Sihanouk rejected the request the following morning.<ref name=Shawcross/>{{rp|363}}\n\n===12 April===\n[[File:View of Phnom Penh from CH-53.jpg|thumb|right|View of Phnom Penh from a US helicopter, 12 April]]\nWith the situation worsening in Phnom Penh, on 12 April the US Embassy initiated [[Operation Eagle Pull]], the evacuation of all US personnel. Ambassador Dean invited the members of the Government to be evacuated, but all refused except for acting President Saukham Khoy, who left without telling his fellow leaders.<ref name=Dunham/>{{rp|114}} The evacuation came as a shock to many in the Khmer Republic leadership, because not only Phnom Penh but almost all provincial capitals (except those in the east occupied by the [[North Vietnam]]ese) were in the hands of the government, packed with millions of refugees. Estimates put the population under government control at six million, and those under Khmer Rouge control at one million.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|162\u20133}}\n\nAt 08:30, the Council of Ministers met in the office of Prime Minister [[Long Boret]]. It was decided that a general assembly should be convoked, consisting of the highest functionaries and military leaders. From 14:00 the general assembly sat in the Chamcar Mon Palace. It finally adopted a unanimous resolution asking for the transfer of power to the military and condemning Saukham Khoy for not handing over his office in a legitimate way. At 23:00 the general assembly elected the members of the Supreme Committee: [[Lieutenant general]] [[Sak Sutsakhan]], the FANK Chief of Staff, [[Major General]] [[Thongvan Fanmuong]], MNK [[Rear admiral]] [[Vong Sarendy]], KAF commander [[Brigadier general]] Ea Chhong, Long Boret, [[Hang Thun Hak]], Vice Prime Minister and Op Kim Ang: representative of the [[Social Republican Party]].<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|164}}\n\nThe military situation had deteriorated sharply during the day. In the north the defensive line was cut at several points by the Khmer Rouge, in spite of the fierce resistance by FANK units. Pochentong Airport was in imminent danger of being taken; the small military airport of [[Mean Chey Section|Mean Chey]] had to be designated as an emergency landing place for the planes and helicopters bringing ammunition and supplies.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|164\u20135}}\n\n===13\u201316 April===\n[[File:Cambodian Civil War map.jpg|thumb|right|The final Khmer Rouge offensive against Phnom Penh]] \n13 April was the [[Cambodian New Year]] and the Khmer Rouge continued to bombard Phnom Penh. At 09:00 the Supreme Committee had its first session and unanimously elected Sak Sutsakhan president, becoming both the head of the government and interim Chief of State. Sak decided to make a last peace offer to Prince Sihanouk, transferring the Republic and its armed forces to him, but not surrendering to the Khmer Rouge. Late that night Sak called a meeting of the Council of Ministers, this time consisting of both the Supreme Committee and the Cabinet, made decisions including certain political and military measures, channeling the ever increasing stream of refugees into schools, pagodas, their feeding, the reshuffling of the cabinet, reinforcing the troops in Phnom Penh by flying in a few battalions from different provinces through the Mean Chey airport and the formation of an Ad Hoc Committee chaired by Long Boret to prepare peace overtures for either Prince Sihanouk or the Khmer Rouge.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|165}}\n\nOn 14 April the military situation was becoming increasingly precarious. That morning the Cabinet met at Sak\u2019s office at the General Staff Headquarters ({{Coord|11.567|N|104.925|E|display=inline}}). At 10:25 a KAF pilot dropped four 250-pound bombs from his [[North American T-28 Trojan|T-28]] fighter bomber. Two of the bombs exploded about {{convert|20|yd}} from Sak\u2019s office killing seven officers and NCOs and wounded twenty others. Sak declared a 24 hour curfew and that the battle would continue. That afternoon Takhmau, the capital of [[Kandal Province]], {{convert|11|km}} south of Phnom Penh fell to the Khmer Rouge. The loss of this town, a key point in the FANK defense perimeter, had a demoralizing effect. Several counterattacks were initiated but to no avail. Soon a fierce battle was in progress in the southern suburbs. The U.S. aerial resupply into Pochentong was completely halted.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|166}}<ref name=Swain>{{cite book|last=Swain|first=Jon|title=River of Time: A Memoir of Vietnam and Cambodia|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|year=1997|isbn=978-0425168059|url=https://archive.org/details/riveroftime00swai}}</ref>{{rp|125}}\n\nThe 15th began with the Khmer Rouge pressing in from north and west. Pochentong and the dike running east/west to the north of Phnom Penh, both of which formed the last ring of defense around the capital, were overrun by Khmer Rouge assaults. The intervention of the Parachute Brigade, brought back from the east of the Mekong, had no effect on the situation to the west of the capital.

Long Boret drafted the offer calling for an immediate ceasefire and a transfer of power to FUNK. The offer was sent to Peking via the [[Red Cross]] and the [[Agence France-Presse]]. The military situation was becoming worse, the Shell oil depot ({{Coord|11.607|N|104.917|E|display=inline}}) north of the city was set ablaze by gunfire, while fire swept shacks to the south of the city. All afternoon the Cabinet waited for the answer from Peking.

The only way to leave the capital was by helicopter. At 04:00 the members of the Government met in the garden in front of the [[Wat Botum Vaddey]] ({{Coord|11.559|N|104.932|E|display=inline}}) for evacuation, but the helicopters did not show up. Dawn was breaking over the eastern horizon. The Government members returned to Premier Long Boret's house at 05:30 and decided to resist to the death in Phnom Penh itself. After 06:00, the Minister of Information, Thong Lim Huong, brought a cable just arrived from Peking advising that the peace appeal had been rejected by Sihanouk.

Captured FANK officers were taken to the Hotel Monoram to write their biographies and then to the Olympic Stadium, where they were executed.<ref name=Becker/>{{rp|192\u20133}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn the morning of 18 April, Sak and the remaining members of the Khmer Republic Government and assorted military personnel boarded a KAF [[Fairchild C-123 Provider|C-123]] and flew to U-Tapao and into exile.<ref name=Sak/>{{rp|170\u20131}} The same day the Khmer Rouge ordered all Cambodians in the French Embassy, other than women married to Frenchmen, to leave the Embassy or they would take it over; they rejected any right of asylum.

Supporters of the Khmer Republic and the [[intelligentsia]] were killed, while the former urban population was used as [[forced labor]] in the countryside with many dying from physical abuse and malnutrition. This ultimately resulting in 1.5-2 million deaths during the [[Cambodian Genocide]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Heuveline|first=Patrick|title='Between One and Three Million': Towards the Demographic Reconstruction of a Decade of Cambodian History (1970\u201379)|journal=Population Studies|year=1998|volume=52|issue=1|doi=10.1080/0032472031000150176|pmid=11619945|jstor=2584763|pages=49\u201365}}</ref>\n\nThe Khmer Rouge severed all contact with the outside world other than with its supporters, China and North Vietnam. With the [[Fall of Saigon]] on 30 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge demanded that all [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) and [[Viet Cong]] forces leave their base areas in Cambodia, but the PAVN refused to leave certain areas which they claimed were Vietnamese territory. The PAVN also moved to take control of a number of islands formerly controlled by [[South Vietnam]] and other territory and islands contested between [[Vietnam]] and Cambodia. This led to a series of clashes between Vietnam and Cambodia on several islands in May 1975 and the seizure of foreign ships by the Khmer Rouge which triggered the [[Mayaguez Incident|''Mayaguez'' incident]].<ref name=Becker/>{{rp|195}} Clashes between Cambodia and Vietnam continued until August 1975.<ref name=Becker/>{{rp|198}} Relations between the two countries improved thereafter until early 1977 when the [[Kampuchean Revolutionary Army]] began attacking Vietnamese border provinces, killing hundreds of Vietnamese civilians; this eventually resulted in the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War]] starting in December 1978.<ref name=Becker/>{{rp|304}}\n\n==In popular culture==\nThe Fall of Phnom Penh is depicted in the film ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Freedman|first=Samuel G.|title=In 'The Killing Fields,' A Cambodian Actor Relives His Nation's Ordeal|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940CEEDE1539F93BA15753C1A962948260&pagewanted=all|date=28 October 1984|accessdate=14 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qncy06fN8LA Video of Roland Neveu discussing his photos from the fall of Phnom Penh]\n\n[[Category:Battles and operations of the Vietnam War in 1975|Fall of Phnom Penh]]\n[[Category:Evacuations]]\n[[Category:History of Phnom Penh]]\n[[Category:Military history of Cambodia]]\n[[Category:1975 in Cambodia]]\n[[Category:April 1975 events in Asia]]\n[[Category:20th century in Phnom Penh]]\n", "name_user": "JHunterJ", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: Meanwhile \u2192 Meanwhile, (3), three month \u2192 three-month (2), \u2019s \u2192 's (7), replaced: 2 million \u2192 2\u00a0million", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Phnom_Penh"}
