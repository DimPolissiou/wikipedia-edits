Southern planters and businessmen traveled there regularly and had their own favorite hotels.<ref name=\"stone\"/> \n\nIn 1799, New York passed a gradual abolition statute and in 1817, New York passed a law freeing all slaves in the state on July 4, 1827. The 1817 law stated:\n<blockquote>''No person held as a slave shall be imported, introduced, or brought into this State on any pretence whatever ... . Every such person shall be free. ...''<ref>Laws of 1817, 136, \u00a79; 20 N.Y., 601; 5 S.S.C., 681; 26 B., 272. ''See'' ''Statutes at Large'' (as of July 1, 1862) edited by John W.

The Lemmons had brought with them eight slaves belonging to Mrs. Lemmon. They made up two family groups, each headed by a young woman: the first was Emiline (age 23), Edward (age 13), brother of Emiline; and Amanda (age 2), daughter of Emiline. The second was Nancy (age 20); Lewis (age 16), brother of Nancy; Lewis and Edward (age 7), sons of Nancy; and Ann (age 5), daughter of Nancy. The older members of the groups served the Lemmons as domestic slaves. While the Lemmons awaited the ship to Texas, they placed their slaves in a boarding house at No. 3 Carlisle Street and booked another hotel for themselves.\n\nLouis Napoleon, a free African-American resident of New York and activist with the [[Underground Railroad]], was alerted to the arrival of the slaves by a black porter at the boarding house about the slaves who had been brought there. Black citizens of New York regularly aided slaves brought to the city to gain freedom by force of state law.\n\nOn 6 November 1852, Napoleon presented a petition to Judge Elijah Paine Jr., of the Superior Court of New York City, for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' that would effectively emancipate the slaves. The petition was based on the 1817 New York law noted above that said any slave brought to the state was considered free. \n\nMr. Lemmon's attorneys objected. They asserted that the Lemmons were transporting their slaves from Virginia to Texas, claiming this was an action of interstate commerce, as slaves were considered property in southern states. They cited the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' (1824) that states had no power to regulate interstate commerce, as that power was granted to the federal government.\n\nThe state of New York designated lawyers to appear in support of the petition, including [[John Jay (lawyer)|John Jay]], [[Erastus D. Culver]], and [[Chester Alan Arthur]]. They argued that the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] granted limited powers to the federal government, and those powers not granted were reserved for the states. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] and the Supreme Court's precedent in ''Prigg v. Pennsylvania'' (1842)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]:  Understanding Justice Story's Pro-Slavery Nationalism |journal=Journal of Supreme Court History |date=1997 |volume=2 |page=51-64}}</ref> prohibited the states from interfering in the return of fugitive slaves. But New York argued that this explicit requirement implicitly excluded any requirement for states to return non-fugitive slaves, by the principle ''expressio unius exclusio alterius'' (\"the express mention of one thing excludes others\").\n\n==Proceedings==\nOn November 13, 1852, Judge Paine held that the Lemmons were not required to travel to Texas via New York.  Thus, they had chosen to bring their slaves to New York, knowing it was a free state. Thus, the slaves were free according to New York state law forbidding bringing slaves \"in transit\" into the state.  Paine relied on the English precedent set in ''[[Somersett's Case|Somersett v. Stewart]]'' (1772), where the [[Court of King's Bench]] declared that only positive law could uphold slavery and that, since England had no laws upholding slavery, slaves entering English territory became free.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordan|2006||pp=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\nAfter his decision, Judge Paine organized a subscription. He arranged to pay Lemmon the full value of the slaves. When the case reached the New York Court of Appeals, John Jay II, submitted an ''amicus curiae'' brief arguing that, inasmuch as Lemmon suffered no loss, he had no justiciable controversy.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/16/news/law-intelligence-decision-in-the-lemmon-slave-case.html|title=Law Intelligence: Decision in the Lemmon Slave Case|work=New York Times|date=April 18, 1860|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe State of Virginia assisted Lemmon in his appeal to the [[New York Supreme Court]] granted ''[[certiorari]]''.<ref name=NYT/> The court affirmed Justice Paine in December 1857 with one dissent. Lemmon appealed again, to the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (the state's highest appellate court). The Court of Appeals affirmed by a vote of 5-3 in March 1860, holding that the slaves were free.\n\nThe Lemmons assigned their rights to the State of Virginia, which had planned to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. By then the [[American Civil War]] had begun and the case was never heard.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordan|2006||page=12}}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\n\nShortly after reporting the decision of the Court of Appeals, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article criticizing the opinions of the two dissenting judges in the Lemmon case. First it addressed judicial decisions in general, including in the South, saying that the country's polarization on slavery was resulting in biased decisions by judges. It noted that cases were being decided against free blacks and against the ability of owners to free slaves by will, because opinions were overriding precedent. It said \n<blockquote>\"judges are gradually giving way to the pressure of one side or other, and ceasing even to pretend to administer the law as they find it, or to stand by the old rules of interpretation in any case in which the interests of slaveholders are involved.\" Although the piece noted that in the North, \"the evil has been less apparent,\" preferring errors that favored freedom rather than slavery, decisions based on the Fugitive Slave Law \"have at least rarely been illustrations of judicial wisdom, moderation, and impartiality.\"</blockquote> \n\nThe article reviewed the dissents of Chief Judge Comstock and Judge Selden in the Lemmon case. Both men had noted in their dissents that they had not the time to give the case a thorough consideration. But nonetheless they dissented, saying that the New York statute prohibiting slaveowners from bringing slaves in transit into the state, violated \"the rules of justice and comity\" that ought to regulate intercourse among the states. The ''Times'' said the judges had overstepped their bounds by creating a new standard: \"If this rule does not arm judges with legislative power, we should like to hear of some other plan which does it more effectually.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/26/news/the-lemmon-slave-case.html?pagewanted=all|title=The Lemmon Slave Case|work=New York Times|date=April 26, 1860|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Lemmon'' was still pending, United States Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Nelson]], from New York, \"had hinted at constitutional restraints upon State power over slavery\" in his concurrence to ''[[Dred Scott v. Sanford|Scott v. Sandford]]''.<ref>[[Allan Nevins]] (1950), ''Ordeal of the Union'', Vol. 3, ''The Emergence of Lincoln: Douglas, Buchanan, and Party Chaos'', New York: Scribner's, Ch. 13, \"Douglas under Challenge\", p. 362.</ref> Nelson noted that the question of slaveholders' right to take slaves into or through free states had not been under consideration in Dred Scott:  \n<blockquote>\"A question has been alluded to, on the argument, namely: the right of the master with his slave of transit into or through a free State, on business or commercial pursuits, or in the exercise of a Federal right, or the discharge of a Federal duty, being a citizen of the United States, which is not before us.  This question depends upon different considerations and principles from the one in hand, and turns upon the rights and privileges secured to a common citizen of the republic under the Constitution of the United States. When that question arises, we shall be prepared to decide it.\"<ref>''Scott v. Sandford'', 468.</ref></blockquote>Don E. Fehrenbaccher later suggested that Nelson thought the Supreme Court might be required to rule on the issue of slaves carried to free states..<ref>[[Don E. Fehrenbacher]] (1978), ''The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American Law and Politics'', 2001 reprint, New York:  Oxford, Part 2, \"A Decade of Litigation\", Ch. 17, \"Concurrence and Dissent\", p. 394, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514588-5}} .</ref>\n\n[[Lincoln's House Divided Speech]] on 1858 outlined the threat if the Supreme Court followed thinking related to Dred Scott when ruling on the right of states to regulate slavery:  \n<blockquote>\"The nearest approach to the point of declarating the power of a state over slavery, is made by Judge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using the precise idea, and ''almost'' the language too, of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act|Nebraska Act]]. On one occasion, his exact language is 'except in cases where the power is restrained by the Constitution of the United States, the law of the State is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction.' In what cases the power of the ''states'' is so restrained by the U.S. Constitution, is left an ''open'' question, precisely as the question as to the power of the ''territories'' was left open in the Nebraska Act. Put ''that'' and ''that'' together, and we have a nice little niche, which we may, ere long, see filled with another Supreme Court decision, declaring that the Constitution of the United States does not permit a ''state'' to exclude slavery from its limits.\"<ref>[[Abraham Lincoln]], at the [[Illinois State Capitol]], Springfield, IL, June 16, 1858. [Lincoln's emphases].</ref></blockquote>As noted, the outbreak of war meant that the Supreme Court never heard Virginia's appeal of the Lemmon case.\n\nHistorian [[Paul Finkelman]] noted in his book<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref> on the history of slave transit in the North that \"Lemmon was the culmination of a long and intense conflict over the place of slavery within the legal framework of the Union.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |page=310 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref> Finkelman also noted that Lemmon was  \"part of the larger social and political movements that ultimately led to the Republican party, the Civil War, and Constitutional amendments ending slavery and making blacks full-fledged citizens.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |page=310-311 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref>The importance of Lemmon was clear to the South.  In explaining why it was leaving the Union, the South Carolina Secession Convention noted: \"In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union: and the Ordinance of Secession |date=1860 |publisher=Evans and Cogswell |location=Charlston, SC |page=8 |url=https://www.atlantahistorycenter.com/assets/documents/SCarolina-Secession-p1-13.pdf |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nYears later Chester A. Arthur took credit for promoting the rights of slaves (and the state) in this case. Historian Thomas C. Reeves said that Arthur did not contribute work that was any more important than that of John Jay (who sponsored the case and designed the strategy), or [[William M.

Southern planters and businessmen traveled there regularly and had their own favorite hotels.<ref name=\"stone\"/> \n\nNew York had abolished slavery gradually from 1799, freeing its last slaves on July 4, 1827. An 1817 law stated:\n<blockquote>''No person held as a slave shall be imported, introduced, or brought into this State on any pretence whatever ... . Every such person shall be free. ...''<ref>Laws of 1817, 136, \u00a79; 20 N.Y., 601; 5 S.S.C., 681; 26 B., 272. ''See'' ''Statutes at Large'' (as of July 1, 1862) edited by John W.

[[John Jay (lawyer)|John Jay]] (1817-1894) was prominent among them and the city's leading lawyer for the defense in [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|fugitive slave cases]]. (Jay's [[John Jay|grandfather]], for whom he was named, was the diplomat for the [[Continental Congress]]; during the George Washington administration, he served as Governor of New York and as first Chief Justice of the United States.) The 1850 federal law required even the law enforcement of free states to support the capture and return of fugitive slaves. <ref name=\"stone\">{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/little-known-history-underground-railroad-new-york-180953927/?no-ist|last=Stone|first=Anrea|title=The Little-Known History of the Underground Railroad in New York|work=Smithsonian Magazine|date=January 20, 2015|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref> \n\nLouis Napoleon, an illiterate former slave who became a furniture polisher and porter, was active in aiding escaped slaves' efforts to gain freedom via the Underground Railroad.

The Lemmons had brought with them eight slaves belonging to Mrs. Lemmon. They made up two family groups, each headed by a young woman: the first was Emiline (age 23), Edward (age 13), brother of Emiline; and Amanda (age 2), daughter of Emiline. The second was Nancy (age 20); Lewis (age 16), brother of Nancy; Lewis and Edward (age 7), sons of Nancy; and Ann (age 5), daughter of Nancy. The older members of the groups served the Lemmons as domestic slaves. While the Lemmons awaited the ship to Texas, they placed their slaves in a boarding house at No. 3 Carlisle Street and booked another hotel for themselves.\n\nLouis Napoleon, a free African-American resident of New York and activist with the [[Underground Railroad]], was alerted to the arrival of the slaves by a black porter at the boarding house about the slaves who had been brought there. Black citizens of New York regularly aided slaves brought to the city to gain freedom by force of state law.\n\nOn 6 November 1852, Napoleon presented a petition to Judge Elijah Paine Jr., of the Superior Court of New York City, for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' that would effectively emancipate the slaves. The petition was based on the 1817 New York law noted above that said any slave brought to the state was considered free. \n\nMr. Lemmon's attorneys objected. They asserted that the Lemmons were transporting their slaves from Virginia to Texas, claiming this was an action of interstate commerce, as slaves were considered property in southern states. They cited the [[United States Supreme Court]]'s ruling in ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'' (1824) that states had no power to regulate interstate commerce, as that power was granted to the federal government.\n\nThe state of New York designated lawyers to appear in support of the petition, including [[John Jay (lawyer)|John Jay]], [[Erastus D. Culver]], and [[Chester Alan Arthur]]. They argued that the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] granted limited powers to the federal government, and those powers not granted were reserved for the states. The [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]] and the Supreme Court's precedent in ''Prigg v. Pennsylvania'' (1842)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=[[Prigg v. Pennsylvania]]:  Understanding Justice Story's Pro-Slavery Nationalism |journal=Journal of Supreme Court History |date=1997 |volume=2 |page=51-64}}</ref> prohibited the states from interfering in the return of fugitive slaves. But New York argued that this explicit requirement implicitly excluded any requirement for states to return non-fugitive slaves, by the principle ''expressio unius exclusio alterius'' (\"the express mention of one thing excludes others\").\n\n==Proceedings==\nOn November 13, 1852, Judge Paine held that the Lemmons were not required to travel to Texas via New York.  Thus, they had chosen to bring their slaves to New York, knowing it was a free state. Thus, the slaves were free according to New York state law forbidding bringing slaves \"in transit\" into the state.  Paine relied on the English precedent set in ''[[Somersett's Case|Somersett v. Stewart]]'' (1772), where the [[Court of King's Bench]] declared that only positive law could uphold slavery and that, since England had no laws upholding slavery, slaves entering English territory became free.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordan|2006||pp=11\u201312}}</ref>\n\nAfter his decision, Judge Paine organized a subscription. He arranged to pay Lemmon the full value of the slaves. When the case reached the New York Court of Appeals, John Jay II, submitted an ''amicus curiae'' brief arguing that, inasmuch as Lemmon suffered no loss, he had no justiciable controversy.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/16/news/law-intelligence-decision-in-the-lemmon-slave-case.html|title=Law Intelligence: Decision in the Lemmon Slave Case|work=New York Times|date=April 18, 1860|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe State of Virginia assisted Lemmon in his appeal to the [[New York Supreme Court]] granted ''[[certiorari]]''.<ref name=NYT/> The court affirmed Justice Paine in December 1857 with one dissent. Lemmon appealed again, to the [[New York Court of Appeals]] (the state's highest appellate court). The Court of Appeals affirmed by a vote of 5-3 in March 1860, holding that the slaves were free.\n\nThe Lemmons assigned their rights to the State of Virginia, which had planned to appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. By then the [[American Civil War]] had begun and the case was never heard.<ref>{{harvnb|Gordan|2006||page=12}}</ref>\n\n==Reaction==\n\nShortly after reporting the decision of the Court of Appeals, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published an article criticizing the opinions of the two dissenting judges in the Lemmon case. First it addressed judicial decisions in general, including in the South, saying that the country's polarization on slavery was resulting in biased decisions by judges. It noted that cases were being decided against free blacks and against the ability of owners to free slaves by will, because opinions were overriding precedent. It said \n<blockquote>\"judges are gradually giving way to the pressure of one side or other, and ceasing even to pretend to administer the law as they find it, or to stand by the old rules of interpretation in any case in which the interests of slaveholders are involved.\" Although the piece noted that in the North, \"the evil has been less apparent,\" preferring errors that favored freedom rather than slavery, decisions based on the Fugitive Slave Law \"have at least rarely been illustrations of judicial wisdom, moderation, and impartiality.\"</blockquote> \n\nThe article reviewed the dissents of Chief Judge Comstock and Judge Selden in the Lemmon case. Both men had noted in their dissents that they had not the time to give the case a thorough consideration. But nonetheless they dissented, saying that the New York statute prohibiting slaveowners from bringing slaves in transit into the state, violated \"the rules of justice and comity\" that ought to regulate intercourse among the states. The ''Times'' said the judges had overstepped their bounds by creating a new standard: \"If this rule does not arm judges with legislative power, we should like to hear of some other plan which does it more effectually.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1860/04/26/news/the-lemmon-slave-case.html?pagewanted=all|title=The Lemmon Slave Case|work=New York Times|date=April 26, 1860|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile ''Lemmon'' was still pending, United States Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Nelson]], from New York, \"had hinted at constitutional restraints upon State power over slavery\" in his concurrence to ''[[Dred Scott v. Sanford|Scott v. Sandford]]''.<ref>[[Allan Nevins]] (1950), ''Ordeal of the Union'', Vol. 3, ''The Emergence of Lincoln: Douglas, Buchanan, and Party Chaos'', New York: Scribner's, Ch. 13, \"Douglas under Challenge\", p. 362.</ref> Nelson noted that the question of slaveholders' right to take slaves into or through free states had not been under consideration in Dred Scott:  \n<blockquote>\"A question has been alluded to, on the argument, namely: the right of the master with his slave of transit into or through a free State, on business or commercial pursuits, or in the exercise of a Federal right, or the discharge of a Federal duty, being a citizen of the United States, which is not before us.  This question depends upon different considerations and principles from the one in hand, and turns upon the rights and privileges secured to a common citizen of the republic under the Constitution of the United States. When that question arises, we shall be prepared to decide it.\"<ref>''Scott v. Sandford'', 468.</ref></blockquote>Don E. Fehrenbaccher later suggested that Nelson thought the Supreme Court might be required to rule on the issue of slaves carried to free states..<ref>[[Don E. Fehrenbacher]] (1978), ''The Dred Scott Case: Its Significance in American Law and Politics'', 2001 reprint, New York:  Oxford, Part 2, \"A Decade of Litigation\", Ch. 17, \"Concurrence and Dissent\", p. 394, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514588-5}} .</ref>\n\n[[Lincoln's House Divided Speech]] on 1858 outlined the threat if the Supreme Court followed thinking related to Dred Scott when ruling on the right of states to regulate slavery:  \n<blockquote>\"The nearest approach to the point of declarating the power of a state over slavery, is made by Judge Nelson. He approaches it more than once, using the precise idea, and ''almost'' the language too, of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act|Nebraska Act]]. On one occasion, his exact language is 'except in cases where the power is restrained by the Constitution of the United States, the law of the State is supreme over the subject of slavery within its jurisdiction.' In what cases the power of the ''states'' is so restrained by the U.S. Constitution, is left an ''open'' question, precisely as the question as to the power of the ''territories'' was left open in the Nebraska Act. Put ''that'' and ''that'' together, and we have a nice little niche, which we may, ere long, see filled with another Supreme Court decision, declaring that the Constitution of the United States does not permit a ''state'' to exclude slavery from its limits.\"<ref>[[Abraham Lincoln]], at the [[Illinois State Capitol]], Springfield, IL, June 16, 1858. [Lincoln's emphases].</ref></blockquote>As noted, the outbreak of war meant that the Supreme Court never heard Virginia's appeal of the Lemmon case.\n\nHistorian [[Paul Finkelman]] noted in his book<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref> on the history of slave transit in the North that \"Lemmon was the culmination of a long and intense conflict over the place of slavery within the legal framework of the Union.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |page=310 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref> Finkelman also noted that Lemmon was  \"part of the larger social and political movements that ultimately led to the Republican party, the Civil War, and Constitutional amendments ending slavery and making blacks full-fledged citizens.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Finkelman |first1=Paul |title=An Imperfect Union: Slavery, Federalism, and Comity |date=1981 |publisher=Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1584770923 |page=310-311 |edition=Reprint 2000}}</ref>The importance of Lemmon was clear to the South.  In explaining why it was leaving the Union, the South Carolina Secession Convention noted: \"In the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union: and the Ordinance of Secession |date=1860 |publisher=Evans and Cogswell |location=Charlston, SC |page=8 |url=https://www.atlantahistorycenter.com/assets/documents/SCarolina-Secession-p1-13.pdf |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nYears later Chester A. Arthur took credit for promoting the rights of slaves (and the state) in this case. Historian Thomas C.

This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992 that aired on [[Prime Ticket]], a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993 that was never aired, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams.

The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]].

The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]].

He announced the promotion's formation at John Arezzi's ''Wrestling Fans Fantasy Weekend'' convention in August 1990. Despite having no experience in the wrestling business, Abrams was given a budget of $1 million by [[SportsChannel America]] to develop a weekly television series, which would become ''Fury Hour''.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 134.</ref> The first ''Fury Hour'' tapings were held at [[Reseda Country Club]] in the Fall of 1990 and featured established stars such as [[Paul Orndorff]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Bob Orton, Jr.]], [[Brian Blair]], [[Dan Spivey]], [[Billy Jack Haynes]], [[Ken Patera]], [[Colonel DeBeers]], [[David Sammartino]], [[Ivan Koloff]], and [[Mick Foley|Cactus Jack]].<ref name=mf184>Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.184)</ref> The top homegrown talent included \"Wild Thing\" Steve Ray and \"Cutie Pie\" [[Louie Spicolli]]. [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Lou Albano]] were hired as commentators.\n\nThe promotion held a taping in [[New York City]] at the [[New York Penta]] in January 1991 that was plagued with legal issues. The World Wrestling Federation sent cease and desist orders after [[The Honky Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]] and [[Rick Rude]] appeared on-camera.<ref name=02041991WON>{{cite web|url=https://members.f4wonline.com/wrestling-observer-newsletter/feb-4-1991-observer-newsletter-pivotal-week-life-dave-meltzer-89881|title=February 4, 1991 Observer Newsletter: Pivotal week in the life of Dave Meltzer|author=Observer Staff|publisher=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|website=F4WOnline.com|date=February 4, 1991|accessdate=September 7, 2019}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Both had recently walked out of the WWF but were still under contract to the company. Honky Tonk Man would later explain that the check he received from Abrams for this taping bounced, and he filed a formal complaint with the [[New York State Athletic Commission]] to get reimbursed.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9r6kIfzFSSM</ref>\n\nAbrams hired Howard Brody, the owner of [[Ladies Major League Wrestling]], to help him expand UWF into the Florida market in mid-1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992 that aired on [[Prime Ticket]], a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993 that was never aired, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|executive_producer = Lenny Duge\n|starring = See [[List of former Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) personnel|UWF alumni]]\n|country = United States\n|location = [[Reseda Country Club]] <small>(1990)</small><br>[[New York Penta]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Universal Studios Florida]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[War Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1991)</small><br>[[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] <small>(1992)</small>\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]] <small>(1990-1991)</small><br>[[Prime Ticket]] <small>(1992)</small><br>[[ESPN2]] <small>(1995)</small>\n|first_aired = October 1, 1990\n|last_aired = 1992\n|num_episodes = 69\n|list_episodes = List of UWF Fury Hour episodes\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year television deal with [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and aired on Monday nights as part of the network's new ''Feet, Fists and Fury'' programming block that also included [[kickboxing]] and [[boxing]].<ref>https://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/90-OCR/BC-1990-09-17-OCR-Page-0043.pdf</ref>\n\nAbrams signed a deal with [[Prime Ticket]] in June 1992 for the production and broadcast of new content.<ref>Meltzer, Dave.

fourth studio album by Canadian singer [[The Weeknd]]. The album was released by [[XO (record label)|XO]] and [[Republic Records]] on March 20, 2020. It is The Weeknd's first studio album since 2016's ''[[Starboy (album)|Starboy]]'', following the release of the 2018 [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[My Dear Melancholy]]''. The album is dedicated to a fan, who passed away shortly before the album's release. The standard edition has no featured artists, and the deluxe edition features remixed tracks, with [[guest appearance]]s from [[Chromatics (band)|Chromatics]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]], along with additional production from [[The Blaze (band)|The Blaze]], [[Johnny Jewel]], and [[Oneohtrix Point Never|OPN]]. ''After Hours''{{'}} deluxe edition was later updated to include three new bonus tracks.\n\nThe artwork and aesthetic for the album's promotional material has been described as psychedelic and being inspired by various films, such as: ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (film)|Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Joker (2019 film)|Joker]]'', ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]'', and ''[[Uncut Gems]]'', with the last film having a cameo appearance by The Weeknd himself. The project has been supported by three singles: \"[[Heartless (The Weeknd song)|Heartless]]\", \"[[Blinding Lights]]\", and \"[[In Your Eyes (The Weeknd song)|In Your Eyes]]\". One promotional single has been released as well, the album's [[After Hours (The Weeknd song)|title track]]. \n\nOn March 19, 2020, a record 1.02 million users pre-added ''After Hours'' to their [[Apple Music]] library.

The most prevalent anatomical region of neuropil is the [[brain]] which, although not completely composed of neuropil, does have the largest and highest synaptically-concentrated areas of neuropil in the body. For example, the [[neocortex]] and [[olfactory bulb]] both contain neuropil.<ref name=\"Purves\">{{cite book|title=Neuroscience|year=2012|publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc.|location=Sunderland, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-87893-695-3|edition=Fifth|editor1=Dale Purves |editor2=George J.

''How Brains Make up their Minds '', 2000, p. 47</ref> The term's origin can be traced back to the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pearsall|first=Judy|title=Neuropil|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/neuropil|work=Oxford Dictionaries Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=20 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\nNeuropil has been found in the following regions: outer neocortex layer, [[barrel cortex]], [[inner plexiform layer]] and [[outer plexiform layer]], [[posterior pituitary]], and glomeruli of the [[cerebellum]]. These are all found in humans, with the exception of the barrel cortex, but many species have counterparts similar to our own regions of neuropil. However, the degree of similarity depends upon the composition of neuropil being compared. The concentrations of neuropil within certain regions are important to determine because simply using the proportions of the different postsynaptic elements does not verify the necessary, conclusive evidence. Comparing the concentrations can determine whether or not proportions of different postsynaptic elements contacted a particular axonal pathway. Relative concentrations could signify a reflection of different postsynaptic elements in the neuropil or show that axons sought out and formed synapses only with specific postsynaptic elements.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book|last=White|first=Edward L.|title=Cortical Circuits Synaptic Organization of the Cerebral Cortex Structure, Function, and Theory|year=1989|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Boston|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3402-5|first2=Asaf|last2=Keller|author3=Introduction by Thomas A. Woolsey}}</ref>\n\n==Function==\nSince neuropils have a diverse role in the nervous system, it is difficult to define a certain overarching function for all neuropils. For instance, the olfactory glomeruli function as sorts of way-stations for the information flowing from the [[olfactory receptor neuron]]s to the olfactory cortex. The inner plexiform layer of the retina is a little more complex. The [[bipolar cell]]s post-synaptic to either rods or cones are either depolarized or hyperpolarized depending on whether the bipolar cells have sign-inverting synapses or a sign-conserving synapses.<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\n===Efficiency in the brain===\nNeurons are necessary for all connections made in the brain, and thus can be thought of as the \"wires\" of the brain. As in computing, an entity is most efficient when its wires are optimized; therefore, a brain which has undergone millions of years of natural selection would be expected to have optimized neural circuitry. To have an optimized neural system it must balance four variables\u2014it must \"minimize conduction delays in axons, passive cable attenuation in dendrites, and the length of 'wire' used to construct circuits\" as well as \"maximize the density of synapses\",<ref name=\"Dmitri\">{{cite journal|first1=Dmitri B.|last1=Chklovskii|first2=Thomas|last2=Schikorski|first3=Charles F.|last3=Stevens|title=Wiring Optimization in Cortical Circuits|journal=Neuron|date=25 April 2002|volume=34|issue=3|pages=341\u2013347<!--|accessdate=20 April 2012-->|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00679-7}}</ref> essentially optimizing the neuropil. Researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory formulated the optimal balance of the four variables and calculated the optimal ratio of axon plus dendrite volume (i.e. the \"wire\" volume or neuropil volume) to total volume of grey matter. The formula predicted an optimal brain with 3/5 (60%) of its volume occupied by neuropil. Experimental evidence taken from three mouse brains agrees with this result.

These are all found in humans, with the exception of the barrel cortex, but many species have counterparts similar to our own regions of neuropil. However, the degree of similarity depends upon the composition of neuropil being compared. The concentrations of neuropil within certain regions are important to determine because simply using the proportions of the different postsynaptic elements does not verify the necessary, conclusive evidence. Comparing the concentrations can determine whether or not proportions of different postsynaptic elements contacted a particular axonal pathway. Relative concentrations could signify a reflection of different postsynaptic elements in the neuropil or show that axons sought out and formed synapses only with specific postsynaptic elements.<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book|last=White|first=Edward L.|title=Cortical Circuits Synaptic Organization of the Cerebral Cortex Structure, Function, and Theory|year=1989|publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Boston|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3402-5|first2=Asaf|last2=Keller|author3=Introduction by Thomas A. Woolsey}}</ref>\n\n==Function==\nSince neuropils have a diverse role in the nervous system, it is difficult to define a certain overarching function for all neuropils. For instance, the olfactory glomeruli function as sorts of way-stations for the information flowing from the [[olfactory receptor neuron]]s to the olfactory cortex. The inner plexiform layer of the retina is a little more complex. The [[bipolar cell]]s post-synaptic to either rods or cones are either depolarized or hyperpolarized depending on whether the bipolar cells have sign-inverting synapses or a sign-conserving synapses.<ref name=\"Purves\" />\n\n===Efficiency in the brain===\nNeurons are necessary for all connections made in the brain, and thus can be thought of as the \"wires\" of the brain. As in computing, an entity is most efficient when its wires are optimized; therefore, a brain which has undergone millions of years of natural selection would be expected to have optimized neural circuitry. To have an optimized neural system it must balance four variables\u2014it must \"minimize conduction delays in axons, passive cable attenuation in dendrites, and the length of 'wire' used to construct circuits\" as well as \"maximize the density of synapses\",<ref name=\"Dmitri\">{{cite journal|first1=Dmitri B.|last1=Chklovskii|first2=Thomas|last2=Schikorski|first3=Charles F.|last3=Stevens|title=Wiring Optimization in Cortical Circuits|journal=Neuron|date=25 April 2002|volume=34|issue=3|pages=341\u2013347<!--|accessdate=20 April 2012-->|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00679-7}}</ref> essentially optimizing the neuropil. Researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory formulated the optimal balance of the four variables and calculated the optimal ratio of axon plus dendrite volume (i.e. the \"wire\" volume or neuropil volume) to total volume of grey matter. The formula predicted an optimal brain with 3/5 (60%) of its volume occupied by neuropil. Experimental evidence taken from three mouse brains agrees with this result.
