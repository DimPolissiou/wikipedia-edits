In 1984, he also teamed with [[King Kong Bundy]] (also a hero at the time) to defeat [[The Road Warriors]] for the [[NWA National Tag Team Championship]] (which he had previously held with [[Scott Irwin|Super Destroyer]] in 1982) but was forced to give up the title due to injuries suffered in a mysterious assault (kayfabe). He was the first wrestler (along with Blackjack Mulligan) to have one-hour cage matches, then have a series of \"12\" ninety-minute cage matches against Mulligan.

Eadie was the primary mouthpiece of the team. The three Machines were introduced as rivals of [[Bobby Heenan]] and his massive tag team of [[Big John Studd]] and [[King Kong Bundy]].

Colley was later replaced by [[Barry Darsow]] as Smash, after it was discovered that too many people remembered Colley as Moondog Rex, the character he previously portrayed.

An allergic reaction to shellfish while in Japan after WrestleMania VI was the real cause of his temporary heart problem. Eadie confirmed this in a shoot interview in 2007. Before Eadie was medically cleared, Crush had been recruited as a temporary replacement.<ref name=Demolition/> Eadie's new position eventually fell through and his final WWF appearance was at [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series 1990]].<ref name=Demolition/> This event also marked the last time that he and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]] worked together for sixteen years.\n\nIn the midst of this time period, Eadie also played opposite Hulk Hogan as \"Jake Bullet\" in the movie ''[[No Holds Barred (1989 film)|No Holds Barred]]''.

Eadie would then go on to form a third Demolition team with partner Blast (Carmine Azzato). They competed on a few independent shows, then went their separate ways.\n\nEadie also competed on the Southern independent circuit as The Masked Superstar.

On March 28, 2009, Demolition Ax was inducted into the [[Keystone State Wrestling Alliance]] (KSWA) Hall of Fame in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In 1984, he also teamed with [[King Kong Bundy]] (also a hero at the time) to defeat [[The Road Warriors]] for the [[NWA National Tag Team Championship]] (which he had previously held with [[Scott Irwin|Super Destroyer]] in 1982) but was forced to give up the title due to injuries suffered in a mysterious assault (kayfabe). He was the first wrestler (along with Blackjack Mulligan) to have one-hour cage matches, then have a series of \"12\" ninety-minute cage matches against Mulligan.

Eadie was the primary mouthpiece of the team. The three Machines were introduced as rivals of [[Bobby Heenan]] and his massive tag team of [[Big John Studd]] and [[King Kong Bundy]]. ([[The Machines (professional wrestling)|The Machines]]' masks and gimmick were copied from [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] character \"[[Junji Hirata|Super Strong Machine]]\", played by Japanese wrestler [[Junji Hirata]]).<ref name=HOFHeels/> Eadie later dropped the Machine gimmick and left the WWF to head to [[Championship Wrestling from Florida|Florida]] for a run as the Masked Superstar, upending [[Lex Luger]] to win the NWA Southern title.<ref name=NWASouthern/>  He held the title for two weeks before Luger regained it.\n\nIn January 1987, Eadie returned to the WWF and formed the tag team [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] with [[Randy Colley]], formerly Moondog Rex, who wrestled as Smash while Eadie wrestled as Ax. Colley was later replaced by [[Barry Darsow]] as Smash, after it was discovered that too many people remembered Colley as Moondog Rex, the character he previously portrayed. Though they began as [[heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]s, their unique brawling style and charisma made them so popular that they became [[face (professional wrestling)|face]]s in November 1988.<ref name=Demolition>{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver | author2=Steve Johnson | last-author-amp=yes | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | chapter= The National era (1980s to present): Demolition | pages= 253\u2013255 | year=2005| isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}</ref> They won the [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] three times as a team of two, but lost the belts at [[SummerSlam (1990)|SummerSlam 1990]] after they reverted to being heels by forming a threesome with [[Brian Adams (wrestler)|Crush]].<ref name=WWFTag/> The trio concept was precipitated by a mutual decision to phase out the Ax character and for Eadie to take a backstage role in the company.<ref name=Demolition/> Popular rumor at the time cited heart problems on Eadie's part, which have been discredited in recent years. An allergic reaction to shellfish while in Japan after WrestleMania VI was the real cause of his temporary heart problem. Eadie confirmed this in a shoot interview in 2007. Before Eadie was medically cleared, Crush had been recruited as a temporary replacement.<ref name=Demolition/> Eadie's new position eventually fell through and his final WWF appearance was at [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series 1990]].<ref name=Demolition/> This event also marked the last time that he and [[Barry Darsow|Smash]] worked together for sixteen years.\n\nIn the midst of this time period, Eadie also played opposite Hulk Hogan as \"Jake Bullet\" in the movie ''[[No Holds Barred (1989 film)|No Holds Barred]]''.

Eadie would then go on to form a third Demolition team with partner Blast (Carmine Azzato). They competed on a few independent shows, then went their separate ways.\n\nEadie also competed on the Southern independent circuit as The Masked Superstar.

On March 28, 2009, Demolition Ax was inducted into the [[Keystone State Wrestling Alliance]] (KSWA) Hall of Fame in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

Street station''') is a major railway station in [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]], [[Melbourne]]. It is on [[Spencer Street, Melbourne|Spencer Street]], between [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins]] and [[La Trobe Street, Melbourne|La Trobe]] Streets, at the western edge of the [[Melbourne city centre|central business district]]. The [[Docklands Stadium]] sports arena is 500 metres north-west of the station.\n\nThe station is owned, operated and maintained by Infranexus (formerly known as AssetCo), a subsidiary of IFM Investors, under a 30-year lease to 2036 from the Victorian State Government, under a [[public-private partnership]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifminvestors.com/investment-capabilities/infrastructure/asset-portfolio |title=Southern Cross Station |accessdate=2016-10-04}}</ref><ref name=ppp/>\n\nThe station is the terminus of the [[List of regional railway stations in Victoria|state's regional railway network]] operated by [[V/Line]], ''[[The Overland]]'' rail service to [[Adelaide Parklands Terminal|Adelaide]], and [[New South Wales XPT|NSW TrainLink XPT]] services to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]]. It is also served by suburban rail services operated by [[Metro Trains Melbourne|Metro Trains]], being one of five stations on the [[City Loop]], a mostly underground railway that encircles the Central Business District. It is the second busiest railway station in Melbourne's metropolitan network, with 18.614 million passenger movements recorded in 2017/18.<ref name=\"patronage2013-2018\" /> This figure excludes V/Line passengers who use the station.\n\nSouthern Cross also has a coach terminal underneath the Spencer Outlet shopping complex.

It operated only at night, and only for freight trains. In the 1880s, it was proposed that Spencer Street station be removed in order to facilitate the westward expansion of the city, but the plan was subsequently rejected.\n\n\n===1880s: Passenger services commence===\nThe 1880s saw the first of several grand but unrealised plans for the station.  The first accepted design, drafted by Albert Charles Cook in 1883, was a fanciful [[Palazzo style architecture|Palladian palazzo]] design of two and three storeys, with a central portico.<ref>[http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/253560 Accepted Designs for the New Railway Stations, Melbourne.] State Library of Victoria</ref>\n\nFrom 1888 to 1894, the layout of the platforms was altered, with new country platforms being built on an angle to Spencer Street itself. The current coach terminal location was the site of a number of new platforms built for suburban services.<ref name=NewsrailAug03/>\n\nIn 1891, further plans were made for a significant new station complex, including three-storey office complex and dominant clock tower, reminiscent of the later [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]],<ref>[http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/252286 Official Design for New Station at Spencer Street]</ref> but the 1890s Depression put an end to such expensive schemes.\n\nIn 1888, work started on the double track [[Flinders Street Viaduct]] linking the station to Flinders Street station. The line was initially only used by freight trains, with passenger train operations commencing in 1894.<ref name=\"doi\">[http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/77A7B7BF57E705CDCA257234000CF29D?OpenDocument Department of Infrastructure: Early history of Southern Cross Station] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090604214153/http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/77A7B7BF57E705CDCA257234000CF29D?OpenDocument |date=4 June 2009 }}</ref> It was at that time that the first through platform was provided at the station, used by suburban trains from Essendon and Williamstown.<ref name=NewsrailNov02/> The viaduct to Flinders Street was expanded to four tracks in 1915,<ref name=\"doi\" /> and, in conjunction with the [[railway electrification system|electrification]] works on the [[Railways in Melbourne|suburban network]], today's platforms 11 to 14 were opened between 1918 and 1924, along with a pedestrian subway providing access to them.<ref name=NewsrailNov02/>\n\nIn 1938, it was announced that construction of an improved station entrance and new car park had been approved, designed by architects Messrs Stephenson and Meldrum, costing \u00a32,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Spencer Street Improved Station \u00a32,000 Plan Adopted|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/11146267|accessdate=2013-05-31|newspaper=The Argus|date=1938-02-05}}</ref> Once again however, no construction took place.\n\n===1960s: Modernisation===\nIn October 1960 work on a new Spencer Street station commenced, sparked by the construction of the interstate standard gauge line to [[Sydney]].<ref name=NewsrailNov02/> A station building was constructed which largely replaced the 1880s iron sheds, and a new {{convert|413|m|ft|adj=on}} platform number 1 was built. The passenger subway which had been constructed as part of the 1918 works was extended to include access to country platforms.<ref name=NewsrailNov02/> In connection with the construction of the [[City Loop|underground loop]], platforms 9 and 10 were rebuilt as part of the suburban section of the station, and a new double-track viaduct was constructed between Spencer Street and Flinders Street station, alongside the original one, bringing to six the number of tracks connecting the two stations.  At the same time, the four older tracks were resignalled for bi-directional operation.\n\nIn 1962 a separate subway network was constructed to carry mail between the station and what was then the [[Melbourne General Post Office]] and main postal sorting office, situated on the other side of Spencer Street.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spencer Street Subway|url=http://www.walkingmelbourne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=7238|publisher=Walking Melbourne|accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Interlocking|mechanically interlocked]] [[signal box]] at the station opened in 1887,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22100874-2862,00.html |title=Signal box concerns | work=Herald Sun  |publisher=News |accessdate=2008-06-07 | first=Mike | last=Edmonds | date=2007-07-20}}</ref> and was decommissioned in June 2008.

The central features of the design include a wave-shaped roof, a new entrance and concourse on Collins Street, a new coach interchange, a new food court, a bar/restaurant, separate retail outlets inside the station and a separate shopping complex between [[Bourke Street, Melbourne|Bourke]] and [[La Trobe Street, Melbourne|La Trobe]] Streets.\n\nThis new shopping complex originally comprised a [[Direct Factory Outlets]] centre, a [[Virgin Megastore]], along with food courts. This opened on 30 November 2006, although not all tenancies were occupied, and stage 2 was opened in March 2007. In 2009 the DFO relocated to a new site at South Wharf, the shopping centre being refitted by owner [[Austexx]] and rebranded simply as \"Spencer Street fashion station\".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.realestatesource.com.au/dfo-south-wharf-melbourne-to-open-october-15.html|title=DFO South Wharf, Melbourne to Open October 15|author=Marc Pallisco|date=3 October 2009|work=realestatesource.com.au|accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> In 2013 the shopping complex was rebranded as \"Spencer Outlet Centre\".\n\nIn addition to the physical modifications, the station was renamed from Spencer Street to Southern Cross on 13 December 2005.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/times-up-at-last-for-railway-landmark/2005/12/13/1134236064367.html Time's up at last for railway landmark] ''The Age'' 14 December 2005</ref>\n\nBy July 2004 the project had fallen behind schedule and over budget by $200 million.<ref>[http://www.audit.vic.gov.au/reports_finance/06afrcv.html Auditor-General\u2019s Report on the Annual Financial Report of the State of Victoria, 2005\u201306] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302025525/http://www.audit.vic.gov.au/reports_finance/06afrcv.html |date=2 March 2007 }}</ref> This was covered extensively in the media. As a result of over-runs and design issues, some elements of the original design, including an additional proposed footbridge connecting [[Lonsdale Street, Melbourne|Lonsdale Street]] with [[Docklands Stadium]], were scrapped.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/07/08/1120704557967.html All change at Spencer St] ''The Age'' 9 July 2005]</ref>\n\nComplaints about access to platforms, empty trains occupying space during the day and lack of government support were raised by [[Leighton Contractors]], the construction firm overseeing the project. This led to concerns that the station might not be ready in time for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]], and the government arranged with the railway operators to provide more access to the work site.\n\nThe station's redevelopment is part of the wider [[Melbourne Docklands]] development. The architect responsible for the design is [[Nicholas Grimshaw]]. The structural engineering design was performed by [[WSP Global]]. The station has been awarded the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]' Lubetkin Prize for most outstanding building outside the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southern Cross Station in Melbourne Wins Prestigious International Architecture Award|date=22 June 2007|url=http://www.architecture.com/NewsAndPress/News/AwardsNews/Press/2007/SouthernCrossStation.aspx|accessdate=23 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608160920/http://www.architecture.com/NewsAndPress/News/AwardsNews/Press/2007/SouthernCrossStation.aspx|archivedate=8 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The other buildings nominated were the Des Moines Public Library and the [[Hearst Tower (New York City)|Hearst Tower]], New York City.<ref>{{cite web|title=Revamped Melbourne station wins international award |publisher=ABC News Online|date =2007-06-23|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/23/1959848.htm|accessdate =2007-06-23}}</ref>\n\nThe redevelopment has meant that passengers take more time to get to the suburban network platforms than before. The pedestrian subway access was removed in favour of street level and elevated concourses. The subway also continued underneath Spencer Street, and its closure means it is necessary for all pedestrians to wait for traffic lights to cross Spencer Street at street level. For all suburban and some country services, passengers using the main entrance on the corner of Collins and Spencer Streets have to ascend two escalators to a shopping concourse and then enter the paid area of the station, before descending again to the metropolitan platforms. There have been some accidents in which people have fallen from this elevated level.<ref>{{cite news|title=Man critical after horror fall from escalator at Southern Cross|date=14 July 2010|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/man-critical-after-horror-fall-from-escalator-at-southern-cross-20100714-10agk.html|accessdate=12 April 2011|location=Melbourne|work=The Age}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Woman badly hurt in station fall|date=25 June 2010|url =http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/woman-badly-hurt-in-station-fall-20100624-z3iz.html|accessdate=12 April 2011|location=Melbourne|work=The Age}}</ref> The eight-meter ascent and descent is more than necessary to clear the height of trains, and more than the three-meter descent and ascent of the previous subway.\n\nLocal architects have cited some of the Southern Cross Station's shortcomings: the building's poor connection to the surrounding streets; its awkward juncture at the pedestrian bridge that links Spencer Street to Docklands Stadium; and the baffling manner in which the grand architectural gesture of Southern Cross Station tapers off into an uninspired homage to the boxy 1980s shopping mall \u2014 Spencer Outlet Centre, which houses department store [[Harris Scarfe]] along with [[Witchery (company)|Witchery]], [[Cotton On]], [[Starbucks]] and many more outlets.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/stations-curves-prove-real-headturner/2007/07/13/1183833774723.html?page=fullpage | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Station's curves prove real head-turner | date=14 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n===2010s: Additional platforms===\nAs part of the [[Regional Rail Link]] program an extra two platforms (15/16) were constructed and opened in December 2013. These are divided into 15a, 15b, 16a and 16b. They are often used for Gippsland Services, And the lines that use the RRL tracks to Sunshine (Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo lines). These platforms allow trains to avoid the North Melbourne Flyover, which is an inconvenience for trains as it has a maximum speed of 15&nbsp;km/h, and has shown to cause abnormal wheel wear on Vlocities.\n\n===Water Tower Clock===\nIn May 2014, the historic Water Tower Clock was installed in the concourse of the station.<ref>{{cite news|title=Melbourne\u2019s 130-year-old Water Tower Clock back at Southern Cross station|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/inner-east/melbournes-130yearold-water-tower-clock-back-at-southern-cross-station/story-fngnvlpt-1226918693985|accessdate=2015-03-02|work=Melbourne Leader|date=2014-05-15}}</ref> The clock had originally been erected in 1882 at Flinders Street station, opposite the end of Elizabeth Street, atop a lattice tower about {{convert|60|ft|m}} high. In 1902 the clock was moved to [[Princes Bridge railway station|Princes Bridge station]], and in 1910 it was relocated again, to Spencer Street station, where it remained until it was removed as part of the station's redevelopment in the mid-1960s. The clock mechanism was given to [[Museum Victoria]], but the characteristic turret that housed the clock was sold to a scrap metal merchant. It was later rescued by private collectors, and the clock was returned to public ownership, being put on display in 1999 at the [[Scienceworks Museum (Melbourne)|Scienceworks Museum]], [[Spotswood, Victoria|Spotswood]]. The clock was extensively restored before its return to Southern Cross, but the original mechanism remains in the collection of Museum Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old clock\u2019s time to shine|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/about/media-centre/news/december-2013/old-clock/|publisher=Museum Victoria|accessdate=2015-03-02}}</ref><ref>\"Water Tower clock installed at Southern Cross Station\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' July 2014 page 23</ref>\n\n==Platforms and services==\n[[File:Southern Cross Station.jpg|thumb|Overlooking platforms 8, 7 & 6]]\n[[File:Southerncross1.jpg|thumb|Overlooking platforms 9 & 10]]\n[[File:Southern Cross Station - Northern Platforms.jpg|thumb|The northern (\"B\") platforms as seen from the Bourke Street footbridge.

Platform 1 is north of Bourke Street, while Platform 8 South is south of Collins Street. The remainder of platforms are located between Bourke and Collins Streets, with access from both concourses. Both concourses are further divided into an open access regional section for platforms 1 though 8, and a closed access suburban section for platforms 9 though 14.\n\n===Platforms===\n[[File:Southern Cross Platform 15 16 Concourse.JPG|thumb|Platform 15-16 Northern Concourse]]\n[[File:Southern Cross Suburban.JPG|thumb|Interior of Southern Cross station in rush hour]]\nPlatforms 2 to 7, as well as platforms 15 and 16 are numbered as two sections: section A from the Collins Street concourse to the Bourke Street Footbridge, and section B beyond the Bourke Street Footbridge. These sections were previously known as the \"Central\" (2C to 8C) and \"North\" (2N to 8N) platforms, respectively. Platform 8 has these two sections and also a \"South\" section (8S) underneath Collins Street. Used commonly for Seymour Services\n\nPlatforms 1 and 2 are fitted with [[dual gauge]] track, permitting both [[standard gauge]] interstate trains and V/Line [[Victorian broad gauge|broad gauge]] trains. The remainder of the platforms are solely broad gauge. A [[motorail]] dock is located at the northern end of the platform, with standard gauge access only.\n\n====Standard gauge====\n'''Platforms 1 & 2:'''\n*{{RouteBox|Albury line|Albury V/Line rail

Street station''') is a major railway station in [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]], [[Melbourne]]. It is on [[Spencer Street, Melbourne|Spencer Street]], between [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins]] and [[La Trobe Street, Melbourne|La Trobe]] Streets, at the western edge of the [[Melbourne city centre|central business district]]. The [[Docklands Stadium]] sports arena is 500 metres north-west of the station.\n\nThe station is owned, operated and maintained by Infranexus (formerly known as AssetCo), a subsidiary of IFM Investors, under a 30-year lease to 2036 from the Victorian State Government, under a [[public-private partnership]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifminvestors.com/investment-capabilities/infrastructure/asset-portfolio |title=Southern Cross Station |accessdate=2016-10-04}}</ref><ref name=ppp/>\n\nThe station is the terminus of the [[List of regional railway stations in Victoria|state's regional railway network]] operated by [[V/Line]], ''[[The Overland]]'' rail service to [[Adelaide Parklands Terminal|Adelaide]], and [[New South Wales XPT|NSW TrainLink XPT]] services to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney]]. It is also served by suburban rail services operated by [[Metro Trains Melbourne|Metro Trains]], being one of five stations on the [[City Loop]], a mostly underground railway that encircles the Central Business District. It is the second busiest railway station in Melbourne's metropolitan network, with 18.614 million passenger movements recorded in 2017/18.<ref name=\"patronage2013-2018\" /> This figure excludes V/Line passengers who use the station.\n\nSouthern Cross also has a coach terminal underneath the Spencer Outlet shopping complex.

It operated only at night, and only for freight trains. In the 1880s, it was proposed that Spencer Street station be removed in order to facilitate the westward expansion of the city, but the plan was subsequently rejected.\n\n\n===1880s: Passenger services commence===\nThe 1880s saw the first of several grand but unrealised plans for the station.  The first accepted design, drafted by Albert Charles Cook in 1883, was a fanciful Palladian palazzo design of two and three storeys, with central portico.<ref>[http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/253560 Accepted Designs for the New Railway Stations, Melbourne.] State Library of Victoria</ref>\n\nFrom 1888 to 1894 the layout of the platforms was altered, with new country platforms being built on an angle to Spencer Street itself. The current coach terminal location was the site of a number of new platforms built for suburban services.<ref name=NewsrailAug03/>\n\nIn 1891, further plans were made for a significant new station complex, including three-storey office complex and dominant clock tower reminiscent of the later [[Central railway station, Sydney|Sydney Central station]],<ref>[http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/252286 Official Design for New Station at Spencer Street]</ref> but the 1890s Depression put an end to such expensive schemes.\n\nIn 1888 work started on the double track [[Flinders Street Viaduct]] linking the station to Flinders Street station. The line was initially only used by freight trains, with passenger train operations commencing in 1894.<ref name=\"doi\">[http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/77A7B7BF57E705CDCA257234000CF29D?OpenDocument Department of Infrastructure: Early history of Southern Cross Station] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090604214153/http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/77A7B7BF57E705CDCA257234000CF29D?OpenDocument |date=4 June 2009 }}</ref> It was at this time that the first through platform was provided at the station, for suburban trains from Essendon and Williamstown.<ref name=NewsrailNov02/> The viaduct to Flinders Street was expanded to four tracks in 1915,<ref name=\"doi\" /> and in conjunction with the [[railway electrification system|electrification]] works on the [[Railways in Melbourne|suburban network]] today's platforms 11 to 14 were opened between 1918 and 1924, along with a pedestrian subway providing access to them.<ref name=NewsrailNov02/>\n\nIn 1938 it was announced that construction of an improved station entrance and new car park had been approved, at a cost of \u00a32,000, designed by architects Messrs Stephenson and Meldrum.<ref>{{cite news|title=Spencer Street Improved Station \u00a32,000 Plan Adopted|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article11146267/585566|accessdate=2013-05-31|newspaper=The Argus|date=1938-02-05}}</ref> Once again however, no construction took place..\n\n===1960s: Modernisation===\nIn October 1960 work on a new Spencer Street station commenced, sparked by the construction of the interstate standard gauge line to [[Sydney]].<ref name=NewsrailNov02/> A station building was constructed which largely replaced the 1880s iron sheds, and a new {{convert|413|m|ft|adj=on}} platform number 1 was built. The passenger subway which had been constructed as part of the 1918 works was extended to include access to country platforms.<ref name=NewsrailNov02/> In connection with the construction of the [[City Loop|underground loop]], platforms 9 and 10 were rebuilt as part of the suburban section of the station, and a new double-track viaduct was constructed between Spencer Street and Flinders Street station, alongside the original one, bringing to six the number of tracks connecting the two stations.  At the same time, the four older tracks were resignalled for bi-directional operation.\n\nIn 1962 a separate subway network was constructed to carry mail between the station and what was then the [[Melbourne General Post Office]] and main postal sorting office, situated on the other side of Spencer Street.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spencer Street Subway|url=http://www.walkingmelbourne.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=7238|publisher=Walking Melbourne|accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Interlocking|mechanically interlocked]] [[signal box]] at the station opened in 1887,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22100874-2862,00.html |title=Signal box concerns | work=Herald Sun  |publisher=News |accessdate=2008-06-07 | first=Mike | last=Edmonds | date=2007-07-20}}</ref> and was decommissioned in June 2008.

The central features of the design include a wave-shaped roof, a new entrance and concourse on Collins Street, a new coach interchange, a new food court, a bar/restaurant, separate retail outlets inside the station and a separate shopping complex between [[Bourke Street, Melbourne|Bourke]] and [[La Trobe Street, Melbourne|La Trobe]] Streets.\n\nThis new shopping complex originally comprised a [[Direct Factory Outlets]] centre, a [[Virgin Megastore]], along with food courts. This opened on 30 November 2006, although not all tenancies were occupied, and stage 2 was opened in March 2007. In 2009 the DFO relocated to a new site at South Wharf, the shopping centre being refitted by owner [[Austexx]] and rebranded simply as \"Spencer Street fashion station\".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.realestatesource.com.au/dfo-south-wharf-melbourne-to-open-october-15.html|title=DFO South Wharf, Melbourne to Open October 15|author=Marc Pallisco|date=3 October 2009|work=realestatesource.com.au|accessdate=10 May 2010}}</ref> In 2013 the shopping complex was rebranded as \"Spencer Outlet Centre\".\n\nIn addition to the physical modifications, the station was renamed from Spencer Street to Southern Cross on 13 December 2005.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/times-up-at-last-for-railway-landmark/2005/12/13/1134236064367.html Time's up at last for railway landmark] ''The Age'' 14 December 2005</ref>\n\nBy July 2004 the project had fallen behind schedule and over budget by $200 million.<ref>[http://www.audit.vic.gov.au/reports_finance/06afrcv.html Auditor-General\u2019s Report on the Annual Financial Report of the State of Victoria, 2005\u201306] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302025525/http://www.audit.vic.gov.au/reports_finance/06afrcv.html |date=2 March 2007 }}</ref> This was covered extensively in the media. As a result of over-runs and design issues, some elements of the original design, including an additional proposed footbridge connecting [[Lonsdale Street, Melbourne|Lonsdale Street]] with [[Docklands Stadium]], were scrapped.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2005/07/08/1120704557967.html All change at Spencer St] ''The Age'' 9 July 2005]</ref>\n\nComplaints about access to platforms, empty trains occupying space during the day and lack of government support were raised by [[Leighton Contractors]], the construction firm overseeing the project. This led to concerns that the station might not be ready in time for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth Games]], and the government arranged with the railway operators to provide more access to the work site.\n\nThe station's redevelopment is part of the wider [[Melbourne Docklands]] development. The architect responsible for the design is [[Nicholas Grimshaw]]. The structural engineering design was performed by [[WSP Global]]. The station has been awarded the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]' Lubetkin Prize for most outstanding building outside the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southern Cross Station in Melbourne Wins Prestigious International Architecture Award|date=22 June 2007|url=http://www.architecture.com/NewsAndPress/News/AwardsNews/Press/2007/SouthernCrossStation.aspx|accessdate=23 December 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608160920/http://www.architecture.com/NewsAndPress/News/AwardsNews/Press/2007/SouthernCrossStation.aspx|archivedate=8 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The other buildings nominated were the Des Moines Public Library and the [[Hearst Tower (New York City)|Hearst Tower]], New York City.<ref>{{cite web|title=Revamped Melbourne station wins international award |publisher=ABC News Online|date =2007-06-23|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/23/1959848.htm|accessdate =2007-06-23}}</ref>\n\nThe redevelopment has meant that passengers take more time to get to the suburban network platforms than before. The pedestrian subway access was removed in favour of street level and elevated concourses. The subway also continued underneath Spencer Street, and its closure means it is necessary for all pedestrians to wait for traffic lights to cross Spencer Street at street level. For all suburban and some country services, passengers using the main entrance on the corner of Collins and Spencer Streets have to ascend two escalators to a shopping concourse and then enter the paid area of the station, before descending again to the metropolitan platforms. There have been some accidents in which people have fallen from this elevated level.<ref>{{cite news|title=Man critical after horror fall from escalator at Southern Cross|date=14 July 2010|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/man-critical-after-horror-fall-from-escalator-at-southern-cross-20100714-10agk.html|accessdate=12 April 2011|location=Melbourne|work=The Age}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Woman badly hurt in station fall|date=25 June 2010|url =http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/woman-badly-hurt-in-station-fall-20100624-z3iz.html|accessdate=12 April 2011|location=Melbourne|work=The Age}}</ref> The eight-meter ascent and descent is more than necessary to clear the height of trains, and more than the three-meter descent and ascent of the previous subway.\n\nLocal architects have cited some of the Southern Cross Station's shortcomings: the building's poor connection to the surrounding streets; its awkward juncture at the pedestrian bridge that links Spencer Street to Docklands Stadium; and the baffling manner in which the grand architectural gesture of Southern Cross Station tapers off into an uninspired homage to the boxy 1980s shopping mall \u2014 Spencer Outlet Centre, which houses department store [[Harris Scarfe]] along with [[Witchery (company)|Witchery]], [[Cotton On]], [[Starbucks]] and many more outlets.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/stations-curves-prove-real-headturner/2007/07/13/1183833774723.html?page=fullpage | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Station's curves prove real head-turner | date=14 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n===2010s: Additional platforms===\nAs part of the [[Regional Rail Link]] program an extra two platforms (15/16) were constructed and opened in December 2013. These are divided into 15a, 15b, 16a and 16b. They are often used for Gippsland Services, And the lines that use the RRL tracks to Sunshine (Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo lines). These platforms allow trains to avoid the North Melbourne Flyover, which is an inconvenience for trains as it has a maximum speed of 15&nbsp;km/h, and has shown to cause abnormal wheel wear on Vlocities.\n\n===Water Tower Clock===\nIn May 2014, the historic Water Tower Clock was installed in the concourse of the station.<ref>{{cite news|title=Melbourne\u2019s 130-year-old Water Tower Clock back at Southern Cross station|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/inner-east/melbournes-130yearold-water-tower-clock-back-at-southern-cross-station/story-fngnvlpt-1226918693985|accessdate=2015-03-02|work=Melbourne Leader|date=2014-05-15}}</ref> The clock had originally been erected in 1882 at Flinders Street station, opposite the end of Elizabeth Street, atop a lattice tower about {{convert|60|ft|m}} high. In 1902 the clock was moved to [[Princes Bridge railway station|Princes Bridge station]], and in 1910 it was relocated again, to Spencer Street station, where it remained until it was removed as part of the station's redevelopment in the mid-1960s. The clock mechanism was given to [[Museum Victoria]], but the characteristic turret that housed the clock was sold to a scrap metal merchant. It was later rescued by private collectors, and the clock was returned to public ownership, being put on display in 1999 at the [[Scienceworks Museum (Melbourne)|Scienceworks Museum]], [[Spotswood, Victoria|Spotswood]]. The clock was extensively restored before its return to Southern Cross, but the original mechanism remains in the collection of Museum Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|title=Old clock\u2019s time to shine|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/about/media-centre/news/december-2013/old-clock/|publisher=Museum Victoria|accessdate=2015-03-02}}</ref><ref>\"Water Tower clock installed at Southern Cross Station\" ''[[Railway Digest]]'' July 2014 page 23</ref>\n\n==Platforms and services==\n[[File:Southern Cross Station.jpg|thumb|Overlooking platforms 8, 7 & 6]]\n[[File:Southerncross1.jpg|thumb|Overlooking platforms 9 & 10]]\n[[File:Southern Cross Station - Northern Platforms.jpg|thumb|The northern (\"B\") platforms as seen from the Bourke Street footbridge.

Platform 1 is north of Bourke Street, while Platform 8 South is south of Collins Street. The remainder of platforms are located between Bourke and Collins Streets, with access from both concourses. Both concourses are further divided into an open access regional section for platforms 1 though 8, and a closed access suburban section for platforms 9 though 14.\n\n===Platforms===\n[[File:Southern Cross Platform 15 16 Concourse.JPG|thumb|Platform 15-16 Northern Concourse]]\n[[File:Southern Cross Suburban.JPG|thumb|Interior of Southern Cross station in rush hour]]\nPlatforms 2 to 7, as well as platforms 15 and 16 are numbered as two sections: section A from the Collins Street concourse to the Bourke Street Footbridge, and section B beyond the Bourke Street Footbridge. These sections were previously known as the \"Central\" (2C to 8C) and \"North\" (2N to 8N) platforms, respectively. Platform 8 has these two sections and also a \"South\" section (8S) underneath Collins Street. Used commonly for Seymour Services\n\nPlatforms 1 and 2 are fitted with [[dual gauge]] track, permitting both [[standard gauge]] interstate trains and V/Line [[Victorian broad gauge|broad gauge]] trains.
