At that point a response of \"I do\" or \"I swear\" completes the oath.

The error was picked up by schoolgirl Helen Terwilliger on the radio. Taft eventually acknowledged his error, but did not think it was important, and Hoover did not retake the oath. In Taft's view, his departure from the text did not invalidate the oath.<ref name = Time1929 /><ref>{{cite web|author=Agence France-Presse |url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/world/01/21/09/chief-justice-leads-obama-stumble-presidential-oath |title=Chief justice leads Obama to stumble presidential oath  |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://legaltimes.typepad.com/blt/2009/01/no-problems-with-todays-oath-at-the-supreme-court.html |title=No Problems With Today's Oath at the Supreme Court \u2013 The BLT: The Blog of Legal Times |publisher=Legaltimes.typepad.com |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2010-08-07}}</ref>\n* In 1945, President [[Harry S.

Roberts prompted, \"That I will execute the Office of President ''to'' the United States ''faithfully''.\" Obama stopped at \"execute,\" and waited for Roberts to correct himself.

With the 2017 inauguration of [[Donald Trump]], the presidential oath has been taken 75 different times by 44<!-- DO NOT change this number; forty-four (44) is CURRENT and CORRECT. While the incumbent president, Donald Trump, is the nation's 45th president, he is only the 44th person to serve as president. This is because Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is numbered as both the 22nd and 24th U.S. president. Thank you. -->  persons. This numerical discrepancy results chiefly from two factors: a president must take the oath at the beginning of each term of office, and, because Inauguration Day has sometimes fallen on a Sunday, five presidents have taken the oath privately before the public inauguration ceremony. In addition, three have repeated the oath as a precaution against potential later constitutional challenges.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/inauguration-us-capitol| title=Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol| publisher=Architect of the Capitol| access-date=January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

M. Milligan (a Presbyterian minister who advocated for an official Christian U.S. government) that letters were sent to Abraham Lincoln asking him to swear to God during his inaugurations, and Lincoln allegedly wrote back saying that God's name was not in the Constitution, and he could not depart from the letter of that instrument.<ref>{{cite book|last = Foster|first = James Mitchell|title = Christ the King|origyear = 1894|url = https://archive.org/details/christking00fostgoog|publisher = James H.

The mistake was similar to the one Taft himself would make twenty years later when swearing in President Hoover. Recalling the incident, Taft wrote, \"When I was sworn in as president by Chief Justice Fuller, he made a similar slip,\" and added, \"but in those days when there was no radio, it was observed only in the Senate chamber where I took the oath.\"<ref name = Time1929>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,846311,00.html Time Magazine], Mar. 25, 1929].

The error was picked up by schoolgirl Helen Terwilliger on the radio. Taft eventually acknowledged his error, but did not think it was important, and Hoover did not retake the oath.

With the 2017 inauguration of [[Donald Trump]], the presidential oath has been taken 75 different times by 44<!-- DO NOT change this number; forty-four (44) is CURRENT and CORRECT. While the incumbent president, Donald Trump, is the nation's 45th president, he is only the 44th person to serve as president. This is because Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms and is numbered as both the 22nd and 24th U.S. president. Thank you. -->  persons. This numerical discrepancy results chiefly from two factors: a president must take the oath at the beginning of each term of office, and, because Inauguration Day has sometimes fallen on a Sunday, five presidents have taken the oath privately before the public inauguration ceremony. In addition, three have repeated the oath as a precaution against potential later constitutional challenges.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/inauguration-us-capitol| title=Inauguration at the U.S. Capitol| publisher=Architect of the Capitol| access-date=January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Born in [[Clifton, Bristol]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1894, and travelled to the [[Transvaal Colony]] where, as a member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]], he became Director of Education. Ware next became editor of the [[The Morning Post|''Morning Post'']], being fired in 1911 after several controversies.\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the [[British Army]] but was rejected because he was too old. With the assistance of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], he obtained command of a mobile [[ambulance]] unit provided by the [[British Red Cross Society]]. In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. Ware and his graves' registration organization were transferred to the [[British Army]] in 1915. This was to become the Imperial War Graves Commission. Ware ended the war as a major general, having been [[mentioned in despatches]] twice and continued to work with the commission. In [[World War II]], he was appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries. He fully retired in 1948, and died the following year.\n==Early life==\nWare was born in [[Clifton, Bristol]] on 17 June 1869,<ref name=\"Veterans Agency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|title=Major General Sir Fabian Ware|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Veterans Agency|Ministry of Defence Veterans Agency]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112162637/http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|archive-date=12 November 2014|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref> to Charles Ware, a chartered accountant, and his wife, Amy Carew, {{Nee}} Goulstone.<ref name= \"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB|title=Ware, Sir Fabian Arthur Goulstone|id=3674|ref=harv|date=2008|first=A.

He became the representative of the Education Committee of the Royal British Commission at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1900 in [[Paris]]. After the exhibition, Ware worked as an inspector of schools for the [[Board of education|Board of Education]].{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=17}} He then became a member of a group of young Britons later known as [[Viscount Milner]]'s [[Milner's Kindergarten|kindergarten]]{{Sfn|Stamp|2010|p=72}} and in October 1901 was appointed assistant director of education in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]].{{Sfn|Worsfold|1913|p=79}} On 5 July 1902, [[Edmund Beale Sargant]], director of education for the Transvaal, wrote a letter to the [[Council of Education, Witwatersrand]], requesting their cooperation in selecting a committee regarding technical education. A committee was then formed, with Ware as the chairman. It recommended the establishment of a technical institute.{{Sfn|South African School of Mines and Technology|1910|pp=1\u20134}} In late 1902, the report on a technical institute  reached the [[Lieutenant Governor]] of the Transvaal who in January 1903 created a second \"Technical Education Commission\" again with Ware as a member.

The commission represented a joint effort between the British Army and British Red Cross.{{Efn|Crane writes that \"in some ways the GRC remained a curious hybrid, semi-detached sort of unit - the Red Cross continued to supply men and vehicles, while Ware was given the local rank of major... and the army took on the costs of crosses, rations and fuel\" {{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=52}}|name=|group=}}{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=50\u201352}} On 22 May, he was made a temporary [[major]] in the British Army.{{Sfn|The London Gazette 21 May 1915}} On 9 September, the promotion was [[antedated]] to 22 February 1915.{{Sfn|The London Gazette 7 September 1915}} \n\nWare's work continued to expand: by May 1915, 4,300 graves had been registered. He was extensively involved in early organization of the commission, dividing it into two main parts and seven sections. That spring he began serving as an intermediary between the French and British governments over grave-related matters. The organization began handling requests at a headquarters in [[Lillers]], and the sections worked on grave maintenance. The organization was soon exempted from a ban on [[War photography|photography]] and a department of three photographers was created to photograph graves; by mid-August, six thousand graves had been photographed and eight hundred photographs sent to families. A further 18,173 graves had been registered. Around the same time Ware became unable to continue work with the Mobile Ambulance Unit, and began to solely focus on the commission. On 6 September Macready recommended transferring the organization completely to the Army; the transfer was completed by late October.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=50\u201352, 54\u201356, 59}}  \n\nIn his role in the commission, wares served as \"the sole [[intermediary]] between the British Army in the Field and the French Military and Civil Authorities in all matters relating to graves.\"{{Sfn|War Graves|1929|p=15}} Throughout 1915 and 1916, Ware led negotiations between France and Britain, resolving various issues, particularly that of [[land expropriation]]. Around June 1915, his efforts resulted in an 'expropriation bill' that began to be debated by the French government. Ware shepherded the bill through its passage, urging prominent figures such as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant-General]], the [[King of the United Kingdom|King]], and the editor of the ''Times'' to support it.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=59, 64}} The law passed the French government on 29 December 1917.{{Sfn|NYS Assembly|1918|p=548}} It gave Britain the ability to control their war graves in \"perpetuity of [[sepulture]]\"{{Sfn|Miles|2017|p=51}} and provided for the establishment of a British authority to manage the cemeteries.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=65}} \n\nWhen [[William Glynne Charles Gladstone]], a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] and the grandson of former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], was [[killed in action]] near [[Laventie]] on 13 April 1915, his family attempted to have the body [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and returned to England. Despite a ban on exhumations established by [[Joseph Joffre]], his family received special permission to take the body and bury it in [[Hawarden|Hawarden, Wales]].

For example, [[Lionel Earle]], a member of the International War Graves Committee, objected to the Army's practice of marking the graves of [[deserters]] with unmarked wooden crosses. As a result the custom was abolished. In 1916, efforts to neaten the cemeteries began. Ware invited [[Arthur William Hill]], then assistant director of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], to tour the cemeteries and advise upon further planting efforts in early 1915.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=88\u201389}} In the [[1917 New Year Honours]], Ware was awarded the [[Companion Order of St Michael and St George]].{{Sfn|The Edinburgh Gazette 26 January 1917}} \n\n=== Imperial War Graves Commission ===\n[[File:Canadian Corps - Canadian war graves.jpg|thumb|Canadian war graves near [[Ypres, Belgium]].

Born in [[Clifton, Bristol]], he graduated from the [[University of Paris]] in 1894, and travelled to the [[Transvaal Colony]] where, as a member of [[Milner's Kindergarten]], he became Director of Education. Ware next became editor of the [[The Morning Post|''Morning Post'']], being fired in 1911 after several controversies.\n\nWhen the [[First World War]] started in August 1914, Ware attempted to join the [[British Army]] but was rejected because he was too old. With the assistance of [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Lord Milner]], he obtained command of a mobile [[ambulance]] unit provided by the [[British Red Cross Society]]. In this role he began marking and recording the graves of those killed. Ware and his graves' registration organization were transferred to the [[British Army]] in 1915. This was to become the Imperial War Graves Commission. Ware ended the war as a major general, having been [[mentioned in despatches]] twice and continued to work with the commission. In [[World War II]], he was appointed director-general of Graves Registration and Enquiries. He fully retired in 1948, and died the following year.\n==Early life==\nWare was born in [[Clifton, Bristol]] on 17 June 1869,<ref name=\"Veterans Agency\">{{cite web|url=http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|title=Major General Sir Fabian Ware|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Veterans Agency|Ministry of Defence Veterans Agency]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112162637/http://www.veterans-uk.info/remembrance/ware.html|archive-date=12 November 2014|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref> to Charles Ware, a chartered accountant, and his wife, Amy Carew, {{Nee}} Goulstone.<ref name= \"ODNB\">{{cite ODNB|title=Ware, Sir Fabian Arthur Goulstone|id=3674|ref=harv|date=2008|first=A.

He became the representative of the Education Committee of the Royal British Commission at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] of 1900 in [[Paris]]. After the exhibition, Ware worked as an inspector of schools for the [[Board of education|Board of Education]].{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=17}} He then became a member of a group of young Britons later known as [[Viscount Milner]]'s [[Milner's Kindergarten|kindergarten]]{{Sfn|Stamp|2010|p=72}} and in October 1901 was appointed assistant director of education in the [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]].{{Sfn|Worsfold|1913|p=79}} On 5 July 1902, [[Edmund Beale Sargant]], director of education for the Transvaal, wrote a letter to the [[Council of Education, Witwatersrand]], requesting their cooperation in selecting a committee regarding technical education. A committee was then formed, with Ware as the chairman. It recommended the establishment of a technical institute.{{Sfn|South African School of Mines and Technology|1910|pp=1\u20134}} In late 1902, the report on a technical institute  reached the [[Lieutenant Governor]] of the Transvaal who in January 1903 created a second \"Technical Education Commission\" again with Ware as a member. They again recommended a technical institute, and as a result the [[Transvaal Technical Institute]] was created with Ware as the chairman of the Institute's council.{{Sfn|South African School of Mines and Technology|1910|pp=1\u20134|p=}}{{Sfn|Page|1904|p=627}}\n\nIn early 1903 he became acting director of education when Sargant, in failing health, returned to England,<ref name= \"ODNB\"/>{{Sfn|Worsfold|1913|p=81}} and in July was made permanent director.{{Sfn|Worsfold|1913|p=84}}{{sfn|Malherbe|1925|p=305}} On 17 June 1903 he was made a member of the Transvaal Legislative Council.{{Sfn|The Edinburgh Gazette 23 June 1903}} Under Ware, the number of children in education in the Transvaal doubled in less than four years.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=21}} As director, he advocated a de-centralized system of education with responsibility largely in the hands of local authorities.{{sfn|Malherbe|1925|pp=305, 326}}\n\nIn 1905, he was offered the editorship of the ''Morning Post.'' He accepted, and moved back to England.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=22\u201326}} Ware aimed to make the paper \"the authority on all colonial questions.\"{{Sfn|Potter|2003|p=113}} When [[Lord Glenesk]] made him editor, the ''Morning Post'' had no offices, working instead in temporary wooden sheds.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=22\u201326}} He began expanding the paper by hiring [[Richard Jebb (journalist)|Richard Jebb]], who then hired many other correspondents. The two began focusing the paper on the British Dominions, a move they felt would increase circulation; they were proven wrong, though it did increase advertising revenue.{{Sfn|Potter|2003|p=|pp=113\u2013117}} Ware hired [[Robbie Ross]] as an art critic for the paper.{{Sfn|Fryer|2000|p=199}}\n\nAfter the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] in 1905, Ware campaigned heavily against war with Germany. He later said that {{quote|we threw the whole weight of the ''Morning Post'' against war with Germany. I am ashamed that I did not understand what we were doing at the time.

When the unit was disbanded in 1915, it had dealt with 12,000 casualties.<ref name=\"Veterans Agency\" />{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=33}}\n\n=== Graves Registration Commission ===\nWare was struck by the lack of an official mechanism for marking and recording the graves of those killed.<ref name = \"Veterans Agency\"/> In September 1914, following British defeats at [[Battle of Mons|Mons]] and [[Battle of Le Cateau|Le Cateau]], Ware's unit began sharing information with [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Robert Cecil]], the head of the Red Cross's Wounded and Missing department.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=38\u201342, 50}} In March 1915, with the support of [[Nevil Macready]],{{Sfn|Stamp|2010|p=72}} the British Army formally recognized a Grave Registration Commission (GRC). The commission represented a joint effort between the British Army and British Red Cross.{{Efn|Crane writes that \"in some ways the GRC remained a curious hybrid, semi-detached sort of unit - the Red Cross continued to supply men and vehicles, while Ware was given the local rank of major... and the army took on the costs of crosses, rations and fuel\" {{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=52}}|name=|group=}}{{Sfn|Crane|2013|pp=50\u201352}} On 22 May, he was made a temporary [[major]] in the British Army.{{Sfn|The London Gazette 21 May 1915}} On 9 September, the promotion was [[antedated]] to 22 February 1915.{{Sfn|The London Gazette 7 September 1915}} \n\nWare's work continued to expand: by May 1915, 4,300 graves had been registered. He was extensively involved in early organization of the commission, dividing it into two main parts and seven sections. That spring he began serving as an intermediary between the French and British governments over grave-related matters. The organization began handling requests at a headquarters in [[Lillers]], and the sections worked on grave maintenance. The organization was soon exempted from a ban on [[War photography|photography]] and a department of three photographers was created to photograph graves; by mid-August, six thousand graves had been photographed and eight hundred photographs sent to families. A further 18,173 graves had been registered. Around the same time Ware became unable to continue work with the Mobile Ambulance Unit, and began to solely focus on the commission.

Around June 1915, his efforts resulted in an 'expropriation bill' that began to be debated by the French government. Ware shepherded the bill through its passage, urging prominent figures such as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]], the [[Adjutant-General to the Forces|Adjutant-General]], the [[King of the United Kingdom|King]], and the editor of the ''Times'' to support it.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=|pp=59, 64}} The law passed the French government on 29 December 1917.{{Sfn|NYS Assembly|1918|p=548}} It gave Britain the ability to control their war graves in \"perpetuity of [[sepulture]]\"{{Sfn|Miles|2017|p=51}} and provided for the establishment of a British authority to manage the cemeteries.{{Sfn|Crane|2013|p=65}} \n\nWhen [[William Glynne Charles Gladstone]], a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] and the grandson of former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]], was [[killed in action]] near [[Laventie]] on 13 April 1915, his family attempted to have the body [[Exhumation|exhumed]] and returned to England.

For example, [[Lionel Earle]], a member of the International War Graves Committee, objected to the Army's practice of marking the graves of [[deserters]] with unmarked wooden crosses. As a result the custom was abolished. In 1916, efforts to neaten the cemeteries began.

At launch, the Aztek was available with either [[front-wheel drive]] or Versatrak, a full-time, fully automatic [[all-wheel drive]] system which provided traction in the snow or rain and could handle moderately rough off-road surfaces.\n\nThe Aztek was one of the first automobiles to be designed entirely using computerized rapid-prototyping/rapid-visualization tools.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The dashboard was designed by [[Johnson Controls]], and featured Pontiac's trademark red lighting scheme along with an optional [[heads-up display]].<ref>{{cite press |agency= Johnson Controls |date= August 7, 2000 |title= Versatile Features in Pontiac Aztek Interior Reflect Johnson Controls' Outstanding Capabilities | publisher= PRNewsWire| url= http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-07-2000/0001284297&EDATE=}}</ref>\n\nThe Aztek was able to carry within its interior a standard {{convert|4|ft|m}} by {{convert|8|ft|m}} sheet of [[plywood]] and was available with two rear cargo area options: a pull-out cargo tray that held up to {{convert|400|lb}} that rolled on built-in wheels when removed from the vehicle, or a versatile [[cargo net]] system that held up to {{convert|200|lb}} and could be configured (a claimed) 22 different ways. Options included a center console that doubled as a removable cooler and a tent/inflatable mattress package that, along with a built-in [[air compressor]], allowed the Aztek to double as a [[Campervan|camper]]. Extending this image was a seat-back mounted [[backpacks|backpack]], and a number of specialty racks for [[bicycle]]s, [[canoe]]s, [[snowboard]]s, and other such items. An optional 10 speaker [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] stereo system provided a set of controls located at the rear of the vehicle for tail-gate parties as well as an unusual 2-piece tailgate with built-in cup-holders and contoured seating area for added comfort.\n\n==Safety==\nThe [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) gave the Aztek a ''Marginal'' overall score in the frontal offset test.

After the 2001 model year, the GT model was dropped and pricing was slashed, in addition to extremely generous rebates and cut-rate financing instituted by GM in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe Aztek had among the highest [[American Customer Satisfaction Index|CSI]] (Customer Satisfaction Index) scores in its class, and won the appellation of \"Most Appealing Entry Sport Utility Vehicle\" in 2001 from [[J.D. Power and Associates]], an independent consumer survey organization which noted: \"The Aztek scores highest or second highest in every APEAL component measure except exterior styling.\"\n\nMatthew DeBord of ''The Big Money'' argued that despite its poor reviews and sales, the Aztek was the car that, in the long run, could save GM. He praised GM for being daring and trying to create an entirely new market in vehicles, rather than simply copying successful formulas. He argued that the Aztek's failure is similar to the failure of the [[Apple Newton|Apple's Newton]] and [[Mac Portable]] \u2013 two failed products that revolutionized the computer industry and became the basis for later successful products made by Apple.<ref>{{cite news |title=Montezuma's Aztek Revenge |author=Matthew DeBord |date=November 17, 2009 |work=The Big Money |url=http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2009/11/17/montezuma-s-aztek-revenge |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118152245/http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2009/11/17/montezuma-s-aztek-revenge |archivedate=November 18, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe Aztek's \"Design by Committee\" was criticized in [[Steve McConnell]]'s [[software design]] book, ''[[Code Complete|Code Complete 2]]''.<ref>[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000321.html The Pontiac Aztek and the Perils of Design by Committee], ''[[Coding Horror]]''</ref>\n\n==Year to year changes==\n\n===2001===\n[[File:2001-Pontiac-Aztek.jpg|200px|right|thumb|2001 Pontiac Aztek]]\n\n* All new model available as base model and GT both in front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive, the latter boasting an independent rear suspension.\n* In February 2001, a red Aztek served as the [[pace car]] for the [[Daytona 500]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NASCAR WCUP: Pontiac Aztek to pace Daytona 500|date=January 18, 2001|first=Terry|last=Callahan|work=The Auto Channel|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/date/20010117/news034620.html}}</ref>\n\n===2002===\n[[File:Pontiac-Aztek.jpg|200px|right|thumb|2002\u20132005 Pontiac Aztek]]\n*Cladding smoothed and changed to body colored, front marker light/[[Turn signal|indicators]] changed from amber to clear, spoiler added to rear glass gate.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===2003===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}\n*Aztek \"Rally Edition\" introduced, which was an option package which featured a lowered front suspension, a larger rear spoiler, body colored grille and 17\" chrome wheels.

When filming ended in 2013, one of the Azteks used in filming, which was wrecked and undrivable, sold at auction for US$7,800.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://autos.yahoo.com/blogs/motoramic/walter-white-pontiac-aztek-menace-driveway-breaking-bad-143741331.html |title=Walter White's Pontiac Aztek can menace your driveway in \"Breaking Bad\" prop auction |author=Justin Hyde |publisher=Motoramic - Yahoo Autos |date=Sep 20, 2013 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://screenbid.auctionserver.net/view-auctions/catalog/id/6/lot/50/?url=%2Fview-auctions%2Fcatalog%2Fid%2F6%2F%3Fpage%3D2%26sort%3D5%26dir%3D1 |title=Lot 20 of 514: Walter White's 'Breaking Bad' Aztek |publisher=ScreenBid LLC |date=2013-09-29 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref>\n\n==Original concept==\nFirst shown to the public in 1999, the Pontiac Aztek [[concept car]] was well received.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pontiac Aztek 2000-2005|publisher=autoevolution|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/cars/pontiac-aztek-2000.html}}</ref> It featured \"Xtreme\" futuristic styling and promised maximum versatility in support of a young and active lifestyle for its intended \"[[Generation X]]\" buyer demographic.\n\nThe Pontiac Aztek went on sale in summer 2000 as a 2001 model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000304112829/http://www.pontiac.com:80/aztek/index.html|title=Aztek Home Page|date=March 4, 2000|website=web.archive.org}}</ref>\n\nThe production edition of the Aztek was launched with the tagline \"Quite possibly the most versatile vehicle on the planet\" in conjunction with [[CBS]]'s hit game show ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]'' in 2000.<ref name=\"cbs.com\">{{cite web|title=Survivor recap: Season 2, Episode 13|publisher=CBS|url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor/recaps/213/recaps.php?season=2|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018095815/http://www.cbs.com/primetime/survivor/recaps/213/recaps.php?season=2|archivedate=2012-10-18}}</ref>\n\n==Styling==\n[[File:Aztek1.JPG|thumb|left]]\n[[File:Pontiac Aztek IMG 20180408 125542.jpg|thumb|left]]\nThe Aztek was styled under the direction of Tom Peters, who would later design the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C7)]].<ref name=\"Peters\">{{cite web | title = 2014 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray Convertible\n  | publisher =Tellmenews.com, April 11, 2013, Sharon Wagner \n  | url =http://tellmenews.com/2014-chevrolet-corvette-stingray-convertible-take-a-look/178410/sharon-wagner}}</ref><ref name=\"Peters2\">{{cite web | title = 2014 Chevrolet Corvette Convertible First Look | publisher =Edmunds.com, 03/04/2013, Bill Visnic | url =http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/features/2014-chevrolet-corvette-convertible-first-look.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Peters3\">{{cite web| title = Gm's Aztek: Born To Be A Little Too Wild | publisher = BusinessWeek | date= 2000-12-17 |first=David |last=Welch\n  | url =http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2000-12-17/gms-aztek-born-to-be-a-little-too-wild}}</ref> According to an analysis in 2000, ''[[BusinessWeek]]'' said the Aztek was to signal a design renaissance for GM,<ref name=\"Peters3\" /> and to \"make a statement about breaking from GM's instinct for caution.\"<ref name=\"Peters3\" /> One designer said that during the design process, the Aztek was made \"aggressive for the sake of being aggressive.\"<ref name=\"Peters3\" /> Peters, the Chief Designer said \"we wanted to do a bold, in-your-face vehicle that wasn't for everybody.\"<ref name=\"Peters3\" /> The 2000 Business Week study said the Aztek was \"the first awkward step toward innovation by a company that has avoided that path,\" likening \"the debacle to Ford's remodeling of its [[Ford Taurus (third generation)|1996 Taurus sedan]].\"<ref name=\"Peters3\" /> The front of the vehicle seems to be an attempt at reviving an appearance Pontiac used in the 1970s with the [[Pontiac GTO#1971|Pontiac GTO]], and was a shared appearance with the [[Pontiac Grand Am#1992\u20131998|Grand Am]].\n\nUltimately, the Aztek was criticized for its styling. [[Mickey Kaus]] described the Aztek as having \"awkwardly empty and square front wheel wells\" and a \"gratuitous, fierce animalistic snout, which may have been what prompted incoming GM executive [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] to famously say that many of the company's products looked like 'angry kitchen appliances.'\"<ref name=\"slate\">{{cite web\n  | title = Advance to the Rear\n  | publisher =Slate\n  | url =http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/gearbox/2003/05/advance_to_the_rear_2.html}}</ref>  James Hall, vice-president at  AutoPacific Inc<ref name=\"Peters3\"/> ranked the Aztek as one of the ten ugliest cars of all time, Karl Brauer, CEO and editor-in-chief of TotalCarScore.com said the Aztek featured \"atrocious proportions wrapped in plastic body cladding,\" and \"looked like a station wagon stretched out by a car bomb.\"<ref name=\"brauer\">{{cite web\n  | title = 10 ugliest cars of all time | publisher= Yahoo!\n  | work=CNBC | first=Daniel|last= Bukszpan | date=March 21, 2013\n  | url = http://autos.yahoo.com/news/10-ugliest-cars-of-all-time-231104344.html?page=all}}</ref>\n\nA poll in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in August 2008 placed the Aztek at number one of the \"100 ugliest cars\" of all time.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 100 Ugliest Cars|work=The Daily Telegraph |date= August 25, 2008|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/main.jhtml?xml=/motoring/2008/08/29/mfcars5.xml&page=2 | location=London | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref>   An article by [[Edmunds.com]] placed the car first of the \"100 Worst Cars of All Time\" not only because of its styling but also because it \"destroyed an 84-year-old automaker.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=100 Worst Cars of All Time|work=Edmunds.com|date=December 12, 2011 |url= http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/features/100-worst-cars-of-all-time.html|accessdate=December 24, 2012}}</ref> ''[[TIME Magazine|Time]]'' magazine in 2007 named the Aztek one of the 50 worst cars of all time (adding that underneath \"was a useful, competent crossover\"),<ref>{{cite news|title=The 50 Worst Cars of All Time|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1658544_1658540,00.html | date=September 7, 2007 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}</ref> and again in 2010 as one of the 50 worst inventions of all time.<ref>{{cite news|title=The 50 Worst Inventions|work=Time|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1991915_1991909_1991765,00.html | date=May 27, 2010 | accessdate=May 31, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Technology and notable features==\nThe Aztek was produced at General Motors' [[Ramos Arizpe]], Mexico, assembly plant, where it shared an assembly line with the [[Buick Rendezvous]].  In Canada, it filled the gap left since the [[Chevrolet Tracker (Americas)|Sunrunner]]'s discontinuation in 1997, while in the US and Mexico it was the first Pontiac-badged SUV ever sold. At launch, the Aztek was available with either [[front-wheel drive]] or Versatrak, a full-time, fully automatic [[all-wheel drive]] system which provided traction in the snow or rain and could handle moderately rough off-road surfaces.\n\nThe Aztek was one of the first automobiles to be designed entirely using computerized rapid-prototyping/rapid-visualization tools.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The dashboard was designed by [[Johnson Controls]], and featured Pontiac's trademark red lighting scheme along with an optional [[heads-up display]].<ref>{{cite press |agency= Johnson Controls |date= August 7, 2000 |title= Versatile Features in Pontiac Aztek Interior Reflect Johnson Controls' Outstanding Capabilities | publisher= PRNewsWire| url= http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/08-07-2000/0001284297&EDATE=}}</ref>\n\nThe Aztek was able to carry within its interior a standard {{convert|4|ft|m}} by {{convert|8|ft|m}} sheet of [[plywood]] and was available with two rear cargo area options: a pull-out cargo tray that held up to {{convert|400|lb}} that rolled on built-in wheels when removed from the vehicle, or a versatile [[cargo net]] system that held up to {{convert|200|lb}} and could be configured (a claimed) 22 different ways. Options included a center console that doubled as a removable cooler and a tent/inflatable mattress package that, along with a built-in [[air compressor]], allowed the Aztek to double as a [[Campervan|camper]]. Extending this image was a seat-back mounted [[backpacks|backpack]], and a number of specialty racks for [[bicycle]]s, [[canoe]]s, [[snowboard]]s, and other such items. An optional 10 speaker [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]] stereo system provided a set of controls located at the rear of the vehicle for tail-gate parties as well as an unusual 2-piece tailgate with built-in cup-holders and contoured seating area for added comfort.\n\n==Safety==\nThe [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) gave the Aztek a ''Marginal'' overall score in the frontal offset test.

After the 2001 model year, the GT model was dropped and pricing was slashed, in addition to extremely generous rebates and cut-rate financing instituted by GM in the wake of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001]].{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe Aztek had among the highest [[American Customer Satisfaction Index|CSI]] (Customer Satisfaction Index) scores in its class, and won the appellation of \"Most Appealing Entry Sport Utility Vehicle\" in 2001 from [[J.D. Power and Associates]], an independent consumer survey organization which noted: \"The Aztek scores highest or second highest in every APEAL component measure except exterior styling.\"\n\nMatthew DeBord of ''The Big Money'' argued that despite its poor reviews and sales, the Aztek was the car that, in the long run, could save GM. He praised GM for being daring and trying to create an entirely new market in vehicles, rather than simply copying successful formulas. He argued that the Aztek's failure is similar to the failure of the [[Apple Newton|Apple's Newton]] and [[Mac Portable]] \u2013 two failed products that revolutionized the computer industry and became the basis for later successful products made by Apple.<ref>{{cite news |title=Montezuma's Aztek Revenge |author=Matthew DeBord |date=November 17, 2009 |work=The Big Money |url=http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2009/11/17/montezuma-s-aztek-revenge |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118152245/http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/judgments/2009/11/17/montezuma-s-aztek-revenge |archivedate=November 18, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe Aztek's \"Design by Committee\" was criticized in [[Steve McConnell]]'s [[software design]] book, ''[[Code Complete|Code Complete 2]]''.<ref>[http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000321.html The Pontiac Aztek and the Perils of Design by Committee], ''[[Coding Horror]]''</ref>\n\n==Year to year changes==\n\n===2001===\n[[File:2001-Pontiac-Aztek.jpg|200px|right|thumb|2001 Pontiac Aztek]]\n\n* All new model available as base model and GT both in front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive, the latter boasting an independent rear suspension.\n* In February 2001, a red Aztek served as the [[pace car]] for the [[Daytona 500]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NASCAR WCUP: Pontiac Aztek to pace Daytona 500|date=January 18, 2001|first=Terry|last=Callahan|work=The Auto Channel|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/date/20010117/news034620.html}}</ref>\n\n===2002===\n[[File:Pontiac-Aztek.jpg|200px|right|thumb|2002\u20132005 Pontiac Aztek]]\n*Cladding smoothed and changed to body colored, front marker light/[[Turn signal|indicators]] changed from amber to clear, spoiler added to rear glass gate.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n===2003===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}\n*Aztek \"Rally Edition\" introduced, which was an option package which featured a lowered front suspension, a larger rear spoiler, body colored grille and 17\" chrome wheels.
