{"title_page": "DNA virus", "text_new": "{{short description|Virus that has DNA as its genetic material}}\nA '''DNA virus''' is a [[virus]] that has [[DNA]] as its [[genetic material]] and replicates using a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]. The [[nucleic acid]] is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA [[genome]], they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like [[smallpox]], [[herpes]], and the [[chickenpox]] are caused by such DNA viruses.\n\n==Group I: dsDNA viruses==\n[[File:Hhv6 genome2.png|thumb|450px|alt=HHV-6 genome|Genome of ''[[human herpesvirus-6]]'', a member of the family [[Herpesviridae]]]]\n[[Genome]] organization within this group varies considerably. Some have circular genomes (''Baculoviridae'', ''Papovaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') while others have linear genomes (''Adenoviridae'', ''Herpesviridae'' and some phages). Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes ([[phage T4]] and some ''Iridoviridae''). Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends (''Poxviridae'' and ''Phycodnaviridae'').\n\nA virus infecting [[archaea]] was first described in 1974. Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes. Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist.\n\n[[Order (biology)|Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity. It is thought that morphology is more conserved in this group than sequence similarity or gene order which is extremely variable. Three orders and 31 [[family (biology)|families]] are currently recognised. A fourth order\u2014[[Megavirales]]\u2014for the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses has been proposed.<ref name=Colson2012 /><ref name=\"Colson2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Colson P, De Lamballerie X, Yutin N, Asgari S, Bigot Y, Bideshi DK, Cheng XW, Federici BA, Van Etten JL, Koonin EV, La Scola B, Raoult D | title = \"Megavirales\", a proposed new order for eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 158 | issue = 12 | pages = 2517\u20132521 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23812617 | pmc = 4066373 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-013-1768-6 }}</ref> This proposal has yet to be ratified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]].

The ''Bacillariodnaviridae'' infect [[diatom]]s and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular (~6 kilobases in length): the minor chromosome is linear (~1 kilobase in length) and complementary to part of the major chromosome. Members of the ''Spiraviridae'' infect archaea. Members of the ''Genomoviridae'' infect fungi.\n\n===Molecular biology===\nAll viruses in this group require formation of a replicative form\u2014a double stranded DNA intermediate\u2014for genome replication.

There are two types of DNA satellite viruses\u2014the [[alphasatellite]]s and the [[betasatellite]]s\u2014both of which are dependent on [[begomovirus]]es. At present satellite viruses are not classified into genera or higher taxa.\n\nAlphasatellites are small circular single strand DNA viruses that require a begomovirus for transmission. Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.\n\n==Phylogenetic relationships==\n===Introduction===\n\nPhylogenetic relationships between these families are difficult to determine. The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation. Most studies that have attempted to determine these relationships are based either on some of the more conserved proteins\u2014DNA polymerase and others\u2014or on common structural features. In general most of the proposed relationships are tentative and have not yet been used by the ICTV in their classification.\n\n===ds DNA viruses===\n====Herpesviruses and caudoviruses====\nWhile determining the phylogenetic relations between the various known clades of viruses is difficult, on a number of grounds the herpesviruses and caudoviruses appear to be related.\n\nWhile the three families in the order Herpesvirales are clearly related on morphological grounds, it has proven difficult to determine the dates of divergence between them because of the lack of gene conservation.<ref name=McGeoch2006/> On morphological grounds they appear to be related to the bacteriophages\u2014specifically the Caudoviruses.\n\nThe branching order among the herpesviruses suggests that ''Alloherpesviridae'' is the basal clade and that ''Herpesviridae'' and ''Malacoherpesviridae'' are sister clades.<ref name=\"Davison2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison AJ | title = Herpesvirus systematics | journal = Veterinary Microbiology | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 52\u201369 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20346601 | pmc = 2995426 | doi = 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.014 }}</ref> Given the phylogenetic distances between vertebrates and molluscs this suggests that herpesviruses were initially fish viruses and that they have evolved with their hosts to infect other vertebrates.\n\nThe vertebrate herpesviruses initially evolved ~{{Ma|400}} and underwent subsequent evolution on the supercontinent [[Pangaea]].<ref name=Grose2012/> The alphaherpesvirinae separated from the branch leading to the betaherpesvirinae and gammaherpesvirinae about {{Ma|180}} to {{Ma|220}}.<ref name=McGeoch1995/> The avian herpes viruses diverged from the branch leading to the mammalian species.<ref name=McGeoch1994/> The mammalian species divided into two branches\u2014the Simplexvirus and Varicellovirus genera. This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.\n\nSeveral dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the portal, sealing the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the [[terminase]] (''UL15'') is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene is also found in [[T4-like]] [[bacteriophages]] suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses.<ref name=Davison2002/> Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.<ref name=\"Koonin2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Krupovic M, Yutin N | title = Evolution of double-stranded DNA viruses of eukaryotes: from bacteriophages to transposons to giant viruses | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1341 | issue = 1 | pages = 10\u201324 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25727355 | pmc = 4405056 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12728 | bibcode = 2015NYASA1341...10K }}</ref>\n\nA common origin for the herpesviruses and the caudoviruses has been suggested on the basis of parallels in their capsid assembly pathways and similarities between their portal complexes, through which DNA enters the capsid.<ref name=Baker2005/> These two groups of viruses share a distinctive 12-fold arrangement of subunits in the portal complex.

These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles. Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the [[Euryarchaeota]], whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the [[Crenarchaeota]]. Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most of these are members of the [[Firmicutes]] and \u03b3-[[proteobacteria]].\n\nThe vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic. The family [[Siphoviridae]] is the largest family (>3600 descriptions: 57.3%). The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.<ref name=Ackermann2003/> They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.\n\nAll of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.\n\nA putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.<ref name=Ackermann1998/>\n\nTailed phages originated in the early [[Precambrian]], long before [[eukaryote]]s and their viruses. The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 [[nanometer]]s in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry. The [[capsid]] contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases. The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus. The head and tail were held together by a connector. The viral particle contained no [[lipid]]s, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%). Most of the genome coded for structural proteins. Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes. Lytic enzymes were probably coded for. Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.\n\nThe virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA. Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA [[concatemer]]s.\n\nNew phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a [[peptidoglycan hydrolase]]. Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold. They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion. Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later. The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.\n\nSubsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads. Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an [[integrase]]\u2013[[excisionase]] complex, [[plasmid]] parts or [[transposon]]s.\n\nA possible evolutionary pathway using vesicles rather than a protein coat has been described in the archaeal plasmid pR1SE.<ref name=Erdmann2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdmann S, Tschitschko B, Zhong L, Raftery MJ, Cavicchioli R | title = A plasmid from an

material}}\nA '''DNA virus''' is a [[virus]] that has [[DNA]] as its [[genetic material]] and replicates using a DNA-dependent [[DNA polymerase]]. The [[nucleic acid]] is usually double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) but may also be single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). DNA viruses belong to either ''Group I'' or ''Group II'' of the [[Baltimore classification]] system for viruses. Single-stranded DNA is usually expanded to double-stranded in infected cells. Although ''Group VII'' viruses such as [[hepatitis B]] contain a DNA [[genome]], they are not considered DNA viruses according to the Baltimore classification, but rather [[reverse transcribing viruses]] because they replicate through an RNA intermediate. Notable diseases like [[smallpox]], [[herpes]], and the [[chickenpox]] are caused by such DNA viruses.\n\n==Group I: dsDNA viruses==\n[[File:Hhv6 genome2.png|thumb|450px|alt=HHV-6 genome|Genome of ''[[human herpesvirus-6]]'', a member of the family [[Herpesviridae]]]]\n[[Genome]] organization within this group varies considerably. Some have circular genomes (''Baculoviridae'', ''Papovaviridae'' and ''Polydnaviridae'') while others have linear genomes (''Adenoviridae'', ''Herpesviridae'' and some phages). Some families have circularly permuted linear genomes ([[phage T4]] and some ''Iridoviridae''). Others have linear genomes with covalently closed ends (''Poxviridae'' and ''Phycodnaviridae'').\n\nA virus infecting [[archaea]] was first described in 1974. Several others have been described since: most have head-tail morphologies and linear double-stranded DNA genomes. Other morphologies have also been described: spindle shaped, rod shaped, filamentous, icosahedral and spherical. Additional morphological types may exist.\n\n[[Order (biology)|Order]]s within this group are defined on the basis of morphology rather than DNA sequence similarity. It is thought that morphology is more conserved in this group than sequence similarity or gene order which is extremely variable. Three orders and 31 [[family (biology)|families]] are currently recognised. A fourth order\u2014[[Megavirales]]\u2014for the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses has been proposed.<ref name=Colson2012 /><ref name=\"Colson2013\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Colson P, De Lamballerie X, Yutin N, Asgari S, Bigot Y, Bideshi DK, Cheng XW, Federici BA, Van Etten JL, Koonin EV, La Scola B, Raoult D | title = \"Megavirales\", a proposed new order for eukaryotic nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 158 | issue = 12 | pages = 2517\u20132521 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 23812617 | pmc = 4066373 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-013-1768-6 }}</ref> This proposal has yet to be ratified by the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses|ICTV]].

These two viruses have been placed in the families ''[[Pleolipoviridae]]'' and ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Taxonomy===\n\nFamilies in this group have been assigned on the basis of the nature of the genome (circular or linear) and the host range. Twelve families are currently recognised.\n\n* Family ''[[Anelloviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Bacilladnavirus|Bacilladnaviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Bidnaviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Circoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Geminiviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Genomoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Inoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Microviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Nanoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Parvoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Smacoviridae]]''\n* Family ''[[Spiraviridae]]''\n\n===Classification===\nA division of the circular single stranded viruses into four types has been proposed.<ref name=Rosario2009/> This division seems likely to reflect their phylogenetic relationships.\n\nType I genomes are characterized by a small circular DNA genome (approximately 2-kb), with the Rep protein and the major open reading frame (ORF) in opposite orientations. This type is characteristic of the circoviruses, geminiviruses and nanoviruses.\n\nType II genomes have the unique feature of two separate Rep ORFs.\n\nType III genomes contain two major ORFs in the same orientation. This arrangement is typical of the anelloviruses.\n\nType IV genomes have the largest genomes of nearly 4-kb, with up to eight ORFs. This type of genome is found in the Inoviridae and the Microviridae.\n\nGiven the variety of single stranded viruses that have been described this scheme\u2014if it is accepted by the ICTV\u2014will need to be extended.\n\n====CRESS DNA viruses====\n\nAll known eukaryotic ssDNA viruses have icosahedral capsids. With the exception of the family ''Bidnaviridae'' and ''Anelloviridae'', all eukaryotic ssDNA viruses encode homologous rolling-circle replication initiation proteins with characteristic N-terminal endonuclease domains and C-terminal superfamily three helicase domains.<ref name=Krupovic2013>Krupovic M (2013) \"Networks of evolutionary interactions underlying the polyphyletic origin of ssDNA viruses\".

In both the ''Geminiviridae'' and ''Nanoviridae'' the genome is composed of more than a single chromosome. The ''Bacillariodnaviridae'' infect [[diatom]]s and have a unique genome: the major chromosome is circular (~6 kilobases in length): the minor chromosome is linear (~1 kilobase in length) and complementary to part of the major chromosome. Members of the ''Spiraviridae'' infect archaea. Members of the ''Genomoviridae'' infect fungi.\n\n===Molecular biology===\nAll viruses in this group require formation of a replicative form\u2014a double stranded DNA intermediate\u2014for genome replication.

Betasatellites are small linear single stranded DNA viruses that require a begomovirus to replicate.\n\n==Phylogenetic relationships==\n===Introduction===\n\nPhylogenetic relationships between these families are difficult to determine. The genomes differ significantly in size and organisation. Most studies that have attempted to determine these relationships are based either on some of the more conserved proteins\u2014DNA polymerase and others\u2014or on common structural features. In general most of the proposed relationships are tentative and have not yet been used by the ICTV in their classification.\n\n===ds DNA viruses===\n====Herpesviruses and caudoviruses====\nWhile determining the phylogenetic relations between the various known clades of viruses is difficult, on a number of grounds the herpesviruses and caudoviruses appear to be related.\n\nWhile the three families in the order Herpesvirales are clearly related on morphological grounds, it has proven difficult to determine the dates of divergence between them because of the lack of gene conservation.<ref name=McGeoch2006/> On morphological grounds they appear to be related to the bacteriophages\u2014specifically the Caudoviruses.\n\nThe branching order among the herpesviruses suggests that ''Alloherpesviridae'' is the basal clade and that ''Herpesviridae'' and ''Malacoherpesviridae'' are sister clades.<ref name=\"Davison2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Davison AJ | title = Herpesvirus systematics | journal = Veterinary Microbiology | volume = 143 | issue = 1 | pages = 52\u201369 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20346601 | pmc = 2995426 | doi = 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.02.014 }}</ref> Given the phylogenetic distances between vertebrates and molluscs this suggests that herpesviruses were initially fish viruses and that they have evolved with their hosts to infect other vertebrates.\n\nThe vertebrate herpesviruses initially evolved ~{{Ma|400}} and underwent subsequent evolution on the supercontinent [[Pangaea]].<ref name=Grose2012/> The alphaherpesvirinae separated from the branch leading to the betaherpesvirinae and gammaherpesvirinae about {{Ma|180}} to {{Ma|220}}.<ref name=McGeoch1995/> The avian herpes viruses diverged from the branch leading to the mammalian species.<ref name=McGeoch1994/> The mammalian species divided into two branches\u2014the Simplexvirus and Varicellovirus genera. This latter divergence appears to have occurred around the time of the mammalian radiation.\n\nSeveral dsDNA bacteriophages and the herpesviruses encode a powerful ATP driven DNA translocating machine that encapsidates a viral genome into a preformed capsid shell or prohead. The critical components of the packaging machine are the packaging enzyme (terminase) which acts as the motor and the portal protein that forms the unique DNA entrance vertex of prohead. The terminase complex consists of a recognition subunit (small terminase) and an endonuclease/translocase subunit (large terminase) and cuts viral genome concatemers. It forms a motor complex containing five large terminase subunits. The terminase-viral DNA complex docks on the portal vertex. The pentameric motor processively translocates DNA until the head shell is full with one viral genome. The motor cuts the DNA again and dissociates from the full head, allowing head-finishing proteins to assemble on the portal, sealing the portal, and constructing a platform for tail attachment. Only a single gene encoding the putative ATPase subunit of the [[terminase]] (''UL15'') is conserved among all herpesviruses. To a lesser extent this gene is also found in [[T4-like]] [[bacteriophages]] suggesting a common ancestor for these two groups of viruses.<ref name=Davison2002/> Another paper has also suggested that herpesviruses originated among the bacteriophages.<ref name=\"Koonin2015\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Krupovic M, Yutin N | title = Evolution of double-stranded DNA viruses of eukaryotes: from bacteriophages to transposons to giant viruses | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1341 | issue = 1 | pages = 10\u201324 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25727355 | pmc = 4405056 | doi = 10.1111/nyas.12728 | bibcode = 2015NYASA1341...10K }}</ref>\n\nA common origin for the herpesviruses and the caudoviruses has been suggested on the basis of parallels in their capsid assembly pathways and similarities between their portal complexes, through which DNA enters the capsid.<ref name=Baker2005/> These two groups of viruses share a distinctive 12-fold arrangement of subunits in the portal complex.

These are nearly exclusively hyperthermophiles or extreme halophiles. Tailed archaeal viruses are found only in the [[Euryarchaeota]], whereas most filamentous and pleomorphic archaeal viruses occur in the [[Crenarchaeota]]. Bacterial viruses belong to 10 families and infect members of 179 bacterial genera: most of these are members of the [[Firmicutes]] and \u03b3-[[proteobacteria]].\n\nThe vast majority (96.3%) are tailed with and only 230 (3.7%) are polyhedral, filamentous or pleomorphic. The family [[Siphoviridae]] is the largest family (>3600 descriptions: 57.3%). The tailed phages appear to be monophyletic and are the oldest known virus group.<ref name=Ackermann2003/> They arose repeatedly in different hosts and there are at least 11 separate lines of descent.\n\nAll of the known temperate phages employ one of only three different systems for their lysogenic cycle: lambda-like integration/excision, Mu-like transposition or the plasmid-like partitioning of phage N15.\n\nA putative course of evolution of these phages has been proposed by Ackermann.<ref name=Ackermann1998/>\n\nTailed phages originated in the early [[Precambrian]], long before [[eukaryote]]s and their viruses. The ancestral tailed phage had an icosahedral head of about 60 [[nanometer]]s in diameter and a long non contractile tail with sixfold symmetry. The [[capsid]] contained a single molecule of double stranded DNA of about 50 kilobases. The tail was probably provided with a fixation apparatus. The head and tail were held together by a connector. The viral particle contained no [[lipid]]s, was heavier than its descendant viruses and had a high DNA content proportional to its capsid size (~50%). Most of the genome coded for structural proteins. Morphopoietic genes clustered at one end of the genome, with head genes preceding tail genes. Lytic enzymes were probably coded for. Part of the phage genome was nonessential and possibly bacterial.\n\nThe virus infected its host from the outside and injected its DNA. Replication involved transcription in several waves and formation of DNA [[concatemer]]s.\n\nNew phages were released by burst of the infected cell after lysis of host membranes by a [[peptidoglycan hydrolase]]. Capsids were assembled from a starting point, the connector and around a scaffold. They underwent an elaborate maturation process involving protein cleavage and capsid expansion. Heads and tails were assembled separately and joined later. The DNA was cut to size and entered preformed capsids by a headful mechanism.\n\nSubsequently, the phages evolved contractile or short tails and elongated heads. Some viruses become temperate by acquiring an [[integrase]]\u2013[[excisionase]] complex, [[plasmid]] parts or [[transposon]]s.\n\nA possible evolutionary pathway using vesicles rather than a protein coat has been described in the archaeal plasmid pR1SE.<ref name=Erdmann2017>{{cite journal | vauthors = Erdmann S, Tschitschko B, Zhong L, Raftery MJ, Cavicchioli R | title = A plasmid from an

Rotberg]], African nationalism would not have emerged without colonialism.{{sfn|Rotberg|1966|p=37}} Its relation to [[Pan-Africanism]] was also ambiguous with many nationalist leaders professing Pan-African loyalties but still refusing to commit to [[supranational union]]s.

The history of studies of women's involvement in African nationalist struggle, mobilization, and party politics can be traced along intellectual and political paths that initially followed, later paralleled, but have seldom deviated from or led the course of Africanist historiography. The goal of these women involved in the African nationalism movement was to recover Africa's past and to celebrate the independent emergence of independent Africa. It was necessary to raise awareness of this cause, calling to the new emerging generation of African women, raised in a better, more stable society. Although, the challenges they faced seemed increasingly more significant, they however had it better than past generations, allowing them to raise awareness of the African Nationalist moment. Whereas women's historians interested in effecting changes in the process and production of American or European history had to fight their way onto trains that had been moving through centuries on well-worn gauges, the \"new\" Africanist train had barely left the station in the early '60s. With a few exceptions, scholars have devoted little more than a passing mention of the presence of African women as conscious political actors in African nationalism. [[Anne McClintock]] has stressed that \"all nationalisms are gendered.\"<ref>A. McClintock, \u2018\u201cNo Longer in Future Heaven\u201d: Gender, Race and Nationalism,\u2019 in Dangerous Liaisons: Gender, Nation and Postcolonial Perspectives ed. A. McClintock, A. Mufti, E. Shohat (United States, 1997).</ref>  Undoubtedly, women played a significant role in arousing national consciousness as well as elevating their own political and social position through African nationalism.<ref>S. Geiger, J.M Allman and N. Musisi, Women in African Colonial Histories (Bloomington, 2002).</ref> It is with this in mind, that both feminism and the research of these women become critical to the re-evaluation of the history of African nationalism. In 1943, a prominent organization called the African National Congress Women's League used its branches throughout the country to build a national campaign.\n\n===Women in national organisations===\nAs leaders and activists, women participated in African nationalism through national organisations. The decade of the 1950s was a landmark because of the significant number of women who were politically involved in the nationalist struggle. A minority of women were incorporated and affiliated into male-dominated national organisations. Founded by women in 1960, The [[National Council of Sierra Leone]] was to become, in 1968, the women's section of the ruling [[All People's Congress]] and dedicated primarily to the vigorous support of head of state, President Stevens. Women activists extended and conveyed militant behaviours. Nancy Dolly Steele was the organizing secretary and co-founder of the Congress, and has been noted for her militant political and nationalist activities. \nIn the same way, throughout Africa, the influence of trade union movements, in particular, became the spawning ground for women organisers as such.  South African women, for instance, emerged as primary catalysts for protests against the Apartheid regime. These women first participated in resistance movements through women's branches of the larger male dominated liberation organizations, as through the [[African National Congress]] (ANC). Nevertheless, in 1943, the ANC adopted a new constitution which included a new position for women to become full members of the national movement. Women also formed their own national organisations, such as the Federation of South African Women in 1954, which boasted a membership of 230,000 women. Though at the time women viewed themselves primarily as mothers and wives, the act of their joining in political organisations illustrated a kind of feminist consciousness.<ref>L. L. Frates, \u2018Women in the South African National Liberation Movement, 1948 \u2013 1960: An Historiographical Overview,\u2019 Ufahamu: A Journal of African Studies Vol. 21, No. 1-2 (1993).</ref>\n\n===Women as national leaders===\nWomen were fundamental nationalist leaders in their own right. Under the inspiration of [[Bibi Titi Mohammed]], a former singer in Dar es Salaam who became a Tanganyikan nationalist, Tanzanian women were organised into a Women's Section of the Tanganyikan African National Union. Mohammed, who was semi-illiterate, was an impressive orator and later combined her nationalist work in the 1950s with her political ambitions. She was one of the most visible Tanganyikan nationalists during the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.<ref>S. Geiger, \u201cWomen in Nationalist Struggle: Tanu Activists in Dar es Salaam,\u201d The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 20, No. 1, (1987), 1 \u2013 26.</ref> She was the only nationalist leader, besides [[Julius Nyerere]], who was recognized across the country at the time of Tanzanian independence.  Her legacy as a leader, speaker, organiser and activist is testimony to the pivotal role played by many uneducated women in spreading a national consciousness, a political awareness and securing independence from British rule in Tanzania.\n\n===Women and Informal Methods of Protest===\nWhilst some female-oriented initiatives may have been conceived and presented to women by male party-leaders, others were clearly created by women themselves. These women used nationalism as a platform to address their own concerns as wives, mothers, industrial workers, peasants, and as women affiliated to the ANC. The 1940s Anti-tax protest in [[Tanzania]] involved the women of Peasant Pare, where women employed methods of direct confrontation, provocative language and physical violence. Explicit use of sexual insult was also central to the powerful Anlu protest of the [[Cameroon]] in 1958, where women refused to implement agricultural regulations that would have undermined their farming system.<ref>Jean O'Barr, \u2018African Women in Politics,\u2019 in African Women South of the Sahara, ed. M. J. Hay and S. Stichter (London, 1984).</ref> In the same way, women used music, dance and informal methods to convey their solidarity for African nationalism. The production of Tanganyikan nationalism in Tanzania can be seen as \u201cwoman\u2019s work,\u201d where women evoked, created and performed nationalism through their dances and songs.<ref>S. Geiger, \u2018Women and African Nationalism,\u2019 Journal of Women's History Vol. 2, No.1 (SAPRING, 1990), 227 \u2013 244.</ref>  Equally, women were considered the best sloganeers, as traditional story-tellers and singers using ideas, images and phrases that appealed to the non-elite population. Market women in coastal Nigeria and Guinea also used their networks to convey anti-government information.<ref>E. Schmidt, \u2018Top Down or Bottom Up? Nationalist Mobilization Reconsidered, with Special Reference to Guinea (French West Africa,\u2019 American Historical Review (October, 2005), 975 \u2013 1014.</ref>  \u2018Ordinary\u2019 women themselves had transformed \"traditional\" methods for networking and expressing disapproval against individuals, into mechanisms for challenging and unsettling the local colonial administration. However, although these women contributed to African nationalist politics, they had limited impact as their strategies were concerned with shaming, retaliation, restitution and compensation, and were not directly about radical transformation. This problem was a reflection of the extent to which most African women had already been marginalized politically, economically and educationally under colonial regimes in Africa.<ref>S. Geiger, \u2018Women and African Nationalism,\u2019 Journal of Women's History Vol. 2, No.1 (SAPRING, 1990), 227 \u2013 244.</ref>\n\n==By country==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Gambia===\n{{main|Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof}}\n{{see also|Politics of the Gambia|History of the Gambia}}\nIn the [[The Gambia|Gambia]], one of the prominent Gambian nationalists and [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanists]] during the colonial era was [[Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof]]. From the 1950s up to [[Gambia Independence Act 1964|Gambia's independence]], Cham Joof (as he is commonly referred to), held a series of campaigns against the [[British Empire|British colonial]] administration. In 1958, he spearheaded the All Party Committee - the purpose of which was for self-governance and to determine the political direction of the Gambia free from European colonialism and neo-colonialism. In 1959, he organised the Bread and Butter demonstration from outside his house in Barthurst now [[Banjul]], and led his followers to Government House to lobby the British colonial administration. Following that demonstration, Cham Joof and his associates Crispin Grey Johnson and M. B. Jones were indicted as \"inciting the public to disobey the laws of the land\" and charged as political prisoners.<ref>*[[Foroyaa]] : [https://web.archive.org/web/20111003130110/http://www.foroyaa.gm/modules/news/article.php?storyid=6832 Exclusive interview with Foroyaa Panorama] (''TRIBUTE TO ALHAJI A.E.

Rotberg]], African nationalism would not have emerged without colonialism.{{sfn|Rotberg|1966|p=37}} Its relation to [[Pan-Africanism]] was also ambiguous with many nationalist leaders professing Pan-African loyalties but still refusing to commit to [[supranational union]]s.

The history of studies of women's involvement in African nationalist struggle, mobilization, and party politics can be traced along intellectual and political paths that initially followed, later paralleled, but have seldom deviated from or led the course of Africanist historiography. The goal of these women involved in the African nationalism movement was to recover Africa's past and to celebrate the independent emergence of independent Africa. It was necessary to raise awareness of this cause, calling to the new emerging generation of African women, raised in a better, more stable society. Although, the challenges they faced seemed increasingly more significant, they however had it better than past generations, allowing them to raise awareness of the African Nationalist moment. Whereas women's historians interested in effecting changes in the process and production of American or European history had to fight their way onto trains that had been moving through centuries on well-worn gauges, the \"new\" Africanist train had barely left the station in the early '60s. With a few exceptions, scholars have devoted little more than a passing mention of the presence of African women as conscious political actors in African nationalism. [[Anne McClintock]] has stressed that \"all nationalisms are gendered.\"<ref>A. McClintock, \u2018\u201cNo Longer in Future Heaven\u201d: Gender, Race and Nationalism,\u2019 in Dangerous Liaisons: Gender, Nation and Postcolonial Perspectives ed. A. McClintock, A. Mufti, E. Shohat (United States, 1997).</ref>  Undoubtedly, women played a significant role in arousing national consciousness as well as elevating their own political and social position through African nationalism.<ref>S. Geiger, J.M Allman and N. Musisi, Women in African Colonial Histories (Bloomington, 2002).</ref> It is with this in mind, that both feminism and the research of these women become critical to the re-evaluation of the history of African nationalism. In 1943, a prominent organization called the African National Congress Women's League used its branches throughout the country to build a national campaign.\n\n===Women in national organisations===\nAs leaders and activists, women participated in African nationalism through national organisations. The decade of the 1950s was a landmark because of the significant number of women who were politically involved in the nationalist struggle. A minority of women were incorporated and affiliated into male-dominated national organisations. Founded by women in 1960, The [[National Council of Sierra Leone]] was to become, in 1968, the women's section of the ruling [[All People's Congress]] and dedicated primarily to the vigorous support of head of state, President Stevens. Women activists extended and conveyed militant behaviours. Nancy Dolly Steele was the organizing secretary and co-founder of the Congress, and has been noted for her militant political and nationalist activities. \nIn the same way, throughout Africa, the influence of trade union movements, in particular, became the spawning ground for women organisers as such.  South African women, for instance, emerged as primary catalysts for protests against the Apartheid regime. These women first participated in resistance movements through women\u2019s branches of the larger male dominated liberation organizations, as through the [[African National Congress]] (ANC). Nevertheless, in 1943, the ANC adopted a new constitution which included a new position for women to become full members of the national movement. Women also formed their own national organisations, such as the Federation of South African Women in 1954, which boasted a membership of 230,000 women. Though at the time women viewed themselves primarily as mothers and wives, the act of their joining in political organisations illustrated a kind of feminist consciousness.<ref>L. L. Frates, \u2018Women in the South African National Liberation Movement, 1948 \u2013 1960: An Historiographical Overview,\u2019 Ufahamu: A Journal of African Studies Vol. 21, No. 1-2 (1993).</ref>\n\n===Women as national leaders===\nWomen were fundamental nationalist leaders in their own right. Under the inspiration of [[Bibi Titi Mohammed]], a former singer in Dar es Salaam who became a Tanganyikan nationalist, Tanzanian women were organised into a Women\u2019s Section of the Tanganyikan African National Union. Mohammed, who was semi-illiterate, was an impressive orator and later combined her nationalist work in the 1950s with her political ambitions. She was one of the most visible Tanganyikan nationalists during the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.<ref>S. Geiger, \u201cWomen in Nationalist Struggle: Tanu Activists in Dar es Salaam,\u201d The International Journal of African Historical Studies, Vol. 20, No. 1, (1987), 1 \u2013 26.</ref> She was the only nationalist leader, besides [[Julius Nyerere]], who was recognized across the country at the time of Tanzanian independence.  Her legacy as a leader, speaker, organiser and activist is testimony to the pivotal role played by many uneducated women in spreading a national consciousness, a political awareness and securing independence from British rule in Tanzania.\n\n===Women and Informal Methods of Protest===\nWhilst some female-oriented initiatives may have been conceived and presented to women by male party-leaders, others were clearly created by women themselves. These women used nationalism as a platform to address their own concerns as wives, mothers, industrial workers, peasants, and as women affiliated to the ANC. The 1940s Anti-tax protest in [[Tanzania]] involved the women of Peasant Pare, where women employed methods of direct confrontation, provocative language and physical violence. Explicit use of sexual insult was also central to the powerful Anlu protest of the [[Cameroon]] in 1958, where women refused to implement agricultural regulations that would have undermined their farming system.<ref>Jean O'Barr, \u2018African Women in Politics,\u2019 in African Women South of the Sahara, ed. M. J. Hay and S. Stichter (London, 1984).</ref> In the same way, women used music, dance and informal methods to convey their solidarity for African nationalism. The production of Tanganyikan nationalism in Tanzania can be seen as \u201cwoman\u2019s work,\u201d where women evoked, created and performed nationalism through their dances and songs.<ref>S. Geiger, \u2018Women and African Nationalism,\u2019 Journal of Women's History Vol. 2, No.1 (SAPRING, 1990), 227 \u2013 244.</ref>  Equally, women were considered the best sloganeers, as traditional story-tellers and singers using ideas, images and phrases that appealed to the non-elite population. Market women in coastal Nigeria and Guinea also used their networks to convey anti-government information.<ref>E. Schmidt, \u2018Top Down or Bottom Up? Nationalist Mobilization Reconsidered, with Special Reference to Guinea (French West Africa,\u2019 American Historical Review (October, 2005), 975 \u2013 1014.</ref>  \u2018Ordinary\u2019 women themselves had transformed \"traditional\" methods for networking and expressing disapproval against individuals, into mechanisms for challenging and unsettling the local colonial administration. However, although these women contributed to African nationalist politics, they had limited impact as their strategies were concerned with shaming, retaliation, restitution and compensation, and were not directly about radical transformation. This problem was a reflection of the extent to which most African women had already been marginalized politically, economically and educationally under colonial regimes in Africa.<ref>S. Geiger, \u2018Women and African Nationalism,\u2019 Journal of Women's History Vol. 2, No.1 (SAPRING, 1990), 227 \u2013 244.</ref>\n\n==By country==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Gambia===\n{{main|Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof}}\n{{see also|Politics of the Gambia|History of the Gambia}}\nIn the [[The Gambia|Gambia]], one of the prominent Gambian nationalists and [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanists]] during the colonial era was [[Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof]]. From the 1950s up to [[Gambia Independence Act 1964|Gambia's independence]], Cham Joof (as he is commonly referred to), held a series of campaigns against the [[British Empire|British colonial]] administration. In 1958, he spearheaded the All Party Committee - the purpose of which was for self-governance and to determine the political direction of the Gambia free from European colonialism and neo-colonialism. In 1959, he organised the Bread and Butter demonstration from outside his house in Barthurst now [[Banjul]], and led his followers to Government House to lobby the British colonial administration. Following that demonstration, Cham Joof and his associates Crispin Grey Johnson and M. B. Jones were indicted as \"inciting the public to disobey the laws of the land\" and charged as political prisoners.<ref>*[[Foroyaa]] : [https://web.archive.org/web/20111003130110/http://www.foroyaa.gm/modules/news/article.php?storyid=6832 Exclusive interview with Foroyaa Panorama] (''TRIBUTE TO ALHAJI A.E.

They are purely geographic regions; some correspond to historic countries, states or provinces. A region may comprise one or more divisions, averaging about three divisions per region. However, the boundaries of the regions and the boundaries of the divisions do not always coincide exactly. So far there has been no movement to give the regions official administrative status. If this was to be done, it would presumably require that the boundaries of the regions be slightly modified so that they correspond exactly with their constituent districts.\n\n* [[Regions of Assam]]\n* [[Regions of Gujarat]]\n\n== Districts ==\n{{main|List of districts in India}}\nStates and territories (or divisions) are further subdivided into [[Districts of India|districts]] (''zilla''), of which there are 722 (as of 2018).

They are purely geographic regions; some correspond to historic countries, states or provinces. A region may comprise one or more divisions, averaging about three divisions per region. However, the boundaries of the regions and the boundaries of the divisions do not always coincide exactly. So far there has been no movement to give the regions official administrative status. If this was to be done, it would presumably require that the boundaries of the regions be slightly modified so that they correspond exactly with their constituent districts.\n\n* [[Regions of Assam]]\n* [[Regions of Gujarat]]\n\n== Districts ==\n{{main|List of districts in India}}\nStates and territories (or divisions) are further subdivided into [[Districts of India|districts]] (''zilla''), of which there are 722 (as of 2018).

Eunice was also featured in her eponymous CBS [[Eunice (film)|made-for-TV movie]], which aired in 1982.<ref>McLean, Robert A. (March 14, 1982). \"A New Special from Carol Burnett: Reprise of her popular 'Eunice' role strikes a universal chord\", ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.</ref><ref>Shales, Tom (March 15, 1982). \"Too much 'Eunice'\", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', p. C11.</ref> The film starred Carol Burnett as Eunice; [[Ken Berry]] as Eunice's well-to-do brother, Philip (Berry played a different brother, [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Vinton_Harper|Vinton]], on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] TV series); [[Harvey Korman]] as Eunice's husband, [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Ed_Higgins|Ed Higgins]]; [[Betty White]] as Eunice's sister, [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Ellen_Harper|Ellen Harper-Jackson]]; [[Vicki Lawrence]] as Eunice's \"Mama\", [[Thelma Harper]]; and [[Dick Clair]] as the voice of Eunice's father, Carl Harper. The film takes the Harper family on a 23-year journey.\n\nEunice appeared occasionally on \"The Family\" skit's [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]''. As portrayed by Carol Burnett, Eunice was in five episodes of ''Mama's Family'', all of which were in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1, 2)|first life of ''Mama's Family'']] on [[NBC]]. Four of Burnett's five appearances were in season 1. The fifth episode of season 2 (\"Rashomama\"), which aired on November 3, 1983, was Burnett's final portrayal of Eunice. The character made two subsequent appearances in flashback episodes. Tanya Fenmore played Eunice as a child in the nineteenth episode of season 2 (\"Mama's Birthday).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640588/</ref> This marked the character's final appearance in the first life of the sitcom.\n\nEunice appeared only once during the [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life of ''Mama's Family'']] (originally in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]]). The character's final appearance was in the fourteenth episode of season 4 (\"The Sins of the Mother\"), portrayed as a teenager by Heather Kerr.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640615/</ref> Eunice is presented once more in voice only in the final episode of season 4 (\"Pomp and Circumstance\"); Eunice, voiced by Phyllis Franklin, spoke to Mama over the phone to inform her that she couldn't attend her son [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Bubba_Higgins|Bubba]]'s high school [[graduation]]. She declined to explain her reasons to Bubba, hanging up when Mama threatened to put him on the phone.\n\nAlways clad in a tattered green dress and wearing her hair in a 1940s-era perm, Eunice is a working-class homemaker married to Ed Higgins. Eunice had a stormy, irrepressible, browbeating persona, always going melodramatically out of control, ranting and raving.

The film takes the Harper family on a 23-year journey.\n\nEunice appeared occasionally on \"The Family\" skit's [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sitcom ''[[Mama's Family]]''. As portrayed by Carol Burnett, Eunice was in five episodes of ''Mama's Family'', all of which were in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1, 2)|first life of ''Mama's Family'']] on [[NBC]]. Four of Burnett's five appearances were in season 1. The fifth episode of season 2 (\"Rashomama\"), which aired on November 3, 1983, was Burnett's final portrayal of Eunice. The character made two subsequent appearances in flashback episodes. Tanya Fenmore played Eunice as a child in the nineteenth episode of season 2 (\"Mama's Birthday).<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640588/</ref> This marked the character's final appearance in the first life of the sitcom.\n\nEunice appeared only once during the [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life of ''Mama's Family'']] (originally in [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]]). The character's final appearance was in the fourteenth episode of season 4 (\"The Sins of the Mother\"), portrayed as a teenager by Heather Kerr.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0640615/</ref> Eunice is presented once more in voice only in the final episode of season 4 (\"Pomp and Circumstance\"); Eunice, voiced by Phyllis Franklin, spoke to Mama over the phone to inform her that she couldn't attend her son [[List_of_Mama%27s_Family_characters#Bubba_Higgins|Bubba]]'s high school [[graduation]]. She declined to explain her reasons to Bubba, hanging up when Mama threatened to put him on the phone.\n\nAlways clad in a tattered green dress and wearing her hair in a 1940s-era perm, Eunice is a working-class homemaker married to Ed Higgins. Eunice had a stormy, irrepressible, browbeating persona, always going melodramatically out of control, ranting and raving.

The Fair Trading Minister, Anthony Roberts, said that issue of vaccination was one of life and death and that the organization's activities endangered people's safety. Mr Roberts has warned other states against the AVN trying to register.

The Fair Trading Minister, Anthony Roberts, said that issue of vaccination was one of life and death and that the organization's activities endangered people's safety. Mr Roberts has warned other states against the AVN trying to register.

Conceptually, satellite cities could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. However, functioning as part of a metropolis, a satellite city experiences cross-commuting (that is, residents commuting out of and employees commuting into the city). \n\n<!--==Characteristics==\nSatellite cities are smaller cities near a large [[metropolis]], that:\n\n*predate the metropolis' suburban expansion\n*are at least partially independent from that metropolis economically and socially\n*are physically separated from the metropolis by rural territory or by a major geographic barrier such as a large river\n*have a traditional downtown surrounded by traditional \"inner city\" neighborhoods\n*may or may not be counted as part of the large metropolis' [[Table of United States Combined Statistical Areas|Combined Statistical Area]]\n\n===Quick reference===\nIn the [[United States]], the easiest way to tell if a community is a satellite city or some other type of development (see below) is to refer to the [[List of United States urban areas]], to see if it has its own independent urbanized area or is considered to be part of the urbanized area of its larger neighbor. This rule has exceptions, but should generally be followed.-->\n\n==Satellite cities versus other types of settlement==\nSatellite cities are different from and are sometimes confused with the following related patterns of development.\n\n===Suburbs===\nSatellite cities differ from [[suburb]]s in that they have distinct employment bases, commutersheds, and cultural offerings from the central metropolis, as well as an independent municipal government. Satellite cities are not [[bedroom communities]].\n\n===Edge cities===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nSatellite cities differ from [[edge city|edge cities]], which are suburbs with large employment bases and cultural offerings, in that satellite cities must have a true historic [[downtown]], a distinct independent [[municipal government]], existed as a city prior to becoming interconnected with the larger metropolitan core, and are surrounded by a belt of rural land between themselves and the central city.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nConceptually, both satellite cities and some types of edge city could be (and once were) self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas, but have become interconnected due to the suburban expansion of the larger metropolis. However, while edge cities may have their own government and share many characteristics with satellite cities, they are much more physically integrated with the core city and would not exist in anything like their present form if not for the suburban expansion of their larger neighbor. Edge cities are activity nodes within a metro area, not miniature metro areas themselves.\n\nSome satellite cities that are particularly close or well connected to their larger neighbors and/or have their own historic downtown may also qualify as the ''uptown'' variety of edge cities, but the terms are not synonymous.\n\n===Multi-polar cities===\nIn some cases large metropolitan areas have multiple centers of close to equal importance. These multi-polar cities are often referred to as [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin cities]]. Multi-polar cities differ from satellite cities in such cases :\n*satellites are clearly much less important than the larger center around which they are located, while the various nodes of multi-polar cities are close to each other in importance\n*satellites are separated from the larger center by a substantial belt of rural territory, while twin cities may be fully integrated in physical form\n\nFor example, [[Fort Worth, Texas]] is a twin of [[Dallas, Texas]] because though Fort Worth is somewhat smaller, it is proportionally close enough and physically integrated enough with Dallas to be considered a twin rather than a satellite.  However, [[Waco, Texas]] is a satellite town of both cities.   Generally speaking, cities that are listed as being part of the same [[List of United States urban areas|urbanized area]] should be considered twins, rather than one having a satellite relationship to the other.\n\n===Metropolitan areas===\nConceptually, satellite cities are miniature [[metro areas]] on the fringe of larger ones. Satellite cities are sometimes listed as part of the larger metro area, and sometimes listed as totally independent. In the United States, satellite cities are often (but not always) listed as independent [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]s within a single [[Table of United States Combined Statistical Areas|Combined Statistical Area]] that is unified with the larger metropolis.\n\n==Examples==\n{{seealso|List of satellite cities by population}}\n===Argentina===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March

Conceptually, satellite cities could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. However, functioning as part of a metropolis, a satellite city experiences cross-commuting (that is, residents commuting out of and employees commuting into the city). \n\n<!--==Characteristics==\nSatellite cities are smaller cities near a large [[metropolis]], that:\n\n*predate the metropolis' suburban expansion\n*are at least partially independent from that metropolis economically and socially\n*are physically separated from the metropolis by rural territory or by a major geographic barrier such as a large river\n*have a traditional downtown surrounded by traditional \"inner city\" neighborhoods\n*may or may not be counted as part of the large metropolis' [[Table of United States Combined Statistical Areas|Combined Statistical Area]]\n\n===Quick reference===\nIn the [[United States]], the easiest way to tell if a community is a satellite city or some other type of development (see below) is to refer to the [[List of United States urban areas]], to see if it has its own independent urbanized area or is considered to be part of the urbanized area of its larger neighbor. This rule has exceptions, but should generally be followed.-->\n\n==Satellite cities versus other types of settlement==\nSatellite cities are different from and are sometimes confused with the following related patterns of development.\n\n===Suburbs===\nSatellite cities differ from [[suburb]]s in that they have distinct employment bases, commutersheds, and cultural offerings from the central metropolis, as well as an independent municipal government. Satellite cities are not [[bedroom communities]].\n\n===Edge cities===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nSatellite cities differ from [[edge city|edge cities]], which are suburbs with large employment bases and cultural offerings, in that satellite cities must have a true historic [[downtown]], a distinct independent [[municipal government]], existed as a city prior to becoming interconnected with the larger metropolitan core, and are surrounded by a belt of rural land between themselves and the central city.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nConceptually, both satellite cities and some types of edge city could be (and once were) self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas, but have become interconnected due to the suburban expansion of the larger metropolis. However, while edge cities may have their own government and share many characteristics with satellite cities, they are much more physically integrated with the core city and would not exist in anything like their present form if not for the suburban expansion of their larger neighbor. Edge cities are activity nodes within a metro area, not miniature metro areas themselves.\n\nSome satellite cities that are particularly close or well connected to their larger neighbors and/or have their own historic downtown may also qualify as the ''uptown'' variety of edge cities, but the terms are not synonymous.\n\n===Multi-polar cities===\nIn some cases large metropolitan areas have multiple centers of close to equal importance. These multi-polar cities are often referred to as [[Twin cities (geographical proximity)|twin cities]]. Multi-polar cities differ from satellite cities in such cases :\n*satellites are clearly much less important than the larger center around which they are located, while the various nodes of multi-polar cities are close to each other in importance\n*satellites are separated from the larger center by a substantial belt of rural territory, while twin cities may be fully integrated in physical form\n\nFor example, [[Fort Worth, Texas]] is a twin of [[Dallas, Texas]] because though Fort Worth is somewhat smaller, it is proportionally close enough and physically integrated enough with Dallas to be considered a twin rather than a satellite.  However, [[Waco, Texas]] is a satellite town of both cities.   Generally speaking, cities that are listed as being part of the same [[List of United States urban areas|urbanized area]] should be considered twins, rather than one having a satellite relationship to the other.\n\n===Metropolitan areas===\nConceptually, satellite cities are miniature [[metro areas]] on the fringe of larger ones. Satellite cities are sometimes listed as part of the larger metro area, and sometimes listed as totally independent. In the United States, satellite cities are often (but not always) listed as independent [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]]s within a single [[Table of United States Combined Statistical Areas|Combined Statistical Area]] that is unified with the larger metropolis.\n\n==Examples==\n{{seealso|List of satellite cities by population}}\n===Argentina===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March
