It was released in October 1994 on [[Beggars Banquet Records]] and it is also the band's last album on [[Sire Records]] in the USA. It is also commonly referred to as the \"Black Sheep\" record, due to the image of a [[Manx Loaghtan]] [[black sheep]] on the front cover. The record also features one of the very rare times when Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy have shared songwriting credit with anyone: bassist Craig Adams is credited as co-author of \"Universal You\".\n\n==Musical style==\nThe style of music on the album is more reminiscent of the [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]] music popular at the time, and of [[noise rock]], with its use of [[distortion (music)|distortion]] and [[feedback]].\n\n==Album information==\n[[Vocalist]] [[Ian Astbury]] referred to the record as \"very personal, and very revealing\" songs about his life, with the subject matter ranging from sexual abuse at the age of 15, to the death of [[Nigel Preston]] (friend and former drummer for The Cult), to his directionless years spent in [[Glasgow]] in the late 1970s. But the record was barely noticed, only reaching US#69, and UK#21, and then quickly dropping out of sight. Reportedly it reached number one on the charts in [[Portugal]], but quickly dropped out of sight as well. The single \"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\" (UK#51) was released with the band going on tour in support of the new album. Only one more single, \"Star\" (UK#65), was officially released. That song began life in 1986 as \"Tom Petty\" before being dropped by the band during rehearsals. In 1993 the song was resurrected once again as \"Starchild\", and was finally completed for the record in 1994 as, just simply, \"Star\".\n\n\"Be Free\" was also released as a single both in [[Canada]], as a promotional CD with a purchase of a party pack of [[Labatt]] Genuine Draft, and in [[France]] by [[Virgin Records]] as an extremely rare edited version along with the edit of \"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\". \"Sacred Life\" was released as a promotional only single in [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]], and \"Saints are Down\" was released as a promotional single in [[Greece]].\n\n\"Gone\" was released as a limited edition (only 2000 made) 7 inch vinyl single with artwork and handwritten lyrics by [[Ian Astbury]].\n\nThe [[Australia]]n version contains an extra CD, with nine songs recorded live at the [[Marquee Club]] in [[London]] in November 1991.\n\n==Track listing==\nAll songs written by [[Ian Astbury]] and [[Billy Duffy]], unless otherwise stated.\n#\"Gone\" &ndash; 3:50\n#\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\" &ndash; 6:36\n#\"Real Grrrl\" &ndash; 4:25\n#\"Black Sun\" &ndash; 6:23\n#\"Naturally High\" &ndash; 4:23\n#\"Joy\" &ndash; 4:46\n#\"Star\" &ndash; 5:02\n#\"Sacred Life\" &ndash; 5:47\n#\"Be Free\" &ndash; 3:48\n#\"Universal You\" (Astbury, Duffy, [[Craig Adams (musician)|Craig Adams]]) &ndash; 5:17\n#\"Emperor's New Horse\" &ndash; 4:22\n#\"Saints are Down\" &ndash; 6:54\n\nThere is an advance [[Promotion (marketing)|promotional]] CD and [[cassette tape]] version, which uses [[unmastered]] versions of the tracks and slightly rearranges the track listing:{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\n#\"Gone\" &ndash; 3:46\n#\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\" &ndash; 6:12\n#\"Real Grrrl\" &ndash; 4:21\n#\"Black Sun\" &ndash; 6:16\n#\"Naturally High\" &ndash; 4:13\n#\"Emperor's New Horse\" &ndash; 4:17\n#\"Star\" &ndash; 4:57\n#\"Sacred Life\" &ndash; 5:39\n#\"Be Free\" &ndash; 3:44\n#\"Universal You\" (Astbury, Duffy, [[Craig Adams (musician)|Craig Adams]]) &ndash; 5:08\n#\"Joy\" &ndash; 4:44\n#\"Saints are Down\" &ndash; 6:48\n\n==Personnel==\n*[[Ian Astbury]] &ndash; [[vocals]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[guitar]], [[tambourine]]\n*[[Billy Duffy]] &ndash; [[guitar]]\n*[[Craig Adams (musician)|Craig Adams]] &ndash; [[bass guitar|bass]]\n*[[Scott Garrett (musician)|Scott Garrett]] &ndash; [[drum kit|drums]]\n\n===Additional personnel===\n*[[Scott Humphrey]] &ndash; [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], [[programming (music)|programming]]\n*Jim McGiueray &ndash; [[percussion instrument|percussion]]\n*[[Bob Rock]] &ndash; guitars, bass, keyboard &ndash; various tracks, [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixing]]\n*[[Mario Caldato, Jr.]] &ndash; mixing\n*George Marino (at Sterling Sound) &ndash; [[Audio mastering|mastering]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.the-cult.com/cult.html Official website album page]\n\n{{The Cult}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cult, The}}\n[[Category:1994 albums]]\n[[Category:The Cult albums]]\n[[Category:Albums produced by Bob Rock]]\n[[Category:Beggars Banquet Records albums]]\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2019}}\n{{About|the eponymous album by The Cult||The Cult (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{EngvarB|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Cult\n| type       = studio\n| artist     = [[The Cult]]\n| cover      = The Cult (Black Sheep) cover.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = {{start_date|df=y|1994|10|12}}\n| recorded   = 1993\u20131994\n| venue      =\n| studio     = Warehouse Studios, [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada\n| genre      = [[Alternative rock]],<ref>[https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/79261/The-Cult-The-Cult/ Sputnikmusic review]</ref> [[hard rock]], [[grunge]]\n| length     = 61:39\n| label      = [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]], [[Sire Records|Sire]]\n| producer   = [[Bob Rock]]\n| prev_title = [[Live Cult]]\n| prev_year  = 1993\n| next_title = [[High Octane Cult]]\n| next_year  = 1996\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n|rev1 = [[Allmusic]]\n|rev1score = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r207795|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic review]</ref>\n}}<!-- Automatically generated by DASHBot-->\n\n'''''The Cult''''' is the sixth studio album from [[England|English]] rock band, [[The Cult]].

He directed praise to the album's slower songs, particularly \"So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth\" and \"You'll Miss Me When I'm Not Around\", comparing the latter to songs by [['Til Tuesday]] and [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]].<ref name=\"The Independent rev\"/> [[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the \"prosaic, realistic and affecting\" lyrics throughout the album while questioning its concept and criticizing some of its \"musical experiments\" such as the chorus of \"4\u00c6M\" and the \"smeared\" vocals of \"New Gods\".<ref name=\"The Guardian rev\"/> Rhian Daly of ''[[NME]]'' expressed a similar opinion in regards to the album's concept, calling it \"fragmented ... rather than being a unifying thing to tie every song neatly together\", and praised ''Miss Anthropocene''{{'}}s mix of sounds, pointing to the \"eerie\" \"New Gods\" and \"intergalactic rave-pop\" of \"Violence\" as highlights while acclaiming the album's \"euphoric\" closer \"Idoru\".<ref name=\"NME rev\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Standard edition<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/miss-anthropocene/1487294744|title=Miss Anthropocene by Grimes|website=Apple Music|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| all_writing = [[Claire Boucher]], except where noted\n| title1 = So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth\n| note1 = Art Mix\n| length1 = 6:08\n| title2 = Darkseid\n| note2 = with \u6f58PAN; writers: Boucher, Pan Wei-Ju\n| length2 = 3:44\n| title3 = [[Delete Forever]]\n| length3 = 3:57\n| title4 = [[Violence (song)|Violence]]\n| note4 = with i_o; writers: Boucher, Garrett Lockhart\n| length4 = 3:40\n| title5 = 4\u00c6M\n| note5 = writers: Boucher, Ganesh Chandanshive, Siddharth-Garima, Sanjal Bhandari, Nasir Faraaz\n| length5 = 4:30\n| title6 = New Gods\n| note6 = producers: Boucher, [[Dan Carey (record producer)|Dan Carey]]\n| length6 = 3:15\n| title7 = [[My Name Is Dark]]\n| note7 = Art Mix\n| length7 = 5:56\n| title8 = You'll Miss Me When I'm Not Around\n| length8 = 2:41\n| title9 = Before the Fever\n| length9 = 3:37\n| title10 = Idoru\n| note10 = Art Mix\n| length10 = 7:12\n| total_length = 44:40\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Japanese CD edition bonus track<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diskunion.net/indiealt/ct/detail/AWS191115GRIMES|title=MISS ANTHROPOCENE / \u30df\u30b9\u30fb\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30dd\u30bb\u30f3/GRIMES/\u30b0\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0\u30b9\uff5cROCK / POPS / INDIE\uff5c\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af\u30e6\u30cb\u30aa\u30f3\uff65\u30aa\u30f3\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7|website=diskunion.net|language=ja|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| total_length = 50:15\n| title11 = [[We Appreciate Power]]\n| note11 = featuring [[Hana (American musician)|Hana]]; writers: Boucher, Hana Pestle, Chris Greatti\n| length11 = 5:35\n}}\n{{Track listing\n| headline = Deluxe digital version bonus tracks<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/ca/album/miss-anthropocene-deluxe/1488048682|title=Miss Anthropocene (Deluxe) by Grimes|website=Apple Music|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n| total_length = 67:08\n| title12 = So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth\n| note12 = Algorithm Mix\n| length12 = 3:52\n| title13 = [[Violence (song)|Violence]]\n| note13 = with i_o) (Club Mix\n| length13 = 4:12\n| title14 = [[My Name Is Dark]]\n| note14 = Algorithm Mix\n| length14 = 4:03\n| title15 = Idoru\n| note15 = Algorithm Mix\n| length15 = 4:46\n}}\n\n'''Notes'''\n* The vinyl version contains the \"algorithm mix\" versions of \"So Heavy I Fell Through the Earth\", \"My Name Is Dark\", and \"Idoru\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://4ad.com/|title=The official website for independent record label 4AD.|website=4AD|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tonedeaf.thebrag.com/grimes-miss-anthropocene-so-heavy/|title=Grimes releases cover, tracklist and release date for new album 'Miss Anthropocene'|website=Tone Deaf|last=Di Iorio|first=Michael|date=November 16, 2019|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n* \"You'll Miss Me When I'm Not Around\" and \"Before the Fever\" are stylized in [[sentence case]].\n* \"Idoru\" is stylized in [[all caps]].\n\n==Personnel==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Grimes (musician)|Grimes]] \u2013 vocals, production, engineering\n* i_o \u2013 production {{small|(track 4)}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2019/09/grimes-i_o-violence-video-watch/|title=Grimes Releases Video for New Song \"Violence\": Watch|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|last=Cook-Wilson|first=Winston|date=September 5, 2019|accessdate=November 18, 2019}}</ref>\n* Chris Greatti \u2013 production {{small|(track 11)}}<ref name=\"Chris Greatti\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/Bqx8Z--l9V2/|title=Chris Greatti on Instagram: \"N\u00fc @grimes opus \"We Appreciate Power\" out now!
