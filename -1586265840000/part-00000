via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up

degree to which the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain, but research has indicated that the [[Pharynx|pharynx]] reaches peak [[Viral load|viral load]] approximately four days after infection.<ref name=\"NaturePeakLoad\" /><ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in

unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> Bats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\"

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.

''Dive'' was released on November 8, 2011 by the label [[Ghostly International]] to mostly positive reviews from critics, and it landed on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s United States [[Top Dance/Electronic Albums]] and [[Top Heatseekers Albums]] charts.\n\n''Dive'' continues what a ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'' writer described as the formula of \"radar loops and Massive Attack beats\" from past Tycho albums and was also made with mostly [[music hardware|hardware]] and analog equipment like previous records of the project. However, there were also differences in terms of the vibe of ''Dive'' and how the album was made. Hansen switched from [[Cakewalk Sonar]] to [[REAPER]] for [[digital audio workstation]]-based arranging and mixing during production of ''Dive''. The LP was the first Tycho record to be made with [[outboard gear]] such as pre-amps, analog delay devices, and old digital reverb software, as well as use microphone-recorded acoustic instrumentation. The sound and vibe of the album was also considered more \"dynamic,\" \"multidimensional,\" and \"livelier\" than past Tycho records by reviewers.\n\n==Concept==\n''Dive'', according to Hansen, is a set of \"artifacts from a future which might have more in common with our past than our present.\"<ref>[http://ghostly.com/releases/dive \"Tycho presents Dive\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920053545/http://ghostly.com/releases/dive |date=2016-09-20 }}.

Taking around five years to produce and write, ''Dive'', according to Hansen, is a set of \"artifacts from a future which might have more in common with our past than our present.\" It is a [[hypnagogic pop]] [[balearic beat|balearic]] [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]] [[electronica]] record with a sound and style that was compared to the works of Scottish group [[Boards of Canada]] by multiple professional [[music journalist]]s. ''Dive'' was released on November 8, 2011 by the label [[Ghostly International]] to mostly positive reviews from critics, and it landed on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s United States [[Top Dance/Electronic Albums]] and [[Top Heatseekers Albums]] charts.\n\n''Dive'' continues what a ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'' writer described as the formula of \"radar loops and Massive Attack beats\" from past Tycho albums and was also made with mostly [[music hardware|hardware]] and analog equipment like previous records of the project. However, there were also differences in terms of the vibe of ''Dive'' and how the album was made. Hansen switched from [[Cakewalk Sonar]] to [[REAPER]] for [[digital audio workstation]]-based arranging and mixing during production of ''Dive''. The LP was the first Tycho record to be made with [[outboard gear]] such as pre-amps, analog delay devices, and old digital reverb software, as well as use microphone-recorded acoustic instrumentation. The sound and vibe of the album was also considered more \"dynamic,\" \"multidimensional,\" and \"livelier\" than past Tycho records by reviewers.\n\n==Concept==\n''Dive'', according to Hansen, is a set of \"artifacts from a future which might have more in common with our past than our present.\"<ref>[http://ghostly.com/releases/dive \"Tycho presents Dive\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160920053545/http://ghostly.com/releases/dive |date=2016-09-20 }}.

The car was normally sold in \u201cbare chassis\u201d form, giving rise to a wide range of possible body types, but [[coachwork]] appear usually to have been for two door sporting bodied cars.<ref>{{cite web| title=Motorbase, Amilcar C8| publisher=Classic Vehicles Limited| accessdate=2013-09-29| url=http://www.lezebre.eu/car/amilcar/photo%20gallery%20voiture%201200.htm}}</ref>\nApproximately 350 were made.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe C8 was the result of the manufacturer's wish, encouraged by the rising prosperity of the 1920s, to extend the Amilcar range upmarket.   Amilcar had already built its reputation and market share with smaller cars, and the C8 was its first eight-cylinder model.\n\n== Bodies ==\nThe usual range of body types could be fitted included sedans/saloons, coup\u00e9s and cabriolets.   The C8 was a substantial car, intended to compete against models such as the [[:it:Delage DS|Delage DS]] and the [[:de: Panhard & Levassor CS|Panhard & Levassor CS]].\n\n== Engine ==\nThe C8's straight-8 [[ohc]] engine had a capacity of 2330cc which placed it in the 13CV taxation class.   Maximum power was quoted at {{convert|58|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, achieved at 4,000 rpm.   The top speed will have depended on the weight and form of the body specified, but was quoted at 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph).\n\n== Running gear ==\nPower was delivered to the rear-wheels via a four speed manual gear box.   The suspension used traditional leaf springs all round.\n\n== Commercial ==\nHaving been conceived during a period of rising incomes, the C8 arrived in an over-supplied market place in a period of economic panic and stringency.   The engine acquired a reputation for unreliability.

The car was normally sold in \u201cbare chassis\u201d form, giving rise to a wide range of possible body types, but [[coachwork]] appear usually to have been for two door sporting bodied cars.<ref>{{cite web| title=Motorbase, Amilcar C8| publisher=Classic Vehicles Limited| accessdate=2013-09-29| url=http://www.lezebre.eu/car/amilcar/photo%20gallery%20voiture%201200.htm}}</ref>\nApproximately 350 were made.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe C8 was the result of the manufacturer\u2019s wish, encouraged by the rising prosperity of the 1920s, to extend the Amilcar range upmarket.   Amilcar had already built its reputation and market share with smaller cars, and the C8 was its first eight-cylinder model.\n\n== Bodies ==\nThe usual range of body types could be fitted included sedans/saloons, coup\u00e9s and cabriolets.   The C8 was a substantial car, intended to compete against models such as the [[:it:Delage DS|Delage DS]] and the [[:de: Panhard & Levassor CS|Panhard & Levassor CS]].\n\n== Engine ==\nThe C8\u2019s straight-8 [[ohc]] engine had a capacity of 2330cc which placed it in the 13CV taxation class.   Maximum power was quoted at {{convert|58|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, achieved at 4,000 rpm.   The top speed will have depended on the weight and form of the body specified, but was quoted at 120&nbsp;km/h (75&nbsp;mph).\n\n== Running gear ==\nPower was delivered to the rear-wheels via a four speed manual gear box.   The suspension used traditional leaf springs all round.\n\n== Commercial ==\nHaving been conceived during a period of rising incomes, the C8 arrived in an over-supplied market place in a period of economic panic and stringency.   The engine acquired a reputation for unreliability.   The manufacturer fought to gain market share with ungraded models such as the \u201dC8 bis\u201d and the \u201cCS8\u201d,  but the car was not a commercial success.   Amilcar abandoned the market segment, delisting the C8 towards the end of 1932.
