However, they failed to do so and they finished the season with a 9\u20137 record, which resulted in the Broncos missing postseason action on a tiebreaker.\n\n==Offseason==\nIn the [[2006 NFL Draft]], the Broncos traded their number 15 and 68 picks to select [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] at number 11. Their second pick was tight end [[Tony Scheffler]] from [[Western Michigan]]. They then used their next pick (acquired from the [[Washington Redskins]]) on [[Central Florida]] wide receiver [[Brandon Marshall]]. The rest of their picks included [[University of Louisville]] defensive end [[Elvis Dumervil]], [[University of Akron|Akron University]] wide receiver [[Domenik Hixon]], [[North Dakota]] guard [[Chris Kuper]], and [[Minnesota|University of Minnesota]] center [[Greg Eslinger]]. Denver also traded a second round pick for [[Green Bay Packers]] wide receiver [[Javon Walker]]. In another big move, they traded WR [[Ashley Lelie]] to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] and received no less than 3rd and 4th round draft picks. [[Mike Anderson (running back)|Mike Anderson]] and [[Trevor Pryce]] were both waived due to salary cap issues and were subsequently picked up by the [[Baltimore Ravens]].\n\n===NFL

The game was primarily a defensive battle, with only one touchdown scored in the entire game, and the Rams won 18\u201310. [[Jake Plummer]] struggled throughout the game, throwing 3 interceptions, losing a fumble, and being sacked 4 times, 2 of them by [[Leonard Little]]. [[Tatum Bell]] also lost a fumble, but ran for 103 yards. Rookie [[Mike Bell (running back)|Mike Bell]] ran for 58 yards and scored the only touchdown in the entire game late in the second quarter on a 1-yard run. Kicker [[Jeff Wilkins]] provided all of the scoring for the Rams, making 6 field goals, tying a franchise record, while running back [[Steven Jackson]] was one of the few bright spots for the Rams offense, running for 121 yards. The five turnovers by the Broncos was the most for them since the [[2000 NFL season|2000 season]].  The Broncos would start their season at 0\u20131.\n\n===Week 2: vs. Kansas City Chiefs===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Chiefs\n|R1=0||R2=3||R3=3||R4=0||R5=0||RT=6\n|Home='''Broncos'''\n|H1=0||H2=0||H3=3||H4=3||H5=3||HT=9\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nThe Broncos returned to [[INVESCO Field at Mile High]] in Week 2 for their home-opener against the division rival [[2006 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]. The game turned into another defensive battle, contrary to the typical shootouts the two teams usually have.  Not a single touchdown was scored by either team. The Broncos improved on their turnovers, however, with just 1 interception thrown by Jake Plummer, while the Chiefs gave up 2 fumbles. Tatum Bell and Mike Bell combined for 113 yards rushing, while Denver again gave up a 100-yard rusher, allowing [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] to rush for 126 yards. Neither quarterback was spectacular, both throwing for less than 200 yards. [[Javon Walker]] led all receivers with 79 yards. The game was tied 6\u20136 at the end of regulation, prompting an overtime in which a [[Jason Elam]] 39-yard field goal won the game for the Broncos. In 93 games between the two teams, it was both the first to never have a touchdown and also featured the lowest-ever score.<ref>[http://www.sportsline.com/nfl/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20060917_KC@DEN Sportsline.com  recap vs. Kansas City]</ref> It was also only the third time in franchise history that the Broncos did not commit a single penalty.\n\n===Week 3: at New England Patriots===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Broncos'''\n|R1=0||R2=10||R3=0||R4=7||RT=17\n|Home=Patriots\n|H1=0||H2=0||H3=0||H4=7||HT=7\n}}\n''at [[Gillette Stadium]], [[Foxboro, Massachusetts]]''\n\nThe Broncos traveled to [[Gillette Stadium]] to play the [[2006 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] during the Sunday night game on September 24. The game was a rematch of the divisional playoff game of the previous season in which the Broncos beat the Patriots and ended their record 10-game playoff winning streak.  The Broncos won 17\u20137, improving their record to 2\u20131.  The Broncos scored a 23-yard field goal (by kicker Jason Elam) and a touchdown in the second quarter (a 32-yard TD pass from QB Jake Plummer to Javon Walker). Plummer and Walker would hook up for another touchdown in the fourth quarter with an 83-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos held New England to only 50 yards on the ground, while Tatum Bell ran for 123 yards. The Patriots scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter when [[Tom Brady]] threw an 8-yard pass to [[Doug Gabriel]]. The Broncos became the first team since the 1942 [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920\u201359)|Chicago Cardinals]] to begin their season with 11 straight quarters without allowing their opponents to score a touchdown.\n\n===Week 4: Bye week===\nThe Broncos had a bye week, but moved into a first place tie in the division when the [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] lost to the Baltimore Ravens 16\u201313.\n\n===Week 5: vs. Baltimore Ravens===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Ravens\n|R1=3||R2=0||R3=0||R4=0||RT=3\n|Home='''Broncos'''\n|H1=0||H2=3||H3=0||H4=10||HT=13\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nThe [[Baltimore Ravens]] traveled to INVESCO Field at Mile High for [[Monday Night Football]] on October 9. The last time these two teams played, on December 11, 2005, the Broncos won 12\u201310.  The Broncos won 13\u20133 and improved to 3\u20131, still tied for first place in the division with the San Diego Chargers.\n\nThe Ravens got on the board first when [[Matt Stover]] kicked a 24-yard field goal, following a fumble by Broncos RB Tatum Bell. The Broncos responded with a 43-yard field goal of their own by Jason Elam.  The Ravens drove deep into Broncos territory late at the end of the first half, but that drive was thwarted as [[Steve McNair]] was intercepted by [[Champ Bailey]] in the end zone on a pass intended for [[Clarence Moore]].  The third quarter was scoreless as the defensive struggle continued.  The Broncos controlled the clock in the second half with the running game led by Tatum Bell, who atoned for his fumble in the first quarter by bouncing back with 92 yards rushing. Ravens QB McNair was intercepted again by [[Darrent Williams]], which led to a Jake Plummer to [[Rod Smith (wide receiver)|Rod Smith]] touchdown pass.  McNair was intercepted a third time, ending the Ravens' final drive, this time by [[Domonique Foxworth]].\n\n===Week 6: vs. Oakland Raiders===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Raiders\n|R1=0||R2=0||R3=3||R4=0||RT=3\n|Home='''Broncos'''\n|H1=7||H2=6||H3=0||H4=0||HT=13\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nThe [[2006 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] traveled to INVESCO Field at Mile High for [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]] on October 15. The Raiders arrived in Denver 0\u20134 while the Broncos began the game tied for first place in their division at 3\u20131.\n\nThis game was again primarily a defensive struggle. [[Oakland]] had two turnovers deep in Broncos territory, one an interception thrown by [[Andrew Walter]] that was picked off by [[Champ Bailey]], and another a fumble by [[LaMont Jordan]]. Neither team was able to do much on offense, with just 1 touchdown scored in the entire game (a run by [[Tatum Bell]]) and a total of 274 yards produced by the Raiders and 246 yards by Denver. The only turnover of the game by Denver came on a [[Darrent Williams]] fumble on a punt return early in the second half. [[Jason Elam]] succeeded on kicks from 51 and 22 yards, while [[Sebastian Janikowski]] scored the only points for Oakland on a 47-yard field goal in the third quarter. [[Randy Moss]] had 86 yards receiving, while [[Javon Walker]] had 75 yards. Both had 1 50+ yard catch to put their teams in scoring position. [[Tatum Bell]] was the leading rusher with 83 yards. With the win, the Broncos improved to 4\u20131.\n\nThe Broncos by this point had only allowed 1 touchdown in 52 opponent possessions. In this game they became the first team since the 1934 [[Detroit Lions]] to go five games while allowing only one touchdown to be scored against them.<ref>[http://www.sportsline.com/nfl/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20061015_OAK@DEN Sportsline.com recap vs. Oakland Raiders]</ref>\n\n===Week 7: at Cleveland Browns===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Broncos'''\n|R1=0||R2=10||R3=7||R4=0||RT=17\n|Home=Browns\n|H1=0||H2=0||H3=0||H4=7||HT=7\n}}\n''at [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]]''\n\nThe Broncos traveled to [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]] to face the [[Cleveland Browns]] in what would again be a primarily defensive struggle. The Broncos again had a 100-yard rusher in [[Tatum Bell]], with 115 yards (and also 1 touchdown), and also had a 100-yard receiver in [[Javon Walker]], with 107 yards. Former Bronco [[Reuben Droughns]] was held to just 33 yards rushing and 27 yards receiving (60 yards total). [[Jake Plummer]] again struggled, throwing 1 touchdown (to rookie [[Brandon Marshall]], the first of his career), but also 2 interceptions. Although Denver committed 2 turnovers, they also forced three; one interception (by [[Champ Bailey]], making it three consecutive games with an interception) and two fumbles. After Jake Plummer threw his second interception of the day in their own red zone, the Browns scored their only points when [[Charlie Frye]] threw a touchdown pass to [[Joe Jurevicius]] in the fourth quarter, only the second touchdown allowed by the Broncos all year. It also ended their second 11-quarter streak without a touchdown allowed of the season. Denver at the time had only allowed 44 points all season, the lowest in the league. However, in one of the few items of bad news for the Broncos, left tackle [[Matt Lepsis]] suffered a season-ending knee injury. Also, kicker [[Jason Elam]] missed just his second field goal of the season in the third quarter.\n\nAfter the Chargers lost to division rival Kansas CIty, the Broncos took over the AFC West with a 5\u20131 record.\n\n===Week 8: vs. Indianapolis Colts===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Colts'''\n|R1=3||R2=3||R3=14||R4=14||RT=34\n|Home=Broncos\n|H1=0||H2=14||H3=7||H4=10||HT=31\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nThe Broncos returned to [[INVESCO Field at Mile High]] in a highly anticipated showdown with the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and their high-powered offense led by [[Peyton Manning]]. Going into the game, Indianapolis was one of just two undefeated teams in the NFL (along with the [[Chicago Bears]]) with a 6\u20130 record.\n\nUnlike the other games the Broncos played up to this point, this game turned into a shootout in the second half, with Peyton Manning playing a nearly flawless game. By the end of the first half, the Broncos had already scored 14 points (3 below their season high up to this point). The Colts scored first, with a 42-yard field goal by [[Adam Vinatieri]] in the first quarter. The Broncos took a quick lead in the second quarter with two consecutive 80-yard drives for touchdowns; one a 1-yard run by [[Jake Plummer]], his first of the season on running, and the second a 15-yard pass to [[Javon Walker]]. The Broncos went into the half leading 14\u20136 after a 32-yard field goal by Vinatieri.\n\nThe Colts responded with a 12-yard touchdown catch by [[Reggie Wayne]] in the third quarter. The only turnover of the game came on a [[Jake Plummer]] fumble on the next drive by the Broncos, leading to another easy touchdown pass to Wayne, putting the Colts ahead 17\u201314. A touchdown run by [[Mike Bell (running back)|Mike Bell]], who was substituting for the slightly injured [[Tatum Bell]], put the Broncos on top again. Each team responded with a touchdown in the fourth quarter, with Bell running for another touchdown and Wayne hauling in another touchdown pass (followed by a 2-point conversion pass that was also caught by Wayne). The 37-yard field goal by Vinatieri with 2 seconds left won the game for the Colts, breaking the tie and allowing them to remain undefeated. He had another 48-yarder earlier in the quarter, while [[Jason Elam]] had previously tied the game on a 49-yard field goal.\n\nThe game proved to be good for both offenses; while Denver allowed the most points they had all season, they also scored more points than they had all season. Peyton Manning tore up the Broncos defense, throwing for 345 yards (138 by Wayne) on 32/39 passing, and 3 touchdowns (all to Wayne). Denver's powerful run attack (currently third in the league behind the [[Atlanta Falcons]] and [[San Diego Chargers]]) gained 227 yards against the league-worst Colts run defense (including 136 by rookie Mike Bell), but it simply wasn't enough to counter the Colts' powerful offense (which also ran for 93 yards, all by rookie [[Joseph Addai]], a career-high).\n\nDenver again moved into a first place tie in the AFC West with the San Diego Chargers as they won their game against the St. Louis Rams.\n\n===Week 9: at Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Broncos'''\n|R1=14||R2=0||R3=7||R4=10||RT=31\n|Home=Steelers\n|H1=0||H2=10||H3=7||H4=3||HT=20\n}}\n''at [[Heinz Field]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]''\n\nThe Broncos played the [[Super Bowl XL]] champion [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[Heinz Field]] in Pittsburgh, in a rematch of the 2005 AFC Championship Game.  The Broncos got on the scoreboard quick with Jake Plummer throwing a 16-yard touchdown strike to WR [[Rod Smith (wide receiver)|Rod Smith]] on their first drive of the game.  On the ensuing kickoff, the Steelers fumbled the ball, with the Broncos recovering deep into Steelers' territory.  Plummer then threw a 10-yard pass to WR [[Javon Walker]] to make the score 14\u20130. On the next drive, the Steelers got to the Denver 41-yard line when QB [[Ben Roethlisberger]] completed a 35-yard pass to WR [[Cedrick Wilson Sr.|Cedrick Wilson]], who then fumbled the ball and the Broncos recovered.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Steelers dominated play outscoring the Broncos 10\u20130 on the quarter.  Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB [[Willie Parker]] for his first touchdown pass of the game.  The Steelers were about to score on their next possession when Roethlisberger threw an interception near the end zone to CB [[Champ Bailey]].  After the Broncos showed no offense in the quarter, and the Steelers missed a 40-yard field goal, the quarter ended with the Steelers' Jeff Reed kicking a 46-yard field goal.\n\nIn the third quarter, Denver quickly scored with a 72-yard end around run by Javon Walker.  On their next drive, the Steelers were driving down the field, when Roethlisberger threw another interception to Champ Bailey near the end zone. Denver was unable to get out of their own end zone after that and punted to the Steelers, who scored on the next drive with a 3-yard touchdown run by Willie Parker.\n\nDenver put the game to an end in the fourth quarter with another 10-yard touchdown pass from Plummer to Walker.  This came after the Steelers punted from their own 1-yard line and the Broncos began the series on the Steelers' 17-yard line.  Both the Steelers and the Broncos scored field goals on their next possessions, the Steelers with a 29-yard field goal and Denver with a 32-yard field goal. Pittsburgh again, down by 11, nearly made it a 4-point game when WR [[Hines Ward]] leaped into the end zone, but fumbled from a [[John Lynch (American football)]] tackle, whereby the Broncos safety [[Curome Cox]] recovered the fumble.  On the Steelers next possession, Roethlisberger again threw an interception, this time to Curome Cox, ending the game.\n\nWith this win the Broncos remained tied with the Chargers in the AFC West with a 6\u20132 record.\n\n===Week 10: at Oakland Raiders===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Broncos'''\n|R1=7||R2=0||R3=0||R4=10||RT=17\n|Home=Raiders\n|H1=7||H2=6||H3=0||H4=0||HT=13\n}}\n''at [[McAfee Coliseum]], [[Oakland, California]]''\n\nFollowing their road victory over the Steelers, the Broncos flew to [[McAfee Coliseum]] for an AFC West rematch with the [[Oakland Raiders]].  In the first quarter, the Raiders score first with RB [[LaMont Jordan]] on a 1-yard TD run.  The Broncos would respond with QB [[Jake Plummer]] completing a 39-yard TD run with WR [[Javon Walker]].  In the second quarter, Oakland kicker [[Sebastian Janikowski]] would get a 55-yard and a 20-yard field goal to give the Raiders a 13\u20137 halftime lead.  After a scoreless third quarter, Denver would score twice in the 4th Quarter with Plummer's 1-yard TD pass to FB [[Kyle Johnson (American football)|Kyle Johnson]] and [[Jason Elam]] kicking a 24-yard field goal.  With the win, the Broncos improved to 7\u20132.\n\n===Week 11: vs. San Diego Chargers===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Chargers'''\n|R1=7||R2=0||R3=14||R4=14||RT=35\n|Home=Broncos\n|H1=0||H2=14||H3=10||H4=3||HT=27\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nFollowing their season sweep over the Raiders, the Broncos went home for a Sunday Night match-up with their AFC West rival, the [[San Diego Chargers]].  With first place in the division on the line, both sides would play tough.  In the first quarter, the Chargers got the only score of the period as [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] scored on a 3-yard TD run on a 98-yard drive.  In the second quarter, the Broncos took the lead with RB [[Mike Bell (running back)|Mike Bell]] getting two 3-yard TD runs.  In the third quarter, kicker [[Jason Elam]] completed a 42-yard field goal, while CB [[Darrent Williams]] returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown.\n\nHowever, things started getting grim as Tomlinson (who historically had difficulty against the Broncos in Denver) exploded with a 3-yard TD run and a 51-yard touchdown reception.  In the fourth quarter, Elam would get a 38-yard field goal, but San Diego managed to wrap up the game with QB [[Philip Rivers]] completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR [[Vincent Jackson]] and Tomlinson getting a 1-yard TD run.  With the loss, the Broncos fell to 7\u20133 and second place in the AFC West.\n\nIt would later be learned that safety [[Nick Ferguson]] had season-ending surgery to repair a torn medial meniscus in his left knee. He injured his knee after a 1st quarter interception.\n\n===Week 12: at Kansas City Chiefs===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Broncos\n|R1=0||R2=3||R3=7||R4=0||RT=10\n|Home='''Chiefs'''\n|H1=3||H2=7||H3=3||H4=6||HT=19\n}}\n''at [[Arrowhead Stadium]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]''\n\nThe Broncos traveled to [[Arrowhead Stadium]] for an AFC West rematch with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].  This was a historic game as [[NFL Network]] began their season with a 3rd NFL game on Thanksgiving.  In the 1960s, Kansas City hosted three Thanksgiving Day games.  For this battle, QB [[Jake Plummer|Jake \"The Snake\" Plummer]] was fighting for his starting job.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Broncos trailed early as K.C.'s [[Lawrence Tynes]] kicked a 24-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Denver's defensive problem continued as RB [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] got a 1-yard TD run.  The Broncos would finally score as kicker [[Jason Elam]] nailed a 31-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Tynes helped the Chiefs get a 34-yard field goal, while Plummer completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE [[Stephen Alexander (American football)|Stephen Alexander]].  In the fourth quarter, Tynes gave Kansas City a 29-yard and a 21-yard field goal.  The Broncos tried to respond, but K.C.'s improved defense stopped any hope of a comeback.  With the loss, Denver fell to 7\u20134.\n\n===Week 13: vs. Seattle Seahawks===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Seahawks'''\n|R1=0||R2=7||R3=0||R4=16||RT=23\n|Home=Broncos\n|H1=3||H2=10||H3=0||H4=7||HT=20\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nTrying to break a two-game losing streak, the Broncos went home for a Sunday Night fight with the [[Seattle Seahawks]].  This game would be notable for the NFL debut of QB [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]].  In the first quarter, the Broncos struck first with kicker [[Jason Elam]]'s 37-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Denver's lead increased with Cutler's 7-yard TD pass to TE [[Stephen Alexander (American football)|Stephen Alexander]].  However, the Seahawks got into game with DE [[Darryl Tapp]]'s 25-yard interception return for a touchdown.  After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle took control of the game with RB [[Shaun Alexander]]'s 1-yard TD run, along with kicker [[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]]'s 44-yard and 23-yard field goal.  The Broncos responded with a huge play, as Cutler completed a 71-yard TD pass to WR [[Brandon Marshall]].  However, Denver's defense couldn't hold off the Seahawks' response, as Brown nailed a 50-yard field goal, spoiling Cutler's debut.  With their third-straight loss, the Broncos fell to 7\u20135.\n\n===Week 14: at San Diego Chargers===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Broncos\n|R1=0||R2=3||R3=17||R4=0||RT=20\n|Home='''Chargers'''\n|H1=14||H2=14||H3=0||H4=20||HT=48\n}}\n''at [[Qualcomm Stadium]], [[San Diego, California]]''\n\nHoping to snap a three-game losing streak and give rookie QB [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] his first NFL win, the Broncos flew to [[Qualcomm Stadium]] for an AFC West rematch with the [[San Diego Chargers]].  In the first quarter, Denver trailed early as QB [[Philip Rivers]] completed a 12-yard TD pass to TE [[Antonio Gates]], while FB [[Lorenzo Neal]] got a 4-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Broncos managed to get on the board with kicker [[Jason Elam]]'s 34-yard field goal.  However, San Diego's dominance continued with RB [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]'s 1-yard TD run, along with a 7-yard TD pass from Rivers to Gates.  In the third quarter, the Broncos showed some signs of life as Cutler completed a 28-yard TD pass and an 11-yard TD pass to rookie TE [[Tony Scheffler]], while Elam nailed a 33-yard field goal.  However, in the fourth quarter, the Chargers pulled away with kicker [[Nate Kaeding]]'s 34-yard and 35-yard field goal, while Tomlinson broke the single-season TD record with a 6-yard and a 7-yard TD run.  With their fourth-straight defeat, Denver fell to 7\u20136.\n\n===Week 15: at Arizona Cardinals===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Broncos'''\n|R1=10||R2=6||R3=7||R4=14||RT=37\n|Home=Cardinals\n|H1=0||H2=10||H3=3||H4=7||HT=20\n}}\n''at [[University of Phoenix Stadium]], [[Glendale, Arizona]]''\n\nBroncos' fans were given several reasons to hope for the future during this road win against the similarly rookie quarterback led Cardinals. Denver scored first on a Javon Walker 54-yard pass from Jay Cutler in the 3rd minute of the first quarter. They scored again in the 6th minute of the first quarter on a 30-yard field goal compliments of Jason Elam. Elam tacked on another 3 in the second minute of the second quarter from 22 yards. The Cardinals got on the board in the 6th minute of the second quarter with a field goal from Neil Rackers. They scored again in the 7th minute on a fumble return for a touchdown by Antonio Smith for 4 yards after Tatum Bell lost the ball. Elam struck again from 30 yards in the 14th minute of the 2nd quarter. Denver went on to score 3 more TDs. One in the third on a 10-yard pass to Rod Smith and two more in the fourth both on 1-yard carries from Mike Bell. Arizona scored on an FG in the third from 38 yards compliments of Rackers and then on a touchdown in the fourth on a four-yard carry by [[Edgerrin James]]. The Broncos improved to 8\u20136 while the Cardinals fell to 4\u201310.\n\nPlay-off Implications: Jay Cutler replacing Jake Plummer for his third regular season start had an impressive game with 21 completions on 31 attempts for 261 yards total. He had two TD passes and 1 interception. The run game while not impressive by Broncos' standards (106 yards team total with Mike Bell leading Tatum Bell (28 yards), with 61 yards on 16 carries) did provide enough of a threat to allow Cutler opportunities to make plays. After the Broncos' relatively stagnant last four games any semblance of an offensive rhythm is encouraging. The win in Arizona kept Bronco play-off hopes alive and set up an exciting must-win situation against the Cincinnati Bengals in week 16. The Broncos can clinch a wild card playoff berth with a win against the Bengals and a loss by the KC Chiefs along with a loss by either the NY Jets or the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n===Week 16: vs. Cincinnati Bengals===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Bengals\n|R1=7||R2=10||R3=0||R4=6||RT=23\n|Home='''Broncos'''\n|H1=0||H2=14||H3=7||H4=3||HT=24\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nFollowing their road victory over the Cardinals, the Broncos went home for a snowy Christmas Eve fight with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].  In the first quarter, the Bengals struck first with RB [[Rudi Johnson]]'s 6-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Denver struck back with QB [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] completing a 1-yard TD pass to rookie TE [[Tony Scheffler]] and a 39-yard TD pass to WR [[Javon Walker]].  However, Cincinnati responded with kicker [[Shayne Graham]]'s 46-yard field goal and QB [[Carson Palmer]]'s 11-yard TD pass to WR [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]].  In the second half, the Broncos took the lead with RB [[Mike Bell (running back)|Mike Bell]]'s 2-yard TD run in the third quarter and kicker [[Jason Elam]]'s 24-yard field goal.  Late in the game, the Bengals almost tied the game with Palmer completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR [[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]].  Fortunately, a botched snap resulted in failed PAT, giving Denver a one-point win.  With the win, the Broncos improved to 9\u20136.\n\n===Week 17: vs. San Francisco 49ers===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''49ers'''\n|R1=0||R2=3||R3=14||R4=6||R5=3||RT=26\n|Home=Broncos\n|H1=3||H2=10||H3=3||H4=7||H5=0||HT=23\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nTo close off their season, the Broncos went into their last game of the regular season needing a win or a tie to make the playoffs.  Coach Mike Shanahan went on record as saying he preferred it that way\u2014he believed it would motivate his team to play well. Oddsmakers apparently believed so, too; the Broncos went in an 11-point favorite.\n\nDenver looked strong early and led the visiting 49ers 13\u20133 at halftime, but San Francisco used a stingy goal-line defense and a heavy dose of NFC rushing champ [[Frank Gore]] to take a lead late into the second half. Cornerback [[Darrent Williams]] (playing in what would tragically be his final game) also left the game in the second half due to a shoulder injury.  With just 90 seconds left on the clock, rookie QB Jay Cutler tossed a nine-yard touchdown to tie the game at 23.  Neither team managed another score in regulation, and the game went to overtime.\n\nThe overtime period consisted of classic field-position football, with San Francisco steadily gaining field position but losing the battle with the clock.  Despite two overtime possessions, Denver was unable to move the ball into field goal range.  The Broncos might have been able to hold out for a tie or buy their exhausted defense enough rest to make a difference had they managed the clock better.  Shanahan, however, either didn't think this would extend the team's season or wouldn't stoop to such tactics.  Finally, the 49ers' Joe Nedney attempted a 36-yard field goal with just under two minutes left.  He hooked it badly but the ball passed just inside the right goalpost, ending Denver's season.\n\nWith the loss, the Broncos dropped the record to 9\u20137 to finish the season.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe final record was 9\u20137, and the Broncos did not qualify for the Playoffs. On New Year's Day 2007, less than 12 hours after the last game ended, second-year cornerback [[Darrent Williams]] was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting. He was 24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_4931937 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427200547/http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_4931937 |archivedate=April 27, 2007  }}</ref>\n\n50 days after Williams died, running back [[Damien Nash]] died following a charity basketball game.\n\n[[Jake Plummer]] retired after being traded to the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] since [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] was the new starter in Denver.

However, they failed to do so and they finished the season with a 9\u20137 record, which resulted in the Broncos missing postseason action on a tiebreaker.\n\n==Offseason==\nIn the [[2006 NFL Draft]], the Broncos traded their number 15 and 68 picks to select [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] at number 11. Their second pick was tight end [[Tony Scheffler]] from [[Western Michigan]]. They then used their next pick (acquired from the [[Washington Redskins]]) on [[Central Florida]] wide receiver [[Brandon Marshall]]. The rest of their picks included [[University of Louisville]] defensive end [[Elvis Dumervil]], [[University of Akron|Akron University]] wide receiver [[Domenik Hixon]], [[North Dakota]] guard [[Chris Kuper]], and [[Minnesota|University of Minnesota]] center [[Greg Eslinger]]. Denver also traded a second round pick for [[Green Bay Packers]] wide receiver [[Javon Walker]]. In another big move, they traded WR [[Ashley Lelie]] to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] and received no less than 3rd and 4th round draft picks. [[Mike Anderson (running back)|Mike Anderson]] and [[Trevor Pryce]] were both waived due to salary cap issues and were subsequently picked up by the [[Baltimore Ravens]].\n\n===NFL

The game was primarily a defensive battle, with only one touchdown scored in the entire game, and the Rams won 18\u201310. [[Jake Plummer]] struggled throughout the game, throwing 3 interceptions, losing a fumble, and being sacked 4 times, 2 of them by [[Leonard Little]]. [[Tatum Bell]] also lost a fumble, but ran for 103 yards. Rookie [[Mike Bell (running back)|Mike Bell]] ran for 58 yards and scored the only touchdown in the entire game late in the second quarter on a 1-yard run. Kicker [[Jeff Wilkins]] provided all of the scoring for the Rams, making 6 field goals, tying a franchise record, while running back [[Steven Jackson]] was one of the few bright spots for the Rams offense, running for 121 yards. The five turnovers by the Broncos was the most for them since the [[2000 NFL season|2000 season]].  The Broncos would start their season at 0\u20131.\n\n===Week 2: vs. Kansas City Chiefs===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Chiefs\n|R1=0||R2=3||R3=3||R4=0||R5=0||RT=6\n|Home='''Broncos'''\n|H1=0||H2=0||H3=3||H4=3||H5=3||HT=9\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nThe Broncos returned to [[INVESCO Field at Mile High]] in Week 2 for their home-opener against the division rival [[2006 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]]. The game turned into another defensive battle, contrary to the typical shootouts the two teams usually have.  Not a single touchdown was scored by either team. The Broncos improved on their turnovers, however, with just 1 interception thrown by Jake Plummer, while the Chiefs gave up 2 fumbles. Tatum Bell and Mike Bell combined for 113 yards rushing, while Denver again gave up a 100-yard rusher, allowing [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] to rush for 126 yards. Neither quarterback was spectacular, both throwing for less than 200 yards. [[Javon Walker]] led all receivers with 79 yards. The game was tied 6\u20136 at the end of regulation, prompting an overtime in which a [[Jason Elam]] 39-yard field goal won the game for the Broncos. In 93 games between the two teams, it was both the first to never have a touchdown and also featured the lowest-ever score.<ref>[http://www.sportsline.com/nfl/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20060917_KC@DEN Sportsline.com  recap vs. Kansas City]</ref> It was also only the third time in franchise history that the Broncos did not commit a single penalty.\n\n===Week 3: at New England Patriots===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Broncos'''\n|R1=0||R2=10||R3=0||R4=7||RT=17\n|Home=Patriots\n|H1=0||H2=0||H3=0||H4=7||HT=7\n}}\n''at [[Gillette Stadium]], [[Foxboro, Massachusetts]]''\n\nThe Broncos traveled to [[Gillette Stadium]] to play the [[2006 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] during the Sunday night game on September 24. The game was a rematch of the divisional playoff game of the previous season in which the Broncos beat the Patriots and ended their record 10-game playoff winning streak.  The Broncos won 17\u20137, improving their record to 2\u20131.  The Broncos scored a 23-yard field goal (by kicker Jason Elam) and a touchdown in the second quarter (a 32-yard TD pass from QB Jake Plummer to Javon Walker). Plummer and Walker would hook up for another touchdown in the fourth quarter with an 83-yard touchdown pass. The Broncos held New England to only 50 yards on the ground, while Tatum Bell ran for 123 yards. The Patriots scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter when [[Tom Brady]] threw an 8-yard pass to [[Doug Gabriel]]. The Broncos became the first team since the 1942 [[Chicago Cardinals (NFL, 1920\u201359)|Chicago Cardinals]] to begin their season with 11 straight quarters without allowing their opponents to score a touchdown.\n\n===Week 4: Bye week===\nThe Broncos had a bye week, but moved into a first place tie in the division when the [[2006 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] lost to the Baltimore Ravens 16\u201313.\n\n===Week 5: vs. Baltimore Ravens===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Ravens\n|R1=3||R2=0||R3=0||R4=0||RT=3\n|Home='''Broncos'''\n|H1=0||H2=3||H3=0||H4=10||HT=13\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nThe [[Baltimore Ravens]] traveled to INVESCO Field at Mile High for [[Monday Night Football]] on October 9. The last time these two teams played, on December 11, 2005, the Broncos won 12\u201310.  The Broncos won 13\u20133 and improved to 3\u20131, still tied for first place in the division with the San Diego Chargers.\n\nThe Ravens got on the board first when [[Matt Stover]] kicked a 24-yard field goal, following a fumble by Broncos RB Tatum Bell. The Broncos responded with a 43-yard field goal of their own by Jason Elam.  The Ravens drove deep into Broncos territory late at the end of the first half, but that drive was thwarted as [[Steve McNair]] was intercepted by [[Champ Bailey]] in the end zone on a pass intended for [[Clarence Moore]].  The third quarter was scoreless as the defensive struggle continued.  The Broncos controlled the clock in the second half with the running game led by Tatum Bell, who atoned for his fumble in the first quarter by bouncing back with 92 yards rushing. Ravens QB McNair was intercepted again by [[Darrent Williams]], which led to a Jake Plummer to [[Rod Smith (wide receiver)|Rod Smith]] touchdown pass.  McNair was intercepted a third time, ending the Ravens' final drive, this time by [[Domonique Foxworth]].\n\n===Week 6: vs. Oakland Raiders===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Raiders\n|R1=0||R2=0||R3=3||R4=0||RT=3\n|Home='''Broncos'''\n|H1=7||H2=6||H3=0||H4=0||HT=13\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nThe [[2006 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] traveled to INVESCO Field at Mile High for [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]] on October 15. The Raiders arrived in Denver 0\u20134 while the Broncos began the game tied for first place in their division at 3\u20131.\n\nThis game was again primarily a defensive struggle. [[Oakland]] had two turnovers deep in Broncos territory, one an interception thrown by [[Andrew Walter]] that was picked off by [[Champ Bailey]], and another a fumble by [[LaMont Jordan]]. Neither team was able to do much on offense, with just 1 touchdown scored in the entire game (a run by [[Tatum Bell]]) and a total of 274 yards produced by the Raiders and 246 yards by Denver. The only turnover of the game by Denver came on a [[Darrent Williams]] fumble on a punt return early in the second half. [[Jason Elam]] succeeded on kicks from 51 and 22 yards, while [[Sebastian Janikowski]] scored the only points for Oakland on a 47-yard field goal in the third quarter. [[Randy Moss]] had 86 yards receiving, while [[Javon Walker]] had 75 yards. Both had 1 50+ yard catch to put their teams in scoring position. [[Tatum Bell]] was the leading rusher with 83 yards. With the win, the Broncos improved to 4\u20131.\n\nThe Broncos by this point had only allowed 1 touchdown in 52 opponent possessions. In this game they became the first team since the 1934 [[Detroit Lions]] to go five games while allowing only one touchdown to be scored against them.<ref>[http://www.sportsline.com/nfl/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20061015_OAK@DEN Sportsline.com recap vs. Oakland Raiders]</ref>\n\n===Week 7: at Cleveland Browns===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Broncos'''\n|R1=0||R2=10||R3=7||R4=0||RT=17\n|Home=Browns\n|H1=0||H2=0||H3=0||H4=7||HT=7\n}}\n''at [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]]''\n\nThe Broncos traveled to [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]] to face the [[Cleveland Browns]] in what would again be a primarily defensive struggle. The Broncos again had a 100-yard rusher in [[Tatum Bell]], with 115 yards (and also 1 touchdown), and also had a 100-yard receiver in [[Javon Walker]], with 107 yards. Former Bronco [[Reuben Droughns]] was held to just 33 yards rushing and 27 yards receiving (60 yards total). [[Jake Plummer]] again struggled, throwing 1 touchdown (to rookie [[Brandon Marshall]], the first of his career), but also 2 interceptions. Although Denver committed 2 turnovers, they also forced three; one interception (by [[Champ Bailey]], making it three consecutive games with an interception) and two fumbles. After Jake Plummer threw his second interception of the day in their own red zone, the Browns scored their only points when [[Charlie Frye]] threw a touchdown pass to [[Joe Jurevicius]] in the fourth quarter, only the second touchdown allowed by the Broncos all year. It also ended their second 11-quarter streak without a touchdown allowed of the season. Denver at the time had only allowed 44 points all season, the lowest in the league. However, in one of the few items of bad news for the Broncos, left tackle [[Matt Lepsis]] suffered a season-ending knee injury. Also, kicker [[Jason Elam]] missed just his second field goal of the season in the third quarter.\n\nAfter the Chargers lost to division rival Kansas CIty, the Broncos took over the AFC West with a 5\u20131 record.\n\n===Week 8: vs. Indianapolis Colts===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Colts'''\n|R1=3||R2=3||R3=14||R4=14||RT=34\n|Home=Broncos\n|H1=0||H2=14||H3=7||H4=10||HT=31\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nThe Broncos returned to [[INVESCO Field at Mile High]] in a highly anticipated showdown with the [[Indianapolis Colts]] and their high-powered offense led by [[Peyton Manning]]. Going into the game, Indianapolis was one of just two undefeated teams in the NFL (along with the [[Chicago Bears]]) with a 6\u20130 record.\n\nUnlike the other games the Broncos played up to this point, this game turned into a shootout in the second half, with Peyton Manning playing a nearly flawless game. By the end of the first half, the Broncos had already scored 14 points (3 below their season high up to this point). The Colts scored first, with a 42-yard field goal by [[Adam Vinatieri]] in the first quarter. The Broncos took a quick lead in the second quarter with two consecutive 80-yard drives for touchdowns; one a 1-yard run by [[Jake Plummer]], his first of the season on running, and the second a 15-yard pass to [[Javon Walker]]. The Broncos went into the half leading 14\u20136 after a 32-yard field goal by Vinatieri.\n\nThe Colts responded with a 12-yard touchdown catch by [[Reggie Wayne]] in the third quarter. The only turnover of the game came on a [[Jake Plummer]] fumble on the next drive by the Broncos, leading to another easy touchdown pass to Wayne, putting the Colts ahead 17\u201314. A touchdown run by [[Mike Bell (running back)|Mike Bell]], who was substituting for the slightly injured [[Tatum Bell]], put the Broncos on top again. Each team responded with a touchdown in the fourth quarter, with Bell running for another touchdown and Wayne hauling in another touchdown pass (followed by a 2-point conversion pass that was also caught by Wayne). The 37-yard field goal by Vinatieri with 2 seconds left won the game for the Colts, breaking the tie and allowing them to remain undefeated. He had another 48-yarder earlier in the quarter, while [[Jason Elam]] had previously tied the game on a 49-yard field goal.\n\nThe game proved to be good for both offenses; while Denver allowed the most points they had all season, they also scored more points than they had all season. Peyton Manning tore up the Broncos defense, throwing for 345 yards (138 by Wayne) on 32/39 passing, and 3 touchdowns (all to Wayne). Denver's powerful run attack (currently third in the league behind the [[Atlanta Falcons]] and [[San Diego Chargers]]) gained 227 yards against the league-worst Colts run defense (including 136 by rookie Mike Bell), but it simply wasn't enough to counter the Colts' powerful offense (which also ran for 93 yards, all by rookie [[Joseph Addai]], a career-high).\n\nDenver again moved into a first place tie in the AFC West with the San Diego Chargers as they won their game against the St. Louis Rams.\n\n===Week 9: at Pittsburgh Steelers===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Broncos'''\n|R1=14||R2=0||R3=7||R4=10||RT=31\n|Home=Steelers\n|H1=0||H2=10||H3=7||H4=3||HT=20\n}}\n''at [[Heinz Field]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]''\n\nThe Broncos played the [[Super Bowl XL]] champion [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[Heinz Field]] in Pittsburgh, in a rematch of the 2005 AFC Championship Game.  The Broncos got on the scoreboard quick with Jake Plummer throwing a 16-yard touchdown strike to WR [[Rod Smith (wide receiver)|Rod Smith]] on their first drive of the game.  On the ensuing kickoff, the Steelers fumbled the ball, with the Broncos recovering deep into Steelers' territory.  Plummer then threw a 10-yard pass to WR [[Javon Walker]] to make the score 14\u20130. On the next drive, the Steelers got to the Denver 41-yard line when QB [[Ben Roethlisberger]] completed a 35-yard pass to WR [[Cedrick Wilson Sr.|Cedrick Wilson]], who then fumbled the ball and the Broncos recovered.\n\nIn the second quarter, the Steelers dominated play outscoring the Broncos 10\u20130 on the quarter.  Roethlisberger threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to RB [[Willie Parker]] for his first touchdown pass of the game.  The Steelers were about to score on their next possession when Roethlisberger threw an interception near the end zone to CB [[Champ Bailey]].  After the Broncos showed no offense in the quarter, and the Steelers missed a 40-yard field goal, the quarter ended with the Steelers' Jeff Reed kicking a 46-yard field goal.\n\nIn the third quarter, Denver quickly scored with a 72-yard end around run by Javon Walker.  On their next drive, the Steelers were driving down the field, when Roethlisberger threw another interception to Champ Bailey near the end zone. Denver was unable to get out of their own end zone after that and punted to the Steelers, who scored on the next drive with a 3-yard touchdown run by Willie Parker.\n\nDenver put the game to an end in the fourth quarter with another 10-yard touchdown pass from Plummer to Walker.  This came after the Steelers punted from their own 1-yard line and the Broncos began the series on the Steelers' 17-yard line.  Both the Steelers and the Broncos scored field goals on their next possessions, the Steelers with a 29-yard field goal and Denver with a 32-yard field goal. Pittsburgh again, down by 11, nearly made it a 4-point game when WR [[Hines Ward]] leaped into the end zone, but fumbled from a [[John Lynch (American football)]] tackle, whereby the Broncos safety [[Curome Cox]] recovered the fumble.  On the Steelers next possession, Roethlisberger again threw an interception, this time to Curome Cox, ending the game.\n\nWith this win the Broncos remained tied with the Chargers in the AFC West with a 6\u20132 record.\n\n===Week 10: at Oakland Raiders===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Broncos'''\n|R1=7||R2=0||R3=0||R4=10||RT=17\n|Home=Raiders\n|H1=7||H2=6||H3=0||H4=0||HT=13\n}}\n''at [[McAfee Coliseum]], [[Oakland, California]]''\n\nFollowing their road victory over the Steelers, the Broncos flew to [[McAfee Coliseum]] for an AFC West rematch with the [[Oakland Raiders]].  In the first quarter, the Raiders score first with RB [[LaMont Jordan]] on a 1-yard TD run.  The Broncos would respond with QB [[Jake Plummer]] completing a 39-yard TD run with WR [[Javon Walker]].  In the second quarter, Oakland kicker [[Sebastian Janikowski]] would get a 55-yard and a 20-yard field goal to give the Raiders a 13\u20137 halftime lead.  After a scoreless third quarter, Denver would score twice in the 4th Quarter with Plummer's 1-yard TD pass to FB [[Kyle Johnson (American football)|Kyle Johnson]] and [[Jason Elam]] kicking a 24-yard field goal.  With the win, the Broncos improved to 7\u20132.\n\n===Week 11: vs. San Diego Chargers===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Chargers'''\n|R1=7||R2=0||R3=14||R4=14||RT=35\n|Home=Broncos\n|H1=0||H2=14||H3=10||H4=3||HT=27\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nFollowing their season sweep over the Raiders, the Broncos went home for a Sunday Night match-up with their AFC West rival, the [[San Diego Chargers]].  With first place in the division on the line, both sides would play tough.  In the first quarter, the Chargers got the only score of the period as [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] scored on a 3-yard TD run on a 98-yard drive.  In the second quarter, the Broncos took the lead with RB [[Mike Bell (running back)|Mike Bell]] getting two 3-yard TD runs.  In the third quarter, kicker [[Jason Elam]] completed a 42-yard field goal, while CB [[Darrent Williams]] returned an interception 31 yards for a touchdown.\n\nHowever, things started getting grim as Tomlinson (who historically had difficulty against the Broncos in Denver) exploded with a 3-yard TD run and a 51-yard touchdown reception.  In the fourth quarter, Elam would get a 38-yard field goal, but San Diego managed to wrap up the game with QB [[Philip Rivers]] completing a 5-yard TD pass to WR [[Vincent Jackson]] and Tomlinson getting a 1-yard TD run.  With the loss, the Broncos fell to 7\u20133 and second place in the AFC West.\n\nIt would later be learned that safety [[Nick Ferguson]] had season-ending surgery to repair a torn medial meniscus in his left knee. He injured his knee after a 1st quarter interception.\n\n===Week 12: at Kansas City Chiefs===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Broncos\n|R1=0||R2=3||R3=7||R4=0||RT=10\n|Home='''Chiefs'''\n|H1=3||H2=7||H3=3||H4=6||HT=19\n}}\n''at [[Arrowhead Stadium]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]]''\n\nThe Broncos traveled to [[Arrowhead Stadium]] for an AFC West rematch with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].  This was a historic game as [[NFL Network]] began their season with a 3rd NFL game on Thanksgiving.  In the 1960s, Kansas City hosted three Thanksgiving Day games.  For this battle, QB [[Jake Plummer|Jake \"The Snake\" Plummer]] was fighting for his starting job.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Broncos trailed early as K.C.'s [[Lawrence Tynes]] kicked a 24-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Denver's defensive problem continued as RB [[Larry Johnson (running back)|Larry Johnson]] got a 1-yard TD run.  The Broncos would finally score as kicker [[Jason Elam]] nailed a 31-yard field goal.  In the third quarter, Tynes helped the Chiefs get a 34-yard field goal, while Plummer completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE [[Stephen Alexander (American football)|Stephen Alexander]].  In the fourth quarter, Tynes gave Kansas City a 29-yard and a 21-yard field goal.  The Broncos tried to respond, but K.C.'s improved defense stopped any hope of a comeback.  With the loss, Denver fell to 7\u20134.\n\n===Week 13: vs. Seattle Seahawks===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Seahawks'''\n|R1=0||R2=7||R3=0||R4=16||RT=23\n|Home=Broncos\n|H1=3||H2=10||H3=0||H4=7||HT=20\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nTrying to break a two-game losing streak, the Broncos went home for a Sunday Night fight with the [[Seattle Seahawks]].  This game would be notable for the NFL debut of QB [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]].  In the first quarter, the Broncos struck first with kicker [[Jason Elam]]'s 37-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, Denver's lead increased with Cutler's 7-yard TD pass to TE [[Stephen Alexander (American football)|Stephen Alexander]].  However, the Seahawks got into game with DE [[Darryl Tapp]]'s 25-yard interception return for a touchdown.  After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle took control of the game with RB [[Shaun Alexander]]'s 1-yard TD run, along with kicker [[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]]'s 44-yard and 23-yard field goal.  The Broncos responded with a huge play, as Cutler completed a 71-yard TD pass to WR [[Brandon Marshall]].  However, Denver's defense couldn't hold off the Seahawks' response, as Brown nailed a 50-yard field goal, spoiling Cutler's debut.  With their third-straight loss, the Broncos fell to 7\u20135.\n\n===Week 14: at San Diego Chargers===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Broncos\n|R1=0||R2=3||R3=17||R4=0||RT=20\n|Home='''Chargers'''\n|H1=14||H2=14||H3=0||H4=20||HT=48\n}}\n''at [[Qualcomm Stadium]], [[San Diego, California]]''\n\nHoping to snap a three-game losing streak and give rookie QB [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] his first NFL win, the Broncos flew to [[Qualcomm Stadium]] for an AFC West rematch with the [[San Diego Chargers]].  In the first quarter, Denver trailed early as QB [[Philip Rivers]] completed a 12-yard TD pass to TE [[Antonio Gates]], while FB [[Lorenzo Neal]] got a 4-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Broncos managed to get on the board with kicker [[Jason Elam]]'s 34-yard field goal.  However, San Diego's dominance continued with RB [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]'s 1-yard TD run, along with a 7-yard TD pass from Rivers to Gates.  In the third quarter, the Broncos showed some signs of life as Cutler completed a 28-yard TD pass and an 11-yard TD pass to rookie TE [[Tony Scheffler]], while Elam nailed a 33-yard field goal.  However, in the fourth quarter, the Chargers pulled away with kicker [[Nate Kaeding]]'s 34-yard and 35-yard field goal, while Tomlinson broke the single-season TD record with a 6-yard and a 7-yard TD run.  With their fourth-straight defeat, Denver fell to 7\u20136.\n\n===Week 15: at Arizona Cardinals===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Broncos'''\n|R1=10||R2=6||R3=7||R4=14||RT=37\n|Home=Cardinals\n|H1=0||H2=10||H3=3||H4=7||HT=20\n}}\n''at [[University of Phoenix Stadium]], [[Glendale, Arizona]]''\n\nBroncos' fans were given several reasons to hope for the future during this road win against the similarly rookie quarterback led Cardinals. Denver scored first on a Javon Walker 54-yard pass from Jay Cutler in the 3rd minute of the first quarter. They scored again in the 6th minute of the first quarter on a 30-yard field goal compliments of Jason Elam. Elam tacked on another 3 in the second minute of the second quarter from 22 yards. The Cardinals got on the board in the 6th minute of the second quarter with a field goal from Neil Rackers. They scored again in the 7th minute on a fumble return for a touchdown by Antonio Smith for 4 yards after Tatum Bell lost the ball. Elam struck again from 30 yards in the 14th minute of the 2nd quarter. Denver went on to score 3 more TDs. One in the third on a 10-yard pass to Rod Smith and two more in the fourth both on 1-yard carries from Mike Bell. Arizona scored on an FG in the third from 38 yards compliments of Rackers and then on a touchdown in the fourth on a four-yard carry by [[Edgerrin James]]. The Broncos improved to 8\u20136 while the Cardinals fell to 4\u201310.\n\nPlay-off Implications: Jay Cutler replacing Jake Plummer for his third regular season start had an impressive game with 21 completions on 31 attempts for 261 yards total. He had two TD passes and 1 interception. The run game while not impressive by Broncos' standards (106 yards team total with Mike Bell leading Tatum Bell (28 yards), with 61 yards on 16 carries) did provide enough of a threat to allow Cutler opportunities to make plays. After the Broncos' relatively stagnant last four games any semblance of an offensive rhythm is encouraging. The win in Arizona kept Bronco play-off hopes alive and set up an exciting must-win situation against the Cincinnati Bengals in week 16. The Broncos can clinch a wild card playoff berth with a win against the Bengals and a loss by the KC Chiefs along with a loss by either the NY Jets or the Jacksonville Jaguars.\n\n===Week 16: vs. Cincinnati Bengals===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Bengals\n|R1=7||R2=10||R3=0||R4=6||RT=23\n|Home='''Broncos'''\n|H1=0||H2=14||H3=7||H4=3||HT=24\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nFollowing their road victory over the Cardinals, the Broncos went home for a snowy Christmas Eve fight with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].  In the first quarter, the Bengals struck first with RB [[Rudi Johnson]]'s 6-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, Denver struck back with QB [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] completing a 1-yard TD pass to rookie TE [[Tony Scheffler]] and a 39-yard TD pass to WR [[Javon Walker]].  However, Cincinnati responded with kicker [[Shayne Graham]]'s 46-yard field goal and QB [[Carson Palmer]]'s 11-yard TD pass to WR [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]].  In the second half, the Broncos took the lead with RB [[Mike Bell (running back)|Mike Bell]]'s 2-yard TD run in the third quarter and kicker [[Jason Elam]]'s 24-yard field goal.  Late in the game, the Bengals almost tied the game with Palmer completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR [[T. J. Houshmandzadeh]].  Fortunately, a botched snap resulted in failed PAT, giving Denver a one-point win.  With the win, the Broncos improved to 9\u20136.\n\n===Week 17: vs. San Francisco 49ers===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''49ers'''\n|R1=0||R2=3||R3=14||R4=6||R5=3||RT=26\n|Home=Broncos\n|H1=3||H2=10||H3=3||H4=7||H5=0||HT=23\n}}\n''at [[Invesco Field at Mile High]], [[Denver, Colorado]]''\n\nTo close off their season, the Broncos went into their last game of the regular season needing a win or a tie to make the playoffs.  Coach Mike Shanahan went on record as saying he preferred it that way\u2014he believed it would motivate his team to play well. Oddsmakers apparently believed so, too; the Broncos went in an 11-point favorite.\n\nDenver looked strong early and led the visiting 49ers 13\u20133 at halftime, but San Francisco used a stingy goal-line defense and a heavy dose of NFC rushing champ [[Frank Gore]] to take a lead late into the second half. Cornerback [[Darrent Williams]] (playing in what would tragically be his final game) also left the game in the second half due to a shoulder injury.  With just 90 seconds left on the clock, rookie QB Jay Cutler tossed a nine-yard touchdown to tie the game at 23.  Neither team managed another score in regulation, and the game went to overtime.\n\nThe overtime period consisted of classic field-position football, with San Francisco steadily gaining field position but losing the battle with the clock.  Despite two overtime possessions, Denver was unable to move the ball into field goal range.  The Broncos might have been able to hold out for a tie or buy their exhausted defense enough rest to make a difference had they managed the clock better.  Shanahan, however, either didn't think this would extend the team's season or wouldn't stoop to such tactics.  Finally, the 49ers' Joe Nedney attempted a 36-yard field goal with just under two minutes left.  He hooked it badly but the ball passed just inside the right goalpost, ending Denver's season.\n\nWith the loss, the Broncos dropped the record to 9\u20137 to finish the season.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe final record was 9\u20137, and the Broncos did not qualify for the Playoffs. On New Year's Day 2007, less than 12 hours after the last game ended, second-year cornerback [[Darrent Williams]] was shot and killed in a drive-by shooting. He was 24.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_4931937 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 2, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427200547/http://www.denverpost.com/broncos/ci_4931937 |archivedate=April 27, 2007  }}</ref>\n\n50 days after Williams died, running back [[Damien Nash]] died following a charity basketball game.\n\n[[Jake Plummer]] retired after being traded to the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] since [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] was the new starter in Denver.
