Except a period at [[Walter Lantz Productions]] in the 1950s, Patterson would continue to work for Hanna and Barbera until the 1980s.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Long plot|date=February 2010}}\nTom pursues Jerry through a [[Basement|cellar]], but the mouse successfully dives into his mousehole. Tom peers into the hole, and Jerry launches a tomato from a [[mousetrap]] into his face. Jerry then climbs up the wall and grabs a handful of eggs from a carton marked \"Hen-Grenades\". As Tom wipes the tomato off his face, he is promptly covered in egg, with one hit to the eye leaving the effect of him wearing a [[monocle]]. Jerry shoots off the corks from a [[Champagne (wine)|champagne]] case, knocking Tom into a tub of water with only a pot to keep him afloat. The mouse promptly launches a brick from a spatula, sinking both the pot and Tom. Leading to the 1st war [[Message|communiqu\u00e9]] message, it reads \"[[Sighted sub, sank same|Sighted cat \u2013 sank same]]. Signed, [[Lieutenant|Lt]]. Jerry Mouse.\"\n\nLater, Tom approaches Jerry's mousehole with a cheese and a [[mallet]] in his hand, while Jerry uses a pipe as a makeshift [[periscope]] to observe; spotting this trap, Jerry instead opens the [[ironing board]] cupboard, sending the board crashing onto Tom's head. Jerry charges down the board on a [[jeep]] made from a [[Grater|cheese grater]] attached to a [[roller skate]], tearing Tom's fur as he speeds past twice, after which the jeep crashes into a wall, sending a sack of flour tumbling down. Adapting quickly to the situation, Jerry grabs the sack and spreads a makeshift flour [[smoke screen|smokescreen]], which blocks Tom's vision but not Jerry's. He smacks the nearly blind Tom in the rear with a board three times, but eventually Tom falls to the ground facing the mouse; Jerry slaps Tom a fourth time before the cat can do anything and then runs for it.<ref name=cartoonresearch/>\n\nTom, now wearing a bowl as an improvised [[Combat helmet|helmet]], throws a stick of [[dynamite]] towards Jerry, who immediately throws it back to Tom; this continues until Jerry performs [[reverse psychology]] by taking it from Tom, provoking the cat to steal it back and this new cycle to continue until Jerry leaves Tom to witlessly hold the stick, which explodes. Jerry jumps into a [[Kettle|tea kettle]] to escape the cat's wrath, but Tom sees him and throws another [[firecracker]] into the kettle; Jerry panics, but the oxygen has run out and the mouse escapes through the spout with no explosion. The puzzled cat opens the kettle's lid and sticks his entire head in just as the firecracker goes off, making him like a sunflower (the sunflower gag was removed on [[Cartoon Network]] in the late 1990s and early 2000s due to the short\u2019s blackface reference).\n\nContinuing his attempts to blow up the mouse, Tom launches a [[Paper plane]] with a firecracker hidden on top, but Jerry blows it back beneath Tom, who barely spots the firecracker before it goes off and is again black in the face. Jerry then plants an enormous stick of dynamite behind Tom; the cat sees it and screams in terror until the cracker splits into successively smaller sticks, ending with a minuscule replica of the original firecracker. Tom laughs, believing this to be harmless, but the dynamite explodes powerfully.\n\nJerry then goes through a hole in a barrel and jumps into a makeshift plane fashioned from an [[egg carton]] (launched from a slingshot made from a rubber band). He drops a succession of [[incandescent light bulb|light bulbs]], one of which hits Tom's head, and a banana bomb, which hits Tom's face. Tom grabs a [[Roman candle (firework)|Roman candle]] and skillfully shoots down Jerry's now weaponless plane, piece by piece. Jerry uses a [[brassiere]] to [[parachute]] from the plane, but is again shot down by Tom. Jerry races into his mousehole to escape, but Tom pushes another Roman candle into the hole and fires off six shots.\n\nThe fireballs pursue Jerry through the mouse hole through the barrel going back and forth until he eventually he leads them into a hose, which he shoots like a [[machine gun]] into a barrel where Tom is hiding. The barrel explodes, leaving Tom riding the remaining parts of the barrel like a [[bicycle]], which then crashes into the wall. Recovering, Tom fires a [[Tranquillizer gun|dart gun]] at Jerry, which hits him on the tail as he again attempts to dive into his mousehole.\n\nTom grabs Jerry and ties him to an ignited [[rocket]]; Jerry pretends to help himself be tied up, but tricks Tom into strapping his own hands to the rocket. Jerry emerges from the ropes, and Tom does not realize what has happened until Jerry waves at him. Tom fails to blow out the fuse, and the rocket shoots high into the sky and explodes. The explosion forms the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]]. Jerry proudly salutes the flag, and a final war communiqu\u00e9 is displayed, which reads \"[[Battle of Wake Island#First landing attempt|SEND MORE CATS]]!\" signed by Jerry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/mgms-the-yankee-doodle-mouse-1942/|title=MGM\u2019s \u201cThe Yankee Doodle Mouse\u201d (1943) &#124;|website=cartoonresearch.com}}</ref>\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[William Hanna]] as Tom (uncredited)\n\n==Crew==\n*Directed by: William Hanna and Joseph Barbera\n*Story: William Hanna, Joseph Barbera, Bill Turner, Tedd Pierce\n*Director of Animation: William Bowsky\n*Animation: Irven Spence, Pete Burness, George Gordon, Kenneth Muse, William Bowsky, Ruesen Grossman\n*Additional Animation: Jack Zander, Ray Patterson\n*Assistant Animation: Barney Posner\n*Effects Animation: Al Grandmain, Stan Quackenbush\n*Layout: Harvey Eisenberg\n*Backgrounds: John Didrik Johnsen\n*Sequence Director: Dave Fleischer\n*Music: Scott Bradley\n*Co-Producer: William Hanna\n*Produced by: Fred Quimby\n\n==Availability==\n;VHS:\n*''Tom & Jerry's 50th Birthday Classics''<ref>{{cite web |title=..:: The Tom and Jerry Online :: An Unofficial Site : TOM AND JERRY DVD/VHS::.. |url=http://www.tomandjerryonline.com/dvdvhs_view.cfm?id=3 |website=www.tomandjerryonline.com |accessdate=14 February 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n;Laserdisc:\n*''Tom & Jerry Classics''<ref>{{cite web |title=LaserDisc Database - Tom & Jerry Classics [ML102219] |url=https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/03371/ML102219/Tom-amp;-Jerry-Classics |website=www.lddb.com |accessdate=14 February 2020}}</ref>\n*''The Art of Tom & Jerry'' Vol. 1, Side 2<ref>{{cite web |title=LaserDisc Database - Art of Tom & Jerry, The: Volume I [ML102682] |url=https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/20511/ML102682/Art-of-Tom-amp;-Jerry-The:-Volume-I |website=www.lddb.com |accessdate=14 February 2020}}</ref>\n;DVD:\n*''[[Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection]]'' Vol. 1, Disc 1\n*''[[Tom and Jerry: The Deluxe Anniversary Collection]]'' Disc 1\n*''[[Tom and Jerry Golden Collection]]'' Vol. 1, Disc 1\n;Blu-ray:\n*''[[Tom and Jerry Golden Collection]]'' Vol. 1, Disc 1\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{bcdb title|4969}}\n*{{IMDb title|36547}}\n\n{{The Hanna-Barbera Tom and Jerry shorts}}\n{{AcademyAwardBestAnimatedShortFilm 1941\u20131960}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Yankee Doodle Mouse, The}}\n[[Category:1943 films]]\n[[Category:1943 animated films]]\n[[Category:1940s American animated films]]\n[[Category:1940s animated short films]]\n[[Category:1940s comedy films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American World War II propaganda shorts]]\n[[Category:Best Animated Short Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Short films directed by Joseph Barbera]]\n[[Category:Short films directed by William Hanna]]\n[[Category:Films featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer animated short films]]\n[[Category:Tom and Jerry short films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Scott Bradley]]\n[[Category:Films without speech]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|1943 film by directed by Joseph Barbera and William Hanna}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{Infobox film\n|name=The Yankee Doodle Mouse\n|image=Yankee Doodle Mouse Poster.jpg\n|caption=Theatrical poster\n|director=[[William Hanna]]<br/>[[Joseph Barbera]]\n|story=William Hanna (unc.)<br>Joseph Barbera (unc.)\n|animator=[[Irven Spence]]<br>[[Pete Burness]]<br>[[Kenneth Muse]]<br>[[George Gordon (animator)|George Gordon]]''<br>'''Additional animation:'''<br>[[Jack Zander]]<br>[[Ray Patterson (animator)|Ray Patterson]]<br>'''Assistant animation''':<br> [[Barney Posner]] (uncredited)<br>'''Effects animation:'''<br>Al Grandmain (uncredited)<ref name=cartoonresearch>{{cite web|url=http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/mgms-the-yankee-doodle-mouse-1942/|title=MGM\u2019s \u201cThe Yankee Doodle Mouse\u201d (1943)|publisher=Cartoon Research|date=July 6, 2016|accessdate=September 17, 2017}}</ref>\n|layout_artist=[[Harvey Eisenberg]]\n|starring=[[William Hanna]] (uncredited)\n|music=[[Scott Bradley (composer)|Scott Bradley]] \n|producer=[[Fred Quimby]] (unc. on original issue)\n|distributor=[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|released={{Film date|1943|6|26| |1950|6|24|re-release}}\n|color_process=[[Technicolor]]\n|runtime=7:28 (reissue version)\n|language=''no spoken dialogue''\n}}\n\n'''''The Yankee Doodle Mouse''''' is a 1943 American one-reel [[animated cartoon]] in [[Technicolor]].
