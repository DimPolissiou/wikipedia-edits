Essai sur Sigmund Freud}}) is a 1965 book about [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], by the French philosopher [[Paul Ric\u0153ur]]. In ''Freud and Philosophy'', Ric\u0153ur interprets Freud's work in terms of [[hermeneutics]], the theory of the rules that govern the interpretation of a particular text, and discusses [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], a school of philosophy founded by [[Edmund Husserl]]. He addresses questions such as the nature of interpretation in psychoanalysis, the understanding of human nature to which it leads, and the relationship between Freud's interpretation of culture and other interpretations. The book was first published in France by [[\u00c9ditions du Seuil]], and in the United States by [[Yale University Press]].\n\nRic\u0153ur explores what he considers a tension in Freud's work between an emphasis on \"energetics\", which explains psychological phenomena in terms of quantities of energy, and an emphasis on hermeneutics. He compares Freud to the philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], describing the trio as a \"[[Hermeneutics of suspicion|school of suspicion]]\", and explores similarities and differences between psychoanalysis and phenomenology. He also compares Freud's ideas to those of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], criticizes [[Sigmund Freud's views on religion|Freud's views on religion]], discusses [[language]], and further develops ideas about [[symbol]]s explored in his earlier work ''The Symbolism of Evil'' (1960). In response to criticism of the scientific status of psychoanalysis by philosophers such as [[Ernest Nagel]], Ric\u0153ur argues that psychoanalysis should be understood not as an observational science, but as an \"interpretation\" that resembles [[history]] rather than [[psychology]]. He criticizes psychoanalysts for failing to adopt this as their response to arguments that psychoanalysis is unscientific.\n\nOne of Ric\u0153ur's most noted works, ''Freud and Philosophy'' has been compared to the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' (1955), the classicist [[Norman O. Brown]]'s ''[[Life Against Death]]'' (1959), the sociologist [[Philip Rieff]]'s ''[[Freud: The Mind of the Moralist]]'' (1959), and the philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]'s ''[[Knowledge and Human Interests]]'' (1968). Commentators have praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of [[Freud's psychoanalytic theories|Freud's theories]], his exploration of usually neglected aspects of Freud's work, his comparison of Freud to Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche, and his discussion of phenomenology. However, ''Freud and Philosophy'' became controversial. While the work was well received in France, it was also criticized there because phenomenology had become unfashionable by the time it was published. The work angered the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], who accused Ric\u0153ur of borrowing his ideas without attribution; although scholars have rejected the accusation, Lacan's followers attacked Ric\u0153ur. ''Freud and Philosophy'' received positive reviews upon the publication of its English translation in 1970. The book was described as one of the most important discussions of psychoanalysis and Ric\u0153ur was praised for his discussion of symbols. He was also credited with convincingly criticizing Freud's views on both symbols and religion generally. However, some critics have argued that Ric\u0153ur's views imply the impossibility of scientifically evaluating psychoanalysis.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Ric\u0153ur argues that Freud's work should be interpreted in terms of hermeneutics.]]\n\n===Preface===\nRic\u0153ur explains that his subject is Sigmund Freud, the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], rather than psychoanalysis itself, and that he therefore avoids discussing psychoanalytic literature subsequent to Freud and dissident figures such as the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]]. He stresses that ''Freud and Philosophy'' is a work of philosophy and not a work of psychology, and compares his enterprise to those of philosophers such as Roland Dalbiez in ''Psychoanalytical Method and the Doctrine of Freud'' (1936) and Herbert Marcuse in ''Eros and Civilization'' (1955), as well as to those of the sociologist Philip Rieff in ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (1959) and the psychoanalyst [[John Fl\u00fcgel]] in ''Man, Morals and Society'' (1945). Like Marcuse, Rieff, and Fl\u00fcgel, he considers psychoanalysis an \"interpretation of culture\", but unlike them his principal concern is the \"structure of Freudian discourse\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=xi\u2013xii}}\n\nHe identifies his main purposes as explaining the nature and purpose of interpretation in psychoanalysis, showing to what understanding of human nature psychoanalytic interpretation leads, and exploring whether or how Freud's interpretation of culture is compatible with other interpretations. He notes that by discussing these questions he further explores unresolved issues related to [[symbol]]s raised in his earlier work ''The Symbolism of Evil''. He explains the structure of ''Freud and Philosophy'', which includes Book I, the \"Problematic\", Book II, the \"Analytic\", and Book III, the \"Dialectic\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=xii\u2013xiii}}\n\n===Book I: Problematic: The Placing of Freud===\nRic\u0153ur relates his discussion of Freud to the emphasis on the importance of [[language]] shared by philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], schools of philosophy, such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], a movement founded by [[Edmund Husserl]], and English [[linguistic philosophy]], as well as disciplines such as [[New Testament]] [[exegesis]], [[comparative religion]], [[anthropology]], and psychoanalysis. He argues that there is a need for a \"comprehensive philosophy of language\" to explain its diverse purposes, and that psychoanalysts should participate in discussion of language.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=3\u20134}}\n\n[[Image:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|upright|Edmund Husserl, the founder of the philosophical movement of phenomenology, which Ric\u0153ur compares to psychoanalysis.]]\nHe maintains that one of Freud's objectives was \"a reinterpretation of all psychical productions pertaining to culture, from dreams, through art and morality, to religion\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=4}} Discussing Freud's theory of dreams, he writes that Freud used dreams as a model for all disguised expressions of human desire. He argues that psychoanalysis is concerned not with desires themselves but rather the language in which they are conveyed,{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=4\u20135}} that it involves a \"semantics of desire\",{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=6}} and that psychoanalytic concepts such as [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] and [[cathexis]] express dynamics or \"energetics\" that are \"articulated only in a semantics\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=6}} He writes that Freud's examinations of dreams and related phenomena such as humor, mythology, and religion, shows that they are meaningful and concern the way in which desires \"achieve speech\". He concludes that psychoanalysis offers a new approach to speech.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=6}} In Ric\u0153ur's view, Freud's work suggests that language resembles dreams, in the sense that it \"means something other than what it says\" and expresses \"double meaning\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=7}} According to Ric\u0153ur, dreams and phenomena comparable to them, including both [[insanity]] and human culture in general, involve \"significations where another meaning is both given and hidden in an immediate meaning\",{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=7}} which he equates with the symbol.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=7}}\n\nComparing the way in which psychoanalysis addresses \"double meaning\" to that of the [[phenomenology of religion]], he identifies both similarities and differences between the two approaches. In his view, the primary difference is that phenomena that psychoanalysis views as distorted reflections of basic desires are regarded by the phenomenology of religion as \"the revelation of the sacred\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=6\u20137}} The relative merits of these views are one of his major concerns.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=7\u20138}} He argues that psychoanalysis is concerned with \"the hermeneutic field\", which concerns double meanings and the confrontation between different forms of interpretation.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=8}} He defines \"hermeneutics\" as \"the theory of the rules that preside over an exegesis\u2014that is, over the interpretation of a particular text, or of a group of signs that may be viewed as a text\",{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=8}} adding that exegesis can be understood to include the interpretation of things analogous to texts. Seeking an appropriate definition of symbolism, he criticizes the philosopher [[Ernst Cassirer]]'s ideas about the \"symbolic function\", as put forward in ''The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'' (1923\u20131929), and makes use of the understanding of poetic imagination advanced in the philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]]'s ''[[The Poetics of Space]]'' (1958). He proposes that \"the problem of symbolism\" is to a large extent coextensive with that of language.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=8\u201311, 15\u201316}}\n\nIn Ric\u0153ur's view, Freud's work can be compared to that of the philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He refers to the trio as masters of the \"[[Hermeneutics of suspicion|school of suspicion]]\", arguing that despite their differences, the apparent incompatibility of their ideas, and despite caricatures or misunderstandings of their conclusions, they all view consciousness primarily as [[false consciousness]], seeking to explain its process and provide a means of deciphering it, with the objective of extending consciousness.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=17, 32\u201335}} He views all of them as being fundamentally opposed to the \"phenomenology of the sacred\" and to \"hermeneutics understood as the recollection of meaning and as the reminiscence of being\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=35}}\n[[File:Karl Marx_001.jpg|thumb|upright|Karl Marx, the founder of Marxism. Ric\u0153ur writes that Marx and Freud are masters of the \"school of suspicion\".]]\n\n===Book II: Analytic: Reading of Freud===\nRic\u0153ur explains that the second section of the book is called an \"Analytic\" because in it he is concerned with describing psychoanalysis based solely on Freud's presentation of it and discusses it in relation to other perspectives primarily to show how it differs from or is opposed to them.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=59\u201361}} He argues that psychoanalysis can be understood as both an \"energetics\", in that it entails \"an explanation of psychical phenomena through conflicts of forces\", and a \"hermeneutics\", in that it entails an \"exegesis of apparent meaning through a latent meaning\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=62}} He discusses Freud's theories of the [[death drive]], the [[defence mechanisms]], [[homosexuality]], the [[id, ego and super-ego]], [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], the [[libido]], [[metapsychology]], [[narcissism]], the [[Oedipus complex]], the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], the [[preconscious]], the [[psychic apparatus]], [[psychosexual development]], the [[reality principle]], [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]], the [[transference]], the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], as well as [[dreamwork]], [[Freud's seduction theory]], and the method of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]].{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=61\u201363, 67\u201379, 84\u201386, 95\u201396, 104\u2013107, 115, 119, 121\u2013122, 128\u2013132, 172, 179, 195, 216, 219}}\n\nHe suggests that in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899), Freud did not succeed in reconciling the \"language of meaning\" and the \"quasi-physical language\" implied by different parts of his theory. He notes that for Freud, dreams provide the \"ultimate proof\" of the existence of the unconscious, since in Freud's view the dreamwork's activity of distortion makes it necessary to attribute to the unconscious both a distinct place in the structure of the mind and its own set of laws.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=115, 119}} He considers the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious \"totally unphenomenological\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=119}} He also sees a fundamental contrast between Husserl's [[epoch\u00e9]], which involves a \"reduction ''to'' consciousness\", and the procedures of psychoanalysis, which involve a \"reduction ''of'' consciousness\". He argues that the contrast is the result of Freud's emphasis on [[instinct]], which displaces an emphasis on the role of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and the [[Object (philosophy)|object]] in consciousness, and observes that Freud realized that by using the concept of instinct to \"relate empirical facts\", he had moved from description to systematization, and that this involved the use of conventions, hypotheses, and postulates. He elaborates that Freud's postulates included those concerned with the operation of the psychic apparatus,{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=121\u2013123}} which in Freud's view was regulated by qualities of \"pleasure-unpleasure\", which in turn depended on \"the amounts of stimulus ... affecting mental life\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=123}}\n[[File:Nietzsche187a.jpg|thumb|upright|Friedrich Nietzsche. Ric\u0153ur argues that Nietzsche, like Freud and Marx, is a master of the \"school of suspicion\".]]\n\nObserving that, for Freud, the object of instincts must be understood in terms of their aim and not the reverse, he adds that the object may be either something external to a person or part of his or her own body. He credits Freud with making these discoveries in ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' (1905). He provides examples of how Freud attempted to explain the process by which instincts change their objects in his theories of narcissism and identification,{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=123\u2013125, 127\u2013128}} observing that, for Freud, explaining narcissism meant showing that \"not only is the object a function of the aim of an instinct, but the ego itself is an aim of instinct\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=127}} He writes that, in Freud's view, narcissism has to be understood through its secondary expressions, such as the perversion \"in which one's own body is treated as an object of love\",{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=127}} and that the theory of narcissism helped Freud to show that displacement of narcissism is the basis of \"the formation of ideals\" and thus has implications for the theory of identification. He notes that, for Freud, identification is based in the [[oral stage]] of development and modeled after the act of devouring. He argues that it was important for Freud that he decide whether it involves a desire to possess something or a desire to be like something, since only the former could be traced to oral origins.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=127\u2013128, 131\u2013132}}\n\nFollowing earlier commentary, Ric\u0153ur maintains that Freud uses different sets of terms, including an \"observational\" set concerned with observable phenomena and a \"theoretical\" set concerned with phenomena that cannot be observed, including various hypothesized forces. He maintains that the conflict between hermeneutics and an incompatible discourse of \"economics\", involving quantities of energy, persisted in Freud's work after ''The Interpretation of Dreams'',{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=138, 140, 142\u2013143}} and concludes that in it, \"the language of force can never be overcome by the language of meaning\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=149}} According to Ric\u0153ur, psychoanalytic claims about religion are shaped by both the \"topographic-economic model\" of Freudian metapsychology and by the example of dreams.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=153\u2013154}} He argues that aspects of Freud's views on religion, such as his \"radical questioning\" of it, merit the consideration of both religious believers and non-believers, despite potential misunderstandings by both groups. He also proposes that psychoanalysis can co-exist with \"purified\" religious faith. However, he questions Freud's analogy between religion and neurosis, as well as the accuracy of some of his claims about the history of religion.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=230, 232, 245}} Freud's hypothesis of the [[death instinct]], put forward in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' (1920), is criticized by Ric\u0153ur, who describes it as speculative and as resting on a limited factual basis. He draws connections between Freud's ideas about the death instinct and his views about the structure of the mind as presented in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923).{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=281\u2013309}}\n\n===Book III: Dialectic: A Philosophical Interpretation of Freud===\nRic\u0153ur explains that the third section of the book is concerned with criticism of Freud's ideas. He summarizes his approach as involving first examining the validity of psychoanalysis from the standpoint of [[epistemology]], then exploring its concepts through elaborating an \"archaeology of the subject\". He adds that he then integrates this \"archaeology\" with a \"[[teleology]]\" in a way that suggests the possibility of interrelating these \"opposed hermeneutics\", and that it is because of this integration that the third section is called a \"Dialectic\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=341\u2013342}}\n[[File:Hegel portrait by Schlesinger 1831.jpg|thumb|upright|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Ric\u0153ur compares the ideas of Hegel and Freud.]]\n\nHe compares psychoanalysis to both scientific psychology and phenomenology, arguing that it cannot be made part of a \"general psychology\". He writes that most philosophers who have discussed psychoanalysis have concluded that it fails to satisfy the basic requirements of a scientific theory. He credits [[Ernest Nagel]] with presenting the strongest such argument, summarizing it as follows. It is questionable whether psychoanalysis is subject to empirical verification, since some its concepts are so vague and metaphorical, and have such an unclear relevance to behavior, that it appears impossible to either deduce specific conclusions from them or explain how psychoanalysis itself [[Falsifiability|could be refuted]]. Furthermore, there is no way of showing that psychoanalytic interpretations are valid because psychoanalytic data cannot be separated from the relationship of a given analyst to his or her patients and the suspicion that interpretations are forced upon the data by analysts is unavoidable given the lack of comparative procedures and statistical investigation. Between them, these problems make it impossible for independent inquirers to obtain the same data under carefully standardized circumstances or for psychoanalysts to establish objective procedures to decide which conflicting interpretations might be correct. Claims made by psychoanalysts about the effectiveness of treatment are unavailing, since the percentages of improvement cannot be strictly established or defined by appropriate studies, making it impossible to compare the effectiveness of psychoanalysis to other methods of treatment.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=345\u2013347}}\n\nIn Ric\u0153ur's view, such arguments are convincing so long as psychoanalysis is considered an observational science. He argues that psychoanalysts should, but have not, respond by presenting psychoanalysis as an \"interpretation\" that resembles history rather than psychology. He argues that while some psychoanalysts have tried to reformulate psychoanalysis so that it meets scientific criteria acceptable to psychologists, aspects of Freudian theory make this difficult. He refers to the attempt to assimilate psychoanalysis to observational psychology as the \"operational\" reformulation of psychoanalysis. He writes that such efforts at [[operationalization]] have not satisfied psychologists. He nevertheless argues that they are legitimate, writing that it is desirable for psychoanalysis to be evaluated by psychology and that attempts should be made to validate or invalidate its results.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=345, 347, 352, 358}} However, he emphasizes that such reformulation of psychoanalysis is \"a second operation with respect to the experience on the basis of which the Freudian concepts have arisen\" and as such can only deal with results that are \"detached from the analytic experience\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=358}}\n\nEmphasizing the importance of the difference between the concepts of psychoanalysis and those of behavioral psychology, Ric\u0153ur endorses the philosopher [[Stephen Toulmin]]'s argument that an explanation of human behavior in terms of motives is different in kind from an explanation of human behavior in terms of causes, and that psychoanalysis deals with motives rather than causes. He maintains that because psychoanalysis is concerned with motive concepts, there is a clear distinction between it and observational science. Criticizing the idea that psychoanalysis resembles an experimental science, he emphasizes, following the work of Jacques Lacan,{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=359\u2013360, 363, 366\u2013367}} that an analysis is based on verbal interactions between a psychoanalyst and a patient and that it reveals \"another language, dissociated from common language, and which presents itself to be deciphered through its meaningful effects\" such as symptoms and dreams.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=367}} He maintains that [[psychoanalytic theory]] is thus concerned with \"analytic experience, insofar as the latter operates in the field of speech\". He critiques Freud's theories concerning sublimation, arguing that they suffer from multiple problems and that sublimation is an \"empty concept\", as well as his views on language. He also discusses the relationship between Freud's ideas and those of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], comparing the role that desire plays in both men's work.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=375, 387, 483\u2013494, 544}}\n\n==Background and publication history==\nAccording to Ric\u0153ur, ''Freud and Philosophy'' originated in the [[Dwight H. Terry Lectureship|Terry Lectures]] given at [[Yale University]] in 1961, and was also developed in lectures given at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1835\u20131968)|University of Louvain]] in 1962.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=xi}} The book was first published in French in May 1965 by [[\u00c9ditions du Seuil]], as part of the series ''L'Ordre philosophique'' (The Philosophic Order).{{sfn|Roudinesco|1990|page=393}}{{sfn|Roudinesco|1997|page=324}} In 1970, an English translation by Denis Savage was published in hardcover by [[Yale University Press]].

Brown's ''Life Against Death'' (1959). The philosopher Jeffrey Abramson, who praised Ric\u0153ur's discussions of narcissism and sublimation, maintained that these works jointly placed Freud at the center of moral and philosophical inquiry.{{sfn|Abramson|1986|pages=ix, 26, 83}} ''Freud and Philosophy'' has also been praised by the philosophers [[Don Ihde]], who nevertheless argued that its approach to interpretation is limited by its focus on the ideas of symbol and double meaning,{{sfn|Ihde|1980|pages=xvi, 132}} [[Richard Kearney]],{{sfn|Kearney|1989|page=7}} and [[Douglas Kellner]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kearney|1y=2009|1pp=167\u2013183|2a1=Kellner|2y=1984|2pp=193, 195, 434}} Kearney credited Ric\u0153ur with demonstrating that the symbolic imagination is linguistic;{{sfn|Kearney|1989|page=7}} he has also suggested that Ric\u0153ur was engaged in a form of [[eschatology]].{{sfn|Kearney|2009|pages=167\u2013183}} Kellner credited Ric\u0153ur with demonstrating the importance of psychoanalysis for \"increasing understanding of human nature and contributing to the process of self-formation\". He believed Ric\u0153ur made better use of some Freudian ideas than did Marcuse.{{sfn|Kellner|1984|pages=193, 195, 434}}\n\n''Freud and Philosophy'' has been praised by the psychoanalysts R. D. Chessick,{{sfn|Chessick|1988|pages=299\u2013318}} [[Joel Kovel]],{{sfn|Kovel|1991|pages=5, 240}} and Joel Whitebook.{{sfn|Whitebook|2017|page=121}} Chessick called the book a \"classic\" and \"one of the best philosophical works on Freud\", crediting Ric\u0153ur with providing a \"thorough and scholarly\" discussion of Freud, and with presenting \"brilliant ideas and conceptions\". He praised Ric\u0153ur's treatment of Freud's view of religion. He compared the structure of ''Freud and Philosophy'' to that of the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781), and found its \"methodology and prose\" reminiscent of Hegel. However, he described the work as poorly written and sometimes unintelligible. He also faulted Ric\u0153ur for over-emphasizing symbols and for his treatment of the transference and the relationship of psychoanalysis to science. He suggested that Ric\u0153ur borrowed from Lacan, finding this apparent in Ric\u0153ur's understanding of the \"semantics of desire\".{{sfn|Chessick|1988|pages=299\u2013318}} Kovel described ''Freud and Philosophy'' as an important demonstration that Freud was a post-Hegelian thinker.{{sfn|Kovel|1991|pages=5, 240}} Whitebook argued that ''Freud and Philosophy'' was \"unsurpassed\" and disproved the view that clinical experience is necessary for understanding psychoanalytic theory.{{sfn|Whitebook|2017|page=121}}\n\nThe psychologists [[Paul Vitz]] and Malcolm Macmillan have both praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of Freud's theories about the development of the ego.{{sfn|Vitz|1988|pages=32, 230}}{{sfn|Macmillan|1997|page=446, 486\u2013487, 496}} Macmillan credited Ric\u0153ur with recognizing that Freud saw a close connection between the mental structures he outlined in ''The Ego and the Id'' and the instinctual theory he put forward in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''. He endorsed Ric\u0153ur's criticism of the concept of sublimation and his questioning of the idea that identification has an oral origin.{{sfn|Macmillan|1997|page=446, 486\u2013487, 496}} Ric\u0153ur's hermeneutic approach to psychoanalysis has been discussed by the historians [[Peter Gay]] and Roger Smith.{{sfn|Gay|1995|page=745}}{{sfn|Smith|1997|page=856}} Gay described ''Freud and Philosophy'' as a \"highly disciplined study\", but noted his disagreement with the work.{{sfn|Gay|1995|page=745}} Smith credited Ric\u0153ur with demonstrating the merits of a hermeneutic approach to Freud.{{sfn|Smith|1997|page=856}} The pastoral counselor Kirk A. Bingaman praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of hermeneutics, crediting him with demonstrating that \"a Freudian hermeneutic\" can both challenge and \"purify and strengthen\" religious faith.{{sfn|Bingaman|1999|pages=91\u2013105}}\n\nHowever, ''Freud and Philosophy'' has received criticism from psychologists such as [[Hans Eysenck]], [[Glenn Wilson (psychologist)|Glenn Wilson]], and [[Paul Kline]], who have attributed to Ric\u0153ur the view that psychoanalysis either cannot or should not be evaluated in terms of experimental evidence.{{sfn|Eysenck|Wilson|1976|pages=393\u2013395}}{{sfn|Kline|1995|page=4}} Eysenck and Wilson described ''Freud and Philosophy'' as a good example of a defense of psychoanalysis against the claim that it should be so evaluated. They argued that Ric\u0153ur espoused a form of \"extreme subjectivism\" which implies that psychoanalytic theories cannot be tested empirically or shown to be mistaken. They suggested that Freud would have rejected Ric\u0153ur's conclusions and that few psychologists or psychoanalysts would accept them. They also argued that if Ric\u0153ur's conclusions were to be accepted, this would further undermine psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Eysenck|Wilson|1976|pages=393\u2013395}} Kline wrote that Ric\u0153ur might be correct that psychoanalysis cannot be dealt with through experiments based on quantifiable evidence, but argued that if he is, this shows that psychoanalytic theory is not scientific.{{sfn|Kline|1995|page=4}} The sociologist [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]] considered Ric\u0153ur's views about the role of language and meaning in psychoanalysis similar to those of Lacan. While Thompson praised ''Freud and Philosophy'', he believed that Ric\u0153ur failed to resolve the \"question of the scientific status of psychoanalysis\" in the work. He and Ric\u0153ur both noted that Ric\u0153ur took a different approach to the issue in his essay \"The question of proof in Freud's psychoanalytic writings\", which was published in ''[[Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences]]'' (1981).{{sfn|Thompson|1981|pages=3, 7, 24}}{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1981|page=38}}\n\nThe philosopher [[Richard J. Bernstein]] credited Ric\u0153ur with showing that there was always a tension in Freud's thinking between an emphasis on \"energetics\" and an emphasis on \"hermeneutics\", and with using his discussion of Hegel to explain aspects of Freud's work. However, he noted that Ric\u0153ur presented only one possible philosophical interpretation of Freud, and suggested that the section of ''Freud and Philosophy'' in which he did so was the weakest part of the book. He argued that Ric\u0153ur's interpretation of Freud suffered from \"tensions and unresolved issues\". He also remained unconvinced by Ric\u0153ur's critique of Freud's views on religion.{{sfn|Bernstein|2013|pages=130\u2013139}} Ric\u0153ur has also been criticized by the philosophers [[Ronald de Sousa]], Geoff Waite, and [[Todd Dufresne]].{{sfnm|1a1=De Sousa|1y=1995|1pp=85, 340|2a1=Waite|2y=1996|2p=106|3a1=Dufresne|3y=2000|3pp=122\u2013123, 126|4a1=Dufresne|4y=2011|4p=14}} De Sousa maintained that Ric\u0153ur was one of several commentators on Freud to have incorrectly argued that Freud, by basing the method of psychoanalysis on an extension of the principle of determinism from the physical to the mental realm, confused determinism and meaningfulness.{{sfn|De Sousa|1995|pages=85, 340}} Waite described Ric\u0153ur's claim that Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche form a \"school of suspicion\" as \"famous\" but misleading.{{sfn|Waite|1996|page=106}} Dufresne considered Ric\u0153ur's interpretation of Freud evenhanded and in some ways superior to Lacan's. He credited Ric\u0153ur with discussing important points that are rarely addressed, and complimented his interpretation of the concept of the death drive. However, he concluded that Ric\u0153ur's attempt to \"oppose and then synthesize\" Freud and Hegel was already dated when ''Freud and Philosophy'' was published.{{sfn|Dufresne|2000|pages=122\u2013123, 126}} He noted that thinkers such Marcuse, Lacan, [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Judith Butler]] have produced interpretations of ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' irreconcilable with Ric\u0153ur's.{{sfn|Dufresne|2011|page=14}}\n\n===Reception in France===\nAccording to the historian and psychoanalyst [[\u00c9lisabeth Roudinesco]], Ric\u0153ur first presented the interpretation of Freud later expounded in ''Freud and Philosophy'' at a colloquium held in France in 1960. Roudinesco maintains that ''Freud and Philosophy'' combines hermeneutics with a philosophy inspired by \"post-Hegelian phenomenology\", draws on Christian traditions and language, and conflicted with the structuralism of the early 1960s.{{sfn|Roudinesco|1990|pages=308, 391\u2013392}} According to Roudinesco, ''Freud and Philosophy'' was well received in France because it was the first book of its kind, but also criticized because phenomenology had become unfashionable by the time it was published in May 1965.{{sfn|Roudinesco|1990|page=394}}\n\n''Freud and Philosophy'' angered Lacan, who had expected the book to praise him.{{sfnm|1a1=Roudinesco|1y=1990|1p=395|2a1=Reagan|2y=1998|2p=28|3a1=Dufresne|3y=2000|3p=126}} It has been suggested that Lacan was angered by ''Freud and Philosophy'' because he considered himself alone to be the \"authentic French interpreter of Freud\".{{sfn|Reagan|1998|page=28}} Lacan spread the rumor, which convinced Lacan's followers, that Ric\u0153ur had borrowed his ideas without attribution.{{sfn|Roudinesco|1990|pages=394\u2013396}} Some psychoanalysts influenced by Lacan argued that since Ric\u0153ur was not a psychoanalyst and had never been psychoanalyzed he was incompetent to write about Freud.{{sfn|Reagan|1998|page=28}} In ''Critique'', the psychoanalyst Jean-Paul Valabrega accused Ric\u0153ur of having drawn on Lacan's ideas despite claiming to be original. At the request of the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], ''Critique'' published a reply by Ric\u0153ur, in which he denied the accusation and explained that he had completed the outline of his interpretation of Freud before having read Lacan. Roudinesco dismisses the charge that Ric\u0153ur had borrowed Lacan's ideas, arguing that he could not have done so given his failure to understand them.{{sfn|Roudinesco|1990|pages=394\u2013396}}\n\nRoudinesco states that ''Freud and Philosophy'' received a negative review in ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' from Michel Tort, who argued that the book was obscurantist and reactionary, that Ric\u0153ur's Christian and phenomenological approach to understanding Freud's texts was unhelpful and obsolete, and that Lacan's approach to psychoanalysis was superior to that of Ric\u0153ur.{{sfn|Roudinesco|1990|pages=396\u2013397}} Vinicio Busacchi wrote that Tort's discussion of ''Freud and Philosophy'' was \"fallacious and calumnious\" and that the accusation of plagiarism against Ric\u0153ur was false.{{sfn|Busacchi|2016|pages=56\u201371}}\n\nOthers who responded to the book in France include the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]]'s students, whose view of the work was negative,{{sfn|Boer|2005|pages=69\u201371}} as well as [[Deleuze and Guattari]];{{sfn|Genosko|2002|page=121}}{{sfn|Michel|2015|pages=75, 96}} Ric\u0153ur's arguments about the death instinct influenced their joint work ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972).{{sfn|Genosko|2002|page=121}} However, they were critical of Ric\u0153ur's interpretation of Freud's theory of culture.{{sfn|Michel|2015|pages=75, 96}} After Ric\u0153ur's death in 2005, the philosopher [[Jonathan R\u00e9e]] wrote that ''Freud and Philosophy'' was a \"powerful\" book that had been \"scandalously neglected in France\".{{sfn|R\u00e9e|2005}}\n\n===Reviews in scientific and academic journals===\n''Freud and Philosophy'' received positive reviews in academic journals written in English. These reviews included those by the psychiatrist Peter H. Knapp in ''[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]'',{{sfn|Knapp|1971|pages=978\u2013979}} the psychoanalyst Gerald J.

Hems in ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]''.{{sfn|Hems|1971|page=135}}\n\nKnapp described the book as \"thoughtful, searching, and comprehensive\". He wrote that Ric\u0153ur had broad knowledge of both philosophy and psychoanalysis. He credited him with carefully distinguishing between different aspects of Freud's work and convincingly criticizing Freud's hypotheses about language and views about religion. He also believed that he revealed Freud's \"lack of a broad view of symbolic functioning\", exposed confusions in Freud's thought, such as that between \"force\" as a metaphorical term and \"force\" as a reference to observable phenomena, and showed that psychoanalysis resembles historical science and phenomenology rather than science as understood by positivism. He praised his discussion of Toulmin. However, he suggested that integrating Freud's views about meaning with Freud's ideas about \"drive energy\" would \"require a more comprehensive psychosomatic theory of emotion\" than that provided by Ric\u0153ur, and that ''Freud and Philosophy'' was sometimes confused and presented debatable conclusions. He compared the book to Brown's ''Life Against Death''.{{sfn|Knapp|1971|pages=978\u2013979}} Gargiulo described the book as \"a provocative philosophical enterprise and a masterful reading of Freud\" and \"a text of extraordinary complexity and sensitivity\". He compared Ric\u0153ur's work to that of Rieff, and credited him with showing that \"desire has a semantics\" and that psychoanalysis \"cannot be verified as in physical and experimental sciences\". He praised his discussions of sublimation and symbols. However, he criticized Ric\u0153ur's discussion of the reality principle.{{sfn|Gargiulo|1971|pages=295\u2013301}}\n\nVivas described the book as the most thorough study of Freudian theory that he was aware of. He considered it similar, but also superior to, ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist''. He praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of Freud's views on religion, crediting him with convincingly criticizing and correcting them. However, while finding Ric\u0153ur's views on religion preferable to Freud's, he nevertheless disagreed with them. He also expressed uncertainty about whether Ric\u0153ur had resolved the issue of the scientific status of psychoanalysis, and questioned the value of Ric\u0153ur's discussion of the reasons for the difficulty of resolving whether the processes postulated by psychoanalysis actually exist.{{sfn|Vivas|1971|pages=310\u2013314}} Slaughter suggested that the book might be the best commentary on Freud ever written, maintaining that it not only assisted in the understanding of Freud but had implications for the practice of philosophy. However, he criticized Ric\u0153ur's discussion of Freud's views on religion, believing that Ric\u0153ur interrupted his discussion of Freud by presenting his personal beliefs.{{sfn|Slaughter|1972|pages=56\u201358}}\n\nGrolnick understood the work as \"a stage in the development of a comprehensive religious philosophy\". He credited Ric\u0153ur with placing psychoanalysis in a larger historical and intellectual context and relating it to contemporary cultural trends, showing broad knowledge of philosophy, literature, and religion, and providing a useful discussion of the development of Freud's work. He praised Ric\u0153ur's exploration of topics such as narcissism, identification, sublimation, and the reality principle, and believed that he showed the flaws of some of Freud's views on art, culture, and religion. He complimented Ric\u0153ur for his comparison of psychoanalysis and phenomenology. However, he wrote that psychoanalysts might disagree with Ric\u0153ur's assessment of the scientific status of psychoanalysis, and that some of Ric\u0153ur's criticisms of Freud were unoriginal, having been made within psychoanalysis itself.{{sfn|Grolnick|1972|pages=436\u2013443}} Reider described the work as \"one of the most important books on the theory of psychoanalysis in the last two decades\". He praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of Freud, crediting him with noting respects in which Freud's views were illogical, inconsistent, or incomplete, especially where religion was concerned. He considered Ric\u0153ur's critique of Freud superior to anything written by psychoanalysts. He also praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of \"symbols and symbolization\" and his criticism of Nagel. However, he wrote that Ric\u0153ur's \"preoccupation with religion, with the sacred, and his conclusion that psychoanalyis is teleological contain weighty evidence of his acceptance of idealism\".{{sfn|Reider|1972|pages=142\u2013144}}\n\nIhde maintained that the book was primarily about language and hermeneutics and that Ric\u0153ur's discussion of Freud was often \"tedious\". He credited Ric\u0153ur with using the Freudian ideas to correct phenomenology. He noted that the book was \"Ric\u0153ur's most controversial work\", and that it was criticized by adherents of phenomenology, who argued that Ric\u0153ur ignored the contributions of \"phenomenological-existentialist psychologists\". He rejected such criticisms. He also argued that despite the charge that Ric\u0153ur had borrowed ideas from Lacan, ''Freud and Philosophy'' reflected themes, such as the importance of symbols, that Ric\u0153ur had explored in earlier works such as ''The Symbolism of Evil''.{{sfn|Ihde|1972|pages=138\u2013139}}\n\nSlater considered the book impressive, calling it the first detailed study \"by a professional philosopher of the development of Freud's thought and of psychoanalytical theory in all the stages of its growth\". He praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of the development of Freud's ideas. However, he found it unclear whether Ric\u0153ur \"shows successfully on what grounds psychoanalysis could subjected to any criticism whatsoever\". He suggested that Ric\u0153ur's view of the interactions between psychoanalysts and their patients misleadingly suggested that there is no way for third parties to determine the truth or untruth of the claims made by the analysts about their patients. He believed that this undermined their credibility.{{sfn|Slater|1972|pages=455\u2013457}}\n\nStack described the book as \"illuminating and profound\". He credited Ric\u0153ur with providing \"the most complete philosophical interpretation\" of psychoanalysis to date, demonstrating \"the incompleteness of Freud's conception of symbols\", carefully discussing Freud's view of instinct, convincingly criticizing Freud's theorizing about the death instinct, and usefully comparing \"Hegel's phenomenology of desire and Freudian theory\". He praised Ric\u0153ur's comparison of psychoanalysis and phenomenology, suggesting that he showed that they are ultimately incompatible despite the similarities between them. While he believed that Ric\u0153ur's insights undermined Freud's hostility to religion, he questioned Ric\u0153ur's attempt to find common ground between Freud and the phenomenology of religion. He was also unconvinced by Ric\u0153ur's attempt to demonstrate \"an implicit teleology in psychoanalysis\".{{sfn|Stack|1973|pages=318\u2013322}}\n\nIn ''Religious Studies Review'', Lowe credited Ric\u0153ur with providing an interesting perspective on psychoanalysis. He compared Ric\u0153ur's views to those of Browning. He praised his comparison of psychoanalysis and phenomenology, crediting him with showing why it is wrong to absorb psychoanalysis into phenomenology or identify the two. He also praised his discussion of Freud's ideas in relation to those of Hegel. He wrote that he had influenced discussions of the relevance of Freud to theology, for example in his description of a teleological aspect to Freudian thought. However, he suggested that ''Freud and Philosophy'' contained unusual language.{{sfn|Lowe|1978|pages=246\u2013254}} Hems wrote that the book could be seen as either \"a work of formidable thoroughness\" or one of \"irksome prolixity\", depending on one's point of view. He questioned whether Ric\u0153ur's attempt to reinterpret Freud was successful.{{sfn|Hems|1971|page=135}}\n\n===Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum's criticism===\nThe philosopher [[Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum]] has discussed ''Freud and Philosophy'' in works such as ''[[The Foundations of Psychoanalysis]]'' (1984) and ''[[Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis]]'' (1993).{{sfn|Gr\u00fcnbaum|1985|pages=43\u201369, 73}}{{sfn|Gr\u00fcnbaum|1993|pages=114\u2013116}} In ''The Foundations of Psychoanalysis'', he criticized Ric\u0153ur's hermeneutic interpretation of Freud, arguing that Ric\u0153ur incorrectly limited the relevance of psychoanalytic theory to verbal statements made during analytic therapy. He accused Ric\u0153ur of wanting to protect his hermeneutic understanding of psychoanalysis from scientific examination and criticism, and maintained that Ric\u0153ur's arguments rested on an untenable dichotomy between theory and observation and that he took a reductive form of [[behaviorism]] as his model of scientific psychology. He argued that Ric\u0153ur's view that psychoanalysis provides a \"semantics of desire\" mistakenly equates symptoms with linguistic representations of their causes, and accused Ric\u0153ur of endorsing Lacan's \"obfuscating\" view that a symptom resembles \"a language whose speech must be realized\". However, Gr\u00fcnbaum gave Ric\u0153ur credit for later, in ''Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences'', reassessing his views by abandoning the dichotomy between reasons and causes.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcnbaum|1985|pages=43\u201369, 73}}\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum's criticisms of Ric\u0153ur have been endorsed, in whole or in part, by the psychologist [[Robert R. Holt]],{{sfn|Holt|1989|pages=314\u2013316}} the psychoanalyst [[Jonathan Lear]],{{sfn|Lear|1992|page=49}} the historian Paul Robinson,{{sfn|Robinson|1993|pages=73, 195, 265}} and the critic [[Frederick Crews]].{{sfn|Crews|1999|page=xxix}} Holt dismissed ''Freud and Philosophy'', arguing that it was only superficially impressive, that parts of it were unreadable, and that Ric\u0153ur used vague or inappropriately metaphorical language. He also maintained that Ric\u0153ur's view that psychoanalysis is not a science depended on unoriginal arguments. Though he noted that Ric\u0153ur's views were supported by some psychoanalysts, he argued that if Ric\u0153ur's view that psychoanalysis does not have to make predictions and is not subject to \"substantial constraints\" were correct, it would mean the end of psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Holt|1989|pages=314\u2013316}} Lear criticized ''Freud and Philosophy'', blaming it, along with ''Knowledge and Human Interests'', for convincing some psychoanalysts that reasons cannot be causes.{{sfn|Lear|1992|page=49}} Robinson described ''Freud and Philosophy'' as a classic portrayal of Freud as a hermeneutician and a philosopher similar to Nietzsche. He compared Ric\u0153ur's views to those of Derrida. Although he believed that there was some truth to them, he argued that Ric\u0153ur's arguments obscured Freud's identification with the scientific tradition. He credited Gr\u00fcnbaum with showing that Ric\u0153ur was misguided in this respect.{{sfn|Robinson|1993|pages=73, 195, 265}} Crews criticized Ric\u0153ur for helping to inspire unscientific defenses of Freud and psychoanalysis and for misunderstanding Freud.{{sfn|Crews|1999|page=xxix}} The philosopher Philippe Lacour suggested that the debate between Gr\u00fcnbaum and Ric\u0153ur suffered from the fact that, while Gr\u00fcnbaum read and responded to Ric\u0153ur's writings, it was unclear whether Ric\u0153ur paid any attention to Gr\u00fcnbaum.{{sfn|Lacour|2016|pages=120\u2013147}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Freud and His Critics]]''\n* ''[[Love and Its Place in Nature]]''\n* ''[[Philosophical Essays on Freud]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n;Books\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Abramson |first1=Jeffrey B. |title=Liberation and Its Limits: The Moral and Political Thought of Freud |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=Boston |year=1986 |isbn=0-8070-2913-0 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/liberationitslim0000abra }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Crews |first1=Frederick |title=Unauthorized Freud: Doubters Confront a Legend |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-14-028017-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=De Sousa |first1=Ronald |title=The Rationality of Emotion |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |isbn=0-262-54057-6 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Dufresne|first1=Todd |title=Tales From the Freudian Crypt: The Death Drive in Text and Context |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |location=Stanford, California |year=2000 |isbn=0-8047-3885-8 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Dufresne|first1=Todd |chapter=Introduction |editor-last1=Dufresne|editor-first1=Todd |title=Beyond the Pleasure Principle |publisher=[[Broadview Press|Broadview Editions]] |location=Toronto |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-55111-994-6 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Eysenck|first1=Hans J. |last2=Wilson|first2=Glenn D. |chapter=Epilogue |editor-last1=Eysenck|editor-first1=Hans J. |editor-last2=Wilson|editor-first2=Glenn D. |title=The Experimental Study of Freudian Theories |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen & Co Ltd]] |location=London |year=1976 |isbn=0-416-70470-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Gay|first1=Peter |title=Freud: A Life for Our Time |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Papermac]] |location=Harmondsworth |year=1995 |isbn=0-333-48638-2 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Genosko|first1=Gary |title=F\u00e9lix Guattari: An Aberrant Introduction |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]] |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-8264-6034-8 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Grayling |first1=A.

Essai sur Sigmund Freud}}) is a 1965 book about [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], by the French philosopher [[Paul Ric\u0153ur]]. In ''Freud and Philosophy'', Ric\u0153ur interprets Freud's work in terms of [[hermeneutics]], the theory of the rules that govern the interpretation of a particular text, and discusses [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], a school of philosophy founded by [[Edmund Husserl]]. He addresses questions such as the nature of interpretation in psychoanalysis, the understanding of human nature to which it leads, and the relationship between Freud's interpretation of culture and other interpretations. The book was first published in France by [[\u00c9ditions du Seuil]], and in the United States by [[Yale University Press]].\n\nRic\u0153ur explores what he considers a tension in Freud's work between an emphasis on \"energetics\", which explains psychological phenomena in terms of quantities of energy, and an emphasis on hermeneutics. He compares Freud to the philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], describing the trio as a \"[[Hermeneutics of suspicion|school of suspicion]]\", and explores similarities and differences between psychoanalysis and phenomenology. He also compares Freud's ideas to those of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], criticizes [[Sigmund Freud's views on religion|Freud's views on religion]], discusses [[language]], and further develops ideas about [[symbol]]s explored in his earlier work ''The Symbolism of Evil'' (1960). In response to criticism of the scientific status of psychoanalysis by philosophers such as [[Ernest Nagel]], Ric\u0153ur argues that psychoanalysis should be understood not as an observational science, but as an \"interpretation\" that resembles [[history]] rather than [[psychology]]. He criticizes psychoanalysts for failing to adopt this as their response to arguments that psychoanalysis is unscientific.\n\nOne of Ric\u0153ur's most noted works, ''Freud and Philosophy'' has been compared to the philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' (1955), the classicist [[Norman O. Brown]]'s ''[[Life Against Death]]'' (1959), the sociologist [[Philip Rieff]]'s ''[[Freud: The Mind of the Moralist]]'' (1959), and the philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]'s ''[[Knowledge and Human Interests]]'' (1968). Commentators have praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of [[Freud's psychoanalytic theories|Freud's theories]], his exploration of usually neglected aspects of Freud's work, his comparison of Freud to Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche, and his discussion of phenomenology. However, ''Freud and Philosophy'' became controversial. While the work was well received in France, it was also criticized there because phenomenology had become unfashionable by the time it was published. The work angered the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], who accused Ric\u0153ur of borrowing his ideas without attribution; although scholars have rejected the accusation, Lacan's followers attacked Ric\u0153ur. ''Freud and Philosophy'' received positive reviews upon the publication of its English translation in 1970. The book was described as one of the most important discussions of psychoanalysis and Ric\u0153ur was praised for his discussion of symbols. He was also credited with convincingly criticizing Freud's views on both symbols and religion generally. However, some critics have argued that Ric\u0153ur's views imply the impossibility of scientifically evaluating psychoanalysis.\n\n==Summary==\n[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Ric\u0153ur argues that Freud's work should be interpreted in terms of hermeneutics.]]\n\n===Preface===\nRic\u0153ur explains that his subject is Sigmund Freud, the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], rather than psychoanalysis itself, and that he therefore avoids discussing psychoanalytic literature subsequent to Freud and dissident figures such as the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]]. He stresses that ''Freud and Philosophy'' is a work of philosophy and not a work of psychology, and compares his enterprise to those of philosophers such as Roland Dalbiez in ''Psychoanalytical Method and the Doctrine of Freud'' (1936) and Herbert Marcuse in ''Eros and Civilization'' (1955), as well as to those of the sociologist Philip Rieff in ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (1959) and the psychoanalyst [[John Fl\u00fcgel]] in ''Man, Morals and Society'' (1945). Like Marcuse, Rieff, and Fl\u00fcgel, he considers psychoanalysis an \"interpretation of culture\", but unlike them his principal concern is the \"structure of Freudian discourse\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=xi\u2013xii}}\n\nHe identifies his main purposes as explaining the nature and purpose of interpretation in psychoanalysis, showing to what understanding of human nature psychoanalytic interpretation leads, and exploring whether or how Freud's interpretation of culture is compatible with other interpretations. He notes that by discussing these questions he further explores unresolved issues related to [[symbol]]s raised in his earlier work ''The Symbolism of Evil''. He explains the structure of ''Freud and Philosophy'', which includes Book I, the \"Problematic\", Book II, the \"Analytic\", and Book III, the \"Dialectic\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=xii\u2013xiii}}\n\n===Book I: Problematic: The Placing of Freud===\nRic\u0153ur relates his discussion of Freud to the emphasis on the importance of [[language]] shared by philosophers such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Martin Heidegger]], schools of philosophy, such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], a movement founded by [[Edmund Husserl]], and English [[linguistic philosophy]], as well as disciplines such as [[New Testament]] [[exegesis]], [[comparative religion]], [[anthropology]], and psychoanalysis. He argues that there is a need for a \"comprehensive philosophy of language\" to explain its diverse purposes, and that psychoanalysts should participate in discussion of language.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=3\u20134}}\n\n[[Image:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|upright|Edmund Husserl, the founder of the philosophical movement of phenomenology, which Ric\u0153ur compares to psychoanalysis.]]\nHe maintains that one of Freud's objectives was \"a reinterpretation of all psychical productions pertaining to culture, from dreams, through art and morality, to religion\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=4}} Discussing Freud's theory of dreams, he writes that Freud used dreams as a model for all disguised expressions of human desire. He argues that psychoanalysis is concerned not with desires themselves but rather the language in which they are conveyed,{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=4\u20135}} that it involves a \"semantics of desire\",{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=6}} and that psychoanalytic concepts such as [[Repression (psychology)|repression]] and [[cathexis]] express dynamics or \"energetics\" that are \"articulated only in a semantics\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=6}} He writes that Freud's examinations of dreams and related phenomena such as humor, mythology, and religion, shows that they are meaningful and concern the way in which desires \"achieve speech\". He concludes that psychoanalysis offers a new approach to speech.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=6}} In Ric\u0153ur's view, Freud's work suggests that language resembles dreams, in the sense that it \"means something other than what it says\" and expresses \"double meaning\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=7}} According to Ric\u0153ur, dreams and phenomena comparable to them, including both [[insanity]] and human culture in general, involve \"significations where another meaning is both given and hidden in an immediate meaning\",{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=7}} which he equates with the symbol.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=7}}\n\nComparing the way in which psychoanalysis addresses \"double meaning\" to that of the [[phenomenology of religion]], he identifies both similarities and differences between the two approaches. In his view, the primary difference is that phenomena that psychoanalysis views as distorted reflections of basic desires are regarded by the phenomenology of religion as \"the revelation of the sacred\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=6\u20137}} The relative merits of these views are one of his major concerns.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=7\u20138}} He argues that psychoanalysis is concerned with \"the hermeneutic field\", which concerns double meanings and the confrontation between different forms of interpretation.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=8}} He defines \"hermeneutics\" as \"the theory of the rules that preside over an exegesis\u2014that is, over the interpretation of a particular text, or of a group of signs that may be viewed as a text\",{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=8}} adding that exegesis can be understood to include the interpretation of things analogous to texts. Seeking an appropriate definition of symbolism, he criticizes the philosopher [[Ernst Cassirer]]'s ideas about the \"symbolic function\", as put forward in ''The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'' (1923\u20131929), and makes use of the understanding of poetic imagination advanced in the philosopher [[Gaston Bachelard]]'s ''[[The Poetics of Space]]'' (1958). He proposes that \"the problem of symbolism\" is to a large extent coextensive with that of language.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=8\u201311, 15\u201316}}\n\nIn Ric\u0153ur's view, Freud's work can be compared to that of the philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. He refers to the trio as masters of the \"[[Hermeneutics of suspicion|school of suspicion]]\", arguing that despite their differences, the apparent incompatibility of their ideas, and despite caricatures or misunderstandings of their conclusions, they all view consciousness primarily as [[false consciousness]], seeking to explain its process and provide a means of deciphering it, with the objective of extending consciousness.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=17, 32\u201335}} He views all of them as being fundamentally opposed to the \"phenomenology of the sacred\" and to \"hermeneutics understood as the recollection of meaning and as the reminiscence of being\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=35}}\n[[File:Karl Marx_001.jpg|thumb|upright|Karl Marx, the founder of Marxism. Ric\u0153ur writes that Marx and Freud are masters of the \"school of suspicion\".]]\n\n===Book II: Analytic: Reading of Freud===\nRic\u0153ur explains that the second section of the book is called an \"Analytic\" because in it he is concerned with describing psychoanalysis based solely on Freud's presentation of it and discusses it in relation to other perspectives primarily to show how it differs from or is opposed to them.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=59\u201361}} He argues that psychoanalysis can be understood as both an \"energetics\", in that it entails \"an explanation of psychical phenomena through conflicts of forces\", and a \"hermeneutics\", in that it entails an \"exegesis of apparent meaning through a latent meaning\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=62}} He discusses Freud's theories of the [[death drive]], the [[defence mechanisms]], [[homosexuality]], the [[id, ego and super-ego]], [[Identification (psychology)|identification]], the [[libido]], [[metapsychology]], [[narcissism]], the [[Oedipus complex]], the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]], the [[preconscious]], the [[psychic apparatus]], [[psychosexual development]], the [[reality principle]], [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]], the [[transference]], the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]], as well as [[dreamwork]], [[Freud's seduction theory]], and the method of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]].{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=61\u201363, 67\u201379, 84\u201386, 95\u201396, 104\u2013107, 115, 119, 121\u2013122, 128\u2013132, 172, 179, 195, 216, 219}}\n\nHe suggests that in ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1899), Freud did not succeed in reconciling the \"language of meaning\" and the \"quasi-physical language\" implied by different parts of his theory. He notes that for Freud, dreams provide the \"ultimate proof\" of the existence of the unconscious, since in Freud's view the dreamwork's activity of distortion makes it necessary to attribute to the unconscious both a distinct place in the structure of the mind and its own set of laws.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=115, 119}} He considers the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious \"totally unphenomenological\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=119}} He also sees a fundamental contrast between Husserl's [[epoch\u00e9]], which involves a \"reduction ''to'' consciousness\", and the procedures of psychoanalysis, which involve a \"reduction ''of'' consciousness\". He argues that the contrast is the result of Freud's emphasis on [[instinct]], which displaces an emphasis on the role of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]] and the [[Object (philosophy)|object]] in consciousness, and observes that Freud realized that by using the concept of instinct to \"relate empirical facts\", he had moved from description to systematization, and that this involved the use of conventions, hypotheses, and postulates. He elaborates that Freud's postulates included those concerned with the operation of the psychic apparatus,{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=121\u2013123}} which in Freud's view was regulated by qualities of \"pleasure-unpleasure\", which in turn depended on \"the amounts of stimulus ... affecting mental life\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=123}}\n[[File:Nietzsche187a.jpg|thumb|upright|Friedrich Nietzsche. Ric\u0153ur argues that Nietzsche, like Freud and Marx, is a master of the \"school of suspicion\".]]\n\nObserving that, for Freud, the object of instincts must be understood in terms of their aim and not the reverse, he adds that the object may be either something external to a person or part of his or her own body. He credits Freud with making these discoveries in ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'' (1905). He provides examples of how Freud attempted to explain the process by which instincts change their objects in his theories of narcissism and identification,{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=123\u2013125, 127\u2013128}} observing that, for Freud, explaining narcissism meant showing that \"not only is the object a function of the aim of an instinct, but the ego itself is an aim of instinct\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=127}} He writes that, in Freud's view, narcissism has to be understood through its secondary expressions, such as the perversion \"in which one's own body is treated as an object of love\",{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=127}} and that the theory of narcissism helped Freud to show that displacement of narcissism is the basis of \"the formation of ideals\" and thus has implications for the theory of identification. He notes that, for Freud, identification is based in the [[oral stage]] of development and modeled after the act of devouring. He argues that it was important for Freud that he decide whether it involves a desire to possess something or a desire to be like something, since only the former could be traced to oral origins.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=127\u2013128, 131\u2013132}}\n\nFollowing earlier commentary, Ric\u0153ur maintains that Freud uses different sets of terms, including an \"observational\" set concerned with observable phenomena and a \"theoretical\" set concerned with phenomena that cannot be observed, including various hypothesized forces. He maintains that the conflict between hermeneutics and an incompatible discourse of \"economics\", involving quantities of energy, persisted in Freud's work after ''The Interpretation of Dreams'',{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=138, 140, 142\u2013143}} and concludes that in it, \"the language of force can never be overcome by the language of meaning\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=149}} According to Ric\u0153ur, psychoanalytic claims about religion are shaped by both the \"topographic-economic model\" of Freudian metapsychology and by the example of dreams.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=153\u2013154}} He argues that aspects of Freud's views on religion, such as his \"radical questioning\" of it, merit the consideration of both religious believers and non-believers, despite potential misunderstandings by both groups. He also proposes that psychoanalysis can co-exist with \"purified\" religious faith. However, he questions Freud's analogy between religion and neurosis, as well as the accuracy of some of his claims about the history of religion.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=230, 232, 245}} Freud's hypothesis of the [[death instinct]], put forward in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'' (1920), is criticized by Ric\u0153ur, who describes it as speculative and as resting on a limited factual basis. He draws connections between Freud's ideas about the death instinct and his views about the structure of the mind as presented in ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923).{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=281\u2013309}}\n\n===Book III: Dialectic: A Philosophical Interpretation of Freud===\nRic\u0153ur explains that the third section of the book is concerned with criticism of Freud's ideas. He summarizes his approach as involving first examining the validity of psychoanalysis from the standpoint of [[epistemology]], then exploring its concepts through elaborating an \"archaeology of the subject\". He adds that he then integrates this \"archaeology\" with a \"[[teleology]]\" in a way that suggests the possibility of interrelating these \"opposed hermeneutics\", and that it is because of this integration that the third section is called a \"Dialectic\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=341\u2013342}}\n[[File:Hegel portrait by Schlesinger 1831.jpg|thumb|upright|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Ric\u0153ur compares the ideas of Hegel and Freud.]]\n\nHe compares psychoanalysis to both scientific psychology and phenomenology, arguing that it cannot be made part of a \"general psychology\". He writes that most philosophers who have discussed psychoanalysis have concluded that it fails to satisfy the basic requirements of a scientific theory. He credits [[Ernest Nagel]] with presenting the strongest such argument, summarizing it as follows. It is questionable whether psychoanalysis is subject to empirical verification, since some its concepts are so vague and metaphorical, and have such an unclear relevance to behavior, that it appears impossible to either deduce specific conclusions from them or explain how psychoanalysis itself [[Falsifiability|could be refuted]]. Furthermore, there is no way of showing that psychoanalytic interpretations are valid because psychoanalytic data cannot be separated from the relationship of a given analyst to his or her patients and the suspicion that interpretations are forced upon the data by analysts is unavoidable given the lack of comparative procedures and statistical investigation. Between them, these problems make it impossible for independent inquirers to obtain the same data under carefully standardized circumstances or for psychoanalysts to establish objective procedures to decide which conflicting interpretations might be correct. Claims made by psychoanalysts about the effectiveness of treatment are unavailing, since the percentages of improvement cannot be strictly established or defined by appropriate studies, making it impossible to compare the effectiveness of psychoanalysis to other methods of treatment.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=345\u2013347}}\n\nIn Ric\u0153ur's view, such arguments are convincing so long as psychoanalysis is considered an observational science. He argues that psychoanalysts should, but have not, respond by presenting psychoanalysis as an \"interpretation\" that resembles history rather than psychology. He argues that while some psychoanalysts have tried to reformulate psychoanalysis so that it meets scientific criteria acceptable to psychologists, aspects of Freudian theory make this difficult. He refers to the attempt to assimilate psychoanalysis to observational psychology as the \"operational\" reformulation of psychoanalysis. He writes that such efforts at [[operationalization]] have not satisfied psychologists. He nevertheless argues that they are legitimate, writing that it is desirable for psychoanalysis to be evaluated by psychology and that attempts should be made to validate or invalidate its results.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=345, 347, 352, 358}} However, he emphasizes that such reformulation of psychoanalysis is \"a second operation with respect to the experience on the basis of which the Freudian concepts have arisen\" and as such can only deal with results that are \"detached from the analytic experience\".{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=358}}\n\nEmphasizing the importance of the difference between the concepts of psychoanalysis and those of behavioral psychology, Ric\u0153ur endorses the philosopher [[Stephen Toulmin]]'s argument that an explanation of human behavior in terms of motives is different in kind from an explanation of human behavior in terms of causes, and that psychoanalysis deals with motives rather than causes. He maintains that because psychoanalysis is concerned with motive concepts, there is a clear distinction between it and observational science. Criticizing the idea that psychoanalysis resembles an experimental science, he emphasizes, following the work of Jacques Lacan,{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=359\u2013360, 363, 366\u2013367}} that an analysis is based on verbal interactions between a psychoanalyst and a patient and that it reveals \"another language, dissociated from common language, and which presents itself to be deciphered through its meaningful effects\" such as symptoms and dreams.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=367}} He maintains that [[psychoanalytic theory]] is thus concerned with \"analytic experience, insofar as the latter operates in the field of speech\". He critiques Freud's theories concerning sublimation, arguing that they suffer from multiple problems and that sublimation is an \"empty concept\", as well as his views on language. He also discusses the relationship between Freud's ideas and those of the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], comparing the role that desire plays in both men's work.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|pages=375, 387, 483\u2013494, 544}}\n\n==Background and publication history==\nAccording to Ric\u0153ur, ''Freud and Philosophy'' originated in the [[Dwight H. Terry Lectureship|Terry Lectures]] given at [[Yale University]] in 1961, and was also developed in lectures given at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1835\u20131968)|University of Louvain]] in 1962.{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1970|page=xi}} The book was first published in French in May 1965 by [[\u00c9ditions du Seuil]], as part of the series ''L'Ordre philosophique'' (The Philosophic Order).{{sfn|Roudinesco|1990|page=393}}{{sfn|Roudinesco|1997|page=324}} In 1970, an English translation by Denis Savage was published in hardcover by [[Yale University Press]].

He praised Ric\u0153ur's treatment of Freud's view of religion. He compared the structure of ''Freud and Philosophy'' to that of the philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1781), and found its \"methodology and prose\" reminiscent of Hegel. However, he described the work as poorly written and sometimes unintelligible. He also faulted Ric\u0153ur for over-emphasizing symbols and for his treatment of the transference and the relationship of psychoanalysis to science. He suggested that Ric\u0153ur borrowed from Lacan, finding this apparent in Ric\u0153ur's understanding of the \"semantics of desire\".{{sfn|Chessick|1988|pages=299\u2013318}} Kovel described ''Freud and Philosophy'' as an important demonstration that Freud was a post-Hegelian thinker.{{sfn|Kovel|1991|pages=5, 240}} Whitebook argued that ''Freud and Philosophy'' was \"unsurpassed\" and disproved the view that clinical experience is necessary for understanding psychoanalytic theory.{{sfn|Whitebook|2017|page=121}}\n\nThe psychologists [[Paul Vitz]] and Malcolm Macmillan have both praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of Freud's theories about the development of the ego.{{sfn|Vitz|1988|pages=32, 230}}{{sfn|Macmillan|1997|page=446, 486\u2013487, 496}} Macmillan credited Ric\u0153ur with recognizing that Freud saw a close connection between the mental structures he outlined in ''The Ego and the Id'' and the instinctual theory he put forward in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''. He endorsed Ric\u0153ur's criticism of the concept of sublimation and his questioning of the idea that identification has an oral origin.{{sfn|Macmillan|1997|page=446, 486\u2013487, 496}} Ric\u0153ur's hermeneutic approach to psychoanalysis has been discussed by the historians [[Peter Gay]] and Roger Smith.{{sfn|Gay|1995|page=745}}{{sfn|Smith|1997|page=856}} Gay described ''Freud and Philosophy'' as a \"highly disciplined study\", but noted his disagreement with the work.{{sfn|Gay|1995|page=745}} Smith credited Ric\u0153ur with demonstrating the merits of a hermeneutic approach to Freud.{{sfn|Smith|1997|page=856}} The pastoral counselor Kirk A.

They argued that Ric\u0153ur espoused a form of \"extreme subjectivism\" which implies that psychoanalytic theories cannot be tested empirically or shown to be mistaken. They suggested that Freud would have rejected Ric\u0153ur's conclusions and that few psychologists or psychoanalysts would accept them. They also argued that if Ric\u0153ur's conclusions were to be accepted, this would further undermine psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Eysenck|Wilson|1976|pages=393\u2013395}} Kline wrote that Ric\u0153ur might be correct that psychoanalysis cannot be dealt with through experiments based on quantifiable evidence, but argued that if he is, this shows that psychoanalytic theory is not scientific.{{sfn|Kline|1995|page=4}} The sociologist [[John Thompson (sociologist)|John Thompson]] considered Ric\u0153ur's views about the role of language and meaning in psychoanalysis similar to those of Lacan. While Thompson praised ''Freud and Philosophy'', he believed that Ric\u0153ur failed to resolve the \"question of the scientific status of psychoanalysis\" in the work. He and Ric\u0153ur both noted that Ric\u0153ur took a different approach to the issue in his essay \"The question of proof in Freud's psychoanalytic writings\", which was published in ''[[Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences]]'' (1981).{{sfn|Thompson|1981|pages=3, 7, 24}}{{sfn|Ric\u0153ur|1981|page=38}}\n\nThe philosopher [[Richard J. Bernstein]] credited Ric\u0153ur with showing that there was always a tension in Freud's thinking between an emphasis on \"energetics\" and an emphasis on \"hermeneutics\", and with using his discussion of Hegel to explain aspects of Freud's work. However, he noted that Ric\u0153ur presented only one possible philosophical interpretation of Freud, and suggested that the section of ''Freud and Philosophy'' in which he did so was the weakest part of the book. He argued that Ric\u0153ur's interpretation of Freud suffered from \"tensions and unresolved issues\". He also remained unconvinced by Ric\u0153ur's critique of Freud's views on religion.{{sfn|Bernstein|2013|pages=130\u2013139}} Ric\u0153ur has also been criticized by the philosophers [[Ronald de Sousa]], Geoff Waite, and [[Todd Dufresne]].{{sfnm|1a1=De Sousa|1y=1995|1pp=85, 340|2a1=Waite|2y=1996|2p=106|3a1=Dufresne|3y=2000|3pp=122\u2013123, 126|4a1=Dufresne|4y=2011|4p=14}} De Sousa maintained that Ric\u0153ur was one of several commentators on Freud to have incorrectly argued that Freud, by basing the method of psychoanalysis on an extension of the principle of determinism from the physical to the mental realm, confused determinism and meaningfulness.{{sfn|De Sousa|1995|pages=85, 340}} Waite described Ric\u0153ur's claim that Freud, Marx, and Nietzsche form a \"school of suspicion\" as \"famous\" but misleading.{{sfn|Waite|1996|page=106}} Dufresne considered Ric\u0153ur's interpretation of Freud evenhanded and in some ways superior to Lacan's. He credited Ric\u0153ur with discussing important points that are rarely addressed, and complimented his interpretation of the concept of the death drive. However, he concluded that Ric\u0153ur's attempt to \"oppose and then synthesize\" Freud and Hegel was already dated when ''Freud and Philosophy'' was published.{{sfn|Dufresne|2000|pages=122\u2013123, 126}} He noted that thinkers such Marcuse, Lacan, [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Judith Butler]] have produced interpretations of ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' irreconcilable with Ric\u0153ur's.{{sfn|Dufresne|2011|page=14}}\n\n===Reception in France===\nAccording to the historian and psychoanalyst [[\u00c9lisabeth Roudinesco]], Ric\u0153ur first presented the interpretation of Freud later expounded in ''Freud and Philosophy'' at a colloquium held in France in 1960.

At the request of the philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], ''Critique'' published a reply by Ric\u0153ur, in which he denied the accusation and explained that he had completed the outline of his interpretation of Freud before having read Lacan. Roudinesco dismisses the charge that Ric\u0153ur had borrowed Lacan's ideas, arguing that he could not have done so given his failure to understand them.{{sfn|Roudinesco|1990|pages=394\u2013396}}\n\nRoudinesco states that ''Freud and Philosophy'' received a negative review in ''[[Les Temps modernes]]'' from Michel Tort, who argued that the book was obscurantist and reactionary, that Ric\u0153ur's Christian and phenomenological approach to understanding Freud's texts was unhelpful and obsolete, and that Lacan's approach to psychoanalysis was superior to that of Ric\u0153ur.{{sfn|Roudinesco|1990|pages=396\u2013397}} Vinicio Busacchi wrote that Tort's discussion of ''Freud and Philosophy'' was \"fallacious and calumnious\" and that the accusation of plagiarism against Ric\u0153ur was false.{{sfn|Busacchi|2016|pages=56\u201371}}\n\nOthers who responded to the book in France include the philosopher [[Louis Althusser]]'s students, whose view of the work was negative,{{sfn|Boer|2005|pages=69\u201371}} as well as [[Deleuze and Guattari]];{{sfn|Genosko|2002|page=121}}{{sfn|Michel|2015|pages=75, 96}} Ric\u0153ur's arguments about the death instinct influenced their joint work ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972).{{sfn|Genosko|2002|page=121}} However, they were critical of Ric\u0153ur's interpretation of Freud's theory of culture.{{sfn|Michel|2015|pages=75, 96}} After Ric\u0153ur's death in 2005, the philosopher [[Jonathan R\u00e9e]] wrote that ''Freud and Philosophy'' was a \"powerful\" book that had been \"scandalously neglected in France\".{{sfn|R\u00e9e|2005}}\n\n===Reviews in scientific and academic journals===\n''Freud and Philosophy'' received positive reviews in academic journals written in English.

Hems in ''[[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]]''.{{sfn|Hems|1971|page=135}}\n\nKnapp described the book as \"thoughtful, searching, and comprehensive\". He wrote that Ric\u0153ur had broad knowledge of both philosophy and psychoanalysis. He credited him with carefully distinguishing between different aspects of Freud's work and convincingly criticizing Freud's hypotheses about language and views about religion. He also believed that he revealed Freud's \"lack of a broad view of symbolic functioning\", exposed confusions in Freud's thought, such as that between \"force\" as a metaphorical term and \"force\" as a reference to observable phenomena, and showed that psychoanalysis resembles historical science and phenomenology rather than science as understood by positivism. He praised his discussion of Toulmin. However, he suggested that integrating Freud's views about meaning with Freud's ideas about \"drive energy\" would \"require a more comprehensive psychosomatic theory of emotion\" than that provided by Ric\u0153ur, and that ''Freud and Philosophy'' was sometimes confused and presented debatable conclusions. He compared the book to Brown's ''Life Against Death''.{{sfn|Knapp|1971|pages=978\u2013979}} Gargiulo described the book as \"a provocative philosophical enterprise and a masterful reading of Freud\" and \"a text of extraordinary complexity and sensitivity\". He compared Ric\u0153ur's work to that of Rieff, and credited him with showing that \"desire has a semantics\" and that psychoanalysis \"cannot be verified as in physical and experimental sciences\". He praised his discussions of sublimation and symbols. However, he criticized Ric\u0153ur's discussion of the reality principle.{{sfn|Gargiulo|1971|pages=295\u2013301}}\n\nVivas described the book as the most thorough study of Freudian theory that he was aware of. He considered it similar, but also superior to, ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist''. He praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of Freud's views on religion, crediting him with convincingly criticizing and correcting them. However, while finding Ric\u0153ur's views on religion preferable to Freud's, he nevertheless disagreed with them. He also expressed uncertainty about whether Ric\u0153ur had resolved the issue of the scientific status of psychoanalysis, and questioned the value of Ric\u0153ur's discussion of the reasons for the difficulty of resolving whether the processes postulated by psychoanalysis actually exist.{{sfn|Vivas|1971|pages=310\u2013314}} Slaughter suggested that the book might be the best commentary on Freud ever written, maintaining that it not only assisted in the understanding of Freud but had implications for the practice of philosophy. However, he criticized Ric\u0153ur's discussion of Freud's views on religion, believing that Ric\u0153ur interrupted his discussion of Freud by presenting his personal beliefs.{{sfn|Slaughter|1972|pages=56\u201358}}\n\nGrolnick understood the work as \"a stage in the development of a comprehensive religious philosophy\". He credited Ric\u0153ur with placing psychoanalysis in a larger historical and intellectual context and relating it to contemporary cultural trends, showing broad knowledge of philosophy, literature, and religion, and providing a useful discussion of the development of Freud's work. He praised Ric\u0153ur's exploration of topics such as narcissism, identification, sublimation, and the reality principle, and believed that he showed the flaws of some of Freud's views on art, culture, and religion. He complimented Ric\u0153ur for his comparison of psychoanalysis and phenomenology. However, he wrote that psychoanalysts might disagree with Ric\u0153ur's assessment of the scientific status of psychoanalysis, and that some of Ric\u0153ur's criticisms of Freud were unoriginal, having been made within psychoanalysis itself.{{sfn|Grolnick|1972|pages=436\u2013443}} Reider described the work as \"one of the most important books on the theory of psychoanalysis in the last two decades\". He praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of Freud, crediting him with noting respects in which Freud's views were illogical, inconsistent, or incomplete, especially where religion was concerned. He considered Ric\u0153ur's critique of Freud superior to anything written by psychoanalysts. He also praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of \"symbols and symbolization\" and his criticism of Nagel. However, he wrote that Ric\u0153ur's \"preoccupation with religion, with the sacred, and his conclusion that psychoanalyis is teleological contain weighty evidence of his acceptance of idealism\".{{sfn|Reider|1972|pages=142\u2013144}}\n\nIhde maintained that the book was primarily about language and hermeneutics and that Ric\u0153ur's discussion of Freud was often \"tedious\". He credited Ric\u0153ur with using the Freudian ideas to correct phenomenology. He noted that the book was \"Ric\u0153ur's most controversial work\", and that it was criticized by adherents of phenomenology, who argued that Ric\u0153ur ignored the contributions of \"phenomenological-existentialist psychologists\". He rejected such criticisms. He also argued that despite the charge that Ric\u0153ur had borrowed ideas from Lacan, ''Freud and Philosophy'' reflected themes, such as the importance of symbols, that Ric\u0153ur had explored in earlier works such as ''The Symbolism of Evil''.{{sfn|Ihde|1972|pages=138\u2013139}}\n\nSlater considered the book impressive, calling it the first detailed study \"by a professional philosopher of the development of Freud's thought and of psychoanalytical theory in all the stages of its growth\". He praised Ric\u0153ur's discussion of the development of Freud's ideas. However, he found it unclear whether Ric\u0153ur \"shows successfully on what grounds psychoanalysis could subjected to any criticism whatsoever\". He suggested that Ric\u0153ur's view of the interactions between psychoanalysts and their patients misleadingly suggested that there is no way for third parties to determine the truth or untruth of the claims made by the analysts about their patients. He believed that this undermined their credibility.{{sfn|Slater|1972|pages=455\u2013457}}\n\nStack described the book as \"illuminating and profound\". He credited Ric\u0153ur with providing \"the most complete philosophical interpretation\" of psychoanalysis to date, demonstrating \"the incompleteness of Freud's conception of symbols\", carefully discussing Freud's view of instinct, convincingly criticizing Freud's theorizing about the death instinct, and usefully comparing \"Hegel's phenomenology of desire and Freudian theory\". He praised Ric\u0153ur's comparison of psychoanalysis and phenomenology, suggesting that he showed that they are ultimately incompatible despite the similarities between them. While he believed that Ric\u0153ur's insights undermined Freud's hostility to religion, he questioned Ric\u0153ur's attempt to find common ground between Freud and the phenomenology of religion. He was also unconvinced by Ric\u0153ur's attempt to demonstrate \"an implicit teleology in psychoanalysis\".{{sfn|Stack|1973|pages=318\u2013322}}\n\nIn ''Religious Studies Review'', Lowe credited Ric\u0153ur with providing an interesting perspective on psychoanalysis. He compared Ric\u0153ur's views to those of Browning. He praised his comparison of psychoanalysis and phenomenology, crediting him with showing why it is wrong to absorb psychoanalysis into phenomenology or identify the two. He also praised his discussion of Freud's ideas in relation to those of Hegel. He wrote that he had influenced discussions of the relevance of Freud to theology, for example in his description of a teleological aspect to Freudian thought. However, he suggested that ''Freud and Philosophy'' contained unusual language.{{sfn|Lowe|1978|pages=246\u2013254}} Hems wrote that the book could be seen as either \"a work of formidable thoroughness\" or one of \"irksome prolixity\", depending on one's point of view. He questioned whether Ric\u0153ur's attempt to reinterpret Freud was successful.{{sfn|Hems|1971|page=135}}\n\n===Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum's criticism===\nThe philosopher [[Adolf Gr\u00fcnbaum]] has discussed ''Freud and Philosophy'' in works such as ''[[The Foundations of Psychoanalysis]]'' (1984) and ''[[Validation in the Clinical Theory of Psychoanalysis]]'' (1993).{{sfn|Gr\u00fcnbaum|1985|pages=43\u201369, 73}}{{sfn|Gr\u00fcnbaum|1993|pages=114\u2013116}} In ''The Foundations of Psychoanalysis'', he criticized Ric\u0153ur's hermeneutic interpretation of Freud, arguing that Ric\u0153ur incorrectly limited the relevance of psychoanalytic theory to verbal statements made during analytic therapy. He accused Ric\u0153ur of wanting to protect his hermeneutic understanding of psychoanalysis from scientific examination and criticism, and maintained that Ric\u0153ur's arguments rested on an untenable dichotomy between theory and observation and that he took a reductive form of [[behaviorism]] as his model of scientific psychology. He argued that Ric\u0153ur's view that psychoanalysis provides a \"semantics of desire\" mistakenly equates symptoms with linguistic representations of their causes, and accused Ric\u0153ur of endorsing Lacan's \"obfuscating\" view that a symptom resembles \"a language whose speech must be realized\". However, Gr\u00fcnbaum gave Ric\u0153ur credit for later, in ''Hermeneutics and the Human Sciences'', reassessing his views by abandoning the dichotomy between reasons and causes.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcnbaum|1985|pages=43\u201369, 73}}\n\nGr\u00fcnbaum's criticisms of Ric\u0153ur have been endorsed, in whole or in part, by the psychologist [[Robert R. Holt]],{{sfn|Holt|1989|pages=314\u2013316}} the psychoanalyst [[Jonathan Lear]],{{sfn|Lear|1992|page=49}} the historian Paul Robinson,{{sfn|Robinson|1993|pages=73, 195, 265}} and the critic [[Frederick Crews]].{{sfn|Crews|1999|page=xxix}} Holt dismissed ''Freud and Philosophy'', arguing that it was only superficially impressive, that parts of it were unreadable, and that Ric\u0153ur used vague or inappropriately metaphorical language. He also maintained that Ric\u0153ur's view that psychoanalysis is not a science depended on unoriginal arguments. Though he noted that Ric\u0153ur's views were supported by some psychoanalysts, he argued that if Ric\u0153ur's view that psychoanalysis does not have to make predictions and is not subject to \"substantial constraints\" were correct, it would mean the end of psychoanalysis.{{sfn|Holt|1989|pages=314\u2013316}} Lear criticized ''Freud and Philosophy'', blaming it, along with ''Knowledge and Human Interests'', for convincing some psychoanalysts that reasons cannot be causes.{{sfn|Lear|1992|page=49}} Robinson described ''Freud and Philosophy'' as a classic portrayal of Freud as a hermeneutician and a philosopher similar to Nietzsche. He compared Ric\u0153ur's views to those of Derrida. Although he believed that there was some truth to them, he argued that Ric\u0153ur's arguments obscured Freud's identification with the scientific tradition. He credited Gr\u00fcnbaum with showing that Ric\u0153ur was misguided in this respect.{{sfn|Robinson|1993|pages=73, 195, 265}} Crews criticized Ric\u0153ur for helping to inspire unscientific defenses of Freud and psychoanalysis and for misunderstanding Freud.{{sfn|Crews|1999|page=xxix}} The philosopher Philippe Lacour suggested that the debate between Gr\u00fcnbaum and Ric\u0153ur suffered from the fact that, while Gr\u00fcnbaum read and responded to Ric\u0153ur's writings, it was unclear whether Ric\u0153ur paid any attention to Gr\u00fcnbaum.{{sfn|Lacour|2016|pages=120\u2013147}}\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Freud and His Critics]]''\n* ''[[Love and Its Place in Nature]]''\n* ''[[Philosophical Essays on Freud]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n;Books\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Abramson |first1=Jeffrey B. |title=Liberation and Its Limits: The Moral and Political Thought of Freud |publisher=[[Beacon Press]] |location=Boston |year=1986 |isbn=0-8070-2913-0 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/liberationitslim0000abra }}\n* {{cite book |last1=Crews |first1=Frederick |title=Unauthorized Freud: Doubters Confront a Legend |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-14-028017-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=De Sousa |first1=Ronald |title=The Rationality of Emotion |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1995 |isbn=0-262-54057-6 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Dufresne|first1=Todd |title=Tales From the Freudian Crypt: The Death Drive in Text and Context |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |location=Stanford, California |year=2000 |isbn=0-8047-3885-8 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Dufresne|first1=Todd |chapter=Introduction |editor-last1=Dufresne|editor-first1=Todd |title=Beyond the Pleasure Principle |publisher=[[Broadview Press|Broadview Editions]] |location=Toronto |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-55111-994-6 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Eysenck|first1=Hans J. |last2=Wilson|first2=Glenn D. |chapter=Epilogue |editor-last1=Eysenck|editor-first1=Hans |editor-last2=Wilson|editor-first2=Glenn D. |title=The Experimental Study of Freudian Theories |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen & Co Ltd]] |location=London |year=1976 |isbn=0-416-70470-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Gay|first1=Peter |title=Freud: A Life for Our Time |publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Papermac]] |location=Harmondsworth |year=1995 |isbn=0-333-48638-2 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Genosko|first1=Gary |title=F\u00e9lix Guattari: An Aberrant Introduction |publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]] |location=London |year=2002 |isbn=0-8264-6034-8 |oclc= |doi= |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Grayling |first1=A.
