When Ben finds the Omnitrix, a mysterious watch that transforms him into 10 different aliens, a world of extraterrestrial superpowers opens up to him. The series is produced by Cartoon Network Studios and created and executive produced by Man of Action Entertainment (''Big Hero 6'', ''Generator Rex'' and the original four ''Ben 10'' shows in their shared continuity), with John Fang (''Mixels'', ''Generator Rex'') on board as supervising producer.\n\n===Season 1 (2017)===\nTen-year-old Ben Tennyson has spent his summer vacation traveling across the country with his cousin Gwen and Grandpa Max, in an RV nicknamed the Rustbucket. However, after coming across a strange high-tech watch known as the Omnitrix, which enables him to transform into 10 alien heroes, he finds himself in the position of a superhero. At each place his family stops, Ben goes from trying to find a source of entertainment to doing battle against supervillains such as the mad scientist Dr. Animo, the dark sorcerer Hex, the psychotic clown Zombozo, the technology-loathing Steam-Smythe, and the emotionless Weatherheads, amongst other threats both big and small. Despite having lots to learn, he hones his hero skills with Gwen and Max's help.\n\nWhile battling one of Animo's mutant creations during a trip to Portland, Ben unlocks an 11th alien he names Gax, a Chimera Sui Generis with laser vision and great strength. However, unlocking this form seems to have an odd effect on the Omnitrix, leaving him unable to control his transformations. To determine the source of this issue, Max calls in his old friend Phil. Ben finds himself under attack from three alien bounty hunters named Tetrax, Kraab, and Sixsix. While he's able to fend them off, he meets a mysterious aged Chimera Sui Generis calling himself \"Vil\", who trains Ben to use Gax's powers. However, it turns out \"Vil\" and Gax are the two halves of alien conqueror Vilgax, who tricks Ben into freeing Gax from the Omnitrix and subsequently absorbs Gax's power to restore himself to full strength. The bounty hunter trio were hired to prevent Vilgax from reforming and thus team up with Ben to prevent the conqueror from destroying the watch. Vilgax wins this battle, dispatching the hunters and leaving Ben rapidly changing between his alien forms and, according to Phil, unable to return to human form.\n\nVilgax intends to use lava from Mount Megaladon to recharge his ship and restart his conquering spree. Ben, regardless of his current state, engages Vilgax in battle. The tentacle-faced villain becomes interested in possessing the Omnitrix rather than destroying it, after seeing what it can do to a weak human boy like Ben. While at first hampered by his inability to predict which form he'll become next, Ben is able to turn the tides and defeat Vilgax by upgrading the Omnitrix, supposedly sacrificing the Galvanic Mechamorph. Ben makes it out alive and Vilgax is defeated.\n\n===Season 2 (2018)===\nThe Tennysons continue to visit some of America's greatest tourist spots, as Ben continues to take his hero career to new heights. As his enemies grow stronger, Ben is aided by the appearance of new \"Omni-Enhanced\" versions of his alien forms, who possess a strange blue energy that packs a major punch in battle. He also has unlocked a new alien hero whom he dubs \"Shock Rock\", whose form is made up of the same blue energy.\n\nMeanwhile, Vilgax, still seeking a method to escape Earth, forms alliances with some of Ben's enemies to harness the Omnitrix's power. Team Tennyson make it their mission to defeat Vilgax and stop his devious machinations from seeing light.\n\nHowever, following a battle with Vilgax's war-bot, Ben learns that his new forms are a sign of a bigger threat. Shock Rock is a Fulmini, whose DNA pod replaced Upgrade following his sacrifice. The Fulmini Empire and their leader, the High Override, have been manipulating Ben to invade Earth and use the Omnitrix as a gateway. Ben and Vilgax team up, entering the Omnitrix and allying with a heroic fusion between his DNA and Upgrade's damaged DNA calling itself Glitch. Though the High Override banishes Vilgax to the Null Void, Team Tennyson are able to free Ben from his control and purge the Fulmini from the watch, causing it to reboot. Glitch survives the reboot by escaping the Omnitrix, joining the family.   And also subscribe to Mr.penguin use link\u2014-> https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQtiR4DFqye_Trblr9QDauw\n\n===Season 3 (2019)===\nAfter a serious battle with the High Override, Glitch merges with the Rustbuggy and becomes part of the Tennyson family. Ben gets frustrated when the Omnitrix reboots for a week, but it activates just as the Tennyson family is about to do some world traveling. Phil has created a helicopter called the \"Omni-Copter\" for the Tennyson Trio so they can travel around the world. The reboot reveals three new aliens, Rath, Slapback, and Humungosaur, who replace Grey Matter, Overflow, and Wildvine. With Vilgax in the Null Void, Ben has a new enemy to fight: Kevin Levin, who has an Omnitrix of his own, called the \"AntiTrix\", which gives him access to altered versions of Ben's aliens. A mysterious villain called the Forever Knight gathers up Ben's villains for a common cause. As revealed in the two-part finale ''Roundabout'', his goal is to go back in time and prevent alien signals from contacting Earth.\n\nThroughout the season, the Forever Knight tests Team Tennyson's enemies to determine those he needs for this goal: the final roster consist of Kevin, Charmcaster, Vin Ethanol, Billy Billions, Simon Sez, and a delusional Ben. While searching for Ben, Phil gifts Gwen with a robot cat suit. Kevin, angry at the Forever Knight for discarding him, teams up with Gwen to help Ben prevent the Forever Knight from altering history. In the end, both Kevin and the Knight end up trapped through time and space.\n\nBen and Gwen make it back to the present and head back to America aboard the Omni-Copter alongside Grandpa Max, Phil, Vin, and Simon, the latter two being convinced to join Team Tennyson. Also, Billy and Charmcaster get taken into custody.\n\n=== Season 4 (2020) ===\n\nIn the start of Season 4, Ben's Omnitrix is unlocked in a armored version in which he unlocks Jetray ,who replaces Stinkfly . Kevin's AntiTrix is on a different armored version of it, unlocking Ultimate Kevin, a powerful version of Kevin (voiced by Greg Cipes).\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Ben 10 characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Ben Tennyson]] (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) \u2013 The ten-year-old cousin of Gwen and grandson of Max Tennyson.

When Ben finds the Omnitrix, a mysterious watch that transforms him into 10 different aliens, a world of extraterrestrial superpowers opens up to him. The series is produced by Cartoon Network Studios and created and executive produced by Man of Action Entertainment (''Big Hero 6'', ''Generator Rex'' and the original four ''Ben 10'' shows in their shared continuity), with John Fang (''Mixels'', ''Generator Rex'') on board as supervising producer.\n\n===Season 1 (2017)===\nTen-year-old Ben Tennyson has spent his summer vacation traveling across the country with his cousin Gwen and Grandpa Max, in an RV nicknamed the Rustbucket. However, after coming across a strange high-tech watch known as the Omnitrix, which enables him to transform into 10 alien heroes, he finds himself in the position of a superhero. At each place his family stops, Ben goes from trying to find a source of entertainment to doing battle against supervillains such as the mad scientist Dr. Animo, the dark sorcerer Hex, the psychotic clown Zombozo, the technology-loathing Steam-Smythe, and the emotionless Weatherheads, amongst other threats both big and small. Despite having lots to learn, he hones his hero skills with Gwen and Max's help.\n\nWhile battling one of Animo's mutant creations during a trip to Portland, Ben unlocks an 11th alien he names Gax, a Chimera Sui Generis with laser vision and great strength. However, unlocking this form seems to have an odd effect on the Omnitrix, leaving him unable to control his transformations. To determine the source of this issue, Max calls in his old friend Phil. Ben finds himself under attack from three alien bounty hunters named Tetrax, Kraab, and Sixsix. While he's able to fend them off, he meets a mysterious aged Chimera Sui Generis calling himself \"Vil\", who trains Ben to use Gax's powers. However, it turns out \"Vil\" and Gax are the two halves of alien conqueror Vilgax, who tricks Ben into freeing Gax from the Omnitrix and subsequently absorbs Gax's power to restore himself to full strength. The bounty hunter trio were hired to prevent Vilgax from reforming and thus team up with Ben to prevent the conqueror from destroying the watch. Vilgax wins this battle, dispatching the hunters and leaving Ben rapidly changing between his alien forms and, according to Phil, unable to return to human form.\n\nVilgax intends to use lava from Mount Megaladon to recharge his ship and restart his conquering spree. Ben, regardless of his current state, engages Vilgax in battle. The tentacle-faced villain becomes interested in possessing the Omnitrix rather than destroying it, after seeing what it can do to a weak human boy like Ben. While at first hampered by his inability to predict which form he'll become next, Ben is able to turn the tides and defeat Vilgax by upgrading the Omnitrix, supposedly sacrificing the Galvanic Mechamorph. Ben makes it out alive and Vilgax is defeated.\n\n===Season 2 (2018)===\nThe Tennysons continue to visit some of America's greatest tourist spots, as Ben continues to take his hero career to new heights. As his enemies grow stronger, Ben is aided by the appearance of new \"Omni-Enhanced\" versions of his alien forms, who possess a strange blue energy that packs a major punch in battle. He also has unlocked a new alien hero whom he dubs \"Shock Rock\", whose form is made up of the same blue energy.\n\nMeanwhile, Vilgax, still seeking a method to escape Earth, forms alliances with some of Ben's enemies to harness the Omnitrix's power. Team Tennyson make it their mission to defeat Vilgax and stop his devious machinations from seeing light.\n\nHowever, following a battle with Vilgax's war-bot, Ben learns that his new forms are a sign of a bigger threat. Shock Rock is a Fulmini, whose DNA pod replaced Upgrade following his sacrifice. The Fulmini Empire and their leader, the High Override, have been manipulating Ben to invade Earth and use the Omnitrix as a gateway. Ben and Vilgax team up, entering the Omnitrix and allying with a heroic fusion between his DNA and Upgrade's damaged DNA calling itself Glitch. Though the High Override banishes Vilgax to the Null Void, Team Tennyson are able to free Ben from his control and purge the Fulmini from the watch, causing it to reboot. Glitch survives the reboot by escaping the Omnitrix, joining the family.\n\n===Season 3 (2019)===\nAfter a serious battle with the High Override, Glitch merges with the Rustbuggy and becomes part of the Tennyson family. Ben gets frustrated when the Omnitrix reboots for a week, but it activates just as the Tennyson family is about to do some world traveling. Phil has created a helicopter called the \"Omni-Copter\" for the Tennyson Trio so they can travel around the world. The reboot reveals three new aliens, Rath, Slapback, and Humungosaur, who replace Grey Matter, Overflow, and Wildvine. With Vilgax in the Null Void, Ben has a new enemy to fight: Kevin Levin, who has an Omnitrix of his own, called the \"AntiTrix\", which gives him access to altered versions of Ben's aliens. A mysterious villain called the Forever Knight gathers up Ben's villains for a common cause. As revealed in the two-part finale ''Roundabout'', his goal is to go back in time and prevent alien signals from contacting Earth.\n\nThroughout the season, the Forever Knight tests Team Tennyson's enemies to determine those he needs for this goal: the final roster consist of Kevin, Charmcaster, Vin Ethanol, Billy Billions, Simon Sez, and a delusional Ben. While searching for Ben, Phil gifts Gwen with a robot cat suit. Kevin, angry at the Forever Knight for discarding him, teams up with Gwen to help Ben prevent the Forever Knight from altering history. In the end, both Kevin and the Knight end up trapped through time and space.\n\nBen and Gwen make it back to the present and head back to America aboard the Omni-Copter alongside Grandpa Max, Phil, Vin, and Simon, the latter two being convinced to join Team Tennyson. Also, Billy and Charmcaster get taken into custody.\n\n=== Season 4 (2020) ===\n\nIn the start of Season 4, Ben's Omnitrix is unlocked in a armored version in which he unlocks Jetray ,who replaces Stinkfly . Kevin's AntiTrix is on a different armored version of it, unlocking Ultimate Kevin, a powerful version of Kevin (voiced by Greg Cipes).\n\n==Characters==\n{{main|List of Ben 10 characters}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Ben Tennyson]] (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]) \u2013 The ten-year-old cousin of Gwen and grandson of Max Tennyson.

A [[United States Senator|United States senator]] from [[Minnesota]] (1964\u20131976), he was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Walter Mondale presidential campaign, 1984|nominee]] in the [[United States presidential election of 1984]], but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] [[Landslide victory|landslide]]. Reagan won 49 states while Mondale carried his home state of [[Minnesota]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. In October 2002, Mondale became the last-minute choice of the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] to run for [[2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Senate]] after the death of Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], but was defeated by [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living]] former U.S. vice president after the death of [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2018.\n\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], and graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1951 after attending [[Macalester College]]. He then served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] before earning a [[law degree]] in 1956. He married [[Joan Mondale|Joan Adams]] in 1955. Working as a lawyer in [[Minneapolis]], Mondale was appointed [[Minnesota Attorney General]] in 1960 by Governor [[Orville Freeman]] and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] upon the resignation of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] following Humphrey's election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported [[consumer protection]], [[fair housing]], [[tax reform]], and the [[desegregation]] of schools. Importantly, he served as a member of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (\"[[Church Committee]]\").<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm Staff Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003144646/http://www.fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm |date=October 3, 2009 }} of Church Committee, archived by [[Federation of American Scientists]], Retrieved October 22, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], [[Jimmy Carter]], the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Mondale as his vice-presidential running mate. The Carter\u2013Mondale ticket defeated incumbent president [[Gerald Ford]] and his vice presidential running mate, [[Bob Dole]]. Carter and Mondale's time in office was marred by a worsening economy and they lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 election]] to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a [[nuclear freeze]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], an increase in taxes, and a reduction of [[U.S. public debt]]. His vice presidential nominee was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a Congresswoman from [[New York (state)|New York]], the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush.\n\nAfter his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (1986\u201393). President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Mondale [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] in 1993; he retired in 1996. In [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2002|2002]], Mondale ran for his old Senate seat, agreeing to be the last-minute replacement for Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], who died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. He then returned to working at Dorsey & Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Up Close with Walter Mondale|url=https://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106134345/http://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2015|website=UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA FOUNDATION|publisher=University of Minnesota|access-date=May 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], to Claribel Hope (n\u00e9e Cowan), a part-time music teacher, and Theodore Sigvaard Mondale, a [[Methodist]] minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 |title=American President: Walter Mondale |publisher=Millercenter.org |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704011945/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 |archivedate=July 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389066/Walter-Mondale |title=Walter Mondale|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Walter_Mondale.htm |title=Walter F.

Unlike his father, a fervent liberal, he was not a crusader for the New Deal. Instead he realized the Democratic base (especially ethnic blue-collar workers) was gradually moving to the right and he worked to keep their support.<ref>Steven M.

[[NASA]] Administrator [[James E. Webb]] secured President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight. NASA's procedure called for Deputy Administrator (and de facto general manager) [[Robert C. Seamans]] to appoint and oversee an investigative panel.\n\nIn February, a reporter leaked to Mondale the existence of [[Phillips Report|an internal NASA report]] issued in 1965 by Apollo program director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], detailing management, cost, delivery, and quality problems of the Apollo prime contractor [[North American Aviation]]. In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative. Seamans had passed along to Webb neither the written report nor the briefing presentation made to him in January 1966 by Phillips and Phillips's boss, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]].<ref name=\"wamu\">{{Cite episode|title=Washington Goes to the Moon (Part 2) |url=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|accessdate=March 15, 2011|series=Soundprint |network=NPR|station=WAMU 88.5 FM|location=Washington D.C.|airdate=May 24, 2001|transcript=yes |transcripturl=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/d/programs/special/moon/fire_show.txt|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728170238/http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|archivedate=July 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBoth Seamans and Mueller had also been called to testify at this session. Mueller denied the report's existence, though he must have been aware of it, as he had appended his own strongly worded letter to the copy sent to North American president [[Lee Atwood]].<ref name=\"phillips_report\">{{cite web|last=Garber|first=Steve|title=NASA Apollo Mission Apollo-1 \u2013 Phillips Report |publisher=NASA History Office|date=February 3, 2003|url=https://history.nasa.gov/Apollo204/phillip1.html|accessdate=April 14, 2010}}</ref>\n\nSeamans was afraid Mondale might be in possession of a copy (he was not), so he admitted that NASA often reviewed its contractors' performance, with both positive and negative results, but claimed that was nothing extraordinary. Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the \"Phillips Report\" existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time.<ref name=\"wamu\"/>\n\nThe controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of three of Mondale's fellow committee members, Republicans [[Margaret Chase Smith]], [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]]) to include the second-guessing of NASA's original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend. The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.\n\nWhile the Committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA's own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967), that \"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident\".

The ticket was narrowly elected on November 2, 1976, and Mondale was inaugurated as [[Vice President of the United States]] on January 20, 1977. He became the fourth vice president in four years, after [[Spiro Agnew]] (1969\u201373), [[Gerald Ford]] (1973\u201374), and [[Nelson Rockefeller]] (1974\u201377).\n\nUnder Carter, Mondale traveled extensively throughout the nation and the world advocating the administration's foreign policy. His travels also included a visit to the {{USS|Midway|CV-41}}, which was on station at the time in the Indian Ocean, during the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an \"activist Vice President.\" He began the tradition of weekly lunches with the president, which continues to this day. More importantly, he expanded the vice president's role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration. Subsequent vice presidents followed this model.<ref>Paul Kengor, ''Wreath Layer or Policy Player: The Vice President's Role in Foreign Policy'' (2000) p. 85</ref>\n\n===1980 election===\n{{Further|U.S. presidential election, 1976 |U.S. presidential election, 1980}}\n[[File:Mondale and Carter.JPG|thumb|Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter, in front of Presidential helicopter [[Marine One]] in January 1979]]\nCarter and Mondale were renominated at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]], but soundly lost to the Republican ticket of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. That year, Mondale opened the [[XIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]].\n\nCarter and Mondale are the longest-living post-presidential team in American history. On May 23, 2006, they had been out of office for 9,254 days (25 years, 4 months and 3 days), surpassing the former record established by President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]], both of whom died on July 4, 1826. On September 8, 2012, Carter surpassed [[Herbert Hoover]] as the president with the longest retirement from office. On April 23, 2014, Mondale surpassed [[Richard Nixon]] as the vice president with the longest retirement from office at 12,146 days (33 years, 3 months and 3 days). With [[George H. W.

His opposition included Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] and Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]]. Hart won the New Hampshire primary in March, but Mondale had much of the party leadership behind him. To great effect, Mondale used the [[Wendy's]] slogan \"[[Where's the beef?]]\" to describe Hart's policies as lacking depth. Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates on the first ballot.\n\n[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Mondale celebrates victories in the 1984 primaries with Carter.]]\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Mexican American, as finalists.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html Trying to Win the Peace], by Even Thomas, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> Others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival [[Gary Hart]]. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being [[pro-choice]]. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first [[Italian American]] to reach that level in American politics.\n\nWhen Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: \"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two\u2011thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you.

He spoke against [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policies]] and in support of reducing federal [[budget deficit]]s. But the incumbent was popular and his campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who [[Reagan Democrat|usually voted Democratic]] supported Reagan because they credited him with the economic boom and saw him as strong on [[national security]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the first televised debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president\u201473 at the time\u2014while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\n\nMondale was defeated in a landslide, winning only the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |title=1984 Presidential Election Data\u2014Minnesota |accessdate=April 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010711205902/http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |archivedate=July 11, 2001}}</ref> securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since [[Alf Landon]]'s loss to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]].\n\nMondale received 37,577,352 votes\u201440.6% of the popular vote. He won 40\u201349% in California, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\n===Private citizen and ambassador===\nMondale returned to private law practice with [[Dorsey & Whitney]] in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]]. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study [[campaign finance reform]], and was Clinton's [[Diplomatic rank|special envoy]] to [[Indonesia]] in 1998.\n\nUntil his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues. He also served on nonprofit boards of directors for the [[Guthrie Theater]] Foundation, the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]], the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Diogenes Institute of Higher Learning, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the [[RAND Corporation]], and the University of Minnesota Foundation. His corporate board memberships included BlackRock Advantage Term Trust and other BlackRock Mutual Funds, [[Cargill]] Incorporated, [[CNA Financial]], the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], First Financial Fund, and other Prudential Mutual Funds, [[Northwest Airlines]], and United HealthCare Corporation.\n\nMondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate [[cloture]] rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate.

Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become Vice President in 1977.\n\nDuring his debate with the Republican nominee, former [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]], Mondale emphasized his experience in foreign affairs while painting Coleman as a finger-in-the-wind opportunist. \"We have seen you shift around, Norman\", Mondale said, alluding to Coleman's past as an antiwar college activist and, more recently, as a Democrat who had changed his party allegiance to the GOP while serving as mayor of St. Paul.\n\nMondale lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%), earning him the unique distinction of having lost a statewide general election in all 50 states as the nominee of a major party (he lost the other 49 in the 1984 presidential election and George McGovern had lost 49 states in the 1972 presidential election and lost the Massachusetts primary in 1984).

A [[United States Senator|United States senator]] from [[Minnesota]] (1964\u20131976), he was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Walter Mondale presidential campaign, 1984|nominee]] in the [[United States presidential election of 1984]], but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] [[Landslide victory|landslide]]. Reagan won 49 states while Mondale carried his home state of [[Minnesota]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. In October 2002, Mondale became the last-minute choice of the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] to run for [[2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Senate]] after the death of Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], but was defeated by [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living]] former U.S. vice president after the death of [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2018.\n\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], and graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1951 after attending [[Macalester College]]. He then served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] before earning a [[law degree]] in 1956. He married [[Joan Mondale|Joan Adams]] in 1955. Working as a lawyer in [[Minneapolis]], Mondale was appointed [[Minnesota Attorney General]] in 1960 by Governor [[Orville Freeman]] and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] upon the resignation of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] following Humphrey's election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported [[consumer protection]], [[fair housing]], [[tax reform]], and the [[desegregation]] of schools. Importantly, he served as a member of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (\"[[Church Committee]]\").<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm Staff Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003144646/http://www.fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm |date=October 3, 2009 }} of Church Committee, archived by [[Federation of American Scientists]], Retrieved October 22, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], [[Jimmy Carter]], the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Mondale as his vice-presidential running mate. The Carter\u2013Mondale ticket defeated incumbent president [[Gerald Ford]] and his vice presidential running mate, [[Bob Dole]]. Carter and Mondale's time in office was marred by a worsening economy and they lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 election]] to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a [[nuclear freeze]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], an increase in taxes, and a reduction of [[U.S. public debt]]. His vice presidential nominee was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a Congresswoman from [[New York (state)|New York]], the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush.\n\nAfter his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (1986\u201393). President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Mondale [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] in 1993; he retired in 1996. In [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2002|2002]], Mondale ran for his old Senate seat, agreeing to be the last-minute replacement for Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], who died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. He then returned to working at Dorsey & Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Up Close with Walter Mondale|url=https://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106134345/http://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2015|website=UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA FOUNDATION|publisher=University of Minnesota|access-date=May 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], to Claribel Hope (n\u00e9e Cowan), a part-time music teacher, and Theodore Sigvaard Mondale, a [[Methodist]] minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 |title=American President: Walter Mondale |publisher=Millercenter.org |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704011945/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 |archivedate=July 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389066/Walter-Mondale |title=Walter Mondale|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Walter_Mondale.htm |title=Walter F.

[[NASA]] Administrator [[James E.

In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative.

Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the \"Phillips Report\" existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time.<ref name=\"wamu\"/>\n\nThe controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of three of Mondale's fellow committee members, Republicans [[Margaret Chase Smith]], [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]]) to include the second-guessing of NASA's original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend. The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.\n\nWhile the Committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA's own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967), that \"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident\". Yet Mondale wrote a minority opinion accusing NASA of \"evasiveness,... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy\".<ref name=\"as204_senate\">{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Clinton P.|authorlink=Clinton P.

He became the fourth vice president in four years, after [[Spiro Agnew]] (1969\u201373), [[Gerald Ford]] (1973\u201374), and [[Nelson Rockefeller]] (1974\u201377).\n\nUnder Carter, Mondale traveled extensively throughout the nation and the world advocating the administration's foreign policy. His travels also included a visit to the {{USS|Midway|CV-41}}, which was on station at the time in the Indian Ocean, during the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an \"activist Vice President.\" He began the tradition of weekly lunches with the president, which continues to this day. More importantly, he expanded the vice president's role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration.

W. Bush]]. That year, Mondale opened the [[XIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]].\n\nCarter and Mondale are the longest-living post-presidential team in American history. On May 23, 2006, they had been out of office for 9,254 days (25 years, 4 months and 3 days), surpassing the former record established by President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]], both of whom died on July 4, 1826. On September 8, 2012, Carter surpassed [[Herbert Hoover]] as the president with the longest retirement from office. On April 23, 2014, Mondale surpassed [[Richard Nixon]] as the vice president with the longest retirement from office at 12,146 days (33 years, 3 months and 3 days). With [[George H. W.

His opposition included Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] and Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]]. Hart won the New Hampshire primary in March, but Mondale had much of the party leadership behind him. To great effect, Mondale used the [[Wendy's]] slogan \"[[Where's the beef?]]\" to describe Hart's policies as lacking depth. Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates on the first ballot.\n\n[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Mondale celebrates victories in the 1984 primaries with Carter.]]\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Mexican American, as finalists.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html Trying to Win the Peace], by Even Thomas, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> Others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival [[Gary Hart]]. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being [[pro-choice]]. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first [[Italian American]] to reach that level in American politics.\n\nWhen Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: \"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two\u2011thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you.

He spoke against [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policies]] and in support of reducing federal [[budget deficit]]s. But the incumbent was popular and his campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who [[Reagan Democrat|usually voted Democratic]] supported Reagan because they credited him with the economic boom and saw him as strong on [[national security]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the first televised debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president\u201473 at the time\u2014while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\n\nMondale was defeated in a landslide, winning only the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |title=1984 Presidential Election Data\u2014Minnesota |accessdate=April 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010711205902/http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |archivedate=July 11, 2001}}</ref> securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525.

From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]]. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study [[campaign finance reform]], and was Clinton's [[Diplomatic rank|special envoy]] to [[Indonesia]] in 1998.\n\nUntil his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues. He also served on nonprofit boards of directors for the [[Guthrie Theater]] Foundation, the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]], the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Diogenes Institute of Higher Learning, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the [[RAND Corporation]], and the University of Minnesota Foundation. His corporate board memberships included BlackRock Advantage Term Trust and other BlackRock Mutual Funds, [[Cargill]] Incorporated, [[CNA Financial]], the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], First Financial Fund, and other Prudential Mutual Funds, [[Northwest Airlines]], and United HealthCare Corporation.\n\nMondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate [[cloture]] rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate.

Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become Vice President in 1977.\n\nDuring his debate with the Republican nominee, former [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]], Mondale emphasized his experience in foreign affairs while painting Coleman as a finger-in-the-wind opportunist. \"We have seen you shift around, Norman\", Mondale said, alluding to Coleman's past as an antiwar college activist and, more recently, as a Democrat who had changed his party allegiance to the GOP while serving as mayor of St. Paul.\n\nMondale lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%), earning him the unique distinction of having lost a statewide general election in all 50 states as the nominee of a major party (he lost the other 49 in the 1984 presidential election and George McGovern had lost 49 states in the 1972 presidential election and lost the Massachusetts primary in 1984).

Individual studies give similar results for adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples, community samples, and youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending. This small to moderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal history, which are well-established but very general risk factors. The aspects of core personality often held to be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. For example, Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to crime, including violent crime. In contrast, Factor 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated more strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength to that of the PCL-R as a whole. The antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past criminal behavior, suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor. Thus, the concept of psychopathy may perform poorly when attempted to be used as a general theory of crime.<ref name=\"gap\" /><ref>{{cite journal|first=Glenn D.|last=Walters|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204918|title=The Trouble with Psychopathy as a General Theory of Crime|journal=[[International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=Thousand Oaks, California|volume=48|issue=2|date=April 2004|pages=133\u2013148|doi=10.1177/0306624X03259472|pmid=15070462|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119002546/https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204918 |archive-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Violence====\nStudies have suggested a strong correlation between psychopathy scores and [[violence]], and the PCL-R emphasizes features that are somewhat predictive of violent behavior.

The prevalence of psychopathy among domestic abusers indicate that the core characteristics of psychopathy, such as callousness, remorselessness, and a lack of close interpersonal bonds, predispose those with psychopathy to committing domestic abuse, and suggest that the domestic abuses committed by these individuals are callously perpetrated (i.e. instrumentally aggressive) rather than a case of emotional [[aggression]] and therefore may not be amenable to the types of [[psychosocial]] interventions commonly given to domestic abuse perpetrators.<ref name=\"Walsh2010\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Swogger|first1=Marc T.|last2=Walsh|first2=Zach|last3=Kosson|first3=David S.|title=Domestic violence and psychopathic traits: distinguishing the antisocial batterer from other antisocial offenders|journal=[[Aggressive Behavior (journal)|Aggressive Behavior]]|publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]|location=New York City|date=May 2007|volume=33|issue=3|pages=253\u2013260|doi=10.1002/ab.20185|pmid=17444531}}</ref>\n\nSome clinicians suggest that assessment of the [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to violence [[risk assessment]].

There are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R and some of these are considerably easier, quicker, and less expensive to administer. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as age, gender, number of previous convictions and age of first conviction. Some of these assessments may also identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes that may help short-term management, identify more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk, and may have established specific probabilities of offending for specific scores.

Childhood onset is argued to be more due to a personality disorder caused by neurological deficits interacting with an adverse environment. For many, but not all, childhood onset is associated with what is in [[Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime]] referred to as \"life-course- persistent\" antisocial behavior as well as poorer health and economic status.

Some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adults with psychopathy.

Patients with damage in such areas resembled \"psychopathic individuals\" whose brains were incapable of acquiring social and moral knowledge; those who acquired damage as children may have trouble conceptualizing social or moral reasoning, while those with adult-acquired damage may be aware of proper social and moral conduct but be unable to behave appropriately.

Testosterone is \"associated with approach-related behavior, reward sensitivity, and fear reduction\", and injecting testosterone \"shift[s] the balance from punishment to reward sensitivity\", decreases fearfulness, and increases \"responding to angry faces\". Some studies have found that high testosterone levels are associated with antisocial and aggressive behaviors, yet other research suggests that testosterone alone does not cause aggression but increases dominance-seeking. It is unclear from studies if psychopathy correlates with high testosterone levels, but a few studies have found psychopathy to be linked to low cortisol levels and reactivity. Cortisol increases withdrawal behavior and sensitivity to punishment and aversive conditioning, which are abnormally low in individuals with psychopathy and may underlie their impaired aversion learning and disinhibited behavior. High testosterone levels combined with low serotonin levels are associated with \"impulsive and highly negative reactions\", and may increase violent aggression when an individual is provoked or becomes frustrated.<ref name=Glenn2008>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2008.03.004 |title=The Neurobiology of Psychopathy |year=2008 |last1=Glenn |first1=Andrea L. |last2=Raine |first2=Adrian |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=463\u201375, vii |pmid=18638646}}</ref> Several animal studies note the role of [[serotonin|serotonergic]] functioning in impulsive aggression and antisocial behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0954579409000418 |title=Multifinality in the development of personality disorders: A Biology \u00d7 Sex \u00d7 Environment interaction model of antisocial and borderline traits |year=2009 |last1=Beauchaine |first1=Theodore P. |last2=Klein |first2=Daniel N. |last3=Crowell |first3=Sheila E. |last4=Derbidge |first4=Christina |last5=Gatzke-Kopp |first5=Lisa |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=735\u201370 |pmid=19583882 |pmc=2709751}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0954579405050546 |title=Developmental psychopathology and neurobiology of aggression |year=2005 |last1=Gollan |first1=Jackie K. |last2=Lee |first2=Royce |last3=Coccaro |first3=Emil F. |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=1151\u201371 |pmid=16613435}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Lee R, Coccaro ER |chapter=Neurobiology of impulsive aggression: Focus on serotonin and the orbitofrontal cortex |veditors=Flannery DJ, Vazsonyi AT, Waldman ID |title=The Cambridge handbook of violent behavior and aggression |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |pages=170\u201386 |isbn=978-0-521-60785-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.149 |title=The evidence for a neurobiological model of childhood antisocial behavior |year=2007 |last1=Van Goozen |first1=Stephanie H.

It is a self-report scale that was developed originally for non-clinical samples (e.g. university students) rather than prisoners, though may be used with the latter. It was revised in 2005 to become the PPI-R and now comprises 154 items organized into eight subscales.<ref name=\"ppi-r\">Lilienfeld S. O., Widows M. R. (2005). Psychopathic Personality Inventory\u2014Revised (PPI-R) professional manual. Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.</ref> The item scores have been found to group into two overarching and largely separate factors (unlike the PCL-R factors), Fearless-Dominance and Impulsive Antisociality, plus a third factor, Coldheartedness, which is largely dependent on scores on the other two.<ref name=\"gap\" /> Factor 1 is associated with social efficacy while Factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies. A person may score at different levels on the different factors, but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic personality.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\n====DSM and ICD====\nThere are currently two widely established systems for classifying [[mental disorders]]\u2014the ''[[International Classification of Diseases]]'' (ICD) produced by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) produced by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). Both list categories of disorders thought to be distinct types, and have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe first edition of the DSM in 1952 had a section on sociopathic personality disturbances, then a general term that included such things as homosexuality and alcoholism as well as an \"antisocial reaction\" and \"dyssocial reaction\". The latter two eventually became [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD) in the DSM and [[dissocial personality disorder]] in the ICD.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Both manuals have stated that their diagnoses have been referred to, or include what is referred to, as psychopathy or sociopathy, although neither diagnostic manual has ever included a disorder officially titled as such.<ref name=\"gap\" /><ref name=\"Handbook of Psychopathy\">{{cite book |last=Patrick |first=Christopher |title=Handbook of Psychopathy |year=2005 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-60623-804-2}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"aspd statement\" />\n\n====Other tools====\nThere are some traditional [[personality tests]] that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they assess relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior. These include the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] (Psychopathic Deviate scale), [[California Psychological Inventory]] (Socialization scale), and [[Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory]] Antisocial Personality Disorder scale. There is also the [[Levenson Self-Report Psychopathy Scale]] (LSRP) and the Hare Self-Report Psychopathy Scale (HSRP), but in terms of self-report tests, the PPI/PPI-R has become more used than either of these in modern psychopathy research on adults.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\n===Comorbidity===\nAs with other mental disorders, psychopathy as a personality disorder may be present with a variety of other diagnosable conditions. Studies especially suggest strong comorbidity with [[antisocial personality disorder]]. Among numerous studies, positive correlations have also been reported between psychopathy and [[histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]], [[paranoid personality disorder|paranoid]], and [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] [[personality disorder]]s, [[panic disorder|panic]] and [[obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder|obsessive\u2013compulsive]] disorders, but not [[neurosis|neurotic]] disorders in general, [[schizophrenia]], or [[major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name=\"englandandwales2009\" /><ref name=BlairMitchellBlair>{{cite book |title=Psychopathy, emotion and the brain |last=Blair |first=J |author2=Mitchel D |author3=Blair K |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-631-23336-7 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |pages=25\u20137 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/27005161/The-Psychopath-Emotion-and-the-Brain |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306020403/https://www.scribd.com/doc/27005161/The-Psychopath-Emotion-and-the-Brain |archivedate=2016-03-06 |df= }}</ref><ref name=Nioche>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.encep.2009.07.004 |title=Psychopathie et troubles de la personnalit\u00e9 associ\u00e9s : Recherche d'un effet particulier au trouble borderline ? |trans-title=Psychopathy and associated personality disorders: Searching for a particular effect of the borderline personality disorder? |language=French |year=2010 |last1=Nioche |first1=A. |last2=Pham |first2=T.H. |last3=Ducro |first3=C. |last4=De Beaurepaire |first4=C. |last5=Chudzik |first5=L. |last6=Courtois |first6=R. |last7=R\u00e9veill\u00e8re |first7=C. |journal=L'Enc\u00e9phale |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=253\u20139 |pmid=20620268}}</ref><ref name=Hildebrand>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijlp.2004.03.005 |title=PCL-R psychopathy and its relation to DSM-IV Axis I and II disorders in a sample of male forensic psychiatric patients in the Netherlands |year=2004 |last1=Hildebrand |first1=Martin |last2=De Ruiter |first2=Corine |journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=233\u201348 |pmid=15177992}}</ref><ref name=Nedopil>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-94-011-3965-6_12 |chapter=Comorbidity of Psychopathy with Major Mental Disorders |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqMZzZ7p3jIC&pg=PA257 |title=Psychopathy: Theory, Research and Implications for Society |year=1998 |last1=Nedopil |first1=Norbert |last2=Hollweg |first2=Matthias |last3=Hartmann |first3=Julia |last4=Jaser |first4=Robert |isbn=978-0-7923-4920-4 |pages=257\u201368}}</ref>\n\nAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]) is known to be highly comorbid with [[conduct disorder]] (a theorized precursor to ASPD), and may also co-occur with psychopathic tendencies.

Men score higher than women on both the PCL-R and the PPI and on both of their main scales. The differences tend to be somewhat larger on the interpersonal-affective scale than on the antisocial scale. Most but not all studies have found broadly similar [[Factor analysis|factor structure]] for men and women.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nMany associations with other personality traits are similar, although in one study the antisocial factor was more strongly related with impulsivity in men and more strongly related with [[openness to experience]] in women. It has been suggested that psychopathy in men manifest more as an [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] pattern while in women it manifests more as a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] pattern. Studies on this have shown mixed results. PCL-R scores may be somewhat less predictive of violence and recidivism in women.

Individual studies give similar results for adult offenders, forensic psychiatric samples, community samples, and youth. The PCL-R is poorer at predicting sexual re-offending. This small to moderate effect appears to be due largely to the scale items that assess impulsive behaviors and past criminal history, which are well-established but very general risk factors. The aspects of core personality often held to be distinctively psychopathic generally show little or no predictive link to crime by themselves. For example, Factor 1 of the PCL-R and Fearless dominance of the PPI-R have smaller or no relationship to crime, including violent crime. In contrast, Factor 2 and Impulsive antisociality of the PPI-R are associated more strongly with criminality. Factor 2 has a relationship of similar strength to that of the PCL-R as a whole. The antisocial facet of the PCL-R is still predictive of future violence after controlling for past criminal behavior which, together with results regarding the PPI-R which by design does not include past criminal behavior, suggests that impulsive behaviors is an independent risk factor. Thus, the concept of psychopathy may perform poorly when attempted to be used as a general theory of crime.<ref name=\"gap\" /><ref>{{cite journal|first=Glenn D.|last=Walters|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204918|title=The Trouble with Psychopathy as a General Theory of Crime|journal=[[International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology]]|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=Thousand Oaks, California|volume=48|issue=2|date=April 2004|pages=133\u2013148|doi=10.1177/0306624X03259472|pmid=15070462|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119002546/https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=204918 |archive-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Violence====\nStudies have suggested a strong correlation between psychopathy scores and [[violence]], and the PCL-R emphasizes features that are somewhat predictive of violent behavior.

Furthermore, the commission of domestic violence is correlated with Factor 1 of the [[Psychopathy Checklist|PCL-R]], which describes the emotional deficits and the [[Psychological manipulation|callous and exploitative]] interpersonal style found in psychopathy. The prevalence of psychopathy among domestic abusers indicate that the core characteristics of psychopathy, such as callousness, remorselessness, and a lack of close interpersonal bonds, predispose those with psychopathy to committing domestic abuse, and suggest that the domestic abuses committed by these individuals are callously perpetrated (i.e. instrumentally aggressive) rather than a case of emotional [[aggression]] and therefore may not be amenable to the types of [[psychosocial]] interventions commonly given to domestic abuse perpetrators.<ref name=\"Walsh2010\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Swogger|first1=Marc T.|last2=Walsh|first2=Zach|last3=Kosson|first3=David S.|title=Domestic violence and psychopathic traits: distinguishing the antisocial batterer from other antisocial offenders|journal=[[Aggressive Behavior (journal)|Aggressive Behavior]]|publisher=[[Wiley (publisher)|Wiley]]|location=New York City|date=May 2007|volume=33|issue=3|pages=253\u2013260|doi=10.1002/ab.20185|pmid=17444531}}</ref>\n\nSome clinicians suggest that assessment of the [[Construct (philosophy of science)|construct]] of psychopathy does not necessarily add value to violence [[risk assessment]].

In addition, studies conducted by the authors or translators of violence prediction measures, including the PCL, show on average more positive results than those conducted by more independent investigators. There are several other risk assessment instruments which can predict further crime with an accuracy similar to the PCL-R and some of these are considerably easier, quicker, and less expensive to administer. This may even be done automatically by a computer simply based on data such as age, gender, number of previous convictions and age of first conviction. Some of these assessments may also identify treatment change and goals, identify quick changes that may help short-term management, identify more specific kinds of violence that may be at risk, and may have established specific probabilities of offending for specific scores.

Childhood onset is argued to be more due to a personality disorder caused by neurological deficits interacting with an adverse environment. For many, but not all, childhood onset is associated with what is in [[Terrie Moffitt's developmental theory of crime]] referred to as \"life-course- persistent\" antisocial behavior as well as poorer health and economic status. Adolescent onset is argued to more typically be associated with short-term antisocial behavior.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nIt has been suggested that the combination of early-onset conduct disorder and [[ADHD]] may be associated with life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not a particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have ADHD. Some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adults with psychopathy. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy and increased disinhibition in the triarchic model.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nThe [[DSM-5]] includes a specifier for those with conduct disorder who also display a [[callous and unemotional traits|callous, unemotional interpersonal style]] across multiple settings and relationships.<ref name=\":2\" /> The specifier is based on research which suggests that those with conduct disorder who also meet criteria for the specifier tend to have a more severe form of the disorder with an earlier onset as well as a different response to treatment.

Patients with damage in such areas resembled \"psychopathic individuals\" whose brains were incapable of acquiring social and moral knowledge; those who acquired damage as children may have trouble conceptualizing social or moral reasoning, while those with adult-acquired damage may be aware of proper social and moral conduct but be unable to behave appropriately. Dysfunctions in the amygdala and [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]] may also impair [[reinforcement|stimulus-reinforced learning]] in psychopaths, whether punishment-based or reward-based. People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear to have significantly reduced mean microstructural integrity in their [[uncinate fasciculus]]\u2014[[white matter]] connecting the amygdala and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].

Blair, a researcher who pioneered research into psychopathic tendencies stated, \u201cWith regard to psychopathy, we have clear indications regarding why the pathology gives rise to the emotional and behavioral disturbance and important insights into the neural systems implicated in this pathology\u201d.<ref name=Blair2002 /> Dadds et al., remarks that despite a rapidly advancing neuroscience of empathy, little is known about the developmental underpinnings of the psychopathic disconnect between affective and cognitive empathy.<ref name=\"Dadds et al.\">{{cite journal |title=Learning to 'talk the talk': the relationship of psychopathic traits to deficits in empathy across childhood |year=2010 |last=Dadds |first=Mark|journal=The Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry |volume=50 |pages=599\u2013606 |issue=5 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2008.02058.x|pmid=19445007 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nA 2008 review by Weber et al. suggested that psychopathy is sometimes associated with brain abnormalities in [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal]]-[[temporal lobe|temporo]]-[[limbic system|limbic]] regions that are involved in emotional and learning processes, among others.<ref name=\"review2008\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/bsl.802 |title=Structural brain abnormalities in psychopaths\u2014a review |year=2008 |last1=Weber |first1=Sabrina |last2=Habel |first2=Ute |last3=Amunts |first3=Katrin |last4=Schneider |first4=Frank |journal=Behavioral Sciences & the Law |volume=26 |pages=7\u201328 |pmid=18327824 |issue=1}}</ref> Neuroimaging studies have found structural and functional differences between those scoring high and low on the PCL-R in a 2011 review by Skeem et al. stating that they are \"most notably in the [[amygdala]], [[hippocampus]] and [[parahippocampal gyrus|parahippocampal gyri]], anterior and posterior [[cingulate cortex]], [[striatum]], [[Insular cortex|insula]], and [[frontal lobe|frontal]] and [[temporal lobe|temporal]] [[cerebral cortex|cortex]]\".<ref name=\"gap\" /> A 2010 meta-analysis found that antisocial, violent and psychopathic individuals had reduced structure function in the right [[orbitofrontal cortex]], right [[anterior cingulate cortex]] and left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]].<ref>{{Cite journal |pmc = 2784035|year = 2009|last1 = Yang|first1 = Y.|title = Prefrontal Structural and Functional Brain Imaging findings in Antisocial, Violent, and Psychopathic Individuals: A Meta-Analysis|journal = Psychiatry Research|volume = 174|issue = 2|pages = 81\u201388|last2 = Raine|first2 = A.|pmid = 19833485|doi = 10.1016/j.pscychresns.2009.03.012}}</ref>\n\nThe amygdala and frontal areas have been suggested as particularly important.<ref name=\"pmid18434283\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0027 |title=The amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex: Functional contributions and dysfunction in psychopathy |year=2008 |last1=Blair |first1=R.J.R |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=363 |issue=1503 |pages=2557\u201365 |pmid=18434283 |pmc=2606709}}</ref> People scoring 25 or higher in the PCL-R, with an associated history of violent behavior, appear on average to have significantly reduced microstructural integrity between the [[white matter]] connecting the amygdala and [[orbitofrontal cortex]] (such as the uncinate fasciculus). The evidence suggested that the degree of abnormality was significantly related to the degree of psychopathy and may explain the offending behaviors.<ref name=\"pmid19506560\"/> Furthermore, changes in the amygdala have been associated with \"callous-unemotional\" traits in children. However, the amygdala has also been associated with positive emotions, and there have been inconsistent results in the studies in particular areas, which may be due to methodological issues.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nSome of these findings are consistent with other research and theories. For example, in a [[neuroimaging]] study of how individuals with psychopathy respond to emotional words, widespread differences in activation patterns have been shown across the temporal lobe when psychopathic criminals were compared to \"normal\" volunteers, which is consistent with views in clinical psychology. Additionally, the notion of psychopathy being characterized by low fear is consistent with findings of abnormalities in the amygdala, since deficits in aversive conditioning and instrumental learning are thought to result from amygdala dysfunction, potentially compounded by [[orbitofrontal cortex]] dysfunction, although the specific reasons are unknown.<ref name=Blair2002>{{cite journal |doi=10.1192/bjp.182.1.5 |title=Neurobiological basis of psychopathy |year=2003 |last1=Blair |first1=R.

There is evidence that boldness and disinhibition are genetically distinguishable.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\n===Biochemical===\nHigh levels of [[testosterone]] combined with low levels of [[cortisol]] and/or [[serotonin]] have been theorized as contributing factors. Testosterone is \"associated with approach-related behavior, reward sensitivity, and fear reduction\", and injecting testosterone \"shift[s] the balance from punishment to reward sensitivity\", decreases fearfulness, and increases \"responding to angry faces\". Some studies have found that high testosterone levels are associated with antisocial and aggressive behaviors, yet other research suggests that testosterone alone does not cause aggression but increases dominance-seeking. It is unclear from studies if psychopathy correlates with high testosterone levels, but a few studies have found psychopathy to be linked to low cortisol levels and reactivity. Cortisol increases withdrawal behavior and sensitivity to punishment and aversive conditioning, which are abnormally low in individuals with psychopathy and may underlie their impaired aversion learning and disinhibited behavior. High testosterone levels combined with low serotonin levels are associated with \"impulsive and highly negative reactions\", and may increase violent aggression when an individual is provoked or becomes frustrated.<ref name=Glenn2008>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2008.03.004 |title=The Neurobiology of Psychopathy |year=2008 |last1=Glenn |first1=Andrea L. |last2=Raine |first2=Adrian |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=463\u201375, vii |pmid=18638646}}</ref> Several animal studies note the role of [[serotonin|serotonergic]] functioning in impulsive aggression and antisocial behavior.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0954579409000418 |title=Multifinality in the development of personality disorders: A Biology \u00d7 Sex \u00d7 Environment interaction model of antisocial and borderline traits |year=2009 |last1=Beauchaine |first1=Theodore P. |last2=Klein |first2=Daniel N. |last3=Crowell |first3=Sheila E. |last4=Derbidge |first4=Christina |last5=Gatzke-Kopp |first5=Lisa |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=735\u201370 |pmid=19583882 |pmc=2709751}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0954579405050546 |title=Developmental psychopathology and neurobiology of aggression |year=2005 |last1=Gollan |first1=Jackie K. |last2=Lee |first2=Royce |last3=Coccaro |first3=Emil F. |journal=Development and Psychopathology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=1151\u201371 |pmid=16613435}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Lee R, Coccaro ER |chapter=Neurobiology of impulsive aggression: Focus on serotonin and the orbitofrontal cortex |veditors=Flannery DJ, Vazsonyi AT, Waldman ID |title=The Cambridge handbook of violent behavior and aggression |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2007 |pages=170\u201386 |isbn=978-0-521-60785-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.149 |title=The evidence for a neurobiological model of childhood antisocial behavior |year=2007 |last1=Van Goozen |first1=Stephanie H.

It is a self-report scale that was developed originally for non-clinical samples (e.g. university students) rather than prisoners, though may be used with the latter. It was revised in 2005 to become the PPI-R and now comprises 154 items organized into eight subscales.<ref name=\"ppi-r\">Lilienfeld S. O., Widows M. R. (2005).

Odessa, FL: Psychological Assessment Resources.</ref> The item scores have been found to group into two overarching and largely separate factors (unlike the PCL-R factors), Fearless-Dominance and Impulsive Antisociality, plus a third factor, Coldheartedness, which is largely dependent on scores on the other two.<ref name=\"gap\" /> Factor 1 is associated with social efficacy while Factor 2 is associated with maladaptive tendencies. A person may score at different levels on the different factors, but the overall score indicates the extent of psychopathic personality.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\n====DSM and ICD====\nThere are currently two widely established systems for classifying [[mental disorders]]\u2014the ''[[International Classification of Diseases]]'' (ICD) produced by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) produced by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA). Both list categories of disorders thought to be distinct types, and have deliberately converged their codes in recent revisions so that the manuals are often broadly comparable, although significant differences remain.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe first edition of the DSM in 1952 had a section on sociopathic personality disturbances, then a general term that included such things as homosexuality and alcoholism as well as an \"antisocial reaction\" and \"dyssocial reaction\". The latter two eventually became [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD) in the DSM and [[dissocial personality disorder]] in the ICD.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Both manuals have stated that their diagnoses have been referred to, or include what is referred to, as psychopathy or sociopathy, although neither diagnostic manual has ever included a disorder officially titled as such.<ref name=\"gap\" /><ref name=\"Handbook of Psychopathy\">{{cite book |last=Patrick |first=Christopher |title=Handbook of Psychopathy |year=2005 |publisher=Guilford Press |isbn=978-1-60623-804-2}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"aspd statement\" />\n\n====Other tools====\nThere are some traditional [[personality tests]] that contain subscales relating to psychopathy, though they assess relatively non-specific tendencies towards antisocial or criminal behavior.

Men score higher than women on both the PCL-R and the PPI and on both of their main scales. The differences tend to be somewhat larger on the interpersonal-affective scale than on the antisocial scale. Most but not all studies have found broadly similar [[Factor analysis|factor structure]] for men and women.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nMany associations with other personality traits are similar, although in one study the antisocial factor was more strongly related with impulsivity in men and more strongly related with [[openness to experience]] in women. It has been suggested that psychopathy in men manifest more as an [[Antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] pattern while in women it manifests more as a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]] pattern. Studies on this have shown mixed results. PCL-R scores may be somewhat less predictive of violence and recidivism in women. On the other hand, psychopathy may have a stronger relationship with suicide and possibly internalizing symptoms in women. A suggestion is that psychopathy manifests more as externalizing behaviors in men and more as internalizing behaviors in women.<ref name=\"gap\" />\n\nStudies have also found that women in prison score significantly lower on psychopathy than men, with one study reporting only 11 percent of violent females in prison met the psychopathy criteria in comparison to 31 percent of violent males.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Psychopathy in women: theoretical and clinical perspectives|journal = International Journal of Women's Health|date = 2012-06-01|issn = 1179-1411|pmc = 3379858|pmid = 22723733|pages = 257\u2013263|volume = 4|doi = 10.2147/IJWH.S25518|first = Rolf|last = Wynn|first2 = Marita H|last2 = H\u00f8iseth|first3 = Gunn|last3 = Pettersen}}</ref> Other studies have also pointed out that high psychopathic females are rare in forensic settings.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = [Psychopathic personality in women.
