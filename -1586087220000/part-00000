The transformation from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz takes place abruptly at {{convert|573|C|K F}}. Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume, it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature threshold.\n\nThere are many different varieties of quartz, several of which are semi-precious [[gemstone]]s. Since antiquity, varieties of quartz have been the most commonly used minerals in the making of [[Jewellery|jewelry]] and [[hardstone carving]]s, especially in [[Eurasia]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"quartz\" is derived from the [[German language|German]] word \"Quarz\", which had the same form in the first half of the 14th century in [[Middle High German]] in [[East Central German]]<ref>[https://www.dwds.de/wb/Quarz Digitales W\u00f6rterbuch der deutschen Sprache] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201042329/https://www.dwds.de/wb/Quarz |date=1 December 2017 }} (in German)</ref> and which came from the Polish dialect term ''kwardy'', which corresponds to the Czech term ''tvrd\u00fd'' (\"hard\").<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/quartz |title=Quartz &#124; Definition of quartz by Lexico |access-date=26 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201043652/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/quartz |archive-date=1 December 2017 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] referred to quartz as \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (''krustallos'') derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''\u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03bf\u03c2'' (''kruos'') meaning \"icy cold\", because some [[philosopher]]s (including [[Theophrastus]]) apparently believed the mineral to be a form of [[Supercooling|supercooled]] ice.<ref name=\"Tomkieff\">{{cite journal | url=http://www.minersoc.org/pages/Archive-MM/Volume_26/26-176-172.pdf | title=On the origin of the name 'quartz' | author=Tomkeieff, S.I. | journal=Mineralogical Magazine | year=1942 | volume=26 | issue=176 | pages=172\u2013178 | doi=10.1180/minmag.1942.026.176.04 | access-date=12 August 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904013105/http://www.minersoc.org/pages/Archive-MM/Volume_26/26-176-172.pdf | archive-date=4 September 2015 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all | bibcode=1942MinM...26..172T }}</ref> Today, the term ''rock crystal'' is sometimes used as an alternative name for the purest form of quartz.\n\n==Crystal habit and structure==\n[[File:Quartz crystals on section of limestone core.jpg|thumb|left|Quartz mineral embedded in [[limestone]] (top right of the sample), easily identifiable by its hexagonal form. It cannot be scratched by steel (see [[Mohs scale]]).]]\n\nQuartz belongs to the [[trigonal crystal system]]. The [[crystal habit|ideal crystal shape]] is a six-sided [[prism (geometry)|prism]] terminating with six-sided [[pyramid]]s at each end. In [[nature]] quartz crystals are often [[Crystal twinning|twinned]] (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive. Well-formed crystals typically form in a 'bed' that has unconstrained growth into a void; usually the crystals are attached at the other end to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance within [[gypsum]]. A quartz [[geode]] is such a situation where the void is approximately spherical in shape, lined with a bed of crystals pointing inward.\n\n\u03b1-quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system, [[space group]] ''P''3<sub>1</sub>21 or ''P''3<sub>2</sub>21 depending on the chirality. \u03b2-quartz belongs to the hexagonal system, space group ''P''6<sub>2</sub>22 and ''P''6<sub>4</sub>22, respectively.<ref>Crystal Data, Determinative Tables, ACA Monograph No. 5, American Crystallographic Association, 1963</ref> These space groups are truly chiral (they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs). Both \u03b1-quartz and \u03b2-quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of achiral building blocks (SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra in the present case). The transformation between \u03b1- and \u03b2-quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another, without change in the way they are linked.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:\u0391-Quartz.svg|Crystal structure of \u03b1-quartz (red balls are oxygen, grey are silicon)\nFile:\u0392-Quartz.svg|\u03b2-quartz\n</gallery>\n\n==Varieties (according to microstructure)==\nAlthough many of the varietal names historically arose from the color of the mineral, current scientific naming schemes refer primarily to the microstructure of the mineral.

Natural citrines are rare; most commercial citrines are heat-treated [[amethyst]]s or [[smoky quartz]]es. However, a heat-treated amethyst will have small lines in the crystal, as opposed to a natural citrine's cloudy or smokey appearance. It is nearly impossible to differentiate between cut citrine and yellow [[topaz]] visually, but they differ in [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]]. Brazil is the leading producer of citrine, with much of its production coming from the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The name is derived from the Latin word ''citrina'' which means \"yellow\" and is also the origin of the word \"[[citron]]\". Sometimes citrine and amethyst can be found together in the same crystal, which is then referred to as [[ametrine]].<ref>[http://www.mindat.org/min-1054.html Citrine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502064111/http://www.mindat.org/min-1054.html |date=2 May 2010 }}.

Some rose quartz contains microscopic [[rutile]] needles which produces an [[Asterism (gemology)|asterism]] in transmitted light.

It is very common in [[sedimentary rock]]s such as [[sandstone]] and [[shale]]. It is a common constituent of [[schist]], [[gneiss]], [[quartzite]] and other [[metamorphic rock]]s. Quartz has the lowest potential for [[weathering]] in the [[Goldich dissolution series]] and consequently it is very common as a residual mineral in stream sediments and residual [[soil]]s.\n\nWhile the majority of quartz crystallizes from molten [[magma]], much quartz also chemically precipitates from hot [[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal]] [[Vein (geology)|veins]] as [[gangue]], sometimes with [[ore]] minerals like gold, silver and copper.

Miners only use explosives on rare occasions when they need to expose a deep seam of quartz. The reason for this is that although quartz is known for its hardness, it damages easily if it is suddenly exposed to a change in temperature, such as that caused by a blast. Instead, mining operations use [[Bulldozer|bulldozers]] and [[Backhoe|backhoes]] to remove soil and clay, and expose the quartz crystal veins in the rock. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sciencing.com/quartz-extracted-8700692.html|website=sciencing.com|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==Related silica minerals==\n[[Tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] are high-temperature [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of SiO<sub>2</sub> that occur in high-silica [[Volcano|volcanic]] rocks.

The transformation from \u03b1-quartz to \u03b2-quartz takes place abruptly at {{convert|573|C|K F}}. Since the transformation is accompanied by a significant change in volume, it can easily induce fracturing of ceramics or rocks passing through this temperature threshold.\n\nThere are many different varieties of quartz, several of which are semi-precious [[gemstone]]s.

It cannot be scratched by steel (see [[Mohs scale]]).]]\n\nQuartz belongs to the [[trigonal crystal system]]. The [[crystal habit|ideal crystal shape]] is a six-sided [[prism (geometry)|prism]] terminating with six-sided [[pyramid]]s at each end. In [[nature]] quartz crystals are often [[Crystal twinning|twinned]] (with twin right-handed and left-handed quartz crystals), distorted, or so intergrown with adjacent crystals of quartz or other minerals as to only show part of this shape, or to lack obvious crystal faces altogether and appear massive. Well-formed crystals typically form in a 'bed' that has unconstrained growth into a void; usually the crystals are attached at the other end to a matrix and only one termination pyramid is present. However, doubly terminated crystals do occur where they develop freely without attachment, for instance within [[gypsum]]. A quartz [[geode]] is such a situation where the void is approximately spherical in shape, lined with a bed of crystals pointing inward.\n\n\u03b1-quartz crystallizes in the trigonal crystal system, [[space group]] ''P''3<sub>1</sub>21 or ''P''3<sub>2</sub>21 depending on the chirality. \u03b2-quartz belongs to the hexagonal system, space group ''P''6<sub>2</sub>22 and ''P''6<sub>4</sub>22, respectively.<ref>Crystal Data, Determinative Tables, ACA Monograph No. 5, American Crystallographic Association, 1963</ref> These space groups are truly chiral (they each belong to the 11 enantiomorphous pairs). Both \u03b1-quartz and \u03b2-quartz are examples of chiral crystal structures composed of achiral building blocks (SiO<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra in the present case). The transformation between \u03b1- and \u03b2-quartz only involves a comparatively minor rotation of the tetrahedra with respect to one another, without change in the way they are linked.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:\u0391-Quartz.svg|Crystal structure of \u03b1-quartz (red balls are oxygen, grey are silicon)\nFile:\u0392-Quartz.svg|\u03b2-quartz\n</gallery>\n\n==Varieties (according to microstructure)==\nAlthough many of the varietal names historically arose from the color of the mineral, current scientific naming schemes refer primarily to the microstructure of the mineral.

Natural citrines are rare; most commercial citrines are heat-treated [[amethyst]]s or [[smoky quartz]]es. However, a heat-treated amethyst will have small lines in the crystal, as opposed to a natural citrine's cloudy or smokey appearance. It is nearly impossible to differentiate between cut citrine and yellow [[topaz]] visually, but they differ in [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|hardness]]. Brazil is the leading producer of citrine, with much of its production coming from the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. The name is derived from the Latin word ''citrina'' which means \"yellow\" and is also the origin of the word \"[[citron]]\". Sometimes citrine and amethyst can be found together in the same crystal, which is then referred to as [[ametrine]].<ref>[http://www.mindat.org/min-1054.html Citrine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502064111/http://www.mindat.org/min-1054.html |date=2 May 2010 }}.

Some rose quartz contains microscopic [[rutile]] needles which produces an [[Asterism (gemology)|asterism]] in transmitted light.

Large, flawless, single crystals are synthesized in an [[Autoclave (industrial)|autoclave]] via the [[Hydrothermal synthesis|hydrothermal process]]; [[emerald]]s are also synthesized in this fashion.\n\nLike other crystals, quartz may be [[Metal-coated crystal|coated with metal vapors]] to give it an attractive sheen.\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:ArideGranite1.jpg|thumb| Granite rock in the cliff of Gros la T\u00eate on [[Aride Island]], [[Seychelles]]. The thin (1\u20133 cm wide) brighter layers are quartz veins, formed during the late stages of crystallization of granitic magmas. They are sometimes called \"hydrothermal veins\".]]\nQuartz is a defining constituent of [[granite]] and other [[felsic]] [[igneous rock]]s. It is very common in [[sedimentary rock]]s such as [[sandstone]] and [[shale]]. It is a common constituent of [[schist]], [[gneiss]], [[quartzite]] and other [[metamorphic rock]]s. Quartz has the lowest potential for [[weathering]] in the [[Goldich dissolution series]] and consequently it is very common as a residual mineral in stream sediments and residual [[soil]]s.\n\nWhile the majority of quartz crystallizes from molten [[magma]], much quartz also chemically precipitates from hot [[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal]] [[Vein (geology)|veins]] as [[gangue]], sometimes with [[ore]] minerals like gold, silver and copper. Large crystals of quartz are found in magmatic [[pegmatite]]s. Well-formed crystals may reach several meters in length and [[mass|weigh]] hundreds of kilograms.\n\nNaturally occurring quartz crystals of extremely high purity, necessary for the crucibles and other equipment used for growing [[Monocrystalline silicon|silicon]] [[Wafer (electronics)|wafers]] in the [[semiconductor]] industry, are expensive and rare.

Miners only use explosives on rare occasions when they need to expose a deep seam of quartz.

Instead, mining operations use [[Bulldozer|bulldozers]] and [[Backhoe|backhoes]] to remove soil and clay, and expose the quartz crystal veins in the rock. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sciencing.com/quartz-extracted-8700692.html|website=sciencing.com|access-date=2020-01-28}}</ref>\n\n==Related silica minerals==\n[[Tridymite]] and [[cristobalite]] are high-temperature [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of SiO<sub>2</sub> that occur in high-silica [[Volcano|volcanic]] rocks.
