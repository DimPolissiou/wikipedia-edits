Through this event she was invited to perform on a Dutch TV program. The producer of the program, Gerrit aan't Goor, liked the act so much that he offered to become her manager. Aan't Goor was then the main lyric writer for \u00c5str\u00f6m's compositions up until 2003.

According to critics and fans this album was her best so far. This album also saw the re-claiming of lyric writing for her own compositions. Moreover, this was the first time the artist produced her own album.\n\nThe momentum carried on, and in 2010 ''The Way We Are'' was released \u2013 9 out of 11 of the lyrics on this album are penned by \u00c5str\u00f6m. This album was recorded in [[London]] and produced by Dan Weeks and Matt Weeks. \n\nA new Finnish language album was released in the spring of 2012, under the name ''Avoin taivas''.

In 2019 Nina released a long awaited album in her other native language, Swedish, ''Frid och frimodighet''. The album includes hymns in their Swedish version from ''Rauhaa ja rohkeutta'' and two new Swedish translations of the well-known Finnish songs ''Anna sade, Jumala'' (from the album ''Avoin taivas'') and ''Vain yksin Jeesus''. \nAlso in 2019 Nina released an English compilation album, including new recordings of her \"trademark\" song ''Freedom within prison walls'' and the album title song ''Give me Jesus''. \n\nNina \u00c5str\u00f6m Youtube Channel [[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFk30s3wRY2a-rwYnpv5DVA]] contains her music and regular posts of her video blog both in Finnish and English.\n\nPassing on the experience and skill has become increasingly important to Nina \u00c5str\u00f6m; she teaches seminars and does coaching/mentoring both in Finland and abroad on what it means to be a Christian artist and communicator.\nThe musicians that have been accompanying \u00c5str\u00f6m for many years are Kaarle Mannila (percussions, vocals) and Kimmo Suomela (guitars).

When Nina is not traveling in music or ministry, she is re-charging her batteries at home; often with reading and spending time with family and friends. The sea, open landscapes and beautiful trees are things that easily catch her attention \u2013 even for a longer time.\nLanguage(s) is a passion for \u00c5str\u00f6m \u2013 she is a fluent speaker of Finnish, Swedish and English; in addition to that she speaks a couple of other languages. \n\n[[C.S.

Their contemporary influence has been acknowledged by 1960s musicians such as [[Billy Gibbons]] of [[ZZ Top]], [[Peter Albin]] of [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and Chris Gerniottis of [[Zakary Thaks]].\n\nThe 13th Floor Elevators debut single \"[[You're Gonna Miss Me (song)|You're Gonna Miss Me]]\", a national ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' No.&nbsp;55 hit in 1966, was featured on the 1972 compilation ''[[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968]]''. Seminal [[punk rock]] band [[Television (band)|Television]] played the Elevator's song \"Fire Engine\" live in the mid-1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, the 13th Floor Elevators influenced bands such as [[Primal Scream]], [[the Shamen]], and [[Spacemen 3]], all of whom covered their songs, and [[14 Iced Bears]] who use an [[Jug (instrument)|electric jug]] on their single \"Beautiful Child\". In 2009, [[International Artists]] released a ten CD box set entitled ''Sign of the 3-Eyed Men'', which included the mono and new, alternate stereo mixes of the original albums together with two albums of previously unreleased material and a number of rare live recordings.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nThe 13th Floor Elevators emerged on the local Austin music scene in December 1965,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> where they were contemporary to bands such as the Wig and the Babycakes and later followed by [[Shiva's Headband]] and the Conqueroo. The band formed when Roky Erickson left his group [[the Spades]], and joined up with Stacy Sutherland, Benny Thurman, and John Ike Walton who had been playing Texas coastal towns as the Lingsmen.<ref name=\"Drummond\">{{cite book|last=Drummond|first=Paul|title=Eye Mind: The Saga of Roky Erickson and The 13th Floor Elevators|date=Dec 2007|publisher=Process Media|isbn=978-0-9760822-6-2}}</ref> Tommy Hall was instrumental in bringing the band members together, and joined the group as lyricist and electric jug player.  The band's name developed from a suggestion by drummer John Ike Walton to use the name \"Elevators\". Clementine Hall added \"13th Floor\".<ref name=\"Walton\">{{cite news|first=Margaret|last=Moser|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=John Ike Walton|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A225340|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=August 20, 2004|accessdate=July 30, 2007}}</ref> In addition to an awareness that a number of tall buildings in the US lack a designated [[thirteenth floor|13th floor]], it was noted that the letter \"M\" (for [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]) is the thirteenth letter of the alphabet.<ref name=\"Drummond\"/>\n\n===The first two albums===\nIn early January 1966, producer Gordon Bynum brought the band to Houston to record two songs to release as a single on his newly formed Contact record label. The songs were Erickson's \"You're Gonna Miss Me\", and Hall-Sutherland's \"Tried to Hide\". Some months later, the [[International Artists]] label picked it up and re-released it.\n\nThroughout the spring of 1966, the group toured extensively in Texas, playing clubs in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. They also played on live teen dance shows on TV, such as ''Sumpin Else'', in Dallas, and ''The Larry Kane Show'' in Houston. During the Summer, the IA re-release of \"You're Gonna Miss Me\" became popular outside Texas, especially in Miami, Detroit, and the San Francisco Bay Area.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In October 1966, it peaked on the national ''Billboard'' chart at the No.&nbsp;55 position.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Prompted by the success of the single, the Elevators toured the west coast, made two nationally televised appearances for [[Dick Clark]], and played several dates at the San Francisco ballrooms [[The Fillmore]] and [[The Avalon Ballroom|The Avalon]].\n\nThe International Artists record label in Houston, also home to contemporary Texas underground groups such as [[Red Krayola]] and [[Bubble Puppy]], signed the Elevators to a record contract and released the album ''[[The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators]]'' in November 1966, which became popular among the burgeoning [[counterculture]].<ref name=\"Drummond\"/> Tommy Hall's sleeve-notes for the album, which advocated chemical agents (such as [[LSD]]) as a gateway to a higher, 'non-Aristotelian' state of consciousness, has also contributed to the album's cult status.\n\nDuring their California tour, the band shared bills with [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[The Great Society (band)|the Great Society]] (featuring [[Grace Slick]]), and [[Moby Grape]].<ref name=terrascope>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrascope.co.uk/Features/Powell%20St%20John%20interview.htm|publisher=Terrascope Online|title=Powell St. John|date=2009|accessdate=2017-05-07}}</ref> On returning to Texas in early 1967, they released a second single, \"Levitation\", and continued to play live in Austin, Houston and other Texas cities. In November 1967, the band released a second album, ''[[Easter Everywhere]]''.  The album featured a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]\".<ref name=\"Drummond\"/> However, shortly before work began on ''Easter Everywhere'', Walton and Leatherman left the band and were replaced by Danny Thomas on drums and Dan Galindo on bass,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> because of disputes over mismanagement of the band's career by International Artists and a fundamental disagreement between Walton and Hall over the latter's advocacy of the use of LSD in the pursuit of achieving a higher state of human consciousness.<ref name=\"Walton\"/> As a result, they were not credited in the ''Easter Everywhere'' sleevenotes, despite having appeared on \"(I've Got) Levitation\" and \"She Lives (In a Time of Her Own)\". Despite the lengthy studio work and resources utilized, ''Easter Everywhere'' was not the success the band and International Artists had hoped for. Lacking a hit single and released too late in the year, it sold out its original run, but was never reprinted, suggesting somewhat disappointing sales. Record label paperwork indicate that the band's debut album sold upwards of 40,000 copies during its original run, while ''Easter Everywhere'' may have sold around 10,000 copies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Third album and breakup===\nWhile the band were unable to repeat their national success, they were still a powerful presence on the Texas rock music scene. Chris Gerniottis, ex-lead singer of [[Zakary Thaks]] has spoken repeatedly of how the Elevators stood apart from all the other bands on the regional scene, and they continued to influence these bands during the late 1960s. Following the local popularity of the track \"Slip Inside This House\", an edited version was released as a single in early 1968 and was played frequently on Houston radio.\n\nMeanwhile, the Elevators had lost their bass player Dan Galindo, who went on to another International Artists band, the Rubiayat. Duke Davis briefly replaced Galindo, before the band's earlier bassist Ronnie Leatherman returned in the Summer of 1968. As documented in a lengthy interview and article in the Texas underground music magazine ''Mother'' No.&nbsp;3, the band worked all Spring of 1968 on their new album, which at one point was to be called ''Beauty and the Beast''. However, because of an unstable member line-up and the increasingly erratic behavior of the psychedelicized Tommy Hall and mentally fragile Roky Erickson, little of value came out of these sessions. The live shows had lost their original energy, and often the band would perform without their lead singer Erickson, due to his recurring hospital treatments at the time. The last concert featuring the \"real\" Elevators occurred in April 1968.\n\nInternational Artists put out a ''Live'' LP in August 1968, which was composed of old demo tapes and outtakes dating back to 1966 for the most part, with fake applause and audience noise added.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Around this time, the original 13th Floor Elevators disbanded, as the nucleus of Erickson-Hall-Sutherland had been reduced to guitarist Stacy Sutherland only. Sutherland brought some of his own songs for a final set of studio sessions, which led to the dark, intense posthumous album ''Bull of the Woods''. Initially disliked by many Elevators fans, it has found a substantial fan-base today, with some even rating it the band's best LP.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} These final sessions consisted of Sutherland on guitar, Ronnie Leatherman on bass, and Danny Thomas on drums. A few live gigs were played around Texas during the second half of 1968, until an article in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in December 1968 declared the band gone. International Artists pulled together the various studio recordings from 1968 and, with the assistance of drummer Danny Thomas, added some horn arrangements, which became the ''Bull of the Woods'' album, released in March 1969.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The final 13th Floor Elevators record released by International Artists was a reissue of the \"You're Gonna Miss Me\" single in mid-1969.\n\nSinger [[Janis Joplin]] was a close associate of Clementine Hall and the band. She opened for the band at a benefit concert in Austin, and considered joining the group<ref name=\"Vorda\">{{cite book|last=Vorda|first=Allen|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Psychedelic Psounds: Interviews from A to Z with 60s Psychedelic and Garage Bands|year=1994|publisher=Borderline Productions|location=|isbn=0-9512875-9-1}}</ref> prior to heading to San Francisco and joining [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]].\n\nDrug overuse and related legal problems left the band in a state of constant turmoil, which took its toll, both physically and mentally, on the members.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In 1969, facing a felony marijuana possession charge, Roky Erickson chose to be admitted to a [[psychiatric hospital]] rather than serve a prison term, thus signaling the end of the band's career.<ref name=\"Drummond\"/>\n\n''Bull of the Woods'', released in 1969, was the 13th Floor Elevators' last released album on which they worked as a group, and was largely the work of Stacy Sutherland. Erickson, due to health and legal problems, and Tommy Hall were only involved with a few tracks, including \"Livin' On\", \"Never Another\", \"Dear Doctor Doom\", and \"May the Circle Remain Unbroken\".\n\n==Music==\nDuring the initial months of their existence as a band, the electric guitars used both by Roky Erickson and Stacy Sutherland were [[Gibson ES-330]]s. Sutherland's pioneering use of [[reverberation|reverb]] and echo, and [[blues]]y, [[acid rock|acid]]-drenched guitar predates such bands as [[ZZ Top]], [[Butthole Surfers]], and [[The Black Angels (band)|the Black Angels]]. According to [[Billy Gibbons]] of ZZ Top, in the documentary ''[[You're Gonna Miss Me]]'', the guitars were run through [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Fender Twin#Blackface|Blackface Twin Reverbs]], [[Fender Reverb Unit]]s (referred to as a \"tube reverb\" or \"reverb tank\"), and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.premierguitar.com/november-2016-01|title=Cover|website=Digital.premierguitar.com|date=November 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA special aspect of the Elevators' sound came from Tommy Hall's innovative electric jug. The jug, a crock-jug with a microphone held up to it while it was being blown, sounded somewhat like a cross between a [[minimoog]] and [[cuica]] drum.  In contrast to traditional musical jug technique, Hall did not blow into the jug to produce a tuba-like sound.  Instead, he vocalized musical runs into the mouth of the jug, using the jug to create echo and distortion of his voice.  When playing live, he held the microphone up to the mouth of the jug, but when recording the ''Easter Everywhere'' album, the recording engineer placed a microphone inside the jug to enhance the sound.\n\nAt Tommy Hall's urging, the band often played their live shows and recorded their albums while under the influence of [[LSD]], and built their lifestyle and music around the psychedelic experience.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Intellectual and esoteric influences helped shape their work, which shows traces of [[Gurdjieff]], the [[General Semantics]] of Alfred Korzybski, the psychedelic philosophy of [[Timothy Leary]], and Tantric meditation.\n\n==Members==\nThe original 13th Floor Elevators line-up was built around singer/guitarist [[Roky Erickson]], electric [[Jug (musical instrument)|jug]] player Tommy Hall, and guitarist Stacy Sutherland. The rhythm section went through several changes, with drummer John Ike Walton and bass player Ronnie Leatherman being replaced in July 1967. Walton and Leatherman left the band; in their stead were new recruits Danny Thomas (drums, piano) and Dan Galindo (bass) which completed the classic Elevators line-up. Hall remained the band's primary lyricist and philosopher, with Sutherland and Erickson both contributing lyrics as well as writing music, and, later, working with Danny Thomas to arrange the group's more challenging music. In addition to Erickson's powerful vocals, Hall's \"electric jug\" became the band's signature sound.  Later, Ronnie Leatherman returned for the third and final studio album, ''Bull of the Woods'' along with Thomas, and Sutherland.\n\n*[[Roky Erickson]] \u2013 guitar, lead vocals, songwriter (1965-1968, 1984, 2015) (died 2019)\n*Tommy Hall \u2013 electric [[jug (musical instrument)|jug]], vocals, songwriter (1965-1968, 2015)\n*Stacy Sutherland \u2013 lead guitar, vocals, songwriter (1965-1969) (died 1978)\n\n*John Ike Walton \u2013 drums (1965-1967, 1984, 2015)\n*Benny Thurman \u2013 bass, vocals (1965-1966)\n*Ronnie Leatherman \u2013 bass, vocals (1965-1966, 1967, 1968, 1984, 2015)\n*Danny Galindo \u2013 bass (1966-1968)\n*[[Danny Thomas (musician)|Danny Thomas]] \u2013 drums, vocals, arrangements (1967-1969)\n*Duke Davis \u2013 bass (1968)\n*Fred Mitchim - guitar, vocals (2015)\n*Eli Southard - guitar (2015)\n\nOther collaborators and contributors\n* [[Powell St. John]] \u2013 member of [[Mother Earth (American band)|Mother Earth]], songwriter (\"Slide Machine\", \"You Don't Know\", \"Monkey Island\", \"Take That Girl\", \"Kingdom of Heaven\", \"Right Track Now\")\n* Clementine Hall \u2013 wife of Tommy Hall, vocals and songwriting collaborations with Erickson (\"Splash 1\" and \"I Had to Tell You\")\n\n===Timeline===\n<div align=\"left\">\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:750 height:300\nPlotArea = left:100 bottom:80 top:10 right:10\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat  = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1965 till:01/03/1969\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\n\nColors =\n  id:vocals   value:red        legend:Vocals\n  id:bvocals  value:pink          legend:Backing_vocals\n  id:jug      value:gray(0.5)    legend:Jug\n  id:lguitar  value:teal  legend:Lead_guitar\n  id:rguitar  value:brightgreen    legend:Rhythm_guitar\n  id:bass     value:blue     legend:Bass\n  id:drums    value:orange       legend:Drums\n  id:lines1   value:black      legend:Studio_album\n  id:bars    value:gray(0.95)\n\nBackgroundColors = bars:bars\n\nLegend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:1\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:1965\n\nBarData =\n  bar:Roky   text:Roky Erickson\n  bar:Tommy  text:Tommy Hall\n  bar:Stacy  text:Stacy Sutherland\n  bar:Benny  text:Benny Thurman\n  bar:Ronnie text:Ronnie Leatherman\n  bar:DannyG text:Danny Galindo\n  bar:Duke   text:Duke Davis\n  bar:John   text:John Ike Walton\n  bar:Danny  text:Danny Thomas\n\nPlotData=\n  width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\n\n  bar:Roky from:01/01/1965 till:end color:Vocals\n  bar:Roky from:01/01/1965 till:end color:rguitar width:3\n  bar:Stacy from:01/01/1965 till:01/01/1968 color:lguitar\n  bar:Stacy from:01/01/1965 till:01/01/1968 color:bvocals width:3\n  bar:Stacy from:01/01/1968 till:end color:vocals\n  bar:Stacy from:01/01/1968 till:end color:lguitar width:3\n  bar:Tommy from:01/01/1965 till:end color:jug\n  bar:Tommy from:01/01/1965 till:end color:bvocals width:3\n  bar:John  from:01/01/1965 till:01/09/1967 color:drums\n  bar:Danny from:01/09/1967 till:end color:drums\n  bar:Danny from:01/09/1967 till:end color:bvocals width:3\n  bar:Benny from:01/01/1965 till:01/06/1966 color:bass\n  bar:Benny from:01/01/1965 till:01/06/1966 color:bvocals width:3\n  bar:Ronnie from:01/06/1966 till:01/09/1967 color:bass\n  bar:Ronnie from:01/06/1966 till:01/09/1967 color:bvocals width:3\n  bar:DannyG from:01/09/1967 till:01/01/1968 color:bass\n  bar:Duke  from:01/01/1968 till:01/06/1968 color:bass\n  bar:Ronnie from:01/06/1968 till:end color:bass\n  bar:Ronnie from:01/06/1968 till:end color:bvocals width:3\n\nLineData=\n at:01/10/1966 color:lines1 layer:back\n at:01/11/1967 color:lines1 layer:back\n at:01/03/1969 color:lines1 layer:back\n\n</timeline>\n</div>\n\n==Post-Elevators careers and reunions==\nAfter pleading insanity in response to drugs charges\u2014he was arrested for possession of a single marijuana joint\u2014Roky Erickson was committed to a mental hospital in 1969. Jason Ankeny of [[AllMusic]] has written that the treatments Erickson received during his three-and-a-half-year confinement may have contributed to his subsequent mental troubles. At that point the Elevators had already dissolved, although local promoters, along with their record label, International Artists, made some attempts to keep the band's name alive. Erickson attempted a sporadic solo career, burdened by management who exploited his instability and involved him in contracts that left him no control or profit from his music. After staying mostly out of sight in the 1980s, Erickson gradually returned to music in the 1990s, especially when the tribute album ''[[Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye: A Tribute to Roky Erickson|Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye]]''\u2014featuring players from [[ZZ Top]], [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]], and [[R.E.M.]], all of whom claimed Erickson's or the Elevators' influence\u2014was released. He recorded ''All That May Do My Rhyme'' for the Trance Syndicate label, owned by the [[Butthole Surfers]]'s King Coffey, who claimed Erickson told him it was the first time he'd ever been given a royalty check for his music. By 2001, Erickson's brother Sumner had been awarded custody of the troubled musician and helped him receive better psychological treatment, restore his physical health, and connect with a legal team that helped him untangle his complicated past contracts and begin receiving more royalties for his music.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} ''I Have Always Been Here Before'', a 43-track compilation of his post-Elevators music, was released in 2005, and Erickson receives full royalties for the set. In 2010, he released ''[[True Love Cast Out All Evil]]'', a full-length collaboration with indie rock band [[Okkervil River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Roky-Erickson-With-Okkervil-River-True-Love-Cast-Out-All-Evil/master/241843|title=discogs.com: True Love Cast Out All Evil by Roky Erickson and Okkervil River|website=Discogs.com|date=|accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n\nStacy Sutherland formed his own band, [[Ice (U.S. band)|Ice]], which performed only in Houston and never released any material. In 1969, after a battle with heroin addiction, he was imprisoned in Texas on drug charges, the culmination of several years of drug-related trouble with the law. After his release Sutherland began to drink heavily. He continued to sporadically play music throughout the 1970s, occasionally with former members of the Elevators. Sutherland was accidentally shot and killed by his wife Bunny on August 24, 1978 during a domestic dispute,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> and is buried in [[Center Point, Kerr County, Texas]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A225343|title=Music: High Baptismal Flow: Part 2: The 13th Floor Elevators' ground floors: Where are they now?|newspaper=The Austin Chronicle|accessdate=2011-11-02}}</ref>\n\nDanny Galindo played bass with [[Jimmie Vaughan]]'s (Stevie Ray's older brother) band Storm in Austin, Texas, during the 1970s.

After leaving Texas and returning to North Carolina, he played from 1970 to 1997 with: Lou Curry Band, Dogmeat, [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith]], and Bessie Mae's Dream. During this time, he owned his own delivery company called Gophers, Inc. Prior to that he worked in accounting at [[Carolinas Medical Center]] (formerly Charlotte Memorial Hospital).

Their contemporary influence has been acknowledged by 1960s musicians such as [[Billy Gibbons]] of [[ZZ Top]], [[Peter Albin]] of [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and Chris Gerniottis of [[Zakary Thaks]].\n\nThe 13th Floor Elevators debut single \"[[You're Gonna Miss Me (song)|You're Gonna Miss Me]]\", a national ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' No.&nbsp;55 hit in 1966, was featured on the 1972 compilation ''[[Nuggets: Original Artyfacts from the First Psychedelic Era, 1965-1968]]''. Seminal [[punk rock]] band [[Television (band)|Television]] played the Elevator's song \"Fire Engine\" live in the mid-1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, the 13th Floor Elevators influenced bands such as [[Primal Scream]], [[the Shamen]], and [[Spacemen 3]], all of whom covered their songs, and [[14 Iced Bears]] who use an [[Jug (instrument)|electric jug]] on their single \"Beautiful Child\". In 2009, [[International Artists]] released a ten CD box set entitled ''Sign of the 3-Eyed Men'', which included the mono and new, alternate stereo mixes of the original albums together with two albums of previously unreleased material and a number of rare live recordings.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nThe 13th Floor Elevators emerged on the local Austin music scene in December 1965,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> where they were contemporary to bands such as the Wig and the Babycakes and later followed by [[Shiva's Headband]] and the Conqueroo. The band formed when Roky Erickson left his group [[the Spades]], and joined up with Stacy Sutherland, Benny Thurman, and John Ike Walton who had been playing Texas coastal towns as the Lingsmen.<ref name=\"Drummond\">{{cite book|last=Drummond|first=Paul|title=Eye Mind: The Saga of Roky Erickson and The 13th Floor Elevators|date=Dec 2007|publisher=Process Media|isbn=978-0-9760822-6-2}}</ref> Tommy Hall was instrumental in bringing the band members together, and joined the group as lyricist and electric jug player.  The band's name developed from a suggestion by drummer John Ike Walton to use the name \"Elevators\". Clementine Hall added \"13th Floor\".<ref name=\"Walton\">{{cite news|first=Margaret|last=Moser|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=John Ike Walton|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A225340|work=[[The Austin Chronicle]]|date=August 20, 2004|accessdate=July 30, 2007}}</ref> In addition to an awareness that a number of tall buildings in the US lack a designated [[thirteenth floor|13th floor]], it was noted that the letter \"M\" (for [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]) is the thirteenth letter of the alphabet.<ref name=\"Drummond\"/>\n\n===The first two albums===\nIn early January 1966, producer Gordon Bynum brought the band to Houston to record two songs to release as a single on his newly formed Contact record label. The songs were Erickson's \"You're Gonna Miss Me\", and Hall-Sutherland's \"Tried to Hide\". Some months later, the [[International Artists]] label picked it up and re-released it.\n\nThroughout the spring of 1966, the group toured extensively in Texas, playing clubs in Austin, Dallas, and Houston. They also played on live teen dance shows on TV, such as ''Sumpin Else'', in Dallas, and ''The Larry Kane Show'' in Houston. During the Summer, the IA re-release of \"You're Gonna Miss Me\" became popular outside Texas, especially in Miami, Detroit, and the San Francisco Bay Area.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In October 1966, it peaked on the national ''Billboard'' chart at the No.&nbsp;55 position.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Prompted by the success of the single, the Elevators toured the west coast, made two nationally televised appearances for [[Dick Clark]], and played several dates at the San Francisco ballrooms [[The Fillmore]] and [[The Avalon Ballroom|The Avalon]].\n\nThe International Artists record label in Houston, also home to contemporary Texas underground groups such as [[Red Krayola]] and [[Bubble Puppy]], signed the Elevators to a record contract and released the album ''[[The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators]]'' in November 1966, which became popular among the burgeoning [[counterculture]].<ref name=\"Drummond\"/> Tommy Hall's sleeve-notes for the album, which advocated chemical agents (such as [[LSD]]) as a gateway to a higher, 'non-Aristotelian' state of consciousness, has also contributed to the album's cult status.\n\nDuring their California tour, the band shared bills with [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[The Great Society (band)|the Great Society]] (featuring [[Grace Slick]]), and [[Moby Grape]].<ref name=terrascope>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrascope.co.uk/Features/Powell%20St%20John%20interview.htm|publisher=Terrascope Online|title=Powell St. John|date=2009|accessdate=2017-05-07}}</ref> On returning to Texas in early 1967, they released a second single, \"Levitation\", and continued to play live in Austin, Houston and other Texas cities. In November 1967, the band released a second album, ''[[Easter Everywhere]]''.  The album featured a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]\".<ref name=\"Drummond\"/> However, shortly before work began on ''Easter Everywhere'', Walton and Leatherman left the band and were replaced by Danny Thomas on drums and Dan Galindo on bass,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> because of disputes over mismanagement of the band's career by International Artists and a fundamental disagreement between Walton and Hall over the latter's advocacy of the use of LSD in the pursuit of achieving a higher state of human consciousness.<ref name=\"Walton\"/> As a result, they were not credited in the ''Easter Everywhere'' sleevenotes, despite having appeared on \"(I've Got) Levitation\" and \"She Lives (In a Time of Her Own)\". Despite the lengthy studio work and resources utilized, ''Easter Everywhere'' was not the success the band and International Artists had hoped for. Lacking a hit single and released too late in the year, it sold out its original run, but was never reprinted, suggesting somewhat disappointing sales. Record label paperwork indicate that the band's debut album sold upwards of 40,000 copies during its original run, while ''Easter Everywhere'' may have sold around 10,000 copies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n===Third album and breakup===\nWhile the band were unable to repeat their national success, they were still a powerful presence on the Texas rock music scene. Chris Gerniottis, ex-lead singer of [[Zakary Thaks]] has spoken repeatedly of how the Elevators stood apart from all the other bands on the regional scene, and they continued to influence these bands during the late 1960s. Following the local popularity of the track \"Slip Inside This House\", an edited version was released as a single in early 1968 and was played frequently on Houston radio.\n\nMeanwhile, the Elevators had lost their bass player Dan Galindo, who went on to another International Artists band, the Rubiayat. Duke Davis briefly replaced Galindo, before the band's earlier bassist Ronnie Leatherman returned in the Summer of 1968. As documented in a lengthy interview and article in the Texas underground music magazine ''Mother'' No.&nbsp;3, the band worked all Spring of 1968 on their new album, which at one point was to be called ''Beauty and the Beast''. However, because of an unstable member line-up and the increasingly erratic behavior of the psychedelicized Tommy Hall and mentally fragile Roky Erickson, little of value came out of these sessions. The live shows had lost their original energy, and often the band would perform without their lead singer Erickson, due to his recurring hospital treatments at the time. The last concert featuring the \"real\" Elevators occurred in April 1968.\n\nInternational Artists put out a ''Live'' LP in August 1968, which was composed of old demo tapes and outtakes dating back to 1966 for the most part, with fake applause and audience noise added.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Around this time, the original 13th Floor Elevators disbanded, as the nucleus of Erickson-Hall-Sutherland had been reduced to guitarist Stacy Sutherland only. Sutherland brought some of his own songs for a final set of studio sessions, which led to the dark, intense posthumous album ''Bull of the Woods''. Initially disliked by many Elevators fans, it has found a substantial fan-base today, with some even rating it the band's best LP.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} These final sessions consisted of Sutherland on guitar, Ronnie Leatherman on bass, and Danny Thomas on drums. A few live gigs were played around Texas during the second half of 1968, until an article in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in December 1968 declared the band gone. International Artists pulled together the various studio recordings from 1968 and, with the assistance of drummer Danny Thomas, added some horn arrangements, which became the ''Bull of the Woods'' album, released in March 1969.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The final 13th Floor Elevators record released by International Artists was a reissue of the \"You're Gonna Miss Me\" single in mid-1969.\n\nSinger [[Janis Joplin]] was a close associate of Clementine Hall and the band. She opened for the band at a benefit concert in Austin, and considered joining the group<ref name=\"Vorda\">{{cite book|last=Vorda|first=Allen|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Psychedelic Psounds: Interviews from A to Z with 60s Psychedelic and Garage Bands|year=1994|publisher=Borderline Productions|location=|isbn=0-9512875-9-1}}</ref> prior to heading to San Francisco and joining [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]].\n\nDrug overuse and related legal problems left the band in a state of constant turmoil, which took its toll, both physically and mentally, on the members.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In 1969, facing a felony marijuana possession charge, Roky Erickson chose to be admitted to a [[psychiatric hospital]] rather than serve a prison term, thus signaling the end of the band's career.<ref name=\"Drummond\"/>\n\n''Bull of the Woods'', released in 1969, was the 13th Floor Elevators' last released album on which they worked as a group, and was largely the work of Stacy Sutherland. Erickson, due to health and legal problems, and Tommy Hall were only involved with a few tracks, including \"Livin' On\", \"Never Another\", \"Dear Doctor Doom\", and \"May the Circle Remain Unbroken\".\n\n==Music==\nDuring the initial months of their existence as a band, the electric guitars used both by Roky Erickson and Stacy Sutherland were [[Gibson ES-330]]s. Sutherland's pioneering use of [[reverberation|reverb]] and echo, and [[blues]]y, [[acid rock|acid]]-drenched guitar predates such bands as [[ZZ Top]], [[Butthole Surfers]], and [[The Black Angels (band)|the Black Angels]]. According to [[Billy Gibbons]] of ZZ Top, in the documentary ''[[You're Gonna Miss Me]]'', the guitars were run through [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] [[Fender Twin#Blackface|Blackface Twin Reverbs]], [[Fender Reverb Unit]]s (referred to as a \"tube reverb\" or \"reverb tank\"), and [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] [[Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digital.premierguitar.com/november-2016-01|title=Cover|website=Digital.premierguitar.com|date=November 2016|accessdate=June 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\nA special aspect of the Elevators' sound came from Tommy Hall's innovative electric jug. The jug, a crock-jug with a microphone held up to it while it was being blown, sounded somewhat like a cross between a [[minimoog]] and [[cuica]] drum.  In contrast to traditional musical jug technique, Hall did not blow into the jug to produce a tuba-like sound.  Instead, he vocalized musical runs into the mouth of the jug, using the jug to create echo and distortion of his voice.  When playing live, he held the microphone up to the mouth of the jug, but when recording the ''Easter Everywhere'' album, the recording engineer placed a microphone inside the jug to enhance the sound.\n\nAt Tommy Hall's urging, the band often played their live shows and recorded their albums while under the influence of [[LSD]], and built their lifestyle and music around the psychedelic experience.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Intellectual and esoteric influences helped shape their work, which shows traces of [[Gurdjieff]], the [[General Semantics]] of Alfred Korzybski, the psychedelic philosophy of [[Timothy Leary]], and Tantric meditation.\n\n==Members==\nThe original 13th Floor Elevators line-up was built around singer/guitarist [[Roky Erickson]], electric [[Jug (musical instrument)|jug]] player Tommy Hall, and guitarist Stacy Sutherland. The rhythm section went through several changes, with drummer John Ike Walton and bass player Ronnie Leatherman being replaced in July 1967. Walton and Leatherman left the band; in their stead were new recruits Danny Thomas (drums, piano) and Dan Galindo (bass) which completed the classic Elevators line-up.

Jason Ankeny of [[AllMusic]] has written that the treatments Erickson received during his three-and-a-half-year confinement may have contributed to his subsequent mental troubles. At that point the Elevators had already dissolved, although local promoters, along with their record label, International Artists, made some attempts to keep the band's name alive. Erickson attempted a sporadic solo career, burdened by management who exploited his instability and involved him in contracts that left him no control or profit from his music. After staying mostly out of sight in the 1980s, Erickson gradually returned to music in the 1990s, especially when the tribute album ''[[Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye: A Tribute to Roky Erickson|Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye]]''\u2014featuring players from [[ZZ Top]], [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]], and [[R.E.M.]], all of whom claimed Erickson's or the Elevators' influence\u2014was released. He recorded ''All That May Do My Rhyme'' for the Trance Syndicate label, owned by the [[Butthole Surfers]]'s King Coffey, who claimed Erickson told him it was the first time he'd ever been given a royalty check for his music. By 2001, Erickson's brother Sumner had been awarded custody of the troubled musician and helped him receive better psychological treatment, restore his physical health, and connect with a legal team that helped him untangle his complicated past contracts and begin receiving more royalties for his music.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} ''I Have Always Been Here Before'', a 43-track compilation of his post-Elevators music, was released in 2005, and Erickson receives full royalties for the set.

Once the bones have been bleached by the sun and wind, which can take as long as a year, they are collected in an [[ossuary]] pit at the centre of the tower, where \u2013 assisted by [[Limestone|lime]] \u2013 they gradually disintegrate, and the remaining material \u2013 with run-off rainwater \u2013 runs through multiple coal and sand filters before being eventually washed out to sea.

The building is no longer in use.]]\n[[File:Doodentoren van de Zoroastri\u00ebrs.jpg|thumb|An early 20th century photograph of an Iranian tower of silence.]]\n\nIn the Iranian Zoroastrian tradition, the towers were built atop hills or low mountains in desert locations distant from population centers. In the early twentieth century, the Iranian Zoroastrians gradually discontinued their use and began to favour burial or [[cremation]].\n\nThe decision to change the system was accelerated by three considerations: the first problem arose with the establishment of the [[Dar ul-Funun (Persia)|Dar ul-Funun]] medical school. Since Islam considers unnecessary dissection of corpses as a form of mutilation, thus forbidding it, there were no corpses for study available through official channels. The towers were repeatedly broken into, much to the dismay of the Zoroastrian community. Secondly, while the towers had been built away from population centers, the growth of the towns led to the towers now being within city limits. Finally, many of the Zoroastrians found the system outdated. Following long negotiations between the ''anjuman'' societies of [[Yazd]], [[Kerman]], and [[Tehran]], the latter gained a majority and established a cemetery some 10&nbsp;km from Tehran at Ghassr-e Firouzeh (Firouzeh's Palace). The graves were lined with rocks and plastered with cement to prevent direct contact with the earth. In Yazd and Kerman, in addition to cemeteries, orthodox Zoroastrians continued to maintain a tower until the 1970s when ritual exposure was prohibited by law.\n\n===In India===\n[[File:BombayTempleOfSilenceEngraving.jpg|thumb|A late-19th-century engraving of a Zoroastrian Tower of Silence in [[Mumbai]].]]\nFollowing the rapid expansion of the Indian cities, the squat buildings are today in or near population centers, but separated from the metropolitan bustle by gardens or forests.

The practice is deeply rooted in religion, and is considered the first type of street performance in Ukraine .\n\nThe Vertep lost popularity<ref>[http://www.russia-ic.com/culture_art/traditions/628/#.UcBzfec9GSr Russian IC.

However, in recent times, it was revived and reformatted into a drama play. Every year, actors stage a live re-enactment of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]].\n\n==Customs and Practices==\n\nThe Vertep takes its inspiration from Chapter 2 of the Book of Matthew found in the [[New Testament]]. It highlights the Nativity scene and how [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] found out the messiah had finally been born and how he sent his soldiers to kill all the infants in Judea.\n\nEach variation of the play contains around 10 to 40 characters. It includes King Herod, Mary, Joseph, a choir of angels, a group of shepherds, flocks of animals, the Three Kings, and several Polish and Jewish individuals.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/guide/about-kyiv/without-zhyd-vertep-tells-story-of-jesus-christs-b-119505.html Zhuk, Alyona.

It was primarily a puppet show practiced and developed by the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. The practice is deeply rooted in religion, and is considered the first type of street performance in Ukraine .\n\nThe Vertep lost popularity<ref>[http://www.russia-ic.com/culture_art/traditions/628/#.UcBzfec9GSr Russian IC. Petrushka and Vertep: On Traditions of Russian Puppet Theater.] Retrieved 1 July 2013</ref> after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], particularly during the 1920s and 1930s . However, in recent times, it was revived and reformatted into a drama play. Every year, actors stage a live re-enactment of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]].\n\n==Customs and Practices==\n\nThe Vertep takes its inspiration from Chapter 2 of the Book of Matthew found in the [[New Testament]]. It highlights the Nativity scene and how [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] found out the messiah had finally been born and how he sent his soldiers to kill all the infants in Judea.\n\nEach variation of the play contains around 10 to 40 characters. It includes King Herod, Mary, Joseph, a choir of angels, a group of shepherds, flocks of animals, the Three Kings, and several Polish and Jewish individuals.<ref>[http://www.kyivpost.com/guide/about-kyiv/without-zhyd-vertep-tells-story-of-jesus-christs-b-119505.html Zhuk, Alyona.

Song and dance numbers are performed. Current events are also incorporated into the story structure of the play to add relevance to a modern audience.

One had an [[azimuth]] of 196\u00b0 (south west) and the other 260\u00b0 (facing west).<ref name=\"Podvig-History\" /> The radar had a range of {{convert|3000|km|mi|0}}.<ref name=\"RTI-Radar\" />\n\nThe radar started to be built in the early 1970s. Some sources say that it started operating in 1977,<ref name=\"nk-sprn\"/> others say it became operational on 16 January 1979.<ref name=\"Podvig-History\" /><ref name=\"Kommersant2008\"/>\n\nA second generation radar, a [[Daryal radar|Daryal]]-UM, was started at a different location outside of Mukacheve, {{convert|6.7|km}} away, north of the village of Pistryalovo. It was planned that this would replace the Dnepr but construction stopped in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, and never restarted.<ref name=\"Podvig-History\" /> The Daryal has separate receiver and transmitter buildings, at Mukachevo they are {{convert|630|m}} apart. The transmitter building is ruined, was being demolished in autumn 2011, and is at {{coord|48|23|6.56|N|22|48|1.72|E|name=Mukachevo Daryal radar transmitter|display=inline}}.<ref name=\"uareporter\"/> The larger receiver building has been demolished and was located at {{coord|48|23|18.41|N|22|47|37.71|E|name=Mukachevo Daryal radar receiver|display=inline}}. The azimuth of the Daryal was 218\u00b0 (south west).<ref name=\"Podvig-History\" />\n\n==Dispute with Ukraine==\nIn 1991 the Soviet Union [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapsed]] and the station ended up in the newly independent country of Ukraine, together with the radar in [[Sevastopol Radar Station|Sevastopol]]. Russia signed a 15-year agreement with Ukraine in 1992 <!-- Podvig book says 1997--> to rent both radars for [[USD|$]]840,000 per year, although unlike other overseas stations the radar was to be staffed by Ukrainians not Russians.<ref name=\"CES\"/><ref name=Rian-sprn/> In 2005 management of the radars transferred from the military to the civil [[Ukrainian National Space Agency]] and the rent increased to $1.3 million, although Ukraine asked for more.<ref name=\"Kommersant2008\"/><ref name=\"Kommersant2005\"/>\n\nIn 2008 Russia decided to stop using information from the two Ukrainian radar stations.<ref name=\"RIAN2008\"/><ref name=\"Podvig-Ukr2\"/> According to some commentators it was partly about the then Ukrainian government's stated intention to join NATO.<ref name=\"CES\"/><ref name=\"RIAN2008\"/> In 2007 [[Vladimir Popovkin]] had stated that Russia intended to duplicate or replace foreign radar stations as it could not rely on them in times of crisis.<ref name=\"NK2007\"/> Replacing the station would reduce any leverage Ukraine was gaining over Russia from the ability to control access to the data.<ref name=\"CES\"/><ref name=Rian-sprn/><ref name=\"9ABC\"/>\n\nPragmatic reasons were given for ending the lease. Popovkin said that the radars went out of warranty in 2005, and would cost $20m to modernise. In addition Russia said that the data from Sevastopol was unreliable due to [[pirate radio]] broadcasts from fishing boats in the Black Sea.<ref name=\"RIAN2008\"/><ref name=\"Podvig-Ukr2\"/> Furthermore, it had concerns with the quality of the data due to the civilian rather than military operators.<ref name=\"RIAN2008\"/><ref name=\"Podvig-Ukr1\"/>\n\nData from Ukraine stopped on 26 February 2009 and Russia declared that a new [[Voronezh radar]] station in [[Armavir Radar Station|Armavir]] had begun operation on the same date, replacing the lost coverage.<ref name=\"Podvig-Armavir2\"/>{{r|baev|page1=76}} Following this the Ukrainian government announced that the stations would be closed for a month for maintenance and then used part-time for space surveillance, being part of an organisation called SKAKO (Automatic System of Control and Analysis of Outer Space).<ref name=\"Kievpost2009\"/><ref name=\"Kievpost2010\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*

Information from this station could be used for a [[launch on warning]] nuclear missile attack<ref name=\"Podvig-operational\"/> or to engage the [[A-135 anti-ballistic missile system]].\n\n==Radar==\n[[File:Mukacheve Daryal-UM LPAR 02.jpg|thumb|Daryal-UM receiver building in 2003]]\nThe radar is a [[dnepr radar|Dnepr]] ([[NATO reporting name|NATO name]]: HEN HOUSE) phased array radar, and was the last one of this type to be built by the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Podvig-History\"/> It consists of a central building and two long wings over 250 metres long; each wing is a separate radar array. One had an [[azimuth]] of 196\u00b0 (south west) and the other 260\u00b0 (facing west).<ref name=\"Podvig-History\" /> The radar had a range of {{convert|3000|km|mi|0}}.<ref name=\"RTI-Radar\" />\n\nThe radar started to be built in the early 1970s. Some sources say that it started operating in 1977,<ref name=\"nk-sprn\"/> others say it became operational on 16 January 1979.<ref name=\"Podvig-History\" /><ref name=\"Kommersant2008\"/>\n\nA second generation radar, a [[Daryal radar|Daryal]]-UM, was started at a different location outside of Mukacheve, {{convert|6.7|km}} away, north of the village of Pistryalovo. It was planned that this would replace the Dnepr but construction stopped in 1991, when the Soviet Union collapsed, and never restarted.<ref name=\"Podvig-History\" /> The Daryal has separate receiver and transmitter buildings, at Mukachevo they are {{convert|630|m}} apart. The transmitter building is ruined, was being demolished in autumn 2011, and is at {{coord|48|23|6.56|N|22|48|1.72|E|name=Mukachevo Daryal radar transmitter|display=inline}}.<ref name=\"uareporter\"/> The larger receiver building has been demolished and was located at {{coord|48|23|18.41|N|22|47|37.71|E|name=Mukachevo Daryal radar receiver|display=inline}}. The azimuth of the Daryal was 218\u00b0 (south west).<ref name=\"Podvig-History\" />\n\n==Dispute with Ukraine==\nIn 1991 the Soviet Union [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapsed]] and the station ended up in the newly independent country of Ukraine, together with the radar in [[Sevastopol Radar Station|Sevastopol]]. Russia signed a 15-year agreement with Ukraine in 1992 <!-- Podvig book says 1997--> to rent both radars for [[USD|$]]840,000 per year, although unlike other overseas stations the radar was to be staffed by Ukrainians not Russians.<ref name=\"CES\"/><ref name=Rian-sprn/> In 2005 management of the radars transferred from the military to the civil [[Ukrainian National Space Agency]] and the rent increased to $1.3 million, although Ukraine asked for more.<ref name=\"Kommersant2008\"/><ref name=\"Kommersant2005\"/>\n\nIn 2008 Russia decided to stop using information from the two Ukrainian radar stations.<ref name=\"RIAN2008\"/><ref name=\"Podvig-Ukr2\"/> According to some commentators it was partly about the then Ukrainian government's stated intention to join NATO.<ref name=\"CES\"/><ref name=\"RIAN2008\"/> In 2007 [[Vladimir Popovkin]] had stated that Russia intended to duplicate or replace foreign radar stations as it could not rely on them in times of crisis.<ref name=\"NK2007\"/> Replacing the station would reduce any leverage Ukraine was gaining over Russia from the ability to control access to the data.<ref name=\"CES\"/><ref name=Rian-sprn/><ref name=\"9ABC\"/>\n\nPragmatic reasons were given for ending the lease. Popovkin said that the radars went out of warranty in 2005, and would cost $20m to modernise. In addition Russia said that the data from Sevastopol was unreliable due to [[pirate radio]] broadcasts from fishing boats in the Black Sea.<ref name=\"RIAN2008\"/><ref name=\"Podvig-Ukr2\"/> Furthermore, it had concerns with the quality of the data due to the civilian rather than military operators.<ref name=\"RIAN2008\"/><ref name=\"Podvig-Ukr1\"/>\n\nData from Ukraine stopped on 26 February 2009 and Russia declared that a new [[Voronezh radar]] station in [[Armavir Radar Station|Armavir]] had begun operation on the same date, replacing the lost coverage.<ref name=\"Podvig-Armavir2\"/>{{r|baev|page1=76}} Following this the Ukrainian government announced that the stations would be closed for a month for maintenance and then used part-time for space surveillance, being part of an organisation called SKAKO (Automatic System of Control and Analysis of Outer Space).<ref name=\"Kievpost2009\"/><ref name=\"Kievpost2010\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*
