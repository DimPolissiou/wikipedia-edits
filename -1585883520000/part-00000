Expenses at this time for a full year were $206.50 (equal to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|206.50|1870|r=-1}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) and remained relatively unchanged for the next 50 years.\n\n===Early history (1866\u20131897)===\nThe College was founded by and initially associated with the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]]. Today, Lebanon Valley College is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]], which occurred through a series of church mergers: The Church of the United Brethren in Christ merged with the [[Evangelical Association]] in 1946 creating the [[Evangelical United Brethren|Evangelical United Brethren Church]] (EUB), which subsequently merged with the [[Methodist Church]] in 1968 to create the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818141615/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archivedate=2000-08-18|title=EVANGELICAL UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH. The Columbia Encyclopedia: Sixth Edition. 2000|date=18 August 2000|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref> The ties to the Methodist Church are not as strong as they once were, which is evidenced by the lack of mandatory chapel services, but the church maintains a presence on the campus. Out of 34 colleges and academies founded by the United Brethren in Christ Church, Lebanon Valley was one of four to survive.\n\nThe campus began as a single building, the empty Annville Academy building, which was purchased for $4,500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4500|1866|r=-4}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) by five Annville citizens. They presented the building as a gift to the East Pennsylvania Conference of the United Brethren Church to settle the argument over where to establish the college. In a little more than two months from its founding, 12 trustees were appointed, President Thomas R. Vickroy was elected, the building repaired and redecorated, a curriculum devised, faculty recruited, and classes begun. The College was entirely contained in that one building (class rooms, student residence, president's residence, and \"dining hall\") until 1868 when \"North College\" was opened at a cost of $31,500, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|31500|1868|r=-4}}}}  in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}. The Annville Academy building became known as \"South Hall\" or \"Ladies Hall\" as the North College building was now the home to the men's dormitories.\n\nA note worth mentioning: The college charter, granted in 1867, specifically stated that Lebanon Valley College was established for the education of ''both'' sexes. Indeed, Lebanon Valley College can claim that it has been coeducational longer than any other college east of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. However, the curricula were different for men and women, a condition created from a compromise after an uproar in the founding church over the equal treatment of men and women. The \"Ladies Course\" included modern languages, painting, drawing, wax flower and fruit making, and music. By 1878, the college catalog began announcing that experience showed that there was no difference between men and women in their ability to master college courses, an unpopular idea at its time.\n\nThis was also the time of the founding literary societies: Philokosmian, Clionian, and Kalozetean, which bear no resemblance to their present fraternity and sorority selves. They met regularly to debate topics and discuss essays. Other activities included mixed socials, parades, the annual Chestnut Picnic, and other special events throughout the years.\n\n===Growth (1897\u20131948)===\nThe College steadily grew during its first 35 years, and by 1904, the campus had expanded to include Engle Hall, home of the music department, and a partially completed library funded by [[Andrew Carnegie]]. On Christmas Eve 1904, North College (not to be confused with the residence hall with the same name), which stood in the current footprint of the Administration/Humanities building, burned down. The next year, the college raised funds to rebuild and also began expanding the campus further, building not only a new Administration Building (the current Humanities Building), but also North Hall (a women's dorm, currently the site of Miller Chapel), Kreider Hall (a men's residence hall where the current Neidig-Garber Science Center is located), the central heating plant (still in existence), a science building, and a gymnasium. However, funding ran out, debt rose, and building halted on the gym and science buildings. President Hervin U. Roop resigned in disgrace on New Year's Day, 1906. It was not until President Lawrence W. Keister took office on June 12, 1907 that the debt situation was solved. Thanks to his fundraising efforts, the debt was eliminated by 1911. The College landscape remained relatively unchanged for the next four decades, under the leadership of President George D. Gossard (1912\u20131932) and [[Clyde A. Lynch]] (1932\u20131950).<ref>''Pennsylvania School Journal'', Volume 81 (Pennsylvania State Education Association, 1932), p. 285</ref> <ref>\u201dDr Clyde A. Lynch\u201d (obituary) in ''The Torch'', Volumes 23-24 (International Association of Torch Clubs, 1950), p. 41</ref>\n\nCultural changes at LVC paralleled those in the rest of the country, moving through [[World War I]], the [[Roaring Twenties]], the [[Great Depression]], and the [[New Deal]].\n\n===Mid-century and modern day (1948\u2013present)===\n[[World War II]] nearly proved to be the end of Lebanon Valley College. In the Fall of 1942, LVC's first wartime registration showed only 357 students enrolled. As the second semester began in 1943, there were only 282 students: 145 women and 137 men, the first time that women outnumbered men. 1943 Fall enrollment dropped again to only 199 students, 62 of which were on limited deferment, waiting to be called to active duty. This prompted one of the first capital campaigns to help the ailing College. The campaign to raise $550,000 received 91% support from current students. The money was to go toward an endowment and a real gymnasium, which bore the name of the president who initiated the campaign\u2014Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall. Right before the war ended, LVC enrollment hit bottom at 192 students. In 1946, however, enrollment ballooned to 683 students, more than 300 of which were ex-servicemen.\n\nEnrollment steadily grew and by 1948, thanks to the [[G.I. Bill]], it had reached 817 full-time students, far beyond the college's capacity. Eventually additional facilities and residences were added to the college. Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall\u2014which included the school's first proper gymnasium\u2014was opened in 1953. In 1957, Science Hall (now the Derickson A apartments) was created out of the old Kreider Factory building on White Oak St., and Gossard Library also opened that year. In 1966, Frederic K. Miller Chapel was completed. The 1950s also saw the college expand north of Sheridan Avenue, with the Dining Hall (now Lehr and Phillips Dining Hall) built in 1958. Other current traditional residence halls were built between the 1950s and 1970s as well\u2014Mary Green (1956) and Vickroy (1960) in the 1950s-60s, Hammond and Keister Hall in 1965, and Funkhouser and Silver in the 1970s. Marquette and Dellinger were added in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and Stanson was added in 2009.\n\nEnrollment also grew, although it had stagnated by the 1980s. A turnaround began under the presidency of Arthur L. Peterson, whose tenure in office was cut short due to health issues. Soon thereafter, a highly energetic president, John Synodinos, ushered in a period of growth and change with the bold introduction of merit scholarships and the renovation and beautification of a substantial portion of the campus that included the addition of the Edward H. Arnold Sports Center and the Suzanne H. Arnold Art Gallery and Zimmerman Recital hall. With the assistance of Dr. William J. McGill, senior vice president and the dean of the faculty, academic excellence continued to be emphasized, linkages were established with other institutions and schools, an international initiative undertaken, and collaborative learning experiences developed. A new technologically advanced library, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library, opened in January 1996.\n\nBeginning in 1996 and building on the work of his predecessor, Dr. G. David Pollick\u2019s eight-year presidency ushered in a period of continued growth. There was a 40 percent increase in undergraduate enrollment with applications more than doubling. New undergraduate and graduate degree programs were added and there was a large increase in the number of first-year students who studied abroad.  A major public relations focus to enhance the college's standing among peer institutions was followed by a major rebuilding and renovation effort on campus and the start of a $50 million campaign, Great Expectations. Pollick oversaw a growth plan that added athletic teams, more than a dozen new campus buildings and athletic facilities, and the college's signature Fasick Bridge. These additions almost tripled the usable space of the college, including five new facilities: the Marquette and Dellinger Residence Halls, the Allan W. Mund College Center, Sorrentino Gymnasium, and the Heilman Center. A revitalization of Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall and the Neidig-Garber Science Center also were begun during this period.\n[[File:LVC Peace Garden.jpg|thumb|250x250px|An aerial view of LVC's Peace Garden, taken by Blue Fuego. The Peace Garden is in the middle of the college's Residential Quad and is a popular place to study, relax, or take milestone photographs, especially weddings.]]\nToday, the campus consists of 40 buildings, including the recently renovated Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library (revitalized in 2016), the Heilman Center for communication sciences & disorders/speech-language pathology, and $20 million Jeanne and Edward H. Arnold Health Professions Pavilion (opened August 2018) for athletic training, exercise science, and physical therapy. Students received career advice from experts in the Edward and Lynn Breen Center for Graduate Success (launched programming in 2018) and study under the college's new general education curriculum, Constellation LVC (started in fall 2016). Students reside in one of 25 residence halls that include traditional single-sex and co-educational dormitories and apartment-style residences. Students may also reside in special interest houses upon proposal and approval of LVC administration. A small number of upperclassmen are allowed to live off-campus, and a significant portion of the student body are commuter students as well. Undergraduate enrollment is now over 1,638 students.\n\nThe endowment of the college is sixty-five million dollars.\n\n===Lost lore and traditions===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}{{Original research section|date=April 2017}}\nMany college traditions have disappeared and been forgotten, much to the chagrin of most alumni. At most colleges and universities, there seems to be a compulsion to make fools of the freshman students. Lebanon Valley College was no different in this regard, as most of the traditions existed for this very reason.\n\n====May Day====\nA festive tradition, this pageant was begun in 1912. Each year, a May Queen would be elected and would watch over the festival with her court. Typical [[May Day]] activities took place, including the expected [[May pole]]. This tradition seems to have persisted for 55 years until the late 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

One evening after a football game, President Gossard had decided to change the policy and allowed the students to dance with his blessing. From then on, the literary societies began holding annual dinner dances. Formal proms were organized and any opportunity for dancing was not overlooked.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

The UG is a place where students can go to have fun with their classmates and friends on most Saturday nights.  The UG plays popular hits from today's music and is open to non-LVC students at a small price.\n\n'''March to the President's House'''\n\nIn a tradition that dates to the presidency of [[Clyde A. Lynch]] '18 [1932\u20131950] students march to the president's home, Kreiderheim since 1976, to request the day off before Thanksgiving when the football team defeats Albright College. LVC defeated Albright in double overtime in 2018 and President Thayne granted the students' wish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godutchmen.com/news/2018/11/12/football-day-off-you-got-it-students-march-on-kreiderheim.aspx?path=football|title=Day Off?

Expenses at this time for a full year were $206.50 (equal to approximately ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|206.50|1870|r=-1}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) and remained relatively unchanged for the next 50 years.\n\n===Early history (1866\u20131897)===\nThe College was founded by and initially associated with the [[Church of the United Brethren in Christ]]. Today, Lebanon Valley College is affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]], which occurred through a series of church mergers: The Church of the United Brethren in Christ merged with the [[Evangelical Association]] in 1946 creating the [[Evangelical United Brethren|Evangelical United Brethren Church]] (EUB), which subsequently merged with the [[Methodist Church]] in 1968 to create the [[United Methodist Church]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000818141615/http://www.bartleby.com/65/ev/EvangUBC.html|archivedate=2000-08-18|title=EVANGELICAL UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH. The Columbia Encyclopedia: Sixth Edition. 2000|date=18 August 2000|publisher=|accessdate=1 November 2018}}</ref> The ties to the Methodist Church are not as strong as they once were, which is evidenced by the lack of mandatory chapel services, but the church maintains a presence on the campus. Out of 34 colleges and academies founded by the United Brethren in Christ Church, Lebanon Valley was one of four to survive.\n\nThe campus began as a single building, the empty Annville Academy building, which was purchased for $4,500 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4500|1866|r=-4}}}} in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}) by five Annville citizens. They presented the building as a gift to the East Pennsylvania Conference of the United Brethren Church to settle the argument over where to establish the college. In a little more than two months from its founding, 12 trustees were appointed, President Thomas R. Vickroy was elected, the building repaired and redecorated, a curriculum devised, faculty recruited, and classes begun. The College was entirely contained in that one building (class rooms, student residence, president's residence, and \"dining hall\") until 1868 when \"North College\" was opened at a cost of $31,500, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|31500|1868|r=-4}}}}  in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}}. The Annville Academy building became known as \"South Hall\" or \"Ladies Hall\" as the North College building was now the home to the men's dormitories.\n\nA note worth mentioning: The college charter, granted in 1867, specifically stated that Lebanon Valley College was established for the education of ''both'' sexes. Indeed, Lebanon Valley College can claim that it has been coeducational longer than any other college east of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. However, the curricula were different for men and women, a condition created from a compromise after an uproar in the founding church over the equal treatment of men and women. The \"Ladies Course\" included modern languages, painting, drawing, wax flower and fruit making, and music. By 1878, the college catalog began announcing that experience showed that there was no difference between men and women in their ability to master college courses, an unpopular idea at its time.\n\nThis was also the time of the founding literary societies: Philokosmian, Clionian, and Kalozetean, which bear no resemblance to their present fraternity and sorority selves. They met regularly to debate topics and discuss essays. Other activities included mixed socials, parades, the annual Chestnut Picnic, and other special events throughout the years.\n\n===Growth (1897\u20131948)===\nThe College steadily grew during its first 35 years, and by 1904, the campus had expanded to include Engle Hall, home of the music department, and a partially completed library funded by [[Andrew Carnegie]]. On Christmas Eve 1904, North College (not to be confused with the residence hall with the same name), which stood in the current footprint of the Administration/Humanities building, burned down. The next year, the college raised funds to rebuild and also began expanding the campus further, building not only a new Administration Building (the current Humanities Building), but also North Hall (a women's dorm, currently the site of Miller Chapel), Kreider Hall (a men's residence hall where the current Neidig-Garber Science Center is located), the central heating plant (still in existence), a science building, and a gymnasium. However, funding ran out, debt rose, and building halted on the gym and science buildings. President Hervin U. Roop resigned in disgrace on New Year's Day, 1906. It was not until President Lawrence W. Keister took office on June 12, 1907 that the debt situation was solved. Thanks to his fundraising efforts, the debt was eliminated by 1911. The College landscape remained relatively unchanged for the next four decades, under the leadership of President George D. Gossard (1912\u20131932) and [[Clyde A. Lynch]] (1932\u20131950).<ref>''Pennsylvania School Journal'', Volume 81 (Pennsylvania State Education Association, 1932), p. 285</ref> <ref>\u201dDr Clyde A. Lynch\u201d (obituary) in ''The Torch'', Volumes 23-24 (International Association of Torch Clubs, 1950), p. 41</ref>\n\nCultural changes at LVC paralleled those in the rest of the country, moving through [[World War I]], the [[Roaring Twenties]], the [[Great Depression]], and the [[New Deal]].\n\n===Mid-century and modern day (1948\u2013present)===\n[[World War II]] nearly proved to be the end of Lebanon Valley College. In the Fall of 1942, LVC's first wartime registration showed only 357 students enrolled. As the second semester began in 1943, there were only 282 students: 145 women and 137 men, the first time that women outnumbered men. 1943 Fall enrollment dropped again to only 199 students, 62 of which were on limited deferment, waiting to be called to active duty. This prompted one of the first capital campaigns to help the ailing College. The campaign to raise $550,000 received 91% support from current students. The money was to go toward an endowment and a real gymnasium, which bore the name of the president who initiated the campaign\u2014Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall. Right before the war ended, LVC enrollment hit bottom at 192 students. In 1946, however, enrollment ballooned to 683 students, more than 300 of which were ex-servicemen.\n\nEnrollment steadily grew and by 1948, thanks to the [[G.I. Bill]], it had reached 817 full-time students, far beyond the college's capacity. Eventually additional facilities and residences were added to the college. Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall\u2014which included the school's first proper gymnasium\u2014was opened in 1953. In 1957, Science Hall (now the Derickson A apartments) was created out of the old Kreider Factory building on White Oak St., and Gossard Library also opened that year. In 1966, Frederic K. Miller Chapel was completed. The 1950s also saw the college expand north of Sheridan Avenue, with the Dining Hall (now Lehr and Phillips Dining Hall) built in 1958. Other current traditional residence halls were built between the 1950s and 1970s as well\u2014Mary Green (1956) and Vickroy (1960) in the 1950s-60s, Hammond and Keister Hall in 1965, and Funkhouser and Silver in the 1970s. Marquette and Dellinger were added in 1999 and 2002, respectively, and Stanson was added in 2009.\n\nEnrollment also grew, although it had stagnated by the 1980s. A turnaround began under the presidency of Arthur L. Peterson, whose tenure in office was cut short due to health issues. Soon thereafter, a highly energetic president, John Synodinos, ushered in a period of growth and change with the bold introduction of merit scholarships and the renovation and beautification of a substantial portion of the campus that included the addition of the Edward H. Arnold Sports Center and the Suzanne H. Arnold Art Gallery and Zimmerman Recital hall. With the assistance of Dr. William J. McGill, senior vice president and the dean of the faculty, academic excellence continued to be emphasized, linkages were established with other institutions and schools, an international initiative undertaken, and collaborative learning experiences developed. A new technologically advanced library, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library, opened in January 1996.\n\nBeginning in 1996 and building on the work of his predecessor, Dr. G. David Pollick\u2019s eight-year presidency ushered in a period of continued growth. There was a 40 percent increase in undergraduate enrollment with applications more than doubling. New undergraduate and graduate degree programs were added and there was a large increase in the number of first-year students who studied abroad.  A major public relations focus to enhance the college's standing among peer institutions was followed by a major rebuilding and renovation effort on campus and the start of a $50 million campaign, Great Expectations. Pollick oversaw a growth plan that added athletic teams, more than a dozen new campus buildings and athletic facilities, and the college's signature Fasick Bridge. These additions almost tripled the usable space of the college, including five new facilities: the Marquette and Dellinger Residence Halls, the Allan W. Mund College Center, Sorrentino Gymnasium, and the Heilman Center. A revitalization of Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall and the Neidig-Garber Science Center also were begun during this period.\n[[File:LVC Peace Garden.jpg|thumb|250x250px|An aerial view of LVC's Peace Garden, taken by Blue Fuego. The Peace Garden is in the middle of the college's Residential Quad and is a popular place to study, relax, or take milestone photographs, especially weddings.]]\nToday, the campus consists of 40 buildings, including the recently renovated Clyde A. Lynch Memorial Hall, the Vernon and Doris Bishop Library (revitalized in 2016), the Heilman Center for communication sciences & disorders/speech-language pathology, and $20 million Jeanne and Edward H. Arnold Health Professions Pavilion (opened August 2018) for athletic training, exercise science, and physical therapy. Students received career advice from experts in the Edward and Lynn Breen Center for Graduate Success (launched programming in 2018) and study under the college's new general education curriculum, Constellation LVC (started in fall 2016). Students reside in one of 25 residence halls that include traditional single-sex and co-educational dormitories and apartment-style residences. Students may also reside in special interest houses upon proposal and approval of LVC administration. A small number of upperclassmen are allowed to live off-campus, and a significant portion of the student body are commuter students as well. Undergraduate enrollment is now over 1,638 students.\n\nThe endowment of the college is sixty-five million dollars.\n\n===Lost lore and traditions===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}{{Original research section|date=April 2017}}\nMany college traditions have disappeared and been forgotten, much to the chagrin of most alumni. At most colleges and universities, there seems to be a compulsion to make fools of the freshman students. Lebanon Valley College was no different in this regard, as most of the traditions existed for this very reason.\n\n====May Day====\nA festive tradition, this pageant was begun in 1912. Each year, a May Queen would be elected and would watch over the festival with her court. Typical [[May Day]] activities took place, including the expected [[May pole]]. This tradition seems to have persisted for 55 years until the late 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

One evening after a football game, President Gossard had decided to change the policy and allowed the students to dance with his blessing. From then on, the literary societies began holding annual dinner dances. Formal proms were organized and any opportunity for dancing was not overlooked.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/OfHighGradeASesquicentennialHistoryOfLebanonValleyCollege|title=Of High Grade: A Sesquicentennial History of Lebanon Valley College|last=Williams|first=Rev.

The UG is a place where students can go to have fun with their classmates and friends on most Saturday nights.  The UG plays popular hits from today's music and is open to non-LVC students at a small price.\n\n'''March to the President's House'''\n\nIn a tradition that dates to the presidency of [[Clyde A. Lynch]] '18 [1932\u20131950] students march to the president's home, Kreiderheim since 1976, to request the day off before Thanksgiving when the football team defeats Albright College. LVC defeated Albright in double overtime in 2018 and President Thayne granted the students' wish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godutchmen.com/news/2018/11/12/football-day-off-you-got-it-students-march-on-kreiderheim.aspx?path=football|title=Day Off?

It is located near the midpoint of the [[Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor]] and is surrounded by [[Red Deer County]]. It is Alberta's third most populous city{{cn|date=March 2020}} after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and before [[Lethbridge]]. The city is located in [[aspen parkland]], a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and cattle production. It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. With a recorded population of 100,418 in the Canada [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Red Deer became the third Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people.<ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area was a gathering place that was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes including the [[Blackfoot]], Plains [[Cree]] and [[Stoney First Nation|Stoney]]. European fur traders began passing through the area in the late eighteenth century. Into this ethnic mix, the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples also emerged.\n\nA [[First Nations|native trail]] ran from [[Montana]] in the south across the [[Bow River]] near Calgary and on to [[Fort Edmonton]]. About halfway between Calgary and Edmonton, the trail crossed the [[Red Deer River]] at a wide, stony shallow used by [[First Nations]] peoples and [[American bison|bison]], [[Bison vs Buffalo|commonly known as buffalo]], since ancient times. The shallows, now known as the Old Red Deer Crossing, are about {{convert|7|km}} upstream from the present City of Red Deer.\n\nWith the establishment of [[Fort Calgary]] by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in 1875, traffic increased along what was by then known as the [[Calgary and Edmonton Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calgary and Edmonton Trail |author=Alberta Trail Net |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2009-09-14 ||url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705020554/http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> After the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in Calgary, traffic along the \"C & E\" trail increased substantially. A [[trading post]] and [[stopping house]] were built at the Crossing in 1882 and a permanent settlement began to develop around it.\n\nDuring the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] (also known as the [[North-West Rebellion]]), the [[Canadian militia]] constructed [[Fort Normandeau]] at the Crossing. The fort was later taken over by the North-West Mounted Police who used it until 1893.\n\nWith the decimation of the bison by hunters, the Aboriginal tribes who relied on them for food, clothing and shelter were also in decline. The fertile lands around the Red Deer River were attractive to farmers and ranchers. One early settler, the Reverend Leonard Gaetz, gave a half-share of {{convert|1240|acre|km2}} he had acquired to the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first train from Calgary to Edmonton passed through Red Deer in 1891.\n\n=== Name origin ===\nThe [[Cree]] peoples called the river on which Red Deer stands {{transl|cr|Waskasoo Seepee}}, which translates to \"[[Elk]] River\". However, British traders translated the name as \"Red Deer River\", since they mistakenly thought elk were European [[red deer]]. Later, the settlers of the area named their community after the river.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | title=History of Red Deer | publisher=City of Red Deer | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204024702/http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | archivedate=December 4, 2013 | df= }}</ref> The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a [[calque]] back from English of the mistranslated, {{transl|cr|mihkw\u00e2pisimosos}} literally \"red type of deer\" while the name of the river itself is still {{transl|cr|w\u00e2w\u00e2sk\u00easiw-s\u00eepiy}} or \"elk river\".<ref>http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=Red+Deer&scope=0</ref>\n\n=== Leonard Gaetz ===\n{{Main|Leonard Gaetz}}\n[[Leonard Gaetz]] acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer.\n\nIn 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \"Westerner Days\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. He died in Red Deer in 1907.\n\n=== 1900 to 1929 ===\nRed Deer saw a massive influx of settlers in the early 1900s.\n[[File:Michener Centre.jpg|thumbnail|Michener Centre]]\nIn 1901, when Red Deer was incorporated as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 when it was chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the [[Alberta Central Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.\n\nOn March 25, 1913, Red Deer was incorporated as a city and the population had jumped to nearly 2,800.\n\n[[World War I]] brought a sharp end to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial institution for the care of the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.\n\n=== 1930 to 1945 ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was a major setback for the city, though it fared better than some communities. Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.\n\nGrowth returned to the city with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Red Deer was chosen as the location of a large military training camp, the A-20 Camp which was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now located. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] built two air bases to the south of the city at [[Penhold, Alberta|Penhold]] and [[Bowden, Alberta|Bowden]].\n\n=== Post Second World War ===\nOn January 1, 1948, the City of Red Deer amalgamated with the Village of [[North Red Deer, Alberta|North Red Deer]], located on the north bank of the Red Deer River.<ref name=Century>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=North Red Deer: A Century of Change | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123524/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | archive-date=2011-09-28 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref><ref name=Centennial>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=2011 Village of North Red Deer Centennial Celebrations | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623224607/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | archive-date=2011-06-23 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBy roughly 1991, the Canadian Pacific Railway had been removed from the inner city; the track currently runs parallel to the city outskirts. The most prominent landmark of the railway remaining is the CPR bridge spanning the Red Deer River, converted to a walking trail shortly after the track removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe city is now a centre for [[petroleum extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas extraction]] and related industries and also for agriculture and agricultural services. It is a regional centre for administration with a courthouse and provincial building. It also has major stores in malls such as Bower Place, Southpointe Common, Parkland Mall and many other locations.\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Deer is located on the [[Red Deer River]] after which it was named.\n\n=== Climate ===\nRed Deer has a humid [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''), with somewhat of a semi-arid influence.

It is located near the midpoint of the [[Calgary\u2013Edmonton Corridor]] and is surrounded by [[Red Deer County]]. It is Alberta's third most populous city{{cn|date=March 2020}} after [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], and before [[Lethbridge]]. The city is located in [[aspen parkland]], a region of rolling hills that is home to oil, grain, and cattle production. It is a centre for oil and agriculture distribution, and the surrounding region is a major centre for petrochemical production. With a recorded population of 100,418 in the Canada [[2016 Canadian Census|2016 census]], Red Deer became the third Alberta city to surpass 100,000 people.<ref name=2016censusABmunis/>\n\n== History ==\nPrior to European settlement, the area was a gathering place that was inhabited by Aboriginal tribes including the [[Blackfoot]], Plains [[Cree]] and [[Stoney First Nation|Stoney]]. European fur traders began passing through the area in the late eighteenth century. Into this ethnic mix, the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]] peoples also emerged.\n\nA [[First Nations|native trail]] ran from [[Montana]] in the south across the [[Bow River]] near Calgary and on to [[Fort Edmonton]]. About halfway between Calgary and Edmonton, the trail crossed the [[Red Deer River]] at a wide, stony shallow used by [[First Nations]] peoples and [[American bison|bison]], [[Bison vs Buffalo|commonly known as buffalo]], since ancient times. The shallows, now known as the Old Red Deer Crossing, are about {{convert|7|km}} upstream from the present City of Red Deer.\n\nWith the establishment of [[Fort Calgary]] by the [[North-West Mounted Police]] in 1875, traffic increased along what was by then known as the [[Calgary and Edmonton Trail]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |format=PDF |title=Calgary and Edmonton Trail |author=Alberta Trail Net |date=December 2002 |accessdate=2009-09-14 ||url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705020554/http://www.albertatrailnet.com/downloads/December2002.pdf |archivedate=July 5, 2008 }}</ref> After the arrival of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] in Calgary, traffic along the \"C & E\" trail increased substantially. A [[trading post]] and [[stopping house]] were built at the Crossing in 1882 and a permanent settlement began to develop around it.\n\nDuring the 1885 [[North-West Rebellion|Riel Rebellion]] (also known as the [[North-West Rebellion]]), the [[Canadian militia]] constructed [[Fort Normandeau]] at the Crossing. The fort was later taken over by the North-West Mounted Police who used it until 1893.\n\nWith the decimation of the bison by hunters, the Aboriginal tribes who relied on them for food, clothing and shelter were also in decline. The fertile lands around the Red Deer River were attractive to farmers and ranchers. One early settler, the Reverend Leonard Gaetz, gave a half-share of {{convert|1240|acre|km2}} he had acquired to the [[Calgary and Edmonton Railway]] to develop a bridge over the river and a townsite. As a result, the Crossing was gradually abandoned. The first train from Calgary to Edmonton passed through Red Deer in 1891.\n\n=== Name origin ===\nThe [[Cree]] peoples called the river on which Red Deer stands {{transl|cr|Waskasoo Seepee}}, which translates to \"[[Elk]] River\". However, British traders translated the name as \"Red Deer River\", since they mistakenly thought elk were European [[red deer]]. Later, the settlers of the area named their community after the river.<ref name=history>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | title=History of Red Deer | publisher=City of Red Deer | accessdate=November 15, 2013 | |url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204024702/http://www.reddeer.ca/Visitors/About+Red+Deer/History/default.htm | archivedate=December 4, 2013 | df= }}</ref> The name for the modern city in Plains Cree is a [[calque]] back from English of the mistranslated, {{transl|cr|mihkw\u00e2pisimosos}} literally \"red type of deer\" while the name of the river itself is still {{transl|cr|w\u00e2w\u00e2sk\u00easiw-s\u00eepiy}} or \"elk river\".<ref>http://www.creedictionary.com/search/?q=Red+Deer&scope=0</ref>\n\n=== Leonard Gaetz ===\n{{Main|Leonard Gaetz}}\n[[Leonard Gaetz]] acted as the local land agent for the Saskatchewan Colonization Company and purchased parts of three other sections from his employers. By 1890, the Gaetz family owned vast land holdings along the south bank of the Red Deer River around the mouth of the Waskasoo Creek. The holdings included parts of Sections 16, 17, 20 and 21. Leonard Gaetz's increasing wealth allowed his family to play a central role in the growth of Red Deer.\n\nIn 1895, Gaetz returned to the active ministry in Manitoba. Once again, this proved detrimental to his health. He retired back to Red Deer in 1901, and resided here for the remainder of his life. He was a strong promoter of the area, founding the Westerner showgrounds and annual \"Westerner Days\", akin to the Calgary Stampede. He died in Red Deer in 1907.\n\n=== 1900 to 1929 ===\nRed Deer saw a massive influx of settlers in the early 1900s.\n[[File:Michener Centre.jpg|thumbnail|Michener Centre]]\nIn 1901, when Red Deer was incorporated as a town, the population stood at 343. Through its location midway between Edmonton and Calgary and the fertile land that supported profitable mixed farming, Red Deer developed primarily as an agricultural service and distribution centre. A further boost came in 1907 when it was chosen as a major divisional point for the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two other railways, the [[Alberta Central Railway]] and the [[Canadian Northern Railway]], entered the community in 1911. Red Deer underwent a large land boom.\n\nOn March 25, 1913, Red Deer was incorporated as a city and the population had jumped to nearly 2,800.\n\n[[World War I]] brought a sharp end to the boom. Red Deer emerged as a small, quiet, but prosperous, prairie city. In 1922, the provincial institution for the care of the mentally handicapped, currently known as the Michener Centre, was established in the city. Prospects looked good for modest but sustainable growth.\n\n=== 1930 to 1945 ===\nThe [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s was a major setback for the city, though it fared better than some communities. Central Alberta was not hit by severe drought. The city was virtually debt-free and profited from its ownership of the local public utilities.\n\nGrowth returned to the city with the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Red Deer was chosen as the location of a large military training camp, the A-20 Camp which was located where Cormack Armoury, the Memorial Centre and Lindsay Thurber High School are now located. The [[British Commonwealth Air Training Plan]] built two air bases to the south of the city at [[Penhold, Alberta|Penhold]] and [[Bowden, Alberta|Bowden]].\n\n=== Post Second World War ===\nOn January 1, 1948, the City of Red Deer amalgamated with the Village of [[North Red Deer, Alberta|North Red Deer]], located on the north bank of the Red Deer River.<ref name=Century>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=North Red Deer: A Century of Change | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928123524/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/North+Red+Deer+A+Century+of+Change.htm | archive-date=2011-09-28 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref><ref name=Centennial>{{cite web | url=http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | publisher=City of Red Deer | title=2011 Village of North Red Deer Centennial Celebrations | year=2011 | accessdate=2011-07-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623224607/http://www.reddeer.ca/City+Government/City+Services+and+Departments/Heritage/Heritage+Events/Village+of+North+Red+Deer/default.htm | archive-date=2011-06-23 | |url-status=dead | df= }}</ref>\n\nBy roughly 1991, the Canadian Pacific Railway had been removed from the inner city; the track currently runs parallel to the city outskirts. The most prominent landmark of the railway remaining is the CPR bridge spanning the Red Deer River, converted to a walking trail shortly after the track removal.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nThe city is now a centre for [[petroleum extraction|oil]] and [[natural gas extraction]] and related industries and also for agriculture and agricultural services. It is a regional centre for administration with a courthouse and provincial building. It also has major stores in malls such as Bower Place, Southpointe Common, Parkland Mall and many other locations.\n\n== Geography ==\nRed Deer is located on the [[Red Deer River]] after which it was named.\n\n=== Climate ===\nRed Deer has a humid [[continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''[[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb: Warm summer subtype|Dfb]]''), with somewhat of a semi-arid influence. The highest temperature ever recorded in Red Deer was {{convert|37.2|C|0}} on 8 July 1906,<ref name=\"July 1906\"/> 2 July 1924,<ref name=\"July 1924\"/> and 28 & 29 June 1937.<ref name=\"June

It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. The first two-game modes were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles and ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. ''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' released for those platforms, in addition for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nWhile the first two games have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' became a resounding success \u2013 drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming become a [[cultural phenomenon]].\n\n==Game modes==\nCurrently, ''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine and has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.\n\n* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is designed as player-versus-environment game, with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that help to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\n* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player battle royale game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[skydive|airdrop]] from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players, eliminating them. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.\n* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a sandbox game mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges and more. \n\nIn the first two modes, players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe.  Players are encouraged to be very creative in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.\n\nAll game modes are set to be free-to-play titles, although as of 2019, ''Save the World'' is in early access and requires purchase to play.<ref>{{cite news | title=Fortnite Save the World Is 50 Percent Off During Fortnite Lunar New Year Sale 2019 | last1=Alwani | first1=Rishi | publisher=Gadgets360 | date=February 5, 2019 | url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-save-the-world-is-50-percent-off-during-fortnite-lunar-new-year-sale-2019-1988900 }}</ref> The first two games are [[video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.

Further, Epic was looking to get into the [[games as a service]] model, and brought in Chinese publisher [[Tencent]] to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]], who had been a key part of ''Fortnite''{{'}}s development.

It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'', a cooperative [[shooter game|shooter]]-[[survival game]] for up to four players to fight off [[zombie]]-like creatures and defend objects with fortifications they can build; ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'', a free-to-play [[battle royale game]] where up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; and ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'', where players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas. The first two-game modes were released in 2017 as [[early access]] titles and ''Creative'' was released on December 6, 2018. ''Save the World'' is available only for [[Windows]], [[macOS]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]], while ''Battle Royale'' and ''Creative'' released for those platforms, in addition for [[Nintendo Switch]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.\n\nWhile the first two games have been successful for Epic Games, ''Fortnite Battle Royale'' became a resounding success \u2013 drawing in more than 125 million players in less than a year, earning hundreds of millions of dollars per month, and becoming become a [[cultural phenomenon]].\n\n==Game modes==\nCurrently, ''Fortnite'' is distributed as three different game modes, using the same engine and has similar graphics, art assets, and game mechanics.\n\n* ''[[Fortnite: Save the World]]'' is designed as player-versus-environment game, with four players cooperating towards a common objective on various missions. The game is set after a fluke storm appears across Earth, causing 98% of the population to disappear, and the survivors to be attacked by zombie-like \"husks\". The players take the role of commanders of home base shelters, collecting resources, saving survivors, and defending equipment that help to either collect data on the storm or to push back the storm. From missions, players are awarded a number of in-game items, which include hero characters, weapon and trap schematics, and survivors, all of which can be leveled up through gained experience to improve their attributes.\n* ''[[Fortnite Battle Royale]]'' is a player-versus-player battle royale game for up to 100 players, allowing one to play alone, in a duo, or in a squad (usually consisting of three or four players). Weaponless players [[skydive|airdrop]] from a \"Battle Bus\" that crosses the game's map. When they land, they must scavenge for weapons, items, resources, and even vehicles while trying to stay alive and attack other players, eliminating them. Over the course of a round, the safe area of the map shrinks down in size due to an incoming toxic storm; players outside that threshold take damage and can be eliminated if they fail to quickly evacuate. This forces remaining players into tighter spaces and encourages player encounters. The last player, duo, or squad remaining is the winner.\n* ''[[Fortnite Creative]]'' is a sandbox game mode, similar to ''[[Minecraft]]'' in that players are given complete freedom to spawn everything that is within the game on an island, and can create games such as battle arenas, race courses, platforming challenges and more. \n\nIn the first two modes, players can use their pickaxe to knock down existing structures on the map to collect basic resources that are wood, brick, and metal. Subsequently, in all modes, the player can use these materials to build fortifications, such as walls, floors, and stairs. Such fortification pieces can be edited to add things like windows or doors. The materials used have different durability properties and can be updated to stronger variants using more materials of the same type. Within ''Save the World'' this enables players to create defensive fortifications around an objective or trap-filled tunnels to lure husks through. In ''Battle Royale'', this provides the means to quickly traverse the map, protect oneself from enemy fire, or to delay an advancing foe.  Players are encouraged to be very creative in designing their fortifications in ''Creative''.\n\nAll game modes are set to be free-to-play titles, although as of 2019, ''Save the World'' is in early access and requires purchase to play.<ref>{{cite news | title=Fortnite Save the World Is 50 Percent Off During Fortnite Lunar New Year Sale 2019 | last1=Alwani | first1=Rishi | publisher=Gadgets360 | date=February 5, 2019 | url=https://gadgets.ndtv.com/games/news/fortnite-save-the-world-is-50-percent-off-during-fortnite-lunar-new-year-sale-2019-1988900 }}</ref> The first two games are [[video game monetization|monetized]] through the use of V-Bucks, in-game currency that can be purchased with real-world funds, but also earned through completing missions and other achievements in ''Save the World''.

Further, Epic was looking to get into the [[games as a service]] model, and brought in Chinese publisher [[Tencent]] to help; Tencent took a large stake in Epic as part of this, leading to the departure of several executives, including [[Cliff Bleszinski]], who had been a key part of ''Fortnite''{{'}}s development.
