It was considered a model prison because it turned a profit for the state.<ref name=\"correctionhistory.org\"/> Lynds employed the [[Auburn system]], which imposed absolute silence on the prisoners; the system was enforced by whipping and other punishments. It was John Luckey, the Prison Chaplain around 1843, who held the Principal Keeper of Sing Sing, Elam Lynds, accountable to New York Governor William H. Seward and to President of the Board of Inspectors, John Edmonds, to have Lynds removed. Chaplain Luckey proceeded to create a great religious library. His purpose was to teach correct moral principles.<ref>Adam Jay Hirsch, ''The Rise of the Penitentiary: Prisons and Punishment in Early America'', New Haven and London (1992).</ref> His religious library was challenged in 1844 when John Edmonds placed [[Eliza Farnham]] in charge of the women's ward at Sing Sing. In 1844, the New York Prison Association was inaugurated to monitor state prison administration. The NY Prison Association was made up of reformers interested in the rehabilitation and humane treatment of prisoners. Farnham was able to obtain the job largely on the recommendation of these reformers.<ref>Floyd, Janet, \"Dislocations of the self: Eliza Farnham at Sing Sing Prison\", ''Journal of American Studies'' (2006), 40(02), p. 311 (311.doi:10,1017/S0021875806001393).</ref> Farnham overturned the strictly silent practice in prison and introduced social engagement to shift concern more toward the future instead of dwelling on the criminal past. She included novels by [[Charles Dickens]] in Chaplain Luckey's religious library, novels the chaplain did not approve. This was the first documented expansion of the prison library to include moral teachings from secular literature.<ref>Vogel, Brenda, and L. Sullivan, \"Reaching Behind Bars: Library Outreach to Prisoners, 1798\u20132000\", ''The Prison Library Primer: A Program for the Twenty-first Century'', Scarecrow Press, 2009, p. 4.</ref>\n\n===Since 1900===\n[[Image:Sing Sing (prison) with warden.jpg|thumb|left|Warden T. M. Osborne]]\n\n[[Thomas Mott Osborne]]'s tenure as warden of Sing Sing was brief but dramatic. Osborne arrived in 1914 with a reputation as a radical prison reformer. His report of a week-long incognito stay inside New York's [[Auburn Correctional Facility|Auburn Prison]] indicted traditional prison administration in merciless detail.<ref>{{Gutenberg|no=33255|name=Within Prison Walls: Being a Narrative of Personal Experience During a Week of Voluntary Confinement in the State Prison at Auburn, New York|author=[[Thomas Mott Osborne]]|year=1914|bullet=none}}</ref>\n\nPrisoners who had bribed officers and intimidated other inmates lost their privileges under Osborne's regime. One of them conspired with powerful political allies to destroy Osborne's reputation, even succeeding in getting him indicted for a variety of crimes and maladministration. After Osborne triumphed in court, his return to Sing Sing was a cause for wild celebration by the inmates.<ref>Denis Brian, ''Sing Sing: The Inside Story of a Notorious Prison'', 85-112.</ref><ref>''The New York Times'': [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9902E6D9173BE633A25754C1A9619C946796D6CF \"Convicts' Carnival Welcomes Osborne\"], July 17, 1916.

He was offered the position of warden in 1919, accepted in January 1920, and remained for 21 years as Sing Sing's warden. While warden, Lawes brought about reforms and turned what was described as an \"old hellhole\" into a modern prison with sports teams, educational programs, new methods of discipline and more.

This led to a temporary ''de facto'' nationwide moratorium (executions resumed in other states in 1977), but the chair still remained. In the early-1970s, the electric chair was moved to [[Green Haven Correctional Facility]] in working condition, but was never used again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.correctionhistory.org/auburn&osborne/bighouse4.htm|title=NYCHS excerpts: Mark Gado's 'Stone Upon Stone: Sing Sing Prison'|publisher=Correctionhistory.org|date=|accessdate=2010-09-06}}</ref>\n\n==Educational programs==\nIn 1996, Katherine Vockins founded [[Rehabilitation Through the Arts]] (RTA) at Sing Sing.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">Susan Hodara, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/27topicwe.html?ex=1338004800&en=c5db82de5703b1b7&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink \"For Inmates, a Stage Paved With Hope\"], ''The New York Times'', May 27, 2007.</ref> RTA works in collaboration with theater professionals to provide prisoners with a curriculum of year-round theater-related workshops.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\"/> The RTA program has put on a number of plays at Sing Sing open to prisoners and community guests.

Understanding the positive effects of education in the transformation and rehabilitation of incarcerated people, inmates at Sing Sing Correctional Facility reached out to religious and academic volunteers to develop a college degree-granting program. Under Anne Reissner, Hudson Link for Higher Education in Prison was founded to restore college education at Sing Sing through private funding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hudsonlink.org|title=Hudson Link homepage|publisher=hudsonlink.org|date=|accessdate=2011-05-19}}</ref>\n\n=={{Anchor|Sing Sing Black Sheep}}Football team==\n\nIn 1931, new prison reforms gave Sing Sing State Penitentiary prisoners permission to partake in recreation opportunities. The [[baseball]] and [[American football|football]] teams, and the vaudeville presentations and concerts, were funded through revenue from paid attendance. [[Tim Mara]], the owner of the [[New York Giants]], sponsored the '''Sing Sing Black Sheep''', Sing Sing's football team. Mara provided equipment and uniforms and players to tutor them in fundamentals. He helped coach them the first season. Known as the Black Sheep, they were also sometimes called the Zebras. All games were \"home\" games, played at Lawes Stadium, named for Warden [[Lewis E. Lawes]]. In 1935, the starting quarterback and two other starters escaped the morning before a game.\n\n[[Alabama Pitts]] was their starting QB and star for the first four seasons, but then finished his sentence. Upon release, Alabama Pitts played for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in 1935. In 1932, \"graduate\" [[Jumbo Morano]] was signed by the Giants, and played for the [[Paterson Nighthawks]] of the [[Eastern Football League (United States)|Eastern Football League]]. In 1934, State Commissioner of Correction, [[Walter N. Thayer]] banned the advertising of activities at the prison, including football games. On November 19, 1936, a new rule banned ticket sales. No revenue would be allowed on admission to shows and sports events. This money was paying for charity for prisoners' families, especially the executed's kin, and for equipment and coaches' salaries. With this new edict, the season ended and prisoners were no longer allowed to play football outside Sing Sing.<ref>''Sing Sing Football Records'': [http://www.luckyshow.org/football/Sing%20Sing.htm \"Sing Sing\"].

It was considered a model prison because it turned a profit for the state.<ref name=\"correctionhistory.org\"/> Lynds employed the [[Auburn system]], which imposed absolute silence on the prisoners; the system was enforced by whipping and other punishments. It was John Luckey, the Prison Chaplain around 1843, who held the Principal Keeper of Sing Sing, Elam Lynds, accountable to New York Governor William H. Seward and to President of the Board of Inspectors, John Edmonds, to have Lynds removed. Chaplain Luckey proceeded to create a great religious library. His purpose was to teach correct moral principles.<ref>Adam Jay Hirsch, ''The Rise of the Penitentiary: Prisons and Punishment in Early America'', New Haven and London (1992).</ref> His religious library was challenged in 1844 when John Edmonds placed [[Eliza Farnham]] in charge of the women's ward at Sing Sing. In 1844, the New York Prison Association was inaugurated to monitor state prison administration. The NY Prison Association was made up of reformers interested in the rehabilitation and humane treatment of prisoners. Farnham was able to obtain the job largely on the recommendation of these reformers.<ref>Floyd, Janet, \"Dislocations of the self: Eliza Farnham at Sing Sing Prison\", ''Journal of American Studies'' (2006), 40(02), p. 311 (311.doi:10,1017/S0021875806001393).</ref> Farnham overturned the strictly silent practice in prison and introduced social engagement to shift concern more toward the future instead of dwelling on the criminal past. She included novels by [[Charles Dickens]] in Chaplain Luckey's religious library, novels the chaplain did not approve. This was the first documented expansion of the prison library to include moral teachings from secular literature.<ref>Vogel, Brenda, and L.

Consisting of Brenda, [[Shirley Jones (R&B singer)|Shirley]] and Valorie Jones, The Jones Girls first signed and recorded for GM Records in 1970. The trio were best known for their singles during the late\u20131970s through the 1980s; most notably 1979's \"You Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else\". After a six\u2013year tenure with GM, they then recorded for [[Philadelphia International Records]] with [[Gamble & Huff]].\n\n==History==\nThe group consisted of sisters Brenda (December 7, 1954 \u2013 April 3, 2017),<ref>[http://www.pippinfuneralhome.com/notices/Brenda-Williams Brenda Jones Williams December 7, 1954 \u2013 April 3, 2017 (age 62)]</ref><ref>[https://newsone.com/3704182/brenda-jones-62-the-jones-girls-rip/ NewsOne - Brenda Jones 62, The Jones Girls - RIP - April 3, 2017]</ref> Valorie (April 17, 1956 \u2013 December 2, 2001) and [[Shirley Jones (R&B singer)|Shirley Jones]] (born September 22, 1953). They performed as backup singers for [[Lou Rawls]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and Le Pamplemousse. They worked with [[Diana Ross]] from 1975\u201378 and were the backup singers on [[Linda Clifford]]'s 1978 album ''[[If My Friends Could See Me Now (Linda Clifford album)|If My Friends Could See Me Now]]''. They also performed on [[Tower of Power]]'s disco-themed 1979 album ''[[Back on the Streets (Tower of Power album)|Back on the Streets]]''. Their biggest hit was \"You Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else\". The song hit the [[Billboard Magazine]] Top 40 at number 38 in May 1979. The song was also a Top 5 R&B hit. It became a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]]. An additional hit followed in 1980, with the single \"I Just Love The Man\", charting at number 9 in January 1981. The less successful \"Nights Over Egypt\" (1981), written by [[Dexter Wansel]], charted at R&B #23 in 1982.\n\nAfter the release and failure of their fourth U.S. album, ''On Target'', lead singer Shirley Jones pursued a solo career and had a number 1 R&B hit on Billboard with \"[[Do You Get Enough Love]]\", from her top-ten debut album ''Always in the Mood'' (1986). \"Do You Get Enough Love\" was written by [[Bunny Sigler]] who also produced it with [[Kenny Gamble]].<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book of Number One Rhythm & Blues Hits|last=White |first=Adam |last2=Bronson |first2=Fred|authorlink2=Fred Bronson |year=1993 |publisher=Billboard Books:Watson-Guptill Publications, New York |page=368}}</ref> Valorie Jones died on December 2, 2001, in Detroit, Michigan, at the age of 45.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7742025|title=Valorie Jones (1956 - 2001) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=Findagrave.com|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref> In 2007, Shirley Jones released an album ''Ladies Night Out'' together with [[Jean Carn]] and [[Cherrelle]], on CD and DVD.\n\nBrenda eventually moved to Atlanta, where she sang frequently with her four-piece band, performing both jazz and R&B numbers, including many Jones Girls' tunes. She later moved to New York after her children were grown, to have a more active performing and recording schedule. On April 3, 2017, she was visiting her daughter in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and was hit by several cars and killed while attempting to cross the street.

Consisting of Brenda, [[Shirley Jones (R&B singer)|Shirley]] and Valorie Jones, The Jones Girls first signed and recorded for GM Records in 1970. The trio were best known for their singles during the late\u20131970s through the 1980s; most notably 1979's \"You Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else\". After a six\u2013year tenure with GM, they then recorded for [[Philadelphia International Records]] with [[Gamble & Huff]].\n\n==History==\nThe group consisted of sisters Brenda (December 7, 1954 \u2013 April 3, 2017),<ref>[http://www.pippinfuneralhome.com/notices/Brenda-Williams Brenda Jones Williams December 7, 1954 \u2013 April 3, 2017 (age 62)]</ref><ref>[https://newsone.com/3704182/brenda-jones-62-the-jones-girls-rip/ NewsOne - Brenda Jones 62, The Jones Girls - RIP - April 3, 2017]</ref> Valorie (April 17, 1956 \u2013 December 2, 2001) and [[Shirley Jones (R&B singer)|Shirley Jones]] (born 1953). They performed as backup singers for [[Lou Rawls]], [[Teddy Pendergrass]], [[Aretha Franklin]], and Le Pamplemousse. They worked with [[Diana Ross]] from 1975\u201378 and were the backup singers on [[Linda Clifford]]'s 1978 album ''[[If My Friends Could See Me Now (Linda Clifford album)|If My Friends Could See Me Now]]''. They also performed on [[Tower of Power]]'s disco-themed 1979 album ''[[Back on the Streets (Tower of Power album)|Back on the Streets]]''. Their biggest hit was \"You Gonna Make Me Love Somebody Else\". The song hit the [[Billboard Magazine]] Top 40 at number 38 in May 1979. The song was also a Top 5 R&B hit. It became a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]]. An additional hit followed in 1980, with the single \"I Just Love The Man\", charting at number 9 in January 1981. The less successful \"Nights Over Egypt\" (1981), written by [[Dexter Wansel]], charted at R&B #23 in 1982.\n\nAfter the release and failure of their fourth U.S. album, ''On Target'', lead singer Shirley Jones pursued a solo career and had a number 1 R&B hit on Billboard with \"[[Do You Get Enough Love]]\", from her top-ten debut album ''Always in the Mood'' (1986). \"Do You Get Enough Love\" was written by [[Bunny Sigler]] who also produced it with [[Kenny Gamble]].<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book of Number One Rhythm & Blues Hits|last=White |first=Adam |last2=Bronson |first2=Fred|authorlink2=Fred Bronson |year=1993 |publisher=Billboard Books:Watson-Guptill Publications, New York |page=368}}</ref> Valorie Jones died on December 2, 2001, in Detroit, Michigan, at the age of 45.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=7742025|title=Valorie Jones (1956 - 2001) - Find A Grave Memorial|website=Findagrave.com|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref> In 2007, Shirley Jones released an album ''Ladies Night Out'' together with [[Jean Carn]] and [[Cherrelle]], on CD and DVD.\n\nBrenda eventually moved to Atlanta, where she sang frequently with her four-piece band, performing both jazz and R&B numbers, including many Jones Girls' tunes. She later moved to New York after her children were grown, to have a more active performing and recording schedule.
