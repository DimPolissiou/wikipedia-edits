{"title_page": "Supernatural Horror in Literature", "text_new": "\"'''Supernatural Horror in Literature'''\" is a 28,000 word essay by American writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]], surveying the development and achievements of [[horror fiction]] as the field stood in the 1920s and 30s. The essay was researched and written between November 1925 and May 1927, first published in August 1927, and then revised and expanded during 1933\u20131934.\n\n==The essay==\nLovecraft's essay ranges widely, but he first examines the beginnings of [[weird fiction]] in the early [[gothic novel]]. As a guide for what to read in the early gothic he relied partly on [[Edith Birkhead]]'s 1921 historical survey ''The Tale of Terror'', and he was also able to draw on the expertise of the great many experts and collectors in his circle. The bulk of the essay was written in New York City and thus Lovecraft had access to the resources of the city's great public libraries and also to the collections of his friends, and thus he was able to read widely and obtain obscure and rare works.  His survey then proceeds to outline the development of the supernatural and the weird in the work of major writers such as [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. Lovecraft names as the four \"modern masters\" of horror: [[Algernon Blackwood]], [[Lord Dunsany]],  [[M. R. James]], and [[Arthur Machen]].  In addition to these masters, Lovecraft attempts to make the essay an encompassing survey, and thus he mentions or notes many others in passing. \n\n==Publication history==\nThe text was first published in August 1927 in the one-issue magazine ''The Recluse'', and copies were widely circulated.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Joshi, S.

The full revised text first became easily available to the public in ''The Outsider and Others'' (1939).\n\n==Critical reception==\n''An H. P.

Families in [[Wales]] traveled long distances begging for food. Famine was prevalent in north and southwest Ireland, following the failure of wheat, [[oat]], and potato harvests. In Germany, the crisis was severe; food prices rose sharply. With the cause of the problems unknown, people demonstrated in front of grain markets and bakeries, and later riots, arson, and [[looting]] took place in many European cities. It was the worst [[famine]] of 19th-century mainland Europe.<ref name=\"Oppenheimer2003\"/><ref>\"The 'year without a summer' in 1816 produced massive famines and helped stimulate the emergence of the administrative state\", observes [[Albert Gore]], ''Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the human spirit'', 2000:79</ref>\n\nThe effects were widespread and lasted beyond the winter. In western [[Switzerland]], the summers of 1816 and 1817 were so cold that an [[Proglacial lake|ice dam]] formed below a tongue of the [[Gi\u00e9tro Glacier]] high in the [[Val de Bagnes]]. Despite engineer [[Ignaz Venetz]]'s efforts to drain the growing lake, the ice dam collapsed catastrophically in June 1818, killing 40 people.<ref>The flood is fully described in Jean M.

The fog reddened and dimmed the sunlight, such that [[sunspot]]s were visible to the naked eye. Neither wind nor rainfall dispersed the \"fog\". It has been characterized as a \"stratospheric [[sulfate]] aerosol veil\".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1191/0309133303pp379ra | last1 = Oppenheimer | first1 = Clive | year = 2003 | title = Climatic, environmental and human consequences of the largest known historic eruption: Tambora volcano (Indonesia) 1815 | journal = [[Progress in Physical Geography]] | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 230\u2013259 }}</ref>\n\nThe weather was not in itself a hardship for those accustomed to long winters. The real problem lay in the weather's effect on crops and thus on the supply of food and firewood.

In May 1816,<ref name=\"islandnet1\"/> [[frost]] killed off most crops in the higher elevations of [[Massachusetts]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Vermont]], as well as [[upstate New York]].

Temperatures went below freezing almost every day in May. The ground froze on June 9. On June 12, the Shakers had to replant crops destroyed by the cold. On July 7, it was so cold, everything had stopped growing. The [[Berkshire Hills]] had frost again on August 23, as did much of the upper northeast.<!-- (MA, NH, VT, ME, upstate New York) --><ref>Nicholas Bennet, Domestic Journal, May\u2013September 1816, Western Reserve Historical Society ms. V:B-68, quoted in Wergland, One Shaker Life: Isaac Newton Youngs, 1793\u20131865, chapter 2.</ref>\n\nA Massachusetts historian summed up the disaster:\n\n<blockquote>Severe frosts occurred every month; June 7th and 8th snow fell, and it was so cold that crops were cut down, even freezing the roots ... In the early Autumn when corn was in the milk it was so thoroughly frozen that it never ripened and was scarcely worth harvesting. Breadstuffs were scarce and prices high and the poorer class of people were often in straits for want of food. It must be remembered that the granaries of the great west had not then been opened to us by railroad communication, and people were obliged to rely upon their own resources or upon others in their immediate locality.<ref>William G. Atkins, History of Hawley (West Cummington, Mass. (1887), 86.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn July and August, lake and river ice was observed as far south as northwestern [[Pennsylvania]]. Frost was reported as far south as [[Virginia]] on August 20 and 21.<ref>American Beacon (Norfolk, VA), September 9, 1816, 3.</ref> Rapid, dramatic temperature swings were common, with temperatures sometimes reverting from normal or above-normal summer temperatures as high as 95&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) to near-freezing within hours. [[Thomas Jefferson]], retired from the presidency and farming at [[Monticello]], sustained crop failures that sent him further into debt. On September 13, a Virginia newspaper reported that corn crops would be one half to two-thirds short and lamented that \"the cold as well as the drought has nipt the buds of hope\".<ref>\"Crops,\" American Beacon(Norfolk, VA), September 13, 1816, 3</ref> A [[Norfolk, Virginia]] newspaper reported: \n\n<blockquote>It is now the middle of July, and we have not yet had what could properly be called summer. Easterly winds have prevailed for nearly three months past ... the sun during that time has generally been obscured and the sky overcast with clouds; the air has been damp and uncomfortable, and frequently so chilling as to render the fireside a desirable retreat.<ref>Columbian Register(New Haven, CT), July 27, 1816, 2.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRegional farmers did succeed in bringing some crops to maturity, but [[maize|corn]] and other [[cereal|grain]] prices rose dramatically. The price of [[oats]], for example, rose from 12\u00a2 per [[bushel]] (${{#expr:12/3.523907017round1}}0/m<sup>3</sup>) in 1815 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.12|1815|r=2}}}} today) to 92\u00a2 per bushel (${{#expr:92/3.523907017round0}}/m<sup>3</sup>) in 1816 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.92|1816|r=2}}}} today). Crop failures were aggravated by an inadequate transportation network: with few roads or navigable inland waterways and no railroads, it was expensive to import food.<ref>John Luther Ringwalt, ''[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_tkcKAAAAIAAJ_3 Development of Transportation Systems in the United States]'', \"Commencement of the Turnpike and Bridge Era\", 1888:27 notes that the very first artificial road was the [[Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike]], 1792\u201395, a single route of 62 miles; \"it seems impossible to ascribe to the turnpike movement in the years before 1810 any significant improvement in the methods of land transportation in southern New England, or any considerable reduction in the cost of land carriage\" (Percy Wells Bidwell, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=frIWAQAAIAAJ Rural Economy in New England]\", in ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences'', '''20''' [1916:317]).</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}\nAs a result of the series of volcanic eruptions, crops in the aforementioned areas had been poor for several years; the final blow came in 1815 with the eruption of Tambora. Europe, still recuperating from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], suffered from food shortages. Food riots broke out in the United Kingdom and France, and grain warehouses were looted. The violence was worst in landlocked Switzerland, where [[famine]] caused the government to declare a national emergency. Huge storms and abnormal rainfall with flooding of Europe's major rivers (including the [[Rhine]]) are attributed to the event, as is the August frost. A major [[typhus]] epidemic occurred in Ireland between 1816 and 1819, precipitated by the famine caused by the Year Without a Summer. An estimated 100,000 Irish perished during this period. A BBC documentary, using figures compiled in Switzerland, estimated that the fatality rates in 1816 were twice that of average years, giving an approximate European fatality total of 200,000 deaths.\n\nNew England also experienced major consequences from the eruption of Tambora. The corn crop in New England failed. Corn was reported to have ripened so poorly that no more than a quarter of it was usable for food. The crop failures in New England, Canada, and parts of Europe also caused the price of wheat, grains, meat, vegetables, butter, milk, and flour to rise sharply.\n\nThe eruption of Tambora caused [[Hungary]] to experience brown snow. Italy's northern and north-central region experienced something similar, with red snow falling throughout the year. The cause of this is believed to have been volcanic ash in the atmosphere.\n\nIn China, unusually low temperatures in summer and fall devastated rice production in [[Yunnan]], resulting in widespread famine.

The price of [[oats]], for example, rose from 12\u00a2 per [[bushel]] (${{#expr:12/3.523907017round1}}0/m<sup>3</sup>) in 1815 (equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.12|1815|r=2}}}} today) to 92\u00a2 per bushel (${{#expr:92/3.523907017round0}}/m<sup>3</sup>) in 1816 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|0.92|1816|r=2}}}} today). Crop failures were aggravated by an inadequate transportation network: with few roads or navigable inland waterways and no railroads, it was expensive to import food.<ref>John Luther Ringwalt, ''[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_tkcKAAAAIAAJ_3 Development of Transportation Systems in the United States]'', \"Commencement of the Turnpike and Bridge Era\", 1888:27 notes that the very first artificial road was the [[Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike]], 1792\u201395, a single route of 62 miles; \"it seems impossible to ascribe to the turnpike movement in the years before 1810 any significant improvement in the methods of land transportation in southern New England, or any considerable reduction in the cost of land carriage\" (Percy Wells Bidwell, \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=frIWAQAAIAAJ Rural Economy in New England]\", in ''Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences'', '''20''' [1916:317]).</ref>\n\n==Effects==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}\nAs a result of the series of volcanic eruptions, crops in the aforementioned areas had been poor for several years; the final blow came in 1815 with the eruption of Tambora. Europe, still recuperating from the [[Napoleonic Wars]], suffered from food shortages. Food riots broke out in the United Kingdom and France, and grain warehouses were looted. The violence was worst in landlocked Switzerland, where [[famine]] caused the government to declare a national emergency. Huge storms and abnormal rainfall with flooding of Europe's major rivers (including the [[Rhine]]) are attributed to the event, as is the August frost. A major [[typhus]] epidemic occurred in Ireland between 1816 and 1819, precipitated by the famine caused by the Year Without a Summer. An estimated 100,000 Irish perished during this period. A BBC documentary, using figures compiled in Switzerland, estimated that the fatality rates in 1816 were twice that of average years, giving an approximate European fatality total of 200,000 deaths.\n\nNew England also experienced major consequences from the eruption of Tambora. The corn crop in New England failed. Corn was reported to have ripened so poorly that no more than a quarter of it was usable for food. The crop failures in New England, Canada, and parts of Europe also caused the price of wheat, grains, meat, vegetables, butter, milk, and flour to rise sharply.\n\nThe eruption of Tambora caused [[Hungary]] to experience brown snow. Italy's northern and north-central region experienced something similar, with red snow falling throughout the year. The cause of this is believed to have been volcanic ash in the atmosphere.\n\nIn China, unusually low temperatures in summer and fall devastated rice production in [[Yunnan]], resulting in widespread famine. Fort [[Shuangcheng]], now in [[Heilongjiang]], reported fields disrupted by frost and conscripts deserting as a result. Summer snowfall or otherwise [[mixed precipitation]] was reported in various locations in [[Jiangxi]] and [[Anhui]], located at around 30\u00b0N. In [[Taiwan]], which has a tropical climate, snow was reported in [[Hsinchu]] and [[Miaoli County|Miaoli]], and frost was reported in [[Changhua]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090326133019/http://www.igsnrr.ac.cn/lwzzImg/1161151232919.pdf Serious Famine in Yunnan (1815\u20131817) and the Eruption of Tambola Volcano] Fudan Journal (Social Sciences) No. 1 2005, archived on March 26, 2009 from [http://www.igsnrr.ac.cn/lwzzImg/1161151232919.pdf the original]</ref>\n\n===Cultural effects===\nHigh levels of [[tephra]] in the atmosphere led to unusually spectacular sunsets during this period, a feature celebrated in the paintings of [[J.

Similar phenomena were observed after the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], and on the [[West Coast of the United States]] following the [[1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo]] in the Philippines.\n\nThe lack of oats to feed horses may have inspired the German inventor [[Karl Drais]] to research new ways of horseless transportation, which led to the invention of the [[draisine]] or [[velocipede]].

Also in 1882, the [[California Southern Railroad]], a subsidiary of the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]] completed construction of the section from [[National City, California|National City]] to Temecula. In 1883, the line was extended to [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]]. In the late 1880s, a series of floods washed out the tracks and the section of the railroad through the canyon was finally abandoned. The old Temecula station was used as a barn and later demolished.\n\nIn the 1890s, with the operation of [[granite]] stone quarries, Temecula granite was shaped into fence and hitching posts, curb stones, courthouse steps, and building blocks. At the turn of the 20th century, Temecula became an important shipping point for grain and cattle.\n\n===1900\u20131989===\n[[File:Temecula-1909.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Temecula, 1909.]]\nIn 1904 Walter L.

Vail bought ranchland in the Temecula Valley, buying {{convert|38000|acre|km2|0}} of Rancho Temecula and Rancho Pauba, along with the northern half of Rancho Little Temecula. Vail was killed by a street car in Los Angeles in 1906; his son, Mahlon Vail, took over the family ranch. In 1914, financed by Mahlon Vail and local ranchers, the First National Bank of Temecula opened on Front Street. In 1915, the first paved, two-lane county road was built through Temecula.\n\nBy 1947, the Vail Ranch contained over {{convert|87500|acre|km2|0}}. In 1948, the Vail family built a dam to catch the [[Temecula Creek]] water and created [[Vail Lake]]. Through the mid-1960s, the economy of the Temecula Valley centered around the Vail Ranch; the cattle business and agriculture were the stimuli for most business ventures. In 1964, the Vail Ranch was sold to the [[Kaiser Aluminum|Kaiser]] [[Aetna]] partnership. A later purchase by the group brought the total area to {{convert|97500|acre|km2|0}}, and the area became known as Rancho California. The I-15 corridor between the [[Greater Los Angeles]] area and San Diego was completed in the early 1980s, and the subdivision land boom began.\n\n===1990\u2013present===\nThe 1990s brought rapid growth to the Temecula Valley.

The old Temecula station was used as a barn and later demolished.\n\nIn the 1890s, with the operation of [[granite]] stone quarries, Temecula granite was shaped into fence and hitching posts, curb stones, courthouse steps, and building blocks. At the turn of the 20th century, Temecula became an important shipping point for grain and cattle.\n\n===1900\u20131989===\n[[File:Temecula-1909.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Temecula, 1909.]]\nIn 1904 Walter L. Vail, who had come to the United States with his parents from [[Nova Scotia]], migrated to California. Along with various partners, he began buying land in Southern California. Vail bought ranchland in the Temecula Valley, buying {{convert|38000|acre|km2|0}} of Rancho Temecula and Rancho Pauba, along with the northern half of Rancho Little Temecula. Vail was killed by a street car in Los Angeles in 1906; his son, Mahlon Vail, took over the family ranch. In 1914, financed by Mahlon Vail and local ranchers, the First National Bank of Temecula opened on Front Street. In 1915, the first paved, two-lane county road was built through Temecula.\n\nBy 1947, the Vail Ranch contained over {{convert|87500|acre|km2|0}}. In 1948, the Vail family built a dam to catch the [[Temecula Creek]] water and created [[Vail Lake]]. Through the mid-1960s, the economy of the Temecula Valley centered around the Vail Ranch; the cattle business and agriculture were the stimuli for most business ventures. In 1964, the Vail Ranch was sold to the [[Kaiser Aluminum|Kaiser]] [[Aetna]] partnership. A later purchase by the group brought the total area to {{convert|97500|acre|km2|0}}, and the area became known as Rancho California. The I-15 corridor between the [[Greater Los Angeles]] area and San Diego was completed in the early 1980s, and the subdivision land boom began.\n\n===1990\u2013present===\nThe 1990s brought rapid growth to the Temecula Valley. Many families began moving to the area from San Diego, Los Angeles, and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], drawn by the affordable housing prices and the popular wine country.

After a period of rapid population growth and home construction, the [[2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]] and the resultant [[United States housing market correction]] caused a sharp rise in home [[foreclosure]]s in the Temecula-Murrieta region.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|37.28|sqmi|km2|1}}, of which {{convert|37.27|sqmi|km2|1}} of it is land and {{convert|0.012|sqmi|km2|3}} of it (0.03%) is water.

{"title_page": "Idler-wheel", "text_new": "{{for|the Fiona Apple album|The Idler Wheel...}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}\n\nAn '''idler-wheel''' is a wheel which serves only to transmit rotation from one shaft to another, in applications where it is undesirable to connect them directly.  For example, connecting a motor to the platter of a [[phonograph]], or the crankshaft-to-camshaft gear train of an automobile.\n\nBecause it does no work itself, it is called an \"[[wikt:idler|idler]]\".\n\n==Friction drive==\nAn idler-wheel may be used as part of a [[friction drive]] mechanism.  For example, to connect a metal motor shaft to a metal platter without gear noise, early phonographs used a rubber idler wheel.\n\nLikewise, the pinch roller in a magnetic [[tape transport]] is a type of idler wheel, which presses against the driven capstan to increase friction.\n\n==Idler pulley==\nIn a [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]] drive system, idlers are often used to alter the path of the belt, where a direct path would be impractical.\n\nIdler pulleys are also often used to press against the ''back'' of a pulley in order to increase the wrap angle (and thus contact area) of a belt against the working pulleys, increasing the force-transfer capacity.\n\nBelt drive systems commonly incorporate one movable pulley which is spring- or gravity-loaded to act as a [[belt tensioner]], to accommodate stretching of the belt due to temperature or wear.  An idler wheel is usually used for this purpose, on order to avoid having to move the power-transfer shafts.\n\n==Idler gear==\n[[File:Gears large.jpg|thumb|Gears in a machine. The middle, medium-sized gear is an idler gear.|alt=Part of a machine with three gears connected to one another.]]\nAn idler gear is a gear wheel that is inserted between two or more other gear wheels. The purpose of an idler gear can be two-fold. Firstly, the idler gear will change the direction of rotation of the output shaft. Secondly, an idler gear can assist to reduce the size of the input/output gears whilst maintaining the spacing of the shafts.\n\n===Gear ratio===\nAn idler gear does not affect the [[gear ratio]] between the input and output shafts. Note that in a sequence of gears chained together, the ratio depends only on the number of teeth on the first and last gear. The intermediate gears, regardless of their size, do not alter the overall gear ratio of the chain, except to change the direction of rotation of the final gear.  (That is, each intermediate gear changes the [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] of the gear ratio.)\n\nLikewise, the size of an idler wheel in a non-geared friction drive system does not affect the gear ratio between the input and output shafts. The surface speed of the input shaft is transferred directly to the surface speed of the idler wheel, and then from the idler wheel to the output shaft. A larger or smaller idler wheel maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input shaft), therefore the output shaft is driven at a constant speed regardless of the size of the idler wheel (unless of course there is slippage, which should not occur in most friction drive systems when operating correctly; however, there are instances where an idler wheel can double as a clutch, or if there is a sudden or unusually heavy load on the system. These situations can cause the ratio of rotations between the wheels to vary, unlike a gear system, which will always rotate at a certain rate unless something is very wrong and the gears starts skipping teeth, or teeth are broken off).\n\n===Applications===\n;Reversing\nAn intermediate gear which does not drive a shaft to perform any work is called an idler gear. Sometimes, a single idler gear is used to reverse the direction, in which case it may be referred to as a reverse idler. For instance, the typical [[automobile]] [[manual transmission]] engages reverse gear by means of inserting a reverse idler between two gears. Since a driven gear (gear \"A\") rotating clockwise will drive a second gear (\"B\") counterclockwise, adding a third gear to the string means that gear \"C\" will be spinning the same direction as \"A\". A typical transmission is designed with \"A\" and \"B\" gears, so when the engine spins, the outputs shaft spins the ''opposite'' direction, which drives the vehicle ''forward''. A reverse idler gear setup is actually typically an \"A\" and a \"C\" gear, which are not in contact with each other until a \"B\" gear is moved between them. Since the transmission is designed to move the car ''forwards'' when the output is spinning in the ''opposite'' direction from the input shaft, when added to the \"B\" idler gear, it forces the \"C\" gear to spin in the same direction as the \"A\" gear, and thus the input and output shafts are spinning in the same direction, which drives the car in reverse.\n\nAnother scenario is a series of rollers, such as used for pressing paper. Each roller has to be powered, but adding a motor to each one is wasteful (and it can be difficult to synchronize rotational speed with independent drive systems). One could simply add a gear onto the end of the shaft of each roller, but that means that each roller would be spinning the opposite direction of the one before (and therefore rubbing against each other as the turn). By simply adding a small idler gear between each larger gear, the result is a series of rollers, all being powered in the same direction.\n\n;Transmission over distance\nIdler gears can also transmit rotation among distant shafts in situations where it would be impractical to simply make the distant gears larger to bring them together. Not only do larger gears occupy more space, but the mass and rotational inertia ([[moment of inertia]]) of a gear is [[quadratic function|quadratic]] in proportion to its [[radius]]. Instead of idler gears, of course, a [[toothed belt]] or a [[roller chain]] can be used to transmit torque over distance. For short distances, a train of idlers may be used; whether an odd or even number is used determines whether the final output gear rotates the same direction as the input gear or not. For longer distances, a roller chain or belt is quieter and creates less friction, although gears are typically stronger, depending on the strength of the roller chain. A case where numerous idler gears might be used is as described above, where there are a number of output gears that need to be driven simultaneously.\n\n[[Continuous track|'''Caterpillar track''']] '''idler wheels'''\n\nA tracked vehicle uses a combination of wheels and rollers, including [[Sprocket|''drive sprockets'']], ''idler wheels'', ''track return rollers'' and ''road wheels''. It is quite similar in concept to a [[conveyor belt]], only instead of a machine carrying objects on top of a powered continuous belt, it's a machine that moves itself over a continuous belt. In a typical application, power is transmitted to a [[Sprocket|''drive sprocket'']] (or drive wheel), which drives the track around its loop. On the opposite end of the vehicle, there is an ''idler wheel'', which provides a [[pulley|pulley wheel]]  of sorts. On some applications, the drive sprocket and idler wheel carry some of the weight of the vehicle, for the purposes of this description, we will assume the drive sprocket and idler wheel are not weight-bearing units, and the drive sprocket is on the front (see [[M4 Sherman]] for an example). Since the drive sprocket can be at either the front (M4 Sherman, many other WWII tanks) or the rear ([[T-90]], most modern tanks) of the vehicle depending on the design, the idler wheel either carries the track back off the ground and returns it to the drive sprocket (rear idler wheel), or receives track from the drive sprocket and lays it down in front of the road wheels (front idler wheel). The idler wheel is not powered, just like an idler gear. Although it technically reverses the tracks direction (but not its ''rotation''), this has nothing to do with the term \"idler\"; it is not related to an idler gear other than that they are both \"idle\", or not doing any work, only transmitting power (\"idle\" being a term for something or someone who isn't working). The ''road wheels'' are a series of non-powered wheels between the drive sprocket and idler wheel that serve to support the weight of the vehicle (and thus aren't considered \"idle\", even though they are unpowered). In higher speed applications, such as tanks and other AFV's, these road wheels are typically given some sort of suspension system to ease the ride, increase controllability, and decrease wear and tear. Due to the complications in adding suspension systems to the idler wheel and, in particular, the drive sprocket, in such vehicles, the road wheels typically carry all of the weight of the vehicle. In low speed applications, such as bulldozers, these road wheels lack any kind of suspension system, as the low speeds don't demand the cushioning. This also allows the idler and drive wheels to carry some of the weight, as their lack of suspension is made irrelevant. ''Track return rollers'' may or may not be used, and are simply small rollers which support the weight of the track as it's transferred from rear to front to be laid down again.The track simply provides a solid \"road\" for the road wheels to roll over on over all surfaces: the road wheels roll the vehicle along the self-created \"road\", while the drive sprocket forces the vehicle forward along the track and lays down \"fresh\" track. The idler picks the \"used\" track back up, and returns it back to the drive sprocket in the front. This is why an early term for a tracked vehicle was a \"track-laying machine\" (not to be confused with [[Track (rail transport)|railroad track]] laying equipment). Transporting vehicles over muddy ground often required planks or logs to be placed along the track (see [[corduroy road]], [[plank road]]). In the later 19th century, inventors figured out a way to make a rolling machine that would lay its own plank road wherever it went, negating the need for farmers to lay down logs in order to traverse muddy areas. Other benefits were discovered later.\n\nNote that there are some non-powered tracked transports (i.e. [[Trailer (vehicle)|trailers]] that roll on tracks rather than wheels), which have two idler wheels rather than a drive sprocket. There are also certain pieces of equipment, such as the [[Caterpillar D9]] bulldozer (and numerous other Caterpillar brand bulldozers), [[Tucker Sno-Cat|Tucker Sno-cat]] and [[Mattracks Inc.|Mattracks]] rubber track conversion kits, which configure their tracks in the shape of a triangle, or pyramid (when viewed from the side), with the drive sprocket at the tip of the pyramid. In this configuration, there are two idler/roadwheels and one drive sprocket (as well as a number of small, load-bearing roadwheels). In very rare cases, the vehicle lacks an idler wheel at all; in Northern regions, one way people got better traction in deep snow was to take a simple three-[[axle]] truck, and install a simple continuous track around the rear wheels, thus forming a basic [[half-track]] system which featured two drive wheels, and no idler or road wheels. One almost never sees this on true tracked vehicles, however, as the second drive wheel is redundant.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n[[Category:Mechanical engineering]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the Fiona Apple album|The Idler Wheel...}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2015}}\n\nAn '''idler-wheel''' is wheel which serves only to transmit rotation from one shaft to another, in applications where it is undesirable to connect them directly.
