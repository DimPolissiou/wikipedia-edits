Rather than selling dogs, cats, rabbits, and other larger animals in the store, PetSmart donates space to local rescue groups.  Rescue groups are also provided with donations of food, litter, and other supplies. Fees from adoptions are collected by the groups themselves.  With each adoption, PetSmart gives the new guardians a book which provides basic care information for their new pet.  As of September 22, 2016, over 7,000,000 pets have been adopted through Petsmart adoption centers.  Biannually, PetSmart hosts an adoption weekend featuring more adoptable pets than at any other time of the year.\n\nThe majority of PetSmart stores consist of a cat adoption center.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.petsmartcharities.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-centers|title=Adoption Centers Bring Cute Pets to Your Neighborhood|work=PetSmart Charities|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[PetSmart Charities]], a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, also raises money for local adoption groups, including groups for which it does not offer in-store space.  In many stores, donations are collected at the register via traditional drop boxes. Some stores also ask customers if they wish to donate a dollar at the register when they use a credit or debit card.  PetSmart charities also has an annual donation drive. Proceeds from Petsmart Charities events are given to over 3,400 adoption partners. PetSmart Charities claims that of the six to eight million pets collected by rescue agencies, three to four million are euthanized simply because they do not have a loving home.\n\nPetSmart Charities Inc. is set to award the Austin Humane Society the first of three grant installments totaling $227,000 to assist in funding AHS's new Feral Cat Spay/Neuter Program.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2007/02/19/daily8.html \"Austin's Humane Society nets PetSmart grant\"; ''Austin Business Journal''; February 19, 2007]</ref>\n\nPetSmart Charities is also known for its Rescue Waggin' program.  The program operates specially-designed trucks that transport adoptable dogs from areas that are overpopulated to partner shelters where adoptable animals are in demand.  Rescue Waggin' operates trucks in the Midwest and the Northeast regions of the United States.  The program has saved more than 10,000 pets since 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petsmartcharities.org/press-releases/petsmart-charities-commits-up-to-1-million-to-support-hurricane-dorian-relief-efforts|title=PetSmart Charities\u00ae Commits Up To $1 Million to Support Hurricane Dorian Relief Efforts {{!}} PetSmart Charities|website=petsmartcharities.org|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\nPetSmart also operated an online Pet Parent community at [[Pets.com]].\n\n==Allegations by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals==\nPetSmart has been the subject of public criticism by animal rights organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] for the company's sale of live birds.  PETA alleges that it is cruel to sell birds bred in warehouses and feels that the breeding of the birds is similar to the use of [[puppy mills]]. PETA renewed its demands that PetSmart permanently stop selling live birds after the voluntary halt in bird sales because of the [[psittacosis]] outbreak in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.peta.org/archives/2008/01/petsmart_suspen.php |title=PetSmart Suspends All Bird Sales Following Outbreak |publisher=Blog.peta.org |date= |accessdate=January 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nPETA also claims that the use of pest control glue traps within PetSmart stores is cruel.  PETA feels that because the stores sell various species of [[rodents]], that it is hypocritical for them to engage in rodent pest control. PetSmart counters that it is unfair to characterize its bird breeders as similar to puppy mills since these operations must meet the company's veterinarian established and industry leading standards for the breeding, care and transportation of these pets. Also, small pets sold in the stores are bred to be pets and should not be confused with wild rodents, which carry disease and are destructive to property. It maintains that essentially all major retailers, restaurants, and grocers with rodent control programs effectively use glue traps.\n\nOn January 23, 2008, PETA posted a press release accusing one of Petsmart's largest vendors, Rainbow World Exotics, of neglect and cruelty to animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/mc/NewsItem.asp?id=10841 |title=Rainbow World Exotics Expose by PETA |publisher=Peta.org |date= |accessdate=January 21, 2012}}</ref> Videotape provided by an undercover PETA member who infiltrated the facility as an employee shows small animals treated cruelly and neglected.  The more serious allegations included laypersons (not vets) neutering animals with unsafe provisions, live animals thrown in the trash, loose animals killed intentionally, and sick animals killed or left to die with no veterinarian interaction attempted.  After these allegations PetSmart launched an investigation which reported discovering no serious wrongdoing by Rainbow, although they agreed that a neutering which was videotaped did not meet their or veterinary standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=196265&p=factset03 |title=PetSmart's Investigation of Rainbow Exotics |publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net |date= |accessdate=January 21, 2012}}</ref> PETA is filing complaints with the [[USDA]] and pursuing criminal charges with the county of [[Hamilton, Texas]], where Rainbow World exotics is located.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.peta.org/|title=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)|website=PETA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://features.peta2.com/pettrade/learn-more.asp|title=Behind the Scenes in the Pet Trade {{!}} Investigation Details {{!}} peta2.com|website=features.peta2.com|access-date=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2016, PETA released details of an investigation of Holmes Farm, a major supplier of live animals to Petsmart, [[Petco]] and [[Pet Supplies Plus]], which highlighted abusive conditions at what is described as a complex of \"filthy, windowless warehouses.\" Small animals such as rabbits, hamsters, rats, mice and gerbils were confined to overcrowded bins and often drank from contaminated water bowls or had no water altogether. Cats, who freely roamed around the facilities, regularly jumped in and out of bins and preyed on the animals within them. PETA's investigators reported that, during their observations, injured animals never received veterinary care, but instead were piled by the dozens in \"feces-smeared coolers\" and then gassed to death with carbon monoxide; others were put into ziplock bags and frozen to death. Over the span of roughly three months, PETA\u2019s investigator found hundreds of dead animals at the complex, often in habitats which contained no drinking water.<ref>[http://investigations.peta.org/animals-gassed-frozen-petco-petsmart/ Animals Frozen Alive, Crudely Gassed at Petco, PetSmart Supplier Mill]. PETA, January 19, 2016.</ref>\n\nIn February 2016, another PETA investigation discovered rampant abuse and neglect at Mack, an Ohio reptile mill and a supplier for Petsmart, including, among other things, frogs, lizards, turtles and other animals being \"crammed into filthy, crowded plastic bins stacked into shelving units like old bank statements.

Rather than selling dogs, cats, rabbits, and other larger animals in the store, PetSmart donates space to local rescue groups.  Rescue groups are also provided with donations of food, litter, and other supplies. Fees from adoptions are collected by the groups themselves.  With each adoption, PetSmart gives the new guardians a book which provides basic care information for their new pet.  As of September 22, 2016, over 7,000,000 pets have been adopted through Petsmart adoption centers.  Biannually, PetSmart hosts an adoption weekend featuring more adoptable pets than at any other time of the year.\n\nThe majority of PetSmart stores consist of a cat adoption center.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.petsmartcharities.org/adopt-a-pet/adoption-centers|title=Adoption Centers Bring Cute Pets to Your Neighborhood|work=PetSmart Charities|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[PetSmart Charities]], a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization, also raises money for local adoption groups, including groups for which it does not offer in-store space.  In many stores, donations are collected at the register via traditional drop boxes. Some stores also ask customers if they wish to donate a dollar at the register when they use a credit or debit card.  PetSmart charities also has an annual donation drive. Proceeds from Petsmart Charities events are given to over 3,400 adoption partners. PetSmart Charities claims that of the six to eight million pets collected by rescue agencies, three to four million are euthanized simply because they do not have a loving home.\n\nPetSmart Charities Inc. is set to award the Austin Humane Society the first of three grant installments totaling $227,000 to assist in funding AHS's new Feral Cat Spay/Neuter Program.<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2007/02/19/daily8.html \"Austin's Humane Society nets PetSmart grant\"; ''Austin Business Journal''; February 19, 2007]</ref>\n\nPetSmart Charities is also known for its Rescue Waggin' program.  The program operates specially-designed trucks that transport adoptable dogs from areas that are overpopulated to partner shelters where adoptable animals are in demand.  Rescue Waggin' operates trucks in the Midwest and the Northeast regions of the United States.  The program has saved more than 10,000 pets since 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petsmartcharities.org/press-releases/petsmart-charities-commits-up-to-1-million-to-support-hurricane-dorian-relief-efforts|title=PetSmart Charities\u00ae Commits Up To $1 Million to Support Hurricane Dorian Relief Efforts {{!}} PetSmart Charities|website=petsmartcharities.org|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref>\n\nPetSmart also operated an online Pet Parent community at [[Pets.com]].\n\n==Allegations by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals==\nPetSmart has been the subject of public criticism by animal rights organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] for the company's sale of live birds.  PETA alleges that it is cruel to sell birds bred in warehouses and feels that the breeding of the birds is similar to the use of [[puppy mills]]. PETA renewed its demands that PetSmart permanently stop selling live birds after the voluntary halt in bird sales because of the [[psittacosis]] outbreak in January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.peta.org/archives/2008/01/petsmart_suspen.php |title=PetSmart Suspends All Bird Sales Following Outbreak |publisher=Blog.peta.org |date= |accessdate=January 21, 2012}}</ref>\n\nPETA also claims that the use of pest control glue traps within PetSmart stores is cruel.  PETA feels that because the stores sell various species of [[rodents]], that it is hypocritical for them to engage in rodent pest control. PetSmart counters that it is unfair to characterize its bird breeders as similar to puppy mills since these operations must meet the company's veterinarian established and industry leading standards for the breeding, care and transportation of these pets. Also, small pets sold in the stores are bred to be pets and should not be confused with wild rodents, which carry disease and are destructive to property. It maintains that essentially all major retailers, restaurants, and grocers with rodent control programs effectively use glue traps.\n\nOn January 23, 2008, PETA posted a press release accusing one of Petsmart's largest vendors, Rainbow World Exotics, of neglect and cruelty to animals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/mc/NewsItem.asp?id=10841 |title=Rainbow World Exotics Expose by PETA |publisher=Peta.org |date= |accessdate=January 21, 2012}}</ref> Videotape provided by an undercover PETA member who infiltrated the facility as an employee shows small animals treated cruelly and neglected.  The more serious allegations included laypersons (not vets) neutering animals with unsafe provisions, live animals thrown in the trash, loose animals killed intentionally, and sick animals killed or left to die with no veterinarian interaction attempted.  After these allegations PetSmart launched an investigation which reported discovering no serious wrongdoing by Rainbow, although they agreed that a neutering which was videotaped did not meet their or veterinary standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=196265&p=factset03 |title=PetSmart's Investigation of Rainbow Exotics |publisher=Phx.corporate-ir.net |date= |accessdate=January 21, 2012}}</ref> PETA is filing complaints with the [[USDA]] and pursuing criminal charges with the county of [[Hamilton, Texas]], where Rainbow World exotics is located.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.peta.org/|title=People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)|website=PETA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://features.peta2.com/pettrade/learn-more.asp|title=Behind the Scenes in the Pet Trade {{!}} Investigation Details {{!}} peta2.com|website=features.peta2.com|access-date=2018-10-06}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2016, PETA released details of an investigation of Holmes Farm, a major supplier of live animals to Petsmart, [[Petco]] and [[Pet Supplies Plus]], which highlighted abusive conditions at what is described as a complex of \"filthy, windowless warehouses.\" Small animals such as rabbits, hamsters, rats, mice and gerbils were confined to overcrowded bins and often drank from contaminated water bowls or had no water altogether. Cats, who freely roamed around the facilities, regularly jumped in and out of bins and preyed on the animals within them. PETA's investigators reported that, during their observations, injured animals never received veterinary care, but instead were piled by the dozens in \"feces-smeared coolers\" and then gassed to death with carbon monoxide; others were put into ziplock bags and frozen to death. Over the span of roughly three months, PETA\u2019s investigator found hundreds of dead animals at the complex, often in habitats which contained no drinking water.<ref>[http://investigations.peta.org/animals-gassed-frozen-petco-petsmart/ Animals Frozen Alive, Crudely Gassed at Petco, PetSmart Supplier Mill].

The main subject of his works are Greek characters and the illustration of Greek traditional folklife and history.\n\n==Life and work==\nThe exact birthdate of Theophilos is unknown. However, it is believed that he was born between 1867 and 1870 in Vareia (\u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac), a village outside of [[Mytilene]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]). His father, Gabriil{{typo help inline|reason=similar to Gabriel|date=April 2020}} Kefalas, was a shoemaker, while his mother Pinelopi Hatzimihail was a daughter of an [[iconographer]]. When he was very young he was mediocre at school, but he had a special interest in [[painting]], having learned the basics from his grandfather.\n\nHis life was very hard, partially because people made fun of him since he often wore the traditional Greek kilt, the [[fustanella]], in public. At the age of 18 he abandoned his home and family and worked as a gate-keeper (\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, ''kavasis'') at the Greek consulate in [[Smyrna]].\n\nHe stayed in Smyrna for a few years before he settled in the city of [[Volos]] in about 1897, searching for occasional work and painting in houses and shops of the area. Many of his murals exist today. Most of his years he spent in [[Pelion|Ano Volos]]. His protector during that period was the landholder [[Giannis Kontos]], for whom he did many works. Today the house of Kontos is the Theophilos Museum. As well as painting, he was also involved in organizing popular theatrical acts for national ceremonies, and in the carnival period he had a major role, sometimes dressing as [[Alexander the Great]], with pupils in [[Macedonian phalanx]] formation, and sometimes as a hero of the [[Greek Revolution]], with gear and costumes made by himself.\n\nIn 1927 he returned to [[Mytilene]]. Legend states that he left [[Volos]] because of an incident in a ''kafeneio'' ([[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]) where someone played a joke on him in front of others and threw him down from a ladder where he was painting.\n\nIn [[Mytilene]], despite the mockery of the people, he continued to draw, painting many murals in villages for little payment, usually for a plate of food and a cup of wine.<ref>In the novella [[Vasilis Arvanitis]], [[Stratis Myrivilis]] describes a coffee house near the Karini spring in Lesbos as famous because \u201cits walls, inside and out, are covered with pictures and designs by the painter Theophilos.\u201d Of Theophilos himself he writes: \u201cHe was a strange man and people thought him half crazy.\u201d (Stratis Myrivilis, ''Vasilis Arvanitis'', translated into English by Pavlos Andronikos [Armidale: University of New England Publishing Unit, 1983], pp. 51-2.)</ref> Many of his works of this period have been lost, either due to natural aging or from damage by the owners.\n\nIn Mytilene, the renowned art critic and publisher Stratis Eletheriadis ([[T\u00e9riade]]), who lived in Paris, discovered Theophilos and brought him a great deal of recognition and also international publicity, though posthumous.

The main subject of his works are Greek characters and the illustration of Greek traditional folklife and history.\n\n==Life and work==\nThe exact birthdate of Theophilos is unknown. However, it is believed that he was born between 1867 and 1870 in Vareia (\u0392\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9\u03ac), a village outside of [[Mytilene]] (then part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]). His father, Gabriil Kefalas, was a shoemaker, while his mother Pinelopi Hatzimihail was a daughter of an [[iconographer]]. When he was very young he was mediocre at school, but he had a special interest in [[painting]], having learned the basics from his grandfather.\n\nHis life was very hard, partially because people made fun of him since he often wore the traditional Greek kilt, the [[fustanella]], in public. At the age of 18 he abandoned his home and family and worked as a gate-keeper (\u03ba\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, ''kavasis'') at the Greek consulate in [[Smyrna]].\n\nHe stayed in Smyrna for a few years before he settled in the city of [[Volos]] in about 1897, searching for occasional work and painting in houses and shops of the area. Many of his murals exist today. Most of his years he spent in [[Pelion|Ano Volos]]. His protector during that period was the landholder [[Giannis Kontos]], for whom he did many works. Today the house of Kontos is the Theophilos Museum. As well as painting, he was also involved in organizing popular theatrical acts for national ceremonies, and in the carnival period he had a major role, sometimes dressing as [[Alexander the Great]], with pupils in [[Macedonian phalanx]] formation, and sometimes as a hero of the [[Greek Revolution]], with gear and costumes made by himself.\n\nIn 1927 he returned to [[Mytilene]]. Legend states that he left [[Volos]] because of an incident in a ''kafeneio'' ([[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]) where someone played a joke on him in front of others and threw him down from a ladder where he was painting.\n\nIn [[Mytilene]], despite the mockery of the people, he continued to draw, painting many murals in villages for little payment, usually for a plate of food and a cup of wine.<ref>In the novella [[Vasilis Arvanitis]], [[Stratis Myrivilis]] describes a coffee house near the Karini spring in Lesbos as famous because \u201cits walls, inside and out, are covered with pictures and designs by the painter Theophilos.\u201d Of Theophilos himself he writes: \u201cHe was a strange man and people thought him half crazy.\u201d (Stratis Myrivilis, ''Vasilis Arvanitis'', translated into English by Pavlos Andronikos [Armidale: University of New England Publishing Unit, 1983], pp. 51-2.)</ref> Many of his works of this period have been lost, either due to natural aging or from damage by the owners.\n\nIn Mytilene, the renowned art critic and publisher Stratis Eletheriadis ([[T\u00e9riade]]), who lived in Paris, discovered Theophilos and brought him a great deal of recognition and also international publicity, though posthumous. With T\u00e9riade's funding in 1964 the Museum of Theophilos was constructed in Vareia, Lesbos.\n\nTheophilos died in March 1934, on the eve of the Annunciation, perhaps from food poisoning. One year later, his works were exhibited in the [[Louvre]] as a sample of a genuine folk painter of [[Greece]].\n\n==In popular culture==\n*{{cine.gr|\u03c4\u03af\u03c4\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2=\u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2|id=650979}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<Center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Erotokritos and Arethousa.jpg|''Erotokritos and Arethousa''\nFile:Theofilos Athena and Artemis.jpg|''Athena and Artemis''\nFile:Theofilos Eudoxia.jpg|''Symposium of Empress Eudoxia''\nFile:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|''Constantine Palaiologos''\nFile:Theophilos Chatzimichail - Alexander the Great, about 1900 - Athens, National Historical Museum.jpg|Alexander the Great\nFile:Theofilos Thiseas.jpg|Theseus\n</gallery>\n</Center>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*[[Yannis Tsarouchis]], ''Theophilos'' (Athens: The Commercial Bank of Greece, 1966).\n*[[Odysseas Elytis]], ''The Painter Theophilos'', pub.

More importantly for several notables removed from this list, CofO was merely a high school before 1956, and a junior college from 1956-65; thus any college-level classes taken at \"College of the Ozarks\" before 1956, or four-year or higher classes before 1965, must have been at UofO and *NOT* CofO.\n-->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://cofo.edu/}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Colleges and universities in Missouri}}\n{{Presbyterian Colleges}}\n{{CCCU}}\n{{Work Colleges Consortium}}\n{{NCCAA Division I Central navbox}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:College Of The Ozarks}}\n[[Category:College of the Ozarks| ]]\n[[Category:Education in Taney County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Liberal arts colleges in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1906]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Taney County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:1906 establishments in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA)]]\n[[Category:Work colleges]]\n[[Category:Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]\n[[Category:Bible colleges in Missouri]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the college in Missouri|the university in Arkansas known as College of the Ozarks from 1920-87|University of the Ozarks}}\n{{short description|Liberal-arts college in Point Lookout, Missouri}}\n{{Infobox university\n| name = College of the Ozarks\n| native_name = \n| latin_name = \n| image = Collegeofozarks-seal.png\n| image_size = 200px\n| motto = ''Hard Work U''\n| established = 1906<ref name=about>{{cite web |url=http://www.cofo.edu/Page/About-C-of-O.14.html |title=About C of O |publisher=College of the Ozarks |accessdate=May 8, 2016}}</ref>\n| type = [[Private university|Private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]]\n| religious_affiliation = [[Presbyterian Church USA]]\n| endowment = $505 million (2018)<ref>[https://www.cofo.edu/content/PR/pressRelease.aspx?id=7756b7fd-ef46-4352-82cc-1c15d319b50f]</ref>\n| staff = 190<ref name=about />\n| faculty = 83<ref name=about />\n| president = Jerry C.

UofO was called \"College of the Ozarks\" from 1920-87; CofO was \"School of the Ozarks\" until 1990. Many historical sources from Arkansas will use \"College of the Ozarks\" to refer to UofO, not CofO. More importantly for several notables removed from this list, CofO was merely a high school before 1956, and a junior college from 1956-65; thus any college-level classes taken at \"College of the Ozarks\" before 1956, or four-year or higher classes before 1965, must have been at UofO and *NOT* CofO.\n-->\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://cofo.edu/}}\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Colleges and universities in Missouri}}\n{{Presbyterian Colleges}}\n{{CCCU}}\n{{Work Colleges Consortium}}\n{{NCCAA Division I Central navbox}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:College Of The Ozarks}}\n[[Category:College of the Ozarks| ]]\n[[Category:Education in Taney County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:Liberal arts colleges in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 1906]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Taney County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:1906 establishments in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Universities and colleges affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (USA)]]\n[[Category:Work colleges]]\n[[Category:Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]\n[[Category:Bible colleges in Missouri]]\n", "name_user": "Ira Leviton", "label": "safe", "comment": "Deleted a duplicate \"the\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_the_Ozarks"}
