Exploited by her grandmother, Er\u00e9ndira must work all day long doing the house chores, until she sleeps walk exhausted. The heartless grandmother lives in her own world, talking to herself and crying uncontrollably with sentimental French songs. One day Er\u00e9ndira is so tired from all the work that she falls sleep without extinguishing the candles. The curtains catch fire accidentally burning the house down to the foundation walls.\n\nHaving calculated the debt Er\u00e9ndira owes her for the destruction of her home and belongings, the grandmother decides the only way the girl will be able to repay such a vast amount is by prostituting herself. Er\u00e9ndira submits to her fate without a protest and the grandmother does not waste any time trading Er\u00e9ndira's virginity to a local merchant for 250 pesos and three days\u2019 provisions for their trip. When Er\u00e9ndira resists, the man slaps and rapes her.\n\nEr\u00e9ndira and her grandmother subsequently travel through the desert while the young girl sells her body to countless men \u2013 peasants, Indians, humble workers, soldiers and the smugglers that populate the region. The grandmother collects the money, makes all decisions, and pays the Indian servants. As the business prospers it achieves carnivalesque proportions: the two women are joined by hangers-on, vendors, musicians, and a mysterious photographer.\n\nOne day having had sex with an army of soldiers, Er\u00e9ndira falls sick and the line of men waiting outside her tent is dismissed. Then, Ulises, the young son of a smuggler traveling through the region, sneaks into the tent after the old woman has gone to sleep. Er\u00e9ndira finds him charming; she charges him for her services and teaches him how to make love. By the next morning Ulises has fallen in love with her.\n\nEn route from one town to the next, a group of monks take Er\u00e9ndira away from the grip of her grandmother sending her to their mission in the desert until she marries. Undaunted, the grandmother hires a Mexican peasant boy to marry Er\u00e9ndira and thus gets her granddaughter back in the same old rut. To undermine any further attempts by the priests to confiscate her money-making resource, the grandmother must obtain a letter from someone important testifying to her granddaughter's high moral character. The grandmother sends Er\u00e9ndira to Senator On\u00e9simo Sanchez, a man dying of some mysterious disease. The crafty woman locks a chastity belt on Er\u00e9ndira, which the Senator discovers cannot be unlocked until he writes the letter.\n\nThe grandmother's business suffers a second setback when Ulises reappears and persuades Er\u00e9ndira to run off with him. His plan is to live off a fortune from oranges which contain diamonds smuggled by his Dutch father. The young couple heads for the border in a truck the boy has stolen from his father. Finally caught, Er\u00e9ndira watches from the halted truck as her lover suffers a whipping from his father. The grandmother, preventing a new escape attempt, chains her granddaughter to the bed. However, angry prostitutes, bereft of business because Er\u00e9ndira is in town, march to their competitor's tent and haul the young woman out of it over the old woman's curses.\n\nBy now the Grandmother is quite wealthy. She and Er\u00e9ndira live in a large tent beside the sea, furnished even more grandly than the lost desert home. The old woman plays her piano, bathes, and gives orders to her now hardened charge. Realizing that only her grandmother's death would free her, Er\u00e9ndira pushes Ulises to kill the old woman. Ulises first two attempts on her life by poisoning and an explosive are unsuccessful. Finally, goaded by Er\u00e9ndira, he picks up a kitchen knife and stabs the old woman in the back. With his grandmother's death, Er\u00e9ndira's palm suddenly acquires lines. She picks up her grandmother's vest of gold and runs off into the desert. Ulises is left alone crying.\"No voice on earth could stop me,\" Er\u00e9ndira tells us in a voice over as she disappears into the desert. \"And no trace of my misfortune was ever found.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Irene Papas]] as the grandmother\n* [[Cl\u00e1udia Ohana]] as Er\u00e9ndira\n* [[Michael Lonsdale]] as Senator On\u00e9simo Sanchez\n* [[Oliver Wehe]] as Ulysses\n* [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]] as the photographer\n* [[Blanca Guerra]] as Ulysses' mother\n* [[Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz]] as the grocer\n* [[Pierre Vaneck]] as Ulysses' father\n* [[Carlos Card\u00e1n]] as Smuggler\n* [[Humberto Elizondo]] as Blacaman\n* [[Jorge Feg\u00e1n]] as the commander\n* [[Francisco Mauri]] as the postman\n* Sergio Calder\u00f3n as the truck driver\n* [[Mart\u00edn Palomares]] as escort\n* [[Salvador Garcini]] as puppet-player\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 56th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Mexican submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Garc\u00eda Saucedo, Jaime.

Exploited by her grandmother, Er\u00e9ndira must work all day long doing the house chores, until she sleeps walk exhausted. The heartless grandmother lives in her own world, talking to herself and crying uncontrollably with sentimental French songs. One day Er\u00e9ndira is so tired from all the work that she falls sleep without extinguishing the candles. The curtains catch fire accidentally burning the house down to the foundation walls.\n\nHaving calculated the debt Er\u00e9ndira owes her for the destruction of her home and belongings, the grandmother decides the only way the girl will be able to repay such a vast amount is by prostituting herself. Er\u00e9ndira submits to her fate without a protest and the grandmother does not waste any time trading Er\u00e9ndira's virginity to a local merchant for 250 pesos and three days\u2019 provisions for their trip. When Er\u00e9ndira resists, the man slaps and rapes her.\n\nEr\u00e9ndira and her grandmother subsequently travel through the desert while the young girl sells her body to countless men \u2013 peasants, Indians, humble workers, soldiers and the smugglers that populate the region. The grandmother collects the money, makes all decisions, and pays the Indian servants. As the business prospers it achieves carnivalesque proportions: the two women are joined by hangers-on, vendors, musicians, and a mysterious photographer.\n\nOne day having had sex with an army of soldiers, Er\u00e9ndira falls sick and the line of men waiting outside her tent is dismissed. Then, Ulises, the young son of a smuggler traveling through the region, sneaks into the tent after the old woman has gone to sleep. Er\u00e9ndira finds him charming; she charges him for her services and teaches him how to make love. By the next morning Ulises has fallen in love with her.\n\nEn route from one town to the next, a group of monks take Er\u00e9ndira away from the grip of her grandmother sending her to their mission in the desert until she marries. Undaunted, the grandmother hires a Mexican peasant boy to marry Er\u00e9ndira and thus gets her granddaughter back in the same old rut. To undermine any further attempts by the priests to confiscate her money-making resource, the grandmother must obtain a letter from someone important testifying to her granddaughter's high moral character. The grandmother sends Er\u00e9ndira to Senator On\u00e9simo Sanchez, a man dying of some mysterious disease. The crafty woman locks a chastity belt on Er\u00e9ndira, which the Senator discovers cannot be unlocked until he writes the letter.\n\nThe grandmother's business suffers a second setback when Ulises reappears and persuades Er\u00e9ndira to run off with him. His plan is to live off a fortune from oranges which contain diamonds smuggled by his Dutch father. The young couple heads for the border in a truck the boy has stolen from his father. Finally caught, Er\u00e9ndira watches from the halted truck as her lover suffers a whipping from his father. The grandmother, preventing a new escape attempt, chains her granddaughter to the bed. However, angry prostitutes, bereft of business because Er\u00e9ndira is in town, march to their competitor's tent and haul the young woman out of it over the old woman's curses.\n\nBy now the Grandmother is quite wealthy. She and Er\u00e9ndira live in a large tent beside the sea, furnished even more grandly than the lost desert home. The old woman plays her piano, bathes, and gives orders to her now hardened charge. Realizing that only her grandmother's death would free her, Er\u00e9ndira pushes Ulises to kill the old woman. Ulises first two attempts on her life by poisoning and an explosive are unsuccessful. Finally, goaded by Er\u00e9ndira, he picks up a kitchen knife and stabs the old woman in the back. With his grandmother's death, Er\u00e9ndira's palm suddenly acquires lines. She picks up her grandmother's vest of gold and runs off into the desert. Ulises is left alone crying.\"No voice on earth could stop me,\" Er\u00e9ndira tells us in a voice over as she disappears into the desert. \"And no trace of my misfortune was ever found.\"\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Irene Papas]] as the grandmother\n* [[Cl\u00e1udia Ohana]] as Er\u00e9ndira\n* [[Michael Lonsdale]] as Senator On\u00e9simo Sanchez\n* [[Oliver Wehe]] as Ulysses\n* [[Rufus (actor)|Rufus]] as the photographer\n* [[Blanca Guerra]] as Ulysses' mother\n* [[Ernesto G\u00f3mez Cruz]] as the grocer\n* [[Pierre Vaneck]] as Ulysses' father\n* [[Carlos Card\u00e1n]] as Smuggler\n* [[Humberto Elizondo]] as Blacaman\n* [[Jorge Feg\u00e1n]] as the commander\n* [[Francisco Mauri]] as the postman\n* Sergio Calder\u00f3n as the truck driver\n* [[Mart\u00edn Palomares]] as escort\n* [[Salvador Garcini]] as puppet-player\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 56th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Mexican submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Garc\u00eda Saucedo, Jaime.

The [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|eighth and last leader]] of the [[Soviet Union]], he was the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1985 until 1991. He was also the country's head of state from 1988 until 1991, serving as the chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] from 1988 to 1989, chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet]] from 1989 to 1990, and [[president of the Soviet Union]] from 1990 to 1991. Ideologically, he initially adhered to [[Marxism-Leninism]] although by the early 1990s had moved toward [[social democracy]].\n\nOf mixed Russian and Ukrainian heritage, Gorbachev was born in [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]] to a poor peasant family. Growing up under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], in his youth he operated [[combine harvester]]s on a [[collective farm]] before joining the Communist Party, which then governed the Soviet Union as a [[one-party state]] according to Marxist-Leninist doctrine. While studying at [[Moscow State University]], he married fellow student [[Raisa Gorbacheva|Raisa Titarenko]] in 1953 prior to receiving his law degree in 1955. Moving to [[Stavropol]], he worked for the [[Komsomol]] youth organisation and, after Stalin's death, became a keen proponent of the [[Destalinization]] reforms of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He was appointed the First Party Secretary of the Sevastopol Regional Committee in 1970, in which position he oversaw construction of the [[Great Stavropol Canal]]. In 1978 he returned to Moscow to become a Secretary of the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and in 1979 joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Within three years of the death of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], following the brief regimes of the \u00a8old guys\u00a8 [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], the Politburo elected Gorbachev as General Secretary, the ''de facto'' head of government, in 1985.\n\nAlthough committed to preserving the Soviet state and to its [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals, Gorbachev believed significant reform was necessary, particularly after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. He withdrew from the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] and embarked on summits with United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] to limit [[nuclear weapon]]s and end the [[Cold War]]. Domestically, his policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") allowed for enhanced [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of press|press]], while his ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\") sought to decentralise economic decision making to improve efficiency. His [[Democratization (Soviet Union)|democratization]] measures and formation of the elected [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] undermined the one-party state. Gorbachev declined to intervene militarily when various [[Eastern Bloc]] countries abandoned Marxist-Leninist governance in 1989\u201390. Internally, growing [[Nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment threatened to break up the Soviet Union, leading Marxist-Leninist hardliners to launch the unsuccessful [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]] against Gorbachev in 1991. In the wake of this, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] against Gorbachev's wishes and he resigned. After leaving office, he launched his [[The Gorbachev Foundation|Gorbachev Foundation]], became a vocal critic of Russian Presidents [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Vladimir Putin]], and campaigned for Russia's social-democratic movement.\n\nWidely considered one of the most significant figures of the second half of the 20th century, Gorbachev remains the subject of controversy. The recipient of a wide range of awards\u2014including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\u2014he was widely praised for his pivotal role in ending the Cold War, curtailing human rights abuses in the Soviet Union, and tolerating both the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Marxist\u2013Leninist administrations in eastern and central Europe]] and the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Conversely, in Russia he is often derided for not stopping the Soviet collapse, an event which brought a decline in Russia's global influence and precipitated an economic crisis.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\nGorbachev was born on 2 March 1931 in the village of [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]], then in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medvedev|1y=1986|1p=22|2a1=Doder|2a2=Branson|2y=1990|2p=1|3a1=McCauley|3y=1998|3p=15|4a1=Taubman|4y=2017|4p=7}} At the time, Privolnoye was divided almost evenly between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=10}} Gorbachev's paternal family were ethnic Russians and had moved to the region from [[Voronezh]] several generations before; his maternal family were of ethnic Ukrainian heritage and had migrated from [[Chernigov]].{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=15|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=10}}\nHis parents named him Victor, but at the insistence of his mother\u2014a devout [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]\u2014he had a secret [[baptism]], where his grandfather christened him Mikhail.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=4|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=15|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=7}} His relationship with his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev, was close; his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (n\u00e9e Gopkalo), was colder and punitive.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=8\u20139}} His parents were poor,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=9}} and lived as peasants.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=22}} They had married as teenagers in 1928,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=16}} and in keeping with local tradition had initially resided in Sergei's father's house, an adobe-walled hut, before a hut of their own could be built.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=16, 17}}\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Gorbachev and his [[Ukrainians in Russia|Ukrainian]] maternal grandparents, late 1930s]]\n\nThe Soviet Union was a [[one-party state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], and during Gorbachev's childhood was under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Stalin had initiated a project of [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|mass rural collectivisation]] which, in keeping with his [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] ideas, he believed would help convert the country into a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist society]].{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=1|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=7}} Gorbachev's maternal grandfather joined the Communist Party and helped form the village's first [[kolkhoz]] (collective farm) in 1929, becoming its chair.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=15|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=12\u201313}} This farm was {{convert|12|mi|km|order=flip}} outside Privolnoye village and when he was three years old, Gorbachev left his parental home and moved into the kolkhoz with his maternal grandparents.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=14}}\n\nThe country was then experiencing the [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333|famine of 1932\u201333]], in which two of Gorbachev's paternal uncles and an aunt died.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=16|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=7}} This was followed by the [[Great Purge]], in which individuals accused of being \"[[enemy of the people|enemies of the people]]\"\u2014including those sympathetic to rival interpretations of [[Marxism]] like [[Trotskyism]]\u2014were arrested and interned in labour camps, if not executed. Both of Gorbachev's grandfathers were arrested\u2014his maternal in 1934 and his paternal in 1937\u2014and both spent time in [[Gulag]] labour camps prior to being released.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1pp=15\u201316|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=7, 8}} After his December 1938 release, Gorbachev's maternal grandfather discussed having been tortured by [[Joint State Political Directorate|the secret police]], an account that influenced the young boy.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nFollowing on from the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, in June 1941 the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] invaded the Soviet Union.

They accepted without asking for an exam, likely because of his worker-peasant origins and his possession of the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=6, 8|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=18|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3pp=40\u201341}} His choice of law was unusual; it was not a well-regarded subject in Soviet society at that time.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=35}} Aged 19, he travelled by train to Moscow, the first time he had left his home region.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=43}}\n\nIn the city, he resided with fellow MSU students at a dormitory in [[Sokolniki District]].{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=50}} He and other rural students felt at odds with their Muscovite counterparts but he soon came to fit in.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=44}} Fellow students recall him working especially hard, often late into the night.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=14|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=48}} He gained a reputation as a mediator during disputes,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=53}} and was also known for being outspoken in class, although would only reveal a number of his views privately; for instance he confided in some students his opposition to the Soviet jurisprudential norm that a confession proved guilt, noting that confessions could have been forced.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=52}} During his studies, an [[Anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] campaign spread through the Soviet Union, culminating in the [[Doctors' plot]]; Gorbachev publicly defended a Jewish student who was accused of disloyalty to the country by one of their fellows.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=19|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=45, 52}}\n\nAt MSU, he became the Komsomol head of his entering class, and then Komsomol's deputy secretary for agitation and propaganda at the law school.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=10|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=19|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=46}} One of his first Komsomol assignments in Moscow was to monitor the election polling in [[Krasnopresnenskaya]] district to ensure the government's desire for near total turnout; Gorbachev found that most of those who voted did so \"out of fear\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=46}} In 1952, he was appointed a full member of the Communist Party.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=19|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=46}} As a party and Komsomol member he was tasked with monitoring fellow students for potential subversion; some of his fellow students said that he did so only minimally and that they trusted him to keep confidential information secret from the authorities.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=47}} Gorbachev became close friends with [[Zden\u011bk Mlyn\u00e1\u0159]], a [[Demographics of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] student who later became a primary ideologist of the 1968 [[Prague Spring]].

It reflected a compromise: ministers would retain the ability to set output targets but these would not be considered binding.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=312}} That month, a plenum accepted his recommendations and the [[Supreme Soviet]] passed a \"law on enterprises\" implementing the changes.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=239|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=313}} Economic problems remained: by the late 1980s there were still widespread shortages of basic goods, rising inflation, and declining living standards.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=115|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=434\u2013435, 449\u2013450}} These stoked a number of miners' strikes in 1989.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=116|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=450}}\n\nBy 1987, the ethos of glasnost had spread through Soviet society: journalists were writing increasingly openly,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=314}} many economic problems were being publicly revealed,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=338\u2013339}} and studies appeared that critically reassessed Soviet history.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=317}} Gorbachev was broadly supportive, describing glasnost as \"the crucial, irreplaceable weapon of perestroika\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=314}} He nevertheless insisted that people should use the newfound freedom responsibly, stating that journalists and writers should avoid \"sensationalism\" and be \"completely objective\" in their reporting.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=315}} Nearly two hundred previously restricted Soviet films were publicly released, and a range of Western films were also made available.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=151|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=341}} In 1989, Soviet culpability for the 1940 [[Katyn massacre]] was finally revealed.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=131}}\n\nIn September 1987, the government stopped jamming the signal of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] and [[Voice of America]].{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=217|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=397}} The reforms also included greater tolerance of religion;{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=74|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=340}} an [[Easter]] service was broadcast on Soviet television for the first time and the millennium celebrations of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] were given media attention.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=290|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=340}} Independent organisations appeared, most supportive of Gorbachev, although the largest, [[Pamyat]], was ultra-nationalist and anti-Semitic in nature.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|pp=186\u2013187}} Gorbachev also announced that Soviet Jews wishing to migrate to Israel would be allowed to do so, something previously prohibited.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=195}}\n\nIn August 1987, he holidayed in [[Nizhniaia Oreanda]], Ukraine, there writing ''Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and Our World'' at the suggestion of U.S. publishers.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=246|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=319}} For the 70th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917\u2014which brought Lenin and the Communist Party to power\u2014Gorbachev produced a speech on \"October and Perestroika: The Revolution Continues\".

While the soviets had become largely powerless bodies that rubber-stamped Politburo policies, he wanted them to become year-round legislatures.

Soviet Union would have \"exchanged totalitarian controls for milder authoritarian ones\" although not become \"democratic in the Western sense\".{{sfn|Gooding|1990|p=195}} With perestroika, Gorbachev had wanted to improve the existing Marxist-Leninist system but ultimately ended up destroying it.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=265}} In this, he brought an end to state socialism in the Soviet Union and paved the way for a transition to liberal democracy.{{sfn|Bunce|1992|p=205}}\n\nTaubman nevertheless thought Gorbachev remained a socialist.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He described Gorbachev as \"a true believer\u2014not in the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985 but in its potential to live up to what he deemed its original ideals.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He added that \"until the end, Gorbachev reiterated his belief in socialism, insisting that it wasn't worthy of the name unless it was truly democratic.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=690}}\nAs Soviet leader, Gorbachev believed in incremental reform rather than a radical transformation;{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} he later referred to this as a \"revolution by evolutionary means\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} Doder and Branson noted that over the course of the 1980s, his thought underwent a \"radical evolution\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=386}} Taubman noted that by 1989 or 1990, Gorbachev had transformed into a social democrat.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=678}} McCauley suggested that by at least June 1991 Gorbachev was a \"post-Leninist\", having \"liberated himself\" from Marxism-Leninism.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=220}} After the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly formed Communist Party of the Russian Federation would have nothing to do with him.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=259}} However, in 2006, he expressed his continued belief in Lenin's ideas: \"I trusted him then and I still do\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He claimed that \"the essence of Lenin\" was a desire to develop \"the living creative activity of the masses\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} Taubman believed that Gorbachev identified with Lenin on a psychological level.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=216}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Gorbachev Party

self-conscious\",{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=16}} noting that unlike most Russian intelligentsia, Gorbachev was not closely connected \"to the world of science, culture, the arts, or education\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=150}}  When living in Stavropol he and his wife collected hundreds of books.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=114\u2013115}} Among his favourite authors were [[Arthur

natural environments,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=163}} and was also a fan of [[association football]].{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=347}} He favoured small gatherings where the assembled discussed topics like

Trotsky]].{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=43}} Medvedev also considered Gorbachev \"a charismatic leader\", something Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko had not been.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=165}} Doder and Branson called him \"a charmer capable of intellectually seducing doubters, always trying to co-opt them, or at least blunt the edge of their criticism\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=287}} McCauley thought Gorbachev displayed \"great tactical skill\" in manoeuvring successfully between hardline Marxist-Leninists and liberalisers for most of his time as leader, although added that he was \"much more skilled at tactical, short-term policy than strategic, long-term thinking\", in part because he was \"given to making policy on the hoof\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\nDoder and Branson thought Gorbachev \"a Russian to the core, intensely patriotic as only people living in the border regions can be.\"{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=22}} \nTaubman also noted that the former Soviet leader has a \"sense of self-importance and self-righteousness\" as well as a \"need for attention and admiration\" which grated on some of his colleagues.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=134}} He was sensitive to personal criticism and easily took offense.{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=161|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2pp=134, 135}} Colleagues were often frustrated that he would leave tasks unfinished,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=117}} and sometimes also felt underappreciated and discarded by him.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=273}} Biographers Doder and Branson thought that Gorbachev was \"a puritan\" with \"a proclivity for order in his personal life\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=14}} Taubman noted that he was \"capable of blowing up for calculated effect\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=516}} He also thought that by 1990, when his domestic popularity was waning, Gorbachev become \"psychologically dependent on being lionized abroad\", a trait for which he was criticised in the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=541}} McCauley was of the view that \"one of his weaknesses was an inability to foresee the consequences of his actions\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=161}}\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n\nOpinions on Gorbachev are deeply divided.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=1}} Many, particularly in Western countries, see him as the greatest statesman of the second half of the twentieth century.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=1, 539}} U.S. press referred to the presence of \"Gorbymania\" in Western countries during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as represented by large crowds that turned out to greet his visits,{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=286|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=138}} with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine naming him its \"Man of the Decade\" in the 1980s.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=391}} In the Soviet Union itself, opinion polls indicated that Gorbachev was the most popular politician from 1985 through to late 1989.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=267}} For his domestic supporters, Gorbachev was seen as a reformer trying to modernise the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=396}} and to build a form of democratic socialism.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=410}} Taubman characterised Gorbachev as \"a visionary who changed his country and the world\u2014though neither as much as he wished.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} Taubman regarded Gorbachev as being \"exceptional... as a Russian ruler and a world statesman\", highlighting that he avoided the \"traditional, authoritarian, anti-Western norm\" of both predecessors like Brezhnev and successors like Putin.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=687}} McCauley thought that in allowing the Soviet Union to move away from Marxism-Leninism, Gorbachev gave the Soviet people \"something precious, the right to think and manage their lives for themselves\", with all the uncertainty and risk that that entailed.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=278\u2013279}}\n\n{{Quote box\n| quote = Gorbachev succeeded in destroying what was left of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union; he brought freedom of speech, of assembly, and of conscience to people who had never known it, except perhaps for a few chaotic months in 1917.

It is more the fault of the raw material he worked with than of his own real shortcomings and mistakes that Russian democracy will take much longer to build than he thought.\n| source=\u2014 Gorbachev biographer William Taubman, 2017{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}}\n| align = left\n| width = 25em\n}}\n\nGorbachev's negotiations with the U.S. helped bring an end to the Cold War and reduced the threat of nuclear conflict.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} His decision to allow the Eastern Bloc to break apart prevented significant bloodshed in Central and Eastern Europe; as Taubman noted, this meant that the \"[[Soviet Empire]]\" ended in a far more peaceful manner than the [[British Empire]] several decades before.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} Similarly, under Gorbachev, the Soviet Union broke apart without falling into civil war, as happened during the breakup of Yugoslavia at the same time.{{sfnm|1a1=Bunce|1y=1992|1p=205|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=275}} McCauley noted that in facilitating the merger of East and West Germany, Gorbachev was \"a co-father of German unification\", assuring him long-term popularity among the German people.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=197}}\n\nHe also faced domestic criticism during his rule. During his career, Gorbachev attracted the admiration of some colleagues, but others came to hate him.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=134}} Across society more broadly, his inability to reverse the decline in the Soviet economy brought discontent.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=388}} Liberals thought he lacked the radicalism to really break from Marxism-Leninism and establish a free market liberal democracy.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=416|2a1=Steele|2y=1996|2p=145}} Conversely, many of his Communist Party critics thought his reforms were reckless and threatened the survival of Soviet socialism;{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=324}} some believed he should have followed the example of China's Communist Party and restricted himself to economic rather than governmental reforms.{{sfn|Steele|1996|p=145}} Many Russians saw his emphasis on persuasion rather than force as a sign of weakness.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=690}}\n\nFor much of the Communist Party nomenklatura, the Soviet Union's dissolution was disastrous as it resulted in their loss of power.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=276}} In Russia, he is widely despised for his role in the collapse of the Soviet Union and the ensuing economic collapse.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=1}} General Varennikov, one of those who orchestrated the 1991 coup attempt against Gorbachev, for instance called him \"a renegade and traitor to your own people\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=659}} Many of his critics attacked him for allowing the Marxist-Leninist governments across Eastern Europe to fall,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=268}} and for allowing a reunited Germany to join NATO, something they deem to be contrary to Russia's national interest.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=691}}\n\nThe historian Mark Galeotti stressed the connection between Gorbachev and his predecessor, Andropov. In Galeotti's view, Andropov was \"the godfather of the Gorbachev revolution\", because\u2014as a former head of the KGB\u2014he was able to put forward the case for reform without having his loyalty to the Soviet cause questioned, an approach that Gorbachev was able to build on and follow through with.{{sfn|Galeotti|1997|p=35}} According to McCauley, Gorbachev \"set reforms in motion without understanding where they could lead.

The [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|eighth and last leader]] of the [[Soviet Union]], he was the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1985 until 1991. He was also the country's head of state from 1988 until 1991, serving as the chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] from 1988 to 1989, chairman of the [[Supreme Soviet]] from 1989 to 1990, and [[president of the Soviet Union]] from 1990 to 1991. Ideologically, he initially adhered to [[Marxism-Leninism]] although by the early 1990s had moved toward [[social democracy]].\n\nOf mixed Russian and Ukrainian heritage, Gorbachev was born in [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]] to a poor peasant family. Growing up under the rule of [[Joseph Stalin]], in his youth he operated [[combine harvester]]s on a [[collective farm]] before joining the Communist Party, which then governed the Soviet Union as a [[one-party state]] according to Marxist-Leninist doctrine. While studying at [[Moscow State University]], he married fellow student [[Raisa Gorbacheva|Raisa Titarenko]] in 1953 prior to receiving his law degree in 1955. Moving to [[Stavropol]], he worked for the [[Komsomol]] youth organisation and, after Stalin's death, became a keen proponent of the [[Destalinization]] reforms of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. He was appointed the First Party Secretary of the Sevastopol Regional Committee in 1970, in which position he oversaw construction of the [[Great Stavropol Canal]]. In 1978 he returned to Moscow to become a Secretary of the party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and in 1979 joined its governing [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]. Within three years of the death of Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], following the brief regimes of the \u00a8old guys\u00a8 [[Yuri Andropov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], the Politburo elected Gorbachev as General Secretary, the ''de facto'' head of government, in 1985.\n\nAlthough committed to preserving the Soviet state and to its [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals, Gorbachev believed significant reform was necessary, particularly after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. He withdrew from the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]] and embarked on summits with United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] to limit [[nuclear weapon]]s and end the [[Cold War]]. Domestically, his policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (\"openness\") allowed for enhanced [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of press|press]], while his ''[[perestroika]]'' (\"restructuring\") sought to decentralise economic decision making to improve efficiency. His [[Democratization (Soviet Union)|democratization]] measures and formation of the elected [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] undermined the one-party state. Gorbachev declined to intervene militarily when various [[Eastern Bloc]] countries abandoned Marxist-Leninist governance in 1989\u201390. Internally, growing [[Nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment threatened to break up the Soviet Union, leading Marxist-Leninist hardliners to launch the unsuccessful [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August Coup]] against Gorbachev in 1991. In the wake of this, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] against Gorbachev's wishes and he resigned. After leaving office, he launched his [[The Gorbachev Foundation|Gorbachev Foundation]], became a vocal critic of Russian Presidents [[Boris Yeltsin]] and [[Vladimir Putin]], and campaigned for Russia's social-democratic movement.\n\nWidely considered one of the most significant figures of the second half of the 20th century, Gorbachev remains the subject of controversy. The recipient of a wide range of awards\u2014including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\u2014he was widely praised for his pivotal role in ending the Cold War, curtailing human rights abuses in the Soviet Union, and tolerating both the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Marxist\u2013Leninist administrations in eastern and central Europe]] and the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]]. Conversely, in Russia he is often derided for not stopping the Soviet collapse, an event which brought a decline in Russia's global influence and precipitated an economic crisis.\n\n==Early life==\n===Childhood: 1931\u20131950===\nGorbachev was born on 2 March 1931 in the village of [[Privolnoye, Krasnogvardeysky District, Stavropol Krai|Privolnoye]], [[Stavropol Krai]], then in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], one of the constituent republics of the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfnm|1a1=Medvedev|1y=1986|1p=22|2a1=Doder|2a2=Branson|2y=1990|2p=1|3a1=McCauley|3y=1998|3p=15|4a1=Taubman|4y=2017|4p=7}} At the time, Privolnoye was divided almost evenly between ethnic Russians and ethnic Ukrainians.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=10}} Gorbachev's paternal family were ethnic Russians and had moved to the region from [[Voronezh]] several generations before; his maternal family were of ethnic Ukrainian heritage and had migrated from [[Chernigov]].{{sfnm|1a1=McCauley|1y=1998|1p=15|2a1=Taubman|2y=2017|2p=10}}\nHis parents named him Victor, but at the insistence of his mother\u2014a devout [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]\u2014he had a secret [[baptism]], where his grandfather christened him Mikhail.{{sfnm|1a1=Doder|1a2=Branson|1y=1990|1p=4|2a1=McCauley|2y=1998|2p=15|3a1=Taubman|3y=2017|3p=7}} His relationship with his father, Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev, was close; his mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (n\u00e9e Gopkalo), was colder and punitive.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=8\u20139}} His parents were poor,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=9}} and lived as peasants.{{sfn|Medvedev|1986|p=22}} They had married as teenagers in 1928,{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=16}} and in keeping with local tradition had initially resided in Sergei's father's house, an adobe-walled hut, before a hut of their own could be built.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|pp=16, 17}}\n\n[[File:\u041c\u0438\u0448\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0451\u0432 \u0441 \u0434\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c \u041f\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0435\u043c \u0438 \u0431\u0430\u0431\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0439.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Gorbachev and his [[Ukrainians in Russia|Ukrainian]] maternal grandparents, late 1930s]]\n\nThe Soviet Union was a [[one-party state]] governed by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]], and during Gorbachev's childhood was under the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]].

Gorbachev (close-up).jpg|thumb|left|Gorbachev in 1987]]\n\nGorbachev's political outlook was shaped by the 23 years he served as a party official in Stavropol.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=22}} Doder and Branson thought that throughout most of his political career prior to becoming General Secretary, \"his publicly expressed views almost certainly reflected a politician's understanding of what should be said, rather than his personal philosophy. Otherwise he could not have survived politically.\"{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=9}} \nLike many Russians, Gorbachev sometimes thought of the Soviet Union as being largely synonymous with Russia and in various speeches described it as \"Russia\"; in one incident he had to correct himself after calling the USSR \"Russia\" while giving a speech in Kiev, Ukraine.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=22}}\n\nMcCauley noted that perestroika was \"an elusive concept\", one which \"evolved and eventually meant something radically different over time.\"{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=262\u2013263}} McCauley stated that the concept originally referred to \"radical reform of the economic and political system\" as part of Gorbachev's attempt to motivate the labour force and make management more effective.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=264}} It was only after initial measures to achieve this proved unsuccessful that Gorbachev began to consider market mechanisms and co-operatives, albeit with the state sector remaining dominant.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=264}} The political scientist John Gooding suggested that had the perestroika reforms succeeded, the Soviet Union would have \"exchanged totalitarian controls for milder authoritarian ones\" although not become \"democratic in the Western sense\".{{sfn|Gooding|1990|p=195}} With perestroika, Gorbachev had wanted to improve the existing Marxist-Leninist system but ultimately ended up destroying it.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=265}} In this, he brought an end to state socialism in the Soviet Union and paved the way for a transition to liberal democracy.{{sfn|Bunce|1992|p=205}}\n\nTaubman nevertheless thought Gorbachev remained a socialist.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He described Gorbachev as \"a true believer\u2014not in the Soviet system as it functioned (or didn't) in 1985 but in its potential to live up to what he deemed its original ideals.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He added that \"until the end, Gorbachev reiterated his belief in socialism, insisting that it wasn't worthy of the name unless it was truly democratic.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=690}}\nAs Soviet leader, Gorbachev believed in incremental reform rather than a radical transformation;{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} he later referred to this as a \"revolution by evolutionary means\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=218}} Doder and Branson noted that over the course of the 1980s, his thought underwent a \"radical evolution\".{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=386}} Taubman noted that by 1989 or 1990, Gorbachev had transformed into a social democrat.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=678}} McCauley suggested that by at least June 1991 Gorbachev was a \"post-Leninist\", having \"liberated himself\" from Marxism-Leninism.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=220}} After the fall of the Soviet Union, the newly formed Communist Party of the Russian Federation would have nothing to do with him.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=259}} However, in 2006, he expressed his continued belief in Lenin's ideas: \"I trusted him then and I still do\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} He claimed that \"the essence of Lenin\" was a desire to develop \"the living creative activity of the masses\".{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=215}} Taubman believed that Gorbachev identified with Lenin on a psychological level.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=216}}\n\n== Personal life ==\n[[File:Gorbachev Party

Gorbachev displayed \"great tactical skill\" in manoeuvring successfully between hardline Marxist-Leninists and liberalisers for most of his time as leader, although added that he was \"much more skilled at tactical, short-term policy than strategic, long-term thinking\", in part because he was \"given to making policy on the hoof\".{{sfn|McCauley|1998|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\nDoder and Branson

1980s.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=391}} In the Soviet Union itself, opinion polls indicated that Gorbachev was the most popular politician from 1985 through to late 1989.{{sfn|McCauley|1998|p=267}} For his domestic supporters, Gorbachev was seen as a reformer trying to modernise the Soviet Union,{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=396}} and to build a form of democratic socialism.{{sfn|Doder|Branson|1990|p=410}} Taubman characterised Gorbachev as \"a visionary who changed his country and the world\u2014though neither as much as he wished.\"{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=688}} Taubman regarded Gorbachev as being \"exceptional... as a Russian ruler and a world statesman\", highlighting that he avoided the \"traditional, authoritarian, anti-Western norm\" of both predecessors like Brezhnev and successors like Putin.{{sfn|Taubman|2017|p=687}} McCauley thought that in allowing the Soviet Union to move away from Marxism-Leninism, Gorbachev gave the Soviet people \"something

In a major blow to AQI, thousands of former Sunni militants that previously fought along with the group started to actively fight AQI and also work with the American and Iraqi forces, starting with the creation of the Anbar Awakening Council, so called because of its [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar]] origins. The group spread to all Sunni cities and communities and some Shiite areas and adopted the broader name [[Sons of Iraq]]. The Sons of Iraq was instrumental in giving tips to coalition forces about weapons caches and militants resulting in the destruction of over 2,500 weapons caches and over 800 militants being killed or captured. In addition, the 30,000 strong U.S. troop surge supplied military planners with more manpower for operations targeting Al-Qaeda in Iraq, The Mujahadeen Shura Council, [[Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna|Ansar Al-Sunnah]] and other terrorist groups. The resulting events led to dozens of high-level AQI leaders being captured or killed. Al-Qaeda seemed to have lost its foothold in Iraq and appeared to be severely crippled due to its lack of vast weapons caches, leaders, safe havens, and Iraqis willing to support them. Accordingly, the bounty issued for Abu Ayyub-al-Masri AKA Abu Hamza al-Muhajer was eventually cut from $5 million down to a mere $100,000 in April 2008.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nOn January 8 and January 28, 2008, Iraqi and U.S. forces launched [[Operation Phantom Phoenix]] and the [[Nineveh campaign]] (AKA the Mosul Campaign) killing and capturing over 4,600 militants, and locating and destroying over 3,000 weapons caches, effectively leaving AQI with one last major insurgent stronghold\u2014Diyala. On July 29, 2008, Iraqi, U.S. and Sons Of Iraq forces launched Operation Augurs of Prosperity in [[Diyala Governorate]] and surrounding areas to clear AQI out of its last stronghold. Two operations had already been launched in Diyala with mixed results, and this campaign was expected to face fierce resistance. The resulting operation left over 500 weapons caches destroyed and five militants killed; 483 militants were captured due to the lack of resistance from the insurgent forces. Twenty four high level AQI terrorists were killed or captured in the campaign.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Writings==\n''Kalim\u0101t mud\u012b\u2019a'' [Enlightening speech] is a more

In a major blow to AQI, thousands of former Sunni militants that previously fought along with the group started to actively fight AQI and also work with the American and Iraqi forces, starting with the creation of the Anbar Awakening Council, so called because of its [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar]] origins. The group spread to all Sunni cities and communities and some Shiite areas and adopted the broader name [[Sons of Iraq]]. The Sons of Iraq was instrumental in giving tips to coalition forces about weapons caches and militants resulting in the destruction of over 2,500 weapons caches and over 800 militants being killed or captured. In addition, the 30,000 strong U.S. troop surge supplied military planners with more manpower for operations targeting Al-Qaeda in Iraq, The Mujahadeen Shura Council, [[Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna|Ansar Al-Sunnah]] and other terrorist groups. The resulting events led to dozens of high-level AQI leaders being captured or killed. Al-Qaeda seemed to have lost its foothold in Iraq and appeared to be severely crippled due to its lack of vast weapons caches, leaders, safe havens, and Iraqis willing to support them. Accordingly, the bounty issued for Abu Ayyub-al-Masri AKA Abu Hamza al-Muhajer was eventually cut from $5 million down to a mere $100,000 in April 2008.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nOn January 8 and January 28, 2008, Iraqi and U.S. forces launched [[Operation Phantom Phoenix]] and the [[Nineveh campaign]] (AKA the Mosul Campaign) killing and capturing over 4,600 militants, and locating and destroying over 3,000 weapons caches, effectively leaving AQI with one last major insurgent stronghold\u2014Diyala. On July 29, 2008, Iraqi, U.S. and Sons Of Iraq forces launched Operation Augurs of Prosperity in [[Diyala Governorate]] and surrounding areas to clear AQI out of its last stronghold. Two operations had already been launched in Diyala with mixed results, and this campaign was expected to face fierce resistance. The resulting operation left over 500 weapons caches destroyed and five militants killed; 483 militants were captured due to the lack of resistance from the insurgent forces. Twenty four high level AQI terrorists were killed or captured in the campaign.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Writings==\n''Kalim\u0101t mud\u012b\u2019a'' [Enlightening speech] is a more than 600-page compilation of his writings and transcribed speeches.<ref>Cole Bunzel, [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-ideology-of-the-Islamic-State.pdf \"From Paper State to Caliphate: The Ideology of the Islamic State\"], The Brookings Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World Analysis Paper | No. 19, March 2015, p. 14</ref>\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box| title = Head of [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]]| years = 1994\u20132006| before = Position Created|after = [[Abu Hamza al-Muhajir]] ([[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]])}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last1=Brisard |first1=Jean-Charles |author-link1=Jean-Charles Brisard |last2=Martinez |first2=Damien |date=2005 |title=Zarqaoui : le nouveau visage d'al-Qa\u00efda |publisher=Fayard |language=fr}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kepel |first=Gilles |date=2005 |title=Al-Qaida dans le texte : \u00e9crits d'Oussama ben Laden, Abdallah Azzam, Ayman al-Zawahiri et Abou Moussab al-Zarqawi |location=Paris, France |publisher=Presses universitaires de France (PUF) |isbn=9782130561514 |author-link=Gilles Kepel |language=fr}}\n* {{cite book |last=Milelli |first=Jean-Pierre |date=2005 |title=La lettre d'al-Zarqaoui \u00e0 Ben Laden |location=Paris, France |publisher=Choiseul |page= |isbn= |language=fr}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Jordan|Biography}}\n* [[Osama bin Laden]]\n* [[Abdel Majid al-Majali]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{commons-inline}}\n* {{NYTtopic|people/z/abu_musab_al_zarqawi}}\n;Articles\n* [http://www.flatearthnews.net/footnotes-book/page-205-zarqawi/how-zarqawi-myth-was-made-america/ 'How the Zarqawi myth was made in America'], [[Nick Davies]]\n* [http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;res=IELAPA;dn=200610624 Zarqawi: Taking Care of Business], [[Daniel Ross (Australian philosopher and filmmaker)|Daniel Ross]], August 1, 2006\n* [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/alzarqawi-a-life-drenched-in-blood-481636.html \"Al-Zarqawi: A life drenched in blood\"], Patrick Cockburn, ''[[The Independent]]'', June 9, 2006\n* [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/the-short-violent-life-of-abu-musab-al-zarqawi/304983/?single_page=true The Short, Violent Life of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi], Mary Anne Weaver, ''[[The Atlantic]]'', June 1, 2006\n\n{{3IC}}\n{{Al-Qaeda}}\n{{Militant Islamism in the Middle East}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zarqawi, Abu Musab}}\n[[Category:1966 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century criminals]]\n[[Category:21st-century criminals]]\n[[Category:Members of al-Qaeda in Iraq]]\n[[Category:Deaths by American airstrikes]]\n[[Category:Iraqi insurgency (2003\u20132011)]]\n[[Category:Jordanian al-Qaeda members]]\n[[Category:Jordanian expatriates in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Jordanian expatriates in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Jordanian prisoners and detainees]]\n[[Category:People sentenced to death in absentia]]\n[[Category:Prisoners and detainees of Jordan]]\n[[Category:Terrorism in Iraq]]\n[[Category:Filmed assassinations]]\n[[Category:People from Zarqa]]\n[[Category:Critics of Shia Islam]]\n[[Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]\n[[Category:Millennium attack plots]]\n[[Category:Leaders of Islamic terror groups]]\n[[Category:People who memorized the Quran]]\n", "name_user": "Peterpaavola", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi"}

Therefore, the object need not be marked to distinguish it from the subject:\nE.g.:\n* ''me observa vu'' \u2013 \"I observe you\"\n* ''vu observa me'' \u2013 \"you observe me\"\n\nThe accusative (direct object) is therefore most often identical to the nominative (subject). However, in case of an ambiguity problem, an optional accusative ending, '''''-m''''' ('''''-em''''' after a consonant), is available but is rarely used. The preposition '''''em''''' is equivalent to this ending.\n\nThe personal possessive adjectives are formed from the pronouns by adding '''''-n''''' or after a consonant '''''-en'''''. This is in fact the genitive (possessive) of the pronoun so ''men'' means both \"my\" and \"mine\" (\"of me\"):\nE.g.:\n* \"My dog\" = Men Hunde\n* \"The dog is mine\" = Li Hunde es men\n\nPossession may also be expressed with the preposition '''''de''''': ''de me'', ''de vu'', and so on.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In English the forms are often the same, using the auxiliary verb ''to be'' followed by the past participle. However, the passive of becoming is also often expressed with the verb ''to get'' which is used in the examples below.\n\nThe passive voice of becoming is formed with the auxiliary '''''bli''''' followed by the root verb form.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is used as in English.\n\nThere is no indefinite article, although ''un'' (one) can be used.\n\n===Nouns===\nThe plural noun is formed by adding '''''\u2013s''''' to the singular ('''''-es''''' after a consonant).\n\nThe [[accusative case]] is generally identical to the [[nominative case|nominative]] but can optionally be marked with the ending '''''-m''''' ('''''-em''''' after a consonant) with the plural being '''''-sem''''' ('''''-esem''''' after a consonant) or with the preposition '''''em'''''.\n\nThe genitive is formed with the ending '''''-n''''' ('''''-en''''' after a consonant) with the plural being '''''-sen''''' ('''''-esen''''' after a consonant) or with the preposition '''''de'''''.\n\nOther cases are formed with prepositions.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAll adjectives end in '''''-i''''', but this may be dropped if it is easy enough to pronounce and no confusion will be caused. Adjectives precede the noun qualified. Adjectives do not agree with the noun but may be given noun endings if there is no noun present to receive them.\n\nComparative adjectives are formed by placing various particles (''plu, tam,'' and ''min'') in front of the adjective receiving the comparison. Likewise, the superlative particles (''maxim'' and ''minim'') precede the adjective. The adjective does not receive an inflection to its ending.\n\n===Adverbs===\nAn adjective is converted to a corresponding adverb by adding '''''-m''''' after the '''''-i''''' ending of the adjective.\n\nComparative and superlative adverbs are formed in the same manner as comparative and superlative adjectives: by placing a specific particle before the adverb receiving the comparison.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n===Affixes===\nSee the [[b:Novial/Hound Appendix 1|Table of Prefixes]] and [[b:Novial/Hound Appendix 2|Table of Suffixes]] at the Novial Wikibook.\n\n==Novial compared to Esperanto and Ido==\n{{See also|Comparison between Esperanto and Novial|Comparison between Ido and Novial}}\n\nJespersen was a professional linguist, unlike Esperanto's creator.{{POV-inline|date=September 2019}} He disliked the arbitrary and artificial character that he found in Esperanto and Ido.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Additionally, he objected to those languages' [[inflection]]al systems, which he found needlessly complex. He sought to make Novial at once euphonious and regular while also preserving useful structures from natural languages.\n\nIn Novial:\n* Syntax is largely a matter of word order, as in [[English language|English]] and modern [[Scandinavian language]]s. There is no obligatory [[Accusative case|accusative]] marker as in Esperanto, but the accusative may optionally be marked with either an accusative ending or an accusative preposition.\n* A [[genitive]] or [[possessive case]] is available as an alternative to the preposition ''de''. This is based on Jespersen's observation that many modern languages have lost complex noun inflections, yet retain a possessive form.\n* Auxiliary particles express most [[verb]] [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]. An inflectional ending is available as a shorthand for the simple [[past tense]].\n\nA major difference between Novial and Esperanto/Ido concerns [[noun]] endings. Jespersen rejected a single vowel to terminate all nouns (-o in Esperanto/Ido), finding it unnatural and potentially confusing. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54694/54694-h/54694-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of International Language and Science}}</ref> Instead, Novial nouns may end in ''-o'', ''-a'', ''-e'', or ''-u'' or ''-um''. These endings may be taken to indicate natural sex according to the custom in Romance languages. Also there is no grammatical gender or requirement for [[adjective]]s to agree with nouns.\n\n==Language sample for comparison==\nHere is [[the Lord's Prayer]] in Novial and several related languages:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Novial version:'''\n|'''[[Esperanto]] version:'''\n|'''[[Ido (language)|Ido]] version:'''\n|'''[[Latin]] version:'''\n|-\n|\nNusen Patre, kel es in siele,<br/>\nmey vun nome bli sanktifika,<br/>\nmey vun regno veni;<br/>\nmey on fa vun volio<br/>\nkom in siele anke sur tere.<br/>\nDona a nus disdi li omnidiali pane,<br/>\ne pardona a nus nusen ofensos,<br/>\nkom anke nus pardona a nusen ofensantes,<br/>\ne non dukte nus en tentatione,<br/>\nma liberisa nus fro malu.<br/>\nAmen.\n|\nPatro nia, kiu estas en la \u0109ielo,<br/>\nVia nomo estu sanktigita.<br/>\nVenu Via regno,<br/>\nplenumi\u011du Via volo,<br/>\nkiel en la \u0109ielo, tiel anka\u016d sur la tero.<br/>\nNian panon \u0109iutagan donu al ni hodia\u016d.<br/>\nKaj pardonu al ni niajn \u015duldojn,<br/>\nkiel anka\u016d ni pardonas al niaj \u015duldantoj.<br/>\nKaj ne konduku nin en tenton,<br/>\nsed liberigu nin de la malbono.<br/>\nAmen.\n|\nPatro nia, qua esas en la cielo,<br/>\ntua nomo santigesez;<br/>\ntua regno advenez;<br/>\ntua volo facesez<br/>\nquale en la cielo tale anke sur la tero.<br/>\nDonez a ni cadie l'omnadia pano,<br/>\ne pardonez a ni nia ofensi,<br/>\nquale anke ni pardonas a nia ofensanti,<br/>\ne ne duktez ni aden la tento,<br/>\nma liberigez ni del malajo.<br/>\nAmen.\n|\nPater noster, qui es in caelis:<br/>\nsanctificetur Nomen Tuum;<br/>\nadveniat Regnum Tuum;<br/>\nfiat voluntas Tua, <br/>\nsicut in caelo, et in terra.<br/>\nPanem nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie;<br/>\net dimitte nobis debita nostra,<br/>\nSicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris;<br/>\net ne nos inducas in tentationem;<br/>\nsed libera nos a Malo.<br/>\nAmen.\n|}\n\n==Criticism==\nAs Jespersen relates in his autobiography, in 1934 he proposed an orthographic reform to Novial, which displeased a part of the users. Jespersen abandoned the essential principle of ''one sound, one letter'' :<ref>Jespersen, Otto (1995 [1938]).

(...) Thus the sound [k], besides being represented by the letters ''k'' and ''q'' and the first part of ''x'', also acquired the new sign ''c'' (before ''a, o, u'' and consonants), a practice with which nearly all Europeans, Americans, and Australians are familiar from childhood. (...)

Therefore, the object need not be marked to distinguish it from the subject:\nE.g.:\n* ''me observa vu'' \u2013 \"I observe you\"\n* ''vu observa me'' \u2013 \"you observe me\"\n\nThe accusative (direct object) is therefore most often identical to the nominative (subject). However, in case of an ambiguity problem, an optional accusative ending, '''''-m''''' ('''''-em''''' after a consonant), is available but is rarely used. The preposition '''''em''''' is equivalent to this ending.\n\nThe personal possessive adjectives are formed from the pronouns by adding '''''-n''''' or after a consonant '''''-en'''''. This is in fact the genitive (possessive) of the pronoun so ''men'' means both \"my\" and \"mine\" (\"of me\"):\nE.g.:\n* \"My dog\" = Men Hunde\n* \"The dog is mine\" = Li Hunde es men\n\nPossession may also be expressed with the preposition '''''de''''': ''de me'', ''de vu'', and so on.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is used as in English.\n\nThere is no indefinite article, although ''un'' (one) can be used.\n\n===Nouns===\nThe plural noun is formed by adding '''''\u2013s''''' to the singular ('''''-es''''' after a consonant).\n\nThe [[accusative case]] is generally identical to the [[nominative case|nominative]] but can optionally be marked with the ending '''''-m''''' ('''''-em''''' after a consonant) with the plural being '''''-sem''''' ('''''-esem''''' after a consonant) or with the preposition '''''em'''''.\n\nThe genitive is formed with the ending '''''-n''''' ('''''-en''''' after a consonant) with the plural being '''''-sen''''' ('''''-esen''''' after a consonant) or with the preposition '''''de'''''.\n\nOther cases are formed with prepositions.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAll adjectives end in '''''-i''''', but this may be dropped if it is easy enough to pronounce and no confusion will be caused. Adjectives precede the noun qualified. Adjectives do not agree with the noun but may be given noun endings if there is no noun present to receive them.\n\nComparative adjectives are formed by placing various particles (''plu, tam,'' and ''min'') in front of the adjective receiving the comparison. Likewise, the superlative particles (''maxim'' and ''minim'') precede the adjective. The adjective does not receive an inflection to its ending.\n\n===Adverbs===\nAn adjective is converted to a corresponding adverb by adding '''''-m''''' after the '''''-i''''' ending of the adjective.\n\nComparative and superlative adverbs are formed in the same manner as comparative and superlative adjectives: by placing a specific particle before the adverb receiving the comparison.\n\n==Vocabulary==\n===Affixes===\nSee the [[b:Novial/Hound Appendix 1|Table of Prefixes]] and [[b:Novial/Hound Appendix 2|Table of Suffixes]] at the Novial Wikibook.\n\n==Novial compared to Esperanto and Ido==\n{{See also|Comparison between Esperanto and Novial|Comparison between Ido and Novial}}\n\nJespersen was a professional linguist, unlike Esperanto's creator.{{POV-inline|date=September 2019}} He disliked the arbitrary and artificial character that he found in Esperanto and Ido.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Additionally, he objected to those languages' [[inflection]]al systems, which he found needlessly complex. He sought to make Novial at once euphonious and regular while also preserving useful structures from natural languages.\n\nIn Novial:\n* Syntax is largely a matter of word order, as in [[English language|English]] and modern [[Scandinavian language]]s. There is no obligatory [[Accusative case|accusative]] marker as in Esperanto, but the accusative may optionally be marked with either an accusative ending or an accusative preposition.\n* A [[genitive]] or [[possessive case]] is available as an alternative to the preposition ''de''. This is based on Jespersen's observation that many modern languages have lost complex noun inflections, yet retain a possessive form.\n* Auxiliary particles express most [[verb]] [[Grammatical tense|tenses]]. An inflectional ending is available as a shorthand for the simple [[past tense]].\n\nA major difference between Novial and Esperanto/Ido concerns [[noun]] endings. Jespersen rejected a single vowel to terminate all nouns (-o in Esperanto/Ido), finding it unnatural and potentially confusing. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/54694/54694-h/54694-h.htm|title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of International Language and Science}}</ref> Instead, Novial nouns may end in ''-o'', ''-a'', ''-e'', or ''-u'' or ''-um''. These endings may be taken to indicate natural sex according to the custom in Romance languages. Also there is no grammatical gender or requirement for [[adjective]]s to agree with nouns.\n\n==Language sample for comparison==\nHere is [[the Lord's Prayer]] in Novial and several related languages:\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Novial version:'''\n|'''[[Esperanto]] version:'''\n|'''[[Ido (language)|Ido]] version:'''\n|'''[[Latin]] version:'''\n|-\n|\nNusen Patre, kel es in siele,<br/>\nmey vun nome bli sanktifika,<br/>\nmey vun regno veni;<br/>\nmey on fa vun volio<br/>\nkom in siele anke sur tere.<br/>\nDona a nus disdi li omnidiali pane,<br/>\ne pardona a nus nusen ofensos,<br/>\nkom anke nus pardona a nusen ofensantes,<br/>\ne non dukte nus en tentatione,<br/>\nma liberisa nus fro malu.<br/>\nAmen.\n|\nPatro nia, kiu estas en la \u0109ielo,<br/>\nVia nomo estu sanktigita.<br/>\nVenu Via regno,<br/>\nplenumi\u011du Via volo,<br/>\nkiel en la \u0109ielo, tiel anka\u016d sur la tero.<br/>\nNian panon \u0109iutagan donu al ni hodia\u016d.<br/>\nKaj pardonu al ni niajn \u015duldojn,<br/>\nkiel anka\u016d ni pardonas al niaj \u015duldantoj.<br/>\nKaj ne konduku nin en tenton,<br/>\nsed liberigu nin de la malbono.<br/>\nAmen.\n|\nPatro nia, qua esas en la cielo,<br/>\ntua nomo santigesez;<br/>\ntua regno advenez;<br/>\ntua volo facesez<br/>\nquale en la cielo tale anke sur la tero.<br/>\nDonez a ni cadie l'omnadia pano,<br/>\ne pardonez a ni nia ofensi,<br/>\nquale anke ni pardonas a nia ofensanti,<br/>\ne ne duktez ni aden la tento,<br/>\nma liberigez ni del malajo.<br/>\nAmen.\n|\nPater noster, qui es in caelis:<br/>\nsanctificetur Nomen Tuum;<br/>\nadveniat Regnum Tuum;<br/>\nfiat voluntas Tua, <br/>\nsicut in caelo, et in terra.<br/>\nPanem nostrum cotidianum da nobis hodie;<br/>\net dimitte nobis debita nostra,<br/>\nSicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris;<br/>\net ne nos inducas in tentationem;<br/>\nsed libera nos a Malo.<br/>\nAmen.\n|}\n\n==Criticism==\nAs Jespersen relates in his autobiography, in 1934 he proposed an orthographic reform to Novial, which displeased a part of the users. Jespersen abandoned the essential principle of ''one sound, one letter'' :<ref>Jespersen, Otto (1995 [1938]). ''A linguist\u2019s life: an English translation of Otto Jerpersen\u2019s autobiography'' [''En Sprogmands Levned''] ''with notes, photos and a bibliography''. Edited by Arne Juul, Hans F. Nielsen, J\u00f8rgen Erik Nielsen. Odense: Odense University Press. {{ISBN|87-7838-132-0}}.</ref>\n\n{{quotation|I proposed some not inconsiderable amendments, especially by introducing an \"orthographic\" Novial alongside the original phonetically written language. (...) Thus the sound [k], besides being represented by the letters ''k'' and ''q'' and the first part of ''x'', also acquired the new sign ''c'' (before ''a, o, u'' and consonants), a practice with which nearly all Europeans, Americans, and Australians are familiar from childhood. (...) I know that this orthographic form has displeased several of Novial's old and faithful friends, but it is my impression that many others have applauded it.|Otto Jespersen (1995 [1938], pp. 227\u20138)}}\n\nSome of Jespersen's colleagues among philologists jokingly referred to Novial as ''Jesperanto'', combining his surname with [[Esperanto]], the prototypical auxiliary language.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Comparison between Esperanto and Novial]]\n* [[Comparison between Ido and Novial]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{InterWiki|code=nov}}\n{{wiktionary|Novial}}\n{{wikibooks}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091027023518/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3141/novial.html  A summary of 1928 Novial]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20030201065247/http://www.cs.brown.edu/~dpb/novial/n30grammar.html A summary of the 1930 version]\n* [http://www.feedbooks.com/userbook/14934/an-international-language ''An International Language''] (1928) by Otto Jespersen\n* [http://www.blahedo.org/novial/novial98.html Novial{{nbsp}}\u201998]\n* [https://sites.google.com/site/noviallexike/novial-lexike-1930 Novial Lexike: International Dictionary] by Otto Jespersen, 1930\n{{Constructed languages}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Novial| ]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages]]\n[[Category:Constructed languages introduced in the 1920s]]\n[[Category:1928 introductions]]\n", "name_user": "Soumya-8974", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOrthography", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novial"}
