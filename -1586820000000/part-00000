A relatively minor battle, it is best remembered for the death of [[John Hampden]], who died of wounds six days later.     \n\nRiding through the night of 17 to 18 June, [[Cavalier|Royalist]] cavalry under [[Prince Rupert]] raided [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] positions around [[Chinnor]]. As they returned to [[Oxford]], they were pursued by cavalry under Hampden and Major John Gunter; at [[Chalgrove]], Rupert led a counter attack, which scattered his opponents before the main force arrived under Sir [[Philip Stapleton]]; in the course of this, Hampden was wounded.  \n\nCombined with his failure to capitalise on the [[Siege_of_Reading|capture of Reading]], the defeat led to criticism of the   [[Robert_Devereux,_3rd_Earl_of_Essex|Earl of Essex]], commander of the Parliamentary army.

For the Royalists, this meant fortifying their new capital in [[Oxford]], and connecting areas of support in England and Wales; Parliament focused on consolidating control of the areas they already held.

Hurry's information revealed Essex had concentrated his troops in the north, to protect the convoy, leaving his southern positions exposed.

Having inflicted 50 casualties, as well as capturing prisoners and stores, Prince Rupert decided to withdraw before his line of retreat was cut; by 6:30 am, his forces were on the road back to Oxford.{{sfn|Royle|2004|p=229}} \n\nWhile three troops under Hampden and Major John Gunter maintained contact with the Royalists, the local commander at [[Thame]], Sir [[Philip Stapleton]], hastily pulled together a force to attack them. Several senior officers, supposedly in Thame to collect their regiments' wages, helped him form a number of [[ad hoc]] units; having collected around 700 men, Stapleton set out in pursuit.{{sfn|Lester|Lester|2015|p=34}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:The Bridleway to Chalgrove - geograph.org.uk - 93360.jpg|thumb|right|Route taken by the Royalist infantry along the bridleway from Golder Hill to [[Easington, South Oxfordshire|Easington]]]]\nWith Sir Henry Lunsford's infantry leading the way, the Royalists made slow progress due to their prisoners and loot, with their column spread out along two miles. By 8:30 am, the rearguard was in contact with Hampden and Gunter, who had been joined by 100 dragoons under [[John_Dalbier|Colonel Dalbier]], an experienced German mercenary. Realising he could not outrun his pursuers, Rupert ordered Lunsford to keep moving, and secure the bridge at [[Chiselhampton]].{{sfn|Stevenson|Carter|1973|p=348}} \n\nThis took them along a bridleway, bounded by a \u2018Great Hedge\u2019, a double line of thick, shoulder-high hedgerows that could not be flanked. [[Thomas_Wentworth,_5th_Baron_Wentworth|Lord Wentworth]]'s dragoons set up an ambush further along the hedgerow (see Map), while Rupert's cavalry formed up in an open field. By now, the Parliamentary forces consisted of around 200 cavalry, plus the dragoons.{{sfn|Stevenson|Carter|1973|p=349}}\n\nDalbier moved his dragoons up to the hedge, and opened fire on the Royalist cavalry; this prompted Prince Rupert into an attack, allegedly leaping the hedge while the rest of his men made their way around. Dalbier withdrew, reinforced by Hampden and Gunter; the Parliamentary troops initially held their ground, but were heavily outnumbered, and broke.

By mid-June, the convoy was at [[Newark-on-Trent]]; Chalgrove ended any hopes of an interception, and it entered Oxford in early July. More importantly, the Royalists established a psychological edge over their opponents, confirmed on 25 June when Hurry attacked [[High_Wycombe|Wycombe]]. Essex withdrew from [[Oxfordshire]], allowing Prince Rupert to support operations in the west, culminating in the [[Storming_of_Bristol|capture of Bristol]] on 26 July.{{sfn|Wedgwood|1958|pp=233-234}}\n\nArguably the greatest loss was that of Hampden;
