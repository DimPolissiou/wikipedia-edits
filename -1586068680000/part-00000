The group is notable for its energetic fusion of Eastern and Western musical forms, for its outspoken political stance, and for its strong Islamic affiliation and advocacy.

This was followed by 1999's ''Why America Will Go to Hell'' and the world-music-inspired ''There Shall Be Love!'' (2001). In 2003, Fun-Da-Mental released the ''Voice of Mass Destruction'' EP.\n\nThe release of the album into a tense political climate led to harsh criticism of, and verbal attacks on, Nawaz and Fun-Da-Mental. ''[[The Observer]]'''s review of the album ''All is War (The Benefits of G-Had)'' said \"Strip away the outrage, then, and what's left is an album pieced together with great consideration. To provoke not just a reaction but thought and debate.\"<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/10bestcds/story/0,,1818107,00.html \"Fun-Da-Mental, All is War\"], Chris Campion, ''[[The Observer]]'', 16 July 2006.</ref>\n\n==Musical style==\nFun-Da-Mental's music combines and juxtaposes Eastern and Western musical and cultural influences. These include British dance club electronics and American militant hip-hop inspirations, plus [[Music of India|Indian]], [[Afro-Caribbean music|Afro-Caribbean]], and [[worldbeat]] [[Sampling (music)|samples]]. The band's music also includes \"a vast mix of Indian classical and popular film music, Moroccan Eastern drum beats, [[Qawwali]] sounds, Islamic chants, and the interweaving of dialogue from famous Hindi movies.\"<ref>Sharma, Sanjay. \"Noisy Asians or 'Asian Noise'?\"</ref>\n\nMusically, Fun-Da-Mental have borrowed extensive samples from Indian film music, particularly from the string sections.  Through their juxtaposition with hip-hop rhythm tracks and angry raps, such samples are reconfigured, and a new hybrid Asian identity is emphasised.  The band's use of \"Indian Sounds\" is symbolic of certain experiences for second-generation British Asians.<ref name=autogenerated3>Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

Fun-Da-Mental frequently sample the voices and rallying speeches of historically significant protest leaders from the past such as [[Gandhi]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Louis Farrakhan]] and the [[Black Panthers]]. The group have also promoted the merits of militancy and self-defense through the lyrics of their songs.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Ed.

Exploring the position that Muslims are oppressed within Western culture because of their religion, the group aims to express the hardships and rejection which Western Muslims experience at the hands of their governments, and to assert though their lyrics the beauty of being Muslim. Nawaz has also directly incorporated quotations from the [[Qur'an]] into Fun-Da-Mental tracks. The band's symbol is a crescent, which not only invokes the sense of Islam but also of the Pakistani flag. Notably, Aki Nawaz's mother was one of the leading activists for [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s [[Pakistan Peoples Party]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n{{Quote box\n| bgcolor=#EEEEEE\n| quoted=true\n| quote  =\"\"It's always been about destroying all the stereotypical ideas about us and others and fighting against the preconceived misconceptions of a host society that has been poisoned by the past\"\n| source =Aki Nawaz<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n| width  =30%\n| qalign =center\n| salign =center\n| align  =left\n}}Fun-Da-Mental has also been one of the first British music groups to actively and fiercely defend the Muslim community by example. In particular, Fun-Da-Mental have set out to appeal to and voice the concerns of the alienated Muslim youth of British towns such as Bradford (Nawaz's birthplace and the original hometown of the group). Consequently, Fun-Da-mental has reached a significant number of British Muslim youths who identify with the situations and topics covered in the group's lyrics, slogans and presentation.<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://muslimcafe.tv/pages/guests.php?guest=36|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322023214/http://muslimcafe.tv/pages/guests.php?guest=36|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 March 2008|title=Muslim Cafe - guest list - Aki Nawaz - \u00a0Aki Nawaz a.k.a. Propa-Gandhi is a British rapper and musician, lead singer of the punk rap band Fun-Da-Mental. Born in Pakistan, he grew up in Bradford in the 1970s, and is best known for his controversial lyrics relating to the immorality of Western governments and suicide bombers. In the 1980s, using his proper name Haq Qureshi, he played drums with the rock band Southern Death Cult, a forerunner to The Cult, with Ian Astbury on vocals. In 1991 Nawaz went on to found the Islamic rap group Fun-Da-Mental.In 2006, when Fun-Da-Mental\u2019s record All is War was about to be released through his own Nation Records, two company directors from his distributor Beggar's Banquet Records, Martin Mills and Andrew Heath, threatened to resign. The record was finally released on August 7th 2006 as a download album.Aki is a regular media commentator and speaker at anti-war and Muslim events.|date=22 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nAs is common within any culture with a hybrid demographic, British-born youths of Islamic heritage were struggling to fit into either aspect of their given identity and were trying to find a place for themselves. Fun-Da-Mental made this hybrid identity accessible, and allowed the youth to explore themselves. They countered the strict views and opinions of mosque scholars and Muslim community leaders with their own political manifesto. \"Fun-Da-Mental's expressions of pride in Islam appealed to Muslim youth who had been raised on British popular culture yet also felt wounded by British Islamophobia.\"<ref name=autogenerated4>Swedenburg, Ted. \"Islamic Hip-hop vs. Islamophobia.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 57\u201385. Middletown: Wesleyan University Press, 2001.</ref>\n\nIslam has always played a large role in Fun-Da-Mental's anti-racist campaign lyrics. The group has taken on a role as one of the leading forces for keeping issues about the Asian population in the public eye. Fun-Da-Mental members appear actively on various television shows in the UK to participate in debate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myspace.com/originalfundamental|title=fun-da-mental &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|website=Myspace.com}}</ref>\n\nFun-Da-Mental's work has been compared to that of the [[Nation of Islam]] in its combination of pro-black (or pro-non-white) assertion and condemnation of racism. The group has taken direct inspiration from several black activists in the United States and their reassertion of history. A particular inspiration was Malcolm X, who notably became a Muslim as part of his political journey: the group sometimes cite his pronouncement that  \"I am a soldier named Alaha, so put down the cross and pick up the X\". In the song \"President Propaganda\", Fun-Da-Mental's lyrics rely on the rhetoric of the [[Nation of Islam]] to send anti-Western messages. The lines \"you had us whipped, raped, and lynched/Took away the Quran, you gave us the Bible\" allude to issues such as slavery and religious persecution.<ref name=autogenerated6>Sharma, Sanjay. \"Noisy Asians or 'Asian Noise'?\" In Disorienting Rhythms: The Politics of the New Asian Dance Music, ed.

This was followed by 1999's ''Why America Will Go to Hell'' and the world-music-inspired ''There Shall Be Love!'' (2001). In 2003, Fun-Da-Mental released the ''Voice of Mass Destruction'' EP.\n\nThe release of the album into a tense political climate led to harsh criticism of, and verbal attacks on, Nawaz and Fun-Da-Mental. ''[[The Observer]]'''s review of the album ''All is War (The Benefits of G-Had)'' said \"Strip away the outrage, then, and what's left is an album pieced together with great consideration. To provoke not just a reaction but thought and debate.\"<ref>[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/10bestcds/story/0,,1818107,00.html \"Fun-Da-Mental, All is War\"], Chris Campion, ''[[The Observer]]'', 16 July 2006.</ref>\n\n==Musical style==\nFun-Da-Mental's music combines and juxtaposes Eastern and Western musical and cultural influences. These include British dance club electronics and American militant hip-hop inspirations, plus [[Music of India|Indian]], [[Afro-Caribbean music|Afro-Caribbean]], and [[worldbeat]] [[Sampling (music)|samples]]. The band's music also includes \"a vast mix of Indian classical and popular film music, Moroccan Eastern drum beats, [[Qawwali]] sounds, Islamic chants, and the interweaving of dialogue from famous Hindi movies.\"<ref>Sharma, Sanjay. \"Noisy Asians or 'Asian Noise'?\"</ref>\n\nMusically, Fun-Da-Mental have borrowed extensive samples from Indian film music, particularly from the string sections.  Through their juxtaposition with hip-hop rhythm tracks and angry raps, such samples are reconfigured, and a new hybrid Asian identity is emphasised.  The band's use of \"Indian Sounds\" is symbolic of certain experiences for second-generation British Asians.<ref name=autogenerated3>Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

Fun-Da-Mental frequently sample the voices and rallying speeches of historically significant protest leaders from the past such as [[Gandhi]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Louis Farrakhan]] and the [[Black Panthers]].

Exploring the position that Muslims are oppressed within Western culture because of their religion, the group aims to express the hardships and rejection which Western Muslims experience at the hands of their governments, and to assert though their lyrics the beauty of being Muslim. Nawaz has also directly incorporated quotations from the [[Qur'an]] into Fun-Da-Mental tracks. The band's symbol is a crescent, which not only invokes the sense of Islam but also of the Pakistani flag. Notably, Aki Nawaz's mother was one of the leading activists for [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s [[Pakistan Peoples Party]].<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\n{{Quote box\n| bgcolor=#EEEEEE\n| quoted=true\n| quote  =\"\"It's always been about destroying all the stereotypical ideas about us and others and fighting against the preconceived misconceptions of a host society that has been poisoned by the past\"\n| source =Aki Nawaz<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n| width  =30%\n| qalign =center\n| salign =center\n| align  =left\n}}Fun-Da-Mental has also been one of the first British music groups to actively and fiercely defend the Muslim community by example. In particular, Fun-Da-Mental have set out to appeal to and voice the concerns of the alienated Muslim youth of British towns such as Bradford (Nawaz's birthplace and the original hometown of the group). Consequently, Fun-Da-mental has reached a significant number of British Muslim youths who identify with the situations and topics covered in the group's lyrics, slogans and presentation.<ref name=autogenerated3 /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://muslimcafe.tv/pages/guests.php?guest=36|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322023214/http://muslimcafe.tv/pages/guests.php?guest=36|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 March 2008|title=Muslim Cafe - guest list - Aki Nawaz - \u00a0Aki Nawaz a.k.a. Propa-Gandhi is a British rapper and musician, lead singer of the punk rap band Fun-Da-Mental. Born in Pakistan, he grew up in Bradford in the 1970s, and is best known for his controversial lyrics relating to the immorality of Western governments and suicide bombers. In the 1980s, using his proper name Haq Qureshi, he played drums with the rock band Southern Death Cult, a forerunner to The Cult, with Ian Astbury on vocals. In 1991 Nawaz went on to found the Islamic rap group Fun-Da-Mental.In 2006, when Fun-Da-Mental\u2019s record All is War was about to be released through his own Nation Records, two company directors from his distributor Beggar's Banquet Records, Martin Mills and Andrew Heath, threatened to resign. The record was finally released on August 7th 2006 as a download album.Aki is a regular media commentator and speaker at anti-war and Muslim events.|date=22 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nAs is common within any culture with a hybrid demographic, British-born youths of Islamic heritage were struggling to fit into either aspect of their given identity and were trying to find a place for themselves. Fun-Da-Mental made this hybrid identity accessible, and allowed the youth to explore themselves. They countered the strict views and opinions of mosque scholars and Muslim community leaders with their own political manifesto. \"Fun-Da-Mental's expressions of pride in Islam appealed to Muslim youth who had been raised on British popular culture yet also felt wounded by British Islamophobia.\"<ref name=autogenerated4>Swedenburg, Ted. \"Islamic Hip-hop vs. Islamophobia.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 57\u201385.

The group has taken on a role as one of the leading forces for keeping issues about the Asian population in the public eye. Fun-Da-Mental members appear actively on various television shows in the UK to participate in debate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myspace.com/originalfundamental|title=fun-da-mental &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|website=Myspace.com}}</ref>\n\nFun-Da-Mental's work has been compared to that of the [[Nation of Islam]] in its combination of pro-black (or pro-non-white) assertion and condemnation of racism. The group has taken direct inspiration from several black activists in the United States and their reassertion of history. A particular inspiration was Malcolm X, who notably became a Muslim as part of his political journey: the group sometimes cite his pronouncement that  \"I am a soldier named Alaha, so put down the cross and pick up the X\". In the song \"President Propaganda\", Fun-Da-Mental's lyrics rely on the rhetoric of the [[Nation of Islam]] to send anti-Western messages. The lines \"you had us whipped, raped, and lynched/Took away the Quran, you gave us the Bible\" allude to issues such as slavery and religious persecution.<ref name=autogenerated6>Sharma, Sanjay. \"Noisy Asians or 'Asian Noise'?\" In Disorienting Rhythms: The Politics of the New Asian Dance Music, ed.

Archaeological evidence of Aboriginal camp sites have been found on the upper terraces of the Macleay and Apsley rivers.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[John Oxley]], failed to realize the potential of this river in 1820 when he did not navigate far enough up the river to see the magnificent stands of timber and the fertile land. The river was vaguely referred to as the New River from descriptions given by Aborigines. In 1826 Captain Wright travelled overland from Port Macquarie and explored to the head of navigation at Belgrave Falls, a series of rapids to the west of the present town of Kempsey. Then called Wrights River, Major [[Archibald Clunes Innes]], Commandant of Port Macquarie Penal Settlement, sent the first government gang of Australian red cedar (''[[Toona ciliata]]'') cutters to work here in 1827.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nMore cedar camps were established on the Macleay during the 1830s and the area was also a haven for escaped convicts. By 1841, about 200 cutters were working on the river area, where violence and theft of logs was not uncommon. Demand and prices dropped in 1842 and cutting along the Macleay diminished although it continued in the upper tributaries. When Europeans arrived in the area around the 1820s the river mouth was just south of Grassy Head, and almost a mile wide with a sand spit in the middle.  The small town of Stuarts Point was established on the river just inside to serve arriving ships.<ref>{{cite book |title=Valley of the Macleay |author=Neil, Marie H |year=1972 |isbn=0-85587-037-0 |chapter=Chapters 1 and 10}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal strip extending from South West Rocks to Grassy Head is a wide delta with various channels connected to the river.  Around 1885 English marine engineer John Coode advised on improvements to various rivers and ports in Australia, including the Macleay.  The Department of Public Works prepared four plans for improvements to the mouth, Coode favoured improving the existing entrance.

Archaeological evidence of Aboriginal camp sites have been found on the upper terraces of the Macleay and Apsley rivers.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n[[John Oxley]], failed to realize the potential of this river in 1820 when he did not navigate far enough up the river to see the magnificent stands of timber and the fertile land. The river was vaguely referred to as the New River from descriptions given by Aborigines. In 1826 Captain Wright travelled overland from Port Macquarie and explored to the head of navigation at Belgrave Falls, a series of rapids to the west of the present town of Kempsey. Then called Wrights River, Major [[Archibald Clunes Innes]], Commandant of Port Macquarie Penal Settlement, sent the first government gang of Australian red cedar (''[[Toona ciliata]]'') cutters to work here in 1827.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nMore cedar camps were established on the Macleay during the 1830s and the area was also a haven for escaped convicts. By 1841, about 200 cutters were working on the river area, where violence and theft of logs was not uncommon. Demand and prices dropped in 1842 and cutting along the Macleay diminished although it continued in the upper tributaries. When Europeans arrived in the area around the 1820s the river mouth was just south of Grassy Head, and almost a mile wide with a sand spit in the middle.  The small town of Stuarts Point was established on the river just inside to serve arriving ships.<ref>{{cite book |title=Valley of the Macleay |author=Neil, Marie H |year=1972 |isbn=0-85587-037-0 |chapter=Chapters 1 and 10}}</ref>\n\nThe coastal strip extending from South West Rocks to Grassy Head is a wide delta with various channels connected to the river.  Around 1885 English marine engineer John Coode advised on improvements to various rivers and ports in Australia, including the Macleay.  The Department of Public Works prepared four plans for improvements to the mouth, Coode favoured improving the existing entrance.  In 1893 a flood enlarged an opening near South West Rocks and the department elected to improve that, called the New Entrance, though Coode had thought it not enough to drain all the waters of the district. Work on the new entrance commenced in April 1896, improving the channel and adding training walls. A new [[pilot station]] was built in 1902, establishing the town of [[South West Rocks, New South Wales|South West Rocks]]. Work was completed in 1906.

Gus claims he then attempted to cover for the loss by replacing the cocaine with local, inferior meth. Gus's story explains events of which Lalo is aware, including Werner's escape and death. Lalo accepts Gus's version of events and apology, but remains suspicious as the cover story does not gel with information that Werner gave him on the phone. Juan privately warns Lalo that [[Don Eladio Vuente]] and the cartel trust Gus, or at least consider him a valuable earner, so Lalo should consider the matter closed.

Gus claims he then attempted to cover for the loss by replacing the cocaine with local, inferior meth. Gus's story explains events of which Lalo is aware, including Werner's escape and death. Lalo accepts Gus's version of events and apology, but remains suspicious as the cover story does not gel with information that Werner gave him on the phone. Juan privately warns Lalo that [[Don Eladio Vuente]] and the cartel trust Gus, or at least consider him a valuable earner, so Lalo should consider the matter closed. Lalo later receives confirmation from Hector that Gus enjoys cartel protection as long as he brings in money. Because of Lalo's suspicions, Gus shuts down work on his underground meth lab and Mike sends Werner's men home, paid in full for the half-completed job and warned to remain silent.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Magic Man |episode-link=Magic Man (Better Call Saul) |series=Better Call Saul |series-link=Better Call Saul |network=[[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] |date=February 23, 2020 |season=5 |number=1}}</ref>\n\nGus demands that Nacho find a way to gain Lalo's trust and start passing inside information about the Salamancas.

The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be in the Island include [[Lagos Island]], [[Eti-Osa]]. The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include [[Ikoyi]] and [[Victoria Island (Nigeria)|Victoria Island]]. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland.

Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: [[Agege]], [[Amuwo Odofin]], [[Mushin, Lagos|Mushin]], [[Oshodi-Isolo]] and [[Ikeja]] (site of [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]] and the capital of Lagos State).\n\nMajor Areas on the mainland include [[Ebute Metta]], [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]] and [[Ejigbo, Lagos|Ejigbo]]. Some rivers, like [[Badagry]] Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.\n\n===Climate===\nLagos experiences a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The wet season starts in April and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in March. The wettest month is June with precipitation total {{convert|315.5|mm}}, while the driest month is January with precipitation total {{convert|13.2|mm}}.\n\nLocated near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging {{cvt|28.3|-|32.9|C|F}}. Lagos shares the seasons of the Southern Hemisphere, with summer highs in March, daily range {{cvt|32.9|-|24.1|C|F}}, and warm winters in August, ranging {{cvt|28.3|-|21.8|C|F}} as the daily average.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Lagos ([[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]]) MMIA   1961\u20131990, extremes: 1886\u2013present\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 40.0\n|Feb record high C = 37.1\n|Mar record high C = 37.0\n|Apr record high C = 39.6\n|May record high C = 37.0\n|Jun record high C = 37.6\n|Jul record high C = 33.2\n|Aug record high C = 33.0\n|Sep record high C = 33.2\n|Oct record high C = 33.7\n|Nov record high C = 39.9\n|Dec record high C = 36.4\n|year record high C = 40.0\n|Jan high C = 32.2\n|Feb high C = 33.2\n|Mar high C = 32.9\n|Apr high C = 32.2\n|May high C = 30.9\n|Jun high C = 29.3\n|Jul high C = 28.2\n|Aug high C = 28.3\n|Sep high C = 28.9\n|Oct high C = 30.3\n|Nov high C = 31.4\n|Dec high C = 31.8\n|year high C = 30.8\n|Jan mean C = 27.3\n|Feb mean C = 28.4\n|Mar mean C = 28.5\n|Apr mean C = 28.0\n|May mean C = 27.0\n|Jun mean C = 25.6\n|Jul mean C = 25.2\n|Aug mean C = 25.0\n|Sep mean C = 25.5\n|Oct mean C = 26.4\n|Nov mean C = 27.2\n|Dec mean C = 27.2\n|year mean C = 26.8\n|Jan low C = 22.4\n|Feb low C = 23.7\n|Mar low C = 24.1\n|Apr low C = 23.7\n|May low C = 23.2\n|Jun low C = 21.9\n|Jul low C = 22.3\n|Aug low C = 21.8\n|Sep low C = 22.1\n|Oct low C = 22.4\n|Nov low C = 23.0\n|Dec low C = 22.5\n|year low C = 22.8\n|Jan record low C = 12.6\n|Feb record low C = 16.1\n|Mar record low C = 14.0\n|Apr record low C = 14.9\n|May record low C = 20.0\n|Jun record low C = 21.2\n|Jul record low C = 15.0\n|Aug record low C = 19.0\n|Sep record low C = 13.0\n|Oct record low C = 17.9\n|Nov record low C = 11.1\n|Dec record low C = 11.6\n|year record low C = 11.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 13.2\n|Feb precipitation mm = 40.6\n|Mar precipitation mm = 84.3\n|Apr precipitation mm = 146.3\n|May precipitation mm = 202.4\n|Jun precipitation mm = 315.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 243.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 121.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 160.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 125.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 39.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 14.8\n|year precipitation mm = 1506.6\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 1.5\n|Feb precipitation days = 2.8\n|Mar precipitation days = 6.6\n|Apr precipitation days = 9.0\n|May precipitation days = 12.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 16.2\n|Jul precipitation days = 13.2\n|Aug precipitation days = 11.6\n|Sep precipitation days = 12.7\n|Oct precipitation days = 11.2\n|Nov precipitation days = 4.9\n|Dec precipitation days = 2.1\n|year precipitation days = 104.3\n|Jan humidity = 81\n|Feb humidity = 79\n|Mar humidity = 76\n|Apr humidity = 82\n|May humidity = 84\n|Jun humidity = 87\n|Jul humidity = 87\n|Aug humidity = 85\n|Sep humidity = 86\n|Oct humidity = 87\n|Nov humidity = 84\n|Dec humidity = 82\n|year humidity = 83\n|Jan sun = 164.3\n|Feb sun = 168.0\n|Mar sun = 173.6\n|Apr sun = 180.0\n|May sun = 176.7\n|Jun sun = 114.0\n|Jul sun = 99.2\n|Aug sun = 108.5\n|Sep sun = 114.0\n|Oct sun = 167.4\n|Nov sun = 186.0\n|Dec sun = 192.2\n|year sun = 1843.9\n| source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (humidity, 1952\u20131967),<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_652010_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Lagos-Ikeja (Flugh.) / Nigeria\n| publisher = Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure\n| accessdate = 7 July 2016}}</ref> NOAA (sun)<ref name = NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG__I/NI/65201.TXT\n| title = Lagos Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 7 July 2016}}</ref> \n|source 2 = Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web \n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=1769\n| title = Station Murtala\n| publisher = Meteo Climat \n| language = French \n| accessdate = 7 July 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{Main|Architecture of Lagos}}\n[[File:Lagos (Nigeria).jpg|thumb|left| Lagos skyline]]\n[[File:Lekki Conservation Center, Canopy walk.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lekki Conservation Centre]] canopy walk]]\n\nLagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria.

The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several [[Local Government Areas in Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (most notably Lagos Island LGA, [[Lagos Mainland|Lagos Mainland LGA]] and [[Eti-Osa|Eti-Osa LGA]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Public Admin.

In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present day \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\", also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\". The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.\n\nBy 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a [[megacity]] status. This much larger area is referred to as \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\" or \"Lagos Megacity Region\", which is a continuous built up land area of additional {{convert|1,535.4|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}, comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and beyond northern limits, spilling into the LGAs in adjoining [[Ogun State]].

The MMIA is Nigeria's premier international air gateway. The airport's history dates back to colonial times, around the time of the Second World War. The current international airport terminal was built and commissioned over 40 years ago, in 1978. The terminal opened officially March 15, 1979. The airport had been known simply as the Lagos International Airport. It was, however, renamed for the late Nigerian Head of State, General Murtala Muhammed, who died in 1976.\n\nThe airport terminal has been renovated several times since the 1970s but its most radical makeover began in 2013, following the launch of the Federal government's multi-billion naira Remodelling/ Rehabilitation Programme for its airports nationwide. Under the re-modeling work there, by late in 2014, the MMlA lounge area had been expanded to four times its previous size and new passenger handling conveyor systems installed which can handle over 1,000 passengers per hour.\n\nA second airport, [[Lekki-Epe International Airport]] is proposed.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{main category|People from Lagos}}\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Please keep the list in alphabetical order by LAST NAME \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n*[[Israel Adesanya]], UFC Middle weight champion\n*[[Nelson Agholor]], Professional [[American football]] player, [[Super Bowl 52]] Champion with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in 2018\n*[[Rilwan Akiolu]], Oba (traditional ruler) of Lagos \n*[[Akinwunmi Ambode]], former Governor of Lagos state\n*[[Abike Dabiri]], Chairman/Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian Diaspora Commission\n*[[Agbani Darego]], Miss Nigeria 2001, Semifinalist Miss Universe 2001 and Miss World 2001\n*[[Buchi Emecheta]], novelist\n*[[Babatunde Fashola]], Former Governor of Lagos and current Minister of Power, Works and Housing\n*[[Bode George]], Politician\n*[[Israel Idonije]], Professional [[American football]] player, Chicago Bears 2003\u20132013, Detroit Lions 2013\n*[[Hakeem Olajuwon]], professional basketball player\n*[[Yemi Osinbajo]], politician, lawyer and current Vice-President of Nigeria \n*[[Babajide Sanwo-Olu]], Governor of Lagos State\n*[[Bola Tinubu]], Former Governor of Lagos State\n*[[Funsho Williams]], politician and one time aspirant to the office of Lagos state governor\n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Only add a person to this list if they already have their own article on the English Wikipedia \u2666\u2666\u2666---> \n<!---\u2666\u2666\u2666 Please keep the list in alphabetical order by LAST NAME \u2666\u2666\u2666--->\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Africa#Nigeria|l1=List of twin towns and sister cities in Nigeria}}\n\nLagos is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref name=SC>{{cite web |url=http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/Lagos,%20Nigeria |publisher=SisterCities International |title=Lagos, Nigeria |location=Washington DC, USA |accessdate=2015-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171311/http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/Lagos,%20Nigeria |archive-date=14 July 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Gary, Indiana]], United States, since 1991<ref name=SC/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/19703233/ |date=25 November 1991 |title=The Kokomo Tribune from Kokomo, Indiana \u00b7 Page 21 |journal=The Kokomo Tribune |location=Kokomo, Indiana |page=21 |format=PDF |accessdate=2015-03-28 |via=Newspapers.com (Lindon, UT, USA)}}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Atlanta, Georgia]], United States, since 1974<ref name=SC/>\n*{{flagicon|ROM}} [[Bucharest]], Romania<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adevarul.ro/news/bucuresti/cu-infratit-bucurestiult-1_50bdf86b7c42d5a663d0ec3e/index.html |title=Cu cine este \u00eenfr\u0103\u021bit Bucure\u0219tiul? |work=[[Adev\u0103rul]] |date=21 February 2011 |language=Romanian}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of largest cities]]\n*[[List of Governors of Lagos State]]\n\n{{Portal bar|Nigeria|Africa|Geography}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n149. ^https://web.archive.org/web/20170623050548/http://www.faan.gov.ng/mmia/\n\n150. ^https://mypostalcode.com.ng/\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Alastair Leithead|Leithead, Alastair]] (August 2017).

The Island is mainly a collection of islands that are separated from each other by creeks of varying sizes and are connected together by bridges. The smaller sections of some creeks have been dredged and built over. This part of Lagos is the area where most business activities and entertainment events in Lagos takes place. It also houses most of the upscale residential areas in Lagos. The Local Government Areas (LGAs) that are considered to be in the Island include [[Lagos Island]], [[Eti-Osa]]. The major upscale island neighbourhoods within these LGAs include [[Ikoyi]] and [[Victoria Island (Nigeria)|Victoria Island]]. Three major bridges join the island to the mainland. They are the [[Carter Bridge]], which starts from Iddo; the [[Eko Bridge]] (formerly called the Second Mainland Bridge); and the [[Third Mainland Bridge]], which passes through densely populated mainland suburbs to the Lagos Lagoon.\n\n=====Lagos Island=====\n\n{{Main|Lagos Island}}\n[[File:2010 Lagos Nigeria 5284107494.jpg|thumb|upright|Lagos Marina]]\nLagos Island contains a [[central business district]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://limge.org/editorials.html|title=The lagos pressure group on the environment|publisher=Limge Online|accessdate=4 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510195227/http://limge.org/editorials.html|archivedate=10 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This district is characterized by high-rise buildings.

It borders around the idumota and Balogun markets and houses major Banking institutions. Though formerly in a derelict condition, Lagos Island's [[Tinubu Square]] is a site of historical importance; it was here that the Amalgamation Ceremony that unified the North and South [[protectorate]] to form Nigeria took place in 1914.\n\n=====Ikoyi=====\n\n{{Main|Ikoyi}}\n[[Ikoyi]] is situated on the eastern half of Lagos Island and joined to it by a [[land fill]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edo-nation.net/eko.htm |title=Journal of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers: ''An empirical study of the Lagos state rent edict of 1997'' |author=Oni, A.

Ikoyi also has a number of hotels, night clubs, a recreational park and one of Africa's largest golf courses. Originally a [[middle class]] neighbourhood, in recent years, it has become a fashionable residential enclave for the [[upper middle class]] to the [[upper class]]. There are also commercial activities in Ikoyi, which is spotted in an increasing number of offices, banks, and shopping complexes. The commercial section is concentrated in the South-West.\n\n=====Victoria Island=====\n\n{{Main|Victoria Island (Nigeria)}}\n[[File:OandoHeadOffice.jpg|thumb|Oando Head Office in Victoria Island]]\nVictoria Island with its annexe is situated to the south of Lagos Island.<ref name=\"Conference\" /> It has expensive real estate properties and for that reason, many new luxury condos and apartments are blooming up everywhere.\nAlong with Ikoyi, Victoria Island occupies a major area in Lagos that boasts of several sizeable shopping districts. On its sea shore along the Atlantic front, there is environmentally reconstructed [[Bar Beach, Lagos|Bar Beach]].\n\nOne of the most important streets in Victoria Island Lagos is Saka Tinubu Street because it is where telecommunication business is done majorly, there is a plaza called GSM PLAZA where buying and selling of mobile phones and its accessories and other related businesses are carried out.\n\nIt was founded in 2001, a group of young men came together to form a small business outlets with each one having landline phone on the table and people made calls on pay as you use basis, but there was a new tune between 2002-2003 when gsm business commences in a bigger picture in Nigeria, today, it is a well known place.\n\n=====Iddo=====\n\nAcross the main channel of the lagoon from Lagos Island, there is a smaller settlement called [[Iddo Island|Iddo]]. Iddo is also [[Lagos Terminus railway station|a railroad terminus]] and it is now situated in the Lagos Mainland local government area after it was connected to the mainland like a peninsula.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laurapodolnick.com/lagosny.pdf |title=Giant Cities Of Tiny Islands |publisher= |accessdate=4 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66gvsx099?url=http://laurapodolnick.com/lagosny.pdf |archivedate=5 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Mainland====\nA huge population of Lagosians also live on the Lagos mainland, and most industries are located there. The mainland is known for its music and nightlife, which used to be located in areas around [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]] and [[Surulere]]. However, in recent years more night clubs have sprung up on the Island, making the Island (particularly Victoria Island, Ikate and Lekki Phase 1) the main nightlife attractions. Mainland LGAs include [[Surulere]], [[Apapa]], and [[Lagos Mainland]]. Metropolitan Lagos suburban LGAs include: [[Agege]], [[Amuwo Odofin]], [[Mushin, Lagos|Mushin]], [[Oshodi-Isolo]] and [[Ikeja]] (site of [[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]] and the capital of Lagos State).\n\nMajor Areas on the mainland include [[Ebute Metta]], [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]] and [[Ejigbo, Lagos|Ejigbo]]. Some rivers, like [[Badagry]] Creek, flow parallel to the coast for some distance before exiting through the sand bars to the sea.\n\n===Climate===\nLagos experiences a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], as there's a significant precipitation difference between the wet season and the dry season. The wet season starts in April and ends in October, while the dry season starts in November and ends in March. The wettest month is June with precipitation total {{convert|315.5|mm}}, while the driest month is January with precipitation total {{convert|13.2|mm}}.\n\nLocated near the equator, Lagos has only a slight seasonal temperature variation, with high temperatures ranging {{cvt|28.3|-|32.9|C|F}}. Lagos shares the seasons of the Southern Hemisphere, with summer highs in March, daily range {{cvt|32.9|-|24.1|C|F}}, and warm winters in August, ranging {{cvt|28.3|-|21.8|C|F}} as the daily average.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Lagos ([[Murtala Muhammed International Airport]]) MMIA   1961\u20131990, extremes: 1886\u2013present\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 40.0\n|Feb record high C = 37.1\n|Mar record high C = 37.0\n|Apr record high C = 39.6\n|May record high C = 37.0\n|Jun record high C = 37.6\n|Jul record high C = 33.2\n|Aug record high C = 33.0\n|Sep record high C = 33.2\n|Oct record high C = 33.7\n|Nov record high C = 39.9\n|Dec record high C = 36.4\n|year record high C = 40.0\n|Jan high C = 32.2\n|Feb high C = 33.2\n|Mar high C = 32.9\n|Apr high C = 32.2\n|May high C = 30.9\n|Jun high C = 29.3\n|Jul high C = 28.2\n|Aug high C = 28.3\n|Sep high C = 28.9\n|Oct high C = 30.3\n|Nov high C = 31.4\n|Dec high C = 31.8\n|year high C = 30.8\n|Jan mean C = 27.3\n|Feb mean C = 28.4\n|Mar mean C = 28.5\n|Apr mean C = 28.0\n|May mean C = 27.0\n|Jun mean C = 25.6\n|Jul mean C = 25.2\n|Aug mean C = 25.0\n|Sep mean C = 25.5\n|Oct mean C = 26.4\n|Nov mean C = 27.2\n|Dec mean C = 27.2\n|year mean C = 26.8\n|Jan low C = 22.4\n|Feb low C = 23.7\n|Mar low C = 24.1\n|Apr low C = 23.7\n|May low C = 23.2\n|Jun low C = 21.9\n|Jul low C = 22.3\n|Aug low C = 21.8\n|Sep low C = 22.1\n|Oct low C = 22.4\n|Nov low C = 23.0\n|Dec low C = 22.5\n|year low C = 22.8\n|Jan record low C = 12.6\n|Feb record low C = 16.1\n|Mar record low C = 14.0\n|Apr record low C = 14.9\n|May record low C = 20.0\n|Jun record low C = 21.2\n|Jul record low C = 15.0\n|Aug record low C = 19.0\n|Sep record low C = 13.0\n|Oct record low C = 17.9\n|Nov record low C = 11.1\n|Dec record low C = 11.6\n|year record low C = 11.1\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 13.2\n|Feb precipitation mm = 40.6\n|Mar precipitation mm = 84.3\n|Apr precipitation mm = 146.3\n|May precipitation mm = 202.4\n|Jun precipitation mm = 315.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 243.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 121.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 160.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 125.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 39.7\n|Dec precipitation mm = 14.8\n|year precipitation mm = 1506.6\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 1.5\n|Feb precipitation days = 2.8\n|Mar precipitation days = 6.6\n|Apr precipitation days = 9.0\n|May precipitation days = 12.5\n|Jun precipitation days = 16.2\n|Jul precipitation days = 13.2\n|Aug precipitation days = 11.6\n|Sep precipitation days = 12.7\n|Oct precipitation days = 11.2\n|Nov precipitation days = 4.9\n|Dec precipitation days = 2.1\n|year precipitation days = 104.3\n|Jan humidity = 81\n|Feb humidity = 79\n|Mar humidity = 76\n|Apr humidity = 82\n|May humidity = 84\n|Jun humidity = 87\n|Jul humidity = 87\n|Aug humidity = 85\n|Sep humidity = 86\n|Oct humidity = 87\n|Nov humidity = 84\n|Dec humidity = 82\n|year humidity = 83\n|Jan sun = 164.3\n|Feb sun = 168.0\n|Mar sun = 173.6\n|Apr sun = 180.0\n|May sun = 176.7\n|Jun sun = 114.0\n|Jul sun = 99.2\n|Aug sun = 108.5\n|Sep sun = 114.0\n|Oct sun = 167.4\n|Nov sun = 186.0\n|Dec sun = 192.2\n|year sun = 1843.9\n| source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (humidity, 1952\u20131967),<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_652010_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Lagos-Ikeja (Flugh.) / Nigeria\n| publisher = Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure\n| accessdate = 7 July 2016}}</ref> NOAA (sun)<ref name = NOAA>\n{{cite web\n| url = ftp://ftp.atdd.noaa.gov/pub/GCOS/WMO-Normals/TABLES/REG__I/NI/65201.TXT\n| title = Lagos Climate Normals 1961\u20131990\n| publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n| accessdate = 7 July 2016}}</ref> \n|source 2 = Meteo Climat (record highs and lows)<ref name = meteoclimat>\n{{cite web \n| url = http://meteo-climat-bzh.dyndns.org/index.php?page=stati&id=1769\n| title = Station Murtala\n| publisher = Meteo Climat \n| language = French \n| accessdate = 7 July 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{Main|Architecture of Lagos}}\n[[File:Lagos (Nigeria).jpg|thumb|left| Lagos skyline]]\n[[File:Lekki Conservation Center, Canopy walk.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lekki Conservation Centre]] canopy walk]]\n\nLagos has the tallest skyline in Nigeria.

The latter entity provides overall government for the metropolitan region. The Municipality of Lagos, which covered Lagos Island, Ikoyi, and Victoria Island as well as some mainland territory, was managed by the Lagos City Council (LCC), but it was disbanded in 1976 and divided into several [[Local Government Areas in Nigeria|Local Government Areas]] (most notably Lagos Island LGA, [[Lagos Mainland|Lagos Mainland LGA]] and [[Eti-Osa|Eti-Osa LGA]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Public Admin.

In the wake of the 1970s Nigerian oil boom, Lagos experienced a population explosion, untamed economic growth, and unmitigated rural migration. This caused the outlying towns and settlements to develop rapidly, thus forming the present day \"Lagos Metropolitan Area\", also known as \"Metropolitan Lagos\". The history of Lagos is still evidenced in the layout of the LGAs that display the unique identities of the cultures that created them.\n\nBy 2006, the metro area around Lagos had extended beyond Lagos State's boundaries and attained a [[megacity]] status. This much larger area is referred to as \"Greater Metropolitan Lagos\" or \"Lagos Megacity Region\", which is a continuous built up land area of additional {{convert|1,535.4|km2|sqmi|lk=out|abbr=off}}, comprising sprawls in LGAs situated next to Lagos' eastern and western city limits in Lagos State, and beyond northern limits, spilling into the LGAs in adjoining [[Ogun State]].

The video, which includes the logo for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, comprises a series of internet memes that featured Trump's head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d on parishioners who have the faces of his critics (among them [[Rosie O'Donnell]] and [[Kathy Griffin]]), the logos of media organizations (like [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], [[BBC News]], [[PBS]], [[CBS News]], and [[ABC News]]), activists groups (among them [[Black Lives Matter]]), and rivals (like [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Barack Obama]], and [[John McCain]]) superimposed on their bodies, which had been edited from a scene of a church massacre from the 2014 film ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]''. A person who attended the conference took a video of the clip on his phone and had an intermediary send it to a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which broke the story.

(Due to the eight-month window between production and broadcast, NBC would continue to air first-run episodes of ''Days'' through the summer of 2020 under its current backlog.)

The video, which includes the logo for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign, comprises a series of internet memes that featured Trump's head superimposed on the body of a man opening fire inside the \u201cChurch of Fake News\u201d on parishioners who have the faces of his critics (among them [[Rosie O'Donnell]] and [[Kathy Griffin]]), the logos of media organizations (like [[CNN]], [[MSNBC]], [[BBC News]], [[PBS]], [[CBS News]], and [[ABC News]]), activists groups (among them [[Black Lives Matter]]), and rivals (like [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Barack Obama]], and [[John McCain]]) superimposed on their bodies, which had been edited from a scene of a church massacre from the 2014 film ''[[Kingsman: The Secret Service]]''. A person who attended the conference took a video of the clip on his phone and had an intermediary send it to a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'', which broke the story.

The wheel functions much like a violin bow, and single notes played on the instrument sound similar to those of a violin. Melodies are played on a [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] that presses ''tangents''&mdash;small wedges, typically made of wood&mdash;against one or more of the strings to change their pitch. Like most other acoustic stringed instruments, it has a [[sound board (music)|sound board]] and hollow cavity to make the vibration of the strings audible.\n\nMost hurdy-gurdies have multiple [[drone (music)|drone]] strings, which give a constant pitch accompaniment to the melody, resulting in a sound similar to that of [[bagpipes]]. For this reason, the hurdy-gurdy is often used interchangeably or along with bagpipes, particularly in [[Occitan folk music|Occitan]], [[Music of Catalonia|Catalan]], [[Cajun music|Cajun French]] and contemporary [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias|Asturian]], [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias|Cantabric]], [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias|Galician]], [[Hungarian folk music|Hungarian]] and Slavic folk music.\n\nMany folk music festivals in Europe feature music groups with hurdy-gurdy players. The most famous has been held since 1976 at [[Saint-Chartier]] in the Indre ''d\u00e9partement'' in Central France. In 2009, it relocated nearby to the [[:fr:Ch\u00e2teau d'Ars (Indre)|Ch\u00e2teau d'Ars]] at [[La Ch\u00e2tre]], where it continues to take place during the week nearest July 14 ([[Bastille Day]]).<ref name=\"LaChatre2016\">[http://www.lesoncontinu.net La Ch\u00e2tre 2016] Retrieved 30 May 2016</ref>\n\n==Origins and history==\n\n[[File:Organistrumsantiago20060414.jpg|thumb|Ancient kings playing an [[organistrum]] at the P\u00f3rtico de la Gloria if the [[Catedral de Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Santiago de Compostela]], Spain]]\n\nThe hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from [[fiddles]] in either [[Europe]] or the [[Middle East]] (e.g., the [[rebab]] instrument) some time before the eleventh century A.D.<ref name=Baines/> The first recorded reference to fiddles in Europe was in the 9th century by the [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] (d. 911) describing the [[Byzantine lira|lira]] (''l\u016br\u0101'') as a typical instrument within the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>Margaret J. Kartomi: On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments. Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology, University of Chicago Press, 1990</ref> One of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the [[organistrum]], a large instrument with a [[guitar]]-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set (covering one diatonic octave). The organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings, which ran over a common bridge, and a relatively small wheel. Due to its size, the organistrum was played by two people, one of whom turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward. Pulling keys upward is cumbersome, so only slow tunes could be played on the organistrum.<ref>Christopher Page, \"The Medieval Organistrum and Symphonia. 1: A Legacy From the East?,\" ''The Galpin Society Journal'' 35:37\u201344, and \"The Medieval Organistrum and Symphonia. 2: Terminology,\" ''The Galpin Society Journal'' 36:71\u201387</ref>\n\nThe pitches on the organistrum were set according to [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean temperament]] and the instrument was primarily used in monastic and church settings to accompany choral music.

The ''solo organistrum'' was known from Spain and France, but was largely replaced by the ''[[symphonia]]'', a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard. At about the same time, a new form of key pressed from beneath was developed. These keys were much more practical for faster music and easier to handle; eventually they completely replaced keys pulled up from above. Medieval depictions of the ''symphonia'' show both types of keys.\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the hurdy-gurdy was a very popular instrument (along with the bagpipe) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end. It was around this time that ''buzzing bridges'' first appeared in illustrations. The buzzing bridge (commonly called the ''dog'') is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board. When the wheel is accelerated, one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates, creating a buzzing sound. The buzzing bridge is thought to have been borrowed from the ''[[tromba marina]]'' ([[monochord]]), a bowed string instrument.\n\nDuring the late Renaissance, two characteristic shapes of hurdy-gurdies developed. The first was guitar-shaped and the second had a rounded [[lute]]-type body made of staves. The lute-like body is especially characteristic of French instruments.\n\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 040.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], showing the first known depiction of a buzzing bridge on a hurdy-gurdy.]]\nBy the end of the 17th century changing musical tastes demanded greater polyphonic capabilities than the hurdy-gurdy could offer and pushed the instrument to the lowest social classes; as a result it acquired names like the German ''Bauernleier'' 'peasant's lyre' and ''Bettlerleier'' 'beggar's lyre'. During the 18th century, however, French [[Rococo]] tastes for rustic diversions brought the hurdy-gurdy back to the attention of the upper classes, where it acquired tremendous popularity among the nobility, with famous composers writing works for the hurdy-gurdy. The most famous of these is [[Nicolas Ch\u00e9deville]]'s ''Il pastor Fido'', attributed to [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]. At this time the most common style of hurdy-gurdy developed, the six-string ''vielle \u00e0 roue''. This instrument has two melody strings and four drones. The drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off, the instrument can be played in multiple keys (e.g., C and G, or G and D).\n\nDuring this time the hurdy-gurdy also spread further to Central Europe, where further variations developed in western Slavic countries, German-speaking areas and Hungary (see the list of types below for more information on them). Most types of hurdy-gurdy were essentially extinct by the early twentieth century, but a few have survived. The best-known are the French ''vielle \u00e0 roue'', the Hungarian ''teker\u0151lant'', and the Spanish ''zanfo\u00f1a''. In [[Ukraine]], a variety called the ''lira'' was widely used by blind street musicians, most of whom were [[Great Purge|purged]] by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in the 1930s (see [[Persecuted bandurists]]).{{Unreliable source?|reason=Cited page has multiple conflicting accounts.|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:FOURNEL(1887) p051 Fig.25-27.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Vagabonds with hurdy-gurdy (1887 drawing)]]The hurdy-gurdy tradition is well-developed particularly in [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. In Ukraine, it is known as the [[lira (Ukrainian instrument)|lira]] or relia. It was and still is played by professional, often blind, itinerant musicians known as [[lirnyk]]y. Their repertoire has mostly para-religious themes. Most of it originated in the Baroque period. In Eastern Ukraine, the repertoire includes unique historic epics known as ''[[Duma (epic)|dumy]]'' and folk dances.\n\nLirnyky were categorised as beggars by the Russian authorities and fell under harsh repressive measures if they were caught performing in the streets of major cities until 1902, when the authorities were asked by ethnographers attending the 12th All-Russian Archaeological conference to stop persecuting them.\n\nThe hurdy-gurdy is the instrument played by ''Der Leiermann'', the street musician portrayed in the last, melancholy song of [[Schubert]]'s ''[[Winterreise]]''. It is also featured and played prominently in the film ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'' (1937) as the instrument of the character Manuel, acted by [[Spencer Tracy]].\n\nThe instrument came into a new public consciousness when [[Donovan]] released his hit pop song, \"[[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]\", in 1968. Although the song does not use a hurdy-gurdy, the repeated reference to the instrument in the song's lyrics sparked curiosity and interest among young people, eventually resulting in an annual hurdy-gurdy music festival in the Olympic Peninsula area of the state of Washington each September.<ref name=\"AboutOTW\">[http://www.overthewater.org/about/ ''About the Over The Water Hurdy-Gurdy Association''.] From the 'Over The Water' website.

As the instrument has been revived, musicians have used it in a variety of styles of music (see the [[Recordings featuring the hurdy-gurdy|list of recordings that use hurdy-gurdy]]), including contemporary forms not typically associated with it.\n\n===Other instruments called hurdy-gurdies===\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the term ''hurdy-gurdy'' was also applied to a small, portable [[barrel organ]] or [[street organ]] (a cranked box instrument with a number of organ pipes, a bellows and a barrel with pins that rotated and programmed the tunes) that was frequently played by poor [[busking|buskers]], street musicians specifically called [[Street organ#Organ grinders|organ grinders]]. Such organs require only the turning of the crank to play; the music is coded by pinned barrels, perforated paper rolls, and, more recently, by electronic modules.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The French call these organs ''Orgue de Barbarie'' (\"Barbary organ\"), while the Germans and Dutch say ''Drehorgel'' and ''draaiorgel'' (\"turned organ\"), instead of ''Drehleier'' (\"turning lyre\"). In Czech, the organ is called ''Fla\u0161inet''.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Cellar Darling Rockharz 2018 18.jpg|thumb|[[Anna Murphy (musician)|Anna Murphy]] ([[Cellar Darling]]; former [[Eluveitie]]) plays a modern version of the hurdy-gurdy]]\nA person who plays the hurdy-gurdy is called a '''hurdy-gurdist''', or (particularly for players of French instruments) '''viellist'''.\n\nIn France, a player is called '''''un sonneur de vielle''''' (literally: \"''a sounder of vielle''\"), '''''un vielleux''''' or '''''un vielleur'''''.\n\nBecause of the prominence of the French tradition, many instrument and performance terms used in English are commonly taken from the French, and players generally need to know these terms to read relevant literature.

This term was considered derogatory in the Hungarian lowlands, but was the normal term for the instrument on [[Csepel island]] directly south of Budapest.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The equivalent names ''ninera'' and ''nin\u011bra'' are used in Slovakia and the Czech Republic respectively. In Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian, the instrument is called \"wheel lyre\" (''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0451\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0440\u0430'', ''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0456\u0440\u0430'', ''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0456\u0440\u0430''). In Poland it is called \"cranked lyre\" (lira korbowa).\n\n''Leier'', ''lant'', and related terms today are generally used to refer to members of the [[lute]] or [[lyre]] family, but historically had a broader range of meaning and were used for many types of stringed instruments.\n\n==Design==\n\n===Shape===\n[[File:Hurdyparts.png|thumb|right|Major parts of a modern French-type hurdy-gurdy]]\nIn her overview of the instrument's history, Palmer recorded twenty-three different forms,<ref name=\"Palmer\"/>{{rp|23\u201334}} and there is still no standardized design today.\n\nThe six-stringed French ''vielle \u00e0 roue'' is the best-known and most common sort. A number of regional forms developed, but outside France the instrument was considered a [[folk instrument]] and there were no schools of construction that could have determined a standard form.\n\nThere are two primary body styles for contemporary instruments: guitar-bodied and lute-backed. Both forms are found in French-speaking areas, while guitar-bodied instruments are the general form elsewhere. The box form of the ''simphonia'' is also commonly found among players of early music and historical re-enactors.\n\n===Strings===\n[[File:WheelTangents.jpg|thumb|left|Wheel and tangents on a French type hurdy-gurdy with three ''chanterelles'' (melody strings). The keyboard is visible on the right side of the picture.]]\n\nHistorically, strings were made of [[Catgut|gut]], which is still a preferred material today and modern instruments are mounted with violin (D or A) and cello (A, G, C) strings.<ref name=\"Muskett\"/>{{rp|10\u201312}} However, metal strings have become common in the twentieth century, especially for the heavier drone strings or for lower melody strings if octave tuning is used. Nylon is also sometimes used, but is disliked by many players. Some instruments also have optional sympathetic strings, generally guitar or banjo B strings.<ref name=\"Muskett\"/>{{rp|10\u201312}}\n\nThe drone strings produce steady sounds at fixed pitches. The melody string(s) (French ''chanterelle(s)'', Hungarian ''dallamh\u00far(ok)'') are stopped with tangents attached to keys that change the vibration length of the string, much as a guitarist uses his or her fingers on the fretboard of a guitar. In the earliest hurdy-gurdies these keys were arranged to provide a [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean temperament]], but in later instruments the tunings have varied widely, with [[equal temperament]] most common because it allows easier blending with other instruments. However, because the tangents can be adjusted to tune individual notes, it is possible to tune hurdy-gurdies to almost any temperament as needed. Most contemporary hurdy-gurdies have 24 keys that cover a range of two chromatic octaves.\n\nTo achieve proper intonation and sound quality, each string of a hurdy-gurdy must be wrapped with cotton or similar fibers. The cotton on melody strings tends to be quite light, while drone strings have heavier cotton. Improper cottoning results in a raspy tone, especially at higher pitches. In addition, individual strings (in particular the melody strings) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small pieces of paper placed between the strings and the bridge, a process called ''shimming''. Shimming and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument's strings.\n\n===Buzzing bridge===\n\n[[File:FrenchBuzzingBridgeSystem.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Entire buzzing bridge system for a French-style instrument, with part labels]]\n\nIn some types of hurdy-gurdy, notably the French ''vielle \u00e0 roue'' ('fiddle with a wheel') and the Hungarian ''teker\u0151lant'' (''teker\u0151'' for short), makers have added a buzzing bridge\u2014called a ''chien'' (French for dog) or ''recseg\u0151'' (Hungarian for \"buzzer\")\u2014on one drone string. Modern makers have increased the number of buzzing bridges on French-style instruments to as many as four. This mechanism consists of a loose bridge under a drone string. The tail of the buzzing bridge is inserted into a narrow vertical slot (or held by a peg in Hungarian instruments) that holds the buzzing bridge in place (and also serves as a bridge for additional drone strings on some instruments).\n\nThe free end of the dog (called the ''hammer'') rests on the soundboard of the hurdy-gurdy and is more or less free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string (called the ''trompette'' on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, sounding a drone. When the crank is struck, the hammer lifts up suddenly and vibrates against the soundboard, producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.\n\nOn French-style instruments, the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge can be altered by turning a peg called a ''tirant'' in the tailpiece of the instrument that is connected by a wire or thread to the ''trompette''. The ''tirant'' adjusts the lateral pressure on the ''trompette'' and thereby sets the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge to changes in wheel velocity. When hard to trigger, the strike or the bridge is said \"sec\" (dry), \"chien sec\" or \"coup sec\". When easy to trigger, the strike or the bridge is said \"gras\" (fat), \"chien gras\", or \"coup gras\".\n\nThere are various stylistic techniques that are used as the player turns the crank, striking the wheel at various points in its revolution. This technique is often known by its French term, the ''coup-de-poignet'' (or, more simply, the shortened ''coup''). The percussion is transmitted to the wheel by striking the handle with the thumb, fingers or base of the thumb at one or more of four points in the revolution of the wheel (often described in terms of the clock face, 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock) to achieve the desired rhythm. A long buzz can also be achieved by accelerating the wheel with the handle. It is called either \"un gliss\u00e9\" (a slide) or \"une train\u00e9e\" (a streak).\n\nOn the Hungarian ''teker\u0151'' the same control is achieved by using a wedge called the ''recseg\u0151\u00e9k'' (control wedge, or literally \"buzzer wedge\") that pushes the drone string downward. In traditional ''teker\u0151'' playing, the buzzing bridge is controlled entirely by the wrist of the player and has a very different sound and rhythmic possibilities from those available on French instruments.\n\n====French and Hungarian buzzing bridges====\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:FrenchBuzzingBridge.jpg|French type buzzing bridge\nFile:TekeroBassBuzzing.jpg|Hungarian type buzzing bridge (on a bass ''teker\u0151'')\n</gallery>\n\n===Regional types===\n\nRegional types of hurdy-gurdies since the Renaissance can also be classified based on wheel size and the presence or absence (and type) of a buzzing bridge.

They feature a broad keybox and the drone strings run within the keybox. Because of the small size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings: one melody string, one tenor drone and one bass drone. They sometimes have up to five strings.\n* '''''String-adjusted buzzing bridge'''''\n** ''German pear-shaped Drehleier.'' Two to three drone strings and one or two chromatic melody strings.

Three drones + one diatonic melody string\n\n====Large wheel====\n\nLarge-wheeled instruments (wheel diameters between 14 and 17&nbsp;cm, or about 5.5{{snd}}6.6&nbsp;inches) are traditionally found in Western Europe. These instruments generally have a narrow keybox with drone strings that run outside the keybox. They also generally have more strings and doubling or tripling of the melody string is common. Some modern instruments have as many as fifteen strings played by the wheel, although the most common number is six.\n* '''''String-adjusted buzzing bridge'''''\n** ''vielle \u00e0 roue'' (French). Usually four drones + two melody strings, but often extended to have more strings. Two body forms: guitar-bodied and lute-backed (''vielle en luth''). French instruments generally have a narrow key box with drone strings that run on the outside of the key box. Traditional French instruments have two melody strings and four drone strings with one buzzing bridge. Contemporary instruments often have more: the instrument of well-known player [[:fr:Gilles Chabenat|Gilles Chabenat]] has four melody strings fixed to a viola tailpiece, and four drone strings on a cello tailpiece. This instrument also has three trompette strings.\n** ''Nin\u011bra'' (Czech). Guitar-shaped. Two forms: one has a standard drone-melody arrangement, while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox. Both diatonic and chromatic forms are found. Other mechanisms for adjusting the amount of \"buzz\" on the trompette string.\n* '''''No buzzing bridge'''''\n** ''Zanfona'' (Spain). Typically guitar-shaped body, with three melody strings, and two drone strings. Some older examples had a diatonic keyboard, and most modern models have a chromatic keyboard. Zanfonas are usually tuned to the key of C major, with the melody strings tuned in unison to G above the middle C on the piano. The drones are: the ''bordonci\u00f1o'' in G (one octave below the melody strings) and the ''bord\u00f3n'' in C (two octaves below middle C). Sometimes, two of the melody strings are in unison, and the remaining string is tuned an octave lower, in unison with the ''bordonci\u00f1o'' (this string was sometimes known as the ''human voice'', because it sounds as if someone is humming the melody an octave lower).\n** ''nin\u011bra'' (Czech).

The wheel functions much like a violin bow, and single notes played on the instrument sound similar to those of a violin. Melodies are played on a [[Musical keyboard|keyboard]] that presses ''tangents''&mdash;small wedges, typically made of wood&mdash;against one or more of the strings to change their pitch. Like most other acoustic stringed instruments, it has a [[sound board (music)|sound board]] and hollow cavity to make the vibration of the strings audible.\n\nMost hurdy-gurdies have multiple [[drone (music)|drone]] strings, which give a constant pitch accompaniment to the melody, resulting in a sound similar to that of [[bagpipes]]. For this reason, the hurdy-gurdy is often used interchangeably or along with bagpipes, particularly in [[Occitan folk music|Occitan]], [[Music of Catalonia|Catalan]], [[Cajun music|Cajun French]] and contemporary [[Music of Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias|Asturian, Cantabric, Galician]], [[Hungarian folk music|Hungarian]] and Slavic folk music.\n\nMany folk music festivals in Europe feature music groups with hurdy-gurdy players. The most famous has been held since 1976 at [[Saint-Chartier]] in the Indre ''d\u00e9partement'' in Central France. In 2009, it relocated nearby to the [[:fr:Ch\u00e2teau d'Ars (Indre)|Ch\u00e2teau d'Ars]] at [[La Ch\u00e2tre]], where it continues to take place during the week nearest July 14 ([[Bastille Day]]).<ref name=\"LaChatre2016\">[http://www.lesoncontinu.net La Ch\u00e2tre 2016] Retrieved 30 May 2016</ref>\n\n==Origins and history==\n\n[[File:Organistrumsantiago20060414.jpg|thumb|Ancient kings playing an [[organistrum]] at the P\u00f3rtico de la Gloria if the [[Catedral de Santiago de Compostela]] in [[Santiago de Compostela]], Spain]]\n\nThe hurdy-gurdy is generally thought to have originated from [[fiddles]] in either [[Europe]] or the [[Middle East]] (e.g., the [[rebab]] instrument) some time before the eleventh century A.D.<ref name=Baines/> The first recorded reference to fiddles in Europe was in the 9th century by the [[Persian people|Persian]] geographer [[Ibn Khordadbeh|Ibn Khurradadhbih]] (d. 911) describing the [[Byzantine lira|lira]] (''l\u016br\u0101'') as a typical instrument within the [[Byzantine Empire]].<ref>Margaret J. Kartomi: On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments. Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology, University of Chicago Press, 1990</ref> One of the earliest forms of the hurdy-gurdy was the [[organistrum]], a large instrument with a [[guitar]]-shaped body and a long neck in which the keys were set (covering one diatonic octave). The organistrum had a single melody string and two drone strings, which ran over a common bridge, and a relatively small wheel. Due to its size, the organistrum was played by two people, one of whom turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward. Pulling keys upward is cumbersome, so only slow tunes could be played on the organistrum.<ref>Christopher Page, \"The Medieval Organistrum and Symphonia. 1: A Legacy From the East?,\" ''The Galpin Society Journal'' 35:37\u201344, and \"The Medieval Organistrum and Symphonia. 2: Terminology,\" ''The Galpin Society Journal'' 36:71\u201387</ref>\n\nThe pitches on the organistrum were set according to [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean temperament]] and the instrument was primarily used in monastic and church settings to accompany choral music. Abbot [[Odo of Cluny]] (died 942) is supposed to have written a short description of the construction of the organistrum entitled ''Quomodo organistrum construatur'' (How the Organistrum Is Made),<ref>''Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra potissimum'', 3 vols., ed.

The ''solo organistrum'' was known from Spain and France, but was largely replaced by the ''[[symphonia]]'', a small box-shaped version of the hurdy-gurdy with three strings and a diatonic keyboard. At about the same time, a new form of key pressed from beneath was developed. These keys were much more practical for faster music and easier to handle; eventually they completely replaced keys pulled up from above. Medieval depictions of the ''symphonia'' show both types of keys.\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], the hurdy-gurdy was a very popular instrument (along with the bagpipe) and the characteristic form had a short neck and a boxy body with a curved tail end. It was around this time that ''buzzing bridges'' first appeared in illustrations. The buzzing bridge (commonly called the ''dog'') is an asymmetrical bridge that rests under a drone string on the sound board. When the wheel is accelerated, one foot of the bridge lifts from the soundboard and vibrates, creating a buzzing sound. The buzzing bridge is thought to have been borrowed from the ''[[tromba marina]]'' ([[monochord]]), a bowed string instrument.\n\nDuring the late Renaissance, two characteristic shapes of hurdy-gurdies developed. The first was guitar-shaped and the second had a rounded [[lute]]-type body made of staves. The lute-like body is especially characteristic of French instruments.\n\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch 040.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' by [[Hieronymus Bosch]], showing the first known depiction of a buzzing bridge on a hurdy-gurdy.]]\nBy the end of the 17th century changing musical tastes demanded greater polyphonic capabilities than the hurdy-gurdy could offer and pushed the instrument to the lowest social classes; as a result it acquired names like the German ''Bauernleier'' 'peasant's lyre' and ''Bettlerleier'' 'beggar's lyre'. During the 18th century, however, French [[Rococo]] tastes for rustic diversions brought the hurdy-gurdy back to the attention of the upper classes, where it acquired tremendous popularity among the nobility, with famous composers writing works for the hurdy-gurdy. The most famous of these is [[Nicolas Ch\u00e9deville]]'s ''Il pastor Fido'', attributed to [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]. At this time the most common style of hurdy-gurdy developed, the six-string ''vielle \u00e0 roue''. This instrument has two melody strings and four drones. The drone strings are tuned so that by turning them on or off, the instrument can be played in multiple keys (e.g., C and G, or G and D).\n\nDuring this time the hurdy-gurdy also spread further to Central Europe, where further variations developed in western Slavic countries, German-speaking areas and Hungary (see the list of types below for more information on them). Most types of hurdy-gurdy were essentially extinct by the early twentieth century, but a few have survived. The best-known are the French ''vielle \u00e0 roue'', the Hungarian ''teker\u0151lant'', and the Spanish ''zanfo\u00f1a''. In [[Ukraine]], a variety called the ''lira'' was widely used by blind street musicians, most of whom were [[Great Purge|purged]] by [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in the 1930s (see [[Persecuted bandurists]]).{{Unreliable source?|reason=Cited page has multiple conflicting accounts.|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[File:FOURNEL(1887) p051 Fig.25-27.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Vagabonds with hurdy-gurdy (1887 drawing)]]The hurdy-gurdy tradition is well-developed particularly in [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. In Ukraine, it is known as the [[lira (Ukrainian instrument)|lira]] or relia. It was and still is played by professional, often blind, itinerant musicians known as [[lirnyk]]y. Their repertoire has mostly para-religious themes. Most of it originated in the Baroque period. In Eastern Ukraine, the repertoire includes unique historic epics known as ''[[Duma (epic)|dumy]]'' and folk dances.\n\nLirnyky were categorised as beggars by the Russian authorities and fell under harsh repressive measures if they were caught performing in the streets of major cities until 1902, when the authorities were asked by ethnographers attending the 12th All-Russian Archaeological conference to stop persecuting them.\n\nThe hurdy-gurdy is the instrument played by ''Der Leiermann'', the street musician portrayed in the last, melancholy song of [[Schubert]]'s ''[[Winterreise]]''. It is also featured and played prominently in the film ''[[Captains Courageous (1937 film)|Captains Courageous]]'' (1937) as the instrument of the character Manuel, acted by [[Spencer Tracy]].\n\nThe instrument came into a new public consciousness when [[Donovan]] released his hit pop song, \"[[Hurdy Gurdy Man]]\", in 1968. Although the song does not use a hurdy-gurdy, the repeated reference to the instrument in the song's lyrics sparked curiosity and interest among young people, eventually resulting in an annual hurdy-gurdy music festival in the Olympic Peninsula area of the state of Washington each September.<ref name=\"AboutOTW\">[http://www.overthewater.org/about/ ''About the Over The Water Hurdy-Gurdy Association''.] From the 'Over The Water' website.

As the instrument has been revived, musicians have used it in a variety of styles of music (see the [[Recordings featuring the hurdy-gurdy|list of recordings that use hurdy-gurdy]]), including contemporary forms not typically associated with it.\n\n===Other instruments called hurdy-gurdies===\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the term ''hurdy-gurdy'' was also applied to a small, portable [[barrel organ]] or [[street organ]] (a cranked box instrument with a number of organ pipes, a bellows and a barrel with pins that rotated and programmed the tunes) that was frequently played by poor [[busking|buskers]], street musicians specifically called [[Street organ#Organ grinders|organ grinders]]. Such organs require only the turning of the crank to play; the music is coded by pinned barrels, perforated paper rolls, and, more recently, by electronic modules.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The French call these organs ''Orgue de Barbarie'' (\"Barbary organ\"), while the Germans and Dutch say ''Drehorgel'' and ''draaiorgel'' (\"turned organ\"), instead of ''Drehleier'' (\"turning lyre\"). In Czech, the organ is called ''Fla\u0161inet''.\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Cellar Darling Rockharz 2018 18.jpg|thumb|[[Anna Murphy (musician)|Anna Murphy]] ([[Cellar Darling]]; former [[Eluveitie]]) plays a modern version of the hurdy-gurdy]]\nA person who plays the hurdy-gurdy is called a '''hurdy-gurdist''', or (particularly for players of French instruments) '''viellist'''.\n\nIn France, a player is called '''''un sonneur de vielle''''' (literally: \"''a sounder of vielle''\"), '''''un vielleux''''' or '''''un vielleur'''''.\n\nBecause of the prominence of the French tradition, many instrument and performance terms used in English are commonly taken from the French, and players generally need to know these terms to read relevant literature. Such common terms include the following:\n\n* ''trompette'': the highest-pitched drone string that features the buzzing bridge\n* ''mouche'': the drone string pitched a fourth or fifth below the trompette\n* ''petit bourdon'': the drone string pitched an octave below the trompette\n* ''gros bourdon'': the drone string pitched an octave below the mouche\n* ''chanterelle(s)'': melody string(s), also called ''chanters'' or ''chanter strings'' in English\n* ''chien'': (literally \"dog\"), the buzzing bridge\n* ''tirant'': a small peg set in the instrument's tailpiece that is used to control the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge\n\n===Names of the instrument===\n[[File:SzerenyiTekero.jpg|thumb|right|Two Hungarian-style hurdy-gurdies (''teker\u0151lants'')]]\n[[File:MuseuMusicaBCN 8963.jpg|thumb|Hurdy-gurdy in [[Museu de la M\u00fasica de Barcelona]]]]\n\nAccording to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], the mid 18th century origin of the term ''hurdy-gurdy'' is [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] in origin, after the repetitive warble in pitch that characterizes instruments with solid wooden wheels that have warped due to changes in humidity or after the sound of the buzzing-bridge.<ref name=\"OED\">{{cite web \n| title = Oxford English Dictionaries online entry for ''hurdy-gurdy''\n| url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/hurdy-gurdy\n| website = oxforddictionaries.com\n| access-date = 26 January 2016}}</ref> Alternately, the term is thought to come from the Scottish and northern English term for uproar or disorder, ''hirdy-girdy''<ref name=\"Palmer\"/>{{rp|41}} or from ''hurly-burly'',<ref name=\"Palmer\"/>{{rp|40}} an old English term for noise or commotion.<!-- An alternative [[folk etymology]] suggests the term comes from an anglicized form of the French ''harpe de gourde''.{{fact|date=March 2007}} --> The instrument is sometimes more descriptively called a ''wheel fiddle'' in English, but this term is rarely used among players of the instrument.

This term was considered derogatory in the Hungarian lowlands, but was the normal term for the instrument on [[Csepel island]] directly south of Budapest.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The equivalent names ''ninera'' and ''nin\u011bra'' are used in Slovakia and the Czech Republic respectively. In Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian, the instrument is called \"wheel lyre\" (''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0451\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0438\u0440\u0430'', ''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u0456\u0440\u0430'', ''\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430\u044f \u043b\u0456\u0440\u0430''). In Poland it is called \"cranked lyre\" (lira korbowa).\n\n''Leier'', ''lant'', and related terms today are generally used to refer to members of the [[lute]] or [[lyre]] family, but historically had a broader range of meaning and were used for many types of stringed instruments.\n\n==Design==\n\n===Shape===\n[[File:Hurdyparts.png|thumb|right|Major parts of a modern French-type hurdy-gurdy]]\nIn her overview of the instrument's history, Palmer recorded twenty-three different forms,<ref name=\"Palmer\"/>{{rp|23\u201334}} and there is still no standardized design today.\n\nThe six-stringed French ''vielle \u00e0 roue'' is the best-known and most common sort. A number of regional forms developed, but outside France the instrument was considered a [[folk instrument]] and there were no schools of construction that could have determined a standard form.\n\nThere are two primary body styles for contemporary instruments: guitar-bodied and lute-backed. Both forms are found in French-speaking areas, while guitar-bodied instruments are the general form elsewhere. The box form of the ''simphonia'' is also commonly found among players of early music and historical re-enactors.\n\n===Strings===\n[[File:WheelTangents.jpg|thumb|left|Wheel and tangents on a French type hurdy-gurdy with three ''chanterelles'' (melody strings). The keyboard is visible on the right side of the picture.]]\n\nHistorically, strings were made of [[Catgut|gut]], which is still a preferred material today and modern instruments are mounted with violin (D or A) and cello (A, G, C) strings.<ref name=\"Muskett\"/>{{rp|10\u201312}} However, metal strings have become common in the twentieth century, especially for the heavier drone strings or for lower melody strings if octave tuning is used. Nylon is also sometimes used, but is disliked by many players. Some instruments also have optional sympathetic strings, generally guitar or banjo B strings.<ref name=\"Muskett\"/>{{rp|10\u201312}}\n\nThe drone strings produce steady sounds at fixed pitches. The melody string(s) (French ''chanterelle(s)'', Hungarian ''dallamh\u00far(ok)'') are stopped with tangents attached to keys that change the vibration length of the string, much as a guitarist uses his or her fingers on the fretboard of a guitar. In the earliest hurdy-gurdies these keys were arranged to provide a [[Pythagorean tuning|Pythagorean temperament]], but in later instruments the tunings have varied widely, with [[equal temperament]] most common because it allows easier blending with other instruments. However, because the tangents can be adjusted to tune individual notes, it is possible to tune hurdy-gurdies to almost any temperament as needed. Most contemporary hurdy-gurdies have 24 keys that cover a range of two chromatic octaves.\n\nTo achieve proper intonation and sound quality, each string of a hurdy-gurdy must be wrapped with cotton or similar fibers. The cotton on melody strings tends to be quite light, while drone strings have heavier cotton. Improper cottoning results in a raspy tone, especially at higher pitches. In addition, individual strings (in particular the melody strings) often have to have their height above the wheel surface adjusted by having small pieces of paper placed between the strings and the bridge, a process called ''shimming''. Shimming and cottoning are connected processes since either one can affect the geometry of the instrument's strings.\n\n===Buzzing bridge===\n\n[[File:FrenchBuzzingBridgeSystem.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Entire buzzing bridge system for a French-style instrument, with part labels]]\n\nIn some types of hurdy-gurdy, notably the French ''vielle \u00e0 roue'' ('fiddle with a wheel') and the Hungarian ''teker\u0151lant'' (''teker\u0151'' for short), makers have added a buzzing bridge\u2014called a ''chien'' (French for dog) or ''recseg\u0151'' (Hungarian for \"buzzer\")\u2014on one drone string. Modern makers have increased the number of buzzing bridges on French-style instruments to as many as four. This mechanism consists of a loose bridge under a drone string. The tail of the buzzing bridge is inserted into a narrow vertical slot (or held by a peg in Hungarian instruments) that holds the buzzing bridge in place (and also serves as a bridge for additional drone strings on some instruments).\n\nThe free end of the dog (called the ''hammer'') rests on the soundboard of the hurdy-gurdy and is more or less free to vibrate. When the wheel is turned regularly and not too fast the pressure on the string (called the ''trompette'' on French instruments) holds the bridge in place, sounding a drone. When the crank is struck, the hammer lifts up suddenly and vibrates against the soundboard, producing a characteristic rhythmic buzz that is used as an articulation or to provide percussive effect, especially in dance pieces.\n\nOn French-style instruments, the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge can be altered by turning a peg called a ''tirant'' in the tailpiece of the instrument that is connected by a wire or thread to the ''trompette''. The ''tirant'' adjusts the lateral pressure on the ''trompette'' and thereby sets the sensitivity of the buzzing bridge to changes in wheel velocity. When hard to trigger, the strike or the bridge is said \"sec\" (dry), \"chien sec\" or \"coup sec\". When easy to trigger, the strike or the bridge is said \"gras\" (fat), \"chien gras\", or \"coup gras\".\n\nThere are various stylistic techniques that are used as the player turns the crank, striking the wheel at various points in its revolution. This technique is often known by its French term, the ''coup-de-poignet'' (or, more simply, the shortened ''coup''). The percussion is transmitted to the wheel by striking the handle with the thumb, fingers or base of the thumb at one or more of four points in the revolution of the wheel (often described in terms of the clock face, 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock) to achieve the desired rhythm. A long buzz can also be achieved by accelerating the wheel with the handle. It is called either \"un gliss\u00e9\" (a slide) or \"une train\u00e9e\" (a streak).\n\nOn the Hungarian ''teker\u0151'' the same control is achieved by using a wedge called the ''recseg\u0151\u00e9k'' (control wedge, or literally \"buzzer wedge\") that pushes the drone string downward. In traditional ''teker\u0151'' playing, the buzzing bridge is controlled entirely by the wrist of the player and has a very different sound and rhythmic possibilities from those available on French instruments.\n\n====French and Hungarian buzzing bridges====\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:FrenchBuzzingBridge.jpg|French type buzzing bridge\nFile:TekeroBassBuzzing.jpg|Hungarian type buzzing bridge (on a bass ''teker\u0151'')\n</gallery>\n\n===Regional types===\n\nRegional types of hurdy-gurdies since the Renaissance can also be classified based on wheel size and the presence or absence (and type) of a buzzing bridge.

They feature a broad keybox and the drone strings run within the keybox. Because of the small size of the wheel these instruments most commonly have three strings: one melody string, one tenor drone and one bass drone. They sometimes have up to five strings.\n* '''''String-adjusted buzzing bridge'''''\n** ''German pear-shaped Drehleier.'' Two to three drone strings and one or two chromatic melody strings. Characteristic V-shaped pegbox. Often extensively decorated. The type of buzzing bridge found on this instrument usually has the adjustment peg set in a block next to the string, rather than in the tailpiece (as is typical of French instruments).\n** ''lira/vevlira'' (Sweden). Revived in the twentieth century based on historical examples. Two body forms: an elongated boxy shape and a long pear shape. Usually diatonic, but has been extended with a chromatic range with the additional keys placed ''below'' the normal diatonic range (the opposite of most chromatic hurdy-gurdy keyboards)\n* '''''Wedge-adjusted buzzing bridge'''''\n** ''teker\u0151lant (Hungarian)''. Usually two drones (sometimes three) + one or two chromatic melody strings. The broad keybox is often carved or decorated extensively.\n** ''Tyrolian Drehleier (Austria).'' Very similar to the teker\u0151lant, but usually has a diatonic keyboard. May be the historical source for the teker\u0151.<ref name=\"NagyArticle\"/>\n* '''''No buzzing bridge'''''[[File:SK Ninera.JPG|thumb|right|Slovak-style hurdy-gurdy ([[ninera]]) made and played by Tibor Koblicek]]\n** ''lira korbowa'' (Poland). Guitar-shaped. Two drones + one diatonic melody string.\n** ''lira/\u043b\u0438\u0440\u0430'' (Russia). Guitar-shaped. Two drones + one diatonic melody string. Evenly spaced keyboard.\n** ''relia/\u0440\u0435\u043b\u044f'' (Ukraine). Guitar-shaped. Two drones + one diatonic melody string. Two body types: carved from a single piece of wood and guitar-shaped with transverse pegs and mult-piece construction with vertical pegs. Evenly spaced keyboard.\n** ''[[ninera]]/kolovratec'' (Slovakia). Guitar-shaped. Two drones + one diatonic melody string. Broad keybox. Superficially similar to the teker\u0151, but lacks the buzzing bridge.\n** ''German tulip-shaped Drehleier.'' Three drones + one diatonic melody string\n\n====Large wheel====\n\nLarge-wheeled instruments (wheel diameters between 14 and 17&nbsp;cm, or about 5.5{{snd}}6.6&nbsp;inches) are traditionally found in Western Europe. These instruments generally have a narrow keybox with drone strings that run outside the keybox. They also generally have more strings and doubling or tripling of the melody string is common. Some modern instruments have as many as fifteen strings played by the wheel, although the most common number is six.\n* '''''String-adjusted buzzing bridge'''''\n** ''vielle \u00e0 roue'' (French). Usually four drones + two melody strings, but often extended to have more strings. Two body forms: guitar-bodied and lute-backed (''vielle en luth''). French instruments generally have a narrow key box with drone strings that run on the outside of the key box. Traditional French instruments have two melody strings and four drone strings with one buzzing bridge. Contemporary instruments often have more: the instrument of well-known player [[:fr:Gilles Chabenat|Gilles Chabenat]] has four melody strings fixed to a viola tailpiece, and four drone strings on a cello tailpiece. This instrument also has three trompette strings.\n** ''Nin\u011bra'' (Czech). Guitar-shaped. Two forms: one has a standard drone-melody arrangement, while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox. Both diatonic and chromatic forms are found. Other mechanisms for adjusting the amount of \"buzz\" on the trompette string.\n* '''''No buzzing bridge'''''\n** ''Zanfona'' (Spain). Typically guitar-shaped body, with three melody strings, and two drone strings. Some older examples had a diatonic keyboard, and most modern models have a chromatic keyboard. Zanfonas are usually tuned to the key of C major, with the melody strings tuned in unison to G above the middle C on the piano. The drones are: the ''bordonci\u00f1o'' in G (one octave below the melody strings) and the ''bord\u00f3n'' in C (two octaves below middle C). Sometimes, two of the melody strings are in unison, and the remaining string is tuned an octave lower, in unison with the ''bordonci\u00f1o'' (this string was sometimes known as the ''human voice'', because it sounds as if someone is humming the melody an octave lower).\n** ''nin\u011bra'' (Czech). Guitar-shaped. Two forms: one has a standard drone-melody arrangement, while the other runs the drone strings between the melody strings in the keybox. Both diatonic and chromatic forms are found.\n\n== Electric and electronic hurdy-gurdies ==\n[[File:MidiGurdy.jpg|thumb|Electronic hurdy gurdy MidiGurdy]]\nIn [[pop music]], especially in the popular [[neo-medieval music]], electric hurdy-gurdies are used, wherein [[Electromagnetic induction|electro magnetic]]  [[Pickup (music technology)|pickups]] convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals.

The signals for the melody strings are purely generated electronically by the keys and also in combination with the rotation of the wheel. The signals for drone strings and the  snares are generated by the crank movements of the wheel. Depending on the technical equipment of the instrument, the [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital audio signal]] can be output directly via an integrated [[Processor (computing)|processor]] and [[sound card]]. The data exchange of the musical information between the hurdy-gurdy and connected computers, [[sampling (music)|samplers]] or synthesizers are managed via [[musical instrument digital interface|MIDI interface]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Banshee in Avalon |url=https://en.audiofanzine.com/misc-midi-controller/marcus-weseloh/midigurdy/news/a.play,n.19378.html |title=A Hurdy Gurdy and MIDI controller |website=audiofanzine |date=2014-11-27 |access-date=2018-12-08 }}</ref>\n\n== Musicians ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n* [[Ritchie Blackmore]]\n* [[:fr:Patrick Bouffard|Patrick Bouffard]] {{in lang|fr}}\n* [[Mykola Budnyk]]\n* [[Dorothy Carter]]\n* [[R\u00e9gine Chassagne]]\n* [[Valentin Clastrier]]\n* [[Gaia Consort]]\n* [[R\u00e9my Couvez]]\n* [[Cellar Darling]]\n* [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Dutertre]]\n* [[Nigel Eaton]]\n* [[Eluveitie]]\n* [[Faun (band)|Faun]]\n* [[Jem Finer]]\n* [[Ben Grossman]]\n* [[Keiji Haino]]\n* [[Andy Irvine (musician)|Andy Irvine]]\n* [[Ithilien (band)|Ithilien]]\n* [[Jonne J\u00e4rvel\u00e4]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/korpiklaani/about|title=Korpiklaani|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref>\n* [[The Kelly Family|Paul, Kathy, and Barby Kelly]]\n* [[Anna Katharina Kr\u00e4nzlein]]\n* [[:de:Matthias Loibner|Matthias Loibner]]\n* [[Metallica]]\n* [[Saltatio Mortis]]\n* [[Anna Murphy (musician)|Anna Murphy]]\n* [[Anton Newcombe]]\n* [[Candice Night]]\n* [[Emmanuelle Parrenin]]\n* [[Dominique Regef]]\n* [[Stam1na]]<ref name=\"Kajo\">{{cite web \n| title = Kajo \n| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07dqBWPl6O4\n| website = youtube.com\n| access-date = 31 July 2019}}</ref>\n*[[Stevie Wishart]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Donskoy ryley]], Russian instrument similar to the hurdy-gurdy\n* [[Dulcigurdy]], a type of hurdy-gurdy that is fingered instead of having a keybox\n* [[Bowed clavier|Geigenwerk]], a bowed clavier originally produced in Germany (1751)\n* [[Kaisatsuko]], a two-string experimental keyless hurdy-gurdy by a Japanese artist\n* [[Nyckelharpa]], a Swedish instrument structurally related to the hurdy-gurdy, but played with a bow\n* [[Recordings featuring the hurdy gurdy|Recordings featuring the hurdy-gurdy]]\n* [[Viola organista]], an instrument designed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], which is essentially a much larger version of the hurdy-gurdy\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Hurdy-gurdy}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Hurdy-Gurdy}}\n* [http://hurdygurdywiki.wiki-site.com General hurdy-gurdy reference wiki]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150105001354/http://www.gurdypedia.com/ Gurdypedia]\u2014compendium of hurdy-gurdy material around the web\n* [http://www.ted.com/talks/caroline_phillips_hurdy_gurdy_for_beginners.html Caroline Phillips: Hurdy-gurdy for beginners] (video, 00:05:41).

Listed at {{convert|6|ft|4|in}} tall and {{convert|200|lb}}, Hunt batted and threw [[right-handed]]. He overcame control problems to reach the major leagues with the Reds in 1961, starting games for the [[National League]] champions. He won [[The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award#1960-69|''The Sporting News'' Rookie Pitcher of the Year Award]] and appeared in the [[1961 World Series|World Series]], which the Reds lost in five games to the [[New York Yankees]]. However, his control problems resurfaced in the minor leagues after that, and he never appeared in another major league game. Following his career, he coached baseball and basketball at [[Morgan High School (Utah)|Morgan High School]] in [[Utah]] for 20 years.\n\n==Early life==\nHunt was born to Kenneth Sr. and Wanda Hunt in [[Ogden, Utah]]. He grew up in that city, getting named to the All-State [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] teams while attending [[Ogden High School]]. After high school, he received baseball and basketball scholarships to [[Brigham Young University]] but only went to the institution for a year at the time before starting his professional baseball career.<ref name=\"obit\">{{cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/deseretnews/obituary-print.aspx?page=lifestoryprint&pid=102206540|title=Kenneth Hunt Obituary|work=legacy.com|date=January 30, 2008|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://byucougars.com/athlete/baseball/110189/ken-hunt|title=Ken Hunt|work=BYU Cougars|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> He would later become the first [[Brigham Young Cougars|Cougar]] to make it to the major leagues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-almanac.com/college/brigham_young_university_baseball_players.shtml|title=Brigham Young University Baseball Players Who Made it to the Major Leagues|work=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHunt signed a contract with the [[Cincinnati Redlegs]] before the 1958 season after getting spotted by one of the [[Scout (sport)|scouts]] for Redlegs' [[General manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Gabe Paul]].<ref name=\"Hunt\">{{cite web|last=Maule|first=Tex|url=https://vault.si.com/vault/1961/06/12/the-odds-go-down-on-cincy|title=The Odds Go Down on Cincy|work=Sports Illustrated|date=June 12, 1961|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> He began his minor league career that year with the [[Class C (baseball)|Class C]] [[Visalia Redlegs]] of the [[California League]]. Hunt struggled with control, prompting Visalia manager [[Dave Bristol]] to phone the Redlegs' front office and ask, \"Do I really have to pitch this guy that often? They're gonna run me out of town.\" The front office told him to keep it up, believing the solution to Hunt's control problems was experience.<ref name=\"Hunt\"/> He spent the whole year with Visalia but did not stick in the starting rotation, only starting seven of his 21 games. 75 [[walk (baseball)|walks]] in 54 [[innings pitched]] contributed to a 2\u20145 [[Win-loss record (pitching)|record]] and an [[earned run average]] (ERA) of 9.00.<ref name=\"minors\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=hunt--002ken|title=Ken Hunt Minor League Statistics & History|website=Baseball-Reference|accessdate=March 13, 2020}}</ref> Next season, Hunt remained with Visalia. Once again, he had more walks (185) than innings pitched (150), and his record was 4\u201414. However, he lowered his ERA to 6.66 and [[Strikeout|struck out]] 160 batters.<ref name=\"minors\"/> Sometime in 1959, he married Carol Nelson; later, the couple had their marriage [[solemnization|solemnized]] at the [[Salt Lake Temple]].<ref name=\"obit\"/>\n\nThe repeated use began to pay off with the [[Columbia Reds]] of the [[Class A (baseball)|Class A]] [[South Atlantic League]] in 1960. Hunt shoved his walk total down to 134, even as his innings pitched rose to 211, in 30 starts.
