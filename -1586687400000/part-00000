{"title_page": "Coalition government", "text_new": "{{short description|Form of government}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2010}}\n{{politics}}\nA '''coalition government''' is a form of government in which political parties cooperate, reducing the dominance of any one party within that \"coalition\". The usual reason for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the [[election]]. A coalition government might also be created in a time of national difficulty or crisis (for example, during wartime or economic crisis) to give a government the high degree of perceived [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] or [[collective identity]], it can also play a role in diminishing internal political strife. In such times, parties have formed all-party coalitions ([[national unity government]]s, [[grand coalition]]s). If a coalition collapses, a [[Motion of Confidence|confidence vote]] is held or a [[motion of no confidence]] is taken.\n\n==Practice==\n{{original research section|date=June 2009}}\nWhen a general election does not produce a clear majority for a single party, parties either form coalition cabinets, supported by a parliamentary majority, or [[Minority government|minority cabinets]] which may consist of one or more parties. Cabinets based on a group of parties that command a majority in parliament tend to be more stable and long-lived than minority cabinets. While the former are prone to internal struggles, they have less reason to fear votes of no confidence. [[Majority government]]s based on a single party are typically even more stable, as long as their majority can be maintained.\n\n==Distribution==\n{{see also|List of countries with coalition governments}}\nCountries which often operate with coalition cabinets include: the [[Nordic countries]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kosovo]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]]. [[Switzerland]] has been ruled by a coalition of the four strongest parties in parliament from 1959 to 2008, called the \"[[Magic Formula]]\". Between 2010 and 2015, the [[United Kingdom]] also operated a formal coalition between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] parties, but this was unusual: the UK usually has a single-party majority government.\n\n===Coalitions composed of few parties===\n{{party politics}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\n\n{{see also|National Government (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom coalition government (disambiguation)}}\nIn the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], coalition governments (sometimes known as \"national governments\") usually have only been formed at times of national crisis. The most prominent was the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] of 1931 to 1940. There were multi-party coalitions during both [[world war]]s. Apart from this, when no party has had a majority, minority governments normally have been formed with one or more opposition parties agreeing to vote in favour of the legislation which governments need to function: for instance the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[James Callaghan]] formed [[Lib-Lab pact|a pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] from March 1977 until July 1978, after a series of by-election defeats had eroded Labour's majority of three seats which had been gained at the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]]. However, in the run-up to the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Labour opposition leader [[Tony Blair]] was in talks with [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[Paddy Ashdown]] about forming a coalition government if Labour failed to win a majority at the election; but there proved to be no need for a coalition as Labour won the election by a [[landslide victory|landslide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Making Minority Government Work:Hung Parliaments and the Challenges for Westminster and Whitehall|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/pdfs/making-minority-gov-work.pdf|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> The [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]] (Britain's first for [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|36 years]]), and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], led by [[David Cameron]], which had won the largest number of seats, formed a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in order to gain a parliamentary majority, ending 13 years of Labour government. This was the first time that the Conservatives and Lib Dems had made a power-sharing deal at Westminster.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2010/05/lib-dems-government-deal|title=Tories and Lib Dems enter full coalition government|magazine=The New Statesman}}</ref> It was also the first full coalition in Britain since 1945, having been formed 70 years virtually to the day after the establishment of [[Winston Churchill]]'s wartime coalition,<ref>Churchill became Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, [[David Cameron]] on 11 May 2010. Churchill formed his War Cabinet on 11 May: Winston S. Churchill (1949) ''Their Finest Hour''.</ref>\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats have entered into a coalition twice in the [[Scottish Parliament]], as well as twice in the [[Welsh Assembly]].\n\n====Germany====\nIn Germany, for instance, coalition government is the norm, as it is rare for either the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] together with their partners the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CDU/CSU), or the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), to win an unqualified majority in a national election. Thus, at the federal level, governments are formed with at least two parties. For example, [[Helmut Kohl]]'s CDU governed for years in coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP); from 1998 to 2005 [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]'s SPD was in power with the [[German Green Party|Greens]]; and from 2009 [[Angela Merkel]], CDU/CSU was in power with the FDP.\n\n\"Grand coalitions\" of the two large parties also occur, but these are relatively rare, as large parties usually prefer to associate with small ones. However, if none of the larger parties can receive enough votes to form their preferred coalition, a grand coalition might be their only choice for forming a government. This was the situation in Germany in 2005 when Angela Merkel became Chancellor: in early [[2005 German federal election|elections]], the CDU/CSU did not garner enough votes to form a majority coalition with the FDP; similarly the SPD and Greens did not have enough votes to continue with their formerly ruling coalition. A grand coalition government was subsequently forged between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. Partnerships like these typically involve carefully structured cabinets. The CDU/CSU ended up holding the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellery]] while the SPD took the majority of cabinet posts. Parties frequently make statements ahead of elections which coalitions they categorically reject, similar to election promises or shadow cabinets in other countries.\n\nIn Germany, coalitions rarely consist of more than two parties (CDU and CSU, two allies which always form a single [[caucus]], are in this regard considered a single party). However, in the 2010s coalitions on the state level increasingly included three different parties, often [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], Greens and one of the major parties or \"red red green\" coalitions of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], [[Linkspartei]] and Greens. By 2016, the Greens have joined governments on the state level in eleven coalitions in seven various constellations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://eu.boell.org/sites/default/files/greens_in_government.pdf|title=German Greens in Coalition Governments.

Since then, many political parties were formed in it, who mainly work with each other to form coalition governments. Currently the country is governed by the [[My Step Alliance]] coalition after successfully gaining a majority in the [[National Assembly of Armenia]] following the [[2018 Armenian parliamentary election]].\n\n====Australia====\nIn federal [[Politics of Australia|Australian politics]], the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]], [[National Party of Australia|National]], [[Country Liberal Party|Country Liberal]] and [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National]] parties are united in a coalition, known simply as [[Coalition (Australia)|the Coalition]]. The Coalition has become so stable, at least at the federal level, that in practice the lower house of Parliament has become a [[two-party system|two-party]] house, with the Coalition and the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] being the major parties. This coalition is also found in the states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]] the Liberal and National parties compete separately, while in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]] the two parties have merged, forming the Country Liberal Party, in 1978, and the Liberal National Party, in 2008, respectively.\n\nThe other federal coalition has been:\n*[[United Australia Party|United Australia]]\u2013[[National Country Party|Country]]\u2013Independents coalition in [[1940 Australian federal election|1940]]\n*In [[Tasmanian Government|Tasmania]]:\n**Liberal\u2013Greens coalition in [[1996 Tasmanian state election|1996]].\n**Labor\u2013Greens coalitions formed in [[1989 Tasmanian state election|1989]] and [[2010 Tasmanian state election|2010]].\n*In the [[ACT Government|Australian Capital Territory]]:\n**Liberal\u2013[[Independent (politician)|Independent]] coalition in [[1998 Australian Capital Territory general election|1998]].\n**Labor\u2013Greens coalitions in [[2001 Australian Capital Territory general election|2001]] and [[2008 Australian Capital Territory general election|2008]].\n\n====Belgium====\nIn [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], where there are separate [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking and [[French language|French]]-speaking parties for each political grouping, coalition cabinets of up to six parties are common.\n\n====Canada====\nIn [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], the [[Great Coalition]] was formed in 1864 by the [[Clear Grits]], [[Parti bleu]], and [[Liberal-Conservative Party]]. During the [[First World War]], Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] attempted to form a coalition with the opposition Liberals to broaden support for controversial conscription legislation. The Liberal Party refused the offer but some of their members did [[crossing the floor|cross the floor]] and join the government. Although sometimes referred to as a coalition government, according to the definition above, it was not. It was disbanded after the end of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/precedents-from-around-the-world-1.876563|title=Coalition Government: Precedents from around the world|publisher=CBC News|date=2010-05-13|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[1919 Ontario general election|1919 Ontario election]], the [[United Farmers of Ontario]] and the [[Labour Party of Canada|Labour Party]], together with three independent MLAs, formed a coalition that governed [[Ontario]] until 1923.\n\nIn [[British Columbia]], the governing Liberals formed a coalition with the opposition Conservatives in order to prevent the surging, left-wing [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] from taking power in the [[1941 British Columbia general election]]. Liberal premier [[Duff Pattullo]] refused to form a coalition with the third-place Conservatives, so his party removed him. The Liberal\u2013Conservative coalition introduced a winner-take-all preferential voting system (the \"[[Alternative Vote]]\") in the hopes that their supporters would rank the other party as their second preference; however, this strategy did not take CCF second preferences into account. In the [[1952 British Columbia general election]], to the surprise of many, the right-wing populist [[BC Social Credit Party]] won a minority. They were able to win a majority in the subsequent election as Liberal and Conservative supporters shifted their anti-CCF vote to Social Credit.\n\nManitoba has had more formal coalition governments than any other province. Following gains by the United Farmer's/Progressive movement elsewhere in the country, the [[United Farmers of Manitoba]] unexpectedly won the 1921 election. Like their counterparts in Ontario, they had not expected to win and did not have a leader. They asked [[John Bracken]], a professor in animal husbandry, to become leader and premier. Bracken changed the party's name to the [[Progressive Party of Manitoba]]. During the Great Depression, Bracken survived at a time when other premiers were being defeated by forming a coalition government with the Manitoba Liberals (eventually, the two parties would merge into the [[Manitoba Liberal Party#Liberal-Progressive Party: Merger with the Progressives|Liberal-Progressive Party of Manitoba]], and decades later, the party would change its name to the [[Manitoba Liberal Party]]). In 1940, Bracken formed a wartime coalition government with almost every party in the Manitoba Legislature (the Conservatives, CCF, and Social Credit; however, the CCF broke with the coalition after a few years over policy differences). The only party not included was the small, communist [[Labor-Progressive Party]], which had a handful of seats.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, NDP premier [[Roy Romanow]] formed a formal coalition with the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party|Saskatchewan Liberals]] in 1999 after being reduced to a minority. After two years, the newly elected Liberal leader David Karwacki  ordered the coalition be disbanded, the Liberal caucus disagreed with him and left the Liberals to run as New Democrats in the upcoming election. The [[Saskatchewan NDP]] was re-elected with a majority under its new leader [[Lorne Calvert]], while the Saskatchewan Liberals lost their remaining seats and have not been competitive in the province since.\n\nAccording to historian [[Christopher Moore (Canadian historian)|Christopher Moore]], coalition governments in Canada became much less possible in 1919, when the leaders of parties were no longer chosen by elected MPs but instead began to be chosen by party members. Such a manner of leadership election had never been tried in any parliamentary system before. According to Moore, as long as that kind of leadership selection process remains in place and concentrates power in the hands of the leader, as opposed to backbenchers, then coalition governments will be very difficult to form. Moore shows that the diffusion of power within a party tends to also lead to a diffusion of power in the parliament in which that party operates, thereby making coalitions more likely.<ref name=Moore-1>{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Christopher|year=2011|title=Come together|journal=[[Canada's History]]|issue=June\u2013July 2011|pages=53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2008\u201309 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], two of Canada's opposition parties signed an agreement to form what would become the country's second coalition government since [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]] if the minority Conservative government was defeated on a vote of non-confidence,<ref>{{cite news|title=Coalition Set To Topple Canada PM|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122818032317670973?mod=googlenews_wsj|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2008-12-02|author=Menon, Nirmala}}</ref> unseating [[Stephen Harper]] as Prime Minister. The agreement outlined a formal coalition consisting of two opposition parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]. The [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] agreed to support the proposed coalition on confidence matters for 18 months. In the end, parliament was [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogued]] by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], and the coalition dispersed before parliament was reconvened.\n\n====Denmark====\nFrom the creation of the [[Folketing]] in 1849 through the introduction of [[proportional representation]] in 1918, there were only single-party governments in Denmark. [[Thorvald Stauning]] formed his [[Stauning II Cabinet|second government]] and Denmark's first coalition government in 1929. With the exception of a string of one-party governments during the 1970s, the norm since 1929 has been coalition governments. Every government from 1982 until the [[2015 Danish general election|2015 elections]] were coalitions. The most recent coalition was [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen III Cabinet|L\u00f8kke's third government]], which was replaced by the one-party [[Frederiksen Cabinet|Frederiksen government]] in 2019.\n\nWhen the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] under Stauning won 46% of the votes in the [[1935 Danish Folketing election|1935 election]], this was the closest any party has gotten to winning an outright majority in parliament. One party has thus never held a majority alone, and even one-party governments since 1918 have needed the [[Confidence and supply|support]] of at least one other party to govern. For example, the current government consists only of the Social Democrats, but also relies on the support of the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]], the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], and the [[Red\u2013Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red\u2013Green Alliance]].\n\n====Finland====\nIn [[Politics of Finland|Finland]], no party has had an absolute majority in the parliament since independence, and multi-party coalitions have been the norm. Finland experienced its most stable government ([[Paavo Lipponen's first cabinet|Lipponen I]] and [[Paavo Lipponen's second cabinet|II]]) since [[Finland's declaration of independence|independence]] with a five-party governing coalition, a so-called \"rainbow government\". The Lipponen cabinets set the stability record and were unusual in the respect that both the centre-left (SDP) and radical left-wing (Left Alliance) parties sat in the government with the major centre-right party (National Coalition). The [[Jyrki Katainen's cabinet|Katainen cabinet]] was also a rainbow coalition of a total of five parties.\n\n====India====\nSince India's Independence on 15 August 1947, [[Indian National Congress]], the major political party instrumental in [[Indian independence movement]], ruled the nation. The first Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], second PM [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and the third PM [[Indira Gandhi]], all were from the Congress party. However, [[Raj Narain]], who had unsuccessfully contested election against Indira from the constituency of [[Rae Bareilly]] in 1971, lodged a case, alleging electoral malpractices. In June 1975, Indira was found guilty and barred by High Court from holding public office for six years. In response, an ungracious Emergency was declared under the pretext of national security. The [[1977 Indian general election|next election's result]] was that [[Politics of India|India]]'s first-ever coalition government was formed at the national level under the Prime Ministership of [[Morarji Desai]], which was also the first non-Congress national government, which existed from 24 March 1977 to 15 July 1979, headed by the [[Janata Party]],<ref name=\"UK\">{{cite news|title=OBITUARY: Morarji Desai|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-morarji-desai-1615165.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|author=Kuldip Singh|date=1995-04-11|accessdate=2009-06-27}}</ref> an amalgam of political parties opposed to Emergency imposed between 1975 and 1977. As the popularity of Janata Party dwindled, Morarji Desai had to resign and [[Charan Singh]], a rival of Desai became the fifth PM. However, due to lack of support, this coalition government did not complete its five-year term.\n\nCongress returned to the power in 1980 under Indira Gandhi, and later under [[Rajiv Gandhi]] as the 6th PM. However, the next [[1989 Indian general election|general election of 1989]] once again brought a coalition government under [[National Front (India)|National Front]], which lasted until 1991, with two Prime Ministers, the second one being supported by Congress. The 1991 election resulted in a Congress led stable [[minority government]] for five years. The next 11th [[Lok Sabha|parliament]] produced three Prime Ministers in two years and forced the country back to the polls in 1998. The first successful coalition government in India which completed the whole 5-year term was the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] with [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] as PM from 1999 to 2004. Then another coalition, Congress led [[United Progressive Alliance]], consisting of 13 separate parties ruled India for two terms from 2004 to 2014 with [[Manmohan Singh]] as PM. However, in the [[2014 Indian general election|16th general election]] in May 2014, BJP secured majority on its own (first party to do so since 1984 election) and National Democratic Alliance came into power, with [[Narendra Modi]] as Prime Minister. In 2019, Narendra Modi got re-elected as Prime Minister for the second time as National Democratic Alliance again secured majority in the [[2019 Indian general election|17th general election]].\n\n====Indonesia====\nAs a result of the [[Fall of Suharto|toppling of Suharto]], political freedom is significantly increased. Compared to only three parties allowed to exist in the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era, a total of 48 political parties participated in the [[1999 Indonesian legislative election|1999 election]], a total of 24 parties in the [[2004 Indonesian legislative election|2004 election]], 38 parties in the [[2009 Indonesian legislative election|2009 election]], and 15 parties in the [[2014 Indonesian legislative election|2014 election]]. There are no majority winner of those elections and coalition governments are inevitable. The current government is a coalition of seven parties led by the [[Indonesian Democratic Party \u2013 Struggle|PDIP]] and [[Party of the Functional Groups|Golkar]].\n\n====Ireland====\nIn [[Republic of Ireland]], coalition governments are quite common; not since 1977 has a single party been able to form a majority government. Coalitions are the typically formed of two or more parties always consisting of one of the two biggest parties, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]], and one or more smaller parties or independent members of parliament. The current government consists of a minority Fine Gael government, supported by a [[confidence and supply]] arrangement with Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nIreland's first coalition government was formed in [[1948 Irish general election|1948]]. Ireland has had consecutive coalition governments since the [[1989 Irish general election|1989 general election]], excluding two brief Fianna F\u00e1il minority administrations in 1994 and 2011 that followed the withdrawal of their coalition partners from government. Before 1989, Fianna F\u00e1il had opposed participation in coalition governments, preferring single-party minority government instead.\n\nIrish coalition governments have traditionally been based on one of two large blocs in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]: either Fianna F\u00e1il in coalition with smaller parties or independents, or Fine Gael and the Labour Party in coalition, sometimes with smaller parties. The only exception to these traditional alliances was the [[23rd Government of Ireland]], comprising Fianna F\u00e1il and the Labour Party, which ruled between 1993 and 1994. The [[Government of the 31st D\u00e1il]], though a traditional Fine Gael\u2013Labour coalition, resembles a [[grand coalition]], due to the collapse of the Fianna F\u00e1il to third place among parties in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n\n====Israel====\nA similar situation exists in [[Politics of Israel|Israel]], which typically has at least 10 parties holding representation in the [[Knesset]]. The only faction to ever gain the majority of Knesset seats was [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]], an alliance of the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] and [[Mapam]] that held an absolute majority for a brief period from 1968 to 1969. Historically, control of the Israeli government has alternated between periods of rule by the right-wing [[Likud]] in coalition with several right-wing and religious parties and periods of rule by the center-left Labor in coalition with several left-wing parties. [[Ariel Sharon]]'s formation of the centrist [[Kadima]] party in 2006 drew support from former Labor and Likud members, and Kadima ruled in coalition with several other parties.\n\nIsrael also formed a [[national unity government]] from [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984\u20131988]]. The premiership and foreign ministry portfolio were held by the head of each party for two years, and they switched roles in 1986.\n\n====Japan====\nPost-World War II [[Politics of Japan|Japan]] has historically been dominated by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], but there was a brief coalition government formed after the [[1993 Japanese general election|1993 election]] following LDP's first loss of its overall [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] majority since 1955, winning only 223 out of 511 seats. The LDP government was replaced by an eight-party coalition government, which consisted of all of the previous opposition parties excluding the [[Japanese Communist Party]], who together controlled 243 seats. Every Japanese government since then has been a coalition government in one way or another.\n\n==== New Zealand ====\n{{Main|Electoral system of New Zealand#MMP in New Zealand}}\n[[MMP representation|MMP]] was introduced in [[New Zealand]] in [[1996 New Zealand general election|the 1996 election]]. \nIn order to get into power, parties need to get a total of 50% of the 121 seats in parliament \u2013 61. Since no parties have ever gotten a full majority, they must form coalitions with other parties. For example, during the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], [[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour]] got 46 seats and [[New Zealand First]] got nine. The two formed a [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Coalition Government]] with [[confidence and supply]] from the [[Green Party (New Zealand)|Green Party]] which got eight seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/full-video-nz-first-leader-winston-peters-announces-next-government.html |title=Full video: NZ First leader Winston Peters announces next Government |author=Chapman, Grant |date=19 October 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/an-historic-moment-for-the-green-party-james-shaw.html |title=An 'historic moment' for the Green Party \u2013 James Shaw |author=Hurley, Emma |date=19 October 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Spain ====\nSince 2015, there are coalition governments in municipalities, autonomous regions and, since 2020 (coming from the [[November 2019 Spanish general election]]), in the Spanish Government. There are two ways of conforming them: all of them based on a program and its institutional architecture, one consists on distributing the different areas of government between the parties conforming the coalition and the other one is, like in the Valencian Community,<ref>{{cite web |title=Generalitat Valenciana's political structure |website=gvaoberta.gva.es |url=http://www.gvaoberta.gva.es/es/estructura-organica |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> where the ministries are structured with members of all the political parties being represented, so that conflicts that may occur are regarding competences and not fights between parties.\n\n====Turkey ====\nThe first Turkish coalition was in 1961, i.e.,the [[27th government of Turkey]]. Up 2020 there were 18 coalition governments (excluding 5 [[technical government]]), the last one being the [[63rd government of Turkey]] in 2015. The prime ministers of the coalition governments were; [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] (3), [[Suat Hayri \u00dcrg\u00fcpl\u00fc]] (1), [[B\u00fclent Ecevit]] (3), [[Sadi Irmak]] (1), [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]] (3), [[Tansu \u00c7iller]] (3), [[ Mesut Y\u0131lmaz]] (2), [[Necmettin Erbakan]] (1) and [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu]] (1).\n\n==== Uruguay ====\n\nSince the [[1989 Uruguayan general election|1989 election]], there have been 4 coalition governments, all including at least both the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]] and the liberal [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]]. The first one was after the election of the blanco [[Luis Alberto Lacalle]] and lasted until 1992 due to policy disagreements, the longest lasting coalition was the Colorado-led coalition under the second government of [[Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti]], in which the national leader [[Alberto Volont\u00e9]] was frequently described as a \"Prime Minister\", the next coalition (under president [[Jorge Batlle]]) was also Colorado-led, but it lasted only until after the [[2002 Uruguay banking crisis]], when the blancos abandoned the government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/politica/lacalle-herrera-batlle-gobernar-coalicion.html|title=De Lacalle Herrera a Batlle: c\u00f3mo gobernar en coalici\u00f3n|last=ElPais|website=Diario EL PAIS Uruguay|language=spanish|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> After the [[2019 Uruguayan general election]], the blanco [[Luis Lacalle Pou]] formed the [[Coalici\u00f3n Multicolor|coalici\u00f3n multicolor]], composed of his own National Party, the liberal Colorado Party, the right wing populist [[Open Cabildo (Uruguay)|Open Cabildo]] and the center left [[Independent Party (Uruguay)|Independent Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/es/los-desaf%C3%ADos-de-lacalle-el-nuevo-presidente-del-pa%C3%ADs-m%C3%A1s-estable-de-latinoam%C3%A9rica/a-51477669|title=Los desaf\u00edos de Lacalle, el nuevo presidente del pa\u00eds m\u00e1s estable de Latinoam\u00e9rica {{!}} DW {{!}} 29.11.2019|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=es-ES|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nAdvocates of proportional representation suggest that a coalition government leads to more consensus-based politics, as a government comprising differing parties (often based on different ideologies) need to compromise about governmental policy. Another stated advantage is that a coalition government better reflects the popular opinion of the [[Constituency|electorate]] within a country.<ref name=\"Moore-1\"/>\n\nThose who disapprove of coalition governments believe that such governments have a tendency to be fractious and prone to disharmony, as their component parties hold differing beliefs and thus may not always agree on policy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moury |first1=Catherine |last2=Timmermans |first2=Arco |title=Inter-party conflict management in coalition governments: Analyzing the role of coalition agreements in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands |journal=Politics and Governance |date=25 July 2013 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=117\u2013131 |doi=10.17645/pag.v1i2.94 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/94 |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Sometimes the results of an election mean that the coalitions which are mathematically most probable are ideologically infeasible, for example in [[Flanders]] or [[Northern Ireland]]. A second difficulty might be the ability of minor parties to play \"[[kingmaker]]\" and, particularly in close elections, gain far more power in exchange for their support than the size of their vote would otherwise justify.\n\nCoalition governments have also been criticized{{By whom|date=May 2014}} for sustaining a [[consensus]] on issues when disagreement and the consequent discussion would be more fruitful. To forge a consensus, the leaders of ruling coalition parties can agree to silence their disagreements on an issue to unify the coalition against the opposition. The coalition partners, if they control the parliamentary majority, can collude to make the parliamentary discussion on the issue irrelevant by consistently disregarding the arguments of the opposition and voting against the opposition's proposals \u2014 even if there is disagreement within the ruling parties about the issue.\n\nPowerful parties can also act in an [[Oligocracy|oligocratic]] way to form an alliance to stifle the growth of emerging parties. Of course, such an event is rare in coalition governments when compared to [[two-party system]]s, which typically exist because of stifling of the growth of emerging parties, often through discriminatory [[nomination rules]] regulations and [[plurality voting system]]s, and so on.\n\nA single, more powerful party can shape the policies of the coalition disproportionately. Smaller or less powerful parties can be intimidated to not openly disagree. In order to maintain the coalition, they would have to vote against their own party's platform in the parliament. If they do not, the party has to leave the government and loses executive power. However, this is contradicted by the \"kingmaker\" factor mentioned above.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\n* [[Collaborative leadership]]\n* [[Electoral alliance]]\n* [[Electoral fusion]]\n* [[Hung parliament]]\n* [[List of democracy and election-related topics]]\n* [[List of countries with coalition governments]]\n* [[Majority government]]\n* [[Minority government]]\n* [[Plurality voting system]]\n* [[Political coalition]]\n* [[Political organisation]]\n* [[:Category:Political party alliances]]\n* [[Popular front]]\n* [[Unholy Alliance (geopolitical)|Unholy alliance]]\n* [[United front]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Coalition Spectrum navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coalition Government}}\n[[Category:Coalition governments]]\n\n[[cs:Koalice#Vl\u00e1dn\u00ed koalice]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Form of government}}\n{{more citations needed|date=May 2010}}\n{{politics}}\nA '''coalition government''' is a form of government in which political parties cooperate, reducing the dominance of any one party within that \"coalition\". The usual reason for this arrangement is that no party on its own can achieve a majority in the [[election]]. A coalition government might also be created in a time of national difficulty or crisis (for example, during wartime or economic crisis) to give a government the high degree of perceived [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] or [[collective identity]], it can also play a role in diminishing internal political strife. In such times, parties have formed all-party coalitions ([[national unity government]]s, [[grand coalition]]s). If a coalition collapses, a [[Motion of Confidence|confidence vote]] is held or a [[motion of no confidence]] is taken.\n\n==Practice==\n{{original research section|date=June 2009}}\nWhen a general election does not produce a clear majority for a single party, parties either form coalition cabinets, supported by a parliamentary majority, or [[Minority government|minority cabinets]] which may consist of one or more parties. Cabinets based on a group of parties that command a majority in parliament tend to be more stable and long-lived than minority cabinets. While the former are prone to internal struggles, they have less reason to fear votes of no confidence. [[Majority government]]s based on a single party are typically even more stable, as long as their majority can be maintained.\n\n==Distribution==\n{{see also|List of countries with coalition governments}}\nCountries which often operate with coalition cabinets include: the [[Nordic countries]], the [[Benelux]] countries, [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kosovo]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Lebanon]], [[Nepal]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Turkey]] and [[Ukraine]]. [[Switzerland]] has been ruled by a coalition of the four strongest parties in parliament from 1959 to 2008, called the \"[[Magic Formula]]\". Between 2010 and 2015, the [[United Kingdom]] also operated a formal coalition between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] parties, but this was unusual: the UK usually has a single-party majority government.\n\n===Coalitions composed of few parties===\n{{party politics}}\n\n====United Kingdom====\n\n{{see also|National Government (United Kingdom)|United Kingdom coalition government (disambiguation)}}\nIn the [[Politics of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], coalition governments (sometimes known as \"national governments\") usually have only been formed at times of national crisis. The most prominent was the [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] of 1931 to 1940. There were multi-party coalitions during both [[world war]]s. Apart from this, when no party has had a majority, minority governments normally have been formed with one or more opposition parties agreeing to vote in favour of the legislation which governments need to function: for instance the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government of [[James Callaghan]] formed [[Lib-Lab pact|a pact]] with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] from March 1977 until July 1978, after a series of by-election defeats had eroded Labour's majority of three seats which had been gained at the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 election]]. However, in the run-up to the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Labour opposition leader [[Tony Blair]] was in talks with [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader [[Paddy Ashdown]] about forming a coalition government if Labour failed to win a majority at the election; but there proved to be no need for a coalition as Labour won the election by a [[landslide victory|landslide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Making Minority Government Work:Hung Parliaments and the Challenges for Westminster and Whitehall|url=http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/pdfs/making-minority-gov-work.pdf|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2009-12-07}}</ref> The [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]] (Britain's first for [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|36 years]]), and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], led by [[David Cameron]], which had won the largest number of seats, formed a [[Cameron\u2013Clegg coalition|coalition]] with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in order to gain a parliamentary majority, ending 13 years of Labour government. This was the first time that the Conservatives and Lib Dems had made a power-sharing deal at Westminster.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2010/05/lib-dems-government-deal|title=Tories and Lib Dems enter full coalition government|magazine=The New Statesman}}</ref> It was also the first full coalition in Britain since 1945, having been formed 70 years virtually to the day after the establishment of [[Winston Churchill]]'s wartime coalition,<ref>Churchill became Prime Minister on 10 May 1940, [[David Cameron]] on 11 May 2010. Churchill formed his War Cabinet on 11 May: Winston S. Churchill (1949) ''Their Finest Hour''.</ref>\nLabour and the Liberal Democrats have entered into a coalition twice in the [[Scottish Parliament]], as well as twice in the [[Welsh Assembly]].\n\n====Germany====\nIn Germany, for instance, coalition government is the norm, as it is rare for either the [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany]] together with their partners the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria]] (CDU/CSU), or the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), to win an unqualified majority in a national election. Thus, at the federal level, governments are formed with at least two parties. For example, [[Helmut Kohl]]'s CDU governed for years in coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP); from 1998 to 2005 [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]]'s SPD was in power with the [[German Green Party|Greens]]; and from 2009 [[Angela Merkel]], CDU/CSU was in power with the FDP.\n\n\"Grand coalitions\" of the two large parties also occur, but these are relatively rare, as large parties usually prefer to associate with small ones. However, if none of the larger parties can receive enough votes to form their preferred coalition, a grand coalition might be their only choice for forming a government. This was the situation in Germany in 2005 when Angela Merkel became Chancellor: in early [[2005 German federal election|elections]], the CDU/CSU did not garner enough votes to form a majority coalition with the FDP; similarly the SPD and Greens did not have enough votes to continue with their formerly ruling coalition. A grand coalition government was subsequently forged between the CDU/CSU and the SPD. Partnerships like these typically involve carefully structured cabinets. The CDU/CSU ended up holding the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellery]] while the SPD took the majority of cabinet posts. Parties frequently make statements ahead of elections which coalitions they categorically reject, similar to election promises or shadow cabinets in other countries.\n\nIn Germany, coalitions rarely consist of more than two parties (CDU and CSU, two allies which always form a single [[caucus]], are in this regard considered a single party). However, in the 2010s coalitions on the state level increasingly included three different parties, often [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]], Greens and one of the major parties or \"red red green\" coalitions of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], [[Linkspartei]] and Greens. By 2016, the Greens have joined governments on the state level in eleven coalitions in seven various constellations.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://eu.boell.org/sites/default/files/greens_in_government.pdf|title=German Greens in Coalition Governments.

Since then, many political parties were formed in it, who mainly work with each other to form coalition governments. Currently the country is governed by the [[My Step Alliance]] coalition after successfully gaining a majority in the [[National Assembly of Armenia]] following the [[2018 Armenian parliamentary election]].\n\n====Australia====\nIn federal [[Politics of Australia|Australian politics]], the conservative [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]], [[National Party of Australia|National]], [[Country Liberal Party|Country Liberal]] and [[Liberal National Party of Queensland|Liberal National]] parties are united in a coalition, known simply as [[Coalition (Australia)|the Coalition]]. The Coalition has become so stable, at least at the federal level, that in practice the lower house of Parliament has become a [[two-party system|two-party]] house, with the Coalition and the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] being the major parties. This coalition is also found in the states of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]] the Liberal and National parties compete separately, while in the [[Northern Territory]] and [[Queensland]] the two parties have merged, forming the Country Liberal Party, in 1978, and the Liberal National Party, in 2008, respectively.\n\nThe other federal coalition has been:\n*[[United Australia Party|United Australia]]\u2013[[National Country Party|Country]]\u2013Independents coalition in [[1940 Australian federal election|1940]]\n*In [[Tasmanian Government|Tasmania]]:\n**Liberal\u2013Greens coalition in [[1996 Tasmanian state election|1996]].\n**Labor\u2013Greens coalitions formed in [[1989 Tasmanian state election|1989]] and [[2010 Tasmanian state election|2010]].\n*In the [[ACT Government|Australian Capital Territory]]:\n**Liberal\u2013[[Independent (politician)|Independent]] coalition in [[1998 Australian Capital Territory general election|1998]].\n**Labor\u2013Greens coalitions in [[2001 Australian Capital Territory general election|2001]] and [[2008 Australian Capital Territory general election|2008]].\n\n====Belgium====\nIn [[Politics of Belgium|Belgium]], where there are separate [[Dutch language|Dutch]]-speaking and [[French language|French]]-speaking parties for each political grouping, coalition cabinets of up to six parties are common.\n\n====Canada====\nIn [[Politics of Canada|Canada]], the [[Great Coalition]] was formed in 1864 by the [[Clear Grits]], [[Parti bleu]], and [[Liberal-Conservative Party]]. During the [[First World War]], Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] attempted to form a coalition with the opposition Liberals to broaden support for controversial conscription legislation. The Liberal Party refused the offer but some of their members did [[crossing the floor|cross the floor]] and join the government. Although sometimes referred to as a coalition government, according to the definition above, it was not. It was disbanded after the end of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/precedents-from-around-the-world-1.876563|title=Coalition Government: Precedents from around the world|publisher=CBC News|date=2010-05-13|accessdate=2009-05-14}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of the [[1919 Ontario general election|1919 Ontario election]], the [[United Farmers of Ontario]] and the [[Labour Party of Canada|Labour Party]], together with three independent MLAs, formed a coalition that governed [[Ontario]] until 1923.\n\nIn [[British Columbia]], the governing Liberals formed a coalition with the opposition Conservatives in order to prevent the surging, left-wing [[Cooperative Commonwealth Federation]] from taking power in the [[1941 British Columbia general election]]. Liberal premier [[Duff Pattullo]] refused to form a coalition with the third-place Conservatives, so his party removed him. The Liberal\u2013Conservative coalition introduced a winner-take-all preferential voting system (the \"[[Alternative Vote]]\") in the hopes that their supporters would rank the other party as their second preference; however, this strategy did not take CCF second preferences into account. In the [[1952 British Columbia general election]], to the surprise of many, the right-wing populist [[BC Social Credit Party]] won a minority. They were able to win a majority in the subsequent election as Liberal and Conservative supporters shifted their anti-CCF vote to Social Credit.\n\nManitoba has had more formal coalition governments than any other province. Following gains by the United Farmer's/Progressive movement elsewhere in the country, the [[United Farmers of Manitoba]] unexpectedly won the 1921 election. Like their counterparts in Ontario, they had not expected to win and did not have a leader. They asked [[John Bracken]], a professor in animal husbandry, to become leader and premier. Bracken changed the party's name to the [[Progressive Party of Manitoba]]. During the Great Depression, Bracken survived at a time when other premiers were being defeated by forming a coalition government with the Manitoba Liberals (eventually, the two parties would merge into the [[Manitoba Liberal Party#Liberal-Progressive Party: Merger with the Progressives|Liberal-Progressive Party of Manitoba]], and decades later, the party would change its name to the [[Manitoba Liberal Party]]). In 1940, Bracken formed a wartime coalition government with almost every party in the Manitoba Legislature (the Conservatives, CCF, and Social Credit; however, the CCF broke with the coalition after a few years over policy differences). The only party not included was the small, communist [[Labor-Progressive Party]], which had a handful of seats.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, NDP premier [[Roy Romanow]] formed a formal coalition with the [[Saskatchewan Liberal Party|Saskatchewan Liberals]] in 1999 after being reduced to a minority. After two years, the newly elected Liberal leader David Karwacki  ordered the coalition be disbanded, the Liberal caucus disagreed with him and left the Liberals to run as New Democrats in the upcoming election. The [[Saskatchewan NDP]] was re-elected with a majority under its new leader [[Lorne Calvert]], while the Saskatchewan Liberals lost their remaining seats and have not been competitive in the province since.\n\nAccording to historian [[Christopher Moore (Canadian historian)|Christopher Moore]], coalition governments in Canada became much less possible in 1919, when the leaders of parties were no longer chosen by elected MPs but instead began to be chosen by party members. Such a manner of leadership election had never been tried in any parliamentary system before. According to Moore, as long as that kind of leadership selection process remains in place and concentrates power in the hands of the leader, as opposed to backbenchers, then coalition governments will be very difficult to form. Moore shows that the diffusion of power within a party tends to also lead to a diffusion of power in the parliament in which that party operates, thereby making coalitions more likely.<ref name=Moore-1>{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Christopher|year=2011|title=Come together|journal=[[Canada's History]]|issue=June\u2013July 2011|pages=53\u201354}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[2008\u201309 Canadian parliamentary dispute]], two of Canada's opposition parties signed an agreement to form what would become the country's second coalition government since [[Canadian confederation|Confederation]] if the minority Conservative government was defeated on a vote of non-confidence,<ref>{{cite news|title=Coalition Set To Topple Canada PM|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122818032317670973?mod=googlenews_wsj|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=2008-12-02|accessdate=2008-12-02|author=Menon, Nirmala}}</ref> unseating [[Stephen Harper]] as Prime Minister. The agreement outlined a formal coalition consisting of two opposition parties, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]]. The [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] agreed to support the proposed coalition on confidence matters for 18 months. In the end, parliament was [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogued]] by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]], and the coalition dispersed before parliament was reconvened.\n\n====Denmark====\nFrom the creation of the [[Folketing]] in 1849 through the introduction of [[proportional representation]] in 1918, there were only single-party governments in Denmark. [[Thorvald Stauning]] formed his [[Stauning II Cabinet|second government]] and Denmark's first coalition government in 1929. With the exception of a string of one-party governments during the 1970s, the norm since 1929 has been coalition governments. Every government from 1982 until the [[2015 Danish general election|2015 elections]] were coalitions. The most recent coalition was [[Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen III Cabinet|L\u00f8kke's third government]], which was replaced by the one-party [[Frederiksen Cabinet|Frederiksen government]] in 2019.\n\nWhen the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] under Stauning won 46% of the votes in the [[1935 Danish Folketing election|1935 election]], this was the closest any party has gotten to winning an outright majority in parliament. One party has thus never held a majority alone, and even one-party governments since 1918 have needed the [[Confidence and supply|support]] of at least one other party to govern. For example, the current government consists only of the Social Democrats, but also relies on the support of the [[Danish Social Liberal Party|Social Liberal Party]], the [[Socialist People's Party (Denmark)|Socialist People's Party]], and the [[Red\u2013Green Alliance (Denmark)|Red\u2013Green Alliance]].\n\n====Finland====\nIn [[Politics of Finland|Finland]], no party has had an absolute majority in the parliament since independence, and multi-party coalitions have been the norm. Finland experienced its most stable government ([[Paavo Lipponen's first cabinet|Lipponen I]] and [[Paavo Lipponen's second cabinet|II]]) since [[Finland's declaration of independence|independence]] with a five-party governing coalition, a so-called \"rainbow government\". The Lipponen cabinets set the stability record and were unusual in the respect that both the centre-left (SDP) and radical left-wing (Left Alliance) parties sat in the government with the major centre-right party (National Coalition). The [[Jyrki Katainen's cabinet|Katainen cabinet]] was also a rainbow coalition of a total of five parties.\n\n====India====\nSince India's Independence on 15 August 1947, [[Indian National Congress]], the major political party instrumental in [[Indian independence movement]], ruled the nation. The first Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], second PM [[Lal Bahadur Shastri]] and the third PM [[Indira Gandhi]], all were from the Congress party. However, [[Raj Narain]], who had unsuccessfully contested election against Indira from the constituency of [[Rae Bareilly]] in 1971, lodged a case, alleging electoral malpractices. In June 1975, Indira was found guilty and barred by High Court from holding public office for six years. In response, an ungracious Emergency was declared under the pretext of national security. The [[1977 Indian general election|next election's result]] was that [[Politics of India|India]]'s first-ever coalition government was formed at the national level under the Prime Ministership of [[Morarji Desai]], which was also the first non-Congress national government, which existed from 24 March 1977 to 15 July 1979, headed by the [[Janata Party]],<ref name=\"UK\">{{cite news|title=OBITUARY: Morarji Desai|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-morarji-desai-1615165.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|author=Kuldip Singh|date=1995-04-11|accessdate=2009-06-27}}</ref> an amalgam of political parties opposed to Emergency imposed between 1975 and 1977. As the popularity of Janata Party dwindled, Morarji Desai had to resign and [[Charan Singh]], a rival of Desai became the fifth PM. However, due to lack of support, this coalition government did not complete its five-year term.\n\nCongress returned to the power in 1980 under Indira Gandhi, and later under [[Rajiv Gandhi]] as the 6th PM. However, the next [[1989 Indian general election|general election of 1989]] once again brought a coalition government under [[National Front (India)|National Front]], which lasted until 1991, with two Prime Ministers, the second one being supported by Congress. The 1991 election resulted in a Congress led stable [[minority government]] for five years. The next 11th [[Lok Sabha|parliament]] produced three Prime Ministers in two years and forced the country back to the polls in 1998. The first successful coalition government in India which completed the whole 5-year term was the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) led [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|National Democratic Alliance]] with [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] as PM from 1999 to 2004. Then another coalition, Congress led [[United Progressive Alliance]], consisting of 13 separate parties ruled India for two terms from 2004 to 2014 with [[Manmohan Singh]] as PM. However, in the [[2014 Indian general election|16th general election]] in May 2014, BJP secured majority on its own (first party to do so since 1984 election) and National Democratic Alliance came into power, with [[Narendra Modi]] as Prime Minister. In 2019, Narendra Modi got re-elected as Prime Minister for the second time as National Democratic Alliance again secured majority in the [[2019 Indian general election|17th general election]].\n\n====Indonesia====\nAs a result of the [[Fall of Suharto|toppling of Suharto]], political freedom is significantly increased. Compared to only three parties allowed to exist in the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era, a total of 48 political parties participated in the [[1999 Indonesian legislative election|1999 election]], a total of 24 parties in the [[2004 Indonesian legislative election|2004 election]], 38 parties in the [[2009 Indonesian legislative election|2009 election]], and 15 parties in the [[2014 Indonesian legislative election|2014 election]]. There are no majority winner of those elections and coalition governments are inevitable. The current government is a coalition of seven parties led by the [[Indonesian Democratic Party \u2013 Struggle|PDIP]] and [[Party of the Functional Groups|Golkar]].\n\n====Ireland====\nIn [[Republic of Ireland]], coalition governments are quite common; not since 1977 has a single party been able to form a majority government. Coalitions are the typically formed of two or more parties always consisting of one of the two biggest parties, [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and [[Fine Gael]], and one or more smaller parties or independent members of parliament. The current government consists of a minority Fine Gael government, supported by a [[confidence and supply]] arrangement with Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nIreland's first coalition government was formed in [[1948 Irish general election|1948]]. Ireland has had consecutive coalition governments since the [[1989 Irish general election|1989 general election]], excluding two brief Fianna F\u00e1il minority administrations in 1994 and 2011 that followed the withdrawal of their coalition partners from government. Before 1989, Fianna F\u00e1il had opposed participation in coalition governments, preferring single-party minority government instead.\n\nIrish coalition governments have traditionally been based on one of two large blocs in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]]: either Fianna F\u00e1il in coalition with smaller parties or independents, or Fine Gael and the Labour Party in coalition, sometimes with smaller parties. The only exception to these traditional alliances was the [[23rd Government of Ireland]], comprising Fianna F\u00e1il and the Labour Party, which ruled between 1993 and 1994. The [[Government of the 31st D\u00e1il]], though a traditional Fine Gael\u2013Labour coalition, resembles a [[grand coalition]], due to the collapse of the Fianna F\u00e1il to third place among parties in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n\n====Israel====\nA similar situation exists in [[Politics of Israel|Israel]], which typically has at least 10 parties holding representation in the [[Knesset]]. The only faction to ever gain the majority of Knesset seats was [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]], an alliance of the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]] and [[Mapam]] that held an absolute majority for a brief period from 1968 to 1969. Historically, control of the Israeli government has alternated between periods of rule by the right-wing [[Likud]] in coalition with several right-wing and religious parties and periods of rule by the center-left Labor in coalition with several left-wing parties. [[Ariel Sharon]]'s formation of the centrist [[Kadima]] party in 2006 drew support from former Labor and Likud members, and Kadima ruled in coalition with several other parties.\n\nIsrael also formed a [[national unity government]] from [[1984 Israeli legislative election|1984\u20131988]]. The premiership and foreign ministry portfolio were held by the head of each party for two years, and they switched roles in 1986.\n\n====Japan====\nPost-World War II [[Politics of Japan|Japan]] has historically been dominated by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], but there was a brief coalition government formed after the [[1993 Japanese general election|1993 election]] following LDP's first loss of its overall [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] majority since 1955, winning only 223 out of 511 seats. The LDP government was replaced by an eight-party coalition government, which consisted of all of the previous opposition parties excluding the [[Japanese Communist Party]], who together controlled 243 seats. Every Japanese government since then has been a coalition government in one way or another.\n\n==== New Zealand ====\n{{Main|Electoral system of New Zealand#MMP in New Zealand}}\n[[MMP representation|MMP]] was introduced in [[New Zealand]] in [[1996 New Zealand general election|the 1996 election]]. \nIn order to get into power, parties need to get a total of 50% of the 121 seats in parliament \u2013 61. Since no parties have ever gotten a full majority, they must form coalitions with other parties. For example, during the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], [[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour]] got 46 seats and [[New Zealand First]] got nine. The two formed a [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Coalition Government]] with [[confidence and supply]] from the [[Green Party (New Zealand)|Green Party]] which got eight seats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/full-video-nz-first-leader-winston-peters-announces-next-government.html |title=Full video: NZ First leader Winston Peters announces next Government |author=Chapman, Grant |date=19 October 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/an-historic-moment-for-the-green-party-james-shaw.html |title=An 'historic moment' for the Green Party \u2013 James Shaw |author=Hurley, Emma |date=19 October 2017 |work=[[Newshub]] |accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Spain ====\nSince 2015, there are coalition governments in municipalities, autonomous regions and, since 2020 (coming from the [[November 2019 Spanish general election]]), in the Spanish Government. There are two ways of conforming them: all of them based on a program and its institutional architecture, one consists on distributing the different areas of government between the parties conforming the coalition and the other one is, like in the Valencian Community,<ref>{{cite web |title=Generalitat Valenciana's political structure |website=gvaoberta.gva.es |url=http://www.gvaoberta.gva.es/es/estructura-organica |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> where the ministries are structured with members of all the political parties being represented, so that conflicts that may occur are regarding competences and not fights between parties.\n\n====Turkey ====\nThe first Turkish coalition was in 1961, i.e.,the [[27th government of Turkey]]. Up 20 2020 there were 18 coalition governments (excluding 5 [[technical government]]), the last one being the [[63rd government of Turkey]] in 2015. The prime ministers of the coalition governments were; [[\u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc]] (3), [[Suat Hayri \u00dcrg\u00fcpl\u00fc]] (1), [[B\u00fclent Ecevit]] (3), [[Sadi Irmak]] (1), [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]] (3), [[Tansu \u00c7iller]] (3), [[ Mesut Y\u0131lmaz]] (2), [[Necmettin Erbakan]] (1) and [[Ahmet Davuto\u011flu]] (1).\n\n==== Uruguay ====\n\nSince the [[1989 Uruguayan general election|1989 election]], there have been 4 coalition governments, all including at least both the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|National Party]] and the liberal [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]]. The first one was after the election of the blanco [[Luis Alberto Lacalle]] and lasted until 1992 due to policy disagreements, the longest lasting coalition was the Colorado-led coalition under the second government of [[Julio Mar\u00eda Sanguinetti]], in which the national leader [[Alberto Volont\u00e9]] was frequently described as a \"Prime Minister\", the next coalition (under president [[Jorge Batlle]]) was also Colorado-led, but it lasted only until after the [[2002 Uruguay banking crisis]], when the blancos abandoned the government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elpais.com.uy/informacion/politica/lacalle-herrera-batlle-gobernar-coalicion.html|title=De Lacalle Herrera a Batlle: c\u00f3mo gobernar en coalici\u00f3n|last=ElPais|website=Diario EL PAIS Uruguay|language=spanish|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> After the [[2019 Uruguayan general election]], the blanco [[Luis Lacalle Pou]] formed the [[Coalici\u00f3n Multicolor|coalici\u00f3n multicolor]], composed of his own National Party, the liberal Colorado Party, the right wing populist [[Open Cabildo (Uruguay)|Open Cabildo]] and the center left [[Independent Party (Uruguay)|Independent Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/es/los-desaf%C3%ADos-de-lacalle-el-nuevo-presidente-del-pa%C3%ADs-m%C3%A1s-estable-de-latinoam%C3%A9rica/a-51477669|title=Los desaf\u00edos de Lacalle, el nuevo presidente del pa\u00eds m\u00e1s estable de Latinoam\u00e9rica {{!}} DW {{!}} 29.11.2019|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|website=DW.COM|language=es-ES|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2014}}\nAdvocates of proportional representation suggest that a coalition government leads to more consensus-based politics, as a government comprising differing parties (often based on different ideologies) need to compromise about governmental policy. Another stated advantage is that a coalition government better reflects the popular opinion of the [[Constituency|electorate]] within a country.<ref name=\"Moore-1\"/>\n\nThose who disapprove of coalition governments believe that such governments have a tendency to be fractious and prone to disharmony, as their component parties hold differing beliefs and thus may not always agree on policy.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moury |first1=Catherine |last2=Timmermans |first2=Arco |title=Inter-party conflict management in coalition governments: Analyzing the role of coalition agreements in Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands |journal=Politics and Governance |date=25 July 2013 |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=117\u2013131 |doi=10.17645/pag.v1i2.94 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/94 |accessdate=4 September 2018}}</ref> Sometimes the results of an election mean that the coalitions which are mathematically most probable are ideologically infeasible, for example in [[Flanders]] or [[Northern Ireland]]. A second difficulty might be the ability of minor parties to play \"[[kingmaker]]\" and, particularly in close elections, gain far more power in exchange for their support than the size of their vote would otherwise justify.\n\nCoalition governments have also been criticized{{By whom|date=May 2014}} for sustaining a [[consensus]] on issues when disagreement and the consequent discussion would be more fruitful. To forge a consensus, the leaders of ruling coalition parties can agree to silence their disagreements on an issue to unify the coalition against the opposition. The coalition partners, if they control the parliamentary majority, can collude to make the parliamentary discussion on the issue irrelevant by consistently disregarding the arguments of the opposition and voting against the opposition's proposals \u2014 even if there is disagreement within the ruling parties about the issue.\n\nPowerful parties can also act in an [[Oligocracy|oligocratic]] way to form an alliance to stifle the growth of emerging parties. Of course, such an event is rare in coalition governments when compared to [[two-party system]]s, which typically exist because of stifling of the growth of emerging parties, often through discriminatory [[nomination rules]] regulations and [[plurality voting system]]s, and so on.\n\nA single, more powerful party can shape the policies of the coalition disproportionately. Smaller or less powerful parties can be intimidated to not openly disagree. In order to maintain the coalition, they would have to vote against their own party's platform in the parliament. If they do not, the party has to leave the government and loses executive power. However, this is contradicted by the \"kingmaker\" factor mentioned above.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n* [[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\n* [[Collaborative leadership]]\n* [[Electoral alliance]]\n* [[Electoral fusion]]\n* [[Hung parliament]]\n* [[List of democracy and election-related topics]]\n* [[List of countries with coalition governments]]\n* [[Majority government]]\n* [[Minority government]]\n* [[Plurality voting system]]\n* [[Political coalition]]\n* [[Political organisation]]\n* [[:Category:Political party alliances]]\n* [[Popular front]]\n* [[Unholy Alliance (geopolitical)|Unholy alliance]]\n* [[United front]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Coalition Spectrum navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Coalition Government}}\n[[Category:Coalition governments]]\n\n[[cs:Koalice#Vl\u00e1dn\u00ed koalice]]\n", "name_user": "Nedim Ardo\u011fa", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTurkey", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_government"}

The militia that later became the National Guard was first formed in the [[Colony of Virginia]] in 1607 and is the oldest uniformed military force founded in the [[New World]].

Uniformed officers of NOAA and PHS are paid on the same scale as members of the armed services with respective rank and time-in-grade. Additionally, PHS Officers are covered by the [[Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act]] and the [[Servicemembers Civil Relief Act]] (formerly the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act).\n\nPHS and NOAA consist of [[commissioned officer]]s only and have no [[warrant officer]] ranks or [[enlisted ranks]]. Commissioned officers of the PHS and NOAA may be militarized by the President.<ref>PHS is under Title 42 & 46 U.S.C.</ref> Because they are commissioned officers, they can be classified as [[prisoners of war]] under the [[Geneva Conventions]], if captured by a [[belligerent]] entity. The [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] (USC&GS), a predecessor to NOAA, originally began commissioning its officers so that if captured while engaged in battlefield surveying, they would be protected under the [[Law of Armed Conflict]] and could not be tried or executed as [[espionage|spies]]. The USC&GS Commissioned Officer Corps became the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps), upon the creation of the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA) on 13 July 1965, then became the NOAA Corps upon the creation of NOAA on 3 October 1970. The PHS traces its origins to [[Marine Hospital Service|a system of marine hospitals]] created by \"[[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]]\", passed by Congress in 1798; it adopted a military model of organization in 1871.<ref>''[[United States Code]].

It was removed from the Coast and Geodetic Survey and became a component of the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA) as the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps) upon the establishment of ESSA on 13 July 1965.

The Coast Guard is part of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] and has both military and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] duties. [[Title 14 of the United States Code|Title 14]] states that the Coast Guard is part of the armed forces at all times, making it the only branch of the military outside the Department of Defense. During a declared state of war, however, the President or Congress may direct that the Coast Guard operate as part of the Department of the Navy.<ref>{{usc|14|3}}</ref> The U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, along with the NOAA Commissioned Corps, operate under military rules with the exception of the applicability of the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]], to which they are subject only when militarized by executive order or while detailed to any component of the armed forces.<ref>{{Cite web|title=UCMJ S 802.

The [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] is an additional reserve military component of the Army and Air Force, respectively, and is composed of National Guard units, which operate under [[Title 32 of the United States Code|Title 32]] and under state authority as the [[Army National Guard]] and [[Air National Guard]]. The militia that later became the National Guard was first formed in the [[Colony of Virginia]] in 1607 and is the oldest uniformed military force founded in the [[New World]]. The National Guard can also be mobilized by the President to operate under Federal authority through [[Title 10 of the United States Code|Title 10]].

Uniformed officers of NOAA and PHS are paid on the same scale as members of the armed services with respective rank and time-in-grade. Additionally, PHS Officers are covered by the [[Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act]] and the [[Servicemembers Civil Relief Act]] (formerly the Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act).\n\nPHS and NOAA consist of [[commissioned officer]]s only and have no [[warrant officer]] ranks or [[enlisted ranks]]. Commissioned officers of the PHS and NOAA may be militarized by the President.<ref>PHS is under Title 42 & 46 U.S.C.</ref> Because they are commissioned officers, they can be classified as [[prisoners of war]] under the [[Geneva Conventions]], if captured by a [[belligerent]] entity. The [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]] (USC&GS), a predecessor to NOAA, originally began commissioning its officers so that if captured while engaged in battlefield surveying, they would be protected under the [[Law of Armed Conflict]] and could not be tried or executed as [[espionage|spies]]. The USC&GS Commissioned Officer Corps became the Environmental Science Services Administration Corps (ESSA Corps), upon the creation of the [[Environmental Science Services Administration]] (ESSA) on 13 July 1965, then became the NOAA Corps upon the creation of NOAA on 3 October 1970. The PHS traces its origins to [[Marine Hospital Service|a system of marine hospitals]] created by \"[[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]]\", passed by Congress in 1798; it adopted a military model of organization in 1871.<ref>''[[United States Code]].

It stars [[Jay Hernandez]], [[Derek Richardson (actor)|Derek Richardson]], [[Ey\u00fe\u00f3r Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsson]], and [[Barbara Nedelj\u00e1kov\u00e1]]. It was produced by Eli Roth, Mike Fleiss, and Chris Briggs. It is the first installment of the ''Hostel'' trilogy, followed by ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'' and ''[[Hostel: Part III]]''. A mysterious organization that tortures and kills kidnapped tourists preys upon three friends traveling across Europe.\n\n==Plot==\nCollege students Paxton and Josh are travelling across Europe with their Icelandic friend \u00d3li. In the [[Netherlands]], they visit an [[Amsterdam]] nightclub, followed by a [[brothel]]. Unable to get back into their hostel because of a curfew, they accept the offer of a man named Alexei to stay at his apartment. He convinces them that, instead of going to Barcelona, they should visit a hostel in [[Slovakia]] which is filled with beautiful women and few tourists in contrast to Barcelona, where they would have to compete with other tourists for the local women.\n\nThe three board a train to Slovakia, where they encounter a strange Dutch Businessman who touches Josh's leg. Josh yells at him, causing him to leave.\n\nArriving in Slovakia, they are impressed by the beauty of the town and the grandeur of the hostel and find their roommates are two beautiful women, Natalya and Svetlana. The women invite them to the spa, and later to the disco. Outside the disco for some fresh air, Josh has a run in with a gang of local criminal kids are [[Gypsie]]s. The Dutch Businessman intervenes to defend him. Josh buys him a beer and apologizes for his reaction on the train.\n\nPaxton and Josh have sex with Natalya and Svetlana, while \u00d3li leaves with the desk girl, Vala. The next morning, \u00d3li doesn't return, and cannot be contacted. The desk clerk tells them \u00d3li checked out. The two are then approached by a Japanese woman named Kana, who shows them a photo of \u00d3li and her friend Yuki, who is also missing. Later the group receive a message from \u00d3li with a supposed [[selfie]] claiming he has gone home. Elsewhere, \u00d3li is already killed and decapitated, while Yuki is being tortured. Josh is anxious to leave, but Paxton convinces him to stay one more night with Natalya and Svetlana. Both women later slip both men [[tranquilizer]]s, while making out. Josh feels sick, goes back to the hostel and faints on his bed. Also feeling sick, Paxton goes to the bathroom but takes the wrong way and ends up locked in the [[pantry]].\n\nJosh wakes up in a dungeon-like room, where the Dutch Businessman begins maiming him. Musing over his dream of becoming a surgeon, the Dutch Businessman drills holes into Josh's body, slices his [[achilles tendon]]s, then slits his throat with a scalpel.\n\nPaxton wakes up in the disco and returns to the hostel and learns that he had supposedly checked out and his backpack was already at the front desk. Irritated, Paxton argues he didn\u2019t check out and demands a room. In his new room, he is greeted by two women, who invite him to the spa in an eerily similar manner to Natalya and Svetlana. He finds Natalya and Svetlana and asks them if they know where Josh is. They answered he went to an \u201cart exhibit\u201d, to where Paxton asks to go too. Natalya agrees to lead him to Josh and takes him to an old factory. There, Paxton sees Josh's mutilated corpse being stitched together by the Dutch Businessman. He is then captured and dragged, passing by several rooms where other people are being gruesomely tortured. He is restrained in a chair and prepped to be tortured by a client named Johann.\n\nWhile cutting off Paxton's fingers, Johann unintentionally removes his restraints. As Paxton gets off the chair, Johann charges at him, but slips on the blood and falls over, severing his own leg with a chainsaw. Paxton reaches for a gun and shoots Johann in the head, then proceeds to kill a guard, then leaves the room. He passes by a room where a man is getting rid of the mutilated corpse by putting it into an incinerator, and kills him with a sledgehammer.\n\nHe then finds the elevator to the top floor and enters the dressing room, where he changes into business clothes and finds a business card for the Elite Hunting Club, which is an organization where rich people pay to kill and mutilate tourists.\n\nOn the way out, Paxton discovers Kana, who is being disfigured with a blow torch. Paxton kills the client and flees with Kana in a stolen car, pursued by guards. While driving, Paxton sees Natalya, Svetlana, and Alexei; he runs them over, killing them. The Gypsies delinquants intercept them and Paxton give the candies for them and more they killed the men of elite hunting with concretes. (What does this last sentence mean?)\n\nThe two make it to the train station. Kana, seeing her disfigured face, kills herself by leaping in front of an oncoming train. Taking advantage of the commotion, Paxton boards another train unnoticed. Aboard, Paxton hears the voice of the Dutch Businessman. When the train stops in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], Paxton follows him to a public restroom and kills him. He then boards another train.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nIn the Director's Cut, Paxton kidnaps the Dutch Businessman's daughter instead of killing him.

It stars [[Jay Hernandez]], [[Derek Richardson (actor)|Derek Richardson]], [[Ey\u00fe\u00f3r Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsson]], and [[Barbara Nedelj\u00e1kov\u00e1]]. It was produced by Eli Roth, Mike Fleiss, and Chris Briggs. It is the first installment of the ''Hostel'' trilogy, followed by ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'' and ''[[Hostel: Part III]]''. A mysterious organization that tortures and kills kidnapped tourists preys upon three friends traveling across Europe.\n\n==Plot==\nCollege students Paxton and Josh are travelling across Europe with their Icelandic friend \u00d3li. In the [[Netherlands]], they visit an [[Amsterdam]] nightclub, followed by a [[brothel]]. Unable to get back into their hostel because of a curfew, they accept the offer of a man named Alexei to stay at his apartment. He convinces them that, instead of going to Barcelona, they should visit a hostel in [[Slovakia]] which is filled with beautiful women and few tourists in contrast to Barcelona, where they would have to compete with other tourists for the local women.\n\nThe three board a train to Slovakia, where they encounter a strange Dutch Businessman who touches Josh's leg. Josh yells at him, causing him to leave.\n\nArriving in Slovakia, they are impressed by the beauty of the town and the grandeur of the hostel and find their roommates are two beautiful women, Natalya and Svetlana. The women invite them to the spa, and later to the disco. Outside the disco for some fresh air, Josh has a run in with a gang of local criminal kids are [[Gypsie]]s. The Dutch Businessman intervenes to defend him. Josh buys him a beer and apologizes for his reaction on the train.\n\nPaxton and Josh have sex with Natalya and Svetlana, while \u00d3li leaves with the desk girl, Vala. The next morning, \u00d3li doesn't return, and cannot be contacted. The desk clerk tells them \u00d3li checked out. The two are then approached by a Japanese woman named Kana, who shows them a photo of \u00d3li and her friend Yuki, who is also missing. Later the group receive a message from \u00d3li with a supposed [[selfie]] claiming he has gone home. Elsewhere, \u00d3li is already killed and decapitated, while Yuki is being tortured. Josh is anxious to leave, but Paxton convinces him to stay one more night with Natalya and Svetlana. Both women later slip both men [[tranquilizer]]s, while making out. Josh feels sick, goes back to the hostel and faints on his bed. Also feeling sick, Paxton goes to the bathroom but takes the wrong way and ends up locked in the [[pantry]].\n\nJosh wakes up in a dungeon-like room, where the Dutch Businessman begins maiming him. Musing over his dream of becoming a surgeon, the Dutch Businessman drills holes into Josh's body, slices his [[achilles tendon]]s, then slits his throat with a scalpel.\n\nPaxton wakes up in the disco and returns to the hostel and learns that he had supposedly checked out and his backpack was already at the front desk. Irritated, Paxton argues he didn\u2019t check out and demands a room. In his new room, he is greeted by two women, who invite him to the spa in an eerily similar manner to Natalya and Svetlana. He finds Natalya and Svetlana and asks them if they know where Josh is. They answered he went to an \u201cart exhibit\u201d, to where Paxton asks to go too. Natalya agrees to lead him to Josh and takes him to an old factory. There, Paxton sees Josh's mutilated corpse being stitched together by the Dutch Businessman. He is then captured and dragged, passing by several rooms where other people are being gruesomely tortured. He is restrained in a chair and prepped to be tortured by a client named Johann.\n\nWhile cutting off Paxton's fingers, Johann unintentionally removes his restraints. As Paxton gets off the chair, Johann charges at him, but slips on the blood and falls over, severing his own leg with a chainsaw. Paxton reaches for a gun and shoots Johann in the head, then proceeds to kill a guard, then leaves the room. He passes by a room where a man is getting rid of the mutilated corpse by putting it into an incinerator, and kills him with a sledgehammer.\n\nHe then finds the elevator to the top floor and enters the dressing room, where he changes into business clothes and finds a business card for the Elite Hunting Club, which is an organization where rich people pay to kill and mutilate tourists.\n\nOn the way out, Paxton discovers Kana, who is being disfigured with a blow torch. Paxton kills the client and flees with Kana in a stolen car, pursued by guards. While driving, Paxton sees Natalya, Svetlana, and Alexei; he runs them over, killing them. The Gypsies delinquants intercept them and Paxton give the candies for them and more they killed the men of elite hunting with concretes.\n\nThe two make it to the train station. Kana, seeing her disfigured face, kills herself by leaping in front of an oncoming train. Taking advantage of the commotion, Paxton boards another train unnoticed. Aboard, Paxton hears the voice of the Dutch Businessman. When the train stops in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], Paxton follows him to a public restroom and kills him. He then boards another train.\n\n===Alternate ending===\nIn the Director's Cut, Paxton kidnaps the Dutch Businessman's daughter instead of killing him. After finding her teddy bear in the restroom she was supposed to be in, the Dutch Businessman searches for his missing daughter, unaware that Paxton's train has just left.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Jay Hernandez]] as Paxton\n* [[Derek Richardson (actor)|Derek Richardson]] as Josh\n* [[Ey\u00fe\u00f3r Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsson]] as \u00d3li\n* [[Jennifer Lim (British actress)|Jennifer Lim]] as Kana\n* [[Barbara Nedelj\u00e1kov\u00e1]] as Natalya \n* Jana Kaderabkova as Svetlana\n* Jan Vlas\u00e1k as The Dutch Businessman\n* [[Rick Hoffman]] as The American Client\n* Keiko Seiko as Yuki\n* Lubomir Bukovy as Alexei\n* Jana Havlickova as Vala\n* Petr Jani\u0161 as Johan, the German Surgeon\n* [[Takashi Miike]] as The Japanese Sadist\n* Patrik Zigo as The Bubblegum Gang Leader\n* Milda \"Jedi\" Havlas as Desk Clerk Jedi\n* [[Miroslav T\u00e1borsk\u00fd]] as Police officer\n* Josef Bradna as The Butcher\n* [[Eli Roth]] as American Stoner\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nAfter the release of ''[[Cabin Fever (2002 film)|Cabin Fever]]'', Eli Roth was met with praise from several industry figures.
