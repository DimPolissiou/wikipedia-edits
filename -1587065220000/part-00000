Her first TV movie was called ''[[The Feminist and the Fuzz]]''. Although she is best known for comedy, most of these films were dramas, as when she starred opposite her ''Jeannie'' co-star Larry Hagman in ''[[A Howling in the Woods]]'' (1971).\n\nIn ''[[The Stranger Within]]'' (1974), Eden played housewife Ann Collins, a woman impregnated by extraterrestrials. Later, Eden played Liz Stonestreet, a former policewoman now private detective investigating the disappearance of a missing heiress, in a critically acclaimed TV movie ''[[Stonestreet: Who Killed the Centerfold Model?]]'' (1977).

This led to a [[Harper Valley PTA (TV series)|namesake television series]] in 1981. In both the movie and the TV series, Eden played the show's heroine, Stella Johnson. The show won 11 of its 13 time slots during its first season. It was a comedy version of ''[[Peyton Place (TV series)|Peyton Place]]'', with [[Anne Francine]] playing wealthy villain Flora Simpson Reilly.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In one episode, Stella dressed in a blue and gold genie costume and in another she played both Stella and her cousin Della Smith (similar to Jeannie's evil twin-sister character). The TV series ''[[Harper Valley PTA (TV series)|Harper Valley PTA]]'' began January 16, 1981, and was renamed simply ''Harper Valley'' when the show began its second season on October 29, 1981. During this time, Eden also became the spokeswoman for [[L'eggs]] [[pantyhose]] and appeared in a series of print ads and TV commercials for the brand from 1979 to 1983.<ref>[http://www.retroland.com/leggs/ L'eggs at \"Retroland\"]</ref>\n\n[[File:Barbara Eden Crop.jpg|thumb|Eden in 1987 (age 56) at a United Services Organization show aboard the amphibious assault ship USS ''Okinawa'']]\nFrom April 3 through September 16, 1984, Eden starred in the Lee Guber and Shelly Gross national production of the [[John Kander]] and [[Fred Ebb]] Tony Award-winning musical comedy ''[[Woman of the Year (musical)|Woman of the Year]]'', playing the role of Tess Harding Craig, alongside [[Don Chastain]] (as Sam Craig), and [[Marilyn Cooper]].

In her final episode, the character admits that her maiden name was \"LeeAnn Nelson\", which was a production gag, as \"Nelson\" was the surname of Hagman's character and Eden's character's married name in ''I Dream of Jeannie''. In 1991, she starred in the stage play ''[[Same Time, Next Year (play)|Same Time, Next Year]]'' with [[Wayne Rogers]], and reprised her role of Jeannie in a television movie of the week. In 1993, she starred in an 11-city national tour of the play ''[[Last of the Red Hot Lovers]]'' with [[Don Knotts]].\n\nEden starred in such musical comedies as ''[[Nite Club Confidential]]'' (playing the role of Kay Goodman, in 1996), ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Robert Goulet]], ''[[The Pajama Game]]'' with [[John Raitt]], and ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (musical)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' playing Lorelei Lee.
