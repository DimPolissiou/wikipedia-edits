The lawsuit does not aim to restrict the book's content or distribution, but to capture the proceeds Snowden earns from it. The book has been censored in China, with the removed content including comments about authoritarian states, privacy-supporting technologies, and the right to privacy.\n\n== Summary ==\n=== Part One ===\nSnowden recounts growing up in a patriotic military family in [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]] and moving to [[Crofton, Maryland]] just shy of his ninth birthday. In Crofton, his father worked as a chief warrant officer in the Aeronautical Engineering Division at Coast Guard Headquarters and his mother at the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). He was introduced to computers by his father, using his [[Commodore 64]] home computer. From around the age of twelve he became obsessed with the internet, using a dial-up Internet access and trying to spend his \"every waking moment\" online. He eventually learned computer programming and became a hacker as a teenager, taking his focus away from his schoolwork to the detriment of his grades. He recalls one instance of discovering a security flaw on the website of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. He called the lab to notify them of this and later received a call from a man thanking him and offering a job once he turned 18. Toward the end of his freshman year at [[Arundel High School]], Snowden's parents were getting divorced and sold their Crofton house. He moved into his mother's condo near [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott City]]. At the beginning of his sophomore year, he was unusually fatigued and was eventually diagnosed with [[infectious mononucleosis]]. He missed four months of classes, and was told he would have to repeat his sophomore year. Instead, he dropped out of Arundel High and enrolled at [[Anne Arundel Community College]] (AACC), taking classes two days a week. He also later passed the [[General Education Development]] (GED) exams at a high school near Baltimore, a promise he made to himself when he dropped out. Snowden started freelancing as a web designer for a woman from his Japanese class at AACC. He wanted to advance his career further, taking a [[Microsoft certification]] course at the Computer Career Institute of a [[Johns Hopkins University]] satellite campus. In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], Snowden joined the [[United States Army]] to show he wasn't \"just a brain in a jar\" and was on track to become a Special Forces sergeant through the [[Special Forces (United States Army)#Special Forces MOS descriptions|18X]] enlistment option but suffered stress fractures during training at [[Fort Benning]] in Georgia. Snowden says his greatest regret was his own \"reflexive, unquestioning support\" for the [[War on Terror]] and the resulting \"promulgation of secret policies, secret laws, secret courts and secret wars.\"\n\n[[File:Commodore64 ita.jpg|thumb|Snowden first became interested in computers by using his father's [[Commodore 64]] home computer.]]\n\nSnowden still wanted to serve his country and realized he had taken his talent for technology for granted, and began taking classes again at Anne Arundel Community College. Knowing he would need a high-level security clearance to work for an intelligence agency, he searched for jobs that would sponsor his application for the [[Single Scope Background Investigation]]. He became an employee at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s [[Center for Advanced Study of Language]], a research center sponsored by the NSA. Around the same time, he met his then-girlfriend [[Lindsay Mills]] through the site [[Hot or Not]]. He eventually passed the full-scope polygraph and successfully attained the TS/SCI security clearance, completing his final interview at the NSA's [[Friendship Annex]] when he was twenty-two years old.\n\n=== Part Two ===\nAfter attending a 2006 job fair at the Ritz-Carlton in [[Tysons Corner, Virginia]], Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA and was assigned to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]]. In March 2007, the CIA stationed Snowden with diplomatic cover in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], where he was responsible for maintaining computer-network security. In February 2009, Snowden resigned from the CIA.\n\nShortly after, Snowden took a job as contractor for the NSA in Japan, but was officially an employee of [[Perot Systems]] (which was acquired by [[Dell]] soon after his arrival). He worked at the NSA's Pacific Technical Center (PTC), at [[Yokota Air Base]]. His job there was \"helping to connect the NSA's systems architecture with the CIA's.\" On one occasion, the PTC hosted a conference featuring briefings given by experts from all the intelligence components. The conference concerned how the Chinese intelligence services were targeting the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and how the IC could respond. When the only technology briefer was unable to attend at the last minute, Snowden was selected to replace them in assessing China's surveillance capabilities. He stayed up all night preparing his presentation, sifting through top secret reports off the NSA network and the CIA network. He was stunned by the extent to which China was able to constantly collect, store, and analyze the billions of daily telephone and Internet communications of their over a billion citizenry. However, Snowden began to believe that it was impossible for the US to have so much information about what the Chinese were doing without having done some of the very same things itself. Snowden, however, admits that at the time he \"tamped down\" his unease and fully supported defensive and targeted surveillance. He was further suspicious when he, around the same time, read the ''Unclassified Report on the [[President's Surveillance Program]]''. His suspicion drove him to search for the classified report, but was unable to find it. It was only later, long after he had forgotten about it, that the classified version mistakenly appeared on his desktop. After reading the report, he says he spent months in a sad, low daze: {{cquote|I felt more adult than ever, but also cursed with the knowledge that all of us had been reduced to something like children, who\u2019d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision. I felt like a fraud, making excuses to Lindsay to explain my sullenness. I felt like a fool, as someone of supposedly serious technical skills who\u2019d somehow helped to build an essential component of this system without realizing its purpose. I felt used, as an employee of the IC who only now was realizing that all along I\u2019d been protecting not my country but the state. I felt, above all, violated.}}\n\nSnowden moved to [[Columbia, Maryland]] in 2011, still working for Dell but now attached again to the CIA. He had switched to a sales position, a move which he describes as a way to distract himself from his unease and begin to have a normal life. However, the rise of cloud computing disturbed Snowden. He began expressing his concerns to Lindsay. Around the same time, Snowden began experiencing intense dizziness and, eventually, his first epileptic seizure. Following a series of seizures, Snowden took a short-term disability leave from Dell. The final chapter of Part Two, \"On the Couch\", describes his time spent recovering on his mother's blue couch as well his thoughts on authoritarian states and privacy in the context of the 2011 [[Arab Spring]].\n\n=== Part Three ===\nIn March 2012, he began working at \"[[Kunia Regional SIGINT Operations Center|the Tunnel]]\", a former aircraft factory turned NSA facility located under a pineapple field in [[Kunia Camp, Hawaii|Kunia]], on the island of [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]]. He was working on a Dell contract for the NSA. Snowden moved to Hawaii for the more relaxed lifestyle and the less stressful duties of his new position, in an effort to lessen the triggers of his seizures. He was the sole employee of the Office of Information Sharing, where he worked as a [[SharePoint]] systems administrator. He began actively searching for the NSA's surveillance capabilities and abuses at this time. As part of his work, Snowden developed a system called Heartbeat which created an automated queue from the classified documents posted to the Intelligence Community's \"readboards\". Heartbeat would perpetually scan for new and unique documents and create a kind of [[News aggregator|aggregated newsfeed]] personalized for each employee, based on their interests and their security clearance. Heartbeat was highly comprehensive, accessing beyond the NSA's network into the networks of the CIA and the FBI as well as into the Department of Defense\u2019s top-secret [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System]]. Heartbeat's servers stored a copy of each scanned document, allowing Snowden to \"perform the kind of deep interagency searches that the heads of most agencies could only dream of.\" Snowden says that nearly all of the documents that he later leaked to journalists were received through Heartbeat.\n\n[[File:Edward Snowden's former house in Waipahu, Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Edward Snowden's former house in [[Waipahu, Hawaii]].]]\n\nIn \"Whistleblowing\", Snowden discusses the [[Constitution of the United States]] and argues that the Intelligence Community have \"hacked\" it by acting with impunity from the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary branch. He also discusses the history of whistleblowing and argues that the terms \"leaking\" and \"whistleblowing\" should not be used interchangeably because he believes \"leaking\" is done out of self-interest, not out of public interest.\n\nWhen Snowden decided to go public, he realized he would have to have documentation or he risked being doubted. He chose not to self-publish to avoid being \"lost among the crazy\" of people posting classified secrets to the Internet every day. He avoided [[WikiLeaks]] because he felt their new strategy of publishing leaks as they received them would be no different to him self-publishing. He felt a [[document dump]] was not appropriate as his leaks were too \"tangled and technical\". He considered ''[[The New York Times]]'' but was unimpressed with how [[Bill Keller]] intentionally delayed the reporting of the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]] until after George W. Bush's 2004 reelection. He chose a number of journalists to contact, primarily messaging documentarian [[Laura Poitras]] and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]]. He communicated with them over e-mail under the aliases \"Cincinnatus\", \"Citizenfour\" and \"Verax\". To stay anonymous, he went [[war-driving]], exploiting local Wi-Fi networks with an antenna and magnetic GPS sensor while driving in his car around Oahu. He used [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] and the Kismet mapping software, running on the [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]] operating system which allowed him to easily [[MAC spoofing|spoof]] his laptop's [[MAC address]].\n\nUnder the guise of compatibility testing, Snowden transferred documents from the Heartbeat server to outdated desktop Dell PCs from his office, then onto [[SD card]]s after [[Data_deduplication|deduplicating]], [[Data_compression|compressing]] and [[Encryption_software|encrypting]] them. He carried the SD cards out through security, hiding them inside a [[Rubik's Cube]], in his sock, in his cheek, and in his pocket. At home, he transferred them onto a single external drive which he left out in the open on his desk.\n\nHe left Dell on March 15, 2013 and began working as an \"infrastructure analyst\" at the National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) in Honolulu through a contractor job at [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The NTOC had access to [[XKEYSCORE]]. Snowden witnessed coworkers use XKEYSCORE to view information about their current and former lovers,  called [[LOVEINT]]. He also recalls one time that affected him, watching a personal video of a father and his young son. Between March\u2013May 2013, Snowden began rapidly preparing to leave the country, emptying his bank accounts and erasing and encrypting his old computers. He researched his safest and most conducive destination, narrowing it down to [[Hong Kong]]. The day after Lindsay left on a camping trip, Snowden took an emergency medical leave of absence from work, citing epilepsy. He brought four laptops with him: one for secure communications, one for normal communications, a decoy, and [[Air gap (networking)|a laptop that had never connected to any networks and would never be used to do so]]. He flew to Tokyo then to Hong Kong on May 20, 2013, paying in cash both times.\n\nHe stayed in the [[The Mira Hong Kong]] hotel, where Glenn and Laura met him on June 2, 2013. Between June 3\u2013June 9 in Snowden's hotel room, Glenn and his ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' colleague [[Ewen MacAskill]] interviewed Snowden, with Laura filming what would later feature in her Academy Award-winning documentary ''[[Citizenfour]]'' (2014). On June 5, ''The Guardian'' published Glenn's first story, on the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISA court]] warrant that ordered [[Verizon Business Network Services|Verizon]] to provide a daily feed to the NSA containing \"telephony metadata\". On June 6, ''The Guardian'' published Glenn's revelation of [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published Laura and [[Barton Gellman]]'s story on PRISM on June 7. Snowden's identity was revealed on June 9 through a video interview directed by Laura published on ''The Guardian''{{'}}s website. The U.S. government charged Snowden under the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] on June 14 and formally requested his extradition on June 21, Snowden's 30th birthday.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | total_width       = 280\n | image1            = Laura Poitras 2014.jpg\n | image2            = Glenn Greenwald 2014-01-20 001.jpg\n | footer            = [[Laura Poitras]] (left) and [[Glenn Greenwald]] (right) were both contacted by Edward Snowden anonymously over encrypted email.\n}}\n\nAccompanied by [[Sarah Harrison (journalist)|Sarah Harrison]] of [[WikiLeaks]], Snowden attempted to travel to [[Ecuador]] for political asylum. They planned to fly to Moscow, then to Havana, then to Caracas, then to [[Quito, Ecuador]] because they were unable to fly directly from Hong Kong and all of the other connecting flights traveled through United States airspace. They arrived at Moscow's [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] on June 23, but were taken aside and questioned by a man from Russia's [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB). The man asked Snowden to work for them, but Snowden rejected the offer and said he had no intention to stay in Russia. The man was surprised and informed Snowden that the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] had canceled his passport. He proceeded to ask Snowden to share information with them but he refused. Snowden was detained in Sheremetyevo for forty days, during which he applied to twenty-seven countries for political asylum but none offered. On August 1, the Russian government granted Snowden temporary asylum.\n\nThe book's penultimate 28th chapter is composed of entries from Lindsay Mills's 2013 diary. Snowden explained that no one but her had the experience or the right to recount that period of her life: \"the FBI interrogations, the surveillance, the press attention, the online harassment, the confusion and pain, the anger and sadness.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward Snowden|title=Permanent Record|date=September 17, 2019|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-250-23724-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the final chapter, \"Love and Exile\", Snowden expresses his feelings on the impact of his revelations, including ''[[ACLU v. Clapper]]'' and the EU's [[General Data Protection Regulation]], and his hopes for the future of technology and privacy. He also discusses adjusting to life in Moscow with Lindsay. In the chapter's final sentence, Snowden reveals he and Lindsay were married in 2017.\n\n== Civil lawsuit ==\nOn September 17, 2019, the [[Federal Government of the United States]] filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] against Snowden for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and NSA.<ref name=\"civilcharges20190917\">{{cite news |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/united-states-files-civil-lawsuit-against-edward-snowden |title=United States Files Civil Lawsuit Against Edward Snowden |date=September 17, 2019 |accessdate=September 17, 2019 |first1=Joshua |last1=Stueve |work=Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Eastern District of Virginia}}</ref> The complaint alleges that Snowden violated prepublication obligations related to the publication of his memoir ''Permanent Record''.

Parts of the book were removed, in violation of his publishing agreement. The Chinese version removed Snowden's observation on the motivations of Arab Spring protestors: \"The crowds were calling for an end to oppression, censorship, and precarity. They were declaring that in a truly just society, the people were not answerable to the government, the government was answerable to the people.\" The following section, in which Snowden comments on the nature of authoritarian states, was also largely censored. In the section, Snowden writes, \"Authoritarian states are typically not governments of laws, but governments of leaders, who demand loyalty from their subjects and are hostile to dissent.\" The Chinese version also censored Snowden's references to the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]], China's military cyber intelligence and its capabilities, China's [[Great Firewall]], as well Snowden's characterization of [[Hong Kong]] as having \"nominal autonomy\". The Chinese version censored topics not directly related to China as well, including Snowden's commentary on the [[right to privacy]]. Snowden invited his Twitter followers to help him create a \"correct and unabridged version\" of ''Permanent Record'' to be published freely online.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/12/edward-snowden-says-autobiography-permanent-record-censored-in-china |title=Edward Snowden says autobiography has been censored in China |last=Kuo |first=Lily |date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3037432/whistle-blower-edward-snowden-slams-china-censorship-his-book |title=Whistle-blower Edward Snowden slams China censorship of his book, vows to put uncut version online |last=Zhen |first=Liu |date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[South China Morning Post]] |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://qz.com/1746780/edward-snowden-calls-out-chinese-censorship-of-his-book/ |title=Edward Snowden blew the whistle on how Chinese censors scrubbed his book |last=Steger |first=Isabella |date=November 12, 2019 |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |accessdate=November 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' wrote, \"Snowden's book likely won't change the minds of his detractors, but he makes a strong case for his efforts.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/edward-snowden/permanent-record-snowden/ |title=Permanent Record by Edward Snowden |date=September 17, 2019 |website=[[Kirkus Reviews]] |accessdate=September 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Greg Myre]] of [[NPR]] wrote, \"Snowden has no new bombshells in his book.

The lawsuit does not aim to restrict the book's content or distribution, but to capture the proceeds Snowden earns from it. The book has been censored in China, with the removed content including comments about authoritarian states, privacy-supporting technologies, and the right to privacy.\n\n== Summary ==\n=== Part One ===\nSnowden recounts growing up in a patriotic military family in [[Elizabeth City, North Carolina]] and moving to [[Crofton, Maryland]] just shy of his ninth birthday. In Crofton, his father worked as a chief warrant officer in the Aeronautical Engineering Division at Coast Guard Headquarters and his mother at the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). He was introduced to computers by his father, using his [[Commodore 64]] home computer. From around the age of twelve he became obsessed with the internet, using a dial-up Internet access and trying to spend his \"every waking moment\" online. He eventually learned computer programming and became a hacker as a teenager, taking his focus away from his schoolwork to the detriment of his grades. He recalls one instance of discovering a security flaw on the website of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. He called the lab to notify them of this and later received a call from a man thanking him and offering a job once he turned 18. Toward the end of his freshman year at [[Arundel High School]], Snowden's parents were getting divorced and sold their Crofton house. He moved into his mother's condo near [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott City]]. At the beginning of his sophomore year, he was unusually fatigued and was eventually diagnosed with [[infectious mononucleosis]]. He missed four months of classes, and was told he would have to repeat his sophomore year. Instead, he dropped out of Arundel High and enrolled at [[Anne Arundel Community College]] (AACC), taking classes two days a week. He also later passed the [[General Education Development]] (GED) exams at a high school near Baltimore, a promise he made to himself when he dropped out. Snowden started freelancing as a web designer for a woman from his Japanese class at AACC. He wanted to advance his career further, taking a [[Microsoft certification]] course at the Computer Career Institute of a [[Johns Hopkins University]] satellite campus. In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], Snowden joined the [[United States Army]] to show he wasn't \"just a brain in a jar\" and was on track to become a Special Forces sergeant through the [[Special Forces (United States Army)#Special Forces MOS descriptions|18X]] enlistment option but suffered stress fractures during training at [[Fort Benning]] in Georgia. Snowden says his greatest regret was his own \"reflexive, unquestioning support\" for the [[War on Terror]] and the resulting \"promulgation of secret policies, secret laws, secret courts and secret wars.\"\n\n[[File:Commodore64 ita.jpg|thumb|Snowden first became interested in computers by using his father's [[Commodore 64]] home computer.]]\n\nSnowden still wanted to serve his country and realized he had taken his talent for technology for granted, and began taking classes again at Anne Arundel Community College. Knowing he would need a high-level security clearance to work for an intelligence agency, he searched for jobs that would sponsor his application for the [[Single Scope Background Investigation]]. He became an employee at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s [[Center for Advanced Study of Language]], a research center sponsored by the NSA. Around the same time, he met his then-girlfriend [[Lindsay Mills]] through the site [[Hot or Not]]. He eventually passed the full-scope polygraph and successfully attained the TS/SCI security clearance, completing his final interview at the NSA's [[Friendship Annex]] when he was twenty-two years old.\n\n=== Part Two ===\nAfter attending a 2006 job fair at the Ritz-Carlton in [[Tysons Corner, Virginia]], Snowden accepted an offer for a position at the CIA and was assigned to the global communications division at CIA headquarters in [[Langley, Virginia]]. In March 2007, the CIA stationed Snowden with diplomatic cover in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], where he was responsible for maintaining computer-network security. In February 2009, Snowden resigned from the CIA.\n\nShortly after, Snowden took a job as contractor for the NSA in Japan, but was officially an employee of [[Perot Systems]] (which was acquired by [[Dell]] soon after his arrival). He worked at the NSA's Pacific Technical Center (PTC), at [[Yokota Air Base]]. His job there was \"helping to connect the NSA's systems architecture with the CIA's.\" On one occasion, the PTC hosted a conference featuring briefings given by experts from all the intelligence components. The conference concerned how the Chinese intelligence services were targeting the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and how the IC could respond. When the only technology briefer was unable to attend at the last minute, Snowden was selected to replace them in assessing China's surveillance capabilities. He stayed up all night preparing his presentation, sifting through top secret reports off the NSA network and the CIA network. He was stunned by the extent to which China was able to constantly collect, store, and analyze the billions of daily telephone and Internet communications of their over a billion citizenry. However, Snowden began to believe that it was impossible for the US to have so much information about what the Chinese were doing without having done some of the very same things itself. Snowden, however, admits that at the time he \"tamped down\" his unease and fully supported defensive and targeted surveillance. He was further suspicious when he, around the same time, read the ''Unclassified Report on the [[President's Surveillance Program]]''. His suspicion drove him to search for the classified report, but was unable to find it. It was only later, long after he had forgotten about it, that the classified version mistakenly appeared on his desktop. After reading the report, he says he spent months in a sad, low daze: {{cquote|I felt more adult than ever, but also cursed with the knowledge that all of us had been reduced to something like children, who\u2019d be forced to live the rest of our lives under omniscient parental supervision. I felt like a fraud, making excuses to Lindsay to explain my sullenness. I felt like a fool, as someone of supposedly serious technical skills who\u2019d somehow helped to build an essential component of this system without realizing its purpose. I felt used, as an employee of the IC who only now was realizing that all along I\u2019d been protecting not my country but the state. I felt, above all, violated.}}\n\nSnowden moved to [[Columbia, Maryland]] in 2011, still working for Dell but now attached again to the CIA. He had switched to a sales position, a move which he describes as a way to distract himself from his unease and begin to have a normal life. However, the rise of cloud computing disturbed Snowden. He began expressing his concerns to Lindsay. Around the same time, Snowden began experiencing intense dizziness and, eventually, his first epileptic seizure. Following a series of seizures, Snowden took a short-term disability leave from Dell. The final chapter of Part Two, \"On the Couch\", describes his time spent recovering on his mother's blue couch as well his thoughts on authoritarian states and privacy in the context of the 2011 [[Arab Spring]].\n\n=== Part Three ===\nIn March 2012, he began working at \"[[Kunia Regional SIGINT Operations Center|the Tunnel]]\", a former aircraft factory turned NSA facility located under a pineapple field in [[Kunia Camp, Hawaii|Kunia]], on the island of [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]]. He was working on a Dell contract for the NSA. Snowden moved to Hawaii for the more relaxed lifestyle and the less stressful duties of his new position, in an effort to lessen the triggers of his seizures. He was the sole employee of the Office of Information Sharing, where he worked as a [[SharePoint]] systems administrator. He began actively searching for the NSA's surveillance capabilities and abuses at this time. As part of his work, Snowden developed a system called Heartbeat which created an automated queue from the classified documents posted to the Intelligence Community's \"readboards\". Heartbeat would perpetually scan for new and unique documents and create a kind of [[News aggregator|aggregated newsfeed]] personalized for each employee, based on their interests and their security clearance. Heartbeat was highly comprehensive, accessing beyond the NSA's network into the networks of the CIA and the FBI as well as into the Department of Defense\u2019s top-secret [[Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System]]. Heartbeat's servers stored a copy of each scanned document, allowing Snowden to \"perform the kind of deep interagency searches that the heads of most agencies could only dream of.\" Snowden says that nearly all of the documents that he later leaked to journalists were received through Heartbeat.\n\n[[File:Edward Snowden's former house in Waipahu, Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Edward Snowden's former house in [[Waipahu, Hawaii]].]]\n\nIn \"Whistleblowing\", Snowden discusses the [[Constitution of the United States]] and argues that the Intelligence Community have \"hacked\" it by acting with impunity from the executive branch, the legislative branch, and the judiciary branch. He also discusses the history of whistleblowing and argues that the terms \"leaking\" and \"whistleblowing\" should not be used interchangeably because he believes \"leaking\" is done out of self-interest, not out of public interest.\n\nWhen Snowden decided to go public, he realized he would have to have documentation or he risked being doubted. He chose not to self-publish to avoid being \"lost among the crazy\" of people posting classified secrets to the Internet every day. He avoided [[WikiLeaks]] because he felt their new strategy of publishing leaks as they received them would be no different to him self-publishing. He felt a [[document dump]] was not appropriate as his leaks were too \"tangled and technical\". He considered ''[[The New York Times]]'' but was unimpressed with how [[Bill Keller]] intentionally delayed the reporting of the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]] until after George W. Bush's 2004 reelection. He chose a number of journalists to contact, primarily messaging documentarian [[Laura Poitras]] and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]]. He communicated with them over e-mail under the aliases \"Cincinnatus\", \"Citizenfour\" and \"Verax\". To stay anonymous, he went [[war-driving]], exploiting local Wi-Fi networks with an antenna and magnetic GPS sensor while driving in his car around Oahu. He used [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] and the Kismet mapping software, running on the [[Tails (operating system)|Tails]] operating system which allowed him to easily [[MAC spoofing|spoof]] his laptop's [[MAC address]].\n\nUnder the guise of compatibility testing, Snowden transferred documents from the Heartbeat server to outdated desktop Dell PCs from his office, then onto [[SD card]]s after [[Data_deduplication|deduplicating]], [[Data_compression|compressing]] and [[Encryption_software|encrypting]] them. He carried the SD cards out through security, hiding them inside a [[Rubik's Cube]], in his sock, in his cheek, and in his pocket. At home, he transferred them onto a single external drive which he left out in the open on his desk.\n\nHe left Dell on March 15, 2013 and began working as an \"infrastructure analyst\" at the National Threat Operations Center (NTOC) in Honolulu through a contractor job at [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The NTOC had access to [[XKEYSCORE]]. Snowden witnessed coworkers use XKEYSCORE to view information about their current and former lovers,  called [[LOVEINT]]. He also recalls one time that affected him, watching a personal video of a father and his young son. Between March\u2013May 2013, Snowden began rapidly preparing to leave the country, emptying his bank accounts and erasing and encrypting his old computers. He researched his safest and most conducive destination, narrowing it down to [[Hong Kong]]. The day after Lindsay left on a camping trip, Snowden took an emergency medical leave of absence from work, citing epilepsy. He brought four laptops with him: one for secure communications, one for normal communications, a decoy, and [[Air gap (networking)|a laptop that had never connected to any networks and would never be used to do so]]. He flew to Tokyo then to Hong Kong on May 20, 2013, paying in cash both times.\n\nHe stayed in the [[The Mira Hong Kong]] hotel, where Glenn and Laura met him on June 2, 2013. Between June 3\u2013June 9 in Snowden's hotel room, Glenn and his ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' colleague [[Ewen MacAskill]] interviewed Snowden, with Laura filming what would later feature in her Academy Award-winning documentary ''[[Citizenfour]]'' (2014). On June 5, ''The Guardian'' published Glenn's first story, on the [[United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court|FISA court]] warrant that ordered [[Verizon Business Network Services|Verizon]] to provide a daily feed to the NSA containing \"telephony metadata\". On June 6, ''The Guardian'' published Glenn's revelation of [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' published Laura and [[Barton Gellman]]'s story on PRISM on June 7. Snowden's identity was revealed on June 9 through a video interview directed by Laura published on ''The Guardian''{{'}}s website. The U.S. government charged Snowden under the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] on June 14 and formally requested his extradition on June 21, Snowden's 30th birthday.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align             = right\n | total_width       = 280\n | image1            = Laura Poitras 2014.jpg\n | image2            = Glenn Greenwald 2014-01-20 001.jpg\n | footer            = [[Laura Poitras]] (left) and [[Glenn Greenwald]] (right) were both contacted by Edward Snowden anonymously over encrypted email.\n}}\n\nAccompanied by [[Sarah Harrison (journalist)|Sarah Harrison]] of [[WikiLeaks]], Snowden attempted to travel to [[Ecuador]] for political asylum. They planned to fly to Moscow, then to Havana, then to Caracas, then to [[Quito, Ecuador]] because they were unable to fly directly from Hong Kong and all of the other connecting flights traveled through United States airspace. They arrived at Moscow's [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] on June 23, but were taken aside and questioned by a man from Russia's [[Federal Security Service]] (FSB). The man asked Snowden to work for them, but Snowden rejected the offer and said he had no intention to stay in Russia. The man was surprised and informed Snowden that the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] had canceled his passport. He proceeded to ask Snowden to share information with them but he refused. Snowden was detained in Sheremetyevo for forty days, during which he applied to twenty-seven countries for political asylum but none offered. On August 1, the Russian government granted Snowden temporary asylum.\n\nThe book's penultimate 28th chapter is composed of entries from Lindsay Mills' 2013 diary. Snowden explained that no one but her had the experience or the right to recount that period of her life: \"the FBI interrogations, the surveillance, the press attention, the online harassment, the confusion and pain, the anger and sadness.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Edward Snowden|title=Permanent Record|date=September 17, 2019|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-250-23724-8}}</ref>\n\nIn the final chapter, \"Love and Exile\", Snowden expresses his feelings on the impact of his revelations, including ''[[ACLU v. Clapper]]'' and the EU's [[General Data Protection Regulation]], and his hopes for the future of technology and privacy. He also discusses adjusting to life in Moscow with Lindsay. In the chapter's final sentence, Snowden reveals he and Lindsay were married in 2017.\n\n== Civil lawsuit ==\nOn September 17, 2019, the [[Federal Government of the United States]] filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] against Snowden for alleged violations of non-disclosure agreements with the CIA and NSA.<ref name=\"civilcharges20190917\">{{cite news |url=https://www.justice.gov/usao-edva/pr/united-states-files-civil-lawsuit-against-edward-snowden |title=United States Files Civil Lawsuit Against Edward Snowden |date=September 17, 2019 |accessdate=September 17, 2019 |first1=Joshua |last1=Stueve |work=Department of Justice, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Eastern District of Virginia}}</ref> The complaint alleges that Snowden violated prepublication obligations related to the publication of his memoir ''Permanent Record''.

The Chinese version removed Snowden's observation on the motivations of Arab Spring protestors: \"The crowds were calling for an end to oppression, censorship, and precarity. They were declaring that in a truly just society, the people were not answerable to the government, the government was answerable to the people.\" The following section, in which Snowden comments on the nature of authoritarian states, was also largely censored. In the section, Snowden writes, \"Authoritarian states are typically not governments of laws, but governments of leaders, who demand loyalty from their subjects and are hostile to dissent.\" The Chinese version also censored Snowden's references to the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor anonymity network]], China's military cyber intelligence and its capabilities, China's [[Great Firewall]], as well Snowden's characterization of [[Hong Kong]] as having \"nominal autonomy\". The Chinese version censored topics not directly related to China as well, including Snowden's commentary on the [[right to privacy]].

One day, he encounters a series of mysterious flyers on his route to work. Intrigued, he decides to take a tag and calls the number, after which he's invited to the Jejune Institute for an induction ceremony. After arriving, Peter receives a warning about Jejune's insidious motives and flees the building. Following instructions from the so-named Commander 14 of the Elsewhere Society, Peter escapes the Institute and is sent an address. The information leads Peter to a shop in an alley where he meets Simone, and the two work together to find clues and solve the Society's puzzles. The experience improves Peter's outlook on life, but the feeling quickly fades away, only returning after receiving another Elsewhere Society mission.\n\nPeter's next task leads him to a gathering of other participants in the Society's games. Those present are assigned groups of four, where Peter is reunited with Simone and meets Fredwynn and Janice. The group is told to find Clara, Keeper of \"Divine Nonchalance\". They go to a diner to discuss the nature of the game, with Janice believing the game is a prank, Simone guessing it's a marketing stunt, and Fredwynn insisting that the whole thing is a high-level conspiracy. When pressed, Peter suggests that the game is real. Noticing the time, Simone leaves the diner but is accosted by two men outside.

They follow the car to a theater, but Fredwynn is nowhere to be seen. Octavio finds them and takes them to the stage, where Janice is persuaded to join the audience of the shareholders' meeting. Janice volunteers to demonstrate \"The I.D.E.A\", an invention apparently created by Clara before her disappearance. The device takes Janice back to the day of her wedding, showing her a version of her younger self expressing disdain for Janice's lack of independence.

The Society worked to improve Fishtown and make it beautiful, garnering the attention of the Jejune Institute. The next day, Janice finds out Fredwynn hid urgent messages from her husband's nurse. Peter quits his job after being inspired by Clara's passion.

He and Fredwynn infiltrate his old office and identify an IP address through a playlist containing the songs they've heard on their missions. Meanwhile, Janice and Simone find an apartment with one of Clara's paintings and discover her full name on a lease from 1999, Clara Torres. Through newspaper records, they trace Clara's steps back to a former psychiatric hospital Janice had been admitted to in her past, now an apartment complex. Fredwynn and Peter meet them there, revealing the IP address location as the penthouse, and the four of them head up in the elevator.

Commander 14 shows his real face, identical in appearance to Octavio, and they give everyone a new task: to work together. The group watches a video montage of their sleuthing from earlier that day, and realize that it was still just part of the game. Clara, Octavio, and Commander 14 reveal themselves as actors, devastating Peter. All the participants head over to the game's afterparty.

There, the four discover a cassette tape in which Clara describes her dream of creating art that changes people's view of the world, the message which first inspired Lee to create the game.  Peter and Simone attempt a first date, but Simone refuses to continue a romantic relationship, insistent that Peter's na\u00efvet\u00e9 would make it impossible for them in the real world. Meanwhile, Janice finds out Lev suffered a second stroke. Fredwynn stays with her at the hospital as she decides to take him off life support. Peter, Simone, and Fredwynn attend the funeral service, where Fredwynn gives the others their personal files from the game.

The others quickly get irritated by his suspicions and tell him to go home and wait for the next clue. Unable to sleep, he re-thinks his steps from the previous day and goes to ask Janice for help retrieving a clue from the wedding video. They enter her \"memory palace\" and decipher a hidden address.

The writing recounts Clara's life in Fishtown and the early days of the Elsewhere Society, originally made up of Clara and three friends. The Society worked to improve Fishtown and make it beautiful, garnering the attention of the Jejune Institute. The next day, Janice finds out Fredwynn hid urgent messages from her husband's nurse. Peter quits his job after being inspired by Clara's passion. Back at the house, the group resumes the story of Clara as she's being recruited by Octavio, who promised her vast resources and the power to change the world. She rejected Jejune's offer but disappeared soon after. After finishing the story, Simone shows Peter a 20 year-old photo of Clara's first mural, evidence that Clara and the events described in the game are real.\n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 6\n |Title = Everyone\n |DirectedBy = [[Ariel Kleiman]]\n |WrittenBy = Eva Anderson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|3|30}}\n |Viewers = 0.228<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-30-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.30.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=March 31, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = At the diner, the group receives messages informing them \"the truth\" will be revealed that night. Believing this to be the end of the game, they agree to split into teams to find out all they can before it's over. Peter volunteers to help Fredwynn uncover his conspiracy, leaving Janice and Simone to look for clues about Clara on his behalf. Peter realizes his former employer's parent company is involved in the game. He and Fredwynn infiltrate his old office and identify an IP address through a playlist containing the songs they've heard on their missions. Meanwhile, Janice and Simone find an apartment with one of Clara's paintings and discover her full name on a lease from 1999, Clara Torres. Through newspaper records, they trace Clara's steps back to a former psychiatric hospital Janice had been admitted to in her past, now an apartment complex. Fredwynn and Peter meet them there, revealing the IP address location as the penthouse, and the four of them head up in the elevator. Inside the penthouse they find what looks to be a crime scene and a TV repeating messages from Octavio and Commander 14 both claiming the other has Clara.\n |LineColor = 4AD5E9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |Title = Cave of Kelpius\n |DirectedBy = Marta Cunningham\n |WrittenBy = Ashley Lyle & Bart Nickerson\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|6}}\n |Viewers = 0.292<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-monday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-6-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Monday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.6.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=April 7, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = A man drinking chocolate milk arrives at the penthouse, but flees after seeing the group.

Each group starts demanding the other side hand over Clara, when suddenly, Octavio and Commander 14 both appear. Commander 14 shows his real face, identical in appearance to Octavio, and they give everyone a new task: to work together. The group watches a video montage of their sleuthing from earlier that day, and realize that it was still just part of the game. Clara, Octavio, and Commander 14 reveal themselves as actors, devastating Peter. All the participants head over to the game's afterparty. Fredwynn searches for the architect of the game, while Simone and Peter agree to start a relationship. Feeling left out, Janice leaves the party and recognizes a woman as the architect.

There, the four discover a cassette tape in which Clara describes her dream of creating art that changes people's view of the world, the message which first inspired Lee to create the game.  Peter and Simone go on a first date, but Simone refuses to continue a romantic relationship, insistent that Peter's na\u00efvet\u00e9 would make it impossible for them in the real world. Meanwhile, Janice finds out that her husband Lev suffered a second stroke. Fredwynn stays with her at the hospital as she decides to take Lev off life support. Peter, Simone, and Fredwynn attend the funeral service, where Fredwynn gives the others their personal files from the game.

There is only one reason: she is listed in the ''Guinness Book of World Records'' as having the highest IQ ever recorded. Never mind that this record is based on a non-standardized test put out by an obscure group known as Mega, supposedly the world's most selective organization of geniuses. Ignore the fact that test scores at the extreme ends of any distribution are notoriously unreliable. . . . None of this is meant to downplay her very real accomplishments; by all accounts, vos Savant is a sensible and grounded woman, and she has won several awards for her work in the fields of education and communications. But her fame came, in the words of journalist Julie Baumgold, 'only because of the glory of that number.'

She took the 1937 Stanford-Binet, Second Revision test at age ten.<ref name=baumgold/> She claims her first test was in September 1956 and measured her mental age at 22 years and 10 months, yielding a 228 score.<ref name=baumgold/> This figure was listed in the ''Guinness Book of World Records''; it is also listed in her books' biographical sections and was given by her in interviews.\n\n[[Alan S. Kaufman]], a psychology professor and author of IQ tests, writes in ''IQ Testing 101'' that \"Miss Savant was given an old version of the Stanford-Binet (Terman & Merrill 1937), which did, indeed, use the antiquated formula of MA/CA \u00d7 100. But in the test manual's norms, the Binet does not permit IQs to rise above 170 at any age, child or adult. As the authors of the old Binet stated: 'Beyond fifteen the mental ages are entirely artificial and are to be thought of as simply numerical scores.' (Terman & Merrill 1937). ...the psychologist who came up with an IQ of 228 committed an extrapolation of a misconception, thereby violating almost every rule imaginable concerning the meaning of IQs.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=IQ Testing 101 |last=Kaufman |first=Alan S. |authorlink=Alan S.

''Parade'' continued to get questions, so \"Ask Marilyn\" was made.\n\nShe uses her column to answer questions on many chiefly academic subjects; solve logical, mathematical or vocabulary puzzles posed by readers; answer requests for advice with logic; and give self-devised quizzes and puzzles. Aside from the weekly printed column, \"Ask Marilyn\" is a daily online column that adds to the printed version by resolving controversial answers, correcting mistakes, expanding answers, reposting previous answers, and solving additional questions.\n\nThree of her books (''Ask Marilyn'', ''More Marilyn'', and ''Of Course, I'm for Monogamy'') are compilations of questions and answers from \"Ask Marilyn\". ''The Power of Logical Thinking'' includes many questions and answers from the column.\n\n==Famous columns==\n\n===The Monty Hall problem===\n{{Main|Monty Hall problem}}\nSavant was asked the following question in her September 9, 1990 column:<ref name=\"Original question\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marilynvossavant.com/articles/gameshow.html|title=Game Show Problem|last=vos Savant|first=Marilyn|publisher=marilynvossavant.com|accessdate=2010-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310140547/http://www.marilynvossavant.com/articles/gameshow.html|archive-date=2010-03-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{quote|Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say #1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say #3, which has a goat. He says to you, \"Do you want to pick door #2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?}}\n\nThis question is called the [[Monty Hall problem]] due to its resembling scenarios on the game show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]];'' its answer existed before it was used in \"Ask Marilyn\". She said the selection should be switched to door #2 because it has a {{frac|2|3}} chance of success, while door #1 has just {{frac|1|3}}. To summarize, {{frac|2|3}} of the time the opened door #3 will indicate the location of the door with the car (the door you had not picked and the one not opened by the host). Only {{frac|1|3}} of the time will the opened door #3 mislead you into changing from the winning door to a losing door. These probabilities assume you change your choice each time door #3 is opened, and that the host always opens a door with a goat. This response provoked letters from thousands of readers, nearly all arguing doors #1 and #2 each have an equal chance of success.

If the puppies are labeled (A and B), each has a 50% chance of being male independently. This independence is restricted when at least A or B is male. Now, if A is ''not'' male, B ''must'' be male, and vice versa.

In the original column, published on December 25, 2011, a reader asked:\n\n{{quote|I manage a drug-testing program for an organization with 400 employees. Every three months, a random-number generator selects 100 names for testing. Afterward, these names go back into the selection pool. Obviously, the probability of an employee being chosen in one quarter is 25 percent. But what is the likelihood of being chosen over the course of a year?}}\n\nHer response was:\n\n{{quote|The probability remains 25 percent, despite the repeated testing. One might think that as the number of tests grows, the likelihood of being chosen increases, but as long as the size of the pool remains the same, so does the probability. Goes against your intuition, doesn't it?}}\n\nThe correctness of the answer depends on how the question is asked. The probability of being chosen each time is 25% but probability of being chosen at least once across the 4 events is higher. In this case, the correct answer is around 68%, calculated as the complement of the probability of not being chosen in any of the four quarters: 1 \u2013 (0.75<sup>4</sup>).<ref>[http://www.parade.com/askmarilyn/2012/01/22-sunday-column.html Ask Marilyn: Did Marilyn Make a Mistake on Drug Testing?].

The question was: \"If two people could complete a project in six hours, how long would it take each of them to do identical projects on their own, given that one took four hours longer than the other?\" Her answer was 10 hours and 14 hours, reasoning that if together it took them 6 hours to complete a project, then the total effort was 12 \"man hours\". If they then each do a separate full project, the total effort needed would be 24 hours, so the answer (10+14) needed to add up to 24 with a difference of 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marilynvossavant.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1975|title=Marilyn vos Savant \u2022 View topic \u2013 Unequal Work|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref> Savant later issued a correction, as the answer ignored the fact that the two people get different amounts of work done per hour: if they are working jointly on a project, they can maximize their combined productivity, but if they split the work in half, one person will finish sooner and cannot fully contribute. This subtlety causes the problem to require solving a quadratic equation and thus to not have a [[rational number|rational]] solution. Instead, the answer is <math alt=\"four plus square root of forty\">4 + \\sqrt{40}</math> (approximately 10.32) and <math alt=\"eight plus square root of forty\">8 + \\sqrt{40}</math> (approximately 14.32) hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parade.condenast.com/315872/marilynvossavant/the-correct-solution-to-the-brad-and-angelina-math-problem-2/|title=The Correct Solution to the Brad-and-Angelina Math Problem|author=Marilyn vos Savant|work=Parade|accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Fermat's Last Theorem==\nA few months after [[Andrew Wiles]] said he had proved [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], Savant published ''The World's Most Famous Math Problem'' (October 1993),<ref>Fermat's Last Theorem and Wiles' proof were discussed in her ''Parade'' column of November 21, 1993, which introduced the book.</ref> which surveys the history of Fermat's last theorem as well as other mathematical problems. Controversy came from its criticism of Wiles' proof; critics questioned whether it was based on a correct understanding of [[mathematical induction]], [[proof by contradiction]], and [[imaginary numbers]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Boston | first=Nigel | last2=Granville|first2= Andrew | title=Review of The World's Most Famous Math Problem | journal=American Mathematical Monthly | volume=102 | issue=5 | pages=470\u2013473 | doi= 10.2307/2975048|date=May 1995 | url=http://www.dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/PDF/VS.pdf | format=.PDF | accessdate=2008-02-25 | jstor=2975048 | publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 102, No. 5}}</ref>\n\nEspecially contested was Savants' statement that Wiles' proof should be rejected for its use of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. Savant stated that because \"the chain of proof is based in [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic (Lobachevskian) geometry]]\", and because [[squaring the circle]] is seen as a \"famous impossibility\" despite being possible in hyperbolic geometry, then \"if we reject a hyperbolic method of squaring the circle, we should also reject a hyperbolic proof of Fermat's last theorem.\"\n\nSpecialists flagged discrepancies between the two cases, distinguishing the use of hyperbolic geometry as a \"tool\" for proving Fermat's last theorem and from its use as a \"setting\" for squaring the circle: squaring the circle in hyperbolic geometry is a different problem from that of squaring it in Euclidean geometry. Savant was criticized for rejecting hyperbolic geometry as a satisfactory basis for Wiles' proof, with critics pointing out that [[axiomatic set theory]] (rather than Euclidean geometry) is now the accepted foundation of mathematical proofs and that set theory is sufficiently robust to encompass both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry as well as geometry and adding numbers.\n\nSavant retracted the argument in a July 1995 addendum, saying she saw the theorem as \"an intellectual challenge{{spaced ndash}}'to find another proof using only tools available to Fermat in the 17th century.{{'\"}}\n\nThe book came with a glowing introduction by [[Martin Gardner]] whose reputation as a mathematics populariser may have boosted the book's notoriety.\n\n==Publications==\n* 1985 \u2013 ''Omni I.Q.

''The Power of Logical Thinking'' includes many questions and answers from the column.\n\n==Famous columns==\n\n===The Monty Hall problem===\n{{Main|Monty Hall problem}}\nSavant was asked the following question in her September 9, 1990 column:<ref name=\"Original question\">{{cite web|url=http://www.marilynvossavant.com/articles/gameshow.html|title=Game Show Problem|last=vos Savant|first=Marilyn|publisher=marilynvossavant.com|accessdate=2010-08-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310140547/http://www.marilynvossavant.com/articles/gameshow.html|archive-date=2010-03-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{quote|Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors. Behind one door is a car, behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say #1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say #3, which has a goat. He says to you, \"Do you want to pick door #2?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice of doors?}}\n\nThis question is called the [[Monty Hall problem]] due to its resembling scenarios on the game show ''[[Let's Make a Deal]];'' its answer existed before it was used in \"Ask Marilyn\". She said the selection should be switched to door #2 because it has a {{frac|2|3}} chance of success, while door #1 has just {{frac|1|3}}. To summarize, {{frac|2|3}} of the time the opened door #3 will indicate the location of the door with the car (the door you had not picked and the one not opened by the host). Only {{frac|1|3}} of the time will the opened door #3 mislead you into changing from the winning door to a losing door. These probabilities assume you change your choice each time door #3 is opened, and that the host always opens a door with a goat. This response provoked letters from thousands of readers, nearly all arguing doors #1 and #2 each have an equal chance of success. A follow-up column reaffirming her position served only to intensify the debate and soon became a feature article on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]''. ''Parade'' received around 10,000 letters from readers who thought that her workings were incorrect.<ref>{{cite news | last=Tierney|first= John |authorlink=John Tierney (journalist)| title=Behind Monty Hall's Doors: Puzzle, Debate and Answer? | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEFDD1E3FF932A15754C0A967958260 | work=The New York Times | date=21 July 1991 | accessdate=2008-08-07}}</ref>\n\nUnder the \"standard\" version of the problem, the host always opens a losing door and offers a switch. In the standard version, Savant's answer is correct. However, the statement of the problem as posed in her column is ambiguous.<ref>Krauss, Stefan and Wang, X. T. (2003). \"The Psychology of the Monty Hall Problem: Discovering Psychological Mechanisms for Solving a Tenacious Brain Teaser\", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology: General'' '''132'''(1).

If  the host operates under a strategy of only offering a switch if the initial guess is correct, it would clearly be disadvantageous to accept the offer. If the host merely selects a door at random, the question is likewise very different from the standard version. Savant addressed these issues by writing the following in ''Parade'' magazine, \"the original answer defines certain conditions, the most significant of which is that the host always opens a losing door on purpose. Anything else is a different question.\"<ref>{{cite news | title=Game Show Problem | url=http://www.marilynvossavant.com/articles/gameshow.html | work=marilynvossavant.com | accessdate=2008-06-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310140547/http://www.marilynvossavant.com/articles/gameshow.html | archive-date=2010-03-10 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nShe expounded on her reasoning in a second follow-up and called on school teachers to show the problem to classes. In her final column on the problem, she gave the results of more than 1,000 school experiments.

What is the probability that the ''other'' one is a male?}}\n\nWhen Savant replied \"one out of three\", readers<ref>{{cite book|title=The Power of Logical Thinking|author=vos Savant, Marilyn|year=1996|location=New York|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9780312156275|oclc=255578248|pages=[https://archive.org/details/poweroflogicalth00voss/page/19 19]\u201321|url=https://archive.org/details/poweroflogicalth00voss|url-access=registration|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref> wrote the odds were 50\u201350. In a follow-up, she defended her answer, saying that \"If we could shake a pair of puppies out of a cup the way we do dice, there are four ways they could land\", in three of which at least one is male, but in only one of which none are male.\n\nThe confusion arises here because the bather is not asked if the puppy he is holding is a male, but rather if either is a male. If the puppies are labeled (A and B), each has a 50% chance of being male independently. This independence is restricted when at least A or B is male. Now, if A is ''not'' male, B ''must'' be male, and vice versa. This restriction is introduced by the way the question is structured and is easily overlooked{{spaced ndash}}misleading people to the erroneous answer of 50%. See [[Boy or Girl paradox]] for solution details.\n\nThe problem re-emerged in 1996\u201397 with two cases juxtaposed:\n\n{{quote|Say that a woman and a man (who are unrelated) each have two children.

My algebra teacher insists that the probability is greater that the man has two boys, but I think the chances may be the same. What do you think?}}\n\nSavant agreed with the teacher, saying the chances were only 1 out of 3 that the woman had two boys, but 1 out of 2 the man had two boys. Readers argued for 1 out of 2 in both cases, prompting follow-ups. Finally she began a survey, asking female readers with exactly two children, at least one of them male, to give the sex of both children. Of the 17,946 women who responded, 35.9%, about 1 in 3, had two boys.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Human Biology (journal)|Human Biology]] |title=The Most Widely Publicized Gender Problem in Human Genetics |last1=Stansfield |first1=William D. |last2=Carlton |first2=Matthew A. |date=February 2009 |volume=81 |issue=1 |url=http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/humbiol/vol81/iss1/1/ |accessdate=2013-04-07 |quote=Some readers doubted her 1/3 solution, so she asked for data from her women readers \"with two children (no more), at least one of which is a boy (either child or both of them).\" She got 17,946 responses by letters and e-mails.

In the original column, published on December 25, 2011, a reader asked:\n\n{{quote|I manage a drug-testing program for an organization with 400 employees. Every three months, a random-number generator selects 100 names for testing. Afterward, these names go back into the selection pool. Obviously, the probability of an employee being chosen in one quarter is 25 percent. But what is the likelihood of being chosen over the course of a year?}}\n\nHer response was:\n\n{{quote|The probability remains 25 percent, despite the repeated testing. One might think that as the number of tests grows, the likelihood of being chosen increases, but as long as the size of the pool remains the same, so does the probability. Goes against your intuition, doesn't it?}}\n\nThe correctness of the answer depends on how the question is asked. The probability of being chosen each time is 25% but probability of being chosen at least once across the 4 events is higher. In this case, the correct answer is around 68%, calculated as the complement of the probability of not being chosen in any of the four quarters: 1 \u2013 (0.75<sup>4</sup>).<ref>[http://www.parade.com/askmarilyn/2012/01/22-sunday-column.html Ask Marilyn: Did Marilyn Make a Mistake on Drug Testing?]. ''Parade'', 22 January 2012. Retrieved 24 January 2012.</ref>\n\nOn June 22, 2014, Savant made an error in a word problem.  The question was: \"If two people could complete a project in six hours, how long would it take each of them to do identical projects on their own, given that one took four hours longer than the other?\" Her answer was 10 hours and 14 hours, reasoning that if together it took them 6 hours to complete a project, then the total effort was 12 \"man hours\". If they then each do a separate full project, the total effort needed would be 24 hours, so the answer (10+14) needed to add up to 24 with a difference of 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marilynvossavant.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=1975|title=Marilyn vos Savant \u2022 View topic \u2013 Unequal Work|publisher=|accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref> Savant later issued a correction, as the answer ignored the fact that the two people get different amounts of work done per hour: if they are working jointly on a project, they can maximize their combined productivity, but if they split the work in half, one person will finish sooner and cannot fully contribute. This subtlety causes the problem to require solving a quadratic equation and thus to not have a [[rational number|rational]] solution. Instead, the answer is <math alt=\"four plus square root of forty\">4 + \\sqrt{40}</math> (approximately 10.32) and <math alt=\"eight plus square root of forty\">8 + \\sqrt{40}</math> (approximately 14.32) hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parade.condenast.com/315872/marilynvossavant/the-correct-solution-to-the-brad-and-angelina-math-problem-2/|title=The Correct Solution to the Brad-and-Angelina Math Problem|author=Marilyn vos Savant|work=Parade|accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Fermat's Last Theorem==\nA few months after [[Andrew Wiles]] said he had proved [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], Savant published ''The World's Most Famous Math Problem'' (October 1993),<ref>Fermat's Last Theorem and Wiles' proof were discussed in her ''Parade'' column of November 21, 1993, which introduced the book.</ref> which surveys the history of Fermat's last theorem as well as other mathematical problems. Controversy came from its criticism of Wiles' proof; critics questioned whether it was based on a correct understanding of [[mathematical induction]], [[proof by contradiction]], and [[imaginary numbers]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Boston | first=Nigel | last2=Granville|first2= Andrew | title=Review of The World's Most Famous Math Problem | journal=American Mathematical Monthly | volume=102 | issue=5 | pages=470\u2013473 | doi= 10.2307/2975048|date=May 1995 | url=http://www.dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/PDF/VS.pdf | format=.PDF | accessdate=2008-02-25 | jstor=2975048 | publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 102, No. 5}}</ref>\n\nEspecially contested was Savants' statement that Wiles' proof should be rejected for its use of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. Savant stated that because \"the chain of proof is based in [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic (Lobachevskian) geometry]]\", and because [[squaring the circle]] is seen as a \"famous impossibility\" despite being possible in hyperbolic geometry, then \"if we reject a hyperbolic method of squaring the circle, we should also reject a hyperbolic proof of Fermat's last theorem.\"\n\nSpecialists flagged discrepancies between the two cases, distinguishing the use of hyperbolic geometry as a \"tool\" for proving Fermat's last theorem and from its use as a \"setting\" for squaring the circle: squaring the circle in hyperbolic geometry is a different problem from that of squaring it in Euclidean geometry. Savant was criticized for rejecting hyperbolic geometry as a satisfactory basis for Wiles' proof, with critics pointing out that [[axiomatic set theory]] (rather than Euclidean geometry) is now the accepted foundation of mathematical proofs and that set theory is sufficiently robust to encompass both Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry as well as geometry and adding numbers.\n\nSavant retracted the argument in a July 1995 addendum, saying she saw the theorem as \"an intellectual challenge{{spaced ndash}}'to find another proof using only tools available to Fermat in the 17th century.{{'\"}}\n\nThe book came with a glowing introduction by [[Martin Gardner]] whose reputation as a mathematics populariser may have boosted the book's notoriety.\n\n==Publications==\n* 1985 \u2013 ''Omni I.Q.

He was a cricketer but also a gambler who killed himself in the face of financial ruin.\n\n==Early life==\nBromley was the only son of [[John Bromley (the younger)|John Bromley]] {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MP}}, and his wife Mercy Bromley, the daughter and eventual sole heir of [[William Bromley (of Holt Castle)|William Bromley]] {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MP}} (1656\u20131707). His mother died in childbirth and his father died in 1718. <ref name=\"Collins\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=HVY5AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA247 Brydges, Sir Egerton.

She died in childbed after the birth of their only son, and was buried in [[St Margaret's, Westminster]].<ref name = Collins/>\n\n==Career==\nAt the [[1727 British general election|1727]] Bromley was elected in a contest as Whig [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Cambridgeshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridgeshire]] with Samuel Shepheard, but was defeated at [[Cambridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge]] where he also stood. He was  [[Lord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire]] between 1729 and 1742 and became the chief Whig election manager in Cambridgeshire. His first reported speech, said to be \u2018well worded\u2019 and \u2018studied\u2019 was made on 27 February 1730 in the Dunkirk debate, when he was put up by Walpole to sidetrack an opposition motion. In 1731, he was one of the Members ordered by the House to draw up a bill for encouraging the sugar colonies, presumably because of his West Indian interests, and this was the basis of the 1733 Molasses Act. He spoke on the Address in 1732 and moved the address on the Princess Royal's marriage in 1733 with another \u2018studied\u2019 speech. At the [[1734 British general election]], he was returned unopposed. He moved the Address in 1740, and in 1741 warmly opposed the proposal that Walpole should leave the House while the motion for his dismissal was being debated. He was considered a \u2018useful speaker for the Court\u2019. After he was raised to the House of Lords he carried on managing the Cambridgeshire elections, and is said to have spent \u00a3100,000 out of his own pocket in supporting the government interest in the county and the Cambridge corporation.<ref name = HOP>{{cite web| url =http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1715-1754/member/bromley-henry-1705-55 | title= BROMLEY, Henry (1705-55), of Horseheath Hall, Cambs.| publisher= History of Parliament Online| accessdate = 2 January 2019 }}</ref> In May 1741 he was raised to the peerage as '''Lord Montfort''', Baron of Horseheath, in the County of Cambridge.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=8011 |date=2 May 1741 |page=1 }}</ref>\n  \n==Cricket==\nMontfort was active in [[cricket]], both as a player (for [[London Cricket Club]]) and as a [[patronage|patron]].
