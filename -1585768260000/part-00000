S. Amudhan]] in his directorial debut. The film stars [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] and [[Disha Pandey]] in the lead roles. Thamizh Padam was the first full length spoof in Tamil cinema. It parodies contemporary commercial films and actors in [[Tamil cinema]], mocking the [[Stereotype#Role in art and culture|stereotypical]] scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videos.behindwoods.com/videos-q1-09/movie-trailer/tamil-padam-shiva.html |title=Tamil Padam&nbsp;\u2014 Tamil Movie Trailer&nbsp;\u2014 Tamil Padam &#124; Shiva &#124; Cloud Nine Movies &#124; Dayanidhi Alagiri&nbsp;\u2014 Behindwoods.com |publisher=Videos.behindwoods.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/49309.html |title=A 'Tamil Padam' on Tamil films&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref>\n\nThe film was distributed by [[Dhayanidhi Alagiri]] under the banner [[Cloud Nine Movies]], and it was released on 29 January 2010. It won critical acclaim and commercial success at the box office. The film was later remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Sudigadu]]'' starring [[Allari Naresh]]. A sequel called ''[[Thamizh Padam 2]]'' has been confirmed and released in July 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the Indian village of Cinemapatti, [[Sex-selective abortion|male infanticide]] is predominant, and all male babies are required to be killed immediately after birth. One such baby is headed for such a fate, until he \"speaks\" to his caretaker-grandmother ([[Paravai Muniyamma]]) and asks to be sent to [[Chennai]] on a goods train, where he plans to grow into a hero. The old woman complies, and takes the baby, named Shiva, to Chennai and raises him herself, living in the city's poorer section.\n\nOn growing into manhood, Shiva ([[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]]) gains a reputation by giving a massive entry by beating up extortionists by throwing them in the air and saving a rape victim; soon he is glorified as a \"mass hero\".{{efn|In Tamil cinema, the term \"mass hero\" is a colloquialism referring to an immensely popular actor who can romance, sing, dance, amuse, and defeat several goons in a fight.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Man-of-masses/articleshow/3952708.cms Man of masses&nbsp;\u2013 Times of India].

He spends his time hanging out, [[Alcoholic beverage|drinking]] and playing [[carrom]] with his gang of friends, composed of Nakul ([[M. S. Bhaskar]]), Bharath ([[Venniradai Moorthy]]) and Siddharth ([[Manobala]]).\n\nShiva runs into a headstrong girl named Priya ([[Disha Pandey]]) whom he falls in love with. After learning of her hatred for men, he realises that she has dedicated her life to classical dance, learns [[Bharatanatyam]] over the course of a night, and performs an exaggerated dance sequence for her. She reciprocates his feelings, and the two start a relationship. Shiva is then challenged by Priya's rich and powerful father Kodeeswaran, who refuses to give his daughter to a poor man. Shiva swears to become a billionaire, and promptly does so, during the course of a 2:50 minute song.\n\nKodeeswaran accepts Shiva as a suitor, and fixes his engagement to Priya. During the ceremony, Shiva hears a passing comment that he does not know his own father. Offended, he travels to Cinemapatti, accompanied by Bharath, to learn his roots. After encountering a host of Tamil-cinema stereotypes of several decades ago, he succeeds in uniting with his family when a woman (revealed to be Shiva's father's concubine) leads him to his father, mother and sister. He finds them when they sing their \"family song\" (the [[Michael Learns to Rock]] number, \"[[Someday (Michael Learns to Rock song)|Someday]]\").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/regional/telugu/Thamizh-Padam-Movie-Review/articleshow/5517527.cms | title=Thamizh Padam Movie Review | work=The Times of India | date=30 January 2010 | accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unknown to anyone,Shiva has been targeting and killing several criminals in secret; he kills female gangster Swarna by making her slip over a banana peel; makes another big-time crook [[Death from laughter|laugh to death]]; tortures a drug dealer to commit suicide by continuous failed attempts on his life; and kills his final victim with the odour of his sock. The police discover that he is the killer, and it is revealed that Shiva is actually an undercover officer and was killing the criminals under direct orders from not only the Commissioner, but also from the [[President of the United States]].\n\nThe ganglord who commandeered the slain criminals, a mysterious person simply called \"D\", organises the kidnapping of Priya by telling pandia([[Sathish]]), and his henchmen to kidnap her and has Shiva beaten up. Shiva recovers, saves Priya by fighting off thugs using exaggerated stunts, and comes face to face with \"D\", revealed to be his grandmother. She explains that she did it to increase the fame of her grandson, and a heartbroken Shiva is forced to arrest her.\n\nAt the trial, Shiva accidentally kills an assassin who targets his grandmother, and is put on trial himself. He is saved, however, when a man who had helped him in Cinemapatti earlier testifies that Shiva was a victim of circumstance. Both Shiva and \"D\" are pardoned, and Shiva who has been promoted to [[Director General of Police|DGP]], unites happily with Priya, his family and friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] as Shiva\n* [[Disha Pandey]] as Priya\n* [[M.

It parodies contemporary commercial films and actors in [[Tamil cinema]], mocking the [[Stereotype#Role in art and culture|stereotypical]] scenes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videos.behindwoods.com/videos-q1-09/movie-trailer/tamil-padam-shiva.html |title=Tamil Padam&nbsp;\u2014 Tamil Movie Trailer&nbsp;\u2014 Tamil Padam &#124; Shiva &#124; Cloud Nine Movies &#124; Dayanidhi Alagiri&nbsp;\u2014 Behindwoods.com |publisher=Videos.behindwoods.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/49309.html |title=A 'Tamil Padam' on Tamil films&nbsp;\u2013 Tamil Movie News |publisher=IndiaGlitz |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=2012-08-05}}</ref>\n\nThe film was distributed by [[Dhayanidhi Alagiri]] under the banner [[Cloud Nine Movies]], and it was released on 29 January 2010. It won critical acclaim and commercial success at the box office. The film was later remade in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] as ''[[Sudigadu]]'' starring [[Allari Naresh]]. A sequel called ''[[Thamizh Padam 2]]'' has been confirmed and released in July 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the Indian village of Cinemapatti, [[Sex-selective abortion|male infanticide]] is predominant, and all male babies are required to be killed immediately after birth. One such baby is headed for such a fate, until he \"speaks\" to his caretaker-grandmother ([[Paravai Muniyamma]]) and asks to be sent to [[Chennai]] on a goods train, where he plans to grow into a hero. The old woman complies, and takes the baby, named Shiva, to Chennai and raises him herself, living in the city's poorer section.\n\nOn growing into manhood, Shiva ([[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]]) gains a reputation by giving a massive entry by beating up extortionists by throwing them in the air and saving a rape victim; soon he is glorified as a \"mass hero\".{{efn|In Tamil cinema, the term \"mass hero\" is a colloquialism referring to an immensely popular actor who can romance, sing, dance, amuse, and defeat several goons in a fight.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Man-of-masses/articleshow/3952708.cms Man of masses&nbsp;\u2013 Times of India].

He spends his time hanging out, [[drinking|Alcoholic beverage]] and playing [[carrom]] with his gang of friends, composed of Nakul ([[M. S. Bhaskar]]), Bharath ([[Venniradai Moorthy]]) and Siddharth ([[Manobala]]).\n\nShiva runs into a headstrong girl named Priya ([[Disha Pandey]]) whom he falls in love with. After learning of her hatred for men, he realises that she has dedicated her life to classical dance, learns [[Bharatanatyam]] over the course of a night, and performs an exaggerated dance sequence for her. She reciprocates his feelings, and the two start a relationship. Shiva is then challenged by Priya's rich and powerful father Kodeeswaran, who refuses to give his daughter to a poor man. Shiva swears to become a billionaire, and promptly does so, during the course of a 2:50 minute song.\n\nKodeeswaran accepts Shiva as a suitor, and fixes his engagement to Priya. During the ceremony, Shiva hears a passing comment that he does not know his own father. Offended, he travels to Cinemapatti, accompanied by Bharath, to learn his roots. After encountering a host of Tamil-cinema stereotypes of several decades ago, he succeeds in uniting with his family when a woman (revealed to be Shiva's father's concubine) leads him to his father, mother and sister. He finds them when they sing their \"family song\" (the [[Michael Learns to Rock]] number, \"[[Someday (Michael Learns to Rock song)|Someday]]\").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/regional/telugu/Thamizh-Padam-Movie-Review/articleshow/5517527.cms | title=Thamizh Padam Movie Review | work=The Times of India | date=30 January 2010 | accessdate=31 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nHowever, unknown to anyone,Shiva has been targeting and killing several criminals in secret; he kills female gangster Swarna by making her slip over a banana peel; makes another big-time crook [[Death from laughter|laugh to death]]; tortures a drug dealer to suicide by continuous failed attempts on his life; and kills his final victim with the odour of his sock. The police discover that he is the killer, and it is revealed that Shiva is actually an undercover officer and was killing the criminals under direct orders from not only the Commissioner, but also from the [[President of the United States]].\n\nThe ganglord who commandeered the slain criminals, a mysterious person simply called \"D\", organises the kidnapping of Priya by telling pandia([[Sathish]]), and his henchmen to kidnap her and has Shiva beaten up. Shiva recovers, saves Priya by fighting off thugs using exaggerated stunts, and comes face to face with \"D\", revealed to be his grandmother. She explains that she did it to increase the fame of her grandson, and a heartbroken Shiva is forced to arrest her.\n\nAt the trial, Shiva accidentally kills an assassin who targets his grandmother, and is put on trial himself. He is saved, however, when a man who had helped him in Cinemapatti earlier testifies that Shiva was a victim of circumstance. Both Shiva and \"D\" are pardoned, and Shiva who has been promoted to [[Director General of Police|DGP]], unites happily with Priya, his family and friends.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Shiva (actor)|Shiva]] as Shiva\n* [[Disha Pandey]] as Priya\n* [[M.

It was created by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. It has been featured as a [[minigame]] in all of the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series and numerous other games. ''Mario Bros.'' has been re-released for the [[Wii]]'s, [[Nintendo 3DS]]'s, and [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] services in Japan, North America, Europe and Australia. It has also been re-released through [[Nintendo Switch Online]].\n\n[[Mario]] is portrayed as an Italian-American plumber who, along with his brother [[Luigi]], has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers. The gameplay focuses on Mario and Luigi defeating the creatures by flipping them on their backs and kicking them away. The original versions of ''Mario Bros.''\u2014the arcade version and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System]] (FC/NES) version\u2014were received positively by critics.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n[[File: Mario Bros.

The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back.  Each phase is a series of platforms with pipes at each corner of the screen, along with an object called a \"POW\" block in the center. Phases use [[wraparound (video games)|wraparound]], meaning that enemies and players that go off to one side will reappear on the opposite side.\n\nThe player gains points by defeating multiple enemies consecutively and can participate in a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has a certain number of enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.\n\nThere are four enemies: the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which requires two hits to flip over; the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform; and the Slipice, which turns platforms into slippery ice. When bumped from below, the Slipice dies immediately instead of flipping over; these enemies do not count toward the total number that must be defeated to complete a phase. All iced platforms return to normal at the start of each new phase.\n\nThe \"POW\" block flips all enemies touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below. It can be used three times before it disappears. In the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' in-game Player-Versus-Player version of this minigame, each of the three uses causes the opponent to lose a card and all the enemies to be flipped over. Another feature in this small remake is that the pipes are straight, occasionally spitting out large fireballs at the two plumbers. When any enemy type except a Slipice is defeated, a coin appears and can be picked up for bonus points; however, the phase ends as soon as the last enemy is defeated.\n\nAs the game progresses, elements are added to increase the difficulty. Fireballs either bounce around the screen or travel directly from one side to the other, and icicles form under the platforms and at times on the top of the pipes and fall loose. Bonus rounds give the players a chance to score extra points and lives by collecting coins without having to deal with enemies; the \"POW\" block regenerates itself on each of these screens.\n\n==Development==\n[[File: Shigeru Miyamoto GDC 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a middle-aged Japanese man|Shigeru Miyamoto ''(pictured)'' and Gunpei Yokoi collaborated on the design of ''Mario Bros.'']]\n''Mario Bros.'' was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead developers for the video game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. In ''Donkey Kong'', Mario dies if he falls too far. For ''Mario Bros.'', Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto that Mario should be able to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was not sure of, thinking that it would make it \"not much of a game.\" He eventually agreed, thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario \"jumping and bouncing around\", which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors. However, it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they've been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below.<ref name=\"wii\">{{Cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page1.jsp |title=Wii.com - Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros.

It was created by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. It has been featured as a [[minigame]] in all of the ''[[Super Mario Advance]]'' series and numerous other games. ''Mario Bros.'' has been re-released for the [[Wii]]'s, [[Nintendo 3DS]]'s, and [[Wii U]]'s [[Virtual Console]] services in Japan, North America, Europe and Australia. It has also been re-released through [[Nintendo Switch Online]].\n\n[[Mario]] is portrayed as an Italian-American plumber who, along with his brother [[Luigi]], has to defeat creatures that have been coming from the sewers. The gameplay focuses on Mario and Luigi exterminating the creatures by flipping them on their backs and kicking them away. The original versions of ''Mario Bros.''\u2014the arcade version and the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Family Computer/Nintendo Entertainment System]] (FC/NES) version\u2014were received positively by critics.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n[[File: Mario Bros.

The mechanics of ''Mario Bros.'' involve only running and jumping. Unlike future ''Mario'' games, players cannot jump on enemies and squash them, unless they were already turned on their back.  Each phase is a series of platforms with pipes at each corner of the screen, along with an object called a \"POW\" block in the center. Phases use [[wraparound (video games)|wraparound]], meaning that enemies and players that go off to one side will reappear on the opposite side.\n\nThe player gains points by defeating multiple enemies consecutively and can participate in a bonus round to gain more points. Enemies are defeated by kicking them over once they have been flipped on their back. This is accomplished by hitting the platform the enemy is on directly beneath them. If the player allows too much time to pass after doing this, the enemy will flip itself back over, changing in color and increasing speed. Each phase has a certain number of enemies, with the final enemy immediately changing color and increasing to maximum speed. Hitting a flipped enemy from underneath causes it to right itself and start moving again, but it does not change speed or color.\n\nThere are four enemies: the Shellcreeper, which simply walks around; the Sidestepper, which requires two hits to flip over; the Fighter Fly, which moves by jumping and can only be flipped when it is touching a platform; and the Slipice, which turns platforms into slippery ice. When bumped from below, the Slipice dies immediately instead of flipping over; these enemies do not count toward the total number that must be defeated to complete a phase. All iced platforms return to normal at the start of each new phase.\n\nThe \"POW\" block flips all enemies touching a platform or the floor when a player hits it from below. It can be used three times before it disappears. In the ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' in-game Player-Versus-Player version of this minigame, each of the three uses causes the opponent to lose a card and all the enemies to be flipped over. Another feature in this small remake is that the pipes are straight, occasionally spitting out large fireballs at the two plumbers. When any enemy type except a Slipice is defeated, a coin appears and can be picked up for bonus points; however, the phase ends as soon as the last enemy is defeated.\n\nAs the game progresses, elements are added to increase the difficulty. Fireballs either bounce around the screen or travel directly from one side to the other, and icicles form under the platforms and at times on the top of the pipes and fall loose. Bonus rounds give the players a chance to score extra points and lives by collecting coins without having to deal with enemies; the \"POW\" block regenerates itself on each of these screens.\n\n==Development==\n[[File: Shigeru Miyamoto GDC 2007.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of a middle-aged Japanese man|Shigeru Miyamoto ''(pictured)'' and Gunpei Yokoi collaborated on the design of ''Mario Bros.'']]\n''Mario Bros.'' was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and Gunpei Yokoi, two of the lead developers for the video game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]''. In ''Donkey Kong'', Mario dies if he falls too far. For ''Mario Bros.'', Yokoi suggested to Miyamoto that Mario should be able to fall from any height, which Miyamoto was not sure of, thinking that it would make it \"not much of a game.\" He eventually agreed, thinking it would be okay for him to have some superhuman abilities. He designed a prototype that had Mario \"jumping and bouncing around\", which he was satisfied with. The element of combating enemies from below was introduced after Yokoi suggested it, observing that it would work since there were multiple floors. However, it proved to be too easy to eliminate enemies this way, which the developers fixed by requiring players to touch the enemies after they've been flipped to defeat them. This was also how they introduced the turtle as an enemy, which they conceived as an enemy that could only be hit from below.<ref name=\"wii\">{{Cite web |url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page1.jsp |title=Wii.com - Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros.

By the Victorian era the area had seen significant development as London expanded, with dense industrial, commercial and residential buildings located adjacent to one another. The changes brought by [[World War II]] altered much of the fabric of Lambeth. Subsequent development in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has seen an increase in the number of high-rise buildings. The area is home to the [[International Maritime Organization]].\n\n==History==\nThe origins of the name of Lambeth come from its first record in 1062 as ''Lambehitha'', meaning 'landing place for lambs', and in 1255 as ''Lambeth''.

With the opening of [[Westminster Bridge]] in 1750, followed by the [[Blackfriars Bridge]], [[Vauxhall Bridge]] and [[Lambeth Bridge]] itself, a number of major thoroughfares were developed through Lambeth, such as Westminster Bridge Road, Kennington Road and Camberwell New Road.<ref name=Borough/> Until the 18th century Lambeth was still partly rural in nature, being outside the boundaries of central London, although it had experienced growth in the form of [[taverns]] and entertainment venues, such as theatres and [[Bear pit]]s (being outside inner city regulations).<ref name=LambethWalk>{{cite web |url=http://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/lambeth-pharmacy-walk.pdf |title=Lambeth Pharmacy Walk |publisher=Royal Pharmaceutical Society |access-date=30 November 2016}}</ref> The subsequent growth in road and marine transport, along with the development of industry in the wake of the [[industrial revolution]] brought great change to the area.<ref name=LambethWalk/>\n\nThe area grew with an ever-increasing population at this time, many of whom were considerably poor.<ref name=LambethWalk/> As a result, Lambeth opened a parish [[workhouse]] in 1726. In 1777 a parliamentary report recorded a parish workhouse in operation accommodating up to 270 inmates. On 18 December 1835 the Lambeth Poor Law Parish was formed, comprising the parish of St Mary, Lambeth, \"including the district attached to the new churches of St John, Waterloo, Kennington, Brixton, Norwood\". Its operation was overseen by an elected Board of twenty Guardians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.workhouses.org.uk/Lambeth/ |title=Lambeth (Parish of St Mary), Surrey, London |publisher=workhouses.org |access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref> Following in the tradition of earlier delftware manufacturers, the [[Royal Doulton]] Pottery company had their principal manufacturing site in Lambeth for several centuries.<ref name=WhiteHart/> The Lambeth factory closed in 1956 and production was transferred to [[Staffordshire]].

With the massive urban development of London in the 19th century and with the opening of the large Waterloo railway station in 1848 the locality around the station and Lower Marsh became known as [[Waterloo, London|Waterloo]], becoming an area distinct from Lambeth itself.<ref name=\"Mills\"/>\n\nThe Lambeth Ragged school was built in 1851 to help educate the children of destitute facilities, although the widening of the [[London and South Western Railway]] in 1904 saw the building reduced in size.<ref name=LambethWalk/> Part of the school building still exists today and is occupied by the [[Beaconsfield (gallery)|Beaconsfield Gallery]].<ref name=LambethWalk/> The Beaufoy Institute was also built in 1907 to provide technical education for the poor of the area, although this stopped being an educational institution at the end of the 20th century.<ref name=LambethWalk/>\n\n[[Lambeth Walk]] and Lambeth High Street were the two principal commercial streets of Lambeth, but today are predominantly residential in nature.

By the Victorian era the area had seen significant development as London expanded, with dense industrial, commercial and residential buildings located adjacent to one another.

Subsequent development in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has seen an increase in the number of high-rise buildings. The area is home to the [[International Maritime Organization]].\n\n==History==\nThe origins of the name of Lambeth come from its first record in 1062 as ''Lambehitha'', meaning 'landing place for lambs', and in 1255 as ''Lambeth''.

The Conservative candidates Rachel Wolf and Kim Caddy finished the runner up in Dulwich & West Norwood and Streatham respectively.\n \nAt the [[2018 Lambeth London Borough Council election|2018 local elections]], Labour remained in control of the council with 57 of the 63 seats, (down 2 seats from 2014). The Greens gained 4 seats and achieved a total 5 seats. The Conservatives were reduced down to a single seat, and the Liberal Democrats failed to gain any seats, but did make some inroads into Wards in Northern Vauxhall and Southern Streatham. \n\nIn the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 EU elections]], the Liberal Democrats won Lambeth with 33% of the vote, Labour were second with 21%, The Greens third with 19% and [[Change UK]] and [[The Brexit Party]] joint fourth on 8%.\n\nIn June 2019, Umunna defected to the Liberal Democrats.\n\nHoey stood down at the 2019 General Election and was replaced with Labour MP [[Florence Eshalomi]], who was the sitting London Assembly Member for Lambeth and Southwark. Ummuna stood down as an MP and was replaced with [[Bell Ribeiro-Addy]] where the Labour majority was cut by almost 10,000 by the 2nd placed Lib Dems. Hayes stood for re-election with the Green Party\u2019s [[Jonathan Bartley]] finishing in second place, for the first time.\n\n==Buildings and churches==\nThe church of [[Garden Museum|St Mary-at-Lambeth]] is the oldest above ground structure in Lambeth, the oldest structure of any kind being the crypt of Lambeth Palace itself.<ref name=\"StMary's\">{{cite web |url=http://gardenmuseum.org.uk/page/the-church-local-history |title=St Mary \u2013 A history|publisher=The Garden Museum |access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref> The church has pre-Norman origins, being recorded as early as 1062 as a church built by Goda, sister of [[Edward the Confessor]].

The embankment includes land reclaimed from the river and various small timber and boat-building yards, and was intended to protect low-lying areas of Lambeth from flooding while also providing a new highway to bypass local congested streets. Unlike the [[Thames Embankment]] on the opposite side of the river, the Albert Embankment does not incorporate major interceptor sewers. This allowed the southern section of the embankment (upstream from Lambeth Bridge) to include a pair of tunnels leading to a small slipway, named [[White Hart Draw Dock]], whose origins can be traced back to the 14th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plaquesoflondon.co.uk/page3790.htm |title=White Hart Dock |publisher=Plaques of London |access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref> Centuries later, Royal Doulton's pottery works used the docks to load clay and finished goods for transport to and from the [[Port of London]].

Administered by the [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL), the team is nicknamed The Lions.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, the Great Britain team toured overseas, played against foreign touring teams and competed in the [[Rugby League World Cup]], which they won three times, in [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|1954]], [[1960 Rugby League World Cup|1960]] and [[1972 Rugby League World Cup|1972]].\n\nSince [[1995 Rugby League World Cup|1995]], the RFL has sent separate [[home nations]] teams to the World Cup. Great Britain continued to compete as a Test playing nation both home and away. They competed against Australia for [[The Ashes (rugby league)|the Ashes]], and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] for the [[Baskerville Shield]], as well the [[Rugby League Tri-Nations|Tri-Nations]] series with both Australia and New Zealand. Great Britain also played in series and tours against [[France national rugby league team|France]], [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]] and [[Fiji national rugby league team|Fiji]].\n\nIn 2006, the RFL announced that after the [[2007 All Golds Tour]] the Great Britain team would no longer compete on a regular basis, and its players would represent [[England national rugby league team|England]], [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] and [[Scotland national rugby league team|Scotland]] at Test level.<ref name=RLSL>[http://www.sportinglife.com/rugbyleague/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=rleague/06/11/08/RUGBYL_Tri-Nations_Lewis.html Sporting Life]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210062109/http://www.sportinglife.com/rugbyleague/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=rleague%2F06%2F11%2F08%2FRUGBYL_Tri-Nations_Lewis.html |date=10 February 2012 }}</ref> It is planned that the Great Britain team will come together in future only for occasional tours, similar to the [[British and Irish Lions]] in [[rugby union]].\n\nOn 9 May 2017, it was confirmed that the [[2019 Great Britain Lions tour|Great Britain team would tour the southern hemisphere in 2019]] as the Great Britain Lions.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/39857448</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early years===\nInitially Great Britain were represented by a team made up of players from the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]], known simply as the \"Northern Union\" side. On 25 January 1908, the first ever Great Britain test match took place at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium]], [[Leeds]], versus New Zealand. At the time, Great Britain were referred to as the \"Northern Union\" \u2013 they won the game 14\u20136 before a crowd of 8,000. The second test went to [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] by 18\u20136, before 14,000 at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], London. The third test was played at [[Cheltenham]], and 4,000 watched New Zealand win 8\u20135.\n\nThe first [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] arrived in England on 27 September 1908, they toured Britain, losing more games than they won. They played their first ever test against the Northern Union in December at [[Loftus Road]], London; a last minute penalty against the Kangaroos for an obstruction play handed England a goal and a 22-all draw in front of a crowd of 2,000. The second test in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in January 1909 attracted a crowd of 22,000, and the Northern Union won 15\u20135. The third test was played at [[Villa Park]], Birmingham, the Northern Union winning again 6\u20135 before a crowd of 9,000. The Australians suggested that the series should be named \"[[Rugby League Ashes|the Ashes]]\" after the cricket series of the same name.\n\n[[File:Touring squad of the 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The first British touring team.]]The first British tour of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] began on 4 June 1910 captained by [[James Lomas (rugby league)|James Lomas]].

But they won the first test in Sydney against Australia 27\u201320 in front of 42,000 at the old Sydney Showground. They then won the second test in [[Brisbane]] 22\u201317. The tourists also recorded a 13-all draw against a combined Australasian side in front of over 42,000 at the Agricultural Ground. These tests have been credited as making [[rugby league]] the predominate code of [[rugby football]] in Australia, a situation which continues to this day.

After sharing the first two tests, Great Britain finished with only 10 men due to injuries, but still managed to hang on for a 14\u20136 victory in Sydney in July 1914. It was dubbed \"[[Rorke's Drift test]]\", after a battle in the [[Anglo-Zulu War]].

They were presented with the Ashes Trophy by the Australians, which the two countries have competed for ever since.\n\nGreat Britain then set off for [[New Zealand]], where they lost the first Test. On Saturday 18 August 1928 the Lions travelled to [[Tahuna Park]], [[Dunedin]], for the second Test. The Lions led 7\u20135 at the interval and went on to win 13\u20135. Seven days later the Lions won the third Test 6\u20135 to clinch the series two Tests to one. Before coming home they played some missionary games in [[Canada national rugby league team|Canada]], which led to the formation of a rugby league competition in that country.\n\nOn 5 October 1929, Australia won the first Test at [[The Boulevard (stadium)|the Boulevard]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] 31\u20138. Great Britain won the second 9\u20133 at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Headingley]], [[Leeds]] on 9 November 1929. The third test, held at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]], resulted in a 0\u20130 draw with Australia having a try disallowed in the last minute. With the series tied 1\u20131, an unprecedented fourth test was played at the [[Athletic Grounds, Greater Manchester|Athletic Grounds]], [[Rochdale]]. Britain won the test 3\u20130 to take the Ashes.\n\nBritain again won the Ashes in 1932. In 1932 the police locked the SCG gates after 70,204 crammed into the SCG. This would remain the world record test match attendance until eclipsed by the 73,631 who attended the [[1992 Rugby League World Cup Final|1992 World Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1933 in Paris, England and Australia play the first game of rugby league in France. The match was one sided, with Australia winning 63\u201313 in front of a crowd of 5,000, but the seed was sown.\n\n[[Jim Sullivan (rugby league)|Jim Sullivan]] was asked to go again as captain of the 1936 tourists, but declined on the grounds of his wife's ill health. Britain again won the Ashes in 1936.\n\n===Post-war===\n\nThe 1946 Lions tour saw the team sail to Australia on [[HMS Indomitable (92)|HMS Indomitable]]. After a five-day train journey across Australia, [[Gus Risman]]'s team retained the Ashes, drawing the first Test and winning the other two Tests to become the only touring side to remain unbeaten on a tour of Australia.\n\nIn 1947, [[Roy Francis (rugby)|Roy Francis]] was the first of a long line of black players, to be capped by Great Britain.\n\nAustralia made their 7th tour to the UK in 1948, and this time play the Ashes series against a side officially called Great Britain. Great Britain win both games 16\u20137 and 23\u201321.\n\nIn 1950, the British Lions returned to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] soundly beating a full Western Australia team at Claremont Showground. In The Ashes series against [[Clive Churchill]]'s Australians, the 1950 touring side led by [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]]'s [[Ernest Ward]] had the unfortunate distinction of being the first England/Great Britain team to lose the Ashes since 1920.

Great Britain drew one and lost one of the fixtures: France won 20\u201318 at Stade Municipal, Toulouse. On 65 minutes a colossal brawl erupted when Georges Fages kicked [[Derek Turner]] on the chin following a tackle on Fages. When the dust settled Turner was ordered off, but five minutes elapsed before he was finally escorted from the field by [[Bill Fallowfield]], secretary of the [[Rugby Football League]]. There was 17\u201317 draw at [[Knowsley Road]], [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]].\n\nIn 1960, the World Cup was played on home soil. The tournament is decided on a league system but with both Great Britain and Australia undefeated, the last match became a virtual World Cup Final. [[Eric Ashton]] lifted the trophy after a 10\u20133 victory at [[Odsal Stadium|Odsal]] in front of a crowd of 32,733 and Britain played in an exhibition game in lieu of a decider.<ref name=\"RLWC\"/>\n\nIn December 1960, Great Britain beat France 21\u201310 at [[Stade Andr\u00e9 Moga]], Bordeaux, and in January 1961, they won again 27\u20138 at Knowsley Road, St Helens. New Zealand toured Great Britain in 1961. They won the first of the three matches 29\u201311 at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium]], [[Leeds]].\n\nEric Ashton was again captain of the 1962 Lions side and [[Colin Hutton]] was coach. The British Lions won the opening two Tests 31\u201312 and then 17\u201310, the first time in 34 years that they had won the first two matches on Australian soil. The first Test was played before more than 70,000 spectators. The third Test was staged at [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] on Saturday 14 July 1962. A controversial last-minute Australian try and the subsequent touchline conversion resulted in a 17\u201318 defeat; but for this, the 62 Lions would have been the first team to achieve a whitewash of the Australians.<ref name=\"Nil\"/>\n\nAfter crossing the [[Tasman Sea]] to New Zealand, they lost both Tests against New Zealand with a team depleted with injuries. The first Test 19\u20130, only the second time a British team had been held scoreless. In the second Test at [[Carlaw Park]], [[Auckland]] on Saturday 11 August 1962, several players had to play out of position and New Zealand won 27\u20138. Sixteen Lions visited South Africa on the way home and played three matches against South Africa. The second of those matches took place on Saturday 25 August in Durban, Great Britain won 39\u201333.\n\nIn 1962, Great Britain were defeated 17\u201312 by France at [[Stade Gilbert Brutus]], [[Perpignan]].\n\nIn 1963, Great Britain were defeated 2\u20131 in the Ashes series by the touring [[Kangaroo Tour|1963 Kangaroos]]. After the Aussies had won the first test 28\u20132 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in front of only 13,946 fans, the second test was scheduled for [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]] in [[Municipal Borough of Swinton and Pendlebury|Swinton]]. In what became known as the \"Swinton Massacre\", the Kangaroos wrapped up the series with a 50\u201312 win over the Lions, including 3 tries by [[Ken Irvine]], 2 each to [[Reg Gasnier]] and [[Peter Dimond]], while [[Graeme Langlands]] scored two himself as well as kicking seven goals. The Lions avoided a series whitewash with a hard fought 16\u20135 win in the third test at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium]], [[Leeds]] which is regarded as one of the most brutal tests played between the two teams. Referee \"Sergeant Major\" [[Eric Clay]] was prominent when he sent off Lions blind-side prop (10) [[Cliff Watson]], as well as Australians [[Brian Hambly]] and [[Barry Muir]]. After giving Clay a few 'choice words' as he left the field, Muir later spoke to Clay claiming the English referee had robbed the Australians. According to Muir, Clay's response was ''\"Barry, I've got to live here.\"''\n\nGreat Britain beat France 12\u20130 in Avignon in 1964, they also won the return leg 10\u20130 in Leeds but were booed off the field.

Great Britain won 22, drew one and lost one \u2013 making them the most successful British tourists to date.\n\nThe fifth [[Rugby League World Cup]] was held in England in November 1970. Britain were hot favourites, and won all three of their group stage games. All the other nations lost two games each, and Australia qualified for the final largely on the back of an impressive tally of points against New Zealand. The final was held at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium]], [[Leeds]]. Although Great Britain dominated the possession, the Kangaroos were able to exploit their chances, and ran out unexpected 12\u20137 winners in a scrappy, bad-tempered game that became known as \"The Battle of Leeds\".\n\nIn 1971 New Zealand wins a series in Britain for the first time, winning 17\u201314 in Castleford and 18\u201313 in Salford.\n[[Clive Sullivan]] had risen to the Great Britain captaincy, the first black captain of a home international side, and was in charge for the 1972 World Cup held in France. [[Jim Challinor]] was coach. Sullivan and Challinor led the under-rated Lions to victory over Australia (27\u201321), France (13\u20134) and New Zealand (53\u201319), claiming a try in each game. Clive scored a long distance try in the final in [[Stade Gerland]], [[Lyon]] as they drew with Australia 10\u201310 after extra time.<ref name=\"RLWC\"/> Great Britain won their third World Cup by virtue of having a better qualifying record.

The Australian's won the first Ashes Test 12\u20136 at Lang Park, but bounced back to win the 2nd test at the Sydney Cricket Ground 16\u201311. The deciding test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 20 July was won 22\u201318 by the home side.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/ashes-series-1974/summary.html 1974 Ashes series]</ref> In New Zealand, the Kiwis won the first Test 13\u20138. The second Test was staged at the Addington Showgrounds, Christchurch on Saturday 4 August 1974 and was won by Great Britain 17\u20138. Britain went on to win the third Test 20\u20130 to clinch the series.\n\nGreat Britain did not compete in the 1975 World Cup as the UK was represented by teams from England and Wales for the first time in a World Cup.\n\nOn 6 July 1975, at Boroko, [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] played their first ever international. They were beaten 40\u201312 by Great Britain.\n\nThere was a reappearance for the Great Britain team at the [[1977 Rugby League World Cup|1977 World Cup]] in Australasia under coach [[David Watkins (rugby)|David Watkins]]. Australia topped the table and Great Britain were the underdogs going to the [[1977 Rugby League World Cup Final|Final]], held at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. They managed to dominate the possession, and it took a last minute try from Australia's [[John Kolc]] to win the Cup 13\u201312 in front of 24,457 spectators.\n\nThe [[The Ashes (rugby league)|1978 Ashes series]] were won by the touring Australians, but Great Britain, labelled a Dads' Army team thanks to their front row with both props ([[Jim Mills (rugby league)|Jim Mills]] and [[Brian Lockwood]]) and hooker ([[Tony Fisher (rugby)|Tony Fisher]]) all being over 30 years of age, beat the Kangaroos in the second test 18\u201314, at [[Bradford]]'s [[Odsal Stadium]], before a crowd of 26,447. It was to be 10 years, and 15 consecutive test defeats before Britain beat the Kangaroos again. [[Peter Fox (rugby league, born 1933)|Peter Fox]] was the coach.\n\nThe tour of Australasia in 1979 was a disastrous one in many ways. A number of players withdrew because of injury, and coach [[Eric Ashton]] was unable to fly out with his squad because his daughter had been involved in a car crash. Injuries during the tour caused three influential players to return home early, whilst attendance figures at tour matches were disappointing due to the lacklustre performances of the tourists, and led to a financial loss of over \u00a3300,000 on the trip. The Australian's, coached by [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]] and captained by [[George Peponis]], won the series 3\u20130. Australian centre [[Michael Cronin (rugby league)|Michael Cronin]] scored a total of 54 points for the series with two tries and 24 goals. Incredibly he outscored the Lions who only scored 18 points for the entire series, losing the first test 35\u20130 in Brisbane, and the second and third tests 24\u201316 and 28\u20132 in Sydney. Total attendance for the series was just 66,752 compared to the 133,791 who saw the three tests on the 1974 Lions tour. Critics from both Britain and Australia called the team the weakest and least committed touring side ever to tour Australia and that poor results had been the cause of such a dramatic drop in attendances.\n\nThe first Test at Lang Park in Brisbane was staged on Saturday 16 June 1979, and attracted a healthy crowd of 23,051, although it was actually the lowest for an Anglo-Australian Test in Australia for over sixty years. After a string of encouraging results in the opening matches; Britain were confident of pulling off an upset. However the Lions, 16\u20130 down at half-time, crashed to a 35\u20130 defeat, the heaviest Britain had suffered in a Test played in Australia.<ref name=\"Long\"/> The tour's largest attendance came in the second test at the SCG with 26,857. But the third test could only draw 16,844 to the SCG, at the time the lowest ever attendance in Australia for an Anglo-Australian test.\n\n===1980s===\n\n[[Johnny Whiteley]] became coach again in 1980 until 1982. He achieved a drawn series against New Zealand in [[1980 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France|1980]], but was given a tougher time by the touring Australians.\n\nRugby league was taken into a new dimension by the 1982 Kangaroos side. The '[[The Invincibles (Rugby League)|Invincibles]]' became the first team to win every game of the tour (15 games) including the first test by 40\u20134 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators at [[Boothferry Park]]. The Kangaroos only led 10\u20134 at half time, but unleashed a second half onslaught that left the British game stunned. Coached by [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]] and captained by [[Max Krilich]], the Kangaroos included veterans such as [[Craig Young]], [[Steve Rogers (rugby league)|Steve Rogers]], [[Kerry Boustead]], the fiery [[Les Boyd]], [[Rod Reddy]] and [[Ray Price (rugby)|Ray Price]], as well as a crop of young players on their way to superstar status in rugby league including [[Mal Meninga]], tour vice-captain [[Wally Lewis]], [[Brett Kenny]], [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], [[Eric Grothe Sr.|Eric Grothe]] and [[Wayne Pearce]]. The second test in Wigan ended 27\u20136 to the visitors. During the second half of that game, Kangaroos replacement Wally Lewis fired a bullet like 20 metre pass for Meninga to score in the corner. Soundly thrashed to that point of the series, the play did psychological damage to the Lions who were left wondering just how good the Australians really were if someone who could pass like Lewis couldn't even make the starting XIII. The third test was held at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Headingley]], [[Leeds]] which ended 32\u20138, though the game was in the balance until the final ten minutes when the Kangaroos superior fitness told and they ran in four late tries. The Lions scored their only try of the series in the second half at Headingley when Hull winger [[Steve Evans (rugby league)|Steve Evans]] scored. This was the beginning of an era of Australian dominance.\n\n[[Frank Myler]] took over as coach following the Invincibles tour. Great Britain toured Australia in 1984 and both [[Garry Schofield]] and [[Ellery Hanley]] made their test d\u00e9buts, with 18 year old Schofield in particular earning praise from the Australian's with his attacking displays in the centres (Hanley, better known later in his career as a lock forward or five-eighth, played on the wing for each test of the series). After losing the first two Tests, Britain was expected to capitulate completely in the third Test, which was staged at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday 7 July 1984.<ref name=\"Oz\">{{cite web | url= http://www.totalrl.com/onthisday/index.php?feat_id=205 | archive-url= https://archive.is/20070607074641/http://www.totalrl.com/onthisday/index.php?feat_id=205 | url-status= dead | archive-date= 7 June 2007 | title=Aussies whitewash '84 Lions | publisher=Totalrl.com | author=Don Yates | accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Lions then moved on to New Zealand where the Kiwis won the first two Tests in Auckland and Christchurch and the Lions faced the prospect of losing each match of a three-Test series against the Kiwis for the first time. On Saturday 28 July 1984, the Third Test was held at Carlaw Park, Auckland. The Lions started well and went into a 16\u20138 lead in the second half before New Zealand recovered to score 24 points in the last 25 minutes and win 32\u201316. It was the first time they had scored over 30 points in a Test match against Great Britain.\n\n[[Maurice Bamford]] took over as coach in 1984. His term as coach of the national side also included the formation of the Great Britain under-21 team to replace the U/24 side. The ninth [[Rugby League World Cup]] was played out between [[1985-88 Rugby League World Cup|1985 and 1988]], with teams playing each other on a home and away basis. These matches were fitted into the normal international programme of three-match test series between the nations, with a pre-designated match from each series counting as the world cup fixture.\n\nIn 1985, Garry Schofield re-wrote the record books by scoring four tries as Great Britain beat New Zealand in a test series at Central Park, Wigan. [[Shaun Edwards]] made his debut for Great Britain against France in 1985 at Headingley. Britain went on to beat France 50\u20134, a record score.\n\nIn 1986 a then record northern hemisphere crowd of 50,383 attends the first test of the Ashes series at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]]. The Australians won 38\u201316, continuing their dominance of The Lions. The [[1986 Kangaroo tour|1986 Kangaroos]], who like their 1982 counterparts (and included 5 players from \"The Invincibles\" \u2013 Wally Lewis (captain), Peter Sterling (vice-captain), Mal Meninga, Brett Kenny and [[Gene Miles]]) went through Great Britain and France undefeated and earned the nickname \"The Unbeatables\". The second test at [[Elland Road]] in Leeds was a disaster for the Lions with the Kangaroos leading 34-0 late in the match before winning 34-4 after Schofield scored a late consolation try. Australia completed the series sweep when they won the third test at Wigan 24-15 after a much improved performance by Maurice Bamford's men.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/ashes-series-1986/summary.html 1986 Ashes series at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\n[[Mal Reilly]] was appointed Head Coach in 1987 and opened with six wins, four against France and two over Papua New Guinea. In 1987, Ellery Hanley was appointed Great Britain captain and on the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour|1988 tour]] down under took the Lions the closest they had been for a decade to regaining the Ashes. On 9 July 1988, Great Britain beat Australia 26\u201312 in Sydney to win the 3rd test, though the series had already been lost. This was the first British victory over Australia since their 18\u201314 win at the Odsal Stadium in Bradford on 5 November 1978. The third test also saw the smallest Anglo-Australian test attendance in Australia when only 15,944 attended the [[dead rubber]] game at the new [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. The first test played on 11 June and won 17\u20136 by Australia in front of 24,480 at the Sydney Football Stadium, was the 100th Anglo-Australian test match.\n\nDuring that 1988 tour, the Lions suffered two embarrassing losses in the lead up to the first test against Australia. The Lions lost 36\u201312 to a Northern Division (NSW) representative team in [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] in what was called \"Black Sunday\". According to reports, after the game Mal Reilly locked his team in the change room and upbraided them for 20 minutes before allowing the media in.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McGregor|first1=Adrian|title=Simply The Best: The 1990 Kangaroos|date=1991|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Qld|isbn=0 7022 2370 0|page=55 The Fall and Rise of England}}</ref> But worse was to come just 2 days later when they lost 30\u20130 to reigning [[1987 NSWRL season|Sydney premiers]] [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]] only 4 days out from the test. The Manly team that night, missing 7 regular players (including 4 Australian test players), were coached by Mal Reilly's [[1972 NSWRFL season|1972]] and [[1973 NSWRFL season|1973]] Sydney premiership winning teammate [[Bob Fulton]] who would become the Australian coach in 1989 and spend almost a decade tormenting the Lions.\n\nThe final group stage match of the 1985/88 World Cup qualifier between New Zealand and Great Britain became a sudden death battle for a spot in the final, Britain only needed a draw. In the event the Kiwis came through 12\u201310, and went on to lose to Australia in the [[1988 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] at [[Eden Park]], [[Auckland]].\n\nThe tenth [[Rugby League World Cup]] followed a similar format covering the years [[1989-92 Rugby League World Cup|1989 and 1992]]. In 1989 Great Britain won their first home series since 1965, beating New Zealand by two tests to one. With France and Papua New Guinea not being competitive, it became a straight fight between Britain and the Kiwis for the right to meet the Kangaroos in the final. In the event the Lions were able to just edge out the Kiwis on points difference.\n\n===1990s: Super League War===\nFrance gained their first win in 23 years across the Channel in 1990 when they won 25\u201318 at Headingley.\n\nIn 1990, Great Britain made their first full-scale tour of Papua New Guinea. A combination of soaring temperatures, altitude and the atmosphere created by over 11,500 Papua New Guinea fans, many clinging to trees outside the tiny, ramshackle ground in [[Goroka]], unnerved the tourists. Papua New Guinea beat Great Britain 20\u201318, the Lions' one and only loss to the Kumuls. This saw the series tied 1\u20131.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/papua-new-guinea-vs-great-britain-1990/summary.html 1990 PNG vs GB at Rugby League Project]</ref> Great Britain then won a series 2\u20131 in New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/new-zealand-vs-great-britain-1990/summary.html 1990 NZ vs GB at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1990 Ashes series]], Great Britain defeated Australia 19\u201312 in the first test at Wembley on Saturday 27 October 1990 in front of a new record home crowd of 54,567. It was the first time that an Australian team had been beaten in Britain for twelve years and 37 matches.<ref name=\"Aussies defeated\">{{cite web|url=http://www.totalrl.com/onthisday/index.php?feat_id=270 |title=When Britain defeated the Aussies |publisher=Totalrl.com |author=Don Yates |date= |accessdate=11 March 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Australia made eight changes for the second Test, held at Old Trafford on Saturday 10 November 1990. With the scores tied at 10\u201310, with twenty seconds to go, Kangaroos halfback [[Ricky Stuart]] raced 70 metres before slipping the ball to Mal Meninga who dived over to give the Kangaroos a 14\u201310 victory. The third Test was won by Australia 14\u20130 to complete a 2\u20131 series win.<ref name=\"TV game\"/>\n\nDuring the [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand|1992 tour of Australia and New Zealand]], Great Britain lost the first [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes]] test 22\u20136 in Sydney. Two weeks later, led by [[Garry Schofield]] and with a pack made up entirely of Wigan players, Great Britain grabbed a memorable 33\u201310 win in Melbourne on a night where the weather and (neutral) [[Princes Park (stadium)|ground]] was more like a winters night in northern England than 'sunny' Australia.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epT4-ZaHBlw&t=3s Australia v Great Britain (10-33) - 1992 Rugby League 2nd Ashes Test]</ref> However, back in familiar territory, Australia won the third test 16\u201310 in Brisbane.\n\nThe [[1989-92 Rugby League World Cup]] was played out over three-years, the Great Britain side squeezed into the final on goal difference ahead of New Zealand. The [[1992 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] at Wembley set a world record attendance for a rugby league international: 73,631 saw Australia edge Great Britain 10\u20136 with the only try coming from [[Steve Renouf]] late in the game. This figure beat the previous record of 70,204 set at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] during the [[1932 Ashes series]].<ref name=\"RLWC\"/> The attendance figure at Wembley would remain the largest for an international until 74,468 saw the Kangaroos defeat New Zealand 34\u20132 in the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup Final|2013 World Cup Final]] at Old Trafford. The 1992 Final was set to be played in Australia due to the Kangaroos finishing unbeaten at the top of the table. However, with the prospect of a 70,000+ attendance at Wembley on offer, the [[Australian Rugby League]] consented to the game being held in London.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/world-cup-1989-92/summary.html 1989-1992 Rugby League World Cup]</ref>\n\nGreat Britain won the 1993 home series against New Zealand by three tests to nil, including a 17\u20130 victory at Wembley in the first test. During the second test in Wigan, Lions and Wigan winger [[Martin Offiah]]'s reputation as the fastest player in the game, which had taken a big hit when he was defeated in a 100-metre match race with [[Parramatta Eels]] (Australia) flyer [[Lee Oudenryn]] during the 1992 Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, was further dented when he made a break and despite having a 3-metre start, was run down from behind and unceremoniously bundled into touch by Kiwi and Leeds centre [[Kevin Iro]].\n\n[[Mal Reilly]] stood down as Great Britain coach in 1994. [[Ellery Hanley]] was appointed coach of the Great Britain national rugby league team for the Ashes series of 1994, which was held in Great Britain. The [[1994 Kangaroo tour]] was the last played in the conventional format, where the Australian side plays a number of matches against British club and provincial outfits, in addition to the Test matches. Great Britain won the first test 8\u20134 at Wembley after playing most of the game without captain Shaun Edwards who was sent off in the first half for a high tackle on [[Bradley Clyde]]. Without Edwards (suspended) and Wembley man of the match, fullback [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] who had dislocated his shoulder late in the first test, the Lions lost the second test 38\u20138 at Old Trafford. Edwards returned for the third test which was won 23\u20134 by Australia at [[Elland Road]].<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/ashes-series-1994/summary.html 1994 Ashes series]</ref>\n\nIn 1996 Great Britain embarked on a disastrous tour of the Southern Hemisphere under coach [[Phil Larder]]. They did not play Australia because of the [[Super League War]], but played and won their first and so far only test against [[Fiji national rugby league team|Fiji]], before losing a series 3\u20130 to New Zealand. Several British players had to be sent home early because the tour ran out of money.\n\n[[Andy Goodway]] was appointed Great Britain coach in 1997. At the end of that year Great Britain played a home [[Super League Test series|three-Test series]] against the [[Australian Super League]] and lost 2\u20131. Despite the series being given official test status, these games are not widely regarded as a genuine Ashes series because so many Australian stars were again missing. The continuing Super League war meant that the 1998 Kangaroo Tour was cancelled.\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Super League war]] meant that the next [[Kangaroo tour]], set for 1998, never eventuated.\n\nWith the Super League War finally over in 1999, Great Britain travelled to the Southern Hemisphere for the first Tri-Nations tournament with Australia and New Zealand. Great Britain struggled to overcome Burleigh Bears in a warm-up match, went on to suffer humiliating defeats by world champions Australia and New Zealand, and then struggled to beat the New Zealand Maoris. A huge gap has opened up once again between the northern and southern hemispheres. In January 2000, Andy Goodway quit as Great Britain coach with a year left on his contract [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20000116/ai_n9705732].\n\n===2000-2007: Record defeats and whitewashes===\nIn February 2001, Australian [[David Waite]] was appointed full-time head coach and technical director ahead of the Ashes series. The Australians arrived in Britain for the first Ashes series since 1994. Great Britain surprised everyone by winning the first test, but lost the next two.\n\nIn July 2002 Great Britain suffered a record test defeat 64\u201310 to Australia in Sydney.\n\nIn November 2003 Great Britain lost an Ashes series 0\u20133 on home soil, having led all three matches with less than five minutes to play. This was considered one of the most humiliating defeats in Great Britain Test history, as with injuries and pullouts, Australia had sent a virtually third-choice side to Great Britain. Great Britain was heavily favoured to win the Ashes, but lost each Test. Waite stepped down from his role.\n\nIn 2004, [[Brian Noble (rugby league)|Brian Noble]] was appointed part-time coach. The '...and Ireland' was dropped from the team name as they reverted to 'Great Britain'. The Lions beat Australia in a tournament for the first time in 31 years when they won the league phase of the [[2004 rugby league tri-nations]] with the most points, only to be comprehensively beaten 44\u20134 in the final by Australia.\n\nIn the [[2005 rugby league tri-nations|2005 Tri Nations]], Great Britain only won one game. This came against eventual tournament winners [[New Zealand national rugby league team|the Kiwis]] by over twenty points and dominated the entire match. However, the Kiwis posted their highest score ever against Great Britain in London. Great Britain did not make the final of the tournament.\n\nOn 4 November 2006, Great Britain beat Australia 23\u201312 in Sydney for the first time since 1988 [http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,20702569-23214,00.html]. However, they lost the other three games and went down to a record defeat against New Zealand. They failed to make the final of the tournament for the second year in succession.\n\nAt the end of the 2006 season Brian Noble's contract as Head Coach ran out and was not renewed. It was believed that the RFL were looking for a full-time Head Coach and Brian Noble wasn't willing to surrender his role as [[Wigan Warriors]] Head Coach. In March 2007, Leeds coach, Tony Smith was installed as coach.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/6494011.stm] His first game in charge of Great Britain was the victory over France. The 3\u20130 whitewash of New Zealand followed starting with a 20\u201314 victory at Huddersfield, a 44\u20130 thrashing of the Kiwis in the 2nd test at Hull and a final test win at the JJB by 28 points to 22.\n\n[[File:Great Britain - New Zealand rugby league test, 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The final home Test for Great Britain against New Zealand in 2007.]]In 2007, Great Britain enjoyed a three nil series whitewash of the touring New Zealand side in the [[2007 All Golds tour]].\n\n===2008-2019: Hiatus===\nAfter the [[2007 All Golds tour]] Great Britain was retired with the focus being more on strengthening the other three home nations.\n\nA 2015 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia was approved by the [[RLIF]] however the [[Australian national rugby league team|Australians]] wanted to have a year off before the [[Rugby League Four Nations|2016 Four Nations]].\n\nIn 2016 it was rumoured the Australians want to have a Kangaroos tour of the UK against Great Britain.\n\n===2019 return===\nIn May 2017, it was confirmed that Great Britain would tour the southern hemisphere in 2019, with New Zealand and Australia touring Europe in 2018 and 2020 respectively.\n\nGreat Britain's 2019 began with a 14\u20136 loss against Tonga.  They would go on to lose their following two tour matches against New Zealand before suffering a humiliating loss to Papua New Guinea.  After the tour had concluded, several of the Great Britain players and head coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] came under intense media scrutiny and fan backlash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/rugby-league/49830997/|title=PNG 28-10 Great Britain|website=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/21/wayne-bennett-new-contract-rfl-ralph-rimmer/|title=Wayne Bennett could earn new England contract despite disastrous Lions tour|website=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/rugby-league-news-updates-live-3545618/|title=Rugby League news: Reaction to Great Britain horror show, Hull FC class of 2013, KR's Adam Quinlan motivated|website=Hull Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\n== Team image ==\n===Kit===\n{|\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_thinredhoops|pattern_b=_donbosco|pattern_ra=_thinredhoops|pattern_so=_2 white stripes|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=000000|socks=FF0000|title=1907\u20131920}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_GBR1|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=FFFFFF|title=1921\u20131984}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_GBR1|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_band_red|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0000CD|title=1957\u20131972}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_GBR1985|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_band_red|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=0000FF|title=1985\u20131989}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_GBR1990a|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_band_red|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=0000FF|title=1990\u20131991}}\n|}\n\n{|\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_GBR1992|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=0000FF|title=1992}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_blueborder|pattern_b=_GBR1993|pattern_ra=_blueborder|pattern_so=_bluehorizontal|pattern_sh=_GBR1993|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=FFFFFF|title=1993}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_redborder|pattern_b=_GBR1994a|pattern_ra=_redborder|pattern_so=_band_red|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=0000FF|title=1994}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_bluelower|pattern_b=_GBR1997|pattern_ra=_redlower|pattern_so=_GBR1997|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=0000FF|title=1997\u20131999}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_GBRL|pattern_b=_GBRL|pattern_ra=_blue_stripes2|pattern_so=_GBR1997|pattern_sh=_red_stripes2|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=FFFFFF|title=Primary}}\n|}\n[[File:Great Britain rugby league crest.png|right|150px]]\n\nThe team was originally known as the ''[[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] XIII'' in reference to the name of the sport's governing body. After 1922 the name ''the Lions'' was first used. In 1948 the team became known as ''Great Britain'' for the [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes Series]]. During the 1990s the Rugby Football League expanded this to ''Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', and the jersey bore the name ''British Isles XIII''. In 2004 the words \"''...and Northern Ireland''\" were dropped from the title, though the Irish shamrock continued to form part of the RFL's [[Heraldry|crest]] and ''British Isles XIII'' remained on the jersey. At matches, the team was represented by the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]] and the singing of [[God Save the Queen]], both symbols of the United Kingdom. The practice of a UK-wide team being called ''Great Britain'' has a precedent with the Great British Olympic team, though the formal name of the Olympic team includes \"and Northern Ireland\". The team continued to compete until the [[2007 All Golds Tour]]: henceforth, the Great Britain team will now be reserved for Lions tours of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. According to Richard Lewis, chairman of the Rugby Football League:\n\n:\"It will bring consistency. What I am passionate about is the international game being consistent. To me, it has always been illogical that we play as Great Britain for three or four years, and when the World Cup comes along, suddenly we become England. In the major competitions, which will be most years, we will play as England. That will also allow Scotland and Wales to develop. We have then floated the concept of Great Britain to tour in 2010. It would be a tour as opposed to playing a formal competition, and I wouldn't restrict that to just Australia and New Zealand.\"<ref>[http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyleague/story/0,10069,1656696,00.html England to take pride of place over Britain] The Guardian, 3 December 2005</ref>\n\n===Kit suppliers and

Administered by the [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL), the team is nicknamed The Lions.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, the Great Britain team toured overseas, played against foreign touring teams and competed in the [[Rugby League World Cup]], which they won three times, in [[1954 Rugby League World Cup|1954]], [[1960 Rugby League World Cup|1960]] and [[1972 Rugby League World Cup|1972]].\n\nSince [[1995 Rugby League World Cup|1995]], the RFL has sent separate [[home nations]] teams to the World Cup. Great Britain continued to compete as a Test playing nation both home and away. They competed against Australia for [[The Ashes (rugby league)|the Ashes]], and [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] for the [[Baskerville Shield]], as well the [[Rugby League Tri-Nations|Tri-Nations]] series with both Australia and New Zealand. Great Britain also played in series and tours against [[France national rugby league team|France]], [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team|Papua New Guinea]] and [[Fiji national rugby league team|Fiji]].\n\nIn 2006, the RFL announced that after the [[2007 All Golds Tour]] the Great Britain team would no longer compete on a regular basis, and its players would represent [[England national rugby league team|England]], [[Wales national rugby league team|Wales]] and [[Scotland national rugby league team|Scotland]] at Test level.<ref name=RLSL>[http://www.sportinglife.com/rugbyleague/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=rleague/06/11/08/RUGBYL_Tri-Nations_Lewis.html Sporting Life]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210062109/http://www.sportinglife.com/rugbyleague/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=rleague%2F06%2F11%2F08%2FRUGBYL_Tri-Nations_Lewis.html |date=10 February 2012 }}</ref> It is planned that the Great Britain team will come together in future only for occasional tours, similar to the [[British and Irish Lions]] in [[rugby union]].\n\nOn 9 May 2017, it was confirmed that the [[2019 Great Britain Lions tour|Great Britain team would tour the southern hemisphere in 2019]] as the Great Britain Lions.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/39857448</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early years===\nInitially Great Britain were represented by a team made up of players from the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]], known simply as the \"Northern Union\" side. On 25 January 1908, the first ever Great Britain test match took place at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium]], [[Leeds]], versus New Zealand. At the time, Great Britain were referred to as the \"Northern Union\" \u2013 they won the game 14\u20136 before a crowd of 8,000. The second test went to [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] by 18\u20136, before 14,000 at [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], London. The third test was played at [[Cheltenham]], and 4,000 watched New Zealand win 8\u20135.\n\nThe first [[Australia national rugby league team|Kangaroos]] arrived in England on 27 September 1908, they toured Britain, losing more games than they won. They played their first ever test against the Northern Union in December at [[Loftus Road]], London; a last minute penalty against the Kangaroos for an obstruction play handed England a goal and a 22-all draw in front of a crowd of 2,000. The second test in [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in January 1909 attracted a crowd of 22,000, and the Northern Union won 15\u20135. The third test was played at [[Villa Park]], Birmingham, the Northern Union winning again 6\u20135 before a crowd of 9,000. The Australians suggested that the series should be named \"[[Rugby League Ashes|the Ashes]]\" after the cricket series of the same name.\n\n[[File:Touring squad of the 1910 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The first British touring team.]]The first British tour of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] began on 4 June 1910 captained by [[James Lomas (rugby league)|James Lomas]]. The Northern Union played [[New South Wales]] in front of 33,000 spectators in Sydney, losing 28\u201314. But they won the first test in Sydney against Australia 27\u201320 in front of 42,000 at the old Sydney Showground. They then won the second test in [[Brisbane]] 22\u201317. The tourists also recorded a 13-all draw against a combined Australasian side in front of over 42,000 at the Agricultural Ground. These tests have been credited as making [[rugby league]] the predominate code of [[rugby football]] in Australia, a situation which continues to this day. Upon arriving in [[Auckland]] on 17 July, the team was accorded a mayoral reception.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =\n  | first =\n  | author2 =\n  | title = Northern Union Team\n  | work = Poverty Bay Herald, Volume XXXVII, Issue 12201\n  | place = New Zealand\n  | page = 7\n  | language =\n  | publisher =\n  | date = 18 July 1910\n  | url = http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=PBH19100718.2.74\n  | accessdate = 3 December 2009}}</ref> On 30 July, they defeated New Zealand 52\u201320.\n\nThe second Lions tour down under in 1914, led by [[Harold Wagstaff]], became the stuff of legend. They played three Tests in eight days with the first two in three days. After sharing the first two tests, Great Britain finished with only 10 men due to injuries, but still managed to hang on for a 14\u20136 victory in Sydney in July 1914. It was dubbed \"[[Rorke's Drift test]]\", after a battle in the [[Anglo-Zulu War]].

They would not be lost again until 1950.\n\nThe 1924 Lions added the red and blue chevron to the all-white jersey.<ref name=\"Green & Gold\">{{cite web| url=http://www.rugbyleague.org/features/content.php?feat_id=196&featcat_id=32| title=Green & Gold makes its debut| publisher=Totalrl.com| author=Don Yates| accessdate=11 March 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727230216/http://www.rugbyleague.org/features/content.php?feat_id=196&featcat_id=32| archive-date=27 July 2011| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn the 1928 tour of [[Australasia]], Great Britain lost only five of 24 tour matches.

They were presented with the Ashes Trophy by the Australians, which the two countries have competed for ever since.\n\nGreat Britain then set off for [[New Zealand]], where they lost the first Test. On Saturday 18 August 1928 the Lions travelled to [[Tahuna Park]], [[Dunedin]], for the second Test. The Lions led 7\u20135 at the interval and went on to win 13\u20135. Seven days later the Lions won the third Test 6\u20135 to clinch the series two Tests to one. Before coming home they played some missionary games in [[Canada national rugby league team|Canada]], which led to the formation of a rugby league competition in that country.\n\nOn 5 October 1929, Australia won the first Test at [[The Boulevard (stadium)|the Boulevard]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] 31\u20138. Great Britain won the second 9\u20133 at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Headingley]], [[Leeds]] on 9 November 1929. The third test, held at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]], resulted in a 0\u20130 draw with Australia having a try disallowed in the last minute. With the series tied 1\u20131, an unprecedented fourth test was played at the [[Athletic Grounds, Greater Manchester|Athletic Grounds]], [[Rochdale]]. Britain won the test 3\u20130 to take the Ashes.\n\nBritain again won the Ashes in 1932. In 1932 the police locked the SCG gates after 70,204 crammed into the SCG. This would remain the world record test match attendance until eclipsed by the 73,631 who attended the [[1992 Rugby League World Cup Final|1992 World Cup Final]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1933 in Paris, England and Australia play the first game of rugby league in France. The match was one sided, with Australia winning 63\u201313 in front of a crowd of 5,000, but the seed was sown.\n\n[[Jim Sullivan (rugby league)|Jim Sullivan]] was asked to go again as captain of the 1936 tourists, but declined on the grounds of his wife's ill health. Britain again won the Ashes in 1936.\n\n===Post-war===\n\nThe 1946 Lions tour saw the team sail to Australia on [[HMS Indomitable (92)|HMS Indomitable]]. After a five-day train journey across Australia, [[Gus Risman]]'s team retained the Ashes, drawing the first Test and winning the other two Tests to become the only touring side to remain unbeaten on a tour of Australia.\n\nIn 1947, [[Roy Francis (rugby)|Roy Francis]] was the first of a long line of black players, to be capped by Great Britain.\n\nAustralia made their 7th tour to the UK in 1948, and this time play the Ashes series against a side officially called Great Britain. Great Britain win both games 16\u20137 and 23\u201321.\n\nIn 1950, the British Lions returned to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] soundly beating a full Western Australia team at Claremont Showground. In The Ashes series against [[Clive Churchill]]'s Australians, the 1950 touring side led by [[Bradford Bulls|Bradford Northern]]'s [[Ernest Ward]] had the unfortunate distinction of being the first England/Great Britain team to lose the Ashes since 1920. Great Britain won the opening game on an SCG mudheap 6-4, but lost the second test played on a dry track at the Brisbane Cricket Ground 15-3.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20140108011135/http://www.rlhalloffame.org.uk/presepic.htm] The third test win is still a record win against the Australians on their turf.\n\nIn 1958, Great Britain were defeated 23\u20139 by France at [[Stade Lesdigui\u00e8res]].\n\nDuring Australia's [[Kangaroo tour#1959/57 Kangaroo Tour|1959 Kangaroo Tour]] of Great Britain, Australia won the first Test 22\u201314 at [[Station Road, Swinton]].

Great Britain drew one and lost one of the fixtures: France won 20\u201318 at Stade Municipal, Toulouse. On 65 minutes a colossal brawl erupted when Georges Fages kicked [[Derek Turner]] on the chin following a tackle on Fages. When the dust settled Turner was ordered off, but five minutes elapsed before he was finally escorted from the field by [[Bill Fallowfield]], secretary of the [[Rugby Football League]]. There was 17\u201317 draw at [[Knowsley Road]], [[St Helens, Merseyside|St. Helens]].\n\nIn 1960, the World Cup was played on home soil. The tournament is decided on a league system but with both Great Britain and Australia undefeated, the last match became a virtual World Cup Final. [[Eric Ashton]] lifted the trophy after a 10\u20133 victory at [[Odsal Stadium|Odsal]] in front of a crowd of 32,733 and Britain played in an exhibition game in lieu of a decider.<ref name=\"RLWC\"/>\n\nIn December 1960, Great Britain beat France 21\u201310 at [[Stade Andr\u00e9 Moga]], Bordeaux, and in January 1961, they won again 27\u20138 at Knowsley Road, St Helens. New Zealand toured Great Britain in 1961. They won the first of the three matches 29\u201311 at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium]], [[Leeds]].\n\nEric Ashton was again captain of the 1962 Lions side and [[Colin Hutton]] was coach. The British Lions won the opening two Tests 31\u201312 and then 17\u201310, the first time in 34 years that they had won the first two matches on Australian soil. The first Test was played before more than 70,000 spectators. The third Test was staged at [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] on Saturday 14 July 1962. A controversial last-minute Australian try and the subsequent touchline conversion resulted in a 17\u201318 defeat; but for this, the 62 Lions would have been the first team to achieve a whitewash of the Australians.<ref name=\"Nil\"/>\n\nAfter crossing the [[Tasman Sea]] to New Zealand, they lost both Tests against New Zealand with a team depleted with injuries. The first Test 19\u20130, only the second time a British team had been held scoreless. In the second Test at [[Carlaw Park]], [[Auckland]] on Saturday 11 August 1962, several players had to play out of position and New Zealand won 27\u20138. Sixteen Lions visited South Africa on the way home and played three matches against South Africa. The second of those matches took place on Saturday 25 August in Durban, Great Britain won 39\u201333.\n\nIn 1962, Great Britain were defeated 17\u201312 by France at [[Stade Gilbert Brutus]], [[Perpignan]].\n\nIn 1963, Great Britain were defeated 2\u20131 in the Ashes series by the touring [[Kangaroo Tour|1963 Kangaroos]]. After the Aussies had won the first test 28\u20132 at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in front of only 13,946 fans, the second test was scheduled for [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]] in [[Municipal Borough of Swinton and Pendlebury|Swinton]]. In what became known as the \"Swinton Massacre\", the Kangaroos wrapped up the series with a 50\u201312 win over the Lions, including 3 tries by [[Ken Irvine]], 2 each to [[Reg Gasnier]] and [[Peter Dimond]], while [[Graeme Langlands]] scored two himself as well as kicking seven goals. The Lions avoided a series whitewash with a hard fought 16\u20135 win in the third test at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium]], [[Leeds]] which is regarded as one of the most brutal tests played between the two teams. Referee \"Sergeant Major\" [[Eric Clay]] was prominent when he sent off Lions blind-side prop (10) [[Cliff Watson]], as well as Australians [[Brian Hambly]] and [[Barry Muir]]. After giving Clay a few 'choice words' as he left the field, Muir later spoke to Clay claiming the English referee had robbed the Australians. According to Muir, Clay's response was ''\"Barry, I've got to live here.\"''\n\nGreat Britain beat France 12\u20130 in Avignon in 1964, they also won the return leg 10\u20130 in Leeds but were booed off the field.

The second Test was played at the old White City Stadium on Friday 3 November 1967, it was the only Test match ever to be played there. Australian tour manager Jack Drews appealed to the thousands of Australians living in London to support the tourists and was rewarded with a crowd of 17,445, many of them supporting Australia.

Great Britain won 22, drew one and lost one \u2013 making them the most successful British tourists to date.\n\nThe fifth [[Rugby League World Cup]] was held in England in November 1970. Britain were hot favourites, and won all three of their group stage games. All the other nations lost two games each, and Australia qualified for the final largely on the back of an impressive tally of points against New Zealand. The final was held at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium]], [[Leeds]]. Although Great Britain dominated the possession, the Kangaroos were able to exploit their chances, and ran out unexpected 12\u20137 winners in a scrappy, bad-tempered game that became known as \"The Battle of Leeds\".\n\nIn 1971 New Zealand wins a series in Britain for the first time, winning 17\u201314 in Castleford and 18\u201313 in Salford.\n[[Clive Sullivan]] had risen to the Great Britain captaincy, the first black captain of a home international side, and was in charge for the 1972 World Cup held in France. [[Jim Challinor]] was coach. Sullivan and Challinor led the under-rated Lions to victory over Australia (27\u201321), France (13\u20134) and New Zealand (53\u201319), claiming a try in each game. Clive scored a long distance try in the final in [[Stade Gerland]], [[Lyon]] as they drew with Australia 10\u201310 after extra time.<ref name=\"RLWC\"/> Great Britain won their third World Cup by virtue of having a better qualifying record. Sullivan was the last British captain to lift the World Cup.\n\nSaturday 24 November 1973.

British players had been playing under the \"six tackles\" rule for almost two years, but switched back to the old \"four tackles\" rule for international competition as the rule had not been changed in New Zealand. The Australian's won the first Ashes Test 12\u20136 at Lang Park, but bounced back to win the 2nd test at the Sydney Cricket Ground 16\u201311. The deciding test at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 20 July was won 22\u201318 by the home side.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/ashes-series-1974/summary.html 1974 Ashes series]</ref> In New Zealand, the Kiwis won the first Test 13\u20138. The second Test was staged at the Addington Showgrounds, Christchurch on Saturday 4 August 1974 and was won by Great Britain 17\u20138. Britain went on to win the third Test 20\u20130 to clinch the series.\n\nGreat Britain did not compete in the 1975 World Cup as the UK was represented by teams from England and Wales for the first time in a World Cup.\n\nOn 6 July 1975, at Boroko, [[Papua New Guinea Kumuls|Papua New Guinea]] played their first ever international. They were beaten 40\u201312 by Great Britain.\n\nThere was a reappearance for the Great Britain team at the [[1977 Rugby League World Cup|1977 World Cup]] in Australasia under coach [[David Watkins (rugby)|David Watkins]]. Australia topped the table and Great Britain were the underdogs going to the [[1977 Rugby League World Cup Final|Final]], held at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]]. They managed to dominate the possession, and it took a last minute try from Australia's [[John Kolc]] to win the Cup 13\u201312 in front of 24,457 spectators.\n\nThe [[The Ashes (rugby league)|1978 Ashes series]] were won by the touring Australians, but Great Britain, labelled a Dads' Army team thanks to their front row with both props ([[Jim Mills (rugby league)|Jim Mills]] and [[Brian Lockwood]]) and hooker ([[Tony Fisher (rugby)|Tony Fisher]]) all being over 30 years of age, beat the Kangaroos in the second test 18\u201314, at [[Bradford]]'s [[Odsal Stadium]], before a crowd of 26,447. It was to be 10 years, and 15 consecutive test defeats before Britain beat the Kangaroos again. [[Peter Fox (rugby league, born 1933)|Peter Fox]] was the coach.\n\nThe tour of Australasia in 1979 was a disastrous one in many ways. A number of players withdrew because of injury, and coach [[Eric Ashton]] was unable to fly out with his squad because his daughter had been involved in a car crash. Injuries during the tour caused three influential players to return home early, whilst attendance figures at tour matches were disappointing due to the lacklustre performances of the tourists, and led to a financial loss of over \u00a3300,000 on the trip. The Australian's, coached by [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]] and captained by [[George Peponis]], won the series 3\u20130. Australian centre [[Michael Cronin (rugby league)|Michael Cronin]] scored a total of 54 points for the series with two tries and 24 goals. Incredibly he outscored the Lions who only scored 18 points for the entire series, losing the first test 35\u20130 in Brisbane, and the second and third tests 24\u201316 and 28\u20132 in Sydney. Total attendance for the series was just 66,752 compared to the 133,791 who saw the three tests on the 1974 Lions tour. Critics from both Britain and Australia called the team the weakest and least committed touring side ever to tour Australia and that poor results had been the cause of such a dramatic drop in attendances.\n\nThe first Test at Lang Park in Brisbane was staged on Saturday 16 June 1979, and attracted a healthy crowd of 23,051, although it was actually the lowest for an Anglo-Australian Test in Australia for over sixty years. After a string of encouraging results in the opening matches; Britain were confident of pulling off an upset. However the Lions, 16\u20130 down at half-time, crashed to a 35\u20130 defeat, the heaviest Britain had suffered in a Test played in Australia.<ref name=\"Long\"/> The tour's largest attendance came in the second test at the SCG with 26,857. But the third test could only draw 16,844 to the SCG, at the time the lowest ever attendance in Australia for an Anglo-Australian test.\n\n===1980s===\n\n[[Johnny Whiteley]] became coach again in 1980 until 1982. He achieved a drawn series against New Zealand in [[1980 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France|1980]], but was given a tougher time by the touring Australians.\n\nRugby league was taken into a new dimension by the 1982 Kangaroos side. The '[[The Invincibles (Rugby League)|Invincibles]]' became the first team to win every game of the tour (15 games) including the first test by 40\u20134 at Hull in front of 26,771 spectators at [[Boothferry Park]]. The Kangaroos only led 10\u20134 at half time, but unleashed a second half onslaught that left the British game stunned. Coached by [[Frank Stanton (rugby league)|Frank Stanton]] and captained by [[Max Krilich]], the Kangaroos included veterans such as [[Craig Young]], [[Steve Rogers (rugby league)|Steve Rogers]], [[Kerry Boustead]], the fiery [[Les Boyd]], [[Rod Reddy]] and [[Ray Price (rugby)|Ray Price]], as well as a crop of young players on their way to superstar status in rugby league including [[Mal Meninga]], tour vice-captain [[Wally Lewis]], [[Brett Kenny]], [[Peter Sterling (rugby league commentator)|Peter Sterling]], [[Eric Grothe Sr.|Eric Grothe]] and [[Wayne Pearce]]. The second test in Wigan ended 27\u20136 to the visitors. During the second half of that game, Kangaroos replacement Wally Lewis fired a bullet like 20 metre pass for Meninga to score in the corner. Soundly thrashed to that point of the series, the play did psychological damage to the Lions who were left wondering just how good the Australians really were if someone who could pass like Lewis couldn't even make the starting XIII. The third test was held at [[Headingley Rugby Stadium|Headingley]], [[Leeds]] which ended 32\u20138, though the game was in the balance until the final ten minutes when the Kangaroos superior fitness told and they ran in four late tries. The Lions scored their only try of the series in the second half at Headingley when Hull winger [[Steve Evans (rugby league)|Steve Evans]] scored. This was the beginning of an era of Australian dominance.\n\n[[Frank Myler]] took over as coach following the Invincibles tour. Great Britain toured Australia in 1984 and both [[Garry Schofield]] and [[Ellery Hanley]] made their test d\u00e9buts, with 18 year old Schofield in particular earning praise from the Australian's with his attacking displays in the centres (Hanley, better known later in his career as a lock forward or five-eighth, played on the wing for each test of the series). After losing the first two Tests, Britain was expected to capitulate completely in the third Test, which was staged at Sydney Cricket Ground on Saturday 7 July 1984.<ref name=\"Oz\">{{cite web | url= http://www.totalrl.com/onthisday/index.php?feat_id=205 | archive-url= https://archive.is/20070607074641/http://www.totalrl.com/onthisday/index.php?feat_id=205 | url-status= dead | archive-date= 7 June 2007 | title=Aussies whitewash '84 Lions | publisher=Totalrl.com | author=Don Yates | accessdate=11 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Lions then moved on to New Zealand where the Kiwis won the first two Tests in Auckland and Christchurch and the Lions faced the prospect of losing each match of a three-Test series against the Kiwis for the first time. On Saturday 28 July 1984, the Third Test was held at Carlaw Park, Auckland. The Lions started well and went into a 16\u20138 lead in the second half before New Zealand recovered to score 24 points in the last 25 minutes and win 32\u201316. It was the first time they had scored over 30 points in a Test match against Great Britain.\n\n[[Maurice Bamford]] took over as coach in 1984. His term as coach of the national side also included the formation of the Great Britain under-21 team to replace the U/24 side. The ninth [[Rugby League World Cup]] was played out between [[1985-88 Rugby League World Cup|1985 and 1988]], with teams playing each other on a home and away basis. These matches were fitted into the normal international programme of three-match test series between the nations, with a pre-designated match from each series counting as the world cup fixture.\n\nIn 1985, Garry Schofield re-wrote the record books by scoring four tries as Great Britain beat New Zealand in a test series at Central Park, Wigan. [[Shaun Edwards]] made his debut for Great Britain against France in 1985 at Headingley. Britain went on to beat France 50\u20134, a record score.\n\nIn 1986 a then record northern hemisphere crowd of 50,383 attends the first test of the Ashes series at [[Old Trafford (football)|Old Trafford]]. The Australians won 38\u201316, continuing their dominance of The Lions. The [[1986 Kangaroo tour|1986 Kangaroos]], who like their 1982 counterparts (and included 5 players from \"The Invincibles\" \u2013 Wally Lewis (captain), Peter Sterling (vice-captain), Mal Meninga, Brett Kenny and [[Gene Miles]]) went through Great Britain and France undefeated and earned the nickname \"The Unbeatables\". The second test at [[Elland Road]] in Leeds was a disaster for the Lions with the Kangaroos leading 34-0 late in the match before winning 34-4 after Schofield scored a late consolation try. Australia completed the series sweep when they won the third test at Wigan 24-15 after a much improved performance by Maurice Bamford's men.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/ashes-series-1986/summary.html 1986 Ashes series at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\n[[Mal Reilly]] was appointed Head Coach in 1987 and opened with six wins, four against France and two over Papua New Guinea. In 1987, Ellery Hanley was appointed Great Britain captain and on the [[1988 Great Britain Lions tour|1988 tour]] down under took the Lions the closest they had been for a decade to regaining the Ashes. On 9 July 1988, Great Britain beat Australia 26\u201312 in Sydney to win the 3rd test, though the series had already been lost. This was the first British victory over Australia since their 18\u201314 win at the Odsal Stadium in Bradford on 5 November 1978. The third test also saw the smallest Anglo-Australian test attendance in Australia when only 15,944 attended the [[dead rubber]] game at the new [[Sydney Football Stadium]]. The first test played on 11 June and won 17\u20136 by Australia in front of 24,480 at the Sydney Football Stadium, was the 100th Anglo-Australian test match.\n\nDuring that 1988 tour, the Lions suffered two embarrassing losses in the lead up to the first test against Australia. The Lions lost 36\u201312 to a Northern Division (NSW) representative team in [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] in what was called \"Black Sunday\". According to reports, after the game Mal Reilly locked his team in the change room and upbraided them for 20 minutes before allowing the media in.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McGregor|first1=Adrian|title=Simply The Best: The 1990 Kangaroos|date=1991|publisher=University of Queensland Press|location=Qld|isbn=0 7022 2370 0|page=55 The Fall and Rise of England}}</ref> But worse was to come just 2 days later when they lost 30\u20130 to reigning [[1987 NSWRL season|Sydney premiers]] [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah]] only 4 days out from the test. The Manly team that night, missing 7 regular players (including 4 Australian test players), were coached by Mal Reilly's [[1972 NSWRFL season|1972]] and [[1973 NSWRFL season|1973]] Sydney premiership winning teammate [[Bob Fulton]] who would become the Australian coach in 1989 and spend almost a decade tormenting the Lions.\n\nThe final group stage match of the 1985/88 World Cup qualifier between New Zealand and Great Britain became a sudden death battle for a spot in the final, Britain only needed a draw. In the event the Kiwis came through 12\u201310, and went on to lose to Australia in the [[1988 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] at [[Eden Park]], [[Auckland]].\n\nThe tenth [[Rugby League World Cup]] followed a similar format covering the years [[1989-92 Rugby League World Cup|1989 and 1992]]. In 1989 Great Britain won their first home series since 1965, beating New Zealand by two tests to one. With France and Papua New Guinea not being competitive, it became a straight fight between Britain and the Kiwis for the right to meet the Kangaroos in the final. In the event the Lions were able to just edge out the Kiwis on points difference.\n\n===1990s: Super League War===\nFrance gained their first win in 23 years across the Channel in 1990 when they won 25\u201318 at Headingley.\n\nIn 1990, Great Britain made their first full-scale tour of Papua New Guinea. A combination of soaring temperatures, altitude and the atmosphere created by over 11,500 Papua New Guinea fans, many clinging to trees outside the tiny, ramshackle ground in [[Goroka]], unnerved the tourists. Papua New Guinea beat Great Britain 20\u201318, the Lions' one and only loss to the Kumuls. This saw the series tied 1\u20131.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/papua-new-guinea-vs-great-britain-1990/summary.html 1990 PNG vs GB at Rugby League Project]</ref> Great Britain then won a series 2\u20131 in New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/new-zealand-vs-great-britain-1990/summary.html 1990 NZ vs GB at Rugby League Project]</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1990 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and France|1990 Ashes series]], Great Britain defeated Australia 19\u201312 in the first test at Wembley on Saturday 27 October 1990 in front of a new record home crowd of 54,567. It was the first time that an Australian team had been beaten in Britain for twelve years and 37 matches.<ref name=\"Aussies defeated\">{{cite web|url=http://www.totalrl.com/onthisday/index.php?feat_id=270 |title=When Britain defeated the Aussies |publisher=Totalrl.com |author=Don Yates |date= |accessdate=11 March 2008 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Australia made eight changes for the second Test, held at Old Trafford on Saturday 10 November 1990. With the scores tied at 10\u201310, with twenty seconds to go, Kangaroos halfback [[Ricky Stuart]] raced 70 metres before slipping the ball to Mal Meninga who dived over to give the Kangaroos a 14\u201310 victory. The third Test was won by Australia 14\u20130 to complete a 2\u20131 series win.<ref name=\"TV game\"/>\n\nDuring the [[1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand|1992 tour of Australia and New Zealand]], Great Britain lost the first [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes]] test 22\u20136 in Sydney. Two weeks later, led by [[Garry Schofield]] and with a pack made up entirely of Wigan players, Great Britain grabbed a memorable 33\u201310 win in Melbourne on a night where the weather and (neutral) [[Princes Park (stadium)|ground]] was more like a winters night in northern England than 'sunny' Australia.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epT4-ZaHBlw&t=3s Australia v Great Britain (10-33) - 1992 Rugby League 2nd Ashes Test]</ref> However, back in familiar territory, Australia won the third test 16\u201310 in Brisbane.\n\nThe [[1989-92 Rugby League World Cup]] was played out over three-years, the Great Britain side squeezed into the final on goal difference ahead of New Zealand. The [[1992 Rugby League World Cup Final|World Cup Final]] at Wembley set a world record attendance for a rugby league international: 73,631 saw Australia edge Great Britain 10\u20136 with the only try coming from [[Steve Renouf]] late in the game. This figure beat the previous record of 70,204 set at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] during the [[1932 Ashes series]].<ref name=\"RLWC\"/> The attendance figure at Wembley would remain the largest for an international until 74,468 saw the Kangaroos defeat New Zealand 34\u20132 in the [[2013 Rugby League World Cup Final|2013 World Cup Final]] at Old Trafford. The 1992 Final was set to be played in Australia due to the Kangaroos finishing unbeaten at the top of the table. However, with the prospect of a 70,000+ attendance at Wembley on offer, the [[Australian Rugby League]] consented to the game being held in London.<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/world-cup-1989-92/summary.html 1989-1992 Rugby League World Cup]</ref>\n\nGreat Britain won the 1993 home series against New Zealand by three tests to nil, including a 17\u20130 victory at Wembley in the first test. During the second test in Wigan, Lions and Wigan winger [[Martin Offiah]]'s reputation as the fastest player in the game, which had taken a big hit when he was defeated in a 100-metre match race with [[Parramatta Eels]] (Australia) flyer [[Lee Oudenryn]] during the 1992 Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, was further dented when he made a break and despite having a 3-metre start, was run down from behind and unceremoniously bundled into touch by Kiwi and Leeds centre [[Kevin Iro]].\n\n[[Mal Reilly]] stood down as Great Britain coach in 1994. [[Ellery Hanley]] was appointed coach of the Great Britain national rugby league team for the Ashes series of 1994, which was held in Great Britain. The [[1994 Kangaroo tour]] was the last played in the conventional format, where the Australian side plays a number of matches against British club and provincial outfits, in addition to the Test matches. Great Britain won the first test 8\u20134 at Wembley after playing most of the game without captain Shaun Edwards who was sent off in the first half for a high tackle on [[Bradley Clyde]]. Without Edwards (suspended) and Wembley man of the match, fullback [[Jonathan Davies (rugby player born 1962)|Jonathan Davies]] who had dislocated his shoulder late in the first test, the Lions lost the second test 38\u20138 at Old Trafford. Edwards returned for the third test which was won 23\u20134 by Australia at [[Elland Road]].<ref>[http://www.rugbyleagueproject.org/competitions/ashes-series-1994/summary.html 1994 Ashes series]</ref>\n\nIn 1996 Great Britain embarked on a disastrous tour of the Southern Hemisphere under coach [[Phil Larder]]. They did not play Australia because of the [[Super League War]], but played and won their first and so far only test against [[Fiji national rugby league team|Fiji]], before losing a series 3\u20130 to New Zealand. Several British players had to be sent home early because the tour ran out of money.\n\n[[Andy Goodway]] was appointed Great Britain coach in 1997. At the end of that year Great Britain played a home [[Super League Test series|three-Test series]] against the [[Australian Super League]] and lost 2\u20131. Despite the series being given official test status, these games are not widely regarded as a genuine Ashes series because so many Australian stars were again missing. The continuing Super League war meant that the 1998 Kangaroo Tour was cancelled.\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Super League war]] meant that the next [[Kangaroo tour]], set for 1998, never eventuated.\n\nWith the Super League War finally over in 1999, Great Britain travelled to the Southern Hemisphere for the first Tri-Nations tournament with Australia and New Zealand. Great Britain struggled to overcome Burleigh Bears in a warm-up match, went on to suffer humiliating defeats by world champions Australia and New Zealand, and then struggled to beat the New Zealand Maoris. A huge gap has opened up once again between the northern and southern hemispheres. In January 2000, Andy Goodway quit as Great Britain coach with a year left on his contract [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20000116/ai_n9705732].\n\n===2000-2007: Record defeats and whitewashes===\nIn February 2001, Australian [[David Waite]] was appointed full-time head coach and technical director ahead of the Ashes series. The Australians arrived in Britain for the first Ashes series since 1994. Great Britain surprised everyone by winning the first test, but lost the next two.\n\nIn July 2002 Great Britain suffered a record test defeat 64\u201310 to Australia in Sydney.\n\nIn November 2003 Great Britain lost an Ashes series 0\u20133 on home soil, having led all three matches with less than five minutes to play. This was considered one of the most humiliating defeats in Great Britain Test history, as with injuries and pullouts, Australia had sent a virtually third-choice side to Great Britain. Great Britain was heavily favoured to win the Ashes, but lost each Test. Waite stepped down from his role.\n\nIn 2004, [[Brian Noble (rugby league)|Brian Noble]] was appointed part-time coach. The '...and Ireland' was dropped from the team name as they reverted to 'Great Britain'. The Lions beat Australia in a tournament for the first time in 31 years when they won the league phase of the [[2004 rugby league tri-nations]] with the most points, only to be comprehensively beaten 44\u20134 in the final by Australia.\n\nIn the [[2005 rugby league tri-nations|2005 Tri Nations]], Great Britain only won one game. This came against eventual tournament winners [[New Zealand national rugby league team|the Kiwis]] by over twenty points and dominated the entire match. However, the Kiwis posted their highest score ever against Great Britain in London. Great Britain did not make the final of the tournament.\n\nOn 4 November 2006, Great Britain beat Australia 23\u201312 in Sydney for the first time since 1988 [http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,20702569-23214,00.html]. However, they lost the other three games and went down to a record defeat against New Zealand. They failed to make the final of the tournament for the second year in succession.\n\nAt the end of the 2006 season Brian Noble's contract as Head Coach ran out and was not renewed. It was believed that the RFL were looking for a full-time Head Coach and Brian Noble wasn't willing to surrender his role as [[Wigan Warriors]] Head Coach. In March 2007, Leeds coach, Tony Smith was installed as coach.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/6494011.stm] His first game in charge of Great Britain was the victory over France. The 3\u20130 whitewash of New Zealand followed starting with a 20\u201314 victory at Huddersfield, a 44\u20130 thrashing of the Kiwis in the 2nd test at Hull and a final test win at the JJB by 28 points to 22.\n\n[[File:Great Britain - New Zealand rugby league test, 2007.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The final home Test for Great Britain against New Zealand in 2007.]]In 2007, Great Britain enjoyed a three nil series whitewash of the touring New Zealand side in the [[2007 All Golds tour]].\n\n===2008-2019: Hiatus===\nAfter the [[2007 All Golds tour]] Great Britain was retired with the focus being more on strengthening the other three home nations.\n\nA 2015 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia was approved by the [[RLIF]] however the [[Australian national rugby league team|Australians]] wanted to have a year off before the [[Rugby League Four Nations|2016 Four Nations]].\n\nIn 2016 it was rumoured the Australians want to have a Kangaroos tour of the UK against Great Britain.\n\n===2019 return===\nIn May 2017, it was confirmed that Great Britain would tour the southern hemisphere in 2019, with New Zealand and Australia touring Europe in 2018 and 2020 respectively.\n\nGreat Britain's 2019 began with a 14-6 loss against Tonga.  They would go on to lose their following three tour matches against New Zealand and suffered a humiliating loss to Papua New Guinea.  After the tour had concluded, several of the Great Britain players and head coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]] came under intense media scrutiny and fan backlash.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/rugby-league/49830997/|title=PNG 28-10 Great Britain|website=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/21/wayne-bennett-new-contract-rfl-ralph-rimmer/|title=Wayne Bennett could earn new England contract despite disastrous Lions tour|website=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/rugby-league-news-updates-live-3545618/|title=Rugby League news: Reaction to Great Britain horror show, Hull FC class of 2013, KR's Adam Quinlan motivated|website=Hull Daily Mail}}</ref>\n\n== Team image ==\n===Kit===\n{|\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_thinredhoops|pattern_b=_donbosco|pattern_ra=_thinredhoops|pattern_so=_2 white stripes|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=000000|socks=FF0000|title=1907\u20131920}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_GBR1|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=FFFFFF|title=1921\u20131984}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_GBR1|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_band_red|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=FFFFFF|socks=0000CD|title=1957\u20131972}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_GBR1985|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_band_red|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=0000FF|title=1985\u20131989}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_GBR1990a|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=_band_red|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=0000FF|title=1990\u20131991}}\n|}\n\n{|\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=|pattern_b=_GBR1992|pattern_ra=|pattern_so=|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=0000FF|title=1992}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_blueborder|pattern_b=_GBR1993|pattern_ra=_blueborder|pattern_so=_bluehorizontal|pattern_sh=_GBR1993|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=FFFFFF|title=1993}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_redborder|pattern_b=_GBR1994a|pattern_ra=_redborder|pattern_so=_band_red|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=0000FF|title=1994}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_bluelower|pattern_b=_GBR1997|pattern_ra=_redlower|pattern_so=_GBR1997|pattern_sh=|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=0000FF|title=1997\u20131999}}\n|{{Football kit box|pattern_la=_GBRL|pattern_b=_GBRL|pattern_ra=_blue_stripes2|pattern_so=_GBR1997|pattern_sh=_red_stripes2|leftarm=FFFFFF|body=FFFFFF|rightarm=FFFFFF|shorts=0000FF|socks=FFFFFF|title=Primary}}\n|}\n[[File:Great Britain rugby league crest.png|right|150px]]\n\nThe team was originally known as the ''[[Rugby Football League|Northern Union]] XIII'' in reference to the name of the sport's governing body. After 1922 the name ''the Lions'' was first used. In 1948 the team became known as ''Great Britain'' for the [[The Ashes (rugby league)|Ashes Series]]. During the 1990s the Rugby Football League expanded this to ''Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', and the jersey bore the name ''British Isles XIII''. In 2004 the words \"''...and Northern Ireland''\" were dropped from the title, though the Irish shamrock continued to form part of the RFL's [[Heraldry|crest]] and ''British Isles XIII'' remained on the jersey. At matches, the team was represented by the [[Flag of the United Kingdom|Union Flag]] and the singing of [[God Save the Queen]], both symbols of the United Kingdom. The practice of a UK-wide team being called ''Great Britain'' has a precedent with the Great British Olympic team, though the formal name of the Olympic team includes \"and Northern Ireland\". The team continued to compete until the [[2007 All Golds Tour]]: henceforth, the Great Britain team will now be reserved for Lions tours of the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. According to Richard Lewis, chairman of the Rugby Football League:\n\n:\"It will bring consistency. What I am passionate about is the international game being consistent. To me, it has always been illogical that we play as Great Britain for three or four years, and when the World Cup comes along, suddenly we become England. In the major competitions, which will be most years, we will play as England. That will also allow Scotland and Wales to develop. We have then floated the concept of Great Britain to tour in 2010. It would be a tour as opposed to playing a formal competition, and I wouldn't restrict that to just Australia and New Zealand.\"<ref>[http://sport.guardian.co.uk/rugbyleague/story/0,10069,1656696,00.html England to take pride of place over Britain] The Guardian, 3 December 2005</ref>\n\n===Kit suppliers and

He started his career as an elected official on the [[New York City Council]], representing the 39th district in [[Brooklyn]] from 2002 to 2009.

In his first term, he implemented free universal [[Pre-kindergarten|Pre-K]] in the city. De Blasio has called attention to what he calls stark economic inequality in New York City, which he described as a \"[[A Tale of Two Cities|tale of two cities]]\" during his first campaign. He has supported [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] and [[Progressive Era|progressive]] policies in regard to [[Economy of New York City|the city's economy]], urban planning, public education, police relations, and [[privatization]].\n\nDe Blasio [[Bill de Blasio 2020 presidential campaign|ran]] in the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic primaries]] for the [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 presidential election]].

The facial profile may be concave or straight; the ears are upright.{{r|cabi|page=399}} The average weight is approximately {{convert|35|kg|lb|abbr=on|round=5}}, while maximum height is about {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} for males and slightly less for females;{{r|cabi|page=399}} stock bred for dairy performance may be rather larger than show or companion animals.{{r|albc}}\n\nIt is a [[precocial|precocious]] breed \u2013 young stock may be [[livestock breeding|bred]] from an early age: males from about three months, females from seven or eight months.{{r|bz}} The [[gestation period]] is in the range 145\u2013153 days;{{r|bz}} the twinning rate is high, and triplet and quadruplet births are not uncommon.{{r|cabi|page=399|albc}} [[Life expectancy]] is from 8\u201312 years.{{r|bz}}\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Nigerdwarfgoat.jpg|thumb|Nigerian Dwarf twins]]\nThe Nigerian Dwarf was originally [[selective breeding|bred]] for [[animal show|show]] and as a [[companion animal]].

Coyotes (Canis Latrans) are the main predators of goats and if not caged or fenced in correctly the goats will be eaten. One way to protect the Nigerian Dwarf Goat is to purchase a Donkey (Equus Asinus) which will scare away predators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/ewdcc4/43/|title=Use Of Donkeys To Guard Sheep And Goats In Texas|last=Murray|first=Walton|date=September 1989|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{commons|Nigerian Dwarf Goat}}\n{{reflist|45em|refs=\n\n<ref name=albc>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100307014641/http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/nigerian.html Nigerian Dwarf Goat].

The facial profile may be concave or straight; the ears are upright.{{r|cabi|page=399}} The average weight is approximately {{convert|35|kg|lb|abbr=on|round=5}}, while maximum height is about {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} for males and slightly less for females;{{r|cabi|page=399}} stock bred for dairy performance may be rather larger than show or companion animals.{{r|albc}}\n\nIt is a [[precocial|precocious]] breed \u2013 young stock may be [[livestock breeding|bred]] from an early age: males from about three months, females from seven or eight months.{{r|bz}} The [[gestation period]] is in the range 145\u2013153 days;{{r|bz}} the [[twinning rate]] is high, and triplet and quadruplet births are not uncommon.{{r|cabi|page=399|albc}} [[Life expectancy]] is from 8\u201312 years.{{r|bz}}\n\n== Use ==\n[[File:Nigerdwarfgoat.jpg|thumb|Nigerian Dwarf twins]]\nThe Nigerian Dwarf was originally [[selective breeding|bred]] for [[animal show|show]] and as a [[companion animal]]. It was later also bred for [[dairy]] use.{{r|albc}} Average [[goat's milk|milk]] yield of dairy stock is {{convert|340|kg|lb|abbr=on|-1}} per year;{{r|sandy|page=284}} the highest recorded annual yield is {{convert|782|kg|lb|abbr=on|-1|comma=off}} in a [[lactation]] of 305 days.{{r|sandy|page=277}} Lactation usually lasts for about ten months.{{r|albc}} The milk is high in [[butterfat]] and [[protein]], averaging 6.5% and 3.9% respectively,{{r|sandy|page=284}} and is suitable for making cheese and butter.{{r|albc}}\n\n== Protection ==\nWhen the Nigerian Dwarf is being tamed as a pet it also needs protection from predators. Coyotes (Canis Latrans) are the main predators of goats and if not caged or fenced in correctly the goats will be eaten. One way to protect the Nigerian Dwarf Goat is to purchase a Donkey (Equus Asinus) which will scare away predators.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/ewdcc4/43/|title=Use Of Donkeys To Guard Sheep And Goats In Texas|last=Murray|first=Walton|date=September 1989|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{commons|Nigerian Dwarf Goat}}\n{{reflist|45em|refs=\n\n<ref name=albc>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100307014641/http://www.albc-usa.org/cpl/nigerian.html Nigerian Dwarf Goat].

The [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railway]] was built in 1856 and caused the settlement to be relocated near the tracks, in its present location. It was incorporated as the village of Watford in 1873. Watford was either named for the [[Watford]] in England, or by Col. Brown for his home town of [[Watford, Ireland]].\n\nThere was a great fire in the 1880s that destroyed much of the town during a [[Guy Fawkes Night]] celebration.\n\nIn 1972, Watford Roof Truss started manufacturing wood trusses for delivery in the Southwestern Ontario and Southern Michigan markets. Watford Roof Truss is still a major employer in the town.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Canada census\n |2016_population=3,692 | 2016_pop_delta=-0.7 | 2016_land_area=290.20

Watford Roof Truss is still a major employer in the town.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Canada census\n |2016_population=3,692 | 2016_pop_delta=-0.7 | 2016_land_area=290.20 | 2016_pop_density=12.7\n |2016_median_age=40.8 | 2016_median_age_m=40.1 | 2016_median_age_f=41.3\n |2016_total_pvt_dwell=1,432 | 2016_mean_hh_income=72,277 | 2016_access_date=2019-06-17\n |2011_population=3,717 | 2011_pop_delta=-5.8 | 2011_land_area=290.20 | 2011_pop_density=12.8\n |2011_median_age=40.7 | 2011_median_age_m=39.9 | 2011_median_age_f=41.7\n |2011_total_pvt_dwell=1,434 | 2011_mean_hh_income= | 2011_access_date=2012-08-08\n |2006_population=3,945 | 2006_pop_delta=-2.0 | 2006_land_area=290.20 | 2006_pop_density=13.6\n |2006_median_age=37.6 | 2006_median_age_m=35.8 | 2006_median_age_f=39.4 \n |2006_total_pvt_dwell=1,425 | 2006_mean_hh_income=57,383 | 2006_access_date=2011-02-22\n |2001_population=4,025 | 2001_pop_delta=-1.7 | 2001_land_area=290.20 | 2001_pop_density=13.9\n |2001_median_age=35.9 | 2001_median_age_m=34.7 | 2001_median_age_f=36.9\n |2001_total_pvt_dwell=1,443 | 2001_mean_hh_income=50,447 | 2001_access_date=2011-02-22\n}}\n[[File:Warwick ON 2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Municipal office]]\n\n{{Historical populations\n|align=centre\n|footnote=<ref>Statistics Canada: [[Canada 1996 Census|1996]], [[Canada 2001 Census|2001]], [[Canada 2006 Census|2006]] census</ref><ref name=\"REFA\"/><ref name=\"census2016\"/>\n|[[Canada 1996 Census|1996]]| 4141\n|[[Canada 2001 Census|2001]]| 4025\n|[[Canada 2006 Census|2006]]| 3945\n|[[Canada 2011 Census|2011]]| 3717\n|[[Canada 2016 Census|2016]]| 3692\n}}\n\nPopulations prior to amalgamation (2001):\n* Population total in 1996: 4,141\n** Warwick (township): 2,481\n** Watford (village): 1,660\n* Population in 1991: \n** Warwick (township): 2,519\n** Watford (village): 1,524\n\n==Township council==\nThe township's current mayor is Jackie Rombouts, and its councillors are Jerry Westgate, Wayne Morris, Todd White and Colin Mitchell.<ref>{{cite web |title=Council |url=https://www.warwicktownship.ca/en/our-government/council.aspx |publisher=Township of Warwick |accessdate=June 17, 2019}}</ref>  They were elected in 2018 and their term will end in 2022, in conjunction with province-wide municipal elections in Ontario.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of townships in Ontario]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"REFA\">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3538043&Geo2=CD&Code2=3538&Data=Count&SearchText=Warwick&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |title=Warwick census profile |publisher=Statistics Canada |work=[[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census of Population]] |accessdate=2012-08-08}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Spoken Wikipedia|en-watford_ontario.ogg|2006-01-14}}\n* {{Commons category-inline}}\n* [http://www.warwicktownship.ca/ Township of Warwick]\n\n{{Geographic location\n | Centre    = Warwick\n | North     = [[Lambton Shores]]\n | Northeast = [[North Middlesex, Ontario|North Middlesex]]\n | East      = [[Adelaide Metcalfe]]\n | Southeast = \n | South     = [[Brooke-Alvinston]]\n | Southwest = [[Enniskillen, Ontario|Enniskillen]]\n | West      = [[Plympton\u2013Wyoming]]\n | Northwest = \n}}\n\n[[Category:Lower-tier municipalities in Ontario]]\n[[Category:Municipalities in Lambton County]]\n[[Category:Township municipalities in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "1980fast", "label": "safe", "comment": "Punctuation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwick,_Ontario"}
