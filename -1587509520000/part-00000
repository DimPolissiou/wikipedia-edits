The [[North Vietnam]]ese army ([[PAVN]]) launched the [[1975 Spring Offensive|Spring Offensive]] in March, the [[South Vietnam]]ese army ([[ARVN]]) was quickly defeated.  The [[communist]] North Vietnamese captured [[Saigon]] on April 30, accepting the surrender of South Vietnam. In the final days of the war, the United States, which had supported South Vietnam for many years, carried out an emergency evacuation of its civilian and military personnel and more than 130,000 Vietnamese.\n\nAt the beginning of the Spring Offensive the balance of forces in Vietnam was approximately as follows; North Vietnam: 305,000 soldiers, 600 armored vehicles, and 490 heavy artillery pieces in South Vietnam and South Vietnam: 1.0 million soldiers,<ref>Dougan, Clark and Fulghum, David (1985), ''The Fall of the South'', Boston: Boston Publishing Company, p. 26. The total for South Vietnam includes an undetermined number of \"ghost soldiers\"--who existed only on paper.</ref> 1,200 to 1,400 tanks, and more than 1,000 pieces of heavy artillery.<ref>Isaacs, Arnold R.

All but 850 of 5,400 South Vietnamese soldiers defending the province were killed or captured. The lack of a military response by the US to the loss of a province persuaded North Vietnam that it could take more aggressive actions.<ref>Isaacs, pp. 332\u2013333</ref>\n\n; 8 January\nDelegates to a [[Politburo]] conference in North Vietnam agreed that the US was not going to intervene militarily in South Vietnam and therefore North Vietnam had the opportunity to \"destroy and disintegrate\" the South Vietnamese army.<ref>Le Gro, Col.

The only route open to many of the retreating ARVN forces was Route 7B, a highway in poor repair.  As most senior officers of the army had departed the highlands by helicopter, many of the remaining soldiers were a leaderless mob mixed with fleeing civilians. In the \"convoy of tears\", under fire by the North Vietnamese, only about 60,000 of 180,000 fleeing civilians were known to have reached the coast and temporary safety.  Only 900 of 7,000 South Vietnamese rangers, who provided most of the defense of the convoy, and 5,000 of 20,000 other Vietnamese soldiers are known to have survived.

However, there were still about 420 Vietnamese and other non-Americans left inside the Embassy compound. Two additional helicopters were dispatched with the pilots instructed by President Ford that only Americans were to be evacuated. Ambassador Martin and his staff were to board the first of the helicopters and the remaining American staff were to leave on the second helicopter. Additional helicopters were then sent to evacuate the Marine guards, under the command of Major James Kean, with the last eleven leaving the Embassy at 0753 hours.

It was altered in 2006 to resemble the town's arms more closely, including the [[Latin]] motto ''Animo et Fide'', which loosely translated, means ''With Courage and Faith''.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\">{{cite web | url=http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | title=Stockport \u2013 Explanation of the Arms of Stockport | publisher=manchester2002-uk.com | accessdate=29 August 2015 | last=Moss | first=John | date=28 April 2009 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122022349/http://www.manchester2002-uk.com/towns/stockport3.html | archive-date=22 November 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The blue shield is taken from the coat of arms of the 'de Stokeport' family, from whom Stockport derives its name.<ref name=\"Stockport - Explanation of the Arms of Stockport\" /><ref name=\"Secret Stockport\" /> The twin-towered castle above the shield is [[Stockport Castle]], which stood until 1775.<ref name=\"STOCKPORT CASTLE\">{{PastScape|mnumber=1085399 | mname=STOCKPORT CASTLE | accessdate=29 August 2015|date=29 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nAfter the completion by the 2015 Group takeover of the club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the [[Stockport]] coat of arms, though the ''Animo et Fide'' motto was removed, along with a patch of green at the base of the badge; the [[flag of Cheshire]], featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010\u201311 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.<ref name=\"Npower League Two 2010 - 2011 Kits\">{{cite web | url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/season/2010-2011/league-two.html| title=Npower League Two 2010 \u2013 2011| work=Historical Kits | accessdate=9 September 2013|last=Moor|first=Dave|date=9 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe crest was altered in 2011 to re-include the town motto. The new version added two white ribbons \u2013 one at the top, with ''Animo et Fide'', and one at the bottom with ''Stockport County F.C.''. In addition, the football was again removed from the shield.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants. Still, during the [[1998\u201399 in English football|1998\u201399]] season, crowds averaged around 20,000 less than local rivals Manchester City, who were a division below Stockport at the time.<ref name=\"Archive : England 1998-1999\">{{cite web | url=http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm| title=Attendances \u2013 Archive : England 1998\u20131999| publisher=European Football Statistics | accessdate=15 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206133246/http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/archive/aveeng99.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the club notably attracted a crowd of more than 20,000 for one of its tour matches in China.

Agathe Rouget, who was born in Issoudun, was sent by her father, Doctor Rouget to be raised by her maternal relatives, the Descoings in Paris. Doctor Rouget suspects (wrongly) that he is not her true father. In Paris, she marries a man named Bridau, and they have two sons, Philippe, and Joseph. Monsieur Bridau dies relatively young, Philippe, who is the eldest and his mother's favourite, becomes a soldier in Napoleon's armies, and Joseph becomes an artist. Philippe, the elder son is shown to be a courageous soldier, but is also a heavy drinker and gambler. He resigns from the army after the [[Bourbon Restoration]] out of loyalty to [[Napoleon]]. Joseph is a dedicated artist, and the more loyal son, but his mother does not understand his artistic vocation.\n\nAfter leaving the army Philippe took part in the failed [[Champ d'Asile]] settlement in Texas. On returning to France he is unemployed, and lives with his mother and Madame Descoings, and becomes a financial drain on them, especially due to his hard drinking and gambling lifestyle. Philippe becomes estranged from his mother and brother after stealing money from Madame Descoings. Philippe is soon afterwards arrested for his involvement in an anti-government conspiracy.\n\nMeanwhile, in Issoudun, Agathe's elder brother Jean-Jacques takes in an ex-soldier named Max Gilet as a boarder. Max is suspected of being his illegitimate half brother. Max and Jean-Jacques' servant Flore Brazier work together to control Jean-Jacques. Max leads a group of young men who call themselves \"The Knights of Idleness\" who frequently play practical jokes around the town. Two of these are against a Spanish immigrant named Fario, destroying his cart and his grain, and therefore ruining his business.\n\nIt is now that Joseph and his mother travel to Issoudun to try to persuade Jean-Jacques to give Agathe money to help cover Philippe's legal costs. They stay with their friends the Hochons. Jean-Jacques and Max only give them some old paintings, but only Joseph recognises their value. Joseph tells of his luck to the Hochons, not realising that their grandsons are friends of Max. Afterwards when Max discovers the value of the paintings he coerces Joseph into returning them. Then one night whilst Max is out walking, he is stabbed by Fario. As Max is recovering he decides to blame Joseph for the stabbing. Joseph is arrested, but later cleared and released, and he and his mother return to Paris.\n\nIn the meantime, Philippe has been convicted for his plotting. However, he cooperates with authorities and gets a light sentence of five years Police supervision in [[Autun]]. Philippe gets his lawyer to change the location to Issoudun in order to claim his mother's inheritance for himself. He challenges Max to a duel with swords, and kills him in the duel. He then takes control of Jean-Jacques and his household, forcing Flore to become Jean-Jacques' wife.\n\nPhilippe marries Flore after the death of Jean-Jacques. Flore dies soon afterwards. The book hints that both of these deaths are arranged by Philippe but is not explicit about the means. Through his connexions, Philippe has now obtained the title Comte de Brambourg. Philippe's attempted marriage to a rich man's daughter falls through when his friends disclose his past to her father. An attempt by Joseph to reconcile Philippe and their mother before her death fails. Philippe's fortunes take a turn for the worse after some unsuccessful speculation, and he rejoins the army to take part in the [[French conquest of Algeria|war in Algeria]] where he is killed in action, so that in the end Joseph, now a successful artist, inherits the family fortune.\n\n==Explanation of title==\n\"La Rabouilleuse\" is the nickname of Flore Brazier used behind her back by the people of Issoudun. Max takes offence when some of his friends use it in conversation. Adamson translates the term as \"the Fisherwoman\". The nickname is a reference to the job that she did as a young girl when helping her uncle to fish for crayfish, by stirring up (to \"rabouiller\") the streamlets.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17635/17635-h/17635-h.htm|accessdate=7 April 2018|title=''Repertory of the Comedie Humaine'', entry for 'BRIDAU (Flore Brazier, Madame Philippe)'|publisher=Project Gutenberg}}\n</ref> This was before she became a servant to the Rouget household.

Primates arose 85\u201355&nbsp;million years ago first from small [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] mammals, which adapted to living in the trees of [[tropical forest]]s: many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging environment, including large brains, [[visual acuity]], [[color vision]], altered [[shoulder girdle]], and dextrous hands. Primates range in size from [[Madame Berthe's mouse lemur]], which weighs {{convert|30|g|oz|0|abbr=on}}, to the [[eastern gorilla]], weighing over {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are 190\u2013448 [[species]] of living primates, depending on which classification is used. New primate species continue to be discovered: over 25 species were described in the first decade of the 2000s, and eleven since 2010.\n\nPrimates are divided into two distinct [[suborder]]s (see diagram under History of terminology). The first suborder is called [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhines]] (from Greek 'wet-nosed'), which contains [[lemurs]], [[galagos]], and [[lorisid]]s. These primates can be found throughout Africa, Madagascar, India, and Southeast Asia. The colloquial names of species ending in ''-nosed'' refer to the [[rhinarium]] of the primate. The second suborder is called [[Haplorhini|haplorhines]], which contains \"dry-nosed\" primates (from Greek 'simple-nosed') in the [[tarsier]], [[monkey]], and [[ape]] clades. The last of these groups includes [[human]]s. [[Simian]]s (the infraorder called [[Simiiformes]] from the Greek word simos, meaning 'flat-nosed') refer to monkeys and apes, which can be classified as Old World monkeys and apes under the infraorder of [[catarrhine]]s (from Greek 'narrow nosed') or as New World monkeys under the infraorder of [[platyrrhines]] (from Greek 'flat-nosed'). Forty million years ago, simians from Africa migrated to South America by drifting on debris (presumably), which gave rise to the five families of New World monkeys. The remaining simians (catarrhines) split into apes ([[Hominoidea]]) and Old World monkeys ([[Cercopithecoidea]]) approximately twenty-five million years ago. Common species that are simians include the ([[Old World]]) [[baboon]]s, [[macaque]]s, [[gibbon]]s, and [[great ape]]s; and the ([[New World]]) [[Capuchin monkey|capuchin]]s, [[howler monkey|howler]]s and [[squirrel monkey]]s.\n\nPrimates have large brains (relative to body size) compared to other mammals, as well as an increased reliance on visual acuity at the expense of the sense of [[olfaction|smell]], which is the dominant sensory system in most mammals. These features are more developed in monkeys and apes, and noticeably less so in lorises and lemurs. Some primates are [[Trichromacy|trichromats]], with three independent channels for conveying color information. Except for [[ape]]s and [[human]]s, primates have tails. Most primates also have [[thumb|opposable thumbs]]. Many species are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]; differences may include [[muscle]] mass, [[fat]] distribution, [[pelvic]] width, canine tooth size, hair distribution, and coloration. Primates have slower rates of development than other similarly sized mammals, reach maturity later, and have longer lifespans. Depending on the species, adults may live in solitude, in mated pairs, or in groups of up to hundreds of members. Some primates, including [[gorilla]]s, humans and baboons, are primarily [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] rather than [[arboreal]], but all species have adaptations for climbing trees. Arboreal [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] techniques used include leaping from tree to tree and swinging between branches of trees ([[brachiation]]); terrestrial locomotion techniques include walking on two limbs ([[bipedal]]ism) and modified walking on four limbs ([[knuckle-walking]]).\n\nPrimates are among the most social of animals, forming pairs or family groups, uni-male harems, and multi-male/multi-female groups. Non-human primates have at least four types of [[Social structure|social systems]], many defined by the amount of movement by adolescent females between groups. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal: the exceptions are some great apes, baboons, and humans, who left the trees for the ground and now inhabit every continent.\n\nClose interactions between humans and non-human primates (NHPs) can create opportunities for the transmission of [[Zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]], especially virus diseases, including [[herpes]], [[measles]], [[ebola]], [[rabies]], and [[hepatitis]]. Thousands of non-human primates are used in research around the world because of their psychological and physiological similarity to humans. About 60% of primate species are threatened with extinction. Common threats include [[deforestation]], [[forest fragmentation]], [[monkey drive]]s, and primate hunting for use in medicines, as pets, and for food. Large-scale tropical forest clearing for agriculture most threatens primates.\n\n==History of terminology==\nThe English name \"primates\" is derived from [[Old French]] or [[French language|French]] ''primat'', from a noun use of Latin ''primat-'', from ''primus'' (\"prime, first rank\").<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Primate | encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher= [[Merriam-Webster]] | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/primate | accessdate=2008-07-21}}</ref> The name was given by [[Carl Linnaeus]] because he thought this the \"highest\" order of animals.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Book of Popular Science|page=257|year=1963|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qNtjfh57ipsC&q=primate+carl+linnaeus+highest&dq=primate+carl+linnaeus+highest}}</ref> The relationships among the different groups of primates were not clearly understood until relatively recently, so the commonly used terms are somewhat confused.

Groups that are traditionally named are shown on the right; they form an \"ascending series\" (per Clark, see above), and several groups are paraphyletic:\n* \"prosimians\" contain two monophyletic groups (the suborder Strepsirrhini, or lemurs, lorises and allies, as well as the tarsiers of the suborder Haplorhini); it is a paraphyletic grouping because it excludes the Simiiformes, which also are descendants of the common ancestor Primates.\n* \"monkeys\" comprise two monophyletic groups, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys, but is paraphyletic because it excludes hominoids, superfamily Hominoidea, also descendants of the common ancestor Simiiformes.\n* \"[[ape]]s\" as a whole, and the \"[[great apes]]\" in particular, are paraphyletic because they exclude [[human]]s.\n\nThus, the members of the two sets of groups, and hence names, do not match, which causes problems in relating scientific names to common (usually traditional) names. Consider the superfamily Hominoidea: In terms of the common names on the right, this group consists of apes and humans and there is no single common name for all the members of the group. One remedy is to create a new common name, in this case \"hominoids\". Another possibility is to expand the use of one of the traditional names. For example, in his 2005 book, the [[vertebrate]] [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] Benton wrote, \"The apes, Hominoidea, today include the gibbons and orang-utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans\";{{Sfn|Benton|2005|p=371}} thereby Benton was using \"apes\" to mean \"hominoids\". In that case, the group heretofore called \"apes\" must now be identified as the \"non-human apes\".\n\n{{As of|2005}}, there is no consensus as to whether to accept traditional (that is, common), but paraphyletic, names or to use monophyletic names only; or to use 'new' common names or adaptations of old ones. Both competing approaches can be found in biological sources, often in the same work, and sometimes by the same author. Thus, Benton defines \"apes\" to include humans, then he repeatedly uses \"ape-like\" to mean \"like an ape rather than a human\"; and when discussing the reaction of others to a new fossil he writes of \"claims that ''[[Orrorin]]'' ... was an ape rather than a human\".{{Sfn|Benton|2005|pp=378\u2013380}}\n\n==Classification of living primates==\n[[File:Primates-drawing.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1927 drawing of [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s, a [[gibbon]] (top right) and two [[orangutan]]s (center and bottom center): The [[chimpanzee]] in the upper left is brachiating; the orangutan at the bottom center is knuckle-walking.]]\n[[File:Akha cropped.png|right|upright|thumb|''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is the only living primate species that is fully bipedal]]\n[[File:NILGIRI LANGUR (Trachypithecus johnii).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nilgiri langur]] (''Trachypithecus johnii''), an [[Old World monkey]]]]\nA list of the families of the living primates is given below, together with one possible classification into ranks between order and family.<ref name=MSW3/><ref name=Cartmill2011/><ref name=\"Mittermeier2008\"/><ref name=SAP>{{cite book |author1=Rylands, A.

Primates arose 85\u201355&nbsp;million years ago first from small [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] mammals, which adapted to living in the trees of [[tropical forest]]s: many primate characteristics represent adaptations to life in this challenging environment, including large brains, [[visual acuity]], [[color vision]], altered [[shoulder girdle]], and dextrous hands. Primates range in size from [[Madame Berthe's mouse lemur]], which weighs {{convert|30|g|oz|0|abbr=on}}, to the [[eastern gorilla]], weighing over {{convert|200|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are 190\u2013448 [[species]] of living primates, depending on which classification is used. New primate species continue to be discovered: over 25 species were described in the first decade of the 2000s, and eleven since 2010.\n\nPrimates are divided into two distinct [[suborder]]s (see diagram under History of terminology). The first suborder is called [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhines]] (from Greek 'wet-nosed'), which contains [[lemurs]], [[galagos]], and [[lorisid]]s. These primates can be found throughout Africa, Madagascar, India, and Southeast Asia. The colloquial names of species ending in ''-nosed'' refer to the [[rhinarium]] of the primate. The second suborder is called [[Haplorhini|haplorhines]], which contains \"dry-nosed\" primates (from Greek 'simple-nosed') in the [[tarsier]], [[monkey]], and [[ape]] clades. The last of these groups includes [[human]]s. [[Simian]]s (the infraorder called [[Simiiformes]] from the Greek word simos, meaning 'flat-nosed') refer to monkeys and apes, which can be classified as Old World monkeys and apes under the infraorder of [[catarrhine]]s (from Greek 'narrow nosed') or as New World monkeys under the infraorder of [[platyrrhines]] (from Greek 'flat-nosed'). Forty million years ago, simians from Africa migrated to South America by drifting on debris (presumably), which gave rise to the five families of New World monkeys. The remaining simians (catarrhines) split into apes ([[Hominoidea]]) and Old World monkeys ([[Cercopithecoidea]]) approximately twenty-five million years ago. Common species that are simians include the ([[Old World]]) [[baboon]]s, [[macaque]]s, [[gibbon]]s, and [[great ape]]s; and the ([[New World]]) [[Capuchin monkey|capuchin]]s, [[howler monkey|howler]]s and [[squirrel monkey]]s.\n\nPrimates have large brains (relative to body size) compared to other mammals, as well as an increased reliance on visual acuity at the expense of the sense of [[olfaction|smell]], which is the dominant sensory system in most mammals. These features are more developed in monkeys and apes, and noticeably less so in lorises and lemurs. Some primates are [[Trichromacy|trichromats]], with three independent channels for conveying color information. Except for [[ape]]s and [[human]]s, primates have tails. Most primates also have [[thumb|opposable thumbs]]. Many species are [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]; differences may include [[muscle]] mass, [[fat]] distribution, [[pelvic]] width, canine tooth size, hair distribution, and coloration. Primates have slower rates of development than other similarly sized mammals, reach maturity later, and have longer lifespans. Depending on the species, adults may live in solitude, in mated pairs, or in groups of up to hundreds of members. Some primates, including [[gorilla]]s, humans and baboons, are primarily [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] rather than [[arboreal]], but all species have adaptations for climbing trees. Arboreal [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]] techniques used include leaping from tree to tree and swinging between branches of trees ([[brachiation]]); terrestrial locomotion techniques include walking on two limbs ([[bipedal]]ism) and modified walking on four limbs ([[knuckle-walking]]).\n\nPrimates are among the most social of animals, forming pairs or family groups, uni-male harems, and multi-male/multi-female groups. Non-human primates have at least four types of [[Social structure|social systems]], many defined by the amount of movement by adolescent females between groups. Most primate species remain at least partly arboreal: the exceptions are some great apes, baboons, and humans, who left the trees for the ground and now inhabit every continent.\n\nClose interactions between humans and non-human primates (NHPs) can create opportunities for the transmission of [[Zoonosis|zoonotic diseases]], especially virus diseases, including [[herpes]], [[measles]], [[ebola]], [[rabies]], and [[hepatitis]]. Thousands of non-human primates are used in research around the world because of their psychological and physiological similarity to humans. About 60% of primate species are threatened with extinction. Common threats include [[deforestation]], [[forest fragmentation]], [[monkey drive]]s, and primate hunting for use in medicines, as pets, and for food. Large-scale tropical forest clearing for agriculture most threatens primates.\n\n==History of terminology==\nThe English name \"primates\" is derived from [[Old French]] or [[French language|French]] ''primat'', from a noun use of Latin ''primat-'', from ''primus'' (\"prime, first rank\").<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | title=Primate | encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |publisher= [[Merriam-Webster]] | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/primate | accessdate=2008-07-21}}</ref> The name was given by [[Carl Linnaeus]] because he thought this the \"highest\" order of animals.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Book of Popular Science|page=257|year=1963|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qNtjfh57ipsC&q=primate+carl+linnaeus+highest&dq=primate+carl+linnaeus+highest}}</ref> The relationships among the different groups of primates were not clearly understood until relatively recently, so the commonly used terms are somewhat confused.

Groups that are traditionally named are shown on the right; they form an \"ascending series\" (per Clark, see above), and several groups are paraphyletic:\n* \"prosimians\" contain two monophyletic groups (the suborder Strepsirrhini, or lemurs, lorises and allies, as well as the tarsiers of the suborder Haplorhini); it is a paraphyletic grouping because it excludes the Simiiformes, which also are descendants of the common ancestor Primates.\n* \"monkeys\" comprise two monophyletic groups, New World monkeys and Old World monkeys, but is paraphyletic because it excludes hominoids, superfamily Hominoidea, also descendants of the common ancestor Simiiformes.\n* \"[[ape]]s\" as a whole, and the \"[[great apes]]\" in particular, are paraphyletic because they exclude [[human]]s.\n\nThus, the members of the two sets of groups, and hence names, do not match, which causes problems in relating scientific names to common (usually traditional) names. Consider the superfamily Hominoidea: In terms of the common names on the right, this group consists of apes and humans and there is no single common name for all the members of the group. One remedy is to create a new common name, in this case \"hominoids\". Another possibility is to expand the use of one of the traditional names. For example, in his 2005 book, the [[vertebrate]] [[palaeontology|palaeontologist]] Benton wrote, \"The apes, Hominoidea, today include the gibbons and orang-utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans\";{{Sfn|Benton|2005|p=371}} thereby Benton was using \"apes\" to mean \"hominoids\". In that case, the group heretofore called \"apes\" must now be identified as the \"non-human apes\".\n\n{{As of|2005}}, there is no consensus as to whether to accept traditional (that is, common), but paraphyletic, names or to use monophyletic names only; or to use 'new' common names or adaptations of old ones. Both competing approaches can be found in biological sources, often in the same work, and sometimes by the same author. Thus, Benton defines \"apes\" to include humans, then he repeatedly uses \"ape-like\" to mean \"like an ape rather than a human\"; and when discussing the reaction of others to a new fossil he writes of \"claims that ''[[Orrorin]]'' ... was an ape rather than a human\".{{Sfn|Benton|2005|pp=378\u2013380}}\n\n==Classification of living primates==\n[[File:Primates-drawing.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1927 drawing of [[Pan (genus)|chimpanzee]]s, a [[gibbon]] (top right) and two [[orangutan]]s (center and bottom center): The [[chimpanzee]] in the upper left is brachiating; the orangutan at the bottom center is knuckle-walking.]]\n[[File:Akha cropped.png|right|upright|thumb|''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is the only living primate species that is fully bipedal]]\n[[File:NILGIRI LANGUR (Trachypithecus johnii).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nilgiri langur]] (''Trachypithecus johnii''), an [[Old World monkey]]]]\nA list of the families of the living primates is given below, together with one possible classification into ranks between order and family.<ref name=MSW3/><ref name=Cartmill2011/><ref name=\"Mittermeier2008\"/><ref name=SAP>{{cite book |author1=Rylands, A.

{"title_page": "Scotland in the early modern period", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n{{EngvarB|date=December 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2013}}\n{{History of Scotland}}\n'''Scotland in the early modern period''' refers, for the purposes of this article, to [[Scotland]] between the death of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] in 1513 and the end of the [[Jacobite risings]] in the mid-eighteenth century. It roughly corresponds to the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period in Europe]], beginning with the [[Renaissance]] and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and ending with the start of the [[European Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Industrial Revolution in Scotland|Industrial Revolution]].\n\nAfter a long [[Minority reign|minority]], the personal reign of [[James V of Scotland|James V]] saw the court become a centre of Renaissance patronage, but it ended in military defeat and another long minority for the infant [[Mary Queen of Scots]]. Scotland hovered between dominance by the English and French, which ended in the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]] 1560, by which both withdrew their troops, but leaving the way open for religious reform. The [[Scottish Reformation]] was strongly influenced by [[Calvinism]] leading to widespread iconoclasm and the introduction of a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] system of organisation and discipline that would have a major impact on Scottish life. In 1569 Mary returned from France, but her personal reign deteriorated into murder, scandal and civil war, forcing her to escape to England where she was later executed and leaving her Protestant opponents in power in the name of the infant [[James I of England|James VI]]. In 1603 he inherited the thrones of England and Ireland, creating a dynastic union and moving the centre of royal patronage and power to London.\n\nHis son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] attempted to impose elements of the English religious settlement on his other kingdoms. Relations gradually deteriorated resulting in the [[Bishops' Wars]] (1637\u201340), ending in defeat for Charles and helping to bring about the [[War of Three Kingdoms]]. The Scots entered the war in England on the Parliamentary side, helping to turn the tide against the king's forces. In the [[Second English Civil War|Second]] and [[Third English Civil War|Third Civil War]]s (1648\u201351) they took the side of Charles I and after his execution that of his son [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], leading to defeat, occupation by a parliamentary army under [[Oliver Cromwell]] and incorporation into the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]. The [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration of the Monarchy]] in 1660 saw the return of [[episcopacy]] and an increasingly absolutist regime, resulting in religious and political upheaval and rebellions. With the accession of the openly Catholic [[James II of England|James VII]], there was increasing disquiet among Protestants. After the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688\u201389, [[William III of England|William of Orange]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]], the daughter of James, were accepted as monarchs. Presbyterianism was reintroduced and limitations placed on monarchy. After severe economic dislocation in the 1690s there were moves that led to political union with England as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707. The deposed main hereditary line of the Stuarts became a focus for political discontent, known as [[Jacobitism]], leading to a series of invasions and rebellions, but with the defeat of the last in 1745, Scotland entered a period of great political stability, economic and intellectual expansion.\n\nAlthough there was an improving system of roads in early modern Scotland, it remained a country divided by topography, particularly between the [[Highlands and Islands]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]]. Most of the economic development was in the Lowlands, which saw the beginnings of industrialisation, agricultural improvement and the expansion of eastern burghs, particularly Glasgow, as trade routes to the Americas opened up. The local [[laird]] emerged as a key figure and the heads of names and clans in the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] and Highlands declined in importance. There was a population expanding towards the end of the period and increasing urbanisation. Social tensions were evident in [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|witch trials]] and the creation of a system of [[poor laws]]. Despite the aggrandisement of the crown and the increase in forms of taxation, revenues remained inadequate. The [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]] and [[Estates of Scotland|Parliament]] remained central to government, with changing compositions and importance before the Act of Union in 1707 saw their abolition. The growth of local government saw introduction of [[Justices of the Peace]] and [[Commissioners of Supply]], while the law saw the increasing importance of royal authority and professionalisation. The expansion of parish schools and reform of universities heralded the beginnings of an intellectual flowering in the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. There was also a flowering of Scottish literature before the loss of the court as a centre of patronage at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The tradition of church music was fundamentally changed by the Reformation, with the loss of complex [[polyphonic music]] for a new tradition of [[metrical psalm]]s singing. In architecture, royal building was strongly influenced by Renaissance styles, while the houses of the great lairds adopted a hybrid form known as [[Scots baronial]] and after the Restoration was influenced by [[Palladian]] and [[Baroque]] styles. In church architecture a distinctive plain style based on a 'T'-plan emerged. The Reformation also had a major impact on art, with a loss of church patronage leading to a tradition of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings|painted ceilings]] and walls and the beginnings of a tradition of portraiture and landscape painting.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Political history==\n\n===Sixteenth century===\n\n====James V====\n{{Main|James V of Scotland}}\n[[File:Portrait of James V of Scotland (1512 - 1542).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of James V, c. 1536, by [[Corneille de Lyon]]]]\nThe death of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] at the [[Battle of Flodden]] in 1513 meant a long period of [[regency]] in the name of his infant son [[James V of Scotland|James V]].<ref>G.

James V's domestic and foreign policy successes were overshadowed by another disastrous campaign against England that led to an overwhelming defeat at the [[Battle of Solway Moss]] (1542). James died a short time later, a demise blamed by contemporaries on \"a broken heart\". The day before his death, he was brought news of the birth of an heir: a daughter, who would become [[Mary, Queen of Scots]].<ref name=Nicholls1999p87>M.

The arrival of English troops, and particularly the English fleet, in 1560, led to the besieging of the French forces in [[Siege of Leith|Leith]], which fell in July. By this point Mary of Guise had died and French and English troops both withdrew under the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]], leaving the young queen in France, but pro-English and Protestant parties in the ascendant.<ref>J.

In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first [[Martin Luther]] and then [[John Calvin]] began to influence Scotland, particularly through Scottish scholars who had visited continental and English universities and who had often trained in the Catholic priesthood. English influence was also more direct, supplying books and distributing Bibles and Protestant literature in the [[Scottish lowlands|Lowlands]] when they invaded in 1547. Particularly important was the work of the Lutheran Scot [[Patrick Hamilton (martyr)|Patrick Hamilton]].<ref>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470\u20131625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, pp.&nbsp;102\u20134.</ref> His execution with other Protestant preachers in 1528, and of the [[Zwingli]]-influenced [[George Wishart]] in 1546, who was burnt at the stake in [[St. Andrews]] on the orders of Cardinal Beaton, did nothing to stem the growth of these ideas. Wishart's supporters, who included a number of Fife lairds, assassinated Beaton soon after and seized St. Andrews Castle, which they held for a year before they were defeated with the help of French forces. The survivors, including chaplain [[John Knox]], being condemned to be galley slaves, helping to create resentment of the French and martyrs for the Protestant cause.<ref>M. F. Graham, \"Scotland\", in A. Pettegree, ''The Reformation World'' (London: Routledge, 2000), {{ISBN|0-415-16357-9}}, p. 414.</ref>\n\nLimited toleration and the influence of exiled Scots and Protestants in other countries, led to the expansion of Protestantism, with a group of lairds declaring themselves [[Lords of the Congregation]] in 1557 and representing their interests politically. The collapse of the French alliance and English intervention in 1560 meant that a relatively small, but highly influential, group of Protestants were in a position to impose reform on the Scottish church. A confession of faith, rejecting papal jurisdiction and the mass, was adopted by [[Scottish Reformation Parliament|Parliament in 1560]], while the young Mary, Queen of Scots, was still in France.<ref>J. Wormald, ''Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470\u20131625'' (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), {{ISBN|0-7486-0276-3}}, pp.&nbsp;120\u20131.</ref> Knox, having escaped the galleys and spent time in Geneva, where he had become a follower of Calvin, emerged as the most significant figure. The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a [[Presbyterian]] system and rejected most of the elaborate trappings of the medieval church. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy, and resulting in widespread, but generally orderly, [[iconoclasm]]. At this point the majority of the population was probably still Catholic in persuasion and the kirk would find it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands, but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that, compared with reformations elsewhere, was conducted with relatively little persecution.<ref>J.

Despite her private religion, she did not attempt to re-impose Catholicism on her largely Protestant subjects, thus angering the chief Catholic nobles. Her six-year personal reign was marred by a series of crises, largely caused by the intrigues and rivalries of the leading nobles. The murder of her secretary, [[David Riccio]], was followed by that of her unpopular second husband [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]], father of her infant son, and her abduction by and marriage to the [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|Earl of Bothwell]], who was implicated in Darnley's murder.<ref>R.

There were a series of minor actions in the north of Scotland, which secured the Covenanter's rear against Royalist support and skirmishing on the border.

He recalled the English Parliament, known as the [[Short Parliament]], but disbanded it after it declined to vote a new subsidy and was critical of his policies. He assembled a poorly provisioned and poorly trained army. The Scots moved south into England, forcing a crossing of the Tyne at [[Battle of Newburn|Newburn]] to the west of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], then occupying the city and eventually most of [[Northumbria]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]].

The king's attempts to raise a force in Ireland to invade Scotland from the west prompted a widespread [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|revolt]] there and as the English moved to outright opposition that resulted in the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642, he was facing rebellion in all three of his realms.<ref name=Mackieetal1991pp209-10>J.

Few Lowland Scots would follow him, but, aided by 1,000 Irish, Highland and Islesmen sent by the [[Confederate Ireland|Irish Confederates]] under [[Alasdair Mac Colla|Alasdair MacDonald (MacColla)]], he began a highly successful mobile campaign, winning victories over local Covenanter forces at [[battle of Tippermuir|Tippermuir]] and [[Battle of Aberdeen (1644)|Aberdeen]] against local levies; at [[Battle of Inverlochy (1645)|Inverlochy]] he crushed the Campbells; at [[Battle of Auldearn|Auldearn]], [[battle of Alford|Alford]] and [[battle of Kilsyth|Kilsyth]] he defeated well-led and disciplined armies. He was able to dictate terms to the Covenanters, but as he moved south, his forces, depleted by the loss of MacColla and the Highlanders, were caught and decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Philiphaugh]] by an army under [[David Leslie, Lord Newark|David Leslie]], nephew of Alexander. Escaping to the north, Montrose attempted to continue the struggle with fresh troops. By this point the king had been heavily defeated at [[the Battle of Naseby]] by Parliament's reformed [[New Model Army]] and surrendered to the Scots forces under Leslie besieging the town of [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]] in July 1646.

In 1647 he brokered the [[Engagers|Engagement]] with the King, now held by the New Model Army, by which the Scots would support him, along with risings in England as part of a [[Second English Civil War]], in exchange for the imposition of Presbyterianism on England on a three-year trial basis. The more hard-line Covenanters of the [[Kirk Party]] were defeated at a skirmish at [[Battle of Mauchline Muir|Mauchline Muir]] in June 1648 and many Covenanters, including Alexander and David Leslie, declined to join the army of 10,000 produced for the Engagement. By the time Hamilton led the Engagement army across the border, most of the English risings been defeated. The Scots were caught by the New Model Army under Cromwell on the march between Warrington and Preston. In the [[Battle of Preston (1648)|Battle of Preston]], the Scots were defeated and many captured, with Hamilton subsequently executed. After the coup of the [[Whiggamore Raid]], the Kirk Party regained control in Scotland. However, the eventual response of Cromwell and the army leaders now in power in England to the second civil war was the execution of the king in January 1649, despite Scottish protests.<ref>R.

In 1650 Montrose attempted another rising in the Highlands in the name of the King, but it ended disastrously, with Montrose being executed. Lacking tangible support from his relatives on the continent or his supporters in England, Charles accepted the offer from the Covenanters, arriving in June 1650 and signing the Covenants. The English responded with an army of 16,000 under Cromwell, which crossed the border in July 1650, while an English fleet acted in support. On 3 September 1650 the English army defeated the Scots under David Leslie at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]], taking over 10,000 prisoners and then occupying Edinburgh, taking control of the Lowlands. Charles could now more easily make an alliance with the moderate Covenanters. He was crowned at Scone on 1 January 1651 and a new army was assembled. In June 1651 Cromwell advanced against the Scots under Leslie at Stirling. The Scots army with the King set off for England, but there was no rising in their favour and the army was caught at [[Battle of Worcester|Worcester]] on 3 September. It was decisively defeated, bringing the civil wars to an end. Charles escaped to the continent, an English army occupied Scotland and Cromwell emerged as the most important figure in the Commonwealth.<ref>J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G.

Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always under-represented and had little opportunity for dissent. However, final ratification was delayed by Cromwell's problems with his various parliaments and the union did not become the subject of an act until 1657.<ref>J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G.

The failure of an invasion, led by [[Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll]], and timed to co-ordinate with the [[Monmouth Rebellion|Duke of Monmouth's rebellion]] in England, demonstrated the strength of the regime. It was believed that the king would be succeeded by his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], Stadtholder of the Netherlands, but when in 1688, James produced a male heir, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], it was clear that his policies would outlive him. An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40,000 men, and James fled, leading to the almost bloodless \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\". William called the Estates in Scotland, and as his supporters proved dominant, James' support collapsed. The Estates issued a ''[[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]]'' that suggested that James had forfeited the crown by his actions (in contrast to England, which relied on the legal fiction of an abdication) and offered it to William and Mary, which William accepted, along with limitations on royal power.<ref name=\"Mackieetal1991pp241-5\"/> The final settlement restored Presbyterianism and abolished the bishops, who had generally supported James.

The East India Company saw the venture as a potential commercial threat and the government were involved in the [[War of the Grand Alliance]] from 1689 to 1697 against France and did not want to offend Spain, which claimed the territory as part of [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]] and the English investors withdraw. Returning to Edinburgh, the Company raised \u00a3400,000 in a few weeks. Three small fleets with a total of 3,000 men eventually set out for Panama in 1698. The exercise proved a disaster. Poorly equipped; beset by incessant rain; suffering from disease; under attack by the Spanish from nearby [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]; and refused aid by the English in the [[West Indies]], the colonists abandoned their project in 1700.

However, the Scottish Parliament's parallel [[Act of Security]], merely prohibited a Roman Catholic successor, leaving open the possibility that the crowns would diverge. Rather than risk the possible return of James Francis Edward Stuart, then living in France, the English parliament pressed for full union of the two countries, passing the [[Alien Act 1705]], which threatened to make all Scotsmen unable to hold property in England unless moves toward union were made and would have severely damaged the cattle and linen trades.

The treaty confirmed the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] succession. The Church of Scotland and Scottish law and courts remained separate. The English and Scottish parliaments were replaced by a combined [[Parliament of Great Britain]], but it sat in Westminster and largely continued English traditions without interruption. Forty-five Scots were added to the 513 members of the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the [[House of Lords]]. It was also a full economic union, replacing the Scottish systems of currency, taxation and laws regulating trade.<ref name=\"Mitchison2002p314\"/> The Privy Council was abolished, which meant that effective government in Scotland lay in the hands of unofficial \"managers\", who attempted to control elections in Scotland and voting by Scottish MPs and lords in line with the prevailing party in Westminster, through a complex process of patronage, venality and coercion. Since the Tories were suspected of Jacobite sympathies, management tended to fall to one of the two groups of Whigs, the \"Old Party\" or \"Argathelian\", led by [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll]], and the \"[[Squadrone Volante (Scotland)|Squadrone]]\" or \"Patriots\", initially led by [[John Ker, 1st Duke of Roxburghe]], who became the first [[Secretary of State for Scotland]]. Roxburghe was replaced by Argyll in 1725 and he and his brother [[Archibald Campbell, 1st Earl of Ilay]], who succeeded him as 3rd Duke of Argyll in 1743, dominated Scottish politics in the first half of the eighteenth century. Both wings of the Whig movement were forced together by the Jacobite rising in 1745 and the post of Secretary of State was abolished in 1746, but Argyll remained the \"uncrowned king of Scotland\" until his death in 1761.<ref>J.

This rising (known as ''The 'Fifteen'') envisaged simultaneous uprisings in Wales, Devon, and Scotland. However, government arrests forestalled the southern ventures. In Scotland, John Erskine, [[Earl of Mar]], nicknamed ''Bobbin' John'', raised the Jacobite clans but proved to be an indecisive leader and an incompetent soldier. Mar captured Perth, but let a smaller government force under the [[John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll|Duke of Argyll]] hold the Stirling plain. Part of Mar's army joined up with risings in northern England and southern Scotland, and the Jacobites fought their way into England before being defeated at the [[Battle of Preston (1715)|Battle of Preston]], surrendering on 14 November 1715. The day before, Mar had failed to defeat Argyll at the [[Battle of Sheriffmuir]]. At this point, James belatedly landed in Scotland, but was advised that the cause was hopeless.

In 1582 a pound of silver produced 640 shillings, but in 1601 it was 960 and the exchange rate with England was \u00a36 Scots to \u00a31 sterling in 1565, but by 1601 it had fallen to \u00a312. Wages rose rapidly, by between four or five times between 1560 and the end of the century, but failed to keep pace with inflation. This situation was punctuated by frequent harvest failures, with almost half the years in the second half of the sixteenth century seeing local or national scarcity, necessitating the shipping of large quantities of grain from the Baltic. Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584\u201388 and 1597\u20131609.<ref name=Wormald1991pp166-8/> There were the beginnings of industrial manufacture in this period, often using expertise from the continent, which included a failed attempt to use Flemings to teach new techniques in the developing cloth industry in the north-east, but more successful in bringing a Venetian to help develop a native glass blowing industry.

The English [[Navigation Acts]] limited the ability of the Scots to engage in what would have been lucrative trading with England's growing colonies, but these were often circumvented, with Glasgow becoming an increasingly important commercial centre, opening up trade with the American colonies: importing sugar from the West Indies and tobacco from Virginia and Maryland. Exports across the Atlantic included linen, woollen goods, coal and grindstones.<ref name=Whatley2000p17/> The English protective tariffs on salt and cattle were harder to disregard and probably placed greater limitations on the Scottish economy, despite attempts of the King to have it overturned.

The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords.

Paisley adopted Dutch methods and became a major centre of production. Glasgow manufactured for the export trade, which doubled between 1725 and 1738. The move of the [[British Linen Company]] in 1746 into advancing cash credits also stimulated production.

The government reacted with three major pieces of legislation in 1574, 1579 and 1592. The kirk became a major element of the system of poor relief and justices of the peace were given responsibility for dealing with the issue. The 1574 act was modelled on the [[Tudor Poor Laws|English act]] passed two years earlier and limited relief to the deserving poor of the old, sick and infirm, imposing draconian punishments on a long list of \"masterful beggars\", including jugglers, [[palmistry|palmisters]] and unlicensed tutors. Parish deacons, elders or other overseers were to draw up lists of deserving poor and each would be assessed. Those not belonging to the parish were to be sent back to their place of birth and might be put in the stocks or otherwise punished, probably actually increasing the level of vagrancy.

Many of the earliest buildings were simple gabled rectangles, a style that continued to be built into the seventeenth century. A variation of the rectangular church that developed in post-Reformation Scotland was the \"T\"-shaped plan, often used when adapting existing churches, which allowed the maximum number of parishioners to be near the pulpit. In the seventeenth century a [[Greek cross]] plan was used for churches such as [[Cawdor]] (1619) and [[Fenwick, East Ayrshire|Fenwick]] (1643). In most of these cases one arm of the cross would have been closed off as a laird's aisle, meaning that they were in effect \"T\"-plan churches.<ref>A. Spicer, \"Architecture\", in A.

The parallel loss of ecclesiastical patronage created a crisis for native craftsmen and artists, who turned to secular patrons. One result of this was the flourishing of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings]] and walls, with large numbers of private houses of burgesses, lairds and lords gaining often highly detailed and coloured patterns and scenes, of which over a hundred examples survive. These include the ceiling at [[Prestongrange]], undertaken in 1581 for Mark Kerr, Commendator of Newbattle and the long gallery at [[Pinkie House]], painted for [[Alexander Seton, 1st Earl of Dunfermline|Alexander Seton]], Earl of Dunfermline in 1621. These were undertaken by unnamed Scottish artists using continental pattern books that often led to the incorporation of humanist moral and philosophical symbolism, with elements that call on heraldry, piety, classical myths and allegory.<ref name=Thomas2012pp198-9/> The tradition of royal portrait painting in Scotland was probably disrupted by the minorities and regencies it underwent for much of the sixteenth century, but began to flourish after the Reformation.

It roughly corresponds to the [[Early modern Europe|early modern period in Europe]], beginning with the [[Renaissance]] and [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and ending with the start of the [[European Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Industrial Revolution in Scotland|Industrial Revolution]].\n\nAfter a long [[Minority reign|minority]], the personal reign of [[James V of Scotland|James V]] saw the court become a centre of Renaissance patronage, but it ended in military defeat and another long minority for the infant [[Mary Queen of Scots]]. Scotland hovered between dominance by the English and French, which ended in the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]] 1560, by which both withdrew their troops, but leaving the way open for religious reform. The [[Scottish Reformation]] was strongly influenced by [[Calvinism]] leading to widespread iconoclasm and the introduction of a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] system of organisation and discipline that would have a major impact on Scottish life. In 1569 Mary returned from France, but her personal reign deteriorated into murder, scandal and civil war, forcing her to escape to England where she was later executed and leaving her Protestant opponents in power in the name of the infant [[James I of England|James VI]]. In 1603 he inherited the thrones of England and Ireland, creating a dynastic union and moving the centre of royal patronage and power to London.\n\nHis son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] attempted to impose elements of the English religious settlement on his other kingdoms. Relations gradually deteriorated resulting in the [[Bishops' Wars]] (1637\u201340), ending in defeat for Charles and helping to bring about the [[War of Three Kingdoms]]. The Scots entered the war in England on the Parliamentary side, helping to turn the tide against the king's forces. In the [[Second English Civil War|Second]] and [[Third English Civil War|Third Civil War]]s (1648\u201351) they took the side of Charles I and after his execution that of his son [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], leading to defeat, occupation by a parliamentary army under [[Oliver Cromwell]] and incorporation into the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]. The [[Restoration (Scotland)|Restoration of the Monarchy]] in 1660 saw the return of [[episcopacy]] and an increasingly absolutist regime, resulting in religious and political upheaval and rebellions. With the accession of the openly Catholic [[James II of England|James VII]], there was increasing disquiet among Protestants. After the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688\u201389, [[William III of England|William of Orange]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]], the daughter of James, were accepted as monarchs. Presbyterianism was reintroduced and limitations placed on monarchy. After severe economic dislocation in the 1690s there were moves that led to political union with England as the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] in 1707. The deposed main hereditary line of the Stuarts became a focus for political discontent, known as [[Jacobitism]], leading to a series of invasions and rebellions, but with the defeat of the last in 1745, Scotland entered a period of great political stability, economic and intellectual expansion.\n\nAlthough there was an improving system of roads in early modern Scotland, it remained a country divided by topography, particularly between the [[Highlands and Islands]] and the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]]. Most of the economic development was in the Lowlands, which saw the beginnings of industrialisation, agricultural improvement and the expansion of eastern burghs, particularly Glasgow, as trade routes to the Americas opened up. The local [[laird]] emerged as a key figure and the heads of names and clans in the [[Scottish Borders|Borders]] and Highlands declined in importance. There was a population expanding towards the end of the period and increasing urbanisation. Social tensions were evident in [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|witch trials]] and the creation of a system of [[poor laws]]. Despite the aggrandisement of the crown and the increase in forms of taxation, revenues remained inadequate. The [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]] and [[Estates of Scotland|Parliament]] remained central to government, with changing compositions and importance before the Act of Union in 1707 saw their abolition. The growth of local government saw introduction of [[Justices of the Peace]] and [[Commissioners of Supply]], while the law saw the increasing importance of royal authority and professionalisation. The expansion of parish schools and reform of universities heralded the beginnings of an intellectual flowering in the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. There was also a flowering of Scottish literature before the loss of the court as a centre of patronage at the beginning of the seventeenth century. The tradition of church music was fundamentally changed by the Reformation, with the loss of complex [[polyphonic music]] for a new tradition of [[metrical psalm]]s singing. In architecture, royal building was strongly influenced by Renaissance styles, while the houses of the great lairds adopted a hybrid form known as [[Scots baronial]] and after the Restoration was influenced by [[Palladian]] and [[Baroque]] styles. In church architecture a distinctive plain style based on a 'T'-plan emerged. The Reformation also had a major impact on art, with a loss of church patronage leading to a tradition of [[Scottish Renaissance painted ceilings|painted ceilings]] and walls and the beginnings of a tradition of portraiture and landscape painting.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Political history==\n\n===Sixteenth century===\n\n====James V====\n{{Main|James V of Scotland}}\n[[File:Portrait of James V of Scotland (1512 - 1542).jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of James V, c. 1536, by [[Corneille de Lyon]]]]\nThe death of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] at the [[Battle of Flodden]] in 1513 meant a long period of [[regency]] in the name of his infant son [[James V of Scotland|James V]].<ref>G.

In the earlier part of the century, the teachings of first [[Martin Luther]] and then [[John Calvin]] began to influence Scotland, particularly through Scottish scholars who had visited continental and English universities and who had often trained in the Catholic priesthood. English influence was also more direct, supplying books and distributing Bibles and Protestant literature in the [[Scottish lowlands|Lowlands]] when they invaded in 1547.

The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a [[Presbyterian]] system and rejected most of the elaborate trappings of the medieval church. This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds, who often had control over the appointment of the clergy, and resulting in widespread, but generally orderly, [[iconoclasm]]. At this point the majority of the population was probably still Catholic in persuasion and the kirk would find it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands, but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that, compared with reformations elsewhere, was conducted with relatively little persecution.<ref>J.

In 1650 Montrose attempted another rising in the Highlands in the name of the King, but it ended disastrously, with Montrose being executed. Lacking tangible support from his relatives on the continent or his supporters in England, Charles accepted the offer from the Covenanters, arriving in June 1650 and signing the Covenants. The English responded with an army of 16,000 under Cromwell, which crossed the border in July 1650, while an English fleet acted in support. On 3 September 1650 the English army defeated the Scots under David Leslie at the [[Battle of Dunbar (1650)|Battle of Dunbar]], taking over 10,000 prisoners and then occupying Edinburgh, taking control of the Lowlands. Charles could now more easily make an alliance with the moderate Covenanters. He was crowned at Scone on 1 January 1651 and a new army was assembled. In June 1651 Cromwell advanced against the Scots under Leslie at Stirling. The Scots army with the King set off for England, but there was no rising in their favour and the army was caught at [[Battle of Worcester|Worcester]] on 3 September. It was decisively defeated, bringing the civil wars to an end.

Various attempts were made to legitimise the union, calling representatives from the Scottish burghs and shires to negotiations and to various English parliaments, where they were always under-represented and had little opportunity for dissent. However, final ratification was delayed by Cromwell's problems with his various parliaments and the union did not become the subject of an act until 1657.<ref>J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G.

It was believed that the king would be succeeded by his daughter Mary, a Protestant and the wife of [[William III of England|William of Orange]], Stadtholder of the Netherlands, but when in 1688, James produced a male heir, [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], it was clear that his policies would outlive him. An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40,000 men, and James fled, leading to the almost bloodless \"[[Glorious Revolution]]\". William called the Estates in Scotland, and as his supporters proved dominant, James' support collapsed. The Estates issued a ''[[Claim of Right Act 1689|Claim of Right]]'' that suggested that James had forfeited the crown by his actions (in contrast to England, which relied on the legal fiction of an abdication) and offered it to William and Mary, which William accepted, along with limitations on royal power.<ref name=\"Mackieetal1991pp241-5\"/> The final settlement restored Presbyterianism and abolished the bishops, who had generally supported James.

However, the Scottish Parliament's parallel [[Act of Security]], merely prohibited a Roman Catholic successor, leaving open the possibility that the crowns would diverge.

Forty-five Scots were added to the 513 members of the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] and 16 Scots to the 190 members of the [[House of Lords]].

Distress was exacerbated by outbreaks of plague, with major epidemics in the periods 1584\u201388 and 1597\u20131609.<ref name=Wormald1991pp166-8/> There were the beginnings of industrial manufacture in this period, often using expertise from the continent, which included a failed attempt to use Flemings to teach new techniques in the developing cloth industry in the north-east, but more successful in bringing a Venetian to help develop a native glass blowing industry.

The English [[Navigation Acts]] limited the ability of the Scots to engage in what would have been lucrative trading with England's growing colonies, but these were often circumvented, with Glasgow becoming an increasingly important commercial centre, opening up trade with the American colonies: importing sugar from the West Indies and tobacco from Virginia and Maryland.

Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and [[crop rotation]] were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the runrig system and free pasture. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the borders of sheep.

Paisley adopted Dutch methods and became a major centre of production. Glasgow manufactured for the export trade, which doubled between 1725 and 1738. The move of the [[British Linen Company]] in 1746 into advancing cash credits also stimulated production.
