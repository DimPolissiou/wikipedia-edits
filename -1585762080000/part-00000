Lee]] (professor of religion and Asian studies at Calvin University) of Gertoux's work is present: \n{{quote|In contrast to the long-held Jewish tradition, the author claims that the name of God in the HB should be pronounced. His claim is based on Exod 9:16, \"... to make my name resound through all the earth\" and Maimonides' work stressing the impossibility of a deep, personal relationship with a nameless God. With a survey of the historical record from \"Adam\" to the American Standard Version, Gertoux argues that the letters Y, W, H are read as the vowels I (or E), U (or O), and A. For the H, a mute e could be added in order to be better heard. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, is therefore read I-eH-U-A (Iehoua), the equivalent of YeHoWaH in Masoretic punctuation. This means that the name is to be pronounced as it is written, or according to its letters. The result is that the tetragrammaton is the only Hebrew name constituted, not of four consonants, but of four vowels, as noted by Josephus. This detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation over the centuries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=285}}}} \n\nDidier M. Fontaine reports that G. Gertoux \"shows how frequent the use of the Name has been, from the earliest times to around c.150, when the Jews began, both orally and in writing, to show serious reservations about the use of the divine name, especially with non-Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://areopage.net/blog/2015/04/07/le-nom-divin-imprononcable-gertoux-2015/|author=Didier Micka\u00ebl Fontaine|title=Le nom divin: impronon\u00e7able?

J. Wilkinson states: \"the book is intended to be a work of history, and I have thus eschewed theological comment as inappropriate. I am unaware of any previous work with the scope of this book, unless it be found among those who wish to promote (or prohibit) a devotional or liturgical use of the Tetragrammaton or hold strong views about its pronunciation and meaning\", and at the footnote of the page he points out that he considers that in the French version of G. Gertoux's book a chronological account of the tetragrammaton is offered, but \"he is primarily interested in supporting his assertion that the Tetragrammaton has always been read \"according to his letters,\" i.e. ''yhwh'' treated as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' and vocalized \"Jehovah\".\" R. J. Wilkinson adds G. Gertoux believes that \"the eclipse of the name was part of a satanic strategy and he believes that the Tetragrammaton appeared in the first New Testament texts.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=38}}\n\nAnne Pasquier (Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Laval University) based on the book by G. Gertoux states that \"the perfume is associated with the divine name\", \"theme of good smell is linked to the name in the Bible\", and concludes that in [[Song of Songs]] 1,3: \"there is indeed a play on words in Hebrew between the expression \"your name\" (shem\u00e9ka) and \"your scented oils\" (sheman\u00e9ka), the name of God being comparable to an incense.\"{{sfn|Pasquier|2011|pp=126}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois B\u0153spflug]] (professor emeritus of history of religions at the Faculty of Catholic Theology in Strasbourg ) wrote that G.

Ross, (professor at the Biblical Institute of the Baptist Church in Mukwonago (Wisconsin)), agrees with G. Gertoux, who states that the Masoretic points must indicate the correct pronunciation, because it is inconceivable that God allows lose the correct pronunciation of his name, and that, despite the grammatical processes of mutation of the vowels when they are far from the accent (as ''d\u0101b\u0101r'' to the plural is made ''d\u0259b\u0101r\u012bm''). T. D. Ross considers significant, like Gertoux, that the theophoric names do not contain the vowels of Yahweh but those of [[Jehovah]].<ref>{{cite document|author=Thomas D. Ross|title=Trinitarianism Syllabus|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.8315}}</ref> T. D. Ross also considers the work of G.

Gertoux on the idea that he \"postulated that the perpetual qere was not for Adonai, but for Shema\", and considers that some have recently pointed out \"a number of problems with [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]'s theory.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins of Adonai in the Hebrew Scriptures|author=Ren Manetti|url=https://www.academia.edu/4428591}}</ref>\n\nDaniel Faivre calls Yahweh the most frequent vocalization, \"but considers that it is not formally consolidated\" and therefore prefers to \"use the tetragrammaton in its consonant integrity\" and then quotes the work of G. Gertoux in its French version as \"a more complete study.\"{{sfn|Faivre|2007|pp=13}}\n\nIn observations of [[4Q120]] and some Hebrew words among some scrolls, [[George Wesley Buchanan]] (Professor Emeritus at Wesley Theological Seminary) claim that \"for many years scholars have mistakenly assumed that the Tetragrammaton was to be correctly pronounced ''Y\u00e1h-weh'', treating the central vowel as if it were a consonant. This error has recently been corrected.\"{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=11}} G. W. Buchanan thinks that there are arguments for the pronounciation Yahowah, but agrees with G. Gertoux in that \"based on this data, the divine name will be spelled arbitrarily ''Yehowah''.{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=12}}\n\nSarah Lind reports the study of Gertoux and say that \"G. maintains a website with excerpts at divinename.net.\": G\u00e9rard Gertoux. 2002.

Un Nom Encens (L\u2019Harmattan, 1999). G. follows Maimonides\u2019 teaching that that YHWH \u201cis read as it is written,\u201d i.e., yehua, in the same way that yhwdh is vocalized yehuda\u2014applying the (coincidentally correct) Masoretic vowels. G. first considers biblical treatment of \u201cthe name\u201d: the power of the name; to know God\u2019s name; Jesus, Satan, the controversy over the name; and \u201cthe name read distinctly\u201d (reconstruction of the reading).

Gilligan states: \"because God is wondrous and mighty\u2014an object of awe\u2014the name of God would also be wondrous and mighty, intended to be spoken or sung with reverence. In a biblical culture, the name of God would express God\u2019s majesty and power\" and adds: \"to put it in other terms, a biblical name (in a sense) was an alter ego; it represented the person. To know someone\u2019s name was to know who and what the person was: not only his or her character or qualities, but especially his or her power, role, or function\u2014what the individual was empowered to do. To be without a name was to be worthless, of no importance.\"<ref name=Gilligan/>\n\n==== Some comments of his thesis ====\nE. J. Revell (Professor emeritus at the [[University of Toronto]]) claim: I was very interested to read the copy of your work which you sent me. Before reading your study, had no particular opinion on the pronunciation of the name of God. As a student in the 50\u2019s, I was told that scholars have determined that \u201cYahweh\u201d was the ancient pronunciation. I did not find the argument wellgrounded, but the view was held almost as an article of faith by my instructors, and I had no superior argument, so I ignored the problem. I have occasionally thought about it since, but I have not acquired any information that you have not noticed in your study.

Lee]] (professor of religion and Asian studies at Calvin University) of Gertoux's work is present: \n{{quote|In contrast to the long-held Jewish tradition, the author claims that the name of God in the HB should be pronounced. His claim is based on Exod 9:16, \"... to make my name resound through all the earth\" and Maimonides' work stressing the impossibility of a deep, personal relationship with a nameless God. With a survey of the historical record from \"Adam\" to the American Standard Version, Gertoux argues that the letters Y, W, H are read as the vowels I (or E), U (or O), and A. For the H, a mute e could be added in order to be better heard. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, is therefore read I-eH-U-A (Iehoua), the equivalent of YeHoWaH in Masoretic punctuation. This means that the name is to be pronounced as it is written, or according to its letters. The result is that the tetragrammaton is the only Hebrew name constituted, not of four consonants, but of four vowels, as noted by Josephus. This detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation over the centuries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=285}}}} \n\nDidier M. Fontaine reports that G. Gertoux \"shows how frequent the use of the Name has been, from the earliest times to around c.150, when the Jews began, both orally and in writing, to show serious reservations about the use of the divine name, especially with non-Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://areopage.net/blog/2015/04/07/le-nom-divin-imprononcable-gertoux-2015/|author=Didier Micka\u00ebl Fontaine|title=Le nom divin: impronon\u00e7able?

J. Wilkinson states: \"the book is intended to be a work of history, and I have thus eschewed theological comment as inappropriate. I am unaware of any previous work with the scope of this book, unless it be found among those who wish to promote (or prohibit) a devotional or liturgical use of the Tetragrammaton or hold strong views about its pronunciation and meaning\", and at the footnote of the page he points out that he considers that in the French version of G. Gertoux's book a chronological account of the tetragrammaton is offered, but \"he is primarily interested in supporting his assertion that the Tetragrammaton has always been read \"according to his letters,\" i.e. ''yhwh'' treated as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' and vocalized \"Jehovah\".\" R. J. Wilkinson adds G. Gertoux believes that \"the eclipse of the name was part of a satanic strategy and he believes that the Tetragrammaton appeared in the first New Testament texts.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=38}}\n\nAnne Pasquier (Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Laval University) based on the book by G. Gertoux states that \"the perfume is associated with the divine name\", \"theme of good smell is linked to the name in the Bible\", and concludes that in [[Song of Songs]] 1,3: \"there is indeed a play on words in Hebrew between the expression \"your name\" (shem\u00e9ka) and \"your scented oils\" (sheman\u00e9ka), the name of God being comparable to an incense.\"{{sfn|Pasquier|2011|pp=126}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois B\u0153spflug]] (professor emeritus of history of religions at the Faculty of Catholic Theology in Strasbourg ) wrote that G.

Ross, (professor at the Biblical Institute of the Baptist Church in Mukwonago (Wisconsin)), agrees with G. Gertoux, who states that the Masoretic points must indicate the correct pronunciation, because it is inconceivable that God allows lose the correct pronunciation of his name, and that, despite the grammatical processes of mutation of the vowels when they are far from the accent (as ''d\u0101b\u0101r'' to the plural is made ''d\u0259b\u0101r\u012bm''). T. D. Ross considers significant, like Gertoux, that the theophoric names do not contain the vowels of Yahweh but those of [[Jehovah]].<ref>{{cite document|author=Thomas D. Ross|title=Trinitarianism Syllabus|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.8315}}</ref> T. D. Ross also considers the work of G.

Gertoux on the idea that he \"postulated that the perpetual qere was not for Adonai, but for Shema\", and considers that some have recently pointed out \"a number of problems with [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]'s theory.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins of Adonai in the Hebrew Scriptures|author=Ren Manetti|url=https://www.academia.edu/4428591}}</ref>\n\nDaniel Faivre calls Yahweh the most frequent vocalization, \"but considers that it is not formally consolidated\" and therefore prefers to \"use the tetragrammaton in its consonant integrity\" and then quotes the work of G. Gertoux in its French version as \"a more complete study.\"{{sfn|Faivre|2007|pp=13}}\n\nIn observations of [[4Q120]] and some Hebrew words among some scrolls, [[George Wesley Buchanan]] (Professor Emeritus at Wesley Theological Seminary) claim that \"for many years scholars have mistakenly assumed that the Tetragrammaton was to be correctly pronounced ''Y\u00e1h-weh'', treating the central vowel as if it were a consonant. This error has recently been corrected.\"{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=11}} G. W. Buchanan thinks that there are arguments for the pronounciation Yahowah, but agrees with G. Gertoux in that \"based on this data, the divine name will be spelled arbitrarily ''Yehowah''.{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=12}}\n\nSarah Lind reports the study of Gertoux and say that \"G. maintains a website with excerpts at divinename.net.\": G\u00e9rard Gertoux. 2002.

As a student in the 50\u2019s, I was told that scholars have determined that \u201cYahweh\u201d was the ancient pronunciation. I did not find the argument wellgrounded, but the view was held almost as an article of faith by my instructors, and I had no superior argument, so I ignored the problem. I have occasionally thought about it since, but I have not acquired any information that you have not noticed in your study.

The town was so named because the [[Sac (people)|Sac]] and [[Meskwaki|Fox]] Indians{{refn|group=nb|Sometimes known as the Sauk and Fox\u2014the French name \"Sac\" and the English equivalent \"Sauk\" are both correct and interchangeable. Both words were derived from the Indian word \"Asakiwaki,\" meaning \"yellow earth people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigorrin.org/sf_kids.htm|title=Sac and Fox Indian Fact Sheet|publisher=Native Languages of the Americas website|accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref>}} were in possession of the land at the time of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The City of Sac City was incorporated 19 years later, in 1874.\n\nJudge Eugene Criss, credited with being the father of Sac City, left [[Wisconsin]] and crossed the [[Mississippi River]] in the early months of 1855 by [[covered wagon]]. He was in search of waterpower and had the desire to establish a settlement in a new and untried country. Deciding upon the [[North Raccoon River]] to begin his settlement, Judge Criss proceeded to erect the first [[log cabin]] in Sac City, establish himself in the [[hotel]] business, as well as keep a stage station and [[general store]] for nearby settlers.\n\nAs early as 1859, there was talk of building a [[railroad]] through Sac County, but the first railroad did not come through Sac City until 1879. The railroad companies refused to lay tracks through undeveloped or mildly developed areas, and Sac City did not meet the requirements. The railroad companies demanded communities be far enough advanced to provide a quick return to capital before they would construct a steam and iron highway through the area. When it came, the railroad benefited Sac City incredibly. The [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]] connected Sac City, Wall Lake, Auburn, Odebolt, Lake View, Early, and Schaller as well as the cities where crops were sold.\n\nThe first Sac County Fair was held in 1871 on {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of ground east of Sac City that had been purchased by the Sac County Agricultural Society the same year. The fair was one of the biggest events of the year and brought people in wagons and buggies from miles around to see the harness races, livestock exhibits, produce, needlework, and art goods.\n\nThe Sac City [[Chautauqua]] Association was organized in December 1904 with 120 members. The Association brought many fine programs to the community, and because transportation was still slow and laborious, many families stayed in tents on the grounds for the entire Chautauqua session, about eight or nine days. At first the meetings were held in a tent, but by 1908, the citizens of Sac City built a Chautauqua Building in which to hold their meetings, and which is now the only one left of its kind in the state of Iowa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saccity.org/pages/historic-sac-city.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129101950/http://saccity.org/pages/historic-sac-city.html |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}, Accessed 2010-02-18.</ref>\n\n===Modern-day===\nIn May 2017 lifelong Sac City resident and businessman John Criss donated [[US$]]5.7 million of his [[Estate (law)|estate]] to the city for [[beautification]] projects.<ref name=\"John Criss\">{{cite web|author1=Kyle Munson|title=A quiet bachelor left behind $5.7 million to help save his small Iowa town.

The town was so named because the [[Sac (people)|Sac]] and [[Meskwaki|Fox]] Indians{{refn|group=nb|Sometimes known as the Sauk and Fox\u2014the French name \"Sac\" and the English equivalent \"Sauk\" are both correct and interchangeable. Both words were derived from the Indian word \"Asakiwaki,\" meaning \"yellow earth people\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigorrin.org/sf_kids.htm|title=Sac and Fox Indian Fact Sheet|publisher=Native Languages of the Americas website|accessdate=2011-08-09}}</ref>}} were in possession of the land at the time of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. The City of Sac City was incorporated 19 years later, in 1874.\n\nJudge Eugene Criss, credited with being the father of Sac City, left [[Wisconsin]] and crossed the [[Mississippi River]] in the early months of 1855 by [[covered wagon]]. He was in search of waterpower and had the desire to establish a settlement in a new and untried country. Deciding upon the [[North Raccoon River]] to begin his settlement, Judge Criss proceeded to erect the first [[log cabin]] in Sac City, establish himself in the [[hotel]] business, as well as keep a stage station and [[general store]] for nearby settlers.\n\nAs early as 1859, there was talk of building a [[railroad]] through Sac County, but the first railroad did not come through Sac City until 1879. The railroad companies refused to lay tracks through undeveloped or mildly developed areas, and Sac City did not meet the requirements. The railroad companies demanded communities be far enough advanced to provide a quick return to capital before they would construct a steam and iron highway through the area. When it came, the railroad benefited Sac City incredibly. The [[Chicago and North Western Transportation Company]] connected Sac City, Wall Lake, Auburn, Odebolt, Lake View, Early, and Schaller as well as the cities where crops were sold.\n\nThe first Sac County Fair was held in 1871 on {{convert|10|acre|m2}} of ground east of Sac City that had been purchased by the Sac County Agricultural Society the same year. The fair was one of the biggest events of the year and brought people in wagons and buggies from miles around to see the harness races, livestock exhibits, produce, needlework, and art goods.\n\nThe Sac City [[Chautauqua]] Association was organized in December 1904 with 120 members. The Association brought many fine programs to the community, and because transportation was still slow and laborious, many families stayed in tents on the grounds for the entire Chautauqua session, about eight or nine days. At first the meetings were held in a tent, but by 1908, the citizens of Sac City built a Chautauqua Building in which to hold their meetings, and which is now the only one left of its kind in the state of Iowa.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saccity.org/pages/historic-sac-city.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129101950/http://saccity.org/pages/historic-sac-city.html |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}, Accessed 2010-02-18.</ref>\n\n===Modern-day===\nIn May 2017 lifelong Sac City resident and businessman John Criss donated [[US$]]5.7 million of his [[Estate (law)|estate]] to the city for [[beautification]] projects.<ref name=\"John Criss\">{{cite web|author1=Kyle Munson|title=A quiet bachelor left behind $5.7 million to help save his small Iowa town.

However, this doesn't necessarily hold in second-order weak reactions, where there are mixes of {{SubatomicParticle|Kaon0}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Antikaon0}} mesons. All in all, the amount of strangeness can change in a weak interaction reaction by +1, 0 or -1 (depending on the reaction).\n\nFor example, the interaction of a K<sup>-</sup> meson with a proton is represented as:\n\n<math>K^-+p \\rightarrow \\Xi^0+K^0</math>\n\n<math>(-1) + (0) \\rightarrow (-2) + (1)</math>\n\nHere strangeness is conserved and the interaction proceeds via the strong nuclear force.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1968/alvarez/lecture/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1968|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in reactions like the decay of the positive kaon:\n\n<math>k^+ \\rightarrow \\pi^+ + \\pi^0</math>\n\n<math>-1 \\rightarrow (0) + (0)</math>\n\nSince both pions have a strangeness of 0, this violates conservation of strangeness, meaning the reaction must go via the weak force.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Strangeness production]]\n\n==References==\n[[Category:Concepts in physics]]\n[[Category:Quarks]]\n[[Category:Flavour (particle physics)]]\n[[Category:Strange quark]]\n\n[[he:\u05de\u05d5\u05d6\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea]]\n\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n", "name_user": "Bibliophilen", "label": "safe", "comment": "Contributing inline citations.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness"}

The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28.

Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic sentiment to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28.

This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY Metro Area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13.

Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.
