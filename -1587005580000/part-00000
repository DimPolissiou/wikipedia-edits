There are two models: the A4000/040 released in October 1992 with a [[Motorola 68040]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], and the A4000/030 released in April 1993 with a [[Motorola 68EC030]].\n\nThe Amiga 4000 system design was generally similar to that of the A3000, but introduced the [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) chipset with enhanced graphics. The [[SCSI]] system from previous Amigas was replaced by the lower-cost [[Parallel ATA]].\n\nThe original A4000 is housed in a beige horizontal desktop box with a separate keyboard. Later, Commodore released an expanded tower version called the [[Amiga 4000T|A4000T]].\n\n==Technical information==\n\n=== Processor and RAM ===\nThe stock A4000 shipped with either a [[Motorola 68EC030]] or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], 2&nbsp;MB of [[Amiga Chip RAM]] and up to 16&nbsp;MB of additional RAM in 32-bit [[SIMM]]s.<ref name=\"a4000_user\">{{citation | url=http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613032230/http://www.bombjack.org/commodore/amiga/amiga-commodore/A4000_Users_Guide_(UK).pdf | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-06-13 | title=A4000 User's Guide | publisher=Commodore Electronics Limited | year=1992 }}</ref> There is a non-functional jumper that was intended to expand the \"chip RAM\" to 8MB.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zimmers.net/cbmpics/cbm/amiga/a4000jumpers.html | title=A4000 Motherboard Jumpers | accessdate=2 September 2011}}</ref> Later, third-party developers created various CPU expansion boards featuring higher-rated [[Motorola 68040|68040]], [[Motorola 68060|68060]] and [[PowerPC]] CPUs. Such hardware also typically offers faster and higher-capacity RAM (128&nbsp;MB or greater).\n\n===A4000-CR version===\nUnlike previous Amiga models, early A4000 machines have the CPU mounted in an expansion board; the [[motherboard]] does not have an integrated CPU. Later revisions of the A4000 have the CPU and 2&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] RAM [[surface-mount technology|surface-mounted]] on the motherboard in an effort to reduce costs. These machines are known as the A4000-CR (cost-reduced) and the surface-mounted CPU is a 68EC030. The cost-reduced models also make use of a non-rechargeable lithium battery for real-time clock battery backup rather than a rechargeable [[nickel-cadmium battery|NiCad battery]]. The NiCad backup battery is one of the most common causes of problems in an aging device that uses one because it has a tendency to eventually leak. The released fluids are somewhat corrosive and can eventually damage the circuitry.\n\n===Graphics and sound===\nThe A4000 is the first Amiga model to have shipped with Commodore's third-generation Amiga chipset, the 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA). As the name implies, AGA introduces improved graphical abilities, specifically, a palette expanded from 12-bit color depth (4096 colors) to 24-bit (16.8 million colors) and new 64, 128, 256 and 262,144 ([[hold-and-modify|HAM-8]]) color modes. Unlike earlier Amiga chipsets, all color modes are available at all display resolutions. AGA also improves sprite capacity and graphics performance. The on-board sound hardware remains identical to that of the original Amiga chipset (the [[original Amiga chipset#Audio features in general|Paula sound chip]]), namely, four [[direct memory access|DMA]]-driven 8-bit [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] channels, with two channels for the left speaker and two for the right.\n\n===Peripherals and expansion===\nThe A4000 has a number of Amiga-specific connectors, including two [[DE-9 connector|DE-9]] ports for [[joystick]]s, [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], and [[light pen]]s, a standard 25-pin [[RS-232]] [[serial port]] and a 25-pin [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]]. As a result, at launch the A4000 was compatible with many existing Amiga peripherals, such as [[MIDI]] devices, serial [[modem]]s and [[sampling (signal processing)|sound samplers]].<ref name=\"a4000_user\"/>\n\nLike the just-earlier Amiga model, the [[Amiga 3000|3000]], the A4000 has four internal 32-bit [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro III]] expansion slots. This expansion bus allows the use of devices which comply with the [[AutoConfig]] standard, such as graphic cards, audio cards, network cards, SCSI controllers, and later even [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] controllers.<ref name=\"zorro3\">{{citation | url=http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | title=The Zorro III Bus Specification | first=Dave | last=Haynie | date=20 March 1991 | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | access-date=2 September 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212151/http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | archive-date=16 July 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> One of the most notable hardware items of the era is the [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] system which became popular in the 1990s for amateur and commercial [[desktop video]] production of [[standard-definition]] [[broadcast quality]] video, consisting of tools for [[vision mixer|video switching]], [[chroma key]]ing, [[character generator|character generation]], [[animation]], and [[image manipulation]].\n\nThe three [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] slots can be activated by use of a bridgeboard, which connects the Zorro and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board [[IBM PC Compatible|IBM-PC-compatible]] hardware, including [[Intel 80286]], [[80386]], or [[80486]] microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware. Compatible ISA cards may then be installed into the two remaining ISA slots.\n\nLater, in an effort to offer modern expansion options third-party developers created replacement expansion boards for the A4000 which provide [[peripheral component interconnect|PCI]] slots allowing use of higher performance and widely available PCI hardware, such as graphic, sound, and network cards.\n\n===Operating system===\nThe A4000 shipped with [[AmigaOS version history#Amiga_OS_3.0,_3.1|AmigaOS 3.0]], consisting of Workbench 3.0 and [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 3.0, which together provide a single-user multi-tasking operating system and support for the built-in hardware. Following release of AmigaOS 3.1 it became possible to upgrade the A4000 by installing compatible Kickstart 3.1 ROM chips. The later AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 releases were software-only updates requiring Kickstart 3.1.\n\n[[AmigaOS 4]], a [[PowerPC]]-native release of the operating system, can be used with the A4000 provided a [[PowerUP (accelerator)#CyberStorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]] board is installed. Likewise, [[MorphOS]], an alternative Amiga-compatible operating system, can be used with this hardware.\n\nVariants of platform-independent operating systems, such as [[Linux]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], can also be used with the A4000.\n\n[[File:A4000 \u00f6ppen.png|right|thumb|Amiga 4000 with case open]]\n[[File:Amiga A3200 A3400 CPU card.jpg|thumb|Amiga A3200/A3400 CPU card]]\n\n===Specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The NiCad backup battery is one of the most common causes of problems in an aging device that uses one because it has a tendency to eventually leak. The released fluids are somewhat corrosive and can eventually damage the circuitry.\n\n===Graphics and sound===\nThe A4000 is the first Amiga model to have shipped with Commodore's third-generation Amiga chipset, the 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA). As the name implies, AGA introduces improved graphical abilities, specifically, a palette expanded from 12-bit color depth (4096 colors) to 24-bit (16.8 million colors) and new 64, 128, 256 and 262,144 ([[hold-and-modify|HAM-8]]) color modes. Unlike earlier Amiga chipsets, all color modes are available at all display resolutions. AGA also improves sprite capacity and graphics performance. The on-board sound hardware remains identical to that of the original Amiga chipset (the [[original Amiga chipset#Audio features in general|Paula sound chip]]), namely, four [[direct memory access|DMA]]-driven 8-bit [[Pulse code modulation|PCM]] channels, with two channels for the left speaker and two for the right.\n\n===Peripherals and expansion===\nThe A4000 has a number of Amiga-specific connectors, including two [[DE-9 connector|DE-9]] ports for [[joystick]]s, [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], and [[light pen]]s, a standard 25-pin [[RS-232]] [[serial port]] and a 25-pin [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]]. As a result, at launch the A4000 was compatible with many existing Amiga peripherals, such as [[MIDI]] devices, serial [[modem]]s and [[sampling (signal processing)|sound samplers]].<ref name=\"a4000_user\"/>\n\nLike the just-earlier Amiga model, the [[Amiga 3000|3000]], the A4000 has four internal 32-bit [[Amiga Zorro III|Zorro III]] expansion slots. This expansion bus allows the use of devices which comply with the [[AutoConfig]] standard, such as graphic cards, audio cards, network cards, SCSI controllers, and later even [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] controllers.<ref name=\"zorro3\">{{citation | url=http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | title=The Zorro III Bus Specification | first=Dave | last=Haynie | date=20 March 1991 | publisher=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | access-date=2 September 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716212151/http://www.thule.no/haynie/zorroiii/docs/zorro3.pdf | archive-date=16 July 2012 | url-status=dead }}</ref> One of the most notable hardware items of the era is the [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] system which became popular in the 1990s for amateur and commercial [[desktop video]] production of [[standard-definition]] [[broadcast quality]] video, consisting of tools for [[vision mixer|video switching]], [[chroma key]]ing, [[character generator|character generation]], [[animation]], and [[image manipulation]].\n\nThe three [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] slots can be activated by use of a bridgeboard, which connects the Zorro and ISA buses. Such bridgeboards typically feature on-board [[IBM PC Compatible|IBM-PC-compatible]] hardware, including [[Intel 80286]], [[80386]], or [[80486]] microprocessors allowing emulation of an entire IBM-PC system in hardware. Compatible ISA cards may then be installed into the two remaining ISA slots.\n\nLater, in an effort to offer modern expansion options third-party developers created replacement expansion boards for the A4000 which provide [[peripheral component interconnect|PCI]] slots allowing use of higher performance and widely available PCI hardware, such as graphic, sound, and network cards.\n\n===Operating system===\nThe A4000 shipped with [[AmigaOS version history#Amiga_OS_3.0,_3.1|AmigaOS 3.0]], consisting of Workbench 3.0 and [[Kickstart (Amiga)|Kickstart]] 3.0, which together provide a single-user multi-tasking operating system and support for the built-in hardware. Following release of AmigaOS 3.1 it became possible to upgrade the A4000 by installing compatible Kickstart 3.1 ROM chips. The later AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9 releases were software-only updates requiring Kickstart 3.1.\n\n[[AmigaOS 4]], a [[PowerPC]]-native release of the operating system, can be used with the A4000 provided a [[PowerUP (accelerator)#CyberStorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]] board is installed. Likewise, [[MorphOS]], an alternative Amiga-compatible operating system, can be used with this hardware.\n\nVariants of platform-independent operating systems, such as [[Linux]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], can also be used with the A4000.\n\n[[File:A4000 \u00f6ppen.png|right|thumb|Amiga 4000 with case open]]\n[[File:Amiga A3200 A3400 CPU card.jpg|thumb|Amiga A3200/A3400 CPU card]]\n\n===Specifications===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!
