Roberts described himself as a \"motion-picture writer\" who had worked in that business since 1936 for studios major (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Columbia, Universal) and minor (Monogram).  Roberts tried to explain to the committee that, \"It is very difficult for us to understand, but communism in Hollywood, as I have seen it, is on a purely local level.  It doesn't seem to go anywhere.\"  In 1938, Roberts first met [[Ben Barzman]]'s home, where members like [[John Howard Lawson]] asked him to join.  In late April or early May 1945, right after the death of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (\"the death of liberalism in America\"), [[Bernard C. Schoenfeld]] got him to join.  Two or three other \"delegates\" came to visit Roberts after that, one of whom was Edward Huebsch.  These delegates, including Huebsch, persuaded him that \"The party was merely interested in the things that I was interested in, better conditions in the Screen Writers' Guild, better labor conditions in Hollywood, higher wages, and so forth, and in furthering Roosevelt's policies.\"  Roberts left the Party in 1946, but Huebsch came back to ask him to rejoin and support the  Conference of Studio Unions (CSU) strike (see \"[[Hollywood Black Friday]]\").<ref name=Hearing1952>\n{{cite book\n| title = Communist Infiltration of Hollywood Motion-picture Industry\n| publisher = US GPO\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l-hRAQAAIAAJ\n| pages = 3530-3531 (recruitment), 3533 (magazine), 3535 (strike)\n| date = 20 May 1952\n| accessdate = 28 April 2020}}</ref>  \n[[File:Dalton_Trumbo_prison_1950.jpg|thumb|right|Huebsch's colleagues included [[Dalton Trumbo]] (from mugshot dated 1950-06-09 at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Ashland]])]]\nRoberts then went on the name Huebsch as a member of Communist-dominated groups in Hollywood:\n* Screen Writers Guild:  [[Ben Barzman]], [[John Howard Lawson]], [[Bernard C.

Esterman.  Initially, Huebsch objected to the televising of hearings by Congress, a point to which the committee acceded and rescheduled his hearing.  On March 24, 1953, David A. Lang, a fellow screen writer, named Huebsch as part of a Communist cell whose members also included: [[George Bassman]], Nick Bela, [[Edward Biberman]], [[Henry Blankfort]], Laurie Blankfort, William Blowitz, [[Hugo Butler]], Howard Dimsdale, Morton Grant, [[Lester Koenig]], [[Millard Lampell]], Pauline Lagerfin, [[Isobel Lennart]], [[Al Levitt]], [[Arnold Manoff]], [[Mortimer Offner]], W.L. River, Bob Robert, [[Marguerite Roberts]], [[John Stanford]], Wilma Shore, George Sklar, [[Bess Taffel]], [[Seymour Bennett]], Eunice Mindlin, and Val Burton.  Lang also described a \"Writers' Clinic\" to which many Hollywood Ten writers belonged.  On March 25, 1953, Huebsch returned for testimony, this time counseled not only by Esterman but also Daniel G. Marshall.  Huebsch began by correcting the committee, saying he had not asked for no televisions but for a quashing of his subpoena.  The committee disregarded his request but assured him he was not being recorded.  After a short biography, the committee pressed him to state whether he had ever been a member of the [[Communist Party USA]].  Huebsch declined to answer, citing the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].  The committee pressed him by demanding he cite which provision of the Fifth Amendment, etc.  Huebsch was equally aggressive, calling committee chairman [[Harold Velde]] \"King Harold Velde\" (in reference to [[King George III]]).  When the committee tried to press Huebsch into strictly \"yes\" or \"no\" answers, Huebsch cited a passage in the Fifth Amendment that prohibited the committee from such.  Eventually, Huebsch refused to answer by citing the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]], Fifth, [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth]], and [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth]] Amendments of the [[United States Constitution]], at which point the committee dismissed him.<ref name=Hearing1953/>\n\nThe ''New York Times'' noted Huebsch's \"verbal jousting\" with HUAC and that committee members called him \"contemptuous.\"<ref>\n{{cite news\n| first = Gladwin\n| last = Hill\n| title = Witness Bickers with Red Inquiry; House Members Call Screen Writer 'Contemptuous' -- He Refuses to Give Replies\n| newspaper = New York Times\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1953/03/26/archives/witness-bickers-with-red-inquiry-house-members-call-screen-writer.html\n| page = 8\n| date = 26 March 1953\n| accessdate = 28 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Comeback===\n[[File:What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

They sent the screenwriter Eddie Huebsch to interview Foreman:  <blockquote> I was assigned by the Party to find out what Foreman's testimony was going to be.  I had lunch with him--he was doing ''[[High Noon]]'' at the time.  I sat for eleven hours with him. We went to Lucy's, the fanciest restaurant in Hollywood--across from [[Paramount Studios|Paramount]].  I could not get him to assert that he would take an anti-Communist position.  So I reported that he was an informer.  Nothing he has said then or since has convinced me I was wrong...  The main point is, Carl wouldn't tell the Commies to go fuck themselves...  I would have recommended expulsion.<ref name=Names/>  </small> </blockquote>     </blockquote>     In 1999, fellow screenwriter [[Bernard Gordon (writer)|Bernard Gordon]] recalled:    <blockquote> <small> An especially odious instance of this kind of hysteria occurred close to home at a meeting of the Screen Writers Guild in Hollywood.

Eddie ducked into the hall and saw the marshal was trying to follow him into the closed meeting.

Roberts described himself as a \"motion-picture writer\" who had worked in that business since 1936 for studios major (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Columbia, Universal) and minor (Monogram).  Roberts tried to explain to the committee that, \"It is very difficult for us to understand, but communism in Hollywood, as I have seen it, is on a purely local level.  It doesn't seem to go anywhere.\"  In 1938, Roberts first met [[Ben Barzman]]'s home, where members like [[John Howard Lawson]] asked him to join.  In late April or early May 1945, right after the death of [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (\"the death of liberalism in America\"), [[Bernard C. Schoenfeld]] got him to join.  Two or three other \"delegates\" came to visit Roberts after that, one of whom was Edward Huebsch.  These delegates, including Huebsch, persuaded him that \"The party was merely interested in the things that I was interested in, better conditions in the Screen Writers' Guild, better labor conditions in Hollywood, higher wages, and so forth, and in furthering Roosevelt's policies.\"  Roberts left the Party in 1946, but Huebsch came back to ask him to rejoin and support the  Conference of Studio Unions (CSU) strike (see \"[[Hollywood Black Friday]]\").<ref name=Hearing1952>\n{{cite book\n| title = Communist Infiltration of Hollywood Motion-picture Industry\n| publisher = US GPO\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=l-hRAQAAIAAJ\n| pages = 3530-3531 (recruitment), 3533 (magazine), 3535 (strike)\n| date = 20 May 1952\n| accessdate = 28 April 2020}}</ref>  \n[[File:Dalton_Trumbo_prison_1950.jpg|thumb|right|Huebsch's colleagues included [[Dalton Trumbo]] (from mugshot dated 1950-06-09 at the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Ashland]])]]\nRoberts then went on the name Huebsch as a member of Communist-dominated groups in Hollywood:\n* Screen Writers Guild:  [[Ben Barzman]], [[John Howard Lawson]], [[Bernard C.

Esterman.  Initially, Huebsch objected to the televising of hearings by Congress, a point to which the committee acceded and rescheduled his hearing.  On March 24, 1953, David A. Lang, a fellow screen writer, named Huebsch as part of a Communist cell whose members also included: [[George Bassman]], Nick Bela, [[Edward Biberman]], [[Henry Blankfort]], Laurie Blankfort, William Blowitz, [[Hugo Butler]], Howard Dimsdale, Morton Grant, [[Lester Koenig]], [[Millard Lampell]], Pauline Lagerfin, [[Isobel Lennart]], [[Al Levitt]], [[Arnold Manoff]], [[Mortimer Offner]], W.L. River, Bob Robert, [[Marguerite Roberts]], [[John Stanford]], Wilma Shore, George Sklar, [[Bess Taffel]], [[Seymour Bennett]], Eunice Mindlin, and Val Burton.  Lang also described a \"Writers' Clinic\" to which many Hollywood Ten writers belonged.  On March 25, 1953, Huebsch returned for testimony, this time counseled not only by Esterman but also Daniel G. Marshall.  Huebsch began by correcting the committee, saying he had not asked for no televisions but for a quashing of his subpoena.  The committee disregarded his request but assured him he was not being recorded.  After a short biography, the committee pressed him to state whether he had ever been a member of the [[Communist Party USA]].  Huebsch declined to answer, citing the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].  The committee pressed him by demanding he cite which provision of the Fifth Amendment, etc.  Huebsch was equally aggressive, calling committee chairman [[Harold Velde]] \"King Harold Velde\" (in reference to [[King George III]]).  When the committee tried to press Huebsch into strictly \"yes\" or \"no\" answers, Huebsch cited a passage in the Fifth Amendment that prohibited the committee from such.  Eventually, Huebsch refused to answer by citing the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]], Fifth, [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth]], and [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth]] Amendments of the [[United States Constitution]], at which point the committee dismissed him.<ref name=Hearing1953/>\n\nThe ''New York Times'' noted Huebsch's \"verbal jousting\" with HUAC and that committee members called him \"contemptuous.\"<ref>\n{{cite news\n| first = Gladwin\n| last = Hill\n| title = Witness Bickers with Red Inquiry; House Members Call Screen Writer 'Contemptuous' -- He Refuses to Give Replies\n| newspaper = New York Times\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1953/03/26/archives/witness-bickers-with-red-inquiry-house-members-call-screen-writer.html\n| page = 8\n| date = 26 March 1953\n| accessdate = 28 April 2020}}</ref> \n\n===Comeback===\n[[File:What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?

They sent the screenwriter Eddie Huebsch to interview Foreman:  <blockquote> I was assigned by the Party to find out what Foreman's testimony was going to be.  I had lunch with him--he was doing ''[[High Noon]]'' at the time.  I sat for eleven hours with him. We went to Lucy's, the fanciest restaurant in Hollywood--across from [[Paramount Studios|Paramount]].  I could not get him to assert that he would take an anti-Communist position.  So I reported that he was an informer.  Nothing he has said then or since has convinced me I was wrong...  The main point is, Carl wouldn't tell the Commies to go fuck themselves...

Eddie ducked into the hall and saw the marshal was trying to follow him into the closed meeting.  Eddie immediately asked the chair to have the marshal barred, because only member of the guild were permitted.

Aalborg became the regional trade center for northern [[Jutland]]. The [[Lindholm H\u00f8je]] at [[N\u00f8rresundby]] across the Limfjord  features a notable [[Viking Era]] burial site indicating that this was a populated area of Denmark long before the town appeared on the fjord.\n\nChristian missionaries probably arrived sometime in the 9th century since nearby Viborg and Aarhus have evidence of Christian activity.  In 948 Denmark was divided into dioceses and Aalborg in time fell under the [[Ancient Diocese of Viborg|See of Viborg]].  Of the earliest churches in Aalborg no trace remains.  They would have been constructed of timber and been very small.  Many times stone churches were built on the same location as the first churches, but direct evidence of an earlier [[Viking Era]] church has not been found.\n\nIn the crypt of Budofi Cathedral visitors can see the remains of the large stones used for the original church that was built at the direction of Bishop Eskil of Viborg no later than 1132.  The first church was much smaller than the current church since it was a parish church.  It consisted of a short nave and choir built in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style.  That means it had half-round arches supporting a flat timber ceiling.\n\nThe existing Budolfi Cathedral (Danish:''Budolfi Domkirke'') was built in the last decades of the 14th century over and around the original St Budolfi Church and was listed for the first time in the Atlas of Denmark in 1399.  The church was named after [[St. Botolph]], an [[Anglo-Saxon Christianity| Anglo-Saxon]] abbot and saint.  His reputation as a learned and holy man in [[Anglo-Saxon England]] and as the patron saint of farmers and sailors made him a popular saint in pre-[[Reformation in Denmark|Reformation]] Denmark.  His remains were venerated at [[Westminster Abbey]], Ely, and Thornley Abbey.  No references are made to relics of St. Botolphus at Aalborg, but it was not uncommon for churches to be named after the relics of the most famous person the church possessed.  Other churches in Denmark and southern Sweden have also been named after him including  [[St Bodil's Church]] on [[Bornholm]], using other forms of the name Botolph.<ref name=\"Kirkens\">\"Kirkens Historie\" Aalborg Domkirke@www.aalborgdomkirke.dk</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.st-botolphs.com/botolph/st_botolph_life.htm   |title=   St Botolph|publisher =St Botolph, His Life and Times    \n|author=  Professor Kenneth Keenan |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe church was constructed in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style out of Denmark's most common building material, large bricks.   The nave and choir measure at present {{convert|56|m|ft|abbr=off}} in length and {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide, exclusive of the weapons porch and extensions.<ref name=\"Kirkens\" />\n\nAalborg was the center of [[Count's Feud|Skipper Clement's Rebellion]] of 1534.  Clement Andersen, known as [[Skipper Clement]], led the peasants and a few nobles of Vendsyssel in a peasant uprising that spread throughout Jutland. The peasants were trying to influence the selection of the next King of Denmark after the death of [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederik I]].  The abrupt truce with [[L\u00fcbeck]] freed up royal troops who chased the peasants all the way back to the walls of Aalborg.  The royalist troops stormed the gates and commenced the sack and bloody slaughter of the rebels and citizens of the town.  Just two years later Denmark became officially [[Lutheran]]. Due to its rural character and distance from Copenhagen, northern Denmark held onto elements of its [[Roman Catholic]] past longer than other parts of Denmark.  In 1554 Aalborg was made a diocese and after consideration  Budolfi Church was made the seat of the Bishop of Aalborg.\n\nBy the late-17th century two other churches in old town Aalborg, Our Lady's Church (Danish:''Vor Frue Kirke'') and the Abbey Church (Danish:''Klosterkirken''), were deemed to be superfluous for the few thousand residents of Aalborg.  Our Lady Church, the oldest of the three, was determined to be unstable, and it was torn down.  By 1800 the Abbey Church and tower were dismantled, and the stone was used to expand nearby [[Aalborghus|Aalborg Castle]] (Danish: ''Aalborghus'').  Budolfi Cathedral's tower is the only one of the original three church towers that are visible on the Aalborg city logo.<ref name=\"Kirkens\" />\n\nThe tower was added to the west front in 1779 with funds given by Jacob and Elisabeth Himmerig.  The square {{convert|28|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} brick tower is topped with a {{convert|35|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} metallic Baroque cupola and spire.  Four identical clock faces were installed on each of the four sides of the tower in 1817.  The south side has a sundial mounted on it as well.  The tower houses four bells.  The oldest cast in 1681 by Rudolph Melchior.  The largest bell was cast by B. L\u00f8w and Son in 1892.  A third bell was cast in 1926 by  DeSmithske foundry.  The latest addition was the 1979 bell from Royal Bellfounders [[Petit & Fritsen]].\n<ref>\"Kirkeklokker i Danmark.\"www.hikuin.dk</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.towerbells.org/data/IXfoundryDeSmithske.html |title= Index to carillons and chimes by DeSmithske\n|publisher =   towerbells.org|author=   5 June 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.towerbells.org/data/IXfoundryPetitFritsen.html|title= Index to carillons and chimes by Petit & Fritsen|publisher =   towerbells.org\n|author=    24 July 2018|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1899 a sacristy was built onto the north side aisle.\n\nDuring 1942 and 1943 the choir was extended 14 meters and the ceiling vaulting raised. A chapel was also added to the north side.\n\n== Interior ==\nThe main altar piece was added in 1684, a gift of Niels Jespersen and his wife Margareta Erichsdatter.  It was carved by Lauridtz Jensen of [[Essenb\u00e6k Abbey]] near Randers.  He also carved the pulpit.  The altar was restored in 1980.  The altar candelabras were given by Jens Christense and his wife, Mette Christensdatter, in 1686.  Budolfi Cathedral received the gift of an altar carving from c. 1450 which is placed in the north [[transept]].  It came from the estate chapel of Holckershavn also known as Elleborg in southern Jutland.\n\nThe black and white marble [[baptismal font]] was given to the church in 1728, a gift of the widow Maren Grotum Von Pentz.\n\nThe pulpit (1692) was a gift from the first apothecary at [[Jens Bang's House]] in Aalborg, Johannes Friedenreich and his wife, Magdalena Calow.  It was carved by Lauridtz Jensen.\n\nThe ornate Baroque organ fa\u00e7ade was constructed for the Hartvig Jochum M\u00fcller organ in 1749.  The organ has been restored and expanded several times, the latest in 1959 by [[Frobenius Orgelbyggeri|Th. Frobenius & Sons]].\n\nSeveral epitaphs have been preserved as examples of what once lined the aisles of the church.  The 1583 epitaph for Karine Hansdatter is a fine example of renaissance work.  The epitaphs for Jacob and Elizabeth Himmerig in 1773 and 1774 are examples of [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] design and commemorate the churches greatest benefactors.\n<gallery>\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_tarn.JPG|Tower\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_doebefonten.JPG|Baptismal font\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_kirkeskib.JPG|Interior\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_krucifikset.JPG|Crucifix\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_orgelet.JPG|Organ\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_praedikestolen.JPG|Pulpit\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.aalborgdomkirke.dk/ Official website]\n\n{{coord|57|02|52|N|9|55|10|E|region:DK_type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Aalborg}}\n{{Cathedrals of the Church of Denmark}}\n{{commons|Budolfi Kirke}}\n\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Lutheran cathedrals in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Pre-Reformation Roman Catholic cathedrals]]\n[[Category:Lutheran churches converted from Roman Catholicism]]\n[[Category:History of Aalborg]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Aalborg]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Aalborg]]\n[[Category:Churches in the North Denmark Region]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Aalborg church.JPG|right|thumb|Budolfi Church|250px]]\n\n'''Budolfi Church''' (''Budolfi Kirke'') is the [[cathedral church]] for the [[Lutheran]] [[Diocese of Aalborg]] in north [[Jutland]], [[Denmark]].\n<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.aalborgdomkirke.dk/UserFiles/file/ENG_12s_A5_Budolfi_4f_300609_LOW.pdf |title= Aalborg Cathedral \u2013 Church of St. Budolf\n|publisher =  aalborgdomkirke |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Aalborg D\u00e4nemark Sct.

Other churches in Denmark and southern Sweden have also been named after him including  [[St Bodil's Church]] on [[Bornholm]], using other forms of the name Botolph.<ref name=\"Kirkens\">\"Kirkens Historie\" Aalborg Domkirke@www.aalborgdomkirke.dk</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.st-botolphs.com/botolph/st_botolph_life.htm   |title=   St Botolph|publisher =St Botolph, His Life and Times    \n|author=  Professor Kenneth Keenan |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe church was constructed in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style out of Denmark's most common building material, large bricks.   The nave and choir measure at present {{convert|56|m|ft|abbr=off}} in length and {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=off}} wide, exclusive of the weapons porch and extensions.<ref name=\"Kirkens\" />\n\nAalborg was the center of [[Count's Feud|Skipper Clement's Rebellion]] of 1534.  Clement Andersen, known as [[Skipper Clement]], led the peasants and a few nobles of Vendsyssel in a peasant uprising that spread throughout Jutland. The peasants were trying to influence the selection of the next King of Denmark after the death of [[Frederick I of Denmark|Frederik I]].  The abrupt truce with [[L\u00fcbeck]] freed up royal troops who chased the peasants all the way back to the walls of Aalborg.  The royalist troops stormed the gates and commenced the sack and bloody slaughter of the rebels and citizens of the town.  Just two years later Denmark became officially [[Lutheran]]. Due to its rural character and distance from Copenhagen, northern Denmark held onto elements of its [[Roman Catholic]] past longer than other parts of Denmark.  In 1554 Aalborg was made a diocese and after consideration  Budolfi Church was made the seat of the Bishop of Aalborg.\n\nBy the late-17th century two other churches in old town Aalborg, Our Lady's Church (Danish:''Vor Frue Kirke'') and the Abbey Church (Danish:''Klosterkirken''), were deemed to be superfluous for the few thousand residents of Aalborg.  Our Lady Church, the oldest of the three, was determined to be unstable, and it was torn down.  By 1800 the Abbey Church and tower were dismantled, and the stone was used to expand nearby [[Aalborghus|Aalborg Castle]] (Danish: ''Aalborghus'').  Budolfi Cathedral's tower is the only one of the original three church towers that are visible on the Aalborg city logo.<ref name=\"Kirkens\" />\n\nThe tower was added to the west front in 1779 with funds given by Jacob and Elisabeth Himmerig.  The square {{convert|28|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} brick tower is topped with a {{convert|35|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off}} metallic Baroque cupola and spire.  Four identical clock faces were installed on each of the four sides of the tower in 1817.  The south side has a sundial mounted on it as well.  The tower houses four bells.  The oldest cast in 1681 by Rudolph Melchior.  The largest bell was cast by B. L\u00f8w and Son in 1892.  A third bell was cast in 1926 by  DeSmithske foundry.  The latest addition was the 1979 bell from Royal Bellfounders [[Petit & Fritsen]].\n<ref>\"Kirkeklokker i Danmark.\"www.hikuin.dk</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.towerbells.org/data/IXfoundryDeSmithske.html |title= Index to carillons and chimes by DeSmithske\n|publisher =   towerbells.org|author=   5 June 2017|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.towerbells.org/data/IXfoundryPetitFritsen.html|title= Index to carillons and chimes by Petit & Fritsen|publisher =   towerbells.org\n|author=    24 July 2018|accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1899 a sacristy was built onto the north side aisle.\n\nDuring 1942 and 1943 the choir was extended 14 meters and the ceiling vaulting raised. A chapel was also added to the north side.\n\n== Interior ==\nThe main altar piece was added in 1684, a gift of Niels Jespersen and his wife Margareta Erichsdatter.  It was carved by Lauridtz Jensen of [[Essenb\u00e6k Abbey]] near Randers.  He also carved the pulpit.  The altar was restored in 1980.  The altar candelabras were given by Jens Christense and his wife, Mette Christensdatter, in 1686.  Budolfi Cathedral received the gift of an altar carving from c. 1450 which is placed in the north [[transept]].  It came from the estate chapel of Holckershavn also known as Elleborg in southern Jutland.\n\nThe black and white marble [[baptismal font]] was given to the church in 1728, a gift of the widow Maren Grotum Von Pentz.\n\nThe pulpit (1692) was a gift from the first apothecary at [[Jens Bang's House]] in Aalborg, Johannes Friedenreich and his wife, Magdalena Calow.  It was carved by Lauridtz Jensen.\n\nThe ornate Baroque organ fa\u00e7ade was constructed for the Hartvig Jochum M\u00fcller organ in 1749.  The organ has been restored and expanded several times, the latest in 1959 by [[Frobenius Orgelbyggeri|Th. Frobenius & Sons]].\n\nSeveral epitaphs have been preserved as examples of what once lined the aisles of the church.  The 1583 epitaph for Karine Hansdatter is a fine example of renaissance work.  The epitaphs for Jacob and Elizabeth Himmerig in 1773 and 1774 are examples of [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] design and commemorate the churches greatest benefactors.\n<gallery>\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_tarn.JPG|Tower\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_doebefonten.JPG|Baptismal font\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_kirkeskib.JPG|Interior\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_krucifikset.JPG|Crucifix\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_orgelet.JPG|Organ\nFile:Aalborg_budolfi_domkirke_praedikestolen.JPG|Pulpit\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.aalborgdomkirke.dk/ Official website]\n\n{{coord|57|02|52|N|9|55|10|E|region:DK_type:landmark|display=title}}\n{{Aalborg}}\n{{commons|Budolfi Kirke}}\n\n[[Category:Cathedrals in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Lutheran cathedrals in Denmark]]\n[[Category:Pre-Reformation Roman Catholic cathedrals]]\n[[Category:Lutheran churches converted from Roman Catholicism]]\n[[Category:History of Aalborg]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Aalborg]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Aalborg]]\n[[Category:Churches in the North Denmark Region]]\n", "name_user": "Carsten R D", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budolfi_Church"}

On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the [[flag of England]], a red cross on a white background, known as ''[[St George's Cross]]'', and the [[flag of Scotland]], a white saltire (X-shaped cross) on a blue background known as the ''[[Saltire]]'' or ''[[St Andrew's Cross]]'', would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.\n\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the [[Act of Union 1800|union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1801.<ref name=\"flaginst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=7 |title=British flags |first=Graham |last=Bartram |website=The Flag Institute |accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of [[St George]] for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of [[St Andrew]] for [[Scotland]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|red saltire]] of [[St Patrick]] to represent [[Ireland]].\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Union Flag and St Georges Cross.jpg|thumb|The Union Jack flying beside Saint George's Cross]]\n[[File:HMS Cornwall F99 July 2006.jpg|thumb|{{HMS|Cornwall|F99|6}}, \"dressed\" on the occasion of her official visit to the port of [[Zeebrugge]], [[Belgium]], in 2006, and flying the Union Jack from the jackstaff]]\nThe terms ''Union Jack'' and ''Union Flag'' are both used historically for describing the national flag of the United Kingdom.

The term ''Union Jack'' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702\u201314), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603.

Its original [[blazon]], as decreed by [[George III of the United Kingdom]] on 1 January 1801, reads: \n<blockquote>\"the Union flag shall be azure, the crosses-saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick quartered per saltire counter changed argent and gules; the latter fimbriated of the second  [viz., argent]; surmounted by the cross of St. George of the third [viz., gules], fimbriated as the saltire [viz., argent].\"<ref>{{cite book|title=The European Magazine: And London Review|volume=39|publisher=Philological Society of London|year=1801|page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qV83AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA74}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Specification===\n[[File:United Kingdom Flag Specifications.svg|350px|right|Diagram of the Union Flag's design]]\nThe Union Jack is normally twice as long as it is tall, a ratio of 1:2. In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but 1:2 is for most purposes. In 2008, MP [[Andrew Rosindell]] proposed a [[Ten Minute Rule]] bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/unionflag.html |accessdate=2014-04-09 |title=Union Flag Bill 2007\u201308 |publisher=UK Parliament}}</ref>\n\nFlags that have the Union Jack in the canton should always be 1:2 to preserve the square fly area.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe three-component crosses that make up the Union Flag are sized as follows:\n* The red [[St George's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|5}} of the flag's height with a {{frac|1|15}} flag height [[fimbriation]]\n* The white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] width is {{frac|6|30}} of the flag's height, visible on either side of the St Patrick's Cross in diagonals of  {{frac|3|30}} and {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height, respectively.\n* The red diagonal [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height. It is offset by {{frac|3|30}} of the flag's height in an anti-clockwise direction. According to the official blazon of 1801, the white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] is in fact [[counterchanged]] with the red diagonal of  [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]]. In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is  {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height, with fimbriations of  {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height on either side of the red saltire.\n\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's ''height'' whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.<ref>by the 1970s,<!--this article is unaware  *when* this became standard, could be any time between 1801 and 1973.--> \"its current official dimension of l/30th the width of the flag\" ''The Flag Bulletin'', Volumes 12-14, Flag Research Center (1973), p. 85.</ref> In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.<ref>[https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-worlds-most-expensive-union-jack-sells-for-384k The World\u2019s Most Expensive Union Jack Sells For \u00a3384K]</ref>\n\n===Colours===\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:<ref name=Flagsofworld />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\n\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is ''above'' the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases ''wide white top'' and ''broadside up''.\n\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the [[red ensign]] (also to be used as a red jack by [[privateer]]s).  As it appears in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\" />\n\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertently\u2014even on commercially-made hand waving flags.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]].

It was then adopted by land forces as well, although the blue field used on land-based versions more closely resembled that of the blue of the flag of Scotland.\n\nVarious shades of blue have been used in the saltire over the years. The ground of the current Union Flag is a deep \"[[navy blue|navy]]\" blue ([[Pantone]] 280), which can be traced to the colour used for the [[Blue Ensign]] of the [[Royal Navy]]'s historic \"Blue Squadron\". (Dark shades of colour were used on [[maritime flags]] on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the [[Scottish Parliament]] recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \"[[royal blue|royal]]\" blue, (Pantone 300). (The Office of the [[Lord Lyon]] does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry.)\n\nA thin white stripe, or [[fimbriation]], separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's [[rule of tincture]] where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. ''[[argent]]'' or silver). The [[blazon]] for the old union flag, to be compared with the current flag, is ''azure, the cross saltire of St Andrew argent surmounted by the Cross of St George gules, fimbriated of the second.''\n\n[[Wales]] had no explicit recognition in the Union Jack as it had been a part of the Kingdom of England since being annexed by [[Edward I of England]] in 1282 and its full integration by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]], and was therefore represented by the flag of England.<ref name=\"KnowBritain\"/>\n[[File:Flag of the Commonwealth (1658-1660).svg|thumb|alt=Red cross with a white border over a white saltire and dark blue background.

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that on 22 January 1922:\n\n{{quote|text=At the College of Arms it was stated that certain modifications were under consideration and that if any action were taken it would be done by the King in Council.

It was then estimated that the alteration would cost at least \u00a32,000,000. To remove all reference to Ireland from the present Union Jack and Royal Arms would be vastly more expensive.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/01/14/109830879.pdf |title=May Alter The Union Jack |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 January 1922 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>}}\n\nThere was some speculation on the matter in British dominions also, with one New Zealand paper reporting that:\n{{quote|text=...the removal of the cross of St. Patrick Cross after 120 years will transform the appearance of the flag. It will certainly become a flag under which great victories were won in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but to most minds the sentimental loss will be great.

A compromise was reached in which both flags were flown on official buildings.

Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included [[Aden]], [[Basutoland]] (now Lesotho), [[Barbados]], [[Borneo]], [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[Canada]], [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka), [[British Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Dominica]], [[British East Africa|British East Africa (Kenya Colony)]], [[Gambia]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast (Ghana)]], [[Grenada]], [[British Guiana|Guiana]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]], [[Labuan|Labuan (Malaysia)]], [[Lagos]], [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], [[British Mauritius|Mauritius]], [[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Penang|Penang (Malaysia)]], [[Southern Rhodesia|Rhodesia]], [[Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate|Sierra Leone]], [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]], [[British Somaliland|Somaliland]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[British Raj|Pre-partitioned India]] (present-day [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]]), [[Tanganyika]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]], the [[United States]], and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]]. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Dependent Territory of Hong Kong]] was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of [[Flag of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] (other than the government ensign). The [[Crown Dependencies]] are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special [[ensign]] in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910)]]\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and [[Tuvalu]], which have retained the monarchy; and [[Fiji]], which [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|abolished the monarchy in 1987]].\n\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the [[United Empire Loyalists]] Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|title=History of the Loyalist Flag|publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=www.uelac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923234311/http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|archive-date=23 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the national flag, many other [[List of Australian flags|Australian]] flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the [[Australian Red Ensign]] (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower [[Murray River Flag]]s. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the [[Flags Act 1953]] states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.\n\nThe [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country's]] flag, the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]], is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between [[Bilbao]] and Britain at the time the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]] was designed in 1894. The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the [[Mosquito Coast]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Hawaii.svg|thumb|right|alt=Thin red white and blue horizontal stripes with Union Flag as top-left quarter.|''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'', or the [[flag of Hawaii]]]]\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the [[Grand Union Flag]]. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the [[British East India Company]]. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its [[Flag of Hawaii|state flag]]. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, [[George Vancouver]], during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\n\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the [[flag of Baton Rouge]], the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], used a [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|flag]] with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on October 19, 1974.  Likewise, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.<ref>{{FOTW|id=us-pa-wc|title=Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania (U.S.)}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910\u20131928 and 1928\u20131994 [[South African Flag#History|flags]] of South Africa. The [[South Africa Red Ensign|1910\u20131928 flag]] was a [[red ensign]] with the [[Coat of arms of South Africa (1910\u20132000)|Union coat of arms]] in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the [[Prinsenvlag]] and commonly known as the ''oranje-blanje-blou'' (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two [[Boer republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\n\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield close to the flags of the United States and [[Second French Empire|France]], there was also contained the [[flag of Prussia]], but it was removed around 1917.\n\nThe flag of the [[Chile]]an city of [[Coquimbo]] features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\n\n<!-- this gallery is for examples (not an exhaustive list) of current usages of the Union Jack at country, province/state or city level -->\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of New Zealand.svg|The [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|Flag of Tuvalu.svg|The [[flag of Tuvalu]]\n|Flag of the Cook Islands.svg|The [[flag of the Cook Islands]]\n|Flag of Fiji.svg|The [[flag of Fiji]]\n|Flag of Queensland.svg|The [[Queensland]] State flag\n|Flag of British Columbia.svg|The [[flag of British Columbia|flag of the Province of British Columbia]], [[Canada]]\n|Flag of Ontario.svg|The flag of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]], Canada\n|Flag_of_Manitoba.svg|The [[Flag of Manitoba|flag]] of the Province of [[Manitoba]], Canada\n|Flag of Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg|The [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|flag]] of the Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada\n|Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory.svg|The [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]\n|Flag of Bermuda.svg|The [[flag of Bermuda]]\n|Flag of the Falkland Islands.svg|The flag of the [[Falkland Islands]]\n|Flag of Niue.svg|The [[flag of Niue]]\n|Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts.svg|The flag of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]\n|Flag of Baton Rouge.svg|The [[flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]\n|Flag of Coquimbo.svg|The flag of [[Coquimbo]], [[Chile]]\n|British Raj Red Ensign.svg|The [[flag of British India]] (1885\u20131947)\n|Grand Union Flag.svg|The flag of the [[United States]] (1775\u20131777) later named the [[Grand Union Flag]]\n|Flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands.svg|The [[flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands]] (1815\u20131864)\n|Flag of the Tamatave Kingdom (1826-1828).svg|The flag of the [[Tamatave|Tamatave Kingdom]] (1822\u20131828)\n|Flag of the Cook Islands Federation.svg|The flag of the [[Cook Islands Federation]] (1893\u20131901)\n|Flag of British Heligoland.svg|The flag of [[Heligoland#19th century|British Heligoland]] (1807\u20131890)\n|British Weihaiwei flag.svg|The [[flag of Weihaiwei]] (1903\u20131930)\n|Flag of Cyprus (1922\u20131960).svg|The flag of [[British Cyprus]] (1922\u20131960)\n|Flag of Malta (1943\u20131964).svg|1943 version of the [[flag of Malta]] until 1964\n|Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|1957 version of the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Canadian civil ensign]], used until 1965\n|Flag of Trinidad and Tobago (1958\u20131962).svg|The [[flag of Trinidad and Tobago|flag of British Trinidad and Tobago]] (1958\u20131962)\n|Flag of Rhodesia (1964\u20131968).svg|The [[Flag of Southern Rhodesia#Rhodesia|flag of Rhodesia]] (1964\u20131968)\n|Flag of Singapore (1952\u20131959).svg|The [[flag of Singapore]] until 1959\n|Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|''Oranje-blanje-blou'', or the [[Flag of South Africa (1928\u20131994)|flag of South Africa]]  (1928\u20131994)\n|Flag_of_Hong_Kong_1959.svg|The [[flag of Hong Kong]] until 1997\n}}\n\n===Ensigns===\n{{Main|British ensigns}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011|reason=no refs}}\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the [[ensign]]s flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the [[White ensign]] (Royal Navy), the [[Red ensign]] (Merchant and private boats) or the [[Blue ensign]] (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as [[List of New Zealand flags#Ensigns|New Zealand]] and [[List of Australian flags#Military and naval flags|Australia]]) with the Union Flag in the canton.

It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book{{clarify |reason=What book? |date=September 2012}} issued to British [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the [[Red Ensign]] for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the [[Red Ensign]], the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced [[Red Ensign]]), no other colours.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/data.pdf |title=Merchant Shipping Act 1995 |website=UK Public General Acts |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=19 July 1995 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the [[de facto]] Civil Jack.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company]]\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag.

On 12 April 1606, a new flag to represent this regal union between England and Scotland was specified in a royal decree, according to which the [[flag of England]], a red cross on a white background, known as ''[[St George's Cross]]'', and the [[flag of Scotland]], a white saltire (X-shaped cross) on a blue background known as the ''[[Saltire]]'' or ''[[St Andrew's Cross]]'', would be joined together, forming the flag of England and Scotland for maritime purposes.\n\nThe present design of the Union Flag dates from a Royal proclamation following the [[Act of Union 1800|union]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] in 1801.<ref name=\"flaginst\">{{cite web |url=http://www.flaginstitute.org/index.php?location=7 |title=British flags |first=Graham |last=Bartram |website=The Flag Institute |accessdate=2007-05-02}}</ref> The flag combines aspects of three older national flags: the red cross of [[St George]] for the Kingdom of England, the white saltire of [[St Andrew]] for [[Scotland]] and the [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|red saltire]] of [[St Patrick]] to represent [[Ireland]].\n\nNotably, the [[Home Nations|home country]] of [[symbols of Wales|Wales is not represented separately]] in the Union Flag, as the flag was designed after the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I of England|invasion of Wales in 1282]]. Hence Wales as a home country has no representation on the flag.

The term ''Union Jack'' possibly dates from Queen Anne's time (r. 1702\u201314), but its origin is uncertain. It may come from the 'jack-et' of the English or Scottish soldiers, or from the name of James I who originated the first union in 1603. Even if the term \"Union Jack\" does derive from the jack flag, after three centuries, it is now sanctioned by use and has appeared in official use, confirmed as the national flag by Parliament and remains the popular term.<ref name=Flagsofworld>{{FOTW|id=gb|title=United Kingdom|accessdate=2008-06-10}}</ref>\n\nWinston Churchill was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1940 to 1945 and he referred to the flag of the United Kingdom as the Union Jack.

In the United Kingdom, land flags are normally a ratio of 3:5; the Union Jack can also be made in this shape, but 1:2 is for most purposes. In 2008, MP [[Andrew Rosindell]] proposed a [[Ten Minute Rule]] bill to standardise the design of the flag at 3:5, but the bill did not proceed past the first reading.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2007-08/unionflag.html |accessdate=2014-04-09 |title=Union Flag Bill 2007\u201308 |publisher=UK Parliament}}</ref>\n\nFlags that have the Union Jack in the canton should always be 1:2 to preserve the square fly area.{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe three-component crosses that make up the Union Flag are sized as follows:\n* The red [[St George's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|5}} of the flag's height with a {{frac|1|15}} flag height [[fimbriation]]\n* The white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] width is {{frac|6|30}} of the flag's height, visible on either side of the St Patrick's Cross in diagonals of  {{frac|3|30}} and {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height, respectively.\n* The red diagonal [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]] width is {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height. It is offset by {{frac|3|30}} of the flag's height in an anti-clockwise direction. According to the official blazon of 1801, the white diagonal [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's Cross]] is in fact [[counterchanged]] with the red diagonal of  [[Saint Patrick's Saltire|St Patrick's Cross]]. In this interpretation, the width of both saltires is  {{frac|1|15}} of the flag's height, with fimbriations of  {{frac|1|30}} of the flag's height on either side of the red saltire.\n\nThe crosses and fimbriations retain their thickness relative to the flag's ''height'' whether they are shown with a ratio of 3:5 or 1:2.\n\nThe Admiralty in 1864 settled all official flags at proportions of 1:2, but the relative widths of the crosses remained unspecified, with the above conventions becoming standardised in the 20th century.<ref>by the 1970s,<!--this article is unaware  *when* this became standard, could be any time between 1801 and 1973.--> \"its current official dimension of l/30th the width of the flag\" ''The Flag Bulletin'', Volumes 12-14, Flag Research Center (1973), p. 85.</ref> In the 19th century, the Union flag was defined by the same blazon but could vary in its geometrical proportions.<ref>[https://www.justcollecting.com/miscellania/the-worlds-most-expensive-union-jack-sells-for-384k The World\u2019s Most Expensive Union Jack Sells For \u00a3384K]</ref>\n\n===Colours===\nThe colour specifications for the colours Union Jack (royal) blue, Union Flag red and white are:<ref name=Flagsofworld />\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

Thus, there is a right side up.  The original specification of the Union Flag in the Royal Proclamation of 1 January 1801 did not contain a drawn pattern or express which way the saltires should lie; they were simply \"counterchanged\" and the red saltire fimbriated. Nevertheless, a convention was soon established which accords most closely with the description.\n\nWhen statically displayed, the hoist is on the observer's left. To fly the flag correctly, the white of St Andrew is ''above'' the red of St Patrick in the upper hoist canton (the quarter at the top nearest to the flag-pole). This is expressed by the phrases ''wide white top'' and ''broadside up''.\n\nThe first drawn pattern for the flag was in a parallel proclamation on 1 January 1801, concerning civil naval ensigns, which drawing shows the [[red ensign]] (also to be used as a red jack by [[privateer]]s).  As it appears in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', the broad stripe is where expected for three of the four quarters, but the upper left quarter shows the broad stripe below.<ref name=\"London Gazette 1801-01-03\" />\n\nIt is often stated that a flag upside down is a form of distress signal or even a deliberate insult. In the case of the Union Flag, the difference is subtle and is easily missed by the uninformed. It is often displayed upside down inadvertently\u2014even on commercially-made hand waving flags.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nOn 3 February 2009, the BBC reported that the flag had been inadvertently flown upside-down by the UK government at the signing of a trade agreement with Chinese premier [[Wen Jiabao]].

(Dark shades of colour were used on [[maritime flags]] on the basis of durability.) In 2003 a committee of the [[Scottish Parliament]] recommended that the flag of Scotland use a lighter \"[[royal blue|royal]]\" blue, (Pantone 300). (The Office of the [[Lord Lyon]] does not detail specific shades of colour for use in heraldry.)\n\nA thin white stripe, or [[fimbriation]], separates the red cross from the blue field, in accordance with heraldry's [[rule of tincture]] where colours (like red and blue) must be separated from each other by metals (like white, i.e. ''[[argent]]'' or silver).

It will certainly become a flag under which great victories were won in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but to most minds the sentimental loss will be great.

A compromise was reached in which both flags were flown on official buildings.  The Union Nationality and Flags Act 1927 provided that the flags of the Union were (a) the Union Jack, to denote the association with the other members of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and (b) the new [[Flag of South Africa (1928-1994)|National Flag]].  The Union Jack was to be flown alongside the National Flag at the [[Parliament of South Africa|Houses of Parliament]], from the principal government buildings in the capitals, at Union ports, on government offices abroad, and at such other places as the government might determine.<ref name=unfa>Union Nationality and Flags Act 1927 (renamed 'Flags Act 1927' in 1949).</ref><ref name=sava>Radburn, A.

Nations and colonies that have used the Union Flag at some stage have included [[Aden]], [[Basutoland]] (now Lesotho), [[Barbados]], [[Borneo]], [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[Canada]], [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka), [[British Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Dominica]], [[British East Africa|British East Africa (Kenya Colony)]], [[Gambia]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast (Ghana)]], [[Grenada]], [[British Guiana|Guiana]], [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]], [[Labuan|Labuan (Malaysia)]], [[Lagos]], [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], [[British Mauritius|Mauritius]], [[Colonial Nigeria|Nigeria]], [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], [[Penang|Penang (Malaysia)]], [[Southern Rhodesia|Rhodesia]], [[Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate|Sierra Leone]], [[Colony of Singapore|Singapore]], [[British Somaliland|Somaliland]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], [[British Raj|Pre-partitioned India]] (present-day [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Myanmar]]), [[Tanganyika]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]], the [[United States]], and [[Weihaiwei under British rule|Weihaiwei]]. As former British Empire nations were granted independence, these and other versions of the Union Flag were decommissioned. The most recent decommissioning of the Union Flag came on 1 July 1997, when the former [[History of Colonial Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Dependent Territory of Hong Kong]] was handed over to the People's Republic of China.\n\nAll administrative regions and territories of the United Kingdom fly the Union Jack in some form, with the exception of [[Flag of Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] (other than the government ensign). The [[Crown Dependencies]] are legally not part of the United Kingdom, and the Union Jack is not an official flag there. Outside the UK, the Union Jack is usually part of a special [[ensign]] in which it is placed in the upper left hand corner of a blue field, with a signifying crest in the bottom right.\n\n[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910)]]\nFour former British colonies in Oceania which are now independent countries incorporate the Union Jack as part of their national flags: Australia, New Zealand and [[Tuvalu]], which have retained the monarchy; and [[Fiji]], which [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|abolished the monarchy in 1987]].\n\nIn former British colonies, the Union Jack was used interchangeably with informal flags of the territory for significant parts of their colonial early history. The Union Flag was used as the flag of Canada until it was re-adopted as a ceremonial flag, and the Maple Leaf flag made the official national flag in 1965. In addition to being an official ceremonial flag, the Union Flag also defaces the flags of a number of Canadian provinces, including [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]]. [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] uses a flag that was derived from the Union Flag, with the Union Jack serving as the flag of Newfoundland until 1980. The Union Flag, and flags defaced with the Union Flag in its canton, like the Canadian Red Ensign, continue to see use in Canada in a private capacity. The pre-1801 Union Flag also sees limited use by private organizations, most notably the [[United Empire Loyalists]] Association of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|title=History of the Loyalist Flag|publisher=United Empire Loyalists Association of Canada|accessdate=18 March 2020|website=www.uelac.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190923234311/http://www.uelac.org/Loyalist-Monuments/Loyalist-Flag.php|archive-date=23 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the national flag, many other [[List of Australian flags|Australian]] flags retain the use of the Union Jack, including the [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]] (also known as the Australian White Ensign), the [[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]], the [[Australian Red Ensign]] (for use by merchant and private vessels), and the [[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]. The flags of all six Australian States retain the Union Jack in the canton, as do some regional flags such as the Upper and Lower [[Murray River Flag]]s. The Vice-Regal flags of the State Governors also use the Union Jack. While the [[Flags Act 1953]] states that Australians still have the \"right or privilege\" to fly the Union Jack after the introduction of the Australian National Flag, usage of the Union Jack by itself is unusual.\n\nThe [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country's]] flag, the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]], is also loosely based on the Union Jack, reflecting the significant commercial ties between [[Bilbao]] and Britain at the time the [[Ikurri\u00f1a]] was designed in 1894. The [[Miskito people|Miskito]] people sometimes use a similar flag that also incorporates the Union Jack in its canton, due to long periods of contact in the [[Mosquito Coast]].\n\n[[File:Flag of Hawaii.svg|thumb|right|alt=Thin red white and blue horizontal stripes with Union Flag as top-left quarter.|''Ka Hae Hawai{{okina}}i'', or the [[flag of Hawaii]]]]\nThe Union Jack was used by the United States in its first flag, the [[Grand Union Flag]]. This flag was of a similar design to the one used by the [[British East India Company]]. Hawaii, a state of the United States but located in the central Pacific, incorporates the Union Jack in its [[Flag of Hawaii|state flag]]. According to one story, the King of Hawaii asked the British mariner, [[George Vancouver]], during a stop in Lahaina, what the piece of cloth flying from his ship was. Vancouver replied that it represented his king's authority. The Hawaiian king then adopted and flew the flag as a symbol of his own royal authority not recognising its national derivation. Hawaii's flag represents the only current use of the Union Jack in any American state flag.\n\nAlso in the United States, the Union Flag of 1606 is incorporated into the [[flag of Baton Rouge]], the capital city of Louisiana. Baton Rouge was a British colony from the time of the [[Seven Years' War]] until the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when it was captured by Spanish forces. Symbols from the colonial powers France and Spain are also incorporated into the Baton Rouge flag. [[Taunton, Massachusetts]], used a [[Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts|flag]] with the old style Union Flag by a resolution on October 19, 1974.  Likewise, [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania]], has been known to fly a flag containing the King's Colours since 1973.<ref>{{FOTW|id=us-pa-wc|title=Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania (U.S.)}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Jack also appeared on both the 1910\u20131928 and 1928\u20131994 [[South African Flag#History|flags]] of South Africa. The [[South Africa Red Ensign|1910\u20131928 flag]] was a [[red ensign]] with the [[Coat of arms of South Africa (1910\u20132000)|Union coat of arms]] in the fly. The 1928\u20131994 flag, based on the [[Prinsenvlag]] and commonly known as the ''oranje-blanje-blou'' (orange-white-blue), contained the Union Jack as part of a central motif at par with the flags of the two [[Boer republics]] of the [[Orange Free State]] and [[South African Republic|Transvaal]]. To keep any one of the three flags from having precedence, the Union Jack is spread horizontally from the Orange Free State flag towards the hoist; closest to the hoist, it is in the superior position but since it is reversed it does not precede the other flags.\n\nThe flag of the Municipal Council of [[Shanghai International Settlement]] in 1869 contained multiple flags to symbolize the countries have participated in the creation and management of this enclave in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The Union Jack was contained as part of top left hand shield close to the flags of the United States and [[Second French Empire|France]], there was also contained the [[flag of Prussia]], but it was removed around 1917.\n\nThe flag of the [[Chile]]an city of [[Coquimbo]] features the Union Jack, owing to its historical commercial links to Britain.\n\n<!-- this gallery is for examples (not an exhaustive list) of current usages of the Union Jack at country, province/state or city level -->\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Flag of New Zealand.svg|The [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|Flag of Tuvalu.svg|The [[flag of Tuvalu]]\n|Flag of the Cook Islands.svg|The [[flag of the Cook Islands]]\n|Flag of Fiji.svg|The [[flag of Fiji]]\n|Flag of Queensland.svg|The [[Queensland]] State flag\n|Flag of British Columbia.svg|The [[flag of British Columbia|flag of the Province of British Columbia]], [[Canada]]\n|Flag of Ontario.svg|The flag of the [[Ontario|Province of Ontario]], Canada\n|Flag_of_Manitoba.svg|The [[Flag of Manitoba|flag]] of the Province of [[Manitoba]], Canada\n|Flag of Newfoundland_and_Labrador.svg|The [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|flag]] of the Province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], Canada\n|Flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory.svg|The [[flag of the British Indian Ocean Territory]]\n|Flag of Bermuda.svg|The [[flag of Bermuda]]\n|Flag of the Falkland Islands.svg|The flag of the [[Falkland Islands]]\n|Flag of Niue.svg|The [[flag of Niue]]\n|Flag of Taunton, Massachusetts.svg|The flag of [[Taunton, Massachusetts]]\n|Flag of Baton Rouge.svg|The [[flag of Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]\n|Flag of Coquimbo.svg|The flag of [[Coquimbo]], [[Chile]]\n|British Raj Red Ensign.svg|The [[flag of British India]] (1885\u20131947)\n|Grand Union Flag.svg|The flag of the [[United States]] (1775\u20131777) later named the [[Grand Union Flag]]\n|Flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands.svg|The [[flag of the United States of the Ionian Islands]] (1815\u20131864)\n|Flag of the Tamatave Kingdom (1826-1828).svg|The flag of the [[Tamatave|Tamatave Kingdom]] (1822\u20131828)\n|Flag of the Cook Islands Federation.svg|The flag of the [[Cook Islands Federation]] (1893\u20131901)\n|Flag of British Heligoland.svg|The flag of [[Heligoland#19th century|British Heligoland]] (1807\u20131890)\n|British Weihaiwei flag.svg|The [[flag of Weihaiwei]] (1903\u20131930)\n|Flag of Cyprus (1922\u20131960).svg|The flag of [[British Cyprus]] (1922\u20131960)\n|Flag of Malta (1943\u20131964).svg|1943 version of the [[flag of Malta]] until 1964\n|Canadian Red Ensign 1957-1965.svg|1957 version of the [[Canadian Red Ensign|Canadian civil ensign]], used until 1965\n|Flag of Trinidad and Tobago (1958\u20131962).svg|The [[flag of Trinidad and Tobago|flag of British Trinidad and Tobago]] (1958\u20131962)\n|Flag of Rhodesia (1964\u20131968).svg|The [[Flag of Southern Rhodesia#Rhodesia|flag of Rhodesia]] (1964\u20131968)\n|Flag of Singapore (1952\u20131959).svg|The [[flag of Singapore]] until 1959\n|Flag of South Africa 1928-1994.svg|''Oranje-blanje-blou'', or the [[Flag of South Africa (1928\u20131994)|flag of South Africa]]  (1928\u20131994)\n|Flag_of_Hong_Kong_1959.svg|The [[flag of Hong Kong]] until 1997\n}}\n\n===Ensigns===\n{{Main|British ensigns}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011|reason=no refs}}\nThe Union Flag can be found in the canton of several of the [[ensign]]s flown by vessels and aircraft of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories. These are used in cases where it is illegal to fly the Union Flag, such as at sea from a ship other than a British warship. Normal practice for British ships is to fly the [[White ensign]] (Royal Navy), the [[Red ensign]] (Merchant and private boats) or the [[Blue ensign]] (government departments and public corporations). Similar ensigns are used by other countries (such as [[List of New Zealand flags#Ensigns|New Zealand]] and [[List of Australian flags#Military and naval flags|Australia]]) with the Union Flag in the canton. Other Commonwealth countries (such as [[Indian Military Flags|India]] and [[List of Jamaican flags#Ensigns|Jamaica]]) may follow similar ensign etiquette as the UK, replacing the Union Flag with their own national flag.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Naval Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[White Ensign|Royal Navy White Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] [[Red Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal Air Force.svg|[[Royal Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[British Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Government Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|[[Blue Ensign]]\n|Flag of Her Majesty's Coastguard.png|[[HM Coastguard]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the British Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses.svg|Ensign of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]]\n|Civil Ensign of the Isle of Man.svg|[[Isle of Man]] Red Ensign\n|Government Ensign of Gibraltar.svg|Gibraltar State Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of the Cayman Islands.svg|[[Cayman Islands]] Red Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Royal Australian Navy]] Ensign\n|Ensign of the Royal Australian Air Force.svg|[[Royal Australian Air Force Ensign]]\n|Civil Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Red Ensign|Australian Civil Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of Australia.svg|[[Australian Civil Aviation Ensign]]\n|Civil Air Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[New Zealand Civil Air Ensign]]\n|Ensign of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of New Zealand.svg|[[Royal New Zealand Navy]] Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of New Zealand.svg|New Zealand Civil Ensign\n|Naval Ensign of Fiji.svg|[[Fiji|Fijian]] Naval Ensign\n|Civil Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Ensign\n|Civil Air Ensign of Fiji.svg|Fijian Civil Air Ensign\n}}\n\n===Pilot or Civil Jack===\n[[File:Civil Jack of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|alt=Union Flag with thick white border comprising about half of the area of the flag.|The Union Jack with a white border]]\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2011|reason=needs more refs}}\nThe flag in a white border occasionally seen on merchant ships was sometimes referred to as the '''Pilot Jack'''. It can be traced back to 1823 when it was created as a signal flag, never intended as a civil jack. A book{{clarify |reason=What book? |date=September 2012}} issued to British [[consul (representative)|consul]]s in 1855 states that the white bordered Union Flag is to be hoisted for a pilot. Although there was some ambiguity regarding the legality of it being flown for any other purpose on civilian vessels, its use as an ensign or jack was established well in advance of the 1864 Act that designated the [[Red Ensign]] for merchant shipping. In 1970, the white-bordered Union Flag ceased to be the signal for a pilot, but references to it as national colours were not removed from the current Merchant Shipping Act and it was legally interpreted as a flag that could be flown on a merchant ship, as a jack if desired. This status was confirmed to an extent by the Merchant Shipping (Registration, etc.) Act 1993 and the consolidating Merchant Shipping Act 1995 which, in Section 4, Subsection 1, prohibits the use of any distinctive national colours or those used or resembling flags or pendants on Her Majesty's Ships, \"except the [[Red Ensign]], the Union flag (commonly known as the Union Jack) with a white border\", and some other exceptions permitted elsewhere in the Acts. However, Section 2 regards the \"British flag\", and states that \"The flag which every British ship is entitled to fly is the Red Ensign (without any defacement or modification) and, subject to (a warrant from Her Majesty or from the Secretary of State, or an Order of Council from her Majesty regarding a defaced [[Red Ensign]]), no other colours.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/21/data.pdf |title=Merchant Shipping Act 1995 |website=UK Public General Acts |publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] |date=19 July 1995 |accessdate=2010-01-17}}</ref> Many civil vessels continue to fly the white bordered Union Flag without official opposition, making it the [[de facto]] Civil Jack.{{citation needed |date=September 2012}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Hudsons Bay Company Flag.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Hudson's Bay Company]] which originated from its days as a British trading company]]\n\nThe [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) was one of a few non-government institutions using the Union Jack in part of the flag. HBC rival [[North West Company]] had a similar flag as well. The HBC jack is no longer in use and replaced with a corporate flag featuring the company's coat of arms.\n\nThe Union Jack is the third [[quartering (heraldry)|quarter]] of the 1939 [[coat of arms of Alabama]], which is also used on the flag of the Governor of Alabama, representing British sovereignty over the state prior to 1783. The version used is the modern flag, whereas the 1707 flag would have been used in colonial Alabama.\n\nIn the former International Settlement of [[Kulangsu]] the Kulangsu Municipal Police had a badge contained multiple flags, including the Union Flag.

In March 1899 the young Churchill wrote to his mother from India about her plans to produce a new trans-Atlantic magazine, to be called ''The Anglo-Saxon Review''. The drawing at the end of this letter was deliberately mischievous, teasing her for going down-market, and in the accompanying letter he wrote, 'Your title \"The Anglo Saxon\" with its motto \"Blood is thicker than water\" only needs the Union Jack & the Star Spangled Banner crossed on the cover to be suited to one of Harmsworth's [a leading British newspaper owner] cheap Imperialist productions.'<ref>{{cite letter |url=http://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/page?contextId=CHAR%2028%2F26%2F11-12#image=0 |last=Churchill |first=Winston |recipient=Jeanette, Lady Randolph Churchill |date=2 March 1899}}</ref>\n\nThe Union Flag has been a prominent symbol in the sphere of [[fashion]] since the [[British Invasion]] movement of the 1960s, in a similar manner to the American [[Stars and Stripes flag]], and came back into fashion in the mid-1990s '[[Cool Britannia]]' era, notably [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Geri Halliwell]]'s iconic [[Union Jack dress]] of the [[1997 Brit Awards]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/fashion-news/news/a40047/story-of-geri-halliwell-union-jack-brits-dress/|title=It has been 20 years since Geri Halliwell wore the Union Jack dress|author=Amy de Klerk|date=22 February 2017|work=Harper's Bazaar}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/201202027142/geri-halliwell-launches-new-union-jack-range/ |title=Geri revisits Spice Girls' heyday in Union Jack dress |work=Hello Magazine |accessdate=3 February 2015 |date=2 February 2012 }}</ref> A notable increase in popularity was seen in [[Cuba]] following the [[2012 London Olympics]], with clothing, nail decoration, tattoos, and hairstyles in youths being observed featuring the pattern.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21082793 |title=Close Up: Cuba's new love for the Union flag |website=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-03}}</ref>\n\nCommonly the Union Flag is used on computer software and Internet pages as an [[Computer icon|icon]] representing a choice of the [[English language]] where a choice among multiple languages may be presented to the user, though the American flag is also commonly used for this purpose.

Native hunters used numerous cave-ins or trap-ins called \"''bitag''\" in the local dialect. Hence, the place was referred to as \"Mabitag\" meaning \"a place with many traps\".\n\nMabitac is situated on the eastern side of the province of Laguna, {{convert|88|km}} from [[Manila]] using [[Rizal]] Province on a winding road of [[Manila East Road]], and [[Antipolo]] City or {{convert|123|km}} via the [[Philippine National Railways|South Luzon Express]], [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] and [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], Laguna.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nMabitac is politically subdivided into 15 [[barangay]]s:{{PSGC detail|area}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Amuyong\n* Lambac ([[Poblacion]])\n* Lucong (Poblacion)\n* Matalatala\n* Nanguma\n* Numero\n* Paagahan\n* Bayanihan ([[Poblacion]])\n* Libis ng Nayon ([[Poblacion]])\n* Maligaya ([[Poblacion]])\n* Masikap ([[Poblacion]])\n* Pag-Asa ([[Poblacion]])\n* Sinagtala ([[Poblacion]])\n* San Antonio\n* San Miguel\n}}\n\n==History==\nThe first Spaniards who came to this place were the friars who established the first Spanish settlement in the area and began to Christianize the local population. The Spaniards, having difficulty in pronouncing the \"G\" consonant, called this place \"Mabitac\" whenever they mentioned this place. Eventually, the name found its way in the official records and maps of Laguna made by Spanish cartographers and mariners who chartered the coastal areas of Laguna de Bay.\n\nThis town was formerly a barrio of [[Siniloan, Laguna|Siniloan]], an immediate neighboring town. It became an independent municipality only in the year 1611, not by legislation, but by mutual agreement by and between the Spanish friars of both towns who were then the influential ruling class.\n\n[[Battle of Mabitac|Mabitac was the site of a battle]] in the [[Philippine-American War]], when on September 17, 1900, Filipinos under General [[Juan Cailles]] defeated an American force commanded by Colonel Benjamin F. Cheatham.\n\n===World War II===\nIn 1942, Japanese soldiers entered and occupied Mabitac.

Native hunters used numerous cave-ins or trap-ins called \"''bitag''\" in the local dialect. Hence, the place was referred to as \"Mabitag\" meaning \"a place with many traps\".\n\nMabitac is situated on the eastern side of the province of Laguna, {{convert|88|km}} from [[Manila]] using [[Rizal]] Province on a winding road of [[Manila East Road]], and [[Antipolo]] City or {{convert|123|km}} via the [[Philippine National Railways|South Luzon Express]], [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] and [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]], Laguna.\n\n==Barangays==\n\nMabitac is politically subdivided into 15 [[barangay]]s:{{PSGC detail|area}}\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Amuyong\n* Lambac ([[Poblacion]])\n* Lucong (Poblacion)\n* Matalatala\n* Nanguma\n* Numero\n* Paagahan\n* Bayanihan ([[Poblacion]])\n* Libis ng Nayon ([[Poblacion]])\n* Maligaya ([[Poblacion]])\n* Masikap ([[Poblacion]])\n* Pag-Asa ([[Poblacion]])\n* Sinagtala ([[Poblacion]])\n* San Antonio\n* San Miguel\n}}\n\n==History==\nThe first Spaniards who came to this place were the friars who established the first Spanish settlement in the area and began to Christianize the local population. The Spaniards, having difficulty in pronouncing the \"G\" consonant, called this place \"Mabitac\" whenever they mentioned this place. Eventually, the name found its way in the official records and maps of Laguna made by Spanish cartographers and mariners who chartered the coastal areas of Laguna de Bay.\n\nThis town was formerly a barrio of [[Siniloan, Laguna|Siniloan]], an immediate neighboring town. It became an independent municipality only in the year 1611, not by legislation, but by mutual agreement by and between the Spanish friars of both towns who were then the influential ruling class.\n\n[[Battle of Mabitac|Mabitac was the site of a battle]] in the [[Philippine-American War]], when on September 17, 1900, Filipinos under General [[Juan Cailles]] defeated an American force commanded by Colonel Benjamin F.
