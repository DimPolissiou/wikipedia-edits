The film follows ten Londoners through a city framed by capital and loss, as they navigate their wild and wayward way, travelling on their own terms towards a co-existence far stronger than 'community'.

They question who has stolen what from whom, and how things might be fixed, in an often contradictory rite of passage.

They question who has stolen what from whom, and how things might be fixed, in an often contradictory rite of passage.

He was given a rigorous [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] education at the ''Coll\u00e8ge de Bourbon'' ([[Lyc\u00e9e Pierre-Corneille]] since 1873)<ref name=\"LyCo6\">[http://lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr/spip.php?article6 Lyc\u00e9e Pierre Corneille de Rouen \u2013 History]</ref> where acting on the stage was part of the [[Jesuit drama|training]]. At 18 he began to study law but his practical legal endeavors were largely unsuccessful. Corneille's father secured two magisterial posts for him with the Rouen department of Forests and Rivers. During his time with the department, he wrote his first play. It is unknown exactly when he wrote it, but the play, the [[comedy]] ''[[M\u00e9lite]]'', surfaced when Corneille brought it to a group of traveling actors in 1629. The actors approved of the work and made it part of their repertoire. The play was a success in Paris and Corneille began writing plays on a regular basis. He moved to Paris in the same year and soon became one of the leading playwrights of the French stage. His early comedies, starting with ''M\u00e9lite'', depart from the French farce tradition by reflecting the elevated language and manners of fashionable Parisian society. Corneille describes his variety of comedy as \"une peinture de la conversation des honn\u00eates gens\" (\"a painting of the conversation of the gentry\"). His first true [[tragedy]] is ''[[M\u00e9d\u00e9e]]'', produced in 1635.\n\n==={{Lang|fr|Les Cinq Auteurs}}===\nThe year 1634 brought more attention to Corneille. He was selected to write verses for the [[Cardinal Richelieu]]\u2019s visit to Rouen. The Cardinal took notice of Corneille and selected him to be among ''{{Lang|fr|Les Cinq Auteurs}}'' (\"The Five Poets\"; also translated as \"the society of the five authors\"). The others were [[Guillaume Colletet]], [[Boisrobert]], [[Jean Rotrou]], and [[Claude de L'Estoile]].\n\nThe five were selected to realize Richelieu's vision of a new kind of drama that emphasized virtue. Richelieu would present ideas, which the writers would express in dramatic form. However, the Cardinal's demands were too restrictive for Corneille, who attempted to innovate outside the boundaries defined by Richelieu. This led to contention between playwright and employer. After his initial contract ended, Corneille left ''{{Lang|fr|Les Cinq Auteurs}}'' and returned to Rouen.\n\n===''Querelle du Cid''===\nIn the years directly following this break with Richelieu, Corneille produced what is considered his finest play. ''[[Le Cid]]'' (''al sayyid'' in Arabic; roughly translated as \"The Lord\") is based on the play ''Mocedades del Cid'' (1621) by [[Guill\u00e9n de Castro y Bellvis|Guillem de Castro]]. Both plays were based on the legend of [[Rodrigo D\u00edaz de Vivar]] (nicknamed \"El Cid Campeador\"), a military figure in [[Medieval Spain]].\n\n[[File:Corneille cour Napoleon Louvre.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Corneille at the Louvre]]\nThe original 1637 edition of the play was subtitled a [[tragicomedy]], acknowledging that it intentionally defies the classical [[tragedy]]/[[comedy]] distinction. Even though ''Le Cid'' was an enormous popular success, it was the subject of a heated argument over the norms of dramatic practice, known as the \"''Querelle du Cid''\" or \"The Quarrel of Le Cid\". Cardinal Richelieu's ''[[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]'' acknowledged the play's success, but determined that it was defective, in part because it did not respect the [[classical unities]] of time, place, and action (Unity of Time stipulated that all the action in a play must take place within a 24-hour time-frame; Unity of Place, that there must be only one setting for the action; and Unity of Action, that the plot must be centred on a single conflict or problem). The newly formed ''Acad\u00e9mie'' was a body that asserted state control over cultural activity. Although it usually dealt with efforts to standardize the [[French language]], Richelieu himself ordered an analysis of ''Le Cid''.\n\nAccusations of immorality were leveled at the play in the form of a famous pamphlet campaign. These attacks were founded on the classical theory that the theatre was a site of moral instruction. The Acad\u00e9mie's recommendations concerning the play are articulated in [[Jean Chapelain]]'s ''[[Sentiments de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise sur la tragi-com\u00e9die du Cid]]'' (1638). Even the prominent writer [[Georges de Scud\u00e9ry]] harshly criticized the play in his ''[[Observations sur le Cid]]'' (1637). The intensity of this \"war of pamphlets\" was heightened severely by Corneille's boastful poem Excuse \u00c0 Ariste, in which he rambled and boasted about his talents, while Corneille claimed no other author could be a rival. These poems and pamphlets were made public, one after the other, as once \"esteemed\" playwrights traded slanderous blows. At one point, Corneille took several shots at criticizing author Jean Mairet's family and lineage. Scud\u00e9ry, a close friend of Mairet at the time, did not stoop to Corneille's level of \"distastefulness\", but instead continued to pillory Le Cid and its violations. Scud\u00e9ry even stated of Le Cid that, \"almost all of the beauty which the play contains is plagiarized.\"\n\nThis \"war of pamphlets\" eventually influenced Richelieu to call upon the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise to analyze the play. In their final conclusions, the Academy ruled that even though Corneille had attempted to remain loyal to the unity of time, \"Le Cid\" broke too many of the unities to be a valued piece of work.\n\nThe controversy, coupled with the Academy's ruling proved too much for Corneille, who decided to return to Rouen. When one of his plays was reviewed unfavorably, Corneille was known to withdraw from public life. He remained publicly silent for some time; privately, however, he was said to be \"troubled and obsessed by the issues, making numerous revisions to the play.\"\n\n===Response to the ''Querelle du Cid''===\nAfter a hiatus from the theater, Corneille returned in 1640. The ''Querelle du Cid'' caused Corneille to pay closer attention to classical dramatic rules. This was evident in his next plays, which were [[classical antiquity|classical]] [[tragedies]], ''[[Horace (play)|Horace]]'' (1640, dedicated to [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]), ''[[Cinna (play)|Cinna]]'' (1643), and ''[[Polyeucte]]'' (1643). These three plays and ''Le Cid'' are collectively known as Corneille's \"Classical Tetralogy\". Corneille also responded to the criticisms of the Acad\u00e9mie by making multiple revisions to ''Le Cid'' to make it closer to the conventions of classical tragedy. The 1648, 1660, and 1682 editions were no longer subtitled \"[[tragicomedy]]\", but \"tragedy\".\n[[File:Adrienne lecouvreur dans cornlie.jpg|thumb|[[Adrienne Lecouvreur]] as Cornelia in ''[[The Death of Pompey]]'']]\nCorneille's popularity grew and by the mid 1640s, the first collection of his plays was published. Corneille married Marie de Lamp\u00e9ri\u00e8re in 1641. They had seven children together. In the mid to late 1640s, Corneille produced mostly tragedies, ''La Mort de Pomp\u00e9e'' (''[[The Death of Pompey]]'', performed 1644), ''[[Rodogune]]'' (performed 1645), ''[[Th\u00e9odore (Corneille)|Th\u00e9odore]]'' (performed 1646), and ''[[H\u00e9raclius]]'' (performed 1647). He also wrote one comedy in this period, ''[[Le Menteur]]'' (''The Liar'', 1644).\n\nIn 1652, the play ''[[Pertharite]]'' met with poor critical reviews and a disheartened Corneille decided to quit the theatre. He began to focus on an influential verse translation of the ''[[Imitation of Christ]]'' by [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]], which he completed in 1656. After an absence of nearly eight years, Corneille was persuaded to return to the stage in 1659. He wrote the play ''[[Oedipe (Corneille)|Oedipe]]'', which was favored by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. In the next year, Corneille published ''[[Trois discours sur le po\u00e8me dramatique]]'' (''[[Three Discourses on Dramatic Poetry]]''), which were, in part, defenses of his style. These writings can be seen as Corneille's response to the ''Querelle du Cid''. He simultaneously maintained the importance of classical dramatic rules and justified his own transgressions of those rules in ''Le Cid''. Corneille argued the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] dramatic guidelines were not meant to be subject to a strict literal reading. Instead, he suggested that they were open to interpretation. Although the relevance of classical rules was maintained, Corneille suggested that the rules should not be so tyrannical that they stifle innovation.\n\n===Later plays===\nEven though Corneille was prolific after his return to the stage, writing one play a year for the 14 years after 1659, his later plays did not have the same success as those of his earlier career. Other writers were beginning to gain popularity. In 1670 Corneille and [[Jean Racine]], one of his dramatic rivals, were challenged to write plays on the same incident. Each playwright was unaware that the challenge had also been issued to the other. When both plays were completed, it was generally acknowledged that Corneille's ''[[Tite et B\u00e9r\u00e9nice]]'' (1671) was inferior to Racine's play (''[[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice]]''). [[Moli\u00e8re]] was also prominent at the time and Corneille even composed the [[comedy]] ''[[Psych\u00e9 (play)|Psych\u00e9]]'' (1671) in collaboration with him (and [[Philippe Quinault]]). Most of the plays that Corneille wrote after his return to the stage were tragedies. They included ''{{Interlanguage link multi|La Toison d'or (play){{!}}La Toison d'or|fr|3=La Toison d'or}}'' (''The Golden Fleece'', 1660), ''[[Sertorius (play)|Sertorius]]'' (1662), ''[[Othon (play)|Othon]]'' (1664), ''[[Ag\u00e9silas]]'' (1666), and ''[[Attila (Corneille)|Attila]]'' (1667).\n\nHe wrote his last piece ''[[Sur\u00e9na]]'' in 1674 : it was a complete failure. After this, he retired from the stage for the final time and died at his home in Paris in 1684. His grave in the [[\u00c9glise Saint-Roch]] went without a monument until 1821.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe dramatist, author and philosopher [[Voltaire]] created, with the support of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], a twelve-volume annotated set of Corneille's dramatic works, the ''[[Commentaires sur Corneille]]''.<ref name=\"ocv53_introduction\">\"Introduction\" in ''Commentaires sur Corneille'' Critical edition by David Williams, in ''\u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de Voltaire'' Volume 53 (Voltaire Foundation, Oxford)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSe0zCOQ5tIC|title=In the King's Wake: Post-Absolutist Culture in France|last=Caplan|first=Jay|date=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226093116|pages=181|language=en}}</ref> It was Voltaire's largest ever work of [[literary criticism]].<ref name=\"williams_foreign\">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=David|date=1976|title=The Role of the Foreign Theatre in Voltaire's \"Corneille\"|jstor=3724782|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=71|issue=2|pages=282\u2013293|doi=10.2307/3724782}}</ref> Voltaire's proposal to the Acad\u00e9mie described Corneille as doing for the French language what [[Homer]] had done for Greek: showing the world that it could be a medium for great art.<ref name=\"ocv53_introduction\" /> Voltaire was driven to defend classic French literature in the face of increasingly popular foreign influences such as [[William Shakespeare]]. This is reflected in the first edition of the ''Commentaires'', published in 1764, which focused on Corneille's better works and had relatively muted criticisms. By the second edition, published ten years later, Voltaire had come to a more negative assessment of Corneille and a stronger view on the need for objective criticism. He added five hundred critical notes, covering more works and taking a more negative tone.<ref name=\"ocv53_commentary\">\"The commentary\" in ''Commentaires sur Corneille'' Critical edition by David Williams, in ''\u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de Voltaire'' Volume 53 p. 192 (Voltaire Foundation, Oxford)</ref>\nCritics' opinions of Corneille were already highly polarised.

The intensity of this \"war of pamphlets\" was heightened severely by Corneille's boastful poem Excuse \u00c0 Ariste, in which he rambled and boasted about his talents, while Corneille claimed no other author could be a rival. These poems and pamphlets were made public, one after the other, as once \"esteemed\" playwrights traded slanderous blows. At one point, Corneille took several shots at criticizing author Jean Mairet's family and lineage. Scud\u00e9ry, a close friend of Mairet at the time, did not stoop to Corneille's level of \"distastefulness\", but instead continued to pillory Le Cid and its violations. Scud\u00e9ry even stated of Le Cid that, \"almost all of the beauty which the play contains is plagiarized.\"\n\nThis \"war of pamphlets\" eventually influenced Richelieu to call upon the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise to analyze the play. In their final conclusions, the Academy ruled that even though Corneille had attempted to remain loyal to the unity of time, \"Le Cid\" broke too many of the unities to be a valued piece of work.\n\nThe controversy, coupled with the Academy's ruling proved too much for Corneille, who decided to return to Rouen. When one of his plays was reviewed unfavorably, Corneille was known to withdraw from public life. He remained publicly silent for some time; privately, however, he was said to be \"troubled and obsessed by the issues, making numerous revisions to the play.\"\n\n===Response to the ''Querelle du Cid''===\nAfter a hiatus from the theater, Corneille returned in 1640. The ''Querelle du Cid'' caused Corneille to pay closer attention to classical dramatic rules. This was evident in his next plays, which were [[classical antiquity|classical]] [[tragedies]], ''[[Horace (play)|Horace]]'' (1640, dedicated to [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]]), ''[[Cinna (play)|Cinna]]'' (1643), and ''[[Polyeucte]]'' (1643). These three plays and ''Le Cid'' are collectively known as Corneille's \"Classical Tetralogy\". Corneille also responded to the criticisms of the Acad\u00e9mie by making multiple revisions to ''Le Cid'' to make it closer to the conventions of classical tragedy. The 1648, 1660, and 1682 editions were no longer subtitled \"[[tragicomedy]]\", but \"tragedy\".\n[[File:Adrienne lecouvreur dans cornlie.jpg|thumb|[[Adrienne Lecouvreur]] as Cornelia in ''[[The Death of Pompey]]'']]\nCorneille's popularity grew and by the mid 1640s, the first collection of his plays was published. Corneille married Marie de Lamp\u00e9ri\u00e8re in 1641. They had seven children together. In the mid to late 1640s, Corneille produced mostly tragedies, ''La Mort de Pomp\u00e9e'' (''[[The Death of Pompey]]'', performed 1644), ''[[Rodogune]]'' (performed 1645), ''[[Th\u00e9odore (Corneille)|Th\u00e9odore]]'' (performed 1646), and ''[[H\u00e9raclius]]'' (performed 1647). He also wrote one comedy in this period, ''[[Le Menteur]]'' (''The Liar'', 1644).\n\nIn 1652, the play ''[[Pertharite]]'' met with poor critical reviews and a disheartened Corneille decided to quit the theatre. He began to focus on an influential verse translation of the ''[[Imitation of Christ]]'' by [[Thomas \u00e0 Kempis]], which he completed in 1656. After an absence of nearly eight years, Corneille was persuaded to return to the stage in 1659. He wrote the play ''[[Oedipe (Corneille)|Oedipe]]'', which was favored by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. In the next year, Corneille published ''[[Trois discours sur le po\u00e8me dramatique]]'' (''[[Three Discourses on Dramatic Poetry]]''), which were, in part, defenses of his style. These writings can be seen as Corneille's response to the ''Querelle du Cid''. He simultaneously maintained the importance of classical dramatic rules and justified his own transgressions of those rules in ''Le Cid''. Corneille argued the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] dramatic guidelines were not meant to be subject to a strict literal reading. Instead, he suggested that they were open to interpretation. Although the relevance of classical rules was maintained, Corneille suggested that the rules should not be so tyrannical that they stifle innovation.\n\n===Later plays===\nEven though Corneille was prolific after his return to the stage, writing one play a year for the 14 years after 1659, his later plays did not have the same success as those of his earlier career. Other writers were beginning to gain popularity. In 1670 Corneille and [[Jean Racine]], one of his dramatic rivals, were challenged to write plays on the same incident. Each playwright was unaware that the challenge had also been issued to the other. When both plays were completed, it was generally acknowledged that Corneille's ''[[Tite et B\u00e9r\u00e9nice]]'' (1671) was inferior to Racine's play (''[[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice]]''). [[Moli\u00e8re]] was also prominent at the time and Corneille even composed the [[comedy]] ''[[Psych\u00e9 (play)|Psych\u00e9]]'' (1671) in collaboration with him (and [[Philippe Quinault]]). Most of the plays that Corneille wrote after his return to the stage were tragedies. They included ''{{Interlanguage link multi|La Toison d'or (play){{!}}La Toison d'or|fr|3=La Toison d'or}}'' (''The Golden Fleece'', 1660), ''[[Sertorius (play)|Sertorius]]'' (1662), ''[[Othon (play)|Othon]]'' (1664), ''[[Ag\u00e9silas]]'' (1666), and ''[[Attila (Corneille)|Attila]]'' (1667).\n\nHe wrote his last piece ''[[Sur\u00e9na]]'' in 1674 : it was a complete failure. After this, he retired from the stage for the final time and died at his home in Paris in 1684. His grave in the [[\u00c9glise Saint-Roch]] went without a monument until 1821.\n\n== Legacy ==\nThe dramatist, author and philosopher [[Voltaire]] created, with the support of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], a twelve-volume annotated set of Corneille's dramatic works, the ''[[Commentaires sur Corneille]]''.<ref name=\"ocv53_introduction\">\"Introduction\" in ''Commentaires sur Corneille'' Critical edition by David Williams, in ''\u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de Voltaire'' Volume 53 (Voltaire Foundation, Oxford)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RSe0zCOQ5tIC|title=In the King's Wake: Post-Absolutist Culture in France|last=Caplan|first=Jay|date=1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226093116|pages=181|language=en}}</ref> It was Voltaire's largest ever work of [[literary criticism]].<ref name=\"williams_foreign\">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=David|date=1976|title=The Role of the Foreign Theatre in Voltaire's \"Corneille\"|jstor=3724782|journal=The Modern Language Review|volume=71|issue=2|pages=282\u2013293|doi=10.2307/3724782}}</ref> Voltaire's proposal to the Acad\u00e9mie described Corneille as doing for the French language what [[Homer]] had done for Greek: showing the world that it could be a medium for great art.<ref name=\"ocv53_introduction\" /> Voltaire was driven to defend classic French literature in the face of increasingly popular foreign influences such as [[William Shakespeare]]. This is reflected in the first edition of the ''Commentaires'', published in 1764, which focused on Corneille's better works and had relatively muted criticisms. By the second edition, published ten years later, Voltaire had come to a more negative assessment of Corneille and a stronger view on the need for objective criticism. He added five hundred critical notes, covering more works and taking a more negative tone.<ref name=\"ocv53_commentary\">\"The commentary\" in ''Commentaires sur Corneille'' Critical edition by David Williams, in ''\u0152uvres compl\u00e8tes de Voltaire'' Volume 53 p. 192 (Voltaire Foundation, Oxford)</ref>\nCritics' opinions of Corneille were already highly polarised.

{"title_page": "History of German foreign policy", "text_new": "The '''History of German foreign policy''' covers diplomatic developments and international history since 1871.\n\nBefore 1871, [[Prussia]] was the dominant factor in German affairs, but there were numerous smaller states.  The question of excluding or including Austria's influence was settled by the Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866.  The [[unification of Germany]] was made possible by the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u201371, in which the smaller states joined behind Prussia in a smashing victory over France.  The [[German Empire]] was put together in 1871 by [[Otto von Bismarck]], who dominated German and indeed all of European diplomatic history until he was forced to resign in 1890.\n\nThe new [[German Empire]] immediately became the dominant diplomatic, political, military and economic force in Europe, although it never had as large a population as Russia.  Great Britain continued to dominate the world in naval affairs, international trade, and finance.  The Germans tried to catch up in empire building but felt an inferiority complex.\n\nBismarck felt a strong need to keep France isolated, lest its desire for revenge frustrate his goals, which after 1871 were European peace and stability.  When Kaiser Wilhelm removed Bismarck in 1890, German foreign policy became erratic and increasingly isolated, with only [[Austria-Hungary]] as a serious ally and partner.\n\nDuring the [[July Crisis]], Germany played a major role in starting [[World War I]] in 1914. The Allies defeated Germany in 1918. The [[Versailles Peace Treaty]] was punishing for Germany. \n\nBy the mid-1920s, Germany had largely recovered its role as a great power thanks to astute diplomacy on its own part, the willingness of the British and Americans compromise, and financial aid from New York.  Internal German politics became frenzied after 1929 and the impact of the [[Great Depression]], leading to a takeover by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] in 1933.  They introduced a highly aggressive foreign policy in alliance with Italy and Japan. The British and French tried to appease in 1938, which only whetted Hitler's appetite for more territory, especially in the East. [[Nazi Germany]] had by far the most decisive role in starting [[World War II]] in 1939.\n\nSince 1945, Germany has recovered from massive wartime destruction to become again the richest and most powerful country in Europe, this time it is fully integrated into European affairs. Its major conflict was [[West Germany]] versus [[East Germany]], with East Germany being a client state of the [[Soviet Union]] until the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]]. Since the 1970s, (West) Germany has also sought to play a more important role internationally again.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The United Nations and Terrorism. Germany, Multilateralism, and Antiterrorism Efforts in the 1970s|last=Blumenau|first=Bernhard|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=978-1-137-39196-4|location=Basingstoke|pages=201}}</ref> \n\n==1871\u20131919==\n{{main article|International relations (1814\u20131919)}}\n===Military role in the foreign policy decisions of the German Empire===\nAfter the creation of the German Empire in 1871, diplomatic relations were handled by the Imperial government, rather than by lowel-level governments such as the Prussian and Bavarian governments. Down to 1914, the [[Chancellor of the German Empire|Chancellor]] typically dominated foreign policy decisions, supported by his Foreign Minister. The powerful [[Imperial German Army|German Army]] reported separately to the [[German Emperor|Emperor]], and increasingly played a major role in shaping foreign policy when military alliances or warfare was at issue.<ref>Gordon A. Craig, The politics of the Prussian army 1640-1945 (1955) 255-98.</ref>\n\nIn diplomatic terms, Germany used the Prussian system of military attaches attached to diplomatic locations, with highly talented young officers assigned to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, and military capabilities of their assigned nations. These officers used close observation, conversations, and paid agents to produce very high quality reports that gave a significant advantage to the military planners.<ref>James Stone,  \"Spies and diplomats in Bismarck\u2019s Germany: collaboration between military intelligence and the Foreign Office, 1871\u20131881.\" Journal of Intelligence History (2014) 13#1 pp: 22\u201340.</ref>\n\nThe military staff grew increasingly powerful, reducing the role of the Minister of War and increasingly asserting itself in foreign policy decisions. [[Otto von Bismarck]], the Imperial Chancellor from 1871 to 1890, was annoyed by military interference in foreign policy affairs\u2013in 1887, for example, the military tried to convince the Emperor to declare war on Russia; they also encouraged Austria to attack Russia. Bismarck never controlled the army, but he did complain vehemently, and the military leaders drew back. In 1905, when the [[Tangier Crisis|Morocco affair]] was roiling international politics, [[Chief of the German General Staff]] [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] called for a preventive war against France. At a critical point in the [[July crisis of 1914]], [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|Helmuth von Moltke]], the Chief of Staff, without telling the Emperor or Chancellor, advised his counterpart in Austria to mobilize against Russia at once. During [[World War I]], Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and General [[Erich Ludendorff]] increasingly set foreign policy, working directly with the Emperor\u2013and indeed shaped his decision-making\u2013leaving the chancellor and civilian officials in the dark. Historian [[Gordon A. Craig]] says that the crucial decisions in going to war in 1914, \"were made by the soldiers and that, in making them, they displayed an almost complete disregard for political considerations.\"<ref> Craig, pp 268-70, 283, 293. Quotation page 294.</ref>\n\n===Bismarck===\n[[Image:Triple Alliance.png|thumb|The Triple Alliance (1913-configuration, shown in red) was constructed to isolate France.]]\n\nBismarck's post-1871 foreign policy was peace-oriented.  Germany was content--it had all it wanted so that its main goal was peace and stability. However, peaceful relations with France became impossible in 1871 when Germany annexed the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. Public opinion demanded it to humiliate France, and the Army wanted its more defensible frontiers. Bismarck reluctantly gave in--French would never forget or forgive, he calculated, so might as well take the provinces. (That was a mistaken assumption--after about five years the French did calm down and considered it a minor issue.)<ref>{{cite book|author=Allan Mitchell|title=The German Influence in France after 1870: The Formation of the French Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQZfDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT190|year=2018|page=190}}</ref>) Germany's foreign policy fell into a trap with no exit. \"In retrospect it is easy to see that the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine was a tragic mistake.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=George O.

However France complicated Berlin's plans when it became friends with Russia. In 1905 a German plan for an alliance with Russia fell through because Russia was too close to France.<ref>John Keiger, ''France and the World since 1870'' (2001) pp 111-117.</ref>\n\nThe [[League of Three Emperors]] (''Dreikaisersbund'') was signed in 1872 by Russia, Austria, and Germany. It stated that [[republicanism]] and [[socialism]] were common enemies and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed good relations with Russia in order to keep France isolated. In 1877\u20131878, Russia fought a victorious [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|war with the Ottoman Empire]] and attempted to impose the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] on it. This upset the British in particular, as they were long concerned with preserving the [[Ottoman Empire]] and preventing a Russian takeover of the [[Bosphorus Strait]]. Germany hosted the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878), whereby a more moderate peace settlement was agreed to. Germany had no direct interest in the Balkans, however, which was largely an Austrian and Russian sphere of influence, although King Carol of Romania was a German prince.\n\n[[File:Deutsche Kolonien.PNG|thumb|400px|[[German colonial empire|German colonies and protectorates]] in 1914]] \n\nIn 1879, Bismarck formed a Dual Alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary, with the aim of mutual military assistance in the case of an attack from Russia, which was not satisfied with the agreement reached at the Congress of Berlin.  The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance, and in 1887, the so-called [[Reinsurance Treaty]] was signed between Germany and Russia: in it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany, or in case of an Austrian attack on Russia.  Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy joined the Dual Alliance to form a [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. Italy wanted to defend its interests in [[North Africa]] against France's colonial policy. In return for German and Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a French military attack.<ref>{{Citation | first=Patricia A. | last=Weitsman | title=Dangerous alliances: proponents of peace, weapons of war | year=2004 | page=79}}</ref>\n\nFor a long time, Bismarck had refused to give in widespread public demands to give Germany \"a place in the sun\" through the acquisition of overseas colonies. In 1880 Bismarck gave way, and a number of colonies were established overseas. In Africa, these were [[Togo]], the [[Cameroons]], [[German South-West Africa]], and [[German East Africa]]; in [[Oceania]], they were [[German New Guinea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], and the [[Marshall Islands]]. In fact, it was Bismarck himself who helped initiate the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885. He did it to \"establish international guidelines for the acquisition of African territory\" (see [[Colonisation of Africa]]). This conference was an impetus for the \"Scramble for Africa\" and \"[[New Imperialism]]\".<ref>{{cite book | first=Kirsten |last=Belgum | title=Popularizing the Nation: Audience, Representation, and the Production of Identity in \"Die Gartenlaube,\" 1853\u20131900 | year=1998 |page=149}}</ref>\n\n===Kaiser Wilhelm===\n{{Main article|Triple Alliance (1882)}}\n\nAfter removing Bismarck in 1890 the young [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] sought aggressively to increase Germany's influence in the world (''[[Weltpolitik]]'').<ref> Brandenburg, ''From Bismarck to the World War: A History of German Foreign Policy 1870-1914'' (1927) pp 20-52.</ref> Foreign policy was in the hands of an erratic Kaiser, who played an increasingly reckless hand,<ref>On the Kaiser's \"histrionic personality disorder\", see {{cite book|author=Frank B.

But Russia did form a closer relationship with France in the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Dual Alliance of 1894]], since both were worried about the possibilities of German aggression.  Furthermore, Anglo\u2013German relations cooled as Germany aggressively tried to build a new empire and engaged in a [[Anglo-German naval arms race|naval race]] with Britain; London refused to agree to the formal alliance that Germany sought.  Berlin's analysis proved mistaken on every point, leading to Germany's increasing isolation and its dependence on the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], which brought together Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. The Triple Alliance was undermined by differences between Austria and Italy, and in 1915 Italy switched sides.<ref name=raff>{{citation | first=Diethher |last=Raff | title=History of Germany from the Medieval Empire to the Present | year=1988 | pages=34\u201355, 202\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the German Navy under Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] had ambitions to rival the great British Navy, and dramatically expanded its fleet in the early 20th century to protect the colonies and exert power worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |last= David Woodward | title=Admiral Tirpitz, Secretary of State for the Navy, 1897\u20131916 | journal=History Today | date=July 1963 | volume=13  |issue=8 | pages=548\u2013555}}</ref>  Tirpitz started a programme of warship construction in 1898. In 1890, Germany had gained the island of [[Heligoland]] in the North Sea from Britain in exchange for the eastern African island of [[Zanzibar]], and proceeded to construct a great naval base there. This posed a direct threat to British hegemony on the seas, with the result that negotiations for an alliance between Germany and Britain broke down. The British, however, kept well ahead in the [[Anglo-German naval arms race|naval race]] by the introduction of the highly advanced new ''[[Dreadnought]]'' battleship in 1907.<ref>{{cite book |last=Holger Herwig | title=Luxury Fleet: The Imperial German Navy 1888\u20131918 | year=1980}}</ref>\n====Two crises in Morocco====\nIn the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] of 1905, Germany nearly came to blows with Britain and France when the latter attempted to establish a protectorate over Morocco. The Germans were upset at having not been informed about French intentions, and declared their support for Moroccan independence. William II made a highly provocative speech regarding this. The following year, a conference was held in which all of the European powers except Austria-Hungary (by now little more than a German satellite) sided with France. A compromise was brokered by the United States where the French relinquished some, but not all, control over Morocco.<ref>{{cite book |last=Raymond A. Esthus | title=Theodore Roosevelt and the International Rivalries | year=1970 | pages=66\u2013111}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Agadir Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis]] of 1911 saw another dispute over Morocco erupt when France tried to suppress a revolt there. Germany, still smarting from the previous quarrel, agreed to a settlement whereby the French ceded some territory in central Africa in exchange for Germany's renouncing any right to intervene in Moroccan affairs. It was a diplomatic triumph for France.<ref> Brandenburg, ''From Bismarck to the World War: A History of German Foreign Policy 1870-1914'' (1927) pp 370-93.</ref>\n\nHistorian Heather Jones argues that Germany's use of warlike rhetoric was a deliberate diplomatic ploy:\n:Another German strategy was to stage dramatic gestures, and dangerously play up the threat of war, in the belief that this would impress upon other European powers the importance of consultation with Germany on imperial issues: the fact that France had not considered it necessary to make a bilateral agreement with Germany over Morocco rankled, especially given Germany was deeply insecure about its newly acquired Great Power status.  Hence Germany opted for an increase in belligerent rhetoric and, theatrically, Kaiser Wilhelm II dramatically interrupted a Mediterranean cruise to visit Tangier, where he declared Germany's support for the Sultan's independence and integrity of his kingdom, turning Morocco overnight into an international 'crisis.' <ref> Heather Jones, \"Algeciras Revisited: European Crisis and Conference Diplomacy, 16 January-7 April 1906.\" (EUI WorkingPaper MWP 2009/1, 2009),\n p 5 [http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/10527/MWP_2009_01.pdf?...1 online]</ref>\n\nThe German adventure resulted in failure and frustration, as military cooperation and friendship between France and Britain was strengthened, and Germany was left more isolated.  An even more momentous consequence was the heightened sense of frustration and readiness for war in Germany.  It spread beyond the political elite to much of the press and most of the political parties except for the Liberals and Social Democrats on the left.  The Pan-German element grew in strength and denounced their government's retreat as treason, stepping up chauvinistic support for war. <ref>Immanuel Geiss, ''German Foreign Policy 1871 \u2013 1914'' (1976) 133-36. </ref>\n\n===First World War===\n{{main article|German entry into World War I|Causes of World War I|Diplomatic history of World War I}}\n\nEthnic groups demanded their own nation states, threatening violence. This  upset the stability of multinational empires (Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Turkey/Ottoman).  When ethnic Serbians assassinate the Austrian heir, Austria decided to heavily punish Serbia. Germany stood behind its ally Austria in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the informal protection of Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and in 1915 Italy.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Albrecht-Carri\u00e9, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1958), pp 299-332.</ref>\n\nIn explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, Kennedy (1980) recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a profound moral and diplomatic crime.  Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870 \u2014 when Prussia and the German states smashed France \u2014 would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security.<ref>{{cite book | first=Paul M. |last=Kennedy | title=The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860\u20131914 | url=https://archive.org/details/riseofanglogerma0000kenn | url-access=registration | year=1980 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/riseofanglogerma0000kenn/page/464 464\u2013470]}}</ref>\n\n===German war goals===\nThe Germans never finalized a set of war aims.  However, in September 1914, [[Kurt Riezler]], a senior staff aide to German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] sketched out some possible ideas --dubbed by historians the \"[[Septemberprogramm|September Program]].\" It emphasized economic gains, turning all of Central and Western Europe into a common market controlled by and for the benefit of Germany Belgium would become a vassal state, there would be a series of naval bases threatening England, Germany would seize  much of Eastern Europe from Russia \u2013 as in fact it did in early 1918. There would be a crippling financial indemnity on France making it economically dependent on Germany. The Netherlands would become a dependent satellite, and British commerce would be excluded. Germany would rebuild a colonial empire in Africa.  The ideas sketched by Riezler were not fully formulated, were not endorsed by Bethmann-Hollweg, and were not presented to or approved by any official body. The ideas were formulated  on the run after the war began, and did not mean these ideas had been reflected a prewar plan, as historian [[Fritz Fischer]] fallaciously assumed. However they do indicate that if Germany had won it would have taken a very aggressive dominant position in Europe. Indeed, it took a very harsh position on occupied Belgian and France starting in 1914, and in the [[Treaty of Brest Litovsk]] imposed on Russia in 1918.<ref> Tombs, '' The English and their history '' (2014) p 611. </ref><ref>Wayne C. Thompson,  \"The September Program: Reflections on the Evidence.\" ''Central European History'' 11.4 (1978): 348-354.</ref>\n\nThe stalemate by the end of 1914 forced serious consideration of long-term goals.  Britain, France, Russia and Germany  all separately concluded this was not a traditional war with limited goals. Britain, France and Russia became committed to the destruction of German military power, and Germany to the dominance of German military power in Europe. One month into the war, Britain, France and Russia agreed not to make a separate peace with Germany, and discussions began about  enticing other countries to join in return for territorial gains.  However, as Barbara Jelavich observes, \"Throughout the war Russian actions were carried out without real coordination or joint planning with the Western powers.\"<ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet foreign policy, 1814-1974'' (1974) pp. 281\u201384.</ref> There was no serious three-way coordination of strategy, nor was there  much coordination  between Britain and France before 1917.\n\n==1919\u20131933==\n{{Main|Interwar period}}\n===Weimar Republic===\nThe humiliating peace terms in the Treaty of Versailles provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime since Paul von Hindenburg the president of Weimar Republic used article 48 to gain emergency power hence undermining democracy.\n\nWhen Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to [[passive resistance]]: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal-mines would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the Ruhr fight also led to [[hyperinflation]], and many who lost all their fortune would become bitter enemies of the Weimar Republic, and voters of the anti-democratic right. See [[1920s German inflation]].\n\nGermany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded the Soviet Union ''de jure'' recognition, and the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.  In October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rheinland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.<ref>Wolfgang Elz, \"Foreign policy\" in Anthony McElligott, ed.,  ''Weimar Germany'' (2009)  pp 50-77</ref>\n\n====Nazi era, 1933-39====\n{{main article|Causes of World War II}}\nHitler came to power in January 1933, and inaugurated an aggressive power designed to give Germany economic and political domination across central Europe.  He did not attempt to recover the lost colonies.  Until August 1939, the Nazis announced Communists and the Soviet Union is the greatest enemy, along with the Jews.\n\n[[File:1938 Naka yoshi sangoku.jpg|145px|thumb|left|Japanese poster promoting the [[Axis Powers|Axis cooperation]] in 1938]]\nHitler's diplomatic strategy in the 1930s was to make seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the [[League of Nations]] (1933), rejected the [[Versailles Treaty]] and began to re-arm (1935), won back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance (\"axis\") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339), seized Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French ''appeasement'' of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland in September 1939. Britain and France declared war and [[World War II]] began&nbsp;\u2013 somewhat sooner than the Nazis expected or were ready for.<ref>Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''Hitler's foreign policy 1933-1939: The road to World War II.'' (2013), Originally published in two volumes.</ref>\n\nAfter establishing the \"Rome-Berlin axis\" with [[Benito Mussolini]], and signing the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Japan&nbsp;\u2013 which was joined by Italy a year later in 1937&nbsp;\u2013 Hitler felt able to take the offensive in foreign policy. On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered [[Vienna]], he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation ([[Anschluss]]) of their country Austria to the [[German Reich]]. After Austria, Hitler turned to [[Czechoslovakia]], where the 3.5&nbsp;million-strong [[Sudeten German]] minority was demanding equal rights and self-government. At the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Conference]] of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by [[Czechoslovakia]]. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between [[Slovak people|Slovak]]s and [[Czechs]] as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. In the same month, he secured the return of [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel]] from [[Lithuania]] to Germany. Chamberlain was forced to acknowledge that his policy of [[appeasement]] towards Hitler had failed.\n\n===World War II===\n{{main article|Diplomatic history of World War II#Germany}}\n\nGermany's foreign policy during the war involved the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin.<ref>Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''A world at arms: a global history of World War II'' (1995), provides a thorough diplomatic history.</ref> A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies, such as Italy and Hungary, and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as [[Vichy France]].<ref>Mark Mazower, ''Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe'' (2009) ch 9</ref>  By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary.<ref>Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II'' (2005) p 414</ref>  When a country was no longer dependable, Germany would assume full control, as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943, and Hungary in 1944. Full control allowed the Nazis to achieve their high priority of mass murdering all Jewish population. Although Japan was officially a powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little coordination or cooperation, such as Germany's refusal to share the secret formula for making synthetic oil from coal until late in the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bernd Martin|title=Japan and Germany in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_jBOpYASMQC&pg=PA280|year=2005|publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=279\u201380}}</ref>\n\nHitler devoted most of his attention during the war to military and diplomatic affairs.  DiNardo argues that in Europe Germany's foreign-policy was dysfunctional during the war, as Hitler treated each ally separately, and refused to create any sort of combined staff that would synchronize policies, armaments, and strategies.  Italy, Finland, Romania, and Hungary each dealt with Berlin separately, and never coordinated their activities. Germany was reluctant to share its powerful weapons systems, or to train Axis officers. There were some exceptions, such as the close collaboration between the German and Italian forces in North Africa.<ref>Richard L.

The reunification in 1990, which saw East Germany merged into West Germany, promoted peaceful integration with its neighbors. Strong ties with the United States remain central to German foreign policy.\n\nWithin the framework of NATO and an integrated [[European Union Military Staff]], the Federal Republic has resumed the deployment of military units to mediate in conflict regions worldwide.\n\nGermany is one of the world's strongest supporters for ecological awareness in response to [[climate change]] and [[global warming]].\n\n===1945\u20131990===\n;Westbindung\n\"Bindung\" is the German word for ''fixation'' or ''bond''; \"Westbindung\" is Germany's implant into Europe and the Western World.\n\nIn particular during the [[Cold War]] \u2013 but continuous into the 21st century \u2013 (West-) German foreign policy pursues the country's integration into NATO and a strong co-operation and [[collective security]] with its Western partners.\n\nAs a free democracy and market economy, the world's largest exporting nation and the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|third-richest economy]] (nominal GDP) (behind the U.S. and Japan), Germany shares the interest and institutions of a [[Free trade|free]] and secure world trade.\n\n;Ostpolitik\n{{Main article|Ostpolitik}}\n\nUnder the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], the FRG did not have any diplomatic relations with countries in [[Eastern Bloc]] until the early 1970s, when [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''Ostpolitik'' led to increased dialogue and treaties like the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]], where West Germany accepted the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as German-Polish border, and the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]], where West and East Germany accepted each other as sovereign entities. Both Germany states were admitted to the United Nations on 18 September 1973.\n\n==== German Question and German Problem ====\nEver since the creation of the consolidated German nation state in 1871, the German Problem as to what interests, ambitions, and borders Germany would have and how it would fit into the international system, was a major concern not just for the neighbours but also for German policy-makers themselves. This Problem was temporarily suspended during the Cold War as with Germany being a divided nation, the question as to how to reunify the country (the German Question) would take precedence over other considerations. During the Cold War, both Germanys also lacked the power to challenge the system more generally.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Blumenau |first1=Bernhard  |year=2018 |chapter=German foreign policy and the \"German Problem\" during and after the Cold War |editors=B Blumenau, J Hanhim\u00e4ki, B Zanchetta |title=New Perspectives on the End of the Cold War |pages=92\u2013116 |location=London |publisher=Routledge |doi=10.4324/9781315189031-6 |isbn=9781315189031}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u2013present===\n{{Main article|German reunification}}\n[[File:33rdG8Leaders.jpg|thumb|Leaders of the 33rd G8 summit in [[Heiligendamm]], Germany]]\n\nAfter the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]] and the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]], German reunification took effect on 3 October 1990.\n\nOn 14 November 1990, Germany and [[Poland]] signed a treaty confirming the [[Oder-Neisse line]].

The question of excluding or including Austria's influence was settled by the Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866.  The [[unification of Germany]] was made possible by the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870-71, in which the smaller states joined behind Prussia in a smashing victory over France.  The [[German Empire]] was put together in 1871 by [[Otto von Bismarck]], who dominated German and indeed all of European diplomatic history until he was forced to resign in 1890.\n\nThe new [[German Empire]] immediately became the dominant diplomatic, political, military and economic force in Europe, although it never had as large a population as Russia.  Great Britain continued to dominate the world in naval affairs, international trade, and finance.  The Germans tried to catch up in empire building but felt an inferiority complex.\n\nBismarck felt a strong need to keep France isolated, lest its desire for revenge frustrate his goals, which after 1871 were European peace and stability.  When Kaiser Wilhelm removed Bismarck in 1890, German foreign policy became erratic and increasingly isolated, with only [[Austria-Hungary]] as a serious ally and partner.\n\nDuring the [[July Crisis]], Germany played a major role in starting [[World War I]] in 1914. The Allies defeated Germany in 1918. The [[Versailles Peace Treaty]] was punishing for Germany. \n\nBy the mid-1920s, Germany had largely recovered its role as a great power thanks to astute diplomacy on its own part, the willingness of the British and Americans compromise, and financial aid from New York.  Internal German politics became frenzied after 1929 and the impact of the [[Great Depression]], leading to a takeover by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazis]] in 1933.  They introduced a highly aggressive foreign policy in alliance with Italy and Japan. The British and French tried to appease in 1938, which only whetted Hitler's appetite for more territory, especially in the East. [[Nazi Germany]] had by far the most decisive role in starting [[World War II]] in 1939.\n\nSince 1945, Germany has recovered from massive wartime destruction to become again the richest and most powerful country in Europe, this time it is fully integrated into European affairs. Its major conflict was [[West Germany]] versus [[East Germany]], with East Germany being a client state of the [[Soviet Union]] until the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]]. Since the 1970s, (West) Germany has also sought to play a more important role internationally again.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The United Nations and Terrorism.

Down to 1914, the [[Chancellor of the German Empire|Chancellor]] typically dominated foreign policy decisions, supported by his Foreign Minister. The powerful [[Imperial German Army|German Army]] reported separately to the [[German Emperor|Emperor]], and increasingly played a major role in shaping foreign policy when military alliances or warfare was at issue.<ref>Gordon A. Craig, The politics of the Prussian army 1640-1945 (1955) 255-98.</ref>\n\nIn diplomatic terms, Germany used the Prussian system of military attaches attached to diplomatic locations, with highly talented young officers assigned to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, and military capabilities of their assigned nations. These officers used close observation, conversations, and paid agents to produce very high quality reports that gave a significant advantage to the military planners.<ref>James Stone,  \"Spies and diplomats in Bismarck\u2019s Germany: collaboration between military intelligence and the Foreign Office, 1871\u20131881.\" Journal of Intelligence History (2014) 13#1 pp: 22\u201340.</ref>\n\nThe military staff grew increasingly powerful, reducing the role of the Minister of War and increasingly asserting itself in foreign policy decisions. [[Otto von Bismarck]], the Imperial Chancellor from 1871 to 1890, was annoyed by military interference in foreign policy affairs\u2013in 1887, for example, the military tried to convince the Emperor to declare war on Russia; they also encouraged Austria to attack Russia. Bismarck never controlled the army, but he did complain vehemently, and the military leaders drew back. In 1905, when the [[Tangier Crisis|Morocco affair]] was roiling international politics, [[Chief of the German General Staff]] [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] called for a preventive war against France. At a critical point in the [[July crisis of 1914]], [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|Helmuth von Moltke]], the Chief of Staff, without telling the Emperor or Chancellor, advised his counterpart in Austria to mobilize against Russia at once. During [[World War I]], Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and General [[Erich Ludendorff]] increasingly set foreign policy, working directly with the Emperor\u2013and indeed shaped his decision-making\u2013leaving the chancellor and civilian officials in the dark. Historian [[Gordon A. Craig]] says that the crucial decisions in going to war in 1914, \"were made by the soldiers and that, in making them, they displayed an almost complete disregard for political considerations.\"<ref> Craig, pp 268-70, 283, 293. Quotation page 294.</ref>\n\n===Bismarck===\n[[Image:Triple Alliance.png|thumb|The Triple Alliance (1913-configuration, shown in red) was constructed to isolate France.]]\n\nBismarck's post-1871 foreign policy was peace-oriented.  Germany was content--it had all it wanted so that its main goal was peace and stability. However, peaceful relations with France became impossible in 1871 when Germany annexed the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. Public opinion demanded it to humiliate France, and the Army wanted its more defensible frontiers. Bismarck reluctantly gave in--French would never forget or forgive, he calculated, so might as well take the provinces. (That was a mistaken assumption--after about five years the French did calm down and considered it a minor issue.)<ref>{{cite book|author=Allan Mitchell|title=The German Influence in France after 1870: The Formation of the French Republic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQZfDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT190|year=2018|page=190}}</ref>) Germany's foreign policy fell into a trap with no exit. \"In retrospect it is easy to see that the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine was a tragic mistake.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=George O.

However France complicated Berlin's plans when it became friends with Russia. In 1905 a German plan for an alliance with Russia fell through because Russia was too close to France.<ref>John Keiger, ''France and the World since 1870'' (2001) pp 111-117.</ref>\n\nThe [[League of Three Emperors]] (''Dreikaisersbund'') was signed in 1872 by Russia, Austria, and Germany. It stated that [[republicanism]] and [[socialism]] were common enemies and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed good relations with Russia in order to keep France isolated. In 1877\u20131878, Russia fought a victorious [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|war with the Ottoman Empire]] and attempted to impose the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] on it. This upset the British in particular, as they were long concerned with preserving the [[Ottoman Empire]] and preventing a Russian takeover of the [[Bosphorus Strait]]. Germany hosted the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878), whereby a more moderate peace settlement was agreed to. Germany had no direct interest in the Balkans, however, which was largely an Austrian and Russian sphere of influence, although King Carol of Romania was a German prince.\n\n[[File:Deutsche Kolonien.PNG|thumb|400px|[[German colonial empire|German colonies and protectorates]] in 1914]] \n\nIn 1879, Bismarck formed a Dual Alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary, with the aim of mutual military assistance in the case of an attack from Russia, which was not satisfied with the agreement reached at the Congress of Berlin.  The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance, and in 1887, the so-called [[Reinsurance Treaty]] was signed between Germany and Russia: in it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany, or in case of an Austrian attack on Russia.  Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy joined the Dual Alliance to form a [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. Italy wanted to defend its interests in [[North Africa]] against France's colonial policy. In return for German and Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a French military attack.<ref>{{Citation | first=Patricia A. | last=Weitsman | title=Dangerous alliances: proponents of peace, weapons of war | year=2004 | page=79}}</ref>\n\nFor a long time, Bismarck had refused to give in widespread public demands to give Germany \"a place in the sun\" through the acquisition of overseas colonies. In 1880 Bismarck gave way, and a number of colonies were established overseas. In Africa, these were [[Togo]], the [[Cameroons]], [[German South-West Africa]], and [[German East Africa]]; in [[Oceania]], they were [[German New Guinea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], and the [[Marshall Islands]]. In fact, it was Bismarck himself who helped initiate the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885. He did it to \"establish international guidelines for the acquisition of African territory\" (see [[Colonisation of Africa]]). This conference was an impetus for the \"Scramble for Africa\" and \"[[New Imperialism]]\".<ref>{{cite book | first=Kirsten |last=Belgum | title=Popularizing the Nation: Audience, Representation, and the Production of Identity in \"Die Gartenlaube,\" 1853\u20131900 | year=1998 |page=149}}</ref>\n\n===Kaiser Wilhelm===\n{{Main article|Triple Alliance (1882)}}\n\nAfter removing Bismarck in 1890 the young [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] sought aggressively to increase Germany's influence in the world (''[[Weltpolitik]]'').<ref> Brandenburg, ''From Bismarck to the World War: A History of German Foreign Policy 1870-1914'' (1927) pp 20-52.</ref> Foreign policy was in the hands of an erratic Kaiser, who played an increasingly reckless hand,<ref>On the Kaiser's \"histrionic personality disorder\", see {{cite book|author=Frank B.

Germany refused to renew its treaties with Russia. But Russia did form a closer relationship with France in the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Dual Alliance of 1894]], since both were worried about the possibilities of German aggression.  Furthermore, Anglo\u2013German relations cooled as Germany aggressively tried to build a new empire and engaged in a [[Anglo-German naval arms race|naval race]] with Britain; London refused to agree to the formal alliance that Germany sought.  Berlin's analysis proved mistaken on every point, leading to Germany's increasing isolation and its dependence on the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], which brought together Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. The Triple Alliance was undermined by differences between Austria and Italy, and in 1915 Italy switched sides.<ref name=raff>{{citation | first=Diethher |last=Raff | title=History of Germany from the Medieval Empire to the Present | year=1988 | pages=34\u201355, 202\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the German Navy under Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] had ambitions to rival the great British Navy, and dramatically expanded its fleet in the early 20th century to protect the colonies and exert power worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal |last= David Woodward | title=Admiral Tirpitz, Secretary of State for the Navy, 1897\u20131916 | journal=History Today | date=July 1963 | volume=13  |issue=8 | pages=548\u2013555}}</ref>  Tirpitz started a programme of warship construction in 1898. In 1890, Germany had gained the island of [[Heligoland]] in the North Sea from Britain in exchange for the eastern African island of [[Zanzibar]], and proceeded to construct a great naval base there. This posed a direct threat to British hegemony on the seas, with the result that negotiations for an alliance between Germany and Britain broke down. The British, however, kept well ahead in the [[Anglo-German naval arms race|naval race]] by the introduction of the highly advanced new ''[[Dreadnought]]'' battleship in 1907.<ref>{{cite book |last=Holger Herwig | title=Luxury Fleet: The Imperial German Navy 1888\u20131918 | year=1980}}</ref>\n====Two crises in Morocco====\nIn the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] of 1905, Germany nearly came to blows with Britain and France when the latter attempted to establish a protectorate over Morocco. The Germans were upset at having not been informed about French intentions, and declared their support for Moroccan independence. William II made a highly provocative speech regarding this. The following year, a conference was held in which all of the European powers except Austria-Hungary (by now little more than a German satellite) sided with France. A compromise was brokered by the United States where the French relinquished some, but not all, control over Morocco.<ref>{{cite book |last=Raymond A. Esthus | title=Theodore Roosevelt and the International Rivalries | year=1970 | pages=66\u2013111}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Agadir Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis]] of 1911 saw another dispute over Morocco erupt when France tried to suppress a revolt there. Germany, still smarting from the previous quarrel, agreed to a settlement whereby the French ceded some territory in central Africa in exchange for Germany's renouncing any right to intervene in Moroccan affairs. It was a diplomatic triumph for France.<ref> Brandenburg, ''From Bismarck to the World War: A History of German Foreign Policy 1870-1914'' (1927) pp 370-93.</ref>\n\nHistorian Heather Jones argues that Germany's use of warlike rhetoric was a deliberate diplomatic ploy:\n:Another German strategy was to stage dramatic gestures, and dangerously play up the threat of war, in the belief that this would impress upon other European powers the importance of consultation with Germany on imperial issues: the fact that France had not considered it necessary to make a bilateral agreement with Germany over Morocco rankled, especially given Germany was deeply insecure about its newly acquired Great Power status.  Hence Germany opted for an increase in belligerent rhetoric and, theatrically, Kaiser Wilhelm II dramatically interrupted a Mediterranean cruise to visit Tangier, where he declared Germany's support for the Sultan's independence and integrity of his kingdom, turning Morocco overnight into an international 'crisis.' <ref> Heather Jones, \"Algeciras Revisited: European Crisis and Conference Diplomacy, 16 January-7 April 1906.\" (EUI WorkingPaper MWP 2009/1, 2009),\n p 5 [http://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/10527/MWP_2009_01.pdf?...1 online]</ref>\n\nThe German adventure resulted in failure and frustration, as military cooperation and friendship between France and Britain was strengthened, and Germany was left more isolated.  An even more momentous consequence was the heightened sense of frustration and readiness for war in Germany.  It spread beyond the political elite to much of the press and most of the political parties except for the Liberals and Social Democrats on the left.  The Pan-German element grew in strength and denounced their government's retreat as treason, stepping up chauvinistic support for war. <ref>Immanuel Geiss, ''German Foreign Policy 1871 \u2013 1914'' (1976) 133-36. </ref>\n\n===First World War===\n{{main article|German entry into World War I|Causes of World War I|Diplomatic history of World War I}}\n\nEthnic groups demanded their own nation states, threatening violence. This  upset the stability of multinational empires (Germany, Russia, Austria-Hungary, Turkey/Ottoman).  When ethnic Serbians assassinate the Austrian heir, Austria decided to heavily punish Serbia. Germany stood behind its ally Austria in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the informal protection of Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and in 1915 Italy.<ref>Ren\u00e9 Albrecht-Carri\u00e9, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1958), pp 299-332.</ref>\n\nIn explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, Kennedy (1980) recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a profound moral and diplomatic crime.  Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870 \u2014 when Prussia and the German states smashed France \u2014 would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security.<ref>{{cite book | first=Paul M. |last=Kennedy | title=The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860\u20131914 | url=https://archive.org/details/riseofanglogerma0000kenn | url-access=registration | year=1980 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/riseofanglogerma0000kenn/page/464 464\u2013470]}}</ref>\n\n===German war goals===\nThe Germans never finalized a set of war aims.  However, in September 1914, [[Kurt Riezler]], a senior staff aide to German Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] sketched out some possible ideas --dubbed by historians the \"[[Septemberprogramm|September Program]].\" It emphasized economic gains, turning all of Central and Western Europe into a common market controlled by and for the benefit of Germany Belgium would become a vassal state, there would be a series of naval bases threatening England, Germany would seize  much of Eastern Europe from Russia \u2013 as in fact it did in early 1918. There would be a crippling financial indemnity on France making it economically dependent on Germany. The Netherlands would become a dependent satellite, and British commerce would be excluded. Germany would rebuild a colonial empire in Africa.  The ideas sketched by Riezler were not fully formulated, were not endorsed by Bethmann-Hollweg, and were not presented to or approved by any official body. The ideas were formulated  on the run after the war began, and did not mean these ideas had been reflected a prewar plan, as historian [[Fritz Fischer]] fallaciously assumed. However they do indicate that if Germany had won it would have taken a very aggressive dominant position in Europe. Indeed it took a very harsh position on occupied Belgian and France starting in 1914, and in the [[Treaty of Brest Litovsk]] imposed on Russia in 1918.<ref> Tombs, '' The English and their history '' (2014) p 611. </ref><ref>Wayne C. Thompson,  \"The September Program: Reflections on the Evidence.\" ''Central European History'' 11.4 (1978): 348-354.</ref>\n\nThe stalemate by the end of 1914 forced serious consideration of long-term goals.  Britain, France, Russia and Germany  all separately concluded this was not a traditional war with limited goals. Britain, France and Russia became committed to the destruction of German military power, and Germany to the dominance of German military power in Europe. One month into the war, Britain, France and Russia agreed not to make a separate peace with Germany, and discussions began about  enticing other countries to join in return for territorial gains.  However, as Barbara Jelavich observes, \"Throughout the war Russian actions were carried out without real coordination or joint planning with the Western powers.\"<ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet foreign policy, 1814-1974'' (1974) pp. 281\u201384.</ref> There was no serious three-way coordination of strategy, nor was there  much coordination  between Britain and France before 1917.\n\n==1919\u20131933==\n{{Main|Interwar period}}\n===Weimar Republic===\nThe humiliating peace terms in the Treaty of Versailles provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime since Paul von Hindenburg the president of Weimar Republic used article 48 to gain emergency power hence undermining democracy.\n\nWhen Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to [[passive resistance]]: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal-mines would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the Ruhr fight also led to [[hyperinflation]], and many who lost all their fortune would become bitter enemies of the Weimar Republic, and voters of the anti-democratic right. See [[1920s German inflation]].\n\nGermany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded the Soviet Union ''de jure'' recognition, and the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.  In October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rheinland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.<ref>Wolfgang Elz, \"Foreign policy\" in Anthony McElligott, ed.,  ''Weimar Germany'' (2009)  pp 50-77</ref>\n\n====Nazi era, 1933-39====\n{{main article|Causes of World War II}}\nHitler came to power in January 1933, and inaugurated an aggressive power designed to give Germany economic and political domination across central Europe.  He did not attempt to recover the lost colonies.  Until August 1939, the Nazis announced Communists and the Soviet Union is the greatest enemy, along with the Jews.\n\n[[File:1938 Naka yoshi sangoku.jpg|145px|thumb|left|Japanese poster promoting the [[Axis Powers|Axis cooperation]] in 1938]]\nHitler's diplomatic strategy in the 1930s was to make seemingly reasonable demands, threatening war if they were not met. When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the [[League of Nations]] (1933), rejected the [[Versailles Treaty]] and began to re-arm (1935), won back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance (\"axis\") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339), seized Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French ''appeasement'' of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland in September 1939. Britain and France declared war and [[World War II]] began&nbsp;\u2013 somewhat sooner than the Nazis expected or were ready for.<ref>Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''Hitler's foreign policy 1933-1939: The road to World War II.'' (2013), Originally published in two volumes.</ref>\n\nAfter establishing the \"Rome-Berlin axis\" with [[Benito Mussolini]], and signing the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] with Japan&nbsp;\u2013 which was joined by Italy a year later in 1937&nbsp;\u2013 Hitler felt able to take the offensive in foreign policy. On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered [[Vienna]], he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation ([[Anschluss]]) of their country Austria to the [[German Reich]]. After Austria, Hitler turned to [[Czechoslovakia]], where the 3.5&nbsp;million-strong [[Sudeten German]] minority was demanding equal rights and self-government. At the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Conference]] of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by [[Czechoslovakia]]. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between [[Slovak people|Slovak]]s and [[Czechs]] as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. In the same month, he secured the return of [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel]] from [[Lithuania]] to Germany. Chamberlain was forced to acknowledge that his policy of [[appeasement]] towards Hitler had failed.\n\n===World War II===\n{{main article|Diplomatic history of World War II#Germany}}\n\nGermany's foreign policy during the war involved the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin.<ref>Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''A world at arms: a global history of World War II'' (1995), provides a thorough diplomatic history.</ref> A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies, such as Italy and Hungary, and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as [[Vichy France]].<ref>Mark Mazower, ''Hitler's Empire: How the Nazis Ruled Europe'' (2009) ch 9</ref>  By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary.<ref>Gerhard L. Weinberg, ''A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II'' (2005) p 414</ref>  When a country was no longer dependable, Germany would assume full control, as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943, and Hungary in 1944. Full control allowed the Nazis to achieve their high priority of mass murdering all Jewish population. Although Japan was officially a powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little coordination or cooperation, such as Germany's refusal to share the secret formula for making synthetic oil from coal until late in the war.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bernd Martin|title=Japan and Germany in the Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_jBOpYASMQC&pg=PA280|year=2005|publisher=Berghahn Books|pages=279\u201380}}</ref>\n\nHitler devoted most of his attention during the war to military and diplomatic affairs.  DiNardo argues that in Europe Germany's foreign-policy was dysfunctional during the war, as Hitler treated each ally separately, and refused to create any sort of combined staff that would synchronize policies, armaments, and strategies.  Italy, Finland, Romania, and Hungary each dealt with Berlin separately, and never coordinated their activities. Germany was reluctant to share its powerful weapons systems, or to train Axis officers. There were some exceptions, such as the close collaboration between the German and Italian forces in North Africa.<ref>Richard L. DiNardo, \"The dysfunctional coalition: The axis powers and the eastern front in World War II,\" ''Journal of Military History'' (1996) 60#4 pp&nbsp;711\u2013730</ref><ref>Richard L. DiNardo, ''Germany and the Axis Powers: From Coalition to Collapse'' (2005)</ref>\n\n===Postwar===\n{{Main article|History of Germany (1945\u20131990)}}\n\nSince 1951, Germany has been at the heart of European integration. The reunification in 1990, which saw East Germany merged into West Germany, promoted peaceful integration with its neighbors. Strong ties with the United States remain central to German foreign policy.\n\nWithin the framework of NATO and an integrated [[European Union Military Staff]], the Federal Republic has resumed the deployment of military units to mediate in conflict regions worldwide.\n\nGermany is one of the world's strongest supporters for ecological awareness in response to [[climate change]] and [[global warming]].\n\n===1945\u20131990===\n;Westbindung\n\"Bindung\" is the German word for ''fixation'' or ''bond''; \"Westbindung\" is Germany's implant into Europe and the Western World.\n\nIn particular during the [[Cold War]] \u2013 but continuous into the 21st century \u2013 (West-) German foreign policy pursues the country's integration into NATO and a strong co-operation and [[collective security]] with its Western partners.\n\nAs a free democracy and market economy, the world's largest exporting nation and the world's [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|third-richest economy]] (nominal GDP) (behind the U.S. and Japan), Germany shares the interest and institutions of a [[Free trade|free]] and secure world trade.\n\n;Ostpolitik\n{{Main article|Ostpolitik}}\n\nUnder the [[Hallstein Doctrine]], the FRG did not have any diplomatic relations with countries in [[Eastern Bloc]] until the early 1970s, when [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''Ostpolitik'' led to increased dialogue and treaties like the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]], where West Germany accepted the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as German-Polish border, and the [[Basic Treaty, 1972|Basic Treaty]], where West and East Germany accepted each other as sovereign entities. Both Germany states were admitted to the United Nations on 18 September 1973.\n\n==== German Question and German Problem ====\nEver since the creation of the consolidated German nation state in 1871, the German Problem as to what interests, ambitions, and borders Germany would have and how it would fit into the international system, was a major concern not just for the neighbours but also for German policy-makers themselves. This Problem was temporarily suspended during the Cold War as with Germany being a divided nation, the question as to how to reunify the country (the German Question) would take precedence over other considerations. During the Cold War, both Germanys also lacked the power to challenge the system more generally.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Blumenau |first1=Bernhard  |year=2018 |chapter=German foreign policy and the \"German Problem\" during and after the Cold War |editors=B Blumenau, J Hanhim\u00e4ki, B Zanchetta |title=New Perspectives on the End of the Cold War |pages=92\u2013116 |location=London |publisher=Routledge |doi=10.4324/9781315189031-6 |isbn=9781315189031}}</ref>\n\n===1990\u2013present===\n{{Main article|German reunification}}\n[[File:33rdG8Leaders.jpg|thumb|Leaders of the 33rd G8 summit in [[Heiligendamm]], Germany]]\n\nAfter the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]] and the [[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany]], German reunification took effect on 3 October 1990.\n\nOn 14 November 1990, Germany and [[Poland]] signed a treaty confirming the [[Oder-Neisse line]].
