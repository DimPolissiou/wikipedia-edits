He subsequently studied at the [[University of Leipzig]] with [[Karl Brugmann]], [[Eduard Sievers]], [[Ernst Windisch]], and [[August Leskien]].\n\nIn the fall of 1893, Pedersen enrolled at the University of Berlin, where he studied with [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]]. The following year he studied Celtic languages and Sanskrit with [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)|Heinrich Zimmer]] at the [[University of Greifswald]].\n\nIn 1895 he spent several months in the [[Aran Islands]] in Ireland to study the conservative form of [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] spoken there.\n\nPedersen submitted his doctoral dissertation to the University of Copenhagen in 1896. It dealt with [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] in [[Irish language|Irish]]. It was accepted and published in 1897. The dissertation committee included Vilhelm Thomsen and [[Otto Jespersen]].\n\nAlso in 1897, Pedersen took a position as a lecturer on [[Celtic languages]] at the University of Copenhagen. In 1900 he became a reader in [[historical linguistics|comparative grammar]] there. In 1902 he was offered a professorship at the [[University of Basel]], which he declined, but was able at the same time to persuade the University of Copenhagen to establish an extraordinary professorship for him (Koerner 1983:xii). Pedersen also turned down the offer in 1908 of a professorship at the [[University of Strasbourg|University of Strassburg]] (ib.). Following the retirement of Vilhelm Thomsen in 1912, Pedersen acceded to Thomsen's [[professor|chair]] at the University of Copenhagen. He remained at the University of Copenhagen for the rest of his life.\n\n== Contributions to linguistics ==\n\nIn 1893, Pedersen traveled to [[Corfu]] with Karl Brugmann to study [[Albanian language|Albanian]] in place. Subsequently, Pedersen published a volume of Albanian texts collected on this journey (1895). The publication was due to the recommendation of Brugmann and Leskien (Koerner 1983:x). He continued to publish work on Albanian for many years thereafter. Pedersen's work on Albanian is often cited in [[Vladimir Orel]]'s ''Albanian Etymological Dictionary'' (1995).\n\nAmong students of the [[Celtic languages]] Pedersen is best known for his ''Vergleichende Grammatik der keltischen Sprachen'', 'Comparative Grammar of the Celtic Languages', which is still regarded as the principal reference work in Celtic [[historical linguistics]].\n\nHis ''Hittitisch und die anderen indoeurop\u00e4ischen Sprachen'', 'Hittite and the Other Indo-European Languages', represented a significant step forward in Hittite studies, and is often relied on in Friedrich's ''Hethitisches Elementarbuch'' (2d ed. 1960), the standard handbook of [[Hittite language|Hittite]].\n\nAlso influential was his ''Tocharisch vom Gesichtspunkt der indoeurop\u00e4ischen Sprachvergleichung'', 'Tocharian from the Viewpoint of Indo-European Language Comparison'. For example, [[Andr\u00e9 Martinet]] (2005:179n) states that his discussion of sound changes in [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] is \"''fond\u00e9 sur la pr\u00e9sentation du tokharien par Holger Pedersen'',\" 'based on the presentation of Tocharian by Holger Pedersen'.\n\nIt was Pedersen who formulated the [[Ruki sound law|ruki]] law, an important sound change in [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]].\n\nHe is also known for the description of [[Pedersen's law|Pedersen's Law]], a type of accentual shift occurring in Baltic and Slavic languages (1933a).\n\nPedersen endorsed the [[laryngeal theory]] (1893:292) at a time when it \"was regarded as an eccentric fancy of outsiders\" (Szemer\u00e9nyi 1996:123). In his classic exposition of the theory, [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]] (1935:148) credits Pedersen as one of those who contributed most to its development, along with [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Hermann M\u00f6ller]], and [[Albert Cuny]].\n\nTwo of Pedersen's theories have been receiving considerable attention in recent times after decades of neglect, often known today under the names of the [[glottalic theory]] and the [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] theory.\n\n== Origin of the glottalic theory ==\n\nIn a work published in 1951, Pedersen pointed out that the frequency of ''b'' in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] is abnormally low. Comparison of languages, however, shows that it would be normal if it had once been the equivalent voiceless [[stop consonant|stop]] ''p'', which is infrequent or absent in many languages.\n\nHe also posited that the Indo-European voiced aspirates, ''bh dh gh'', could be better understood as voiceless aspirates, ''ph th kh''.\n\nPedersen therefore proposed that the three stop series of Indo-European, ''p t k'', ''bh dh gh'', and ''b d g'', had at an earlier time been ''b d g'', ''ph th kh'', and ''(p) t k'', with the voiceless and voiced non-aspirates reversed.\n\nThis theory attracted relatively little attention until the American linguist [[Paul Hopper]] (1973) and the two Soviet scholars [[Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav V. Ivanov]] proposed, in a series of articles culminating in a major work by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov published in 1984 (English translation 1995), that the Indo-European ''b d g'' series had originally been a [[ejective consonant|glottalized]] series, ''p' t' k'.'' Under this form, the theory has attracted wide interest. There seems to be a good chance that it will endure in one form or another.\n\n== Origin of the Nostratic theory ==\n\nPedersen seems to have first used the term \"Nostratic\" in an article on Turkish phonology published in 1903. The kernel of Pedersen's argument for Nostratic in that article was as follows (1903:560-561; \"Indo-Germanic\" = Indo-European):\n\n::Gr\u00f8nbech considers it possible p. 69 that the Turkish word for \"goose\" could be borrowed from Indo-Germanic (Osm. ''kaz'' Yak. ''x\u0101s'' Chuv. ''xur''). There are in my view three possibilities with regard to this word: coincidence, borrowing, and kinship. One must also reckon with this last possibility. Very many language stocks in Asia are without doubt related to the Indo-Germanic one; this is perhaps valid for all those languages which have been characterized as Ural\u2013Altaic. I would like to unite all the language stocks related to Indo-Germanic under the name \"Nostratic languages.\" The Nostratic languages occupy not only a very large area in Europe and Asia but also extend to within Africa; for the Semitic-Hamitic languages are in my view without doubt Nostratic. With regard to the proof of the relationship of the Nostratic languages, not only must all root etymologies and in general all etymological frivolities be kept at a distance, but one should in general not concern oneself with heaping up a mass of material. One should rather limit oneself to the rational consideration of a series of pronouns, negatives, in part also numerals which can be traced through several language stocks (in Turkish one is reminded of the Indo-Germanic by the negation ''-ma'', ''-m\u00e4'' and the word-initial interrogative particle ''m'', the interrogative pronoun ''kim'', the pronoun of the first person ''m\u00e4n'', the verbal ending of the 1. sing. ''-m'', 1. plur. ''-myz'', ''-miz'' and the ending ''-jin'' in the 1. sing. of the \"optative,\" very reminiscent of the Indo-Germanic subjunctive [with the optative affix ''-a-'', ''-\u00e4-''], the pronoun of the 2. sing. ''s\u00e4n'' [cp. the IdG. verbal ending ''-s''], the causative formation with ''-tur-'' [cp. IdG. ''-t\u014dr'' nomen agentis; the Indo-Germanic causative also appears as if it were derived from a nomina agentis of the \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 type], the nomina actionis like Orkh. ''k\u00e4d-im'' \"clothing,\" several numerals: Orkh. ''jiti'' \"7,\" ''jitm-i\u0161'' \"70,\" [with ''j'' = IdG. ''s'' as in Proto-Turk. *''jib-'' \"approach,\" Osm. ''jyldyz'' \"Star\": to Indo-Germanic word for \"sun,\" ''jat-'' \"lie\": IdG. word for \"sit\"]; Proto-Turk. ''b\u01df\u0161'' \"5\" [with ''\u0161'' = IdG. ''-q<sup>u</sup>e''; cp. Osm. ''pi\u0161-'' \"be cooked,\" IdG. *''peq<sup>u</sup>eti'' \"cooks\"] etc., etc.). I resist the temptation to enter into this question in more detail.\n\nPedersen\u2019s last sentence should be understood as referring to the article he was writing, not the rest of his career. Although he defined the Nostratic family, he himself never produced the work of synthesis the concept seemed to call for. That would await the work of the Russian scholars [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych|Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky|Dolgopolsky]] in the 1960s for its first iteration. Nevertheless, Pedersen did not abandon the subject. He produced a substantial (if overlooked) article on Indo-European and Semitic in 1908. He produced a detailed argument in favor of the kinship of Indo-European and Uralic in 1933. In effect, the three pillars of the Nostratic hypothesis are [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]], [[Ural\u2013Altaic languages|Ural\u2013Altaic]], and [[Hermann M\u00f6ller|Indo-Semitic]]. Pedersen produced works on two of these three, so the impression is incorrect that he neglected this subject in his subsequent career. His interest in the Nostratic idea remained constant amid his many other activities as a linguist.\n\nEnglish \"Nostratic\" is the normal equivalent of German ''nostratisch'', the form used by Pedersen in 1903, and Danish ''nostratisk'' (compare French ''nostratique''). His 1931 American translator rendered ''nostratisk'' by \"Nostratian,\" but this form did not catch on.\n\nIn his 1931 book, Pedersen defined Nostratic as follows (1931:338):\n\n::As a comprehensive designation for the families of languages which are related to Indo-European, we may employ the expression ''Nostratian languages'' (from Latin ''nostr\u0101s'' \"our countryman\").\n\nIn his view, [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] was most clearly related to [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], with \"similar, though fainter, resemblances\" to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], and [[Manchu language|Manchu]]; to [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]]; and to [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Eskimo]] (1931:338). He also considered Indo-European might be related to [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and that, if so, it must be related to [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Hamitic]] and possibly to [[Basque language|Basque]] (ib.).\n\nIn modern terms, we would say he was positing [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] between Indo-European and the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], Yukaghir, Eskimo, and [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language families. (The existence of the Altaic family is controversial, and few would now assign Basque to Afro-Asiatic.)\n\nHowever, in Pedersen's view the languages listed did not exhaust the possibilities for Nostratic (ib.):\n\n::The boundaries for the Nostratian world of languages cannot yet be determined, but the area is enormous, and includes such widely divergent races that one becomes almost dizzy at the thought. (...) The question remains simply whether sufficient material can be collected to give this inclusion flesh and blood and a good clear outline.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n1893. \"Das Pr\u00e4sensinfix ''n'',\" in ''Indogermanische Forschungen'' 2, 285-332.\n\n1895.

(The existence of the Altaic family is controversial, and few would now assign Basque to Afro-Asiatic.)\n\nHowever, in Pedersen's view the languages listed did not exhaust the possibilities for Nostratic (ib.):\n\n::The boundaries for the Nostratian world of languages cannot yet be determined, but the area is enormous, and includes such widely divergent races that one becomes almost dizzy at the thought. (...) The question remains simply whether sufficient material can be collected to give this inclusion flesh and blood and a good clear outline.\n\n== Bibliography ==\n1893. \"Das Pr\u00e4sensinfix ''n'',\" in ''Indogermanische Forschungen'' 2, 285-332.\n\n1895.

The emirate was initially based in [[Kafartab]] before the Banu Munqidh took over the fortress of [[Shaizar|Shayzar]] in 1081 and made it their headquarters for the remainder of their rule. The capture of Shayzar was the culmination of a long, drawn out process beginning with the Banu Munqidh's nominal assignment to the land by the [[Salih ibn Mirdas|Mirdasid emir]] of [[Aleppo]] in 1025, and accelerating with the weakened grip of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule in northern Syria in the 1070s. \n\nUnder the reign of Emir Ali ibn Muqallad (r. 1059\u20131082), the Banu Munqidh reached their territorial peak with the emirate extending from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port of [[Latakia]] to [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]]. The [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] conquest of Syria in 1085 and subsequent struggles with local Muslim lords reduced the Munqidh emirate to Shayzar and its environs. Under Emir Sultan ibn Ali (r. 1098\u20131154), the Banu Munqidh alternated between combating the [[Crusaders]] who landed in Syria in 1099 and paying tribute to them. During this period, the family also had to contend with [[Nizari Ismaili state|Ismai'li]] newcomers encroaching on their domains. To firmly protect the emirate, Sultan ultimately put the Banu Munqidh under [[Zengid dynasty|Zengid]] suzerainty. After the death of Emir Muhammad ibn Sultan (r. 1154\u20131157) and his family, the emirate passed to the Zengid emir [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]], who granted it to the [[Banu al-Daya]] family.\n\nThrough a combination of wealth, diplomatic acumen and military skills, the Banu Munqidh survived as a local power and successfully resisted attempts by the Crusaders and stronger Syrian Muslim dynasties to seize their strategic fortress in Shayzar. Among their allies and enemies alike, the Banu Munqidh gained a reputation for \"martial valor, honor, piety and courtly refinement\" in the words of historian Adnan Husain. Their rural lands, which were largely populated by [[Greek Orthodox Christian]]s, were distinguished for their well-kept and prosperous state. From early on, the family was also known to provide refuge for a wide array of people, ranging from Muslim refugees fleeing Crusader assaults or exiled Muslim generals, officials and other dignitaries. The most well-known member of the family, [[Usama ibn Munqidh]] (1095\u20131188), went on to have to have a proficient career in literature and diplomacy serving the courts of the Zengids, [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]]s and [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]]s.\n\n==History==\n===Emergence===\nThe Banu Munqidh were an [[Arab]] family belonging to the Kinana branch of the [[Banu Kalb]] tribe.<ref name=\"Humphreys577\">Humphreys 1993, p. 577.</ref><ref name=\"Kennedy6\">Kennedy 2012, p.6.</ref> Though the Banu Kalb were largely concentrated around Damascus in the late 10th century, the Kinana inhabited the eastern environs of the [[Orontes River]] in northern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]].<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> A member of the family, Ali ibn Munqidh ibn Nasr al-Kinani, is first mentioned in 960 when he was taken captive by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s during a major [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] defeat; also taken prisoner was the poet and governor [[Abu Firas al-Hamdani]].<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> \n\nIt was not until the 11th century that the Banu Munqidh emerged in regional politics.<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> At that time, the family entered the service of [[Salih ibn Mirdas]], founder of the [[Aleppo]]-based [[Mirdasid dynasty]].<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> According to historian Suhayl Zakkar, the Banu Munqidh were numerous and strong enough at the time to \"play an influential role in the life of the Mirdasid dynasty\".<ref name=\"Zakkar85\">Zakkar 1971, p. 85.</ref> Upon capturing Aleppo in 1025, Salih granted the Munqhidi chieftain, Muqallad ibn Nasr ibn Munqidh, the lands around [[Shayzar]] as an ''[[iqta|iq\u1e6d\u0101\u02bf]]'' (fief); the town of Shayzar itself was in Byzantine hands, however.<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/><ref name=\"Kennedy6\"/> With their assignment to Shayzar being in name only, the Banu Munqidh instead used [[Kafartab]] as their headquarters.<ref name=\"Kennedy6\"/><ref name=\"Zakkar85\"/>\n\n===Reign of Ali===\nMuqallad died in 1059, after which his son Ali inherited his ''iqta\u02bf''.<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> Under Ali, the Banu Munqidh played a dominant role in the affairs of their nominal Mirdasid suzerains.<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> Tensions with the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo, [[Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud|Mahmud ibn Nasr]], led Ali to depart Aleppo for [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] where he was able to gain further recognition of the Banu Munqidh's budding principality in the middle Orontes valley.<ref name=\"Bianqis121\">Bianqis 1993, p. 121.</ref> During the chaotic succession process following Mahmud's death, Ali was instrumental in installing Mahmud's son Sabiq as Aleppo's emir.<ref name=\"Bianqis121\"/> However, Sabiq's succession was opposed by the other members of the Mirdasid house and the [[Banu Kilab]] tribe to whom they belonged who favored Sabiq's brother Waththab.<ref name=\"Bianqis121\"/> After a number of major battles between the opposing sides and amid severe famine in Aleppo, [[Muslim ibn Quraysh]], the [[Uqaylid dynasty|Uqaylid]] emir of [[Mosul]] saw an opportunity to take the city.<ref name=\"Bianqis122\">Bianqis 1993, p. 121.</ref> In the aftermath of his entry into Aleppo in 1080 and the refusal of the Mirdasids to surrender the citadel, Ali intervened to mediate between the two sides.<ref name=\"Bianqis122\"/> Ultimately, Ali facilitated the city's surrender to Muslim in return for the allotment of ''iq\u1e6d\u0101\u02bfat'' to the Mirdasids in Aleppo's hinterland.<ref name=\"Bianqis122\"/>\n\n====Struggle for Shayzar====\n[[File:Shayzar3.jpg|right|thumb|The fortress of [[Shaizar|Shayzar]] became the headquarters of the Banu Munqidh between 1080 until the citadel's collapse and the family's consequent demise in the [[1157 Hama earthquake|1157 earthquake]] ]]\n\nMeanwhile, the Banu Munqidh led renewed efforts to capture the Shayzar fortress in what historian [[Hugh N. Kennedy]] described as a \u201clong, drawn out process\u201d.<ref name=\"Kennedy6\"/> The catalyst of these efforts was the weakening grip of the Byzantines in northern Syria following their defeat by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Sultanate]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071.<ref name=\"Kennedy6\"/> In 1076, Ali began construction of the Hisn al-Jisr fortress, which would limit Shayzar's access to the Orontes River.<ref name=\"Kennedy6-7\">Kennedy 2012, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Hisn al-Jisr was used to hamper the flow of supplies into Shayzar from the Byzantine mainland.<ref name=\"Kennedy6\"/> At the time, it was also utilized by Ali for diplomatic efforts amid the struggle for Syria between the ascendant Seljuks and their opponents.<ref name=\"Kennedy7\">Kennedy 2012, p. 7.</ref> In 1078/79, he sheltered the families of the Seljuks\u2019 Turkish opponents from Aleppo and he hosted the Seljuk general Afshin, persuading him to spare both Kafartab and Byzantine Shayzar from his pillaging.<ref name=\"Kennedy7\"/> These were early demonstrations of how \u201cdiplomatic skills, more than military power, enabled the Banu Munqidh to maintain their precarious independence\u201d, according to Kennedy.<ref name=\"Kennedy7\"/>\n\nThe Banu Munqidh's pressure on Shayzar compelled its Byzantine rulers to surrender the fortress to Ali in December 1081 in exchange for a certain sum and guarantees of upkeep of the town bishop's home.<ref name=\"Kennedy7\"/> Shayzar became the center of the Munqidh emirate (principality).<ref name=\"Humphreys578\">Humphreys 1993, p. 578.</ref> The family under Ali soon after faced a siege by the Uqaylids but leveraged their significant wealth to settle with Muslim ibn Quraysh.<ref name=\"Kennedy8\">Kennedy 2012, p. 8.</ref> By the time of Ali's death in 1082, the Banu Munqidh's emirate, now under Ali's son Sadid al-Mulk, extended to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port town of [[Latakia]] and included [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]] and a few smaller places, in addition to Shayzar and Kafartab.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/>\n\n===Reign of Nasr===\nSadid al-Mulk was succeeded by his son Nasr.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> The principal challenge the Banu Munqidh faced during Nasr's reign was the expansion of Seljuk rule into Syria.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> Like their previous encounter with the Uqaylids, the family employed the same strategy to stave off an attack by the Seljuk ruler [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Sulayman ibn Qutulmush]] in 1085.<ref name=\"Kennedy8\"/> Moreover, Nasr's conviction that the Seljuks could not be defeated led him to cede his family's territories in Latakia, Apamea and Kafartab to the sultanate in exchange for their firm recognition of the Banu Munqidh's possession of Shayzar in 1086/87.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> Through his good offices with the Seljuk ruler of Aleppo, he was able to return the ceded towns to the Banu Munqidh in 1091.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> However, in 1096 Apamea and Kafartab were lost to the family's Arab rival, Khalaf ibn Mula'ib, the formerly semi-independent lord of [[Homs]].<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/><ref name=\"Cobb11\">Cobb 2005, p. 11.</ref> Ibn Mula'ib was a former subordinate of Nasr who he gradually had to contend with as a frequently hostile neighbor of the Banu Munqidh.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/><ref name=\"Cobb11\"/> In one encounter, Nasr was badly defeated in an ambush by Ibn Mula'ib during an attack outside Shayzar.<ref name=\"Cobb11\"/>\n\n===Reign of Sultan===\n[[File:Siege de Shaizar (1138).jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of [[John II Komnenos|John II]]\u2019s Byzantine-Crusader coalition [[Siege of Shaizar|siege of Shayzar]] in 1138, French manuscript 1338.]]\n\nIn 1098, Nasr ibn Ali died and the lordship of Shayzar passed to his sons. For unknown reasons, Nasr's brother and chosen successor, Murshid,<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> withdrew himself from the line of succession in favor of his younger brother Sultan,<ref>Husain 2011, pp. 193\u2013194.</ref> who had served as the Banu Munqidh's governor in Latakia.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> Murshid maintained a prominent leadership role as his then-childless brother's deputy.<ref name=\"Husain194\">Husain 2011, p. 194.</ref> At the turn of the 11th century, the Banu Munqidh's possessions were under threat not only by their Turkish suzerains, but also the encroachments of the Banu Kilab, the growing presence of the [[Nizari Ismaili state|Nizari Ismaili]]s in the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range|coastal mountains of northern Syria]] and the newly arrived [[Crusades|Crusaders]].<ref>Kennedy 2012, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> \n\nDuring Sultan's reign, the Banu Munqidh had become more numerous and Sultan chiefly depended on his own kinsmen in confrontations with the constellation of powers, local and regional, that controlled northern Syria.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> He could also rely on his Kinana tribesmen to an extent and the militiamen of Shayzar.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> To a much lesser extent the family recruited [[Kurds|Kurdish]] mercenaries and Turkish ''[[mamluk]]s'' (slave soldiers).<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> Meanwhile, a tentative alliance was formed with Ibn Mula'ib despite the wounding of Sultan and Murshid in a battle with him in 1104.<ref name=\"Cobb11\"/> Together, the Banu Munqidh and Ibn Mula'ib attacked a small Crusader-held fort in their region in 1106, but Ibn Mula'ib betrayed the Banu Munqidh by deserting and stealing their horses.<ref name=\"Cobb11\"/> Before the family could retaliate, Ibn Mula'ib was killed by an Ismai'il assassin.<ref name=\"Cobb11\"/> At this time, friendly relations were also established with the family's other erstwhile rivals, the Turkish Ibn Qaraja emirs of Hama and Homs.<ref name=\"Cobb12\">Cobb 2005, p. 12.</ref>\n\nThe principal Crusader threat to the Banu Munqidh was posed by the neighboring [[Principality of Antioch]].<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> The prince of Antioch, Tancred, attacked and plundered the Banu Munqidh's emirate in 1110 and imposed a heavy tribute on Shayzar, a testament to its wealth at the time.<ref name=\"Kennedy10\">Kennedy 2012, p. 10.</ref> The following year, Tancred built the Tell Ibn Ma'shar fortress along the west bank of the Orontes, across from Shayzar,<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> to prepare an assault against the city.<ref name=\"Kennedy10\"/> Sultan reached out to [[Mawdud]] of Mosul to prevent this, while Tancred gathered a larger Crusader coalition including the rulers of Jerusalem and Tripoli.<ref name=\"Kennedy10\"/> In the ensuing [[Battle of Shaizar|Battle of Shayzar]], which was according to Kennedy was more of \"a prolonged confrontation\" than a battle, the Crusader armies retreated in October 1111.<ref name=\"Kennedy11\">Kennedy 2012, p. 11.</ref> However, the Banu Munqidh continued paying the annual tribute to Antioch.<ref name=\"Kennedy11\"/>\n\nShayzar also became a target of the Isma'ili sect subsequent to their exodus from Syria's major cities to the coastal mountains.<ref name=\"Kennedy9\">Kennedy 2012, p. 9.</ref> They attempted to seize Shayzar in 1114 while the Banu Munqidh family were away participating in the Easter celebrations of their Orthodox Christian subjects.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/><ref name=\"Kennedy9\"/> The attack was coordinated with the town's Isma'ili residents, who had been generally well-treated by the Banu Munqidh.<ref name=\"Kennedy9\"/> About one hundred Isma'ilis seized the citadel, expelling its residents.<ref name=\"Kennedy9\"/> A bloody struggle ensued upon the Banu Munqidh's return to Shayzar, and involved the participation of the family's women.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> It ended with the slaying of all the Ismai'ili attackers and the enactment of certain measures to prevent a recurrence.<ref name=\"Kennedy9\"/> The following year, a Muslim\u2013Crusader coalition composed of Roger of Antioch, Toghtekin of Damascus and Ilghazi of Mardin besieged Shayzar in response to the plans of the Banu Munqidh's ally Mawdud of Mosul to conquer Syria.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/>\n\n====Suzerainty of the Zengids====\nIn 1127 Sultan put the Banu Munqidh under the suzerainty of the ascendant Muslim ruler of Mosul and Aleppo, [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]], which allowed for a greater level of security for the family's domains.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> This was interrupted by a short siege of Shayzar by the Burid ruler of Damascus, Shams al-Mulk Isma'il, in 1133 and a greater crisis by the Byzantine\u2013Crusader [[Siege of Shaizar|siege of Shayzar]] in 1138 led by \n[[John II Komnenos]].<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/><ref name=\"Kennedy11\"/> The Byzantine-led army initially attacked the Banu Munqidh-held forts of Kafartab and Hisn al-Jisr, causing their inhabitants to flee, before proceeding in their assault against Shayzar.<ref name=\"Kennedy12\">Kennedy 2012, p. 12.</ref> Arabic and Greek sources both indicate that the Banu Munqidh and the people of Shayzar resisted the siege and the Byzantines' catapults for several days before John II's army withdrew.<ref>Kennedy 2012, pp. 15\u201316.</ref> However, the Arabic sources claim the Byzantines left after hearing of the arrival of Zengid reinforcements<ref name=\"Kennedy12\"/> while the Greek sources claim the withdrawal was precipitated by a Zengid attack on Byzantine-held [[Edessa]] and Sultan's offer to pay off John II.<ref>Kennedy 2012, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe domain of the Banu Munqidh entered a long period of stability and prosperity beginning in 1138.<ref name=\"Kennedy16\">Kennedy 2012, p. 16.</ref> Shayzar and it's dependencies remained under the control of Sultan who ruled under the authority of the Zengid dynasty.<ref name=\"Kennedy16\"/> However, in 1140/41 the Ismai'ils captured the fortress of [[Masyaf]] from the Banu Munqidh, who had purchased it in 1127/28.<ref name=\"Lewis109\">Lewis, p. 109.</ref> It thereafter became the Isma'ilis' main stronghold in Syria.<ref name=\"Kennedy17\">Kennedy 2012, p. 17.</ref><ref name=\"Lewis109\"/> This generally peaceful period also coincided with tensions between Sultan and his nephews. Murshid's position as the Banu Munqidh's second highest-ranking leader enabled the latter's sons, including [[Usama ibn Munqidh|Usama]], to rise politically within the emirate.<ref name=\"Husain194\"/> They gained a reputation for their martial and diplomatic skills and Sultan viewed their prominence as a threat to his leadership.<ref name=\"Kennedy16\"/> These tensions culminated after Murshid's death in 1136/37 and the birth of Sultan's son Taj al-Mulk Muhammad in the following year.<ref name=\"Kennedy16\"/><ref name=\"Husain194\"/> As a consequence, Usama and his brothers were exiled from Shayzar,<ref name=\"Husain194\"/> finding asylum with [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]], the Zengid emir of Aleppo.<ref name=\"Kennedy16\"/> After Sultan's death in 1154, Taj al-Mulk Muhammad succeeded him without incident.<ref name=\"Kennedy17\"/> \n\n===Demise===\nMost of the Banu Munqidh, including Taj al-Mulk and his children, died in the collapse of the Shayzar citadel during the [[1157 Hama earthquake|August 1157 earthquake]], which devastated a number of other towns in the area.<ref>Kennedy 2012, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> This brought an end to their rule of the Shayzar principality, which was soon after seized by Nur ad-Din to prevent its capture by the Crusaders.<ref name=\"Kennedy20\">Kennedy 2012, p. 20.</ref> Nur ad-Din did not seek to find any surviving members of the Banu Munqidh to resume their lordship of Shayzar, whose fortifications he had promptly restored.<ref name=\"Kennedy20\"/> Instead, he handed the town over to a certain Sabiq al-Din Uthman ibn al-Daya.<ref name=\"Kennedy20\"/> The latter's family, the Banu al-Daya, remained the lords of Shayzar through [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] rule until 1233.<ref>Tonghini and Montevecci 2006, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Diplomacy and social relations==\n===Relations with the Crusaders===\nThe Banu Munqidh initially reacted to the Crusader invasion of coastal Syria by offering the Crusader king of Jerusalem, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], a tributary arrangement, provisioning of food supplies and protection for Christian pilgrims passing through the family's territory.<ref name=\"Husain192\">Husain 2011, p. 192.</ref> Though the Kingdom of Jerusalem did not border the Banu Munqidh's domains, the neighboring Frankish principality of Antioch was under Jerusalem's overall authority.<ref name=\"Husain192\"/> This accord with the newly arrived Crusaders in [[Ma'arrat al-Nu'man]] spared Shayzar the latter's devastating raids.<ref name=\"Husain192\"/> Intermittent warfare in the form of raids and clashes partly characterized the contact between the Banu Munqidh and the Crusader states, but they largely maintained practical ties.<ref name=\"Husain193\"/> In 1108, a large annual tribute was imposed by the Crusaders on the Banu Munqidh.<ref name=\"Husain193\"/> \n\nIn addition to the financial sums, they also had to provide guides for the emissaries of the neighboring [[Principality of Antioch]] on their way to [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"Husain193\"/> The family was particularly close to King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] (r. 1118\u20131131) and hosted him in Shayzar in 1124 at the request of his Muslim captor and ruler of Aleppo, Timurtash ibn Ilghazi, during negotiations for Baldwin's release.<ref name=\"Husain193\"/><ref name=\"Kohler126\">Kohler, p. 126.</ref> The Munqidhi emirs Sultan and Murshid successfully mediated the ransom for Baldwin's freedom.<ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> Subsequent to his release, Baldwin relieved the Banu Munqidh of their tribute and services in appreciation of their generosity.<ref name=\"Husain193\"/><ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> The bonds forged between the Banu Munqidh and King Baldwin II enabled Usama ibn Munqidh to play a mediating role in the diplomatic negotiations of the early 1130s between Baldwin and [[Taj al-Muluk Buri]], the [[Burid dynasty|Burid]] ruler of [[Damascus]] in whose court Usama served.<ref name=\"Husain193\"/> \n\n===Relations with Muslim states and lordships===\nDespite generally peaceful relations with the Franks, the Banu Munqidh remained loyal to their Muslim suzerains, fighting alongside the Muslim rulers of Aleppo and Damasucs in their battles and campaigns against the Crusaders in 1111, 1115 and 1119.<ref name=\"Kohler125\"/> The family also fended off Crusader attacks against their domains between 1122 and 1124.<ref name=\"Kohler125\"/> The family maintained friendly ties with a number of the semi-independent Muslim lords of other fortress towns who shared their social standing, the Fatimid lord [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]] of [[Abu Qubays, Syria|Abu Qubays]] and the Banu Salim ibn Malik of [[Qal'at Ja'bar]];<ref name=\"Kennedy17\"/><ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> the former's sister was married to Sultan and the emirs of Qal'at Ja'bar shared similar Arab tribal origins as the Banu Munqidh.<ref name=\"Kennedy17\"/><ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> The Banu Munqidh's emirs paid social visits to Iftikhar al-Dawla,<ref name=\"Kennedy17\"/> while keeping frequent contact with Shihab al-Din Salim ibn Malik via letters, couriers and the exchange of gifts.<ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> The emirs of Qal'at Ja'bar played a similar diplomatic role as the Banu Munqidh and both families were described in the Syrian ''Chronicon, A.C. 1234'' as \"a good sort of people, friendly to all and good mediators at any time\".<ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> \n\n===Provision of asylum===\nThe Banu Munqidh often provided asylum for refugees and exiles.<ref name=\"Kohler125\"/> In 1041, they gave temporary refuge in Kafartab to the Fatimid governor of Syria, [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari]], when he was ousted from Damascus and then escorted him safely to the [[Citadel of Aleppo]].<ref name=\"Zakkar85\"/> Later, in the Crusader era, the Banu Munqidh gave refuge to Muslim families fleeing the [[Siege of Ma'arra|siege of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man]] in 1098; the son of their erstwhile rival [[Khalaf ibn Mula'ib]] of Apamea in 1106; the ousted Muslim ruler of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], ''qadi'' Fakhr al-Mulk ibn Ammar, in 1109; and the [[Nizari Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] ''[[da'i]]'' of Aleppo, Ibrahim, when the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] fled Seljuk persecution by [[Alp Arsl\u0101n al-Akhras|Alp Arslan al-Akhras]] in 1113.<ref name=\"Kohler125\"/>\n\n==Recreation==\nBased on the accounts of Usama ibn Munqidh, the family were avid hunters and went on expeditions in the wetlands of Orontes valley west of Shayzar and in the hills south of the city.<ref>Kennedy 2012, pp. 17\u201318.</ref> The expeditions were led by the family's emirs who led retinues containing tens of horsemen,

and partridges.<ref name=\"Kennedy18\"/> However, the ultimate prey of the Munqidhi emirs were lions and leopards, the slaying of which were an apparent symbol and function of the emir's authority.<ref name=\"Kennedy18\"/> According to Kennedy, \"killing lions and leopards\" was \"one of the ways\" an emir \"demonstrated his protection of and care for the people who lived on his lands\".<ref name=\"Kennedy18\"/>\n\n==Assessment==\nThe Banu Munqidh were described as an \"elite, patrician family of well-known warriors who enjoyed a wide reputation for martial valor, honor,

Munqidh ruled a relatively a small emirate largely inhabited by [[Greek Orthodox Christian]]s.<ref name=\"Husain190\">Husain 2011, p. 190.</ref> Throughout their rule, the emirate was surrounded by frequently hostile powers, whether local or regional Muslim lords, Crusader principalities or Bedouin tribes.<ref name=\"Husain191-192\">Husain 2011, pp. 191\u2013192.</ref> In addition to their

The emirate was initially based in [[Kafartab]] before the Banu Munqidh took over the fortress of [[Shaizar|Shayzar]] in 1081 and made it their headquarters for the remainder of their rule. The capture of Shayzar was the culmination of a long, drawn out process beginning with the Banu Munqidh's nominal assignment to the land by the [[Salih ibn Mirdas|Mirdasid emir]] of [[Aleppo]] in 1025, and accelerating with the weakened grip of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule in northern Syria in the 1070s. \n\nUnder the reign of Emir Ali ibn Muqallad (r. 1059\u20131082), the Banu Munqidh reached their territorial peak with the emirate extending from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port of [[Latakia]] to [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]]. The [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] conquest of Syria in 1085 and subsequent struggles with local Muslim lords reduced the Munqidh emirate to Shayzar and its environs. Under Emir Sultan ibn Ali (r. 1098\u20131154), the Banu Munqidh alternated between combating the [[Crusaders]] who landed in Syria in 1099 and paying tribute to them. During this period, the family also had to contend with [[Nizari Ismaili state|Ismai'li]] newcomers encroaching on their domains. To firmly protect the emirate, Sultan ultimately put the Banu Munqidh under [[Zengid dynasty|Zengid]] suzerainty. After the death of Emir Muhammad ibn Sultan (r. 1154\u20131157) and his family, the emirate passed to the Zengid emir [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]], who granted it to the [[Banu al-Daya]] family.\n\nThrough a combination of wealth, diplomatic acumen and military skills, the Banu Munqidh survived as a local power and successfully resisted attempts by the Crusaders and stronger Syrian Muslim dynasties to seize their strategic fortress in Shayzar. Among their allies and enemies alike, the Banu Munqidh gained a reputation for \"martial valor, honor, piety and courtly refinement\" in the words of historian Adnan Husain. Their rural lands, which were largely populated by [[Greek Orthodox Christian]]s, were distinguished for their well-kept and prosperous state. From early on, the family was also known to provide refuge for a wide array of people, ranging from Muslim refugees fleeing Crusader assaults or exiled Muslim generals, officials and other dignitaries. The most well-known member of the family, [[Usama ibn Munqidh]] (1095\u20131188), went on to have to have a proficient career in literature and diplomacy serving the courts of the Zengids, [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]]s and [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]]s.\n\n==History==\n===Emergence===\nThe Banu Munqidh were an [[Arab]] family belonging to the Kinana branch of the [[Banu Kalb]] tribe.<ref name=\"Humphreys577\">Humphreys 1993, p. 577.</ref><ref name=\"Kennedy6\">Kennedy 2012, p.6.</ref> Though the Banu Kalb were largely concentrated around Damascus in the late 10th century, the Kinana inhabited the eastern environs of the [[Orontes River]] in northern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]].<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> A member of the family, Ali ibn Munqidh ibn Nasr al-Kinani, is first mentioned in 960 when he was taken captive by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s during a major [[Hamdanid dynasty|Hamdanid]] defeat; also taken prisoner was the poet and governor [[Abu Firas al-Hamdani]].<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> \n\nIt was not until the 11th century that the Banu Munqidh emerged in regional politics.<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> At that time, the family entered the service of [[Salih ibn Mirdas]], founder of the [[Aleppo]]-based [[Mirdasid dynasty]].<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> According to historian Suhayl Zakkar, the Banu Munqidh were numerous and strong enough at the time to \"play an influential role in the life of the Mirdasid dynasty\".<ref name=\"Zakkar85\">Zakkar 1971, p. 85.</ref> Upon capturing Aleppo in 1025, Salih granted the Munqhidi chieftain, Muqallad ibn Nasr ibn Munqidh, the lands around [[Shayzar]] as an ''[[iqta|iq\u1e6d\u0101\u02bf]]'' (fief); the town of Shayzar itself was in Byzantine hands, however.<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/><ref name=\"Kennedy6\"/> With their assignment to Shayzar being in name only, the Banu Munqidh instead used [[Kafartab]] as their headquarters.<ref name=\"Kennedy6\"/><ref name=\"Zakkar85\"/>\n\n===Reign of Ali===\nMuqallad died in 1059, after which his son Ali inherited his ''iqta\u02bf''.<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> Under Ali, the Banu Munqidh played a dominant role in the affairs of their nominal Mirdasid suzerains.<ref name=\"Humphreys577\"/> Tensions with the Mirdasid emir of Aleppo, [[Rashid al-Dawla Mahmud|Mahmud ibn Nasr]], led Ali to depart Aleppo for [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]] where he was able to gain further recognition of the Banu Munqidh's budding principality in the middle Orontes valley.<ref name=\"Bianqis121\">Bianqis 1993, p. 121.</ref> During the chaotic succession process following Mahmud's death, Ali was instrumental in installing Mahmud's son Sabiq as Aleppo's emir.<ref name=\"Bianqis121\"/> However, Sabiq's succession was opposed by the other members of the Mirdasid house and the [[Banu Kilab]] tribe to whom they belonged who favored Sabiq's brother Waththab.<ref name=\"Bianqis121\"/> After a number of major battles between the opposing sides and amid severe famine in Aleppo, [[Muslim ibn Quraysh]], the [[Uqaylid dynasty|Uqaylid]] emir of [[Mosul]] saw an opportunity to take the city.<ref name=\"Bianqis122\">Bianqis 1993, p. 121.</ref> In the aftermath of his entry into Aleppo in 1080 and the refusal of the Mirdasids to surrender the citadel, Ali intervened to mediate between the two sides.<ref name=\"Bianqis122\"/> Ultimately, Ali facilitated the city's surrender to Muslim in return for the allotment of ''iq\u1e6d\u0101\u02bfat'' to the Mirdasids in Aleppo's hinterland.<ref name=\"Bianqis122\"/>\n\n====Struggle for Shayzar====\n[[File:Shayzar3.jpg|right|thumb|The fortress of [[Shaizar|Shayzar]] became the headquarters of the Banu Munqidh between 1080 until the citadel\u2019s collapse and the family\u2019s consequent demise in the [[1157 Hama earthquake|1157 earthquake]] ]]\n\nMeanwhile, the Banu Munqidh led renewed efforts to capture the Shayzar fortress in what historian [[Hugh N. Kennedy]] described as a \u201clong, drawn out process\u201d.<ref name=\"Kennedy6\"/> The catalyst of these efforts was the weakening grip of the Byzantines in northern Syria following their defeat by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Sultanate]] at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071.<ref name=\"Kennedy6\"/> In 1076, Ali began construction of the Hisn al-Jisr fortress, which would limit Shayzar\u2019s access to the Orontes River.<ref name=\"Kennedy6-7\">Kennedy 2012, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Hisn al-Jisr was used to hamper the flow of supplies into Shayzar from the Byzantine mainland.<ref name=\"Kennedy6\"/> At the time, it was also utilized by Ali for diplomatic efforts amid the struggle for Syria between the ascendant Seljuks and their opponents.<ref name=\"Kennedy7\">Kennedy 2012, p. 7.</ref> In 1078/79, he sheltered the families of the Seljuks\u2019 Turkish opponents from Aleppo and he hosted the Seljuk general Afshin, persuading him to spare both Kafartab and Byzantine Shayzar from his pillaging.<ref name=\"Kennedy7\"/> These were early demonstrations of how \u201cdiplomatic skills, more than military power, enabled the Banu Munqidh to maintain their precarious independence\u201d, according to Kennedy.<ref name=\"Kennedy7\"/>\n\nThe Banu Munqidh\u2019s pressure on Shayzar compelled its Byzantine rulers to surrender the fortress to Ali in December 1081 in exchange for a certain sum and guarantees of upkeep of the town bishop\u2019s home.<ref name=\"Kennedy7\"/> Shayzar became the center of the Munqidh emirate (principality).<ref name=\"Humphreys578\">Humphreys 1993, p. 578.</ref> The family under Ali soon after faced a siege by the Uqaylids but leveraged their significant wealth to settle with Muslim ibn Quraysh.<ref name=\"Kennedy8\">Kennedy 2012, p. 8.</ref> By the time of Ali's death in 1082, the Banu Munqidh's emirate, now under Ali's son Sadid al-Mulk, extended to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port town of [[Latakia]] and included [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]] and a few smaller places, in addition to Shayzar and Kafartab.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/>\n\n===Reign of Nasr===\nSadid al-Mulk was succeeded by his son Nasr.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> The principal challenge the Banu Munqidh faced during Nasr's reign was the expansion of Seljuk rule into Syria.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> Like their previous encounter with the Uqaylids, the family employed the same strategy to stave off an attack by the Seljuk ruler [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish|Sulayman ibn Qutulmush]] in 1085.<ref name=\"Kennedy8\"/> Moreover, Nasr's conviction that the Seljuks could not be defeated led him to cede his family's territories in Latakia, Apamea and Kafartab to the sultanate in exchange for their firm recognition of the Banu Munqidh's possession of Shayzar in 1086/87.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> Through his good offices with the Seljuk ruler of Aleppo, he was able to return the ceded towns to the Banu Munqidh in 1091.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> However, in 1096 Apamea and Kafartab were lost to the family's Arab rival, Khalaf ibn Mula'ib, the formerly semi-independent lord of [[Homs]].<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/><ref name=\"Cobb11\">Cobb 2005, p. 11.</ref> Ibn Mula'ib was a former subordinate of Nasr who he gradually had to contend with as a frequently hostile neighbor of the Banu Munqidh.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/><ref name=\"Cobb11\"/> In one encounter, Nasr was badly defeated in an ambush by Ibn Mula'ib during an attack outside Shayzar.<ref name=\"Cobb11\"/>\n\n===Reign of Sultan===\n[[File:Siege de Shaizar (1138).jpg|thumb|right|Depiction of [[John II Komnenos|John II]]\u2019s Byzantine-Crusader coalition [[Siege of Shaizar|siege of Shayzar]] in 1138, French manuscript 1338.]]\n\nIn 1098, Nasr ibn Ali died and the lordship of Shayzar passed to his sons. For unknown reasons, Nasr's brother and chosen successor, Murshid,<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> withdrew himself from the line of succession in favor of his younger brother Sultan,<ref>Husain 2011, pp. 193\u2013194.</ref> who had served as the Banu Munqidh's governor in Latakia.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> Murshid maintained a prominent leadership role as his then-childless brother's deputy.<ref name=\"Husain194\">Husain 2011, p. 194.</ref> At the turn of the 11th century, the Banu Munqidh\u2019s possessions were under threat not only by their Turkish suzerains, but also the encroachments of the Banu Kilab, the growing presence of the [[Nizari Ismaili state|Nizari Ismaili]]s in the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range|coastal mountains of northern Syria]] and the newly arrived [[Crusades|Crusaders]].<ref>Kennedy 2012, pp. 8\u20139.</ref> \n\nDuring Sultan\u2019s reign, the Banu Munqidh had become more numerous and Sultan chiefly depended on his own kinsmen in confrontations with the constellation of powers, local and regional, that controlled northern Syria.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> He could also rely on his Kinana tribesmen to an extent and the militiamen of Shayzar.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> To a much lesser extent the family recruited [[Kurds|Kurdish]] mercenaries and Turkish ''[[mamluk]]s'' (slave soldiers).<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> Meanwhile, a tentative alliance was formed with Ibn Mula'ib despite the wounding of Sultan and Murshid in a battle with him in 1104.<ref name=\"Cobb11\"/> Together, the Banu Munqidh and Ibn Mula'ib attacked a small Crusader-held fort in their region in 1106, but Ibn Mula'ib betrayed the Banu Munqidh by deserting and stealing their horses.<ref name=\"Cobb11\"/> Before the family could retaliate, Ibn Mula'ib was killed by an Ismai'il assassin.<ref name=\"Cobb11\"/> At this time, friendly relations were also established with the family's other erstwhile rivals, the Turkish Ibn Qaraja emirs of Hama and Homs.<ref name=\"Cobb12\">Cobb 2005, p. 12.</ref>\n\nThe principal Crusader threat to the Banu Munqidh was posed by the neighboring [[Principality of Antioch]].<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> The prince of Antioch, Tancred, attacked and plundered the Banu Munqidh's emirate in 1110 and imposed a heavy tribute on Shayzar, a testament to its wealth at the time.<ref name=\"Kennedy10\">Kennedy 2012, p. 10.</ref> The following year, Tancred built the Tell Ibn Ma'shar fortress along the west bank of the Orontes, across from Shayzar,<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> to prepare an assault against the city.<ref name=\"Kennedy10\"/> Sultan reached out to [[Mawdud]] of Mosul to prevent this, while Tancred gathered a larger Crusader coalition including the rulers of Jerusalem and Tripoli.<ref name=\"Kennedy10\"/> In the ensuing [[Battle of Shaizar|Battle of Shayzar]], which was according to Kennedy was more of \"a prolonged confrontation\" than a battle, the Crusader armies retreated in October 1111.<ref name=\"Kennedy11\">Kennedy 2012, p. 11.</ref> However, the Banu Munqidh continued paying the annual tribute to Antioch.<ref name=\"Kennedy11\"/>\n\nShayzar also became a target of the Isma'ili sect subsequent to their exodus from Syria's major cities to the coastal mountains.<ref name=\"Kennedy9\">Kennedy 2012, p. 9.</ref> They attempted to seize Shayzar in 1114 while the Banu Munqidh family were away participating in the Easter celebrations of their Orthodox Christian subjects.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/><ref name=\"Kennedy9\"/> The attack was coordinated with the town's Isma'ili residents, who had been generally well-treated by the Banu Munqidh.<ref name=\"Kennedy9\"/> About one hundred Isma'ilis seized the citadel, expelling its residents.<ref name=\"Kennedy9\"/> A bloody struggle ensued upon the Banu Munqidh's return to Shayzar, and involved the participation of the family's women.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> It ended with the slaying of all the Ismai'ili attackers and the enactment of certain measures to prevent a recurrence.<ref name=\"Kennedy9\"/> The following year, a Muslim\u2013Crusader coalition composed of Roger of Antioch, Toghtekin of Damascus and Ilghazi of Mardin besieged Shayzar in response to the plans of the Banu Munqidh's ally Mawdud of Mosul to conquer Syria.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/>\n\n====Suzerainty of the Zengids====\nIn 1127 Sultan put the Banu Munqidh under the suzerainty of the ascendant Muslim ruler of Mosul and Aleppo, [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]], which allowed for a greater level of security for the family's domains.<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/> This was interrupted by a short siege of Shayzar by the Burid ruler of Damascus, Shams al-Mulk Isma'il, in 1133 and a greater crisis by the Byzantine\u2013Crusader [[Siege of Shaizar|siege of Shayzar]] in 1138 led by \n[[John II Komnenos]].<ref name=\"Humphreys578\"/><ref name=\"Kennedy11\"/> The Byzantine-led army initially attacked the Banu Munqidh-held forts of Kafartab and Hisn al-Jisr, causing their inhabitants to flee, before proceeding in their assault against Shayzar.<ref name=\"Kennedy12\">Kennedy 2012, p. 12.</ref> Arabic and Greek sources both indicate that the Banu Munqidh and the people of Shayzar resisted the siege and the Byzantines' catapults for several days before John II's army withdrew.<ref>Kennedy 2012, pp. 15\u201316.</ref> However, the Arabic sources claim the Byzantines left after hearing of the arrival of Zengid reinforcements<ref name=\"Kennedy12\"/> while the Greek sources claim the withdrawal was precipitated by a Zengid attack on Byzantine-held [[Edessa]] and Sultan's offer to pay off John II.<ref>Kennedy 2012, p. 15.</ref>\n\nThe domain of the Banu Munqidh entered a long period of stability and prosperity beginning in 1138.<ref name=\"Kennedy16\">Kennedy 2012, p. 16.</ref> Shayzar and it\u2019s dependencies remained under the control of Sultan who ruled under the authority of the Zengid dynasty.<ref name=\"Kennedy16\"/> However, in 1140/41 the Ismai'ils captured the fortress of [[Masyaf]] from the Banu Munqidh, who had purchased it in 1127/28.<ref name=\"Lewis109\">Lewis, p. 109.</ref> It thereafter became the Isma'ilis' main stronghold in Syria.<ref name=\"Kennedy17\">Kennedy 2012, p. 17.</ref><ref name=\"Lewis109\"/> This generally peaceful period also coincided with tensions between Sultan and his nephews. Murshid's position as the Banu Munqidh's second highest-ranking leader enabled the latter's sons, including [[Usama ibn Munqidh|Usama]], to rise politically within the emirate.<ref name=\"Husain194\"/> They gained a reputation for their martial and diplomatic skills and Sultan viewed their prominence as a threat to his leadership.<ref name=\"Kennedy16\"/> These tensions culminated after Murshid's death in 1136/37 and the birth of Sultan's son Taj al-Mulk Muhammad in the following year.<ref name=\"Kennedy16\"/><ref name=\"Husain194\"/> As a consequence, Usama and his brothers were exiled from Shayzar,<ref name=\"Husain194\"/> finding asylum with [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]], the Zengid emir of Aleppo.<ref name=\"Kennedy16\"/> After Sultan's death in 1154, Taj al-Mulk Muhammad succeeded him without incident.<ref name=\"Kennedy17\"/> \n\n===Demise===\nMost of the Banu Munqidh, including Taj al-Mulk and his children, died in the collapse of the Shayzar citadel during the [[1157 Hama earthquake|August 1157 earthquake]], which devastated a number of other towns in the area.<ref>Kennedy 2012, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> This brought an end to their rule of the Shayzar principality, which was soon after seized by Nur ad-Din to prevent its capture by the Crusaders.<ref name=\"Kennedy20\">Kennedy 2012, p. 20.</ref> Nur ad-Din did not seek to find any surviving members of the Banu Munqidh to resume their lordship of Shayzar, whose fortifications he had promptly restored.<ref name=\"Kennedy20\"/> Instead, he handed the town over to a certain Sabiq al-Din Uthman ibn al-Daya.<ref name=\"Kennedy20\"/> The latter's family, the Banu al-Daya, remained the lords of Shayzar through [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] rule until 1233.<ref>Tonghini and Montevecci 2006, p. 205.</ref>\n\n==Diplomacy and social relations==\n===Relations with the Crusaders===\nThe Banu Munqidh initially reacted to the Crusader invasion of coastal Syria by offering the Crusader king of Jerusalem, [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem|Baldwin I]], a tributary arrangement, provisioning of food supplies and protection for Christian pilgrims passing through the family's territory.<ref name=\"Husain192\">Husain 2011, p. 192.</ref> Though the Kingdom of Jerusalem did not border the Banu Munqidh's domains, the neighboring Frankish principality of Antioch was under Jerusalem's overall authority.<ref name=\"Husain192\"/> This accord with the newly arrived Crusaders in [[Ma'arrat al-Nu'man]] spared Shayzar the latter's devastating raids.<ref name=\"Husain192\"/> Intermittent warfare in the form of raids and clashes partly characterized the contact between the Banu Munqidh and the Crusader states, but they largely maintained practical ties.<ref name=\"Husain193\"/> In 1108, a large annual tribute was imposed by the Crusaders on the Banu Munqidh.<ref name=\"Husain193\"/> \n\nIn addition to the financial sums, they also had to provide guides for the emissaries of the neighboring [[Principality of Antioch]] on their way to [[Jerusalem]].<ref name=\"Husain193\"/> The family was particularly close to King [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem]] (r. 1118\u20131131) and hosted him in Shayzar in 1124 at the request of his Muslim captor and ruler of Aleppo, Timurtash ibn Ilghazi, during negotiations for Baldwin's release.<ref name=\"Husain193\"/><ref name=\"Kohler126\">Kohler, p. 126.</ref> The Munqidhi emirs Sultan and Murshid successfully mediated the ransom for Baldwin's freedom.<ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> Subsequent to his release, Baldwin relieved the Banu Munqidh of their tribute and services in appreciation of their generosity.<ref name=\"Husain193\"/><ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> The bonds forged between the Banu Munqidh and King Baldwin II enabled Usama ibn Munqidh to play a mediating role in the diplomatic negotiations of the early 1130s between Baldwin and [[Taj al-Muluk Buri]], the [[Burid dynasty|Burid]] ruler of [[Damascus]] in whose court Usama served.<ref name=\"Husain193\"/> \n\n===Relations with Muslim states and lordships===\nDespite generally peaceful relations with the Franks, the Banu Munqidh remained loyal to their Muslim suzerains, fighting alongside the Muslim rulers of Aleppo and Damasucs in their battles and campaigns against the Crusaders in 1111, 1115 and 1119.<ref name=\"Kohler125\"/> The family also fended off Crusader attacks against their domains between 1122 and 1124.<ref name=\"Kohler125\"/> The family maintained friendly ties with a number of the semi-independent Muslim lords of other fortress towns who shared their social standing, the Fatimid lord [[Iftikhar al-Dawla]] of [[Abu Qubays, Syria|Abu Qubays]] and the Banu Salim ibn Malik of [[Qal'at Ja'bar]];<ref name=\"Kennedy17\"/><ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> the former's sister was married to Sultan and the emirs of Qal'at Ja'bar shared similar Arab tribal origins as the Banu Munqidh.<ref name=\"Kennedy17\"/><ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> The Banu Munqidh's emirs paid social visits to Iftikhar al-Dawla,<ref name=\"Kennedy17\"/> while keeping frequent contact with Shihab al-Din Salim ibn Malik via letters, couriers and the exchange of gifts.<ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> The emirs of Qal'at Ja'bar played a similar diplomatic role as the Banu Munqidh and both families were described in the Syrian ''Chronicon, A.C. 1234'' as \"a good sort of people, friendly to all and good mediators at any time\".<ref name=\"Kohler126\"/> \n\n===Provision of asylum===\nThe Banu Munqidh often provided asylum for refugees and exiles.<ref name=\"Kohler125\"/> In 1041, they gave temporary refuge in Kafartab to the Fatimid governor of Syria, [[Anushtakin al-Dizbari]], when he was ousted from Damascus and then escorted him safely to the [[Citadel of Aleppo]].<ref name=\"Zakkar85\"/> Later, in the Crusader era, the Banu Munqidh gave refuge to Muslim families fleeing the [[Siege of Ma'arra|siege of Ma'arrat al-Nu'man]] in 1098; the son of their erstwhile rival [[Khalaf ibn Mula'ib]] of Apamea in 1106; the ousted Muslim ruler of [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], ''qadi'' Fakhr al-Mulk ibn Ammar, in 1109; and the [[Nizari Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] ''[[da'i]]'' of Aleppo, Ibrahim, when the [[Order of Assassins|Assassins]] fled Seljuk persecution by [[Alp Arsl\u0101n al-Akhras|Alp Arslan al-Akhras]] in 1113.<ref name=\"Kohler125\"/>\n\n==Recreation==\nBased on the accounts of Usama ibn Munqidh, the family were avid hunters and went on expeditions in the wetlands of Orontes valley west of Shayzar and in the hills south of the city.<ref>Kennedy 2012, pp. 17\u201318.</ref> The expeditions were led by the family's emirs who led retinues containing tens of horsemen, including relatives and ''mamluks''.<ref name=\"Kennedy18\">Kennedy 2012, p. 18</ref> Equipped with various birds of prey, dogs and cheetahs, they hunted [[francolin]], waterfowl, hares, wild boars and partridges.<ref name=\"Kennedy18\"/> However, the ultimate prey of the Munqidhi emirs were lions and leopards, the slaying of which were an apparent symbol and function of the emir's authority.<ref name=\"Kennedy18\"/> According to Kennedy, \"killing lions and leopards\" was \"one of the ways\" an emir \"demonstrated his protection of and care for the people who lived on his lands\".<ref name=\"Kennedy18\"/>\n\n==Assessment==\nThe Banu Munqidh were described as an \"elite, patrician family of well-known warriors who enjoyed a wide reputation for martial valor, honor, piety, and courtly refinement\" by historian Adnan Husain.<ref>Husain 2011, pp. 190\u2013191.</ref> From the citadel of Shayzar, wperched on a rocky hilly enveloped by the Orontes River, the Banu Munqidh ruled a relatively a small emirate largely inhabited by [[Greek Orthodox Christian]]s.<ref name=\"Husain190\">Husain 2011, p. 190.</ref> Throughout their rule, the emirate was surrounded by frequently hostile powers, whether local or regional Muslim lords, Crusader principalities or Bedouin tribes.<ref name=\"Husain191-192\">Husain 2011, pp. 191\u2013192.</ref> In addition to their military abilities, the family often pursued diplomacy and alliances with their larger neighbors.<ref name=\"Husain191-192\"/> Their martial skills and diplomatic maneuvers enabled their survival.<ref name=\"Husain191-192\"/> According to an account of a conversation between an emissary of [[Roger of Salerno|Roger of Antioch]] and Sultan in 1116, the lands of the Banu Munqidh were developed and prosperous, distinguishing them from the ruinous state of the surrounding region.<ref name=\"Kennedy17\"/><ref name=\"Husain193\">Husain 2011, p. 193.</ref><ref name=\"Kohler125\">Kohler, p. 125.</ref> This was an apparent testament to the Banu Munqidh\u2019s wealth.<ref name=\"Kennedy17\"/>\n\n==List of Banu Munqidh emirs==\n{| class=\"nowraplinks\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\"

From advancing the off-grid solar technologies bringing power to energy-impoverished people, to cutting the catastrophic climate impacts of air conditioning, CLASP programs increase uptake of affordable, low-impact, high-quality appliances.\n\nAppliances are a big part of our lives. Smart phones keep us connected. Heating, cooling, and lighting improve productivity and safety. Refrigeration protects the food we harvest and eat.  Without much thought, we interact with energy- and resource-consuming products every day.\n\nThough appliances improve lives and livelihoods, they also use energy and other essential resources. Recent analyses indicate that air conditioning, not cars, pose the greatest threat to our planet. As millions of households in developing and emerging economies have the financial resources to control their indoor climate for the first time, the world is poised to install 700 million new room air conditioners by 2030 and 1.6 billion by 2050.  In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, that's like adding several large countries to the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 3 billion people prepare their meals on inefficient, pre-modern cookstoves, or over open fires, using charcoal and biomass. An estimated 1.2 billion people around the globe lack access to electricity entirely\u2014another billion have only unreliable access. Energy poverty is a major barrier to social and economic development, and the emissions generated by inefficient and dirty cooking and lighting methods pose serious health risks, especially to women and children, and are powerful climate forcers. For most households living beyond the grid, electrification is too long coming, and for most governments, total electrification is far too expensive and resource-intensive.\n\nOn the grid, energy efficient appliances are one of the most cost-effective methods for mitigating climate change.

From advancing the off-grid solar technologies bringing power to energy-impoverished people, to cutting the catastrophic climate impacts of air conditioning, CLASP programs increase uptake of affordable, low-impact, high-quality appliances.\n\nAppliances are a big part of our lives. Smart phones keep us connected. Heating, cooling, and lighting improve productivity and safety. Refrigeration protects the food we harvest and eat.  Without much thought, we interact with energy- and resource-consuming products every day.\n\nThough appliances improve lives and livelihoods, they also use energy and other essential resources. Recent analyses indicate that air conditioning, not cars, pose the greatest threat to our planet. As millions of households in developing and emerging economies have the financial resources to control their indoor climate for the first time, the world is poised to install 700 million new room air conditioners by 2030 and 1.6 billion by 2050.  In terms of greenhouse gas emissions, that\u2019s like adding several large countries to the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 3 billion people prepare their meals on inefficient, pre-modern cookstoves, or over open fires, using charcoal and biomass. An estimated 1.2 billion people around the globe lack access to electricity entirely\u2014another billion have only unreliable access. Energy poverty is a major barrier to social and economic development, and the emissions generated by inefficient and dirty cooking and lighting methods pose serious health risks, especially to women and children, and are powerful climate forcers. For most households living beyond the grid, electrification is too long coming, and for most governments, total electrification is far too expensive and resource-intensive.\n\nOn the grid, energy efficient appliances are one of the most cost-effective methods for mitigating climate change. They save money for governments and consumers alike, reduce peak energy demand, and bolster economic and energy security. Off the grid, energy efficient appliances pair with solar-home systems or mini-grids to increase the availability and affordability of energy. Radically reducing the cost of off-grid energy through efficient appliances improves educational, health, and economic outcomes for the world\u2019s poorest people, while moving all of us closer to a cleaner, renewably-powered energy economy.\n\nCLASP was created in 1999 as a strategic cooperation of three organization \u2013 the [[Alliance to Save Energy|Alliance to Save Energy (ASE)]], the International Institute for Energy Conservation (IIEC), and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL).<ref>{{cite web|title=LBNL|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/l2m2/clasp.html|access-date=2012-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627133251/http://eetd.lbl.gov/l2m2/clasp.html|archive-date=2012-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>  It became an independent, non profit [[501(c)3]] organization in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=UN Division for Sustainable Development|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/sustdev/csd/csd15/PF/info/C_Egan.pdf|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=5 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==What We Do ==\nSince 1999, CLASP has worked in over 100 countries taking three primary approaches:\n\n'''Policy & Analysis''' \u2013 smart policy moves markets towards more energy-efficient and higher quality appliances, from LEDs to cookstoves.
