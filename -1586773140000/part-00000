In 1951, she was converted to diesel-electric power, completely rebuilt and renamed ''North Head''. She was removed from service in 1985 following the introduction of the [[Freshwater-class ferry|Freshwater class ferries]]. She spent time in Hobart as a floating restaurant, and in 2000, she was taken to [[Cairns]] where she remains grounded and in deteriorating condition.\n\nThe name \"Barrenjoey\" was taken from [[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|the headland]] at the northern tip of [[Pittwater]]. \"North Head\" is [[North Head, New South Wales|the northern headland]] at the entrance to [[Sydney Harbour]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kuringgai Flickr.jpg|thumb|left|''Kuring-gai'' (1901) was the forerunner to the \"Bingarra-type\" vessels including ''Barrenjoey''. Note the wheel houses located midships compared to ''Barrenjoey's'' at the ends of the sun deck.]]\n\nThe Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company's fleet transitioned comparatively late to screw propelled vessels and the fleet comprised mostly paddle steamers until the early years of the twentieth century. The difficulty of turning in the narrow bays of Sydney Harbour - particularly in the busy Circular Quay terminus in [[Sydney Cove]] - required the use of double-ended vessels. However, a double-ended screw configuration was particularly difficult for the fine bows that Manly ferries required for both speed and heavy seas. Further, a propeller at the leading forward end of a vessel reduced speed considerably. In the properous early twentieth century, this speed drawback was overcome by increasing enginee size and power. \n\nThe first screw ferries on the Manly run were two innovative [[Walter Reeks]]-designed vessels; the ''[[SS Manly]]'' (1896), and ''[[SS Kuring-gai]]'' (1901), which were to become the fore-runners of the \"Binggarra-class\" ferries. They both had high [[forecastle]]s at either to help her run through the deep-sea conditions across the [[Sydney Heads]]. The steel-hulled ''Kuring-gai'' was larger and she further refined the basic design to be similar to the subsequent and larger \"Binngarra-class\" vessels. ''Manly'' and ''Kuring-gai'' had both, however, followed paddle steamer design with their bridges around the midships funnels. Whereas the \"Binggarra-class\" vessels would have their wheelhouses at either end of their promenade decks. \n\nThe \"Binngarra-class\" ferries, ''[[Binngarra]]'' (1905), ''[[Burra-Bra]]'' (1908), ''[[Bellubera]]'' (1910), ''[[SS Balgowlah|Balgowlah]]'' (1912), ''Barrenjoey'' (1913), and ''[[Baragoola]]'' (1922), were designed by [[Mort's Dock and Engineering]], initially under the guidance of former chief draughtsman Andrew Christie. The first five were built at Mort's [[Woolwich]] yard and ''Baragoola'' was built at the [[Balmain]] yard. They were among the largest ships built in Australian yards at the time and, on the admission of Mort's executives, were built by the dock more for prestige than profit. Build costs were higher in Australia than in the United Kingdom, but this was offset by the cost of sailing them out to Australia. \n\n==Steam ship ''Barrenjoey''==\n[[File:Manly ferry Barrenjoey.jpg|thumb|left|''Barrenjoey'' on Sydney Harbour, 1920s, before expansion of her wheelhouses]]\n\nFollowing ''Bellubera's'' success (she was bigger and faster than the preceding ''Binngarra'' and ''Burra-Bra''), in 1911 the Company placed an order for two new vessels, ''Balgowlah'' and ''Barrenjoey'', which were largely the same design. The three would represent the largest, fastest, and most refined of the six \"Binngarra-class\" vessels. Like the previous four of the class, ''Barrenjoey'' was built by [[Mort's Dock]] at their [[Woolwich, New South Wales|Woolwich]] yard. \n\nThe three vessels all had riveted steel hulls with single screws at either end, and steam steering equipment. ''Barrenjoey'' was 500 tons, 64.0 m in length and had a passenger capacity of 1,512. Her 112 horsepower triple expansion steam engines were also built by Mort's Dock could push her at up to 15 knots. The vessels had \"navy-type\" boilers with corrugated furnaces in both.\n\nThe ships' promenade (upper) decks were entirely open except for two small shelters and the canopy formed by the sun deck. All of the \"Binngarra-class\" would later have their upper decks enclosed except the first two, ''Binngarra'' and ''Burra Bra''. The main (lower) decks were enclosed and had outside perimeter seating. The two decks were connected by two double internal staircases. The ladies' cabin was located at the aft end of the main deck, while the crew spaces were placed on a flat forward of the boiler room. Electric lighting was fitted throughout. \n\n''Barrenjoey'' was launched on 8 May 1913 by the daughter of Mr. B. McBride (a director of the Port Jackson Company). The name \"Barrenjoey\" was taken from [[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|the headland]] at the northern tip of [[Pittwater]]. Her see trials were run on 17 September 1913 from near [[Long Nose Point]] to the Sow and Pigs and back. A newspaper report said that she exceeded the speed stipulated in the contract by one knot. Following the trials, guests of the company were entertained at a luncheon held on board with her moored off [[Cremorne Point]]. The chairman noted that since the paddle steamer ''Narrabeen'' (1886), the combined value of new steamers delivered by Mort's Dock for the company was \u00a3170,000. In 1901, the fleet comprised five steamers with a combined capacity of 4,300 passengers. 12 years later with ''Barrenjoey's'' introduction, there were eight vessels with a combined capacity of 10,500. The new steamer was placed in service on 20 September 1913, at which time the company's capacity was sufficient and ''Baragoola'' wasn't delivered until 1922.<ref name=Prescott/> \n\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY approaches Circular Quay circa 1930.jpg|In her recently enclosed uppper decks, 1931.\n\nThe cost and difficulty of replacing the large steel-hulled Manly ferries saw them upgraded and modified rather than replaced. In line with regulations requiring improved crew accommodation, facilities were progressivelyremoved from the poorly-ventilated spaces below the main deck. In the 1920s, ''Barrenjoey'' along with ''Bellubera'', ''Balgowlah'' and ''Baragoola'' had officers' cabins attached to their wheelhouses.

''Barrenjoey's'' last trip as a steamer was on 12 April 1948, when she was withdrawn from service for a survey, which subsequently failed her boilers. By 30 June 1949, the ferry's original builder, Mort's Dock and Engineering, had fitted new hull plates, altered the hull framing, and provided foundation beds for the new equipment. Post-war shortages of labour and materials prolonged the work and increased costs to \u00a3261,772 which almost bankrupted the company. \n\nFour seven-cylinder [[British Thomson-Houston]] diesel engines were provided which drove two [[English Electric]] electric engines. Her new engines generated 2000 bhp and could push her to 16 knots. Her tall single steam funnel was replaced with two short funnels. Her formerly timber superstructure was completely rebuilt with a fully enclosed steel upper deck, wheelhouses further extended, and bows rebuilt to resemble the [[South Steyne]]'s (1938). With the exception of the outside seating on the main deck, all seating was enclosed and upholstered. The camber on the upper deck was removed, and with the transverse seating being removable, it was possible to hold dances on board while limited catering facilities were provided.<ref name=Prescott>{{cite book |last1=Prescott |first1=AM |title=Sydney Ferry Fleet |date=1984 |publisher=Ronald H Parsons |location=Magill South Australia |isbn=0909418306 |pages=48,59}}</ref> \n\nThe vessel's new gross and net tonnages was 465.66 and 183.78 respectively.  She was permitted to carry 904 on the main deck and 358 persons on the promenade deck with a total seated capacity of 1,005. The rebuild also provided a  raked bow and stern in place of the former straight stems. Following sea trials on the 5 May 1951, she was commissioned on 7 May 1951 having been renamed ''North Head''. The vessel's stability had been affected by the new heavier steel superstructure and larger wheelhouses. Life rafts were moved from the sun deck to the fore and aft ends of the promenade deck and sections of the bulwarks were hinged to allow the wooden rafts to be pushed overboard.\n\n[[File:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD at Circular Quay 9 January 1981.jpg|''North Head'' at [[Circular Quay]] in her [[Urban Transit Authority]] colours, 1981|left|thumb]]\n\nThe last four \"Binngarra-class\" ferries (''Balgowlah'', ''Bellubera'', ''Barrenjoey'' and ''Baragoola'') were all to be modernised and converted to diesel-electric propulsion. However, the company's post-war economic difficulties and the cost of the ''Barrenjoey'''s rebuild and diesel conversion almost bankrupted the company. As such, ''Balgowlah'' was decommissioned and sold to ship breakers in 1953 and the engines acquired for her went to ''Baragoola''. Upgrades to ''Bellubera'' and ''Baragoola'' in future years were much more modest in scope retaining their original hull shape and timber superstructures. ''Bellubera'' was withdrawn from service in 1973.\n\nIn 1964, it was sent to [[Melbourne]] under her own power for the [[Moomba]] Festival for six weeks. It returned to Melbourne in 1965 and 1967.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/><ref name=TMead/> ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola'' were included in the sale of the Manly ferry business to [[Brambles Limited|Brambles]] in April 1972 (''South Steyne'' was not). With Brambles having allowed the ferries condition and service to deteriorate while suggesting that the service would be closed completely, the [[Public Transport Commission]] took over the service in Decemeber 1974 acquiring  ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola''.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/> With the arrive of the first two [[MV Freshwater|''Freshwater'']] class ferries in 1982 and 1983, ''Baragoola'' was retired. In 1984, a third new ferry, ''Narrabeen'' arrived and with the new ferries having settled down, ''North Head'' was withdrawn on 12 December 1985, 72 years after entering service. \n\nOn 26 March 1987, ''North Head'' departed under its own steam for [[Hobart]] for use as a floating restaurant and convention centre. She underwent significant restoration, however, the venture failed. In 2000, it was sold and moved to [[Cairns]] to be used in the same manner. However, after the venture failed, the ship rotted in a Cairns dock until 2005, when it was sold on [[eBay]] to a landscape contractor, who dug a pit and put it in his front yard.\n\n==Incidents==\nOver her 73 years as a Sydney Harbour ferry, ''Barrenjoey'' / ''North Head'' had her fair share of largely minor collisions and other incidents:<ref name=FerriesofSydney/>  \u00a0 \n* Within a year of her commissioning, ''Barrenjoey'' was lost in thick fog and drifted around [[Manly Cove]] for two and half hours before finding the wharf around 1:30 am. \n* ''Barrenjoey'' collided with ''Kareela'' in 1914, ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]]'' in 1927. Collisions with the timber inner harbour ferries usually resulted in significant damage to the timber boats, but insignificant damage to the steel Manly ferries. \n* In January 1940, she collided with ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kubu]]'' as both ferries tried to avoid yachts. Timber ''Kubu's'' upper deck and railings were badly damaged, whereas steel-hulled ''Barrenjoey'' was only scratched. \n* In January 1942, ''Barrenjoey'' went aground on rocks at Smedleys Point near Manly wharf. She was stuck for an hour before freeing herself and continuing on with her normal trip with no damage. \n* During a cyclone that hit Sydney on 16 April 1946, passengers on ''Barrenjoey'' and ''Baragoola'' were injured and both ferries damaged. Later that day in the same storm, ''Barrenjoey'' was torn free of her mooring at the [[Kurraba Point, New South Wales|Kurraba Point]] base and drifted across the harbour towards a group of navy ships, but then jammed crosswise into the [[Neutral Bay ferry wharf]]. A tug was used to pull her free.\n* On the night 28 May 1955, ''North Head'' ran aground off [[Bradleys Head]] in thick fog. It was two and a half hours before she was pulled off, by which time the fog was so thick, all harbour traffic had been halted.\n* In 1976, a fire broke out in ''North Head's'' wiring. It was put out and she returned to the [[Balmain, NEw South Wales|Balmain]] base where it was replaced and she went back into service the next day.\n* In 1979, ''North Head'' failed to stop at Circular Quay and rammed the seawall and footpath. Damage was found to be slight, however, with only ''Baragoola'' and the small ''Lady Wakehurst'' available, peak hour was chaos. \n* In July 1979, she lost a rudder near Bradleys Head which caused chaos on the morning run for the 31st. With only one rudder until a new one could be made, she was used sparingly in peak hour. ''Baragoola'' and the smaller ''Lady Wakehurst'' had to carry the majority of the service as the small ''Lady Nortcott'' was not available due to a refit.\n* On 5 November 1984, during a Sydney record rain event, ''North Head'' and ''[[MV Kanangra|Kanangra]]'' collided off the [[Sydney Opera House]]. ''North Head'' had turned too early and the collision with ''Kanangra'' prevented her running into the [[Sydney Opera House]]. The smaller ''Kanangra'' had significant damage but there was no apparent significant damage to ''North Head''. Two weeks later, however, she broke down and was found to have a broken propellor shaft, likely damaged in the accident with ''Kanangra''.\n\n==Chronological gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY passes Bradley's Head circa 1913-1930.jpg|Rounding [[Bradley's Head]] in her as built form with original wheelhouses and open upper decks. \nFile:Sydney Ferries KIANDRA and BARRENJOEY at Circular Quay.jpg|In Circular Quay behind ferry [[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]], 1920s\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY crossing the Sydney Heads 1930 or early 1940s.jpg|Crossing [[Sydney Heads]] with extended wheelhouses and enclosed upper decks, 1930s or early 1940s.\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD removal of steam engine during conversion to diesel electrica 1948-51.jpg|Removal of steam engines during conversion to diesel-eletric propulsion\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD en route to Manly at the Heads on Sydney Harbour 20 January 1973.jpg|Port Jackson Company colours\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passing Hydrofoil ferry DEE WHY at North Head on Sydney Harbour 13 Jan 1974.jpg|Passing hydrofoil ''Dee Why'' with her namesake [[North Head, New South Wales|North Head]] in the background\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD in Cockatoo Island Dock for maintenance 1975.jpg|In Cockatoo dock for maintenance, 1975\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passes Dobroyd Head on way from Manly to Circular Quay April 1980.jpg|In Public Transport Commission colours passing [[Dobroyd Head]] en route to Circular Quay, 1980\nFile:Sydney_Ferry_NORTH_HEAD_interior_upper_deck_1980.jpg|Interior upper deck, 1980\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD at Circular Quay 9 January 1981.jpg|Urban Transport Authority colours, 1981\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1984.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]] in rough seas, [[Middle Head]] in the background, 1984\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1985.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]], 1985\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD arrives at Circular Quay 1985.jpg|After final refit showing the masts added \nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD grounded in Cairns 2009.jpg|Aground and land-locked at [[Trinity Inlet]] near [[Cairns]], 2009\n</gallery>\n\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Sydney Harbour ferries]]\n\n==External links==\n[http://simonfieldhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Manly-Ferry-SS-Barrenjoey-North-Head-1024x789.jpg Images on SimonFieldhouse.com showing her 1913, 1936 and 1951 configurations]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Australianferries|state=collapsed}}\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:North Head}}\n[[Category:Ferries of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Ferry transport in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Ships built in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1913 ships]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD off Bradley's Head 17 January 1972.jpg\n|Ship image size=300px\n|Ship caption={{nowrap|as ''North Head'' on [[Sydney Harbour]], 1972}}}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship flag={{shipboxflag|Australia|civil}}\n|Ship name=*MV ''North Head''\n*formerly SS ''Barrenjoey''\n|Ship owner=\n|Ship operator=*[[Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company]]\n*[[Public Transport Commission]]\n*[[Urban Transit Authority]]\n|Ship registry=[[Port Jackson|Sydney]]\n|Ship namesake=*[[Sydney Heads|North Head]]\n*[[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|Barrenjoey]]\n|Ship route=[[Manly ferry services|Manly]]\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=[[Mort's Dock]]\n|Ship original cost=\u00a332,000\n|Ship yard number=39\n|Ship way number=\n|Ship laid down=\n|Ship launched=8 May 1913\n|Ship completed=\n|Ship christened=\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship maiden voyage=\n|Ship in service=20 September 1913\n|Ship out of service=12 December 1985\n|Ship identification={{IMO Number|5256939}}\n|Ship fate=\n|Ship status=\n|Ship notes=}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=\n|Ship tonnage=499 tonnes\n|Ship displacement=\n|Ship length=\n|Ship beam=\n|Ship height=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship depth=\n|Ship decks=2\n|Ship deck clearance=\n|Ship ramps=\n|Ship ice class=\n|Ship sail plan=\n|Ship power=\n|Ship propulsion=\n|Ship speed=\n|Ship capacity=1,262\n|Ship crew=\n|Ship notes=}}\n|}\nThe '''MV ''North Head''''' (formerly SS '''''Barrenjoey''''') was a ferry operated by the [[Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company]] and its successors on the [[Manly ferry services|Manly service]] from 1913 until 1985. \n\nThe vessel was launched as ''Barrenjoey'', a steamer and one of the six \"Binngarra\" type Manly ferries which were built between 1905 and 1922.

In the 1940s additional cabins were added to the wheelhouses for the entire crews, which affected the vessels' stability and resulted in reduced passenger capacities from the 1950s.<ref name=Prescott/> Also in the 1920s, ''Barrenjoey'' and the rest of the \"Binngarra-class\" ferries were fitted with small cafeterias below the main deck aft, but the cafeteria's were removed from the vessels in the 1930s.<ref name=Prescott/> \n\nIn August 1930, ''Barrenjoey'' had much of her open upper deck enclosed with reversible and upholstered seating provided making the vessels more suitable for the heavy business traffic, and was of benefit to the travelling public during the colder months and at night.<ref name=FerriesofSydney>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160227124230/http://ferriesofsydney.com/barrenjoey.html SS Barrenjoey/MV North Head] Ferries of Sydney</ref><ref name=HistoryWorks>[http://www.historyworks.com.au/B%20Boats.pdf Manly Ferries Balgowlah, Barrenjoey & Baragoola] History Works December 2007</ref><ref name=TMead>{{cite book|last1=Mead|first1=Tom|title=Manly Ferries of Sydney Harbour|date=1988|publisher=Child & Associates|location=Brookvale|isbn=0 86777 091 0|pages=164\u2013165}}</ref> ''Balgowlah'', ''Bellubera'', and ''Baragoola'' also received enclosed upper decks between 1931 and 1932, however, the older ''Binngarra'' and ''Burra-Bra'' did not receive the upgrade.<ref name=Prescott/> Curl Curl and Dee Why (both 1928) had been built with the enclosed upper saloon.\n\n==Motor vessel ''North Head''==\n[[File:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD leaving Manly Wharf 1954.jpg|Newly rebuilt as ''North Head'', leaving Manly, prior to Queen Elizabeth II first visit to Australia, 1954|thumb]] \n\nIn 1946, the company decided to convert ''Balgowlah'' and ''Barrenjoey'' from steam to diesel-electric propulsion, as the cost of replacing the two vessels with new boats was by then prohibitive to the company. ''Barrenjoey's'' last trip as a steamer was on 12 April 1948, when she was withdrawn from service for a survey, which subsequently failed her boilers. By 30 June 1949, the ferry's original builder, Mort's Dock and Engineering, had fitted new hull plates, altered the hull framing, and provided foundation beds for the new equipment. Post-war shortages of labour and materials prolonged the work and increased costs to \u00a3261,772 which almost bankrupted the company. \n\nFour seven-cylinder [[British Thomson-Houston]] diesel engines were provided which drove two [[English Electric]] electric engines. Her new engines generated 2000 bhp and could push her to 16 knots. Her tall single steam funnel was replaced with two short funnels. Her formerly timber superstructure was completely rebuilt with a fully enclosed steel upper deck, wheelhouses further extended, and bows rebuilt to resemble the [[South Steyne]]'s (1938). With the exception of the outside seating on the main deck, all seating was enclosed and upholstered. The camber on the upper deck was removed, and with the transverse seating being removable, it was possible to hold dances on board while limited catering facilities were provided.<ref name=Prescott>{{cite book |last1=Prescott |first1=AM |title=Sydney Ferry Fleet |date=1984 |publisher=Ronald H Parsons |location=Magill South Australia |isbn=0909418306 |pages=48,59}}</ref> \n\nThe vessel's new gross and net tonnages was 465.66 and 183.78 respectively.  She was permitted to carry 904 on the main deck and 358 persons on the promenade deck with a total seated capacity of 1,005. The rebuild also provided a  raked bow and stern in place of the former straight stems. Following sea trials on the 5 May 1951, she was commissioned on 7 May 1951 having been renamed ''North Head''. The vessel's stability had been affected by the new heavier steel superstructure and larger wheelhouses. Life rafts were moved from the sun deck to the fore and aft ends of the promenade deck and sections of the bulwarks were hinged to allow the wooden rafts to be pushed overboard.\n\n[[File:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD at Circular Quay 9 January 1981.jpg|''North Head'' at [[Circular Quay]] in her [[Urban Transit Authority]] colours, 1981|left|thumb]]\n\nIn 1964, it was sent to [[Melbourne]] under her own power for the [[Moomba]] Festival for six weeks. It returned to Melbourne in 1965 and 1967.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/><ref name=TMead/> ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola'' were included in the sale of the Manly ferry business to [[Brambles Limited|Brambles]] in April 1972 (''South Steyne'' was not). With Brambles having allowed the ferries condition and service to deteriorate while suggesting that the service would be closed completely, the [[Public Transport Commission]] took over the service in Decemeber 1974 acquiring  ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola''.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/> With the arrive of the first two [[MV Freshwater|''Freshwater'']] class ferries in 1982 and 1983, ''Baragoola'' was retired. In 1984, a third new ferry, ''Narrabeen'' arrived and with the new ferries having settled down, ''North Head'' was withdrawn on 12 December 1985, 72 years after entering service. \n\nOn 26 March 1987, ''North Head'' departed under its own steam for [[Hobart]] for use as a floating restaurant and convention centre. She underwent significant restoration, however, the venture failed. In 2000, it was sold and moved to [[Cairns]] to be used in the same manner. However, after the venture failed, the ship rotted in a Cairns dock until 2005, when it was sold on [[eBay]] to a landscape contractor, who dug a pit and put it in his front yard.\n\n==Incidents==\nOver her 73 years as a Sydney Harbour ferry, ''Barrenjoey'' / ''North Head'' had her fair share of largely minor collisions and other incidents:<ref name=FerriesofSydney/>  \u00a0 \n* Within a year of her commissioning, ''Barrenjoey'' was lost in thick fog and drifted around [[Manly Cove]] for two and half hours before finding the wharf around 1:30 am. \n* ''Barrenjoey'' collided with ''Kareela'' in 1914, ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]]'' in 1927. Collisions with the timber inner harbour ferries usually resulted in significant damage to the timber boats, but insignificant damage to the steel Manly ferries. \n* In January 1940, she collided with ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kubu]]'' as both ferries tried to avoid yachts. Timber ''Kubu's'' upper deck and railings were badly damaged, whereas steel-hulled ''Barrenjoey'' was only scratched. \n* In January 1942, ''Barrenjoey'' went aground on rocks at Smedleys Point near Manly wharf. She was stuck for an hour before freeing herself and continuing on with her normal trip with no damage. \n* During a cyclone that hit Sydney on 16 April 1946, passengers on ''Barrenjoey'' and ''Baragoola'' were injured and both ferries damaged. Later that day in the same storm, ''Barrenjoey'' was torn free of her mooring at the [[Kurraba Point, New South Wales|Kurraba Point]] base and drifted across the harbour towards a group of navy ships, but then jammed crosswise into the [[Neutral Bay ferry wharf]]. A tug was used to pull her free.\n* On the night 28 May 1955, ''North Head'' ran aground off [[Bradleys Head]] in thick fog. It was two and a half hours before she was pulled off, by which time the fog was so thick, all harbour traffic had been halted.\n* In 1976, a fire broke out in ''North Head's'' wiring. It was put out and she returned to the [[Balmain, NEw South Wales|Balmain]] base where it was replaced and she went back into service the next day.\n* In 1979, ''North Head'' failed to stop at Circular Quay and rammed the seawall and footpath. Damage was found to be slight, however, with only ''Baragoola'' and the small ''Lady Wakehurst'' available, peak hour was chaos. \n* In July 1979, she lost a rudder near Bradleys Head which caused chaos on the morning run for the 31st. With only one rudder until a new one could be made, she was used sparingly in peak hour. ''Baragoola'' and the smaller ''Lady Wakehurst'' had to carry the majority of the service as the small ''Lady Nortcott'' was not available due to a refit.\n* On 5 November 1984, during a Sydney record rain event, ''North Head'' and ''[[MV Kanangra|Kanangra]]'' collided off the [[Sydney Opera House]]. ''North Head'' had turned too early and the collision with ''Kanangra'' prevented her running into the [[Sydney Opera House]]. The smaller ''Kanangra'' had significant damage but there was no apparent significant damage to ''North Head''. Two weeks later, however, she broke down and was found to have a broken propellor shaft, likely damaged in the accident with ''Kanangra''.\n\n==Chronological gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY passes Bradley's Head circa 1913-1930.jpg|Rounding [[Bradley's Head]] in her as built form with original wheelhouses and open upper decks. \nFile:Sydney Ferries KIANDRA and BARRENJOEY at Circular Quay.jpg|In Circular Quay behind ferry [[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]], 1920s\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY crossing the Sydney Heads 1930 or early 1940s.jpg|Crossing [[Sydney Heads]] with extended wheelhouses and enclosed upper decks, 1930s or early 1940s.\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD removal of steam engine during conversion to diesel electrica 1948-51.jpg|Removal of steam engines during conversion to diesel-eletric propulsion\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD en route to Manly at the Heads on Sydney Harbour 20 January 1973.jpg|Port Jackson Company colours\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passing Hydrofoil ferry DEE WHY at North Head on Sydney Harbour 13 Jan 1974.jpg|Passing hydrofoil ''Dee Why'' with her namesake [[North Head, New South Wales|North Head]] in the background\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD in Cockatoo Island Dock for maintenance 1975.jpg|In Cockatoo dock for maintenance, 1975\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passes Dobroyd Head on way from Manly to Circular Quay April 1980.jpg|In Public Transport Commission colours passing [[Dobroyd Head]] en route to Circular Quay, 1980\nFile:Sydney_Ferry_NORTH_HEAD_interior_upper_deck_1980.jpg|Interior upper deck, 1980\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD at Circular Quay 9 January 1981.jpg|Urban Transport Authority colours, 1981\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1984.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]] in rough seas, [[Middle Head]] in the background, 1984\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1985.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]], 1985\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD arrives at Circular Quay 1985.jpg|After final refit showing the masts added \nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD grounded in Cairns 2009.jpg|Aground and land-locked at [[Trinity Inlet]] near [[Cairns]], 2009\n</gallery>\n\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Sydney Harbour ferries]]\n\n==External links==\n[http://simonfieldhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Manly-Ferry-SS-Barrenjoey-North-Head-1024x789.jpg Images on SimonFieldhouse.com showing her 1913, 1936 and 1951 configurations]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Australianferries|state=collapsed}}\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:North Head}}\n[[Category:Ferries of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Ferry transport in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Ships built in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1913 ships]]\n", "name_user": "Merbabu", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMotor vessel North Head:oops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_North_Head"}
