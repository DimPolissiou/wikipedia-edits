Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/scholar/james-a-naismith|title=James Naismith|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> The game became established fairly quickly and  grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges, the professional game followed. The American [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture.\n\n==Early history==\n===Invention of the game===\nThe game of [[basketball]] as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. Naismith was a physical education instructor at YMCA International Training School (now known as [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]]) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss, Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold weather.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/scholar/james-a-naismith|title=James Naismith|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed.\nThe first public basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892.<ref name=Republican>{{cite news | title = Basket Football Game | newspaper = Springfield Republican | location = [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] | date = March 12, 2002 | url = http://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/206238 | accessdate = June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Naismith's original rules===\n[[File:Dr. James Naismith's Original 13 Rules of Basket Ball pg 1.jpg|thumb|300px|An illustration of a basketball game that accompanied Nasmith's article from ''The Triangle'' in 1892 listing his 13 rules.]]\nThere were only thirteen rules of \"basket ball\":\n# The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.\n# The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands.\n# A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at good speed.\n# The ball must be held in or between the hands, the arms or body must not be used for holding it.\n# No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute.\n# A foul is striking the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.\n# If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count a goal for opponents.\n# A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the basket and stays there. If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal.\n# When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The \"thrower-in\" is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them.\n# The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made.\n# The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.\n# The time shall be fifteen-minute halves, with five-minute rests between.\n# The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In the case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.<ref>Wolff, Alexander.

National recognition and earnings were low, leading the league to look for a way out of its problems.  Merger with the more established and very successful NBA was seen as a solution.

He left the Cavaliers in 2010 to join the Miami Heat along with fellow stars [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Chris Bosh]] in what become known as the controversial decision,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrdw.com/sports/headlines/98082929.html|title=LeBron: \"I'm taking my talents to South Beach\"|first=Jake|last=Young|publisher=}}</ref> winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013 before returning to the Cavaliers in 2014 where he won a third championship in 2016.

The most noticeable would be [[Yao Ming]]. He was the first ever Chinese player to be selected with the number one overall pick in 2002 by the [[Houston Rockets]]. His play and presence in the NBA brought attention to basketball in Asian countries.\n\nThe style of basketball has evolved over time as well. Basketball, especially in the 1990s and 2000s, used to give importance to big men. Games were slow-paced and very defense-oriented. Now because of teams like the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and the [[Golden State Warriors]], ball movement and team play is more common. The game has slowly moved away from this type of play. The game now is up-tempo and teams are starting to involve a lot more three point shooting in their offenses. [[Stephen Curry]] of the Golden State Warriors has been a trendsetter with his shooting abilities. In a way he has popularized and re-energized the notion of shooting among the youth.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Women's basketball]]\n* [[Timeline of women's basketball history]]\n* [[Basketball rules]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last1 = Arceri | first1 = Mario |last2=Bianchini |first2=Valerio | title = La leggenda del basket | publisher = Baldini Castoldi Dalai | location = Milano | year = 2004 | isbn = 9788884906267 }}\n* {{cite book |first=Robert W. |last=Peterson |title=Cages to Jump Shots: Pro Basketball's Early Years |location=Lincoln |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-8032-8772-0 }}\n* James Naismith, ''Basketball: Its Origin and Development'', University of Nebraska Press, 1941.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://sports.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=706&lotIdNo=6215 Transcript of Naismith's original notes on the first basketball game]\n* [https://www.usab.com/history/dr-james-naismiths-original-13-rules-of-basketball.aspx  Dr. James Naismith's Original 13 Rules of Basketball]\n* [http://historyscoper.com/basketballscope.html The Historyscoper]\n\n{{basketball}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basketball}}\n[[Category:History of basketball|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Account of the history and development of the sport of basketball}}\n{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Multiple issues|{{Original research|date=March 2019}}{{sources|date=March 2019}}{{Missing information|several sections need expansion, NBA history incomplete, history of basketball outside of North America should be incorporated|date=March 2019}}}}\n[[File:Dr. James Naismith.jpg|thumb|[[James Naismith]] invented basketball in 1891 at the [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|International YMCA Training School]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]].]]\nThe '''history of basketball''' began with its invention in 1891 in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] by Canadian physical education instructor [[James Naismith]] as a less injury-prone sport than football. Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/scholar/james-a-naismith|title=James Naismith|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> The game became established fairly quickly and  grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges, the professional game followed. The American [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture.\n\n==Early history==\n===Invention of the game===\nThe game of [[basketball]] as it is known today was created by Dr. James Naismith in December 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, to condition young athletes during cold months. Naismith was a physical education instructor at YMCA International Training School (now known as [[Springfield College (Massachusetts)|Springfield College]]) in Springfield, Massachusetts. Upon the request of his boss, Naismith was tasked to create an indoor sports game to help athletes keep in shape in cold weather.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/scholar/james-a-naismith|title=James Naismith|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2019-11-04}}</ref> It consisted of peach baskets and a soccer style ball. He published 13 rules for the new game. He divided his class of eighteen into two teams of nine players each and set about to teach them the basics of his new game. The objective of the game was to throw the basketball into the fruit baskets nailed to the lower railing of the gym balcony. Every time a point was scored, the game was halted so the janitor could bring out a ladder and retrieve the ball. After a while, the bottoms of the fruit baskets were removed.\nThe first public basketball game was played in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 11, 1892.<ref name=Republican>{{cite news | title = Basket Football Game | newspaper = Springfield Republican | location = [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] | date = March 12, 2002 | url = http://www.rarenewspapers.com/view/206238 | accessdate = June 9, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Naismith's original rules===\n[[File:Dr. James Naismith's Original 13 Rules of Basket Ball pg 1.jpg|thumb|300px|An illustration of a basketball game that accompanied Nasmith's article from ''The Triangle'' in 1892 listing his 13 rules.]]\nThere were only thirteen rules of \"basket ball\":\n# The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.\n# The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands.\n# A player cannot run with the ball, the player must throw it from the spot on which he catches it, allowance to be made for a man who catches the ball when running at good speed.\n# The ball must be held in or between the hands, the arms or body must not be used for holding it.\n# No shouldering, holding, pushing, tripping or striking in any way the person of an opponent shall be allowed. The first infringement of this rule by any person shall count as a foul, the second shall disqualify him until the next goal is made, or if there was evident intent to injure the person, for the whole of the game, no substitute.\n# A foul is striking the ball with the fist, violation of rules 3 and 4, and such as described in rule 5.\n# If either side makes three consecutive fouls it shall count a goal for opponents.\n# A goal shall be made when the ball is thrown or batted from grounds into the basket and stays there. If the ball rests on the edge and the opponent moves the basket it shall count as a goal.\n# When the ball goes out of bounds it shall be thrown into the field and played by the person first touching it. In case of a dispute, the umpire shall throw it straight into the field. The \"thrower-in\" is allowed five seconds. If he holds it longer it shall go to the opponent. If any side persists in delaying the game, the umpire shall call a foul on them.\n# The umpire shall be the judge of the men and shall note the fouls, and notify the referee when three consecutive fouls have been made.\n# The referee shall be the judge of the ball and shall decide when the ball is in play, in-bounds, and to which side it belongs, and shall keep the time. He shall decide when a goal has been made and keep account of the goals with any other duties that are usually performed by a referee.\n# The time shall be fifteen-minute halves, with five-minute rests between.\n# The side making the most goals in that time shall be declared the winner. In the case of a draw, the game may, by agreement of the captains, be continued until another goal is made.<ref>Wolff, Alexander.

The Original Celtics are sometimes incorrectly thought of as forebears of the current [[Boston Celtics]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]; in reality, they share only a name, as today's Celtics were not founded until 1946, nearly two decades after the demise of the Original Celtics.

National recognition and earnings were low, leading the league to look for a way out of its problems.  Merger with the more established and very successful NBA was seen as a solution.

He was taken as the first overall pick in the [[2003 NBA Draft]] by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and has worked his way to become the face of the NBA and basketball around the world. He left the Cavaliers in 2010 to join the Miami Heat along with fellow stars [[Dwyane Wade]] and [[Chris Bosh]] in what become known as the controversial decision,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrdw.com/sports/headlines/98082929.html|title=LeBron: \"I'm taking my talents to South Beach\"|first=Jake|last=Young|publisher=}}</ref> winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013 before returning to the Cavaliers in 2014 where he won a third championship in 2016. He joined the Los Angeles Lakers on July 1, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=I'm coming home|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2014/07/11/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers}}</ref>\n\nThere have been many international players who helped globalize the game. The most noticeable would be [[Yao Ming]]. He was the first ever Chinese player to be selected with the number one overall pick in 2002 by the [[Houston Rockets]]. His play and presence in the NBA brought attention to basketball in Asian countries.\n\nThe style of basketball has evolved over time as well. Basketball, especially in the 90's and 2000's, used to give importance to big men. Games were slow-paced and very defense-oriented. Now because of teams like the [[San Antonio Spurs]] and the [[Golden State Warriors]], ball movement and team play is more common. The game has slowly moved away from this type of play. The game now is up-tempo and teams are starting to involve a lot more three point shooting in their offenses. [[Stephen Curry]] of the Golden State Warriors has been a trendsetter with his shooting abilities. In a way he has popularized and re-energized the notion of shooting among the youth.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Women's basketball]]\n* [[Timeline of women's basketball history]]\n* [[Basketball rules]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book | last1 = Arceri | first1 = Mario |last2=Bianchini |first2=Valerio | title = La leggenda del basket | publisher = Baldini Castoldi Dalai | location = Milano | year = 2004 | isbn = 9788884906267 }}\n* {{cite book |first=Robert W. |last=Peterson |title=Cages to Jump Shots: Pro Basketball's Early Years |location=Lincoln |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-8032-8772-0 }}\n* James Naismith, ''Basketball: Its Origin and Development'', University of Nebraska Press, 1941.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://sports.ha.com/c/item.zx?saleNo=706&lotIdNo=6215 Transcript of Naismith's original notes on the first basketball game]\n* [https://www.usab.com/history/dr-james-naismiths-original-13-rules-of-basketball.aspx  Dr. James Naismith's Original 13 Rules of Basketball]\n* [http://historyscoper.com/basketballscope.html The Historyscoper]\n\n{{basketball}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basketball}}\n[[Category:History of basketball|*]]\n", "name_user": "Alistair1978", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo/fmt (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_basketball"}
