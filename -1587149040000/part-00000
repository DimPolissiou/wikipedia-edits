GM's smallest full-size SUV, it is part of the [[Chevrolet C/K]] truck family. Introduced to the [[Chevrolet]] line for the 1969 [[model year]], the K5 Blazer was replaced for 1995 by the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]. In 1970, [[GMC Truck|GMC]] introduced its own model of the truck, called the '''Jimmy''', which was discontinued in 1991 and replaced by the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Yukon]]. The \"Jimmy\" name was chosen to reflect how '''GM''' may sound in a similar manner to how ''[[Jeep]]'' was thought to be a pronunciation of GP in the competing market.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Both were short-[[wheelbase]] trucks and available with either rear- or [[four-wheel drive]].\n\nThe K5 Blazer and Jimmy had \"full convertible\" removable tops until 1975. For 1976, GM introduced a half-cab design that was less prone to leaks and slightly safer in a roll-over. These half cabs had the convertible top begin a few inches behind the driver/passenger doors and run back to the tailgate.\n\nThe Blazer's long-wheelbase relative, with an integrated rear body and doors for 2nd row passengers, is the [[Chevrolet Suburban]].  \n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==1969\u20131972==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=First generation\n|image=1972 K5 Blazer.jpg\n|model_years=1969\u20131972\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#292|{{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] I6<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]] <br> [[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8\n|aka=GMC Jimmy\n|wheelbase= {{Convert|104|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1969\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1969_Trucks_and_Vans/1969_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure/1969%20Chevrolet%20Blazer-06.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1969_Trucks_and_Vans/1969_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n|transmission=3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH-350]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]] <br> 3-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>4-speed manual\n|length= {{Convert|177.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1969\"/><br>180\"(1971)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure/1971%20Chevy%20Blazer-08.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n|width= {{Convert|79|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1969\"/>\n}}\n[[File:'70 GMC Jimmy (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '11).jpg|thumb|left|1970 GMC Jimmy]]\nThe original K5 was a short wheelbase [[truck]]. It was available in 1969 model year as four-wheel drive only; for 1970, a two-wheel drive model was offered. There were four choices for power plants: the ''[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#250|250]]'' [[straight-6]], the ''[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#292|292]]'' [[straight-6]], the ''[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#307|307]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]], and the ''[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#350|350]]'' V8.\n\nThe Blazer was designed and marketed to compete with [[International Harvester Scout]] and the [[Ford Bronco]]. Both of these were originally aimed at the short [[Jeep CJ]] series, which were much smaller than other trucks. The innovation of the Blazer was to simply offer a shortened pickup truck, which both increased interior space, and lowered the cost of production with a shared platform. The Blazer quickly became popular. For the first time, it married the off-road capabilities of the Scout with the \"luxury\" features like air conditioning and automatic transmissions routinely available on pickup trucks. By 1970, the Blazer was already outselling both of its older rivals. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Dodge]], and even Jeep would counter with similar shortened pickups, with the [[Dodge Ramcharger]] and [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Jeep Cherokee]]. It also came as a convertible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1969_Trucks_and_Vans/1969_Chevrolet_Blazer_Convertible_Top/1969%20Chevy%20Blazer%20Convertible%20Top-01.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1969_Trucks_and_Vans/1969_Chevrolet_Blazer_Convertible_Top |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n\nThe two-wheel drive version came with independent front suspension and rear trailing arms, both with coil springs. The four-wheel drive version had a solid front axle and used [[leaf spring]]s front and rear. Both versions used drum brakes at all four corners until 1971, when the entire GM light truck line got standard front discs. A tachometer was optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure/1971%20Chevy%20Blazer-06.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a choice between a three-speed [[automatic transmission]] Turbo Hydromatic (TH350), a three-speed [[manual transmission]], and a four-speed Synchromesh (SM465) manual transmission, often referred to as the \"granny gear\" due to its 6.55:1 low first gear. Two transfer cases were offered: the [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 20, available only with the manual transmissions, or the [[NP-205]], available with both types of transmissions. The Blazer had {{Convert|8|in|mm}} of ground clearance and an approach angle of 35\u00b0.<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1969\"/>\n\nIn October 2019, a customized version of the first generation K5 Blazer was made using the entire body of a 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe was circulated throughout the social media world ahead of a scheduled display at the 2019 SEMA Show, and in honor of Blazer\u2019s 50th anniversary.<ref>[https://www.thedrive.com/news/30480/this-chevrolet-tahoe-and-k5-blazer-retro-mashup-will-make-your-brain-hurt \u201c2018 Chevrolet Tahoe and K5 Blazer Retro Mashup Will Make Your Brain Hurt\u201d] from The Drive (October 17, 2019)</ref>\n\n'''Engines''':\n*[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#250|250 in\u00b3]] (4.1 L) [[Straight-six engine|I6]] (1969\u20131984)\n*[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#292|292 in\u00b3]] (4.8 L) I6 (1970\u20131971)\n*[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#307|307 in\u00b3]] (5.0 L) [[V8 engine|V8]] (1969\u20131973)\n*[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#350|350 in\u00b3]] (5.7 L) V8 (1969\u20131991)\n\n'''Transfer cases''':\n*NP-205 - gear driven part-time four wheel drive\n*Dana 20 - gear driven part-time four-wheel drive\n\n'''Production Totals''':{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible autocollapse\"\n!Year\n!Production\n|-\n|1969\n|4,935\n|-\n|1970\n|11,527\n|-\n|1971\n|17,220\n|-\n|1972\n|44,266\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n==1973\u20131991==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Second generation\n|image=Chevrolet K5 Blazer -- 09-07-2009.jpg\n|model_years=1973\u20131991\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#292|{{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] I6<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#305|{{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]] <br> [[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8<br>[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8 <br> [[Chevrolet small-block engine#400|{{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8<br>[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2L|6.2 L Detroit Diesel]] V8\n|wheelbase={{convert|106.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length={{convert|184.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure/1973%20Chevrolet%20Blazer-08.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n|aka=GMC Jimmy\n|width={{convert|79.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height={{convert|77.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|transmission=4-speed [[Muncie SM465 transmission|SM465]] [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH-350]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic|TH-400]] automatic<br>4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 / 4L60 / 4L60E / 4L65E|700-R4]] automatic\n}}\n[[File:Chevrolet K5 Blazer .jpg|right|thumb|1989\u20131991 K5 Blazer (Scottsdale trim)]]\n[[File:Chevrolet K5 Blazer.jpg|right|thumb|1981\u20131982 K5 Blazer]]\n[[File:M1009cucv.jpg|right|thumb|Military M1009 CUCV K5 Blazer]]\n[[File:K5 with Snowplow.jpg|right|thumb|1985\u20131988 K5 Blazer equipped for snow plowing]]\n[[File:Chevrolet_Blazer_1500_Silverado_6,2_Diesel.jpg|thumb|1990 Blazer 1500 Silverado 6.2 Diesel]]\n\nFor 1973, GM's line of full-size trucks was redesigned and updated.

In 1976, a half-cab design was introduced and used until 1991.<ref name='specs-76'>{{cite web|url=http://coloradok5.com/specs.shtml#1976|title=Chevy Blazer specifications|work=ColoradoK5.com|publisher=Performance Media Group, Inc|accessdate= 2009-10-05}}</ref><ref name=76p4>{{citation|title=Blazer '76 catalog|date=September 1975|page=4|publisher=Chevrolet Motor Division|url=http://www.coloradok5.com/brochures/1976/blazer4.jpg|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708175554/http://coloradok5.com/brochures/1976/blazer4.jpg|archivedate=2011-07-08}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[GM GMT platform#GMT 400|GMT400 platform]] was introduced in the spring of 1987 as a 1988 model, the K5 Blazer, Suburban, and crew-cab trucks retained the earlier platform until 1991. For in late 1988 for 1989 models, the front grille was changed to resemble the squared-off ones used on the GMT400 series of pickups.\n\nThe K5 Blazer was fitted with a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} inline-six as standard through 1984. Available engines included a {{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} inline-six, small-block V8s of 305, 307, 350, or 400 cubic inches (5.0, 5.0, 5.7, and 6.6 liters), and a 6.2&nbsp;L Detroit Diesel V8.\n\n1973\u20131980 Blazers used the gear-driven part-time NP-205 transfer case (mostly mated to the SM465 manual transmission and some TH350s) or the chain-driven full-time NP-203 transfer case (mated to the TH350 automatic) and DANA-44 front/12-bolt rear axle combination through 1980. Starting in 1981 used the chain-driven NP208 transfer case (NP241 after 1988) with front 10-bolt/rear 10-bolt axle combinations until 1991. There is an overlap of 12-bolt rears into the early '80s, while the 10-bolt front axle was phased into production in the late 1970s.\n\nThe second generation K5 models incorporated the rear hatch glass and tailgate into a single unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the tailgate by use of a manual crank mounted on the tailgate or an electric motor activated by a key-operated switch on the tailgate and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual crank gears wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the electric motor drive cable which goes to the window regulator to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer tailgate was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the tailgate was unlatched.\n\nSince 1981 (in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Arab Oil Embargo]] and the [[1979 energy crisis]]), Chevrolet and GMC used the smaller displacement 305s with a 9.2:1 compression ratio. These engines produced nearly as much torque as the 350, giving a similar driving feel. However, these power plants were underpowered and prone to [[detonation]] ([[engine knocking]]), especially with the electronic spark control module. To achieve the 9.2:1 compression ratio, the cylinder head chambers were smaller, measuring 56&nbsp;cc instead of 76&nbsp;cc.\n\nAround 1976, a prototype K5 Blazer <ref>July 1976 FourWheeler magazine</ref> was used as a testbed for a military [[CUCV]] vehicle built by Vic Hickey, father of the HUMVEE. Between 1983 and 1987, what is known as the M1009 [[CUCV]] was the production militarized version of the civilian K5. The differences are the lack of an air conditioner, an additional leaf spring in the suspension, a hybrid 12/24&nbsp;V electrical system (described in detail below), blackout headlights, front mounted brush guard, a rifle rack, and special paint jobs. A majority of them are painted [[olive drab]] green or in the [[M81 Woodland|woodland]] camouflage pattern, though some vehicles that saw desert use were painted tan. All M1009s, including its derivatives, are powered with the 6.2 L Diesel power plant.\n\nThe M1009s have a split 24/12&nbsp;V electrical system. Most of the truck actually runs on 12&nbsp;V. It has two separate 12&nbsp;V alternators and batteries wired in series, only the glow plug system, injection pump, the starter, and the jumper cable jack are wired to the 24&nbsp;V terminals. everything else in the truck runs on 12&nbsp;V. The glow plugs are actually 12&nbsp;V glow plugs with a resistor pack on the firewall to drop the 24&nbsp;V down to 12&nbsp;V. This resistor pack can be bypassed and the glow plugs run directly off of the 12&nbsp;V battery. If this is done and the 24&nbsp;V starter is replaced with a standard 12v starter, the second alternator is no longer needed. (If this is done then the military 24&nbsp;V slave adapter in the grille will need to be disconnected as well.)\n\nSome decommissioned M1009s end up in law enforcement use (e.g. with the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]) or sold through government auctions, but a handful are still in use by the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]].\n\nAfter 1987, when [[Fuel injection#Throttle body injection|throttle-body injection]] was introduced in the truck engines, the 350 was made the standard power plant.\n\n[[General Motors|GM]] temporarily changed the usual \"[[Chevrolet C/K|C/K]]\" designation to \"R\" and \"V\" for the 1987 through 1991 model years. This was done to avoid confusion with the GMT400-based Chevrolet C/K pickup trucks, which were introduced in 1988, during the overlap period.\n\nIn 1988, four new colors were introduced: Bright Blue Metallic, Forest Green Metallic, Light Mesa Brown Metallic, and Dark Mesa Brown Metallic. More new features for 1988 included a fixed mast antenna in place of the old windshield antenna, a trip odometer as part of the gauge package cluster, and an improved pulse windshield wiper control. Also, helping to reduce air leaks in the doors was a new door handle seal.\n\nThe 1989 Blazer had new base and up-level grilles, as well as new headlight bezels, body side moldings, and front bumper rub strips. Corporate 10-bolt axles were upgraded to 30 spline axle shafts from previous 28 spline. New for 1989 was the introduction of an all-new base coat/clear coat paint. The standard L05 5.7-liter V-8 now had one serpentine accessory drive belt in place of the older multi-belt accessory drive setup. 1989 was first year for the  241 transfer case and also the only year for speedometer cable driven version of the 241. \n\nFor the 1990 model year, all Blazers now had a standard rear wheel anti-lock braking system. A new electronic speedometer system, with a 6 digit odometer on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990, along with non-asbestos brake linings. A new brake warning light on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990. The Blazer body also used double sided, galvanized exterior sheet metal. A new option for 1990 was power mirrors. The 5.7 liter V8 (L05) engine was improved for 1990 with the addition of improved oil control rings, a redesigned rear crankshaft seal, a new camshaft sprocket design, non-asbestos intake manifold gaskets, and heavy-duty intake valves. 3 point shoulder harness also become standard for rear passengers. The rear seat arm rest were eliminated from rear seat to make room for shoulder belts and pads were added to the wheel housings. \n\nFor 1991, the 700R4 was renamed to the 4L60. The TBI (throttle body injection) system used on the Blazer's standard 5.7 liter V8 had longer throttle shaft bearings, new throttle return springs, and improved fuel mixture distribution.  The 5.7 liter V8 also had new heavy-duty intake valves and powdered metal camshaft sprockets. Standard on all engines was a lighter more powerful 100-amp CS130 alternator. Two new exterior colors, Brilliant Blue and Slate Metallic were offered.\n\n'''Engines''':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Engine\n!Years\n!Power\n!Torque\n!Notes\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n|1973\u20131978\n|{{convert|105|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|185|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|\n|-\n|1979\u20131984\n|{{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|210|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#292|{{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] I6\n|1973\u20141974\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=4|[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#305|{{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]]\n|rowspan=2|1981\u20131986\n|{{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|235|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|Federal emissions\n|-\n|{{convert|155|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|240|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|California emissions\n|-\n|1981\n|{{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|240|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|2-barrel carburetor\n|-\n|1987\n|{{convert|170|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|Throttle-body injection\n|-\n|[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8\n|1973\n|{{convert|130|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|220|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|Federal emissions\n|-\n|rowspan=3|[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8\n|1973\u20131986\n|{{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|275|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|\n|-\n|1981\u20131986\n|{{convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|\n|-\n|1987\u20141991\n|{{convert|210|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|300|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|Throttle-body injection\n|-\n|[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#400|{{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8\n|1975\u20131980\n|{{convert|185|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} \n|{{convert|300|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|\n|-\n|[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2L|{{convert|379|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} Detroit Diesel]] V8\n|1982\u20131991\n|{{convert|135|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}\n|{{convert|240|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|\n|}\n(All power and torque figures are pulled from GM factory service manual){{full citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n'''Transfer Cases''':\n*Dana 20 - gear driven part-time four wheel drive (1973)\n*NP-203 - chain driven full-time four wheel drive (1973\u20131979)\n*NP-205 - gear driven part-time four wheel drive (1973\u20131980)\n*NP-208 - chain driven part-time four wheel drive (1981\u20131988)\n*NP-241 - chain driven part-time four wheel drive (1989\u20131991)\n**(NP-208 & NP-241 are \"''shift-on-the-fly''\")\n\n'''Axles''':\n*[[Dana 44]] - Front axle (1973\u20131977/78)\n*GM Corporate 10 Bolt - Front axle (1977/78\u20131991)\n*GM Corporate 12 Bolt - Rear axle (1973\u20131981)\n*GM Corporate 10 Bolt - Rear axle (1982\u20131991)\n\n'''Production Totals''':{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible autocollapse\"\n!Year\n!Production\n|-\n|1973\n|44,841\n|-\n|1974\n|56,798\n|-\n|1975'\n|50,548\n|-\n|1976\n|74,389\n|-\n|1977\n|86,838\n|-\n|1978\n|88,858\n|-\n|1979\n|90,987\n|-\n|1980\n|31,776\n|-\n|1981\n|23,635\n|-\n|1982\n|24,514\n|-\n|1983\n|26,245\n|-\n|1984\n|39,329\n|-\n|1985\n|40,011\n|-\n|1986\n|37,310\n|-\n|1987\n|32,437\n|-\n|1988\n|28,446\n|-\n|1989\n|26,663\n|-\n|1990\n|18,921\n|-\n|1991\n|7,332\n|}\n\n==1992\u20131994==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Third generation\n| image = 1992 Chevrolet K5 Blazer.jpg\n| caption = 1992-1993 K1500 Blazer\n| aka = GMC Yukon\n| model_years = 1992\u20131994\n| production = 1991\u20131994\n| assembly = [[Janesville Assembly Plant]],<br>[[Janesville, Wisconsin]]\n| platform = [[GMT400|GMT415]]\n| engine = {{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Chevrolet small-block engine#L05|L05]] V8<br>{{convert|379|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2L|Detroit Diesel]] V8\n| transmission = 4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4|4L60]] automatic<br>5-speed manual\n}}\nFor 1992, GM redesigned its SUVs, moving to the [[GMT400]] architecture that had debuted for the 1988 pickup lines.

GM's smallest full-size SUV, it is part of the [[Chevrolet C/K]] truck family. Introduced to the [[Chevrolet]] line for the 1969 [[model year]], the K5 Blazer was replaced for 1995 by the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]. In 1970, [[GMC Truck|GMC]] introduced its own model of the truck, called the '''Jimmy''', which was discontinued in 1991 and replaced by the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Yukon]]. The \"Jimmy\" name was chosen to reflect how '''GM''' may sound in a similar manner to how ''[[Jeep]]'' was thought to be a pronunciation of GP in the competing market.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Both were short-[[wheelbase]] trucks and available with either rear- or [[four-wheel drive]].\n\nThe K5 Blazer and Jimmy had \"full convertible\" removable tops until 1975. For 1976, GM introduced a half-cab design that was less prone to leaks and slightly safer in a roll-over. These half cabs had the convertible top begin a few inches behind the driver/passenger doors and run back to the tailgate.\n\nThe Blazer's long-wheelbase relative, with an integrated rear body and doors for 2nd row passengers, is the [[Chevrolet Suburban]].  \n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==1969\u20131972==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=First generation\n|image=1972 K5 Blazer.jpg\n|model_years=1969\u20131972\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#292|{{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] I6<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]] <br> [[Chevrolet small-block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8\n|aka=GMC Jimmy\n|wheelbase= {{Convert|104|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1969\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1969_Trucks_and_Vans/1969_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure/1969%20Chevrolet%20Blazer-06.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1969_Trucks_and_Vans/1969_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n|transmission=3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH-350]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]] <br> 3-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>4-speed manual\n|length= {{Convert|177.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1969\"/><br>180\"(1971)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure/1971%20Chevy%20Blazer-08.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n|width= {{Convert|79|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1969\"/>\n}}\n[[File:'70 GMC Jimmy (Cruisin' At The Boardwalk '11).jpg|thumb|left|1970 GMC Jimmy]]\nThe original K5 was a short wheelbase [[truck]]. It was available in 1969 model year as four-wheel drive only; for 1970, a two-wheel drive model was offered. There were four choices for power plants: the ''[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#250|250]]'' [[straight-6]], the ''[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#292|292]]'' [[straight-6]], the ''[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#307|307]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]], and the ''[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#350|350]]'' V8.\n\nThe Blazer was designed and marketed to compete with [[International Harvester Scout]] and the [[Ford Bronco]]. Both of these were originally aimed at the short [[Jeep CJ]] series, which were much smaller than other trucks. The innovation of the Blazer was to simply offer a shortened pickup truck, which both increased interior space, and lowered the cost of production with a shared platform. The Blazer quickly became popular. For the first time, it married the off-road capabilities of the Scout with the \"luxury\" features like air conditioning and automatic transmissions routinely available on pickup trucks. By 1970, the Blazer was already outselling both of its older rivals. [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Dodge]], and even Jeep would counter with similar shortened pickups, with the [[Dodge Ramcharger]] and [[Jeep Cherokee (SJ)|Jeep Cherokee]]. It also came as a convertible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1969_Trucks_and_Vans/1969_Chevrolet_Blazer_Convertible_Top/1969%20Chevy%20Blazer%20Convertible%20Top-01.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1969_Trucks_and_Vans/1969_Chevrolet_Blazer_Convertible_Top |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n\nThe two-wheel drive version came with independent front suspension and rear trailing arms, both with coil springs. The four-wheel drive version had a solid front axle and used [[leaf spring]]s front and rear. Both versions used drum brakes at all four corners until 1971, when the entire GM light truck line got standard front discs. A tachometer was optional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure/1971%20Chevy%20Blazer-06.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1971_Trucks-Vans/1971_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n\nThere was also a choice between a three-speed [[automatic transmission]] Turbo Hydromatic (TH350), a three-speed [[manual transmission]], and a four-speed Synchromesh (SM465) manual transmission, often referred to as the \"granny gear\" due to its 6.55:1 low first gear. Two transfer cases were offered: the [[Dana Holding Corporation|Dana]] 20, available only with the manual transmissions, or the [[NP-205]], available with both types of transmissions. The Blazer had {{Convert|8|in|mm}} of ground clearance and an approach angle of 35\u00b0.<ref name=\"oldcarbrochures1969\"/>\n\nIn October 2019, a customized version of the first generation K5 Blazer was made using the entire body of a 2018 Chevrolet Tahoe was circulated throughout the social media world ahead of a scheduled display at the 2019 SEMA Show, and in honor of Blazer\u2019s 50th anniversary.<ref>[https://www.thedrive.com/news/30480/this-chevrolet-tahoe-and-k5-blazer-retro-mashup-will-make-your-brain-hurt \u201c2018 Chevrolet Tahoe and K5 Blazer Retro Mashup Will Make Your Brain Hurt\u201d] from The Drive (October 17, 2019)</ref>\n\n'''Engines''':\n*[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#250|250 in\u00b3]] (4.1 L) [[Straight-six engine|I6]] (1969\u20131984)\n*[[Chevrolet Straight-6 engine#292|292 in\u00b3]] (4.8 L) I6 (1970\u20131971)\n*[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#307|307 in\u00b3]] (5.0 L) [[V8 engine|V8]] (1969\u20131973)\n*[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#350|350 in\u00b3]] (5.7 L) V8 (1969\u20131991)\n\n'''Transfer cases''':\n*NP-205 - gear driven part-time four wheel drive\n*Dana 20 - gear driven part-time four-wheel drive\n\n'''Production Totals''':{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible autocollapse\"\n!Year\n!Production\n|-\n|1969\n|4,935\n|-\n|1970\n|11,527\n|-\n|1971\n|17,220\n|-\n|1972\n|44,266\n|}\n{{clear}}\n\n==1973\u20131991==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Second generation\n|image=Chevrolet K5 Blazer -- 09-07-2009.jpg\n|model_years=1973\u20131991\n|engine=[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#250|{{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]<br>[[Chevrolet straight-6 engine#292|{{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] I6<br>[[Chevrolet small-block engine#305|{{convert|305|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] [[V8 engine|V8]] <br> [[Chevrolet small-block engine#307|{{convert|307|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8<br>[[Chevrolet Small-Block engine#350|{{convert|350|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8 <br> [[Chevrolet small-block engine#400|{{convert|400|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}}]] V8<br>[[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2L|6.2 L Detroit Diesel]] V8\n|wheelbase={{convert|106.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length={{convert|184.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure/1973%20Chevrolet%20Blazer-08.html |title=Directory Index: GM Trucks and Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973_Chevrolet_Blazer_Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-20}}</ref>\n|aka=GMC Jimmy\n|width={{convert|79.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height={{convert|77.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|transmission=4-speed [[Muncie SM465 transmission|SM465]] [[manual transmission|manual]]<br>3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|TH-350]] [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br>3-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic|TH-400]] automatic<br>4-speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 / 4L60 / 4L60E / 4L65E|700-R4]] automatic\n}}\n[[File:Chevrolet K5 Blazer .jpg|right|thumb|1989\u20131991 K5 Blazer (Scottsdale trim)]]\n[[File:Chevrolet K5 Blazer.jpg|right|thumb|1981\u20131982 K5 Blazer]]\n[[File:M1009cucv.jpg|right|thumb|Military M1009 CUCV K5 Blazer]]\n[[File:K5 with Snowplow.jpg|right|thumb|1985\u20131988 K5 Blazer equipped for snow plowing]]\n[[File:Chevrolet_Blazer_1500_Silverado_6,2_Diesel.jpg|thumb|1990 Blazer 1500 Silverado 6.2 Diesel]]\n\nFor 1973, GM's line of full-size trucks was redesigned and updated.

In 1976, a half-cab design was introduced and used until 1991.<ref name='specs-76'>{{cite web|url=http://coloradok5.com/specs.shtml#1976|title=Chevy Blazer specifications|work=ColoradoK5.com|publisher=Performance Media Group, Inc|accessdate= 2009-10-05}}</ref><ref name=76p4>{{citation|title=Blazer '76 catalog|date=September 1975|page=4|publisher=Chevrolet Motor Division|url=http://www.coloradok5.com/brochures/1976/blazer4.jpg|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708175554/http://coloradok5.com/brochures/1976/blazer4.jpg|archivedate=2011-07-08}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[GM GMT platform#GMT 400|GMT400 platform]] was introduced in the spring of 1987 as a 1988 model, the K5 Blazer, Suburban, and crew-cab trucks retained the earlier platform until 1991. For in late 1988 for 1989 models, the front grille was changed to resemble the squared-off ones used on the GMT400 series of pickups.\n\nThe K5 Blazer was fitted with a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} inline-six as standard through 1984. Available engines included a {{convert|292|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} inline-six, small-block V8s of 305, 307, 350, or 400 cubic inches (5.0, 5.0, 5.7, and 6.6 liters), and a 6.2&nbsp;L Detroit Diesel V8.\n\n1973\u20131980 Blazers used the gear-driven part-time NP-205 transfer case (mostly mated to the SM465 manual transmission and some TH350s) or the chain-driven full-time NP-203 transfer case (mated to the TH350 automatic) and DANA-44 front/12-bolt rear axle combination through 1980. Starting in 1981 used the chain-driven NP208 transfer case (NP241 after 1988) with front 10-bolt/rear 10-bolt axle combinations until 1991. There is an overlap of 12-bolt rears into the early '80s, while the 10-bolt front axle was phased into production in the late 1970s.\n\nThe second generation K5 models incorporated the rear hatch glass and tailgate into a single unit, which allowed the glass panel to retract inside of the tailgate by use of a manual crank mounted on the tailgate or an electric motor activated by a key-operated switch on the tailgate and a dash-mounted switch. The weight of the large glass panel was rumored to be a liability as the manual crank gears wore prematurely and the electric motor was prone to frequent overheating and subsequent failure. This also included the electric motor drive cable which goes to the window regulator to the motor (similar in design to a speedometer cable), which usually would fail under heavy abuse. Another feature of the K5 Blazer tailgate was the safety switch connected to the electric motor which prevented the rear window from being raised if the tailgate was unlatched.\n\nSince 1981 (in the wake of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 Arab Oil Embargo]] and the [[1979 energy crisis]]), Chevrolet and GMC used the smaller displacement 305s with a 9.2:1 compression ratio. These engines produced nearly as much torque as the 350, giving a similar driving feel. However, these power plants were underpowered and prone to [[detonation]] ([[engine knocking]]), especially with the electronic spark control module. To achieve the 9.2:1 compression ratio, the cylinder head chambers were smaller, measuring 56&nbsp;cc instead of 76&nbsp;cc.\n\nAround 1976, a prototype K5 Blazer <ref>July 1976 FourWheeler magazine</ref> was used as a testbed for a military [[CUCV]] vehicle built by Vic Hickey, father of the HUMVEE. Between 1983 and 1987, what is known as the M1009 [[CUCV]] was the production militarized version of the civilian K5. The differences are the lack of an air conditioner, an additional leaf spring in the suspension, a hybrid 12/24&nbsp;V electrical system (described in detail below), blackout headlights, front mounted brush guard, a rifle rack, and special paint jobs. A majority of them are painted [[olive drab]] green or in the [[M81 Woodland|woodland]] camouflage pattern, though some vehicles that saw desert use were painted tan. All M1009s, including its derivatives, are powered with the 6.2 L Diesel power plant.\n\nThe M1009s have a split 24/12&nbsp;V electrical system. Most of the truck actually runs on 12&nbsp;V. It has two separate 12&nbsp;V alternators and batteries wired in series, only the glow plug system, injection pump, the starter, and the jumper cable jack are wired to the 24&nbsp;V terminals. everything else in the truck runs on 12&nbsp;V. The glow plugs are actually 12&nbsp;V glow plugs with a resistor pack on the firewall to drop the 24&nbsp;V down to 12&nbsp;V. This resistor pack can be bypassed and the glow plugs run directly off of the 12&nbsp;V battery. If this is done and the 24&nbsp;V starter is replaced with a standard 12v starter, the second alternator is no longer needed. (If this is done then the military 24&nbsp;V slave adapter in the grille will need to be disconnected as well.)\n\nSome decommissioned M1009s end up in law enforcement use (e.g. with the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]) or sold through government auctions, but a handful are still in use by the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]].\n\nAfter 1987, when [[Fuel injection#Throttle body injection|throttle-body injection]] was introduced in the truck engines, the 350 was made the standard power plant.\n\n[[General Motors|GM]] temporarily changed the usual \"[[Chevrolet C/K|C/K]]\" designation to \"R\" and \"V\" for the 1987 through 1991 model years. This was done to avoid confusion with the GMT400-based Chevrolet C/K pickup trucks, which were introduced in 1988, during the overlap period.\n\nIn 1988, four new colors were introduced: Bright Blue Metallic, Forest Green Metallic, Light Mesa Brown Metallic, and Dark Mesa Brown Metallic. More new features for 1988 included a fixed mast antenna in place of the old windshield antenna, a trip odometer as part of the gauge package cluster, and an improved pulse windshield wiper control. Also, helping to reduce air leaks in the doors was a new door handle seal.\n\nThe 1989 Blazer had new base and up-level grilles, as well as new headlight bezels, body side moldings, and front bumper rub strips. Corporate 10-bolt axles were upgraded to 30 spline axle shafts from previous 28 spline. New for 1989 was the introduction of an all-new base coat/clear coat paint. The standard L05 5.7-liter V-8 now had one serpentine accessory drive belt in place of the older multi-belt accessory drive setup. 1989 was first year for the  241 transfer case and also the only year for speedometer cable driven version of the 241. \n\nFor the 1990 model year, all Blazers now had a standard rear wheel anti-lock braking system. A new electronic speedometer system, with a 6 digit odometer on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990, along with non-asbestos brake linings. A new brake warning light on the dashboard was also introduced for 1990. The Blazer body also used double sided, galvanized exterior sheet metal. A new option for 1990 was power mirrors. The 5.7 liter V8 (L05) engine was improved for 1990 with the addition of improved oil control rings, a redesigned rear crankshaft seal, a new camshaft sprocket design, non-asbestos intake manifold gaskets, and heavy-duty intake valves. 3 point shoulder harness also become standard for rear passengers. The rear seat arm rest were eliminated from rear seat to make room for shoulder belts and pads were added to the wheel housings. \n\nFor 1991, the 700R4 was renamed to the 4L60. The TBI (throttle body injection) system used on the Blazer's standard 5.7 liter V8 had longer throttle shaft bearings, new throttle return springs, and improved fuel mixture distribution.  The 5.7 liter V8 also had new heavy-duty intake valves and powdered metal camshaft sprockets. Standard on all engines was a lighter more powerful 100-amp CS130 alternator.

{"title_page": "Modes of mechanical ventilation", "text_new": "{{short description|The methods of inspiratory support}}\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2020}}\n'''Modes of mechanical ventilation''' are one of the most important aspects of the usage of [[mechanical ventilation]]. The mode refers to the method of inspiratory support. In general, mode selection is based on [[Respiratory therapist|clinician]] familiarity and institutional preferences, since there is a paucity of evidence indicating that the mode affects clinical outcome.  The most frequently used forms of volume-limited mechanical ventilation are intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) and continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Esteban A, Anzueto A, Al\u00eda I, Gordo F, Apeztegu\u00eda C, P\u00e1lizas F, Cide D, Goldwaser R, Soto L, Bugedo G, Rodrigo C, Pimentel J, Raimondi G, Tobin MJ |title=How is mechanical ventilation employed in the intensive care unit?

Inspiratory time is defined as the period from the start of positive flow to the start of negative flow. Expiratory time is defined as the period from the start of expiratory flow to the start of inspiratory flow. The flow-time curve is the basis for many variables related to ventilator settings.\n#A breath is assisted if the ventilator does work on the patient. An assisted breath is one for which the ventilator does some portion of the work of breathing. For constant flow inflation, work is defined as inspiratory pressure multiplied by tidal volume. Therefore, an assisted breath is identified as a breath for which airway pressure (displayed on the ventilator) rises above baseline during inspiration. An unassisted breath is one for which the ventilator simply provides the inspiratory flow demanded by the patient and pressure stays constant throughout the breath. \n#A ventilator assists breathing using either pressure control or volume control based on the equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact is known as the equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: <blockquote>Pressure = (Elastance \u00d7 Volume) + (Resistance \u00d7 Flow)</blockquote>In this equation, pressure, volume, and flow are all continuous functions of time. Pressure is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). Elastance (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.<blockquote>Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a constant value or it is proportional to the patient\u2019s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and flow change with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (pressure, volume, or flow) are preset. In this case only the inspiratory and expiratory times are preset.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified by the criteria that trigger (start) and cycle (stop) inspiration. The start of inspiration is called the trigger event. The end of inspiration is called the cycle event.\n#Trigger and cycle events can be initiated by the patient or the machine. Inspiration can be patient triggered or patient cycled by a signal representing inspiratory effort. Inspiration may also be machine triggered or machine cycled by preset ventilator thresholds. <blockquote>Patient triggering means starting inspiration based on a patient signal independent of a machine trigger signal. Machine triggering means starting inspiratory flow based on a signal from the ventilator, independent of a patient trigger signal. Patient cycling means ending inspiratory time based on signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion, (ie, elastance or resistance and including effects due to inspiratory effort). Flow cycling is a form of patient cycling because the rate of flow decay to the cycle threshold is determined by patient mechanics.  Machine cycling means ending inspiratory time independent of signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous breath is a breath for which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory breath (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory breath is a breath for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory breath is, by definition, assisted.\n#There are 3 breath sequences: Continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV), Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV), and Continuous Spontaneous Ventilation (CSV). A breath sequence is a particular pattern of spontaneous and/or mandatory breaths. The 3 possible breath sequences are: continuous mandatory ventilation, (CMV, spontaneous breaths are not allowed between mandatory breaths), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV, spontaneous breaths may occur between mandatory breaths), and continuous spontaneous ventilation (CSV, all breaths are spontaneous).\n#There are 5 basic ventilatory patterns: VC-CMV, VC-IMV, PC-CMV, PC-IMV, and PC-CSV. The combination VC-CSV is not possible because volume control implies machine cycling and machine cycling makes every breath mandatory, not spontaneous. A sixth pattern, TC-IMV is possible but rare.  \n#Within each ventilatory pattern there are several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a \u201czone of comfort\u201d (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: <blockquote>Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all the parameters of the pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).<br>Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.<br>Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.<br>Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.<br>Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).<br>Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).<br>Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as [[fuzzy logic]], rule based [[expert system]]s, and [[artificial neural network]]s.</blockquote>\n#A mode of ventilation is classified according to its control variable, breath sequence, and targeting scheme(s). The preceding 9 maxims create a theoretical foundation for a taxonomy of mechanical ventilation. The taxonomy is based on these theoretical constructs and has 4 hierarchical levels:\n*Control Variable (Pressure or Volume, for the primary breath)\n*Breath Sequence (CMV, IMV, or CSV)\n*Primary Breath Targeting Scheme (for CMV or CSV)\n*Secondary Breath Targeting Scheme (for IMV)\n\n<blockquote>The \u201cprimary breath\u201d is either the only breath there is (mandatory for CMV and spontaneous for CSV) or it is the mandatory breath in IMV. The targeting schemes can be represented by single, lower case letters: set-point = s, dual = d, servo = r, bio-variable = b, adaptive = a, optimal = o, intelligent = i. \nA tag is an abbreviation for a mode classification, such as PC-IMVs,s. Compound tags are possible, eg, PC-IMVoi,oi.</blockquote>\n\n=== How modes are classified ===\nStep 1: Identify the primary breath control variable. If inspiration starts with a preset inspiratory pressure, or if pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort, then the control variable is pressure. If inspiration starts with a preset tidal volume and inspiratory flow, then the control variable is volume. If neither is true, the control variable is time.\n\nStep 2: Identify the breath sequence. Determine whether trigger and cycle events are patient or machine determined. Then, use this information to determine the breath sequence.\n\nStep 3: Identify the targeting schemes for the primary breaths and (if applicable) secondary breaths.\n\n=== Example mode classification is given below ===\nMode Name: A/C Volume Control (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#Inspiratory volume and flow are preset, so the control variable is volume.\n#Every breath is volume cycled, which is a form of machine cycling. Any breath for which inspiration is machine cycled is classified as a mandatory breath. Hence, the breath sequence is continuous mandatory ventilation. \n#The operator sets all the parameters of the volume and flow waveforms so the targeting scheme is set-point. Thus, the mode is classified as volume control continuous mandatory ventilation with set-point targeting (VC-CMVs).\nMode Name: SIMV Volume Control Plus (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#The operator sets the tidal volume but not the inspiratory flow. Because setting volume alone (like setting flow alone) is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for volume control, the control variable is pressure. \n#Spontaneous breaths are allowed between mandatory breaths so the breath sequence is IMV{{what?|date=March 2020}}. \n#The ventilator adjusts inspiratory pressure between breaths to achieve an average preset tidal volume, so the targeting scheme is adaptive. The mode tag is PC-IMVa,s.\n\n== Descriptions of common modes ==\n\nMechanical ventilation machines are available with both invasive modes (such as [[intubation]]) and non-invasive modes (such as [[BPAP machine|BPAP]].  Invasive has to do with the insertion of medical devices or tubes internal to the patient, while non-invasive is completely external to the patient, as for example in using a tightly-fitting mask or other device that covers the patient's nose and mouth.\n\n=== Assist mode, control mode, and assist-control mode ===\nA basic distinction in mechanical ventilation is whether each breath is initiated by the patient (assist mode) or by the machine (control mode). Dynamic hybrids of the two (assist-control modes) are also possible, and control mode without assist is now mostly obsolete.\n\n=== Airway pressure release ventilation ===\n[[File:Airway pressure release ventilation graph.png|thumb|Airway pressure release ventilation graph]]\n[[Airway pressure release ventilation]] is a time-cycled alternant between two levels of positive airway pressure, with the main time on the high level and a brief expiratory release to facilitate ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Dietrich Henzler | title = What on earth is APRV? | journal = [[Critical Care (journal)|Critical Care]] | location = London, England | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 115 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1186/cc9419 | pmid = 21345265 | pmc=3222047| author-link = Dietrich Henzler }}</ref>\n\nAirway pressure release ventilation is usually utilized as a type of inverse ratio ventilation.

Although similar in modality, these terms describe how a mode is intended to inflate the lung, rather than defining the characteristics of synchronization or the way spontaneous breathing efforts are supported.\n\nIntermittent mandatory ventilation has not always had the synchronized feature, so the division of modes were understood to be SIMV (synchronized) vs IMV (not-synchronized). Since the [[American Association for Respiratory Care]] established a [[nomenclature of mechanical ventilation]] the \"synchronized\" part of the title has been dropped and now there is only IMV.\n\n=== Mandatory minute ventilation ===\nMandatory minute ventilation (MMV) allows spontaneous breathing with automatic adjustments of mandatory ventilation to the meet the patient's preset minimum minute volume requirement. If the patient maintains the minute volume settings for V<sub>T</sub> x f, no mandatory breaths are delivered.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIf the patient's minute volume is insufficient, mandatory delivery of the preset tidal volume will occur until the minute volume is achieved.  The method for monitoring whether or not the patient is meeting the required minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) differs by ventilator brand and model, but, in general, there is a window of monitored time, and a smaller window checked against the larger window (i.e., in the Dr\u00e4ger Evita\u00ae line of mechanical ventilators there is a moving 20-second window, and every 7 seconds the current tidal volume and rate are measured) to decide whether a mechanical breath is needed to maintain the minute ventilation.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMMV is an optimal mode for weaning in neonatal and pediatric populations and has been shown to reduce long-term complications related to mechanical ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal  | author = [[Scott O.

Pressure-regulated volume control utilizes pressure-limited, volume-targeted, time-cycled breaths that can be either ventilator- or patient-initiated.\n\nThe peak inspiratory pressure delivered by the ventilator is varied on a breath-to-breath basis to achieve a target tidal volume that is set by the clinician.\n\nFor example, if a target tidal volume of 500 mL is set but the ventilator delivers 600 mL, the next breath will be delivered with a lower inspiratory pressure to achieve a lower tidal volume.  Though PRVC is regarded as a hybrid mode because of its tidal-volume (VC) settings and pressure-limiting (PC) settings fundamentally PRVC is a pressure-control mode with adaptive targeting.\n\n===Continuous positive airway pressure===\n[[Continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) is a non-invasive positive pressure mode of respiratory support. CPAP is a pressure applied at the end of exhalation to keep the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, an appropriate increase in CPAP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>. CPAP is not technically a mode of \"ventilation\" as it does not directly affect the [[minute volume]].\n\n====Automatic positive airway pressure====\n[[Positive airway pressure#Automatic positive airway pressure|Automatic positive airway pressure]] (APAP) is a form of CPAP that automatically tunes the amount of pressure delivered to the patient to the minimum required to maintain an unobstructed airway on a breath-by-breath basis by measuring the resistance in the patient's breathing.\n\n=== Bilevel positive airway pressure ===\n[[Bilevel positive airway pressure]] (BPAP) is a mode used during [[non-invasive ventilation]] (NIV).  First used in 1988 by Professor Benzer in Austria,<ref>Benzer H (1988) Ventilatory support by intermittent changes in PEEP levels. 4th European Congress on Intensive Care Medicine. Baveno-Stresa</ref> it delivers a preset inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP).

Inspiratory time is defined as the period from the start of positive flow to the start of negative flow. Expiratory time is defined as the period from the start of expiratory flow to the start of inspiratory flow. The flow-time curve is the basis for many variables related to ventilator settings.\n#A breath is assisted if the ventilator does work on the patient. An assisted breath is one for which the ventilator does some portion of the work of breathing. For constant flow inflation, work is defined as inspiratory pressure multiplied by tidal volume. Therefore, an assisted breath is identified as a breath for which airway pressure (displayed on the ventilator) rises above baseline during inspiration. An unassisted breath is one for which the ventilator simply provides the inspiratory flow demanded by the patient and pressure stays constant throughout the breath. \n#A ventilator assists breathing using either pressure control or volume control based on the equation of motion for the respiratory system. Providing assistance means doing work on the patient, which is accomplished by controlling either pressure or volume. A simple mathematical model describing this fact is known as the equation of motion for the passive respiratory system: <blockquote>Pressure = (Elastance \u00d7 Volume) + (Resistance \u00d7 Flow)</blockquote>In this equation, pressure, volume, and flow are all continuous functions of time. Pressure is actually a pressure difference across the system (e.g., transrespiratory pressure defined as pressure at the airway opening minus pressure on the body surface). Elastance (defined as the change in pressure divided by the associated change in volume; the reciprocal of compliance) and resistance (defined as a change in pressure divided by the associated change in flow) are parameters assumed to remain constant during a breath.<blockquote>Volume control (VC) means that both volume and flow are preset prior to inspiration. In other words, the right hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while pressure changes with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Pressure control (PC) means that inspiratory pressure is preset as either a constant value or it is proportional to the patient\u2019s inspiratory effort. In other words, the left-hand side of the equation of motion remains constant while volume and flow change with changes in elastance and resistance.<br>Time control (TC) means that, in some rare situations, none of the main variables (pressure, volume, or flow) are preset. In this case only the inspiratory and expiratory times are preset.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified by the criteria that trigger (start) and cycle (stop) inspiration. The start of inspiration is called the trigger event. The end of inspiration is called the cycle event.\n#Trigger and cycle events can be initiated by the patient or the machine. Inspiration can be patient triggered or patient cycled by a signal representing inspiratory effort. Inspiration may also be machine triggered or machine cycled by preset ventilator thresholds. <blockquote>Patient triggering means starting inspiration based on a patient signal independent of a machine trigger signal. Machine triggering means starting inspiratory flow based on a signal from the ventilator, independent of a patient trigger signal. Patient cycling means ending inspiratory time based on signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion, (ie, elastance or resistance and including effects due to inspiratory effort). Flow cycling is a form of patient cycling because the rate of flow decay to the cycle threshold is determined by patient mechanics.  Machine cycling means ending inspiratory time independent of signals representing the patient determined components of the equation of motion.</blockquote>\n#Breaths are classified as spontaneous or mandatory based on both the trigger and cycle events. A spontaneous breath is a breath for which the patient both triggers and cycles the breath. A spontaneous breath may occur during a mandatory breath (e.g. Airway Pressure Release Ventilation). A spontaneous breath may be assisted or unassisted. A mandatory breath is a breath for which the machine triggers and/or cycles the breath. A mandatory breath can occur during a spontaneous breath (e.g., High Frequency Jet Ventilation). A mandatory breath is, by definition, assisted.\n#There are 3 breath sequences: Continuous mandatory ventilation (CMV), Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (IMV), and Continuous Spontaneous Ventilation (CSV). A breath sequence is a particular pattern of spontaneous and/or mandatory breaths. The 3 possible breath sequences are: continuous mandatory ventilation, (CMV, spontaneous breaths are not allowed between mandatory breaths), intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV, spontaneous breaths may occur between mandatory breaths), and continuous spontaneous ventilation (CSV, all breaths are spontaneous).\n#There are 5 basic ventilatory patterns: VC-CMV, VC-IMV, PC-CMV, PC-IMV, and PC-CSV. The combination VC-CSV is not possible because volume control implies machine cycling and machine cycling makes every breath mandatory, not spontaneous. A sixth pattern, TC-IMV is possible but rare.  \n#Within each ventilatory pattern there are several variations that can be distinguished by their targeting scheme(s). A targeting scheme is a description of how the ventilator achieves preset targets. A target is a predetermined goal of ventilator output. Examples of within-breath targets include inspiratory flow or pressure and rise time (set-point targeting), tidal volume (dual targeting) and constant of proportionality between inspiratory pressure and patient effort (servo targeting). Examples of between-breath targets and targeting schemes include average tidal volume (for adaptive targeting), percent minute ventilation (for optimal targeting) and combined PCO2, volume, and frequency values describing a \u201czone of comfort\u201d (for intelligent targeting, e.g., SmartCarePS or IntelliVent-ASV). The targeting scheme (or combination of targeting schemes) is what distinguishes one ventilatory pattern from another. There are 7 basic targeting schemes that comprise the wide variety seen in different modes of ventilation: <blockquote>Set-point: A targeting scheme for which the operator sets all the parameters of the pressure waveform (pressure control modes) or volume and flow waveforms (volume control modes).<br>Dual: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to switch between volume control and pressure control during a single inspiration.<br>Bio-variable: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set the inspiratory pressure or tidal volume randomly to mimic the variability observed during normal breathing.<br>Servo: A targeting scheme for which inspiratory pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort.<br>Adaptive: A targeting scheme that allows the ventilator to automatically set one target (eg, pressure within a breath) to achieve another target (eg, average tidal volume over several breaths).<br>Optimal: A targeting scheme that automatically adjusts the targets of the ventilatory pattern to either minimize or maximize some overall performance characteristic (eg, minimize the work rate done by the ventilatory pattern).<br>Intelligent: A targeting scheme that uses artificial intelligence programs such as [[fuzzy logic]], rule based [[expert system]]s, and [[artificial neural network]]s.</blockquote>\n#A mode of ventilation is classified according to its control variable, breath sequence, and targeting scheme(s). The preceding 9 maxims create a theoretical foundation for a taxonomy of mechanical ventilation. The taxonomy is based on these theoretical constructs and has 4 hierarchical levels:\n*Control Variable (Pressure or Volume, for the primary breath)\n*Breath Sequence (CMV, IMV, or CSV)\n*Primary Breath Targeting Scheme (for CMV or CSV)\n*Secondary Breath Targeting Scheme (for IMV)\n\n<blockquote>The \u201cprimary breath\u201d is either the only breath there is (mandatory for CMV and spontaneous for CSV) or it is the mandatory breath in IMV. The targeting schemes can be represented by single, lower case letters: set-point = s, dual = d, servo = r, bio-variable = b, adaptive = a, optimal = o, intelligent = i. \nA tag is an abbreviation for a mode classification, such as PC-IMVs,s. Compound tags are possible, eg, PC-IMVoi,oi.</blockquote>\n\n=== How modes are classified ===\nStep 1: Identify the primary breath control variable. If inspiration starts with a preset inspiratory pressure, or if pressure is proportional to inspiratory effort, then the control variable is pressure. If inspiration starts with a preset tidal volume and inspiratory flow, then the control variable is volume. If neither is true, the control variable is time.\n\nStep 2: Identify the breath sequence. Determine whether trigger and cycle events are patient or machine determined. Then, use this information to determine the breath sequence.\n\nStep 3: Identify the targeting schemes for the primary breaths and (if applicable) secondary breaths.\n\n=== Example mode classification is given below ===\nMode Name: A/C Volume Control (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#Inspiratory volume and flow are preset, so the control variable is volume.\n#Every breath is volume cycled, which is a form of machine cycling. Any breath for which inspiration is machine cycled is classified as a mandatory breath. Hence, the breath sequence is continuous mandatory ventilation. \n#The operator sets all the parameters of the volume and flow waveforms so the targeting scheme is set-point. Thus, the mode is classified as volume control continuous mandatory ventilation with set-point targeting (VC-CMVs).\nMode Name: SIMV Volume Control Plus (Covidien PB 840):{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n#The operator sets the tidal volume but not the inspiratory flow. Because setting volume alone (like setting flow alone) is a necessary but not sufficient criterion for volume control, the control variable is pressure. \n#Spontaneous breaths are allowed between mandatory breaths so the breath sequence is IMV{{what?|date=March 2020}}. \n#The ventilator adjusts inspiratory pressure between breaths to achieve an average preset tidal volume, so the targeting scheme is adaptive. The mode tag is PC-IMVa,s.\n\n== Descriptions of common modes ==\n\nMechanical ventilation machines are available with both invasive modes (such as [[intubation]]) and non-invasive modes (such as [[BPAP machine|BPAP]].  Invasive has to do with the insertion of medical devices or tubes internal to the patient, while non-invasive is completely external to the patient, as for example in using a tightly-fitting mask or other device that covers the patient's nose and mouth.\n\n=== Assist mode, control mode, and assist-control mode ===\nA basic distinction in mechanical ventilation is whether each breath is initiated by the patient (assist mode) or by the machine (control mode). Dynamic hybrids of the two (assist-control modes) are also possible, and control mode without assist is now mostly obsolete.\n\n=== Airway pressure release ventilation ===\n[[File:Airway pressure release ventilation graph.png|thumb|Airway pressure release ventilation graph]]\n[[Airway pressure release ventilation]] is a time-cycled alternant between two levels of positive airway pressure, with the main time on the high level and a brief expiratory release to facilitate ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Dietrich Henzler | title = What on earth is APRV? | journal = [[Critical Care (journal)|Critical Care]] | location = London, England | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 115 | year = 2011 | doi = 10.1186/cc9419 | pmid = 21345265 | pmc=3222047| author-link = Dietrich Henzler }}</ref>\n\nAirway pressure release ventilation is usually utilized as a type of inverse ratio ventilation.

Although similar in modality, these terms describe how a mode is intended to inflate the lung, rather than defining the characteristics of synchronization or the way spontaneous breathing efforts are supported.\n\nIntermittent mandatory ventilation has not always had the synchronized feature, so the division of modes were understood to be SIMV (synchronized) vs IMV (not-synchronized). Since the [[American Association for Respiratory Care]] established a [[nomenclature of mechanical ventilation]] the \"synchronized\" part of the title has been dropped and now there is only IMV.\n\n=== Mandatory minute ventilation ===\nMandatory minute ventilation (MMV) allows spontaneous breathing with automatic adjustments of mandatory ventilation to the meet the patient's preset minimum minute volume requirement. If the patient maintains the minute volume settings for V<sub>T</sub> x f, no mandatory breaths are delivered.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nIf the patient's minute volume is insufficient, mandatory delivery of the preset tidal volume will occur until the minute volume is achieved.  The method for monitoring whether or not the patient is meeting the required minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>) differs by ventilator brand and model, but, in general, there is a window of monitored time, and a smaller window checked against the larger window (i.e., in the Dr\u00e4ger Evita\u00ae line of mechanical ventilators there is a moving 20-second window, and every 7 seconds the current tidal volume and rate are measured) to decide whether a mechanical breath is needed to maintain the minute ventilation.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nMMV is an optimal mode for weaning in neonatal and pediatric populations and has been shown to reduce long-term complications related to mechanical ventilation.<ref>{{Cite journal  | author = [[Scott O.

Pressure-regulated volume control utilizes pressure-limited, volume-targeted, time-cycled breaths that can be either ventilator- or patient-initiated.\n\nThe peak inspiratory pressure delivered by the ventilator is varied on a breath-to-breath basis to achieve a target tidal volume that is set by the clinician.\n\nFor example, if a target tidal volume of 500 mL is set but the ventilator delivers 600 mL, the next breath will be delivered with a lower inspiratory pressure to achieve a lower tidal volume.  Though PRVC is regarded as a hybrid mode because of its tidal-volume (VC) settings and pressure-limiting (PC) settings fundamentally PRVC is a pressure-control mode with adaptive targeting.\n\n===Continuous positive airway pressure===\n[[Continuous positive airway pressure]] (CPAP) is a non-invasive positive pressure mode of respiratory support. CPAP is a pressure applied at the end of exhalation to keep the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, an appropriate increase in CPAP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>. CPAP is not technically a mode of \"ventilation\" as it does not directly affect the [[minute volume]].\n\n====Automatic positive airway pressure====\n[[Positive airway pressure#Automatic positive airway pressure|Automatic positive airway pressure]] (APAP) is a form of CPAP that automatically tunes the amount of pressure delivered to the patient to the minimum required to maintain an unobstructed airway on a breath-by-breath basis by measuring the resistance in the patient's breathing.\n\n=== Bilevel positive airway pressure ===\n[[Bilevel positive airway pressure]] (BPAP) is a mode used during [[non-invasive ventilation]] (NIV).  First used in 1988 by Professor Benzer in Austria,<ref>Benzer H (1988) Ventilatory support by intermittent changes in PEEP levels. 4th European Congress on Intensive Care Medicine. Baveno-Stresa</ref> it delivers a preset inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP).

In a HFV-P scenario, the ventilator uses pressure to apply an inspiratory breath and then returns to atmospheric pressure to allow for a passive expiration.  This is seen in High-Frequency Jet Ventilation, sometimes abbreviated HFJV. Also categorized under High Frequency Ventilation  is High Frequency Percussive Ventilation, sometimes abbreviated HFPV. With HFPV it utilizes an open circuit to deliver its subtidal volumes by way of the patient interface known as the Phasitron.\n\n=== Volume guarantee ===\nVolume guarantee an additional parameter available in many types of ventilators that allows the ventilator to change its inspiratory pressure setting to achieve a minimum tidal volume.  This is utilized most often in neonatal patients who need a pressure controlled mode with a consideration for volume control to minimize [[volutrauma]].\n\n== Spontaneous breathing and support settings ==\n\n=== Positive end-expiratory pressure ===\n[[Positive end expiratory pressure]] (PEEP) is pressure applied upon expiration.  PEEP is applied using either a valve that is connected to the expiratory port and set manually or a valve managed internally by a mechanical ventilator.\n\nPEEP is a pressure that an exhalation has to bypass, in effect causing [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] to remain open and not fully deflate.  This mechanism for maintaining inflated alveoli helps increase partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, and an increase in PEEP increases the PaO<sub>2</sub>.<ref name=\"D. P. Schuster, M.

With support from the ventilator, the patient also regulates their own [[respiratory rate]] and their [[Lung volumes|tidal volume]].\n\nIn Pressure Support, the set inspiratory pressure support level is kept constant and there is a decelerating flow. The patient triggers all breaths. If there is a change in the mechanical properties of the lung/thorax and patient effort, the delivered tidal volume will be affected.
