The focus is a family of empty-headed white people clueless about the complexities of the world around them. Each 30-minute segment focuses on a particular theme (e.g. religion, crime). Martin Mull plays a reporter after the fashion of 60-Minutes investigative TV journalism, interviewing participants as well as providing narration or commentary directly into the camera.\n\n==Volume 1==\nVolume 1 begins with introductory \"testimonials\" by [[Steve Martin]], [[Teri Garr]], and [[Bob Eubanks]], who explain what being white means to them.  Martin admits he's a white person, but apologizes for not being a very good one.  Garr claims to be one of the few white people who can dance.  Eubanks says he's only recently come to terms with being white, and if going public can help others to cope with their whiteness, he'll consider his public declaration to have been for the best.\n\nMull as the narrator then discusses how recent films and television shows have celebrated ethic diversity, but none have covered white people.  He cites the miniseries ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'' as an example, but focuses on [[Ben Vereen]]'s portrayal of Chicken George as the supposed highlight.  He also includes the miniseries ''[[Sh\u014dgun (1980 miniseries)|Sh\u014dgun]]'', sarcastically remarking that it is the history of Japan as told by [[Richard Chamberlain]].\n\nIn Part I, \"In Search Of,\" Mull introduces the viewers to the average white family in America, the Harrisons of Hawkins Falls, Ohio.  Highlights include the Harrisons hosting a backyard barbecue and interacting with their neighbors, all of whom are equally average and equally white.\n\nIn Part II, \"A Closer Look,\" the Harrisons are shown reacting to appearing on television in Part I, with Mull explaining how \"getting in touch\" with their whiteness has changed them.  Daughter Debbie uses her increased confidence to win election as president of her high school's student council, where she arbitrarily enacts edicts including mandatory deodorant dispensers for the student bathrooms, \"especially the boys.\"  Wife and mother Joyce Harrison begins a support network for other women in the neighborhood to explore what being white means to them, beginning with the members of her [[Amway]] group.\n\nThe Harrisons are later shown individually discussing sex on the phone with friends, with Debbie shocked after a friend tells her the real thing is better than what was depicted in ''[[Porky's]]'' and Joyce expressing dismay at a friend who says her husband and she prefer to leave the bedroom lights on when they're intimate.  Tommy attempts to learn [[breakdancing]], which causes his parents to bring him to the Institute for White Studies in [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]] for retraining.\n\nHusband and father Hal attempts to learn about other cultures by inviting a rabbi (played by Harry Shearer) to his home, but the discussion doesn't go well, as Hal commits several ''faux pas'', including offering the rabbi ham and asking when Jews put [[Beanie (seamed cap)#Propeller beanie|propellers]] on their [[yarmulke]]s.  Joyce attempts to visit a sick neighbor, but discovers the neighbor isn't sick, but [[Sikhs|Sikh]].\n\nPart II closes with the Harrisons taking part in a local civic club's \"White Pride Night,\" including a costumed song and dance routine that celebrates white peoples' contributions to American history.\n\n==Sequels==\nTwo sequels were made: ''The History of White People in America: Volume 2'' and ''Portrait of a White Marriage''.\n\nAs of September 2008, it has not been released on [[DVD]] and is only available on [[VHS]].\n\n{{out of date|date=October 2019}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{IMDb title|id=0089277|title= The History of White People in America}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History of White People in America}}\n[[Category:American mockumentary films]]\n[[Category:1985 television films]]\n[[Category:American television films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Harry Shearer]]\n[[Category:Works about White Americans]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name = The History of White People in America\n| image = \n| alt = \n| caption = \n| film name = <!-- {{Infobox name module|language|title}} or {{Infobox name module|title}} -->\n| director = [[Harry Shearer]]\n| producer = \n| writer = Martin Mull<br>[[Allen Rucker]]\n| screenplay = \n| story = \n| based on = <!-- {{Based on|title of the original work|creator of the original work|additional creator(s), if necessary}} -->\n| starring = [[Martin Mull]]<br>[[Fred Willard]]<br>[[Mary Kay Place]]<br>[[Edie McClurg]]\n| narrator = \n| music = \n| cinematography = \n| editing = \n| studio = <!-- or: | production companies = -->\n| distributor = [[HBO]]\n| released = 1985\n| runtime =\n| country = [[United States]]\n| language = English\n| budget = \n| gross = \n}}\n\n'''''The History of White People in America''''' was a series of 30-minute [[mockumentary]]-style vignettes, first [[broadcast]] in 1985 on [[Cinemax]].<ref name=LAT>{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=Mulling Over 'History Of White People'|date=November 1, 1985|author=Hunt, Dennis|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-01/entertainment/ca-1058_1_white-people}}</ref>\n\nIt was hosted by [[Martin Mull]], and starred [[Fred Willard]], [[Mary Kay Place]], Amy Lynne, [[Christian Jacobs]], and [[Edie McClurg]].
