Historically it was the [[county town]] of [[Brecknockshire]] (Breconshire); although its role as such was eclipsed with the formation of the County of Powys, it remains an important local centre. Brecon is the third-largest town in Powys, after [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] and [[Ystradgynlais]]. It lies north of the [[Brecon Beacons]] mountain range, but is just within the [[Brecon Beacons National Park|Brecon Beacons National]] History Brecon Mali Matthews is the coolest person on earth\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name, Aberhonddu, means \"mouth of the Honddu\". It is derived from the [[River Honddu (Powys)|River Honddu]], which meets the [[River Usk]] near the [[town centre]], a short distance away from the River Tarell which enters the Usk a few hundred metres upstream.\nAfter the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] the original Welsh name of the kingdom in whose territory Brecon stands was (in modern orthography) \"[[Brycheiniog]]\", which was later [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] to Brecknock or Brecon, and probably derives from [[Brychan]], the eponymous founder of the kingdom.\n\nBefore the building of the bridge over the Usk, Brecon was one of the few places where the river could be [[ford (river)|forded]]. In [[Roman Britain]] [[Y Gaer, Brecon]] (''Cicucium'') was established as a Roman cavalry base for the conquest of [[Wales in the Roman Era|Roman Wales]] and Brecon was first established as a military base.\n[[File:A bridge near Brecon.jpeg|thumb|A Bridge near Brecon, 1809]]\n\n===Norman control===\nThe [[confluence]] of the Honddu and the [[River Usk]] made for a valuable defensive position for the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]] which overlooks the town, built by [[Bernard de Neufmarche]] in the late 11th century.<ref name=\"Davies\">Davies (2008).</ref>{{rp |80}} [[Gerald of Wales]] came and made some speeches in 1188 to recruit men to go to the [[Crusades]].\n\n===Town walls===\nBrecon's town walls were constructed by [[Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun]] after 1240.<ref name = \"Pettifer\">Pettifer (2000).</ref>{{rp |8}}  The walls were built of cobble, with four [[gatehouse]]s and was protected by ten semi-circular [[bastion]]s.<ref name = \"Pettifer\" />{{rp |9}}  In 1400 the Welsh prince [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] rose in rebellion against English rule, and in response in 1404 100 [[mark (money)|marks]] was spent by the royal government improving the fortifications to protect Brecon in the event of a Welsh attack. Brecon's walls were largely destroyed during the [[English Civil War]]. Today only fragments survive, including some earthworks and parts of one of the gatehouses; these are protected as [[scheduled monument]]s.<ref name= BreconGatehouse>{{Citation | first = Philip | last = Davis | url = http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/23.html | contribution = Brecon Town Walls | title = Gatehouse | accessdate = 13 October 2011}}.</ref>\n\nIn Shakespeare's play ''[[Richard III (play)|King Richard III]]'', the Duke of Buckingham is suspected of supporting the Welsh pretender Richmond (the future Henry VII), and declares:\n \n<blockquote>''O, let me think on Hastings and be gone<br />To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!''</blockquote>\n\n===Priory and cathedral===\nA Priory was dissolved in 1538, and Brecon's Dominican Friary of St Nicholas was suppressed in August of the same year.<ref name=\"stmichaelsrcbrecon.org.uk\">http://www.stmichaelsrcbrecon.org.uk/?page_id=11667</ref> About {{convert|250|m|yd|abbr=on}} north of the castle stands [[Brecon Cathedral]], a fairly modest building compared to many cathedrals. The role of cathedral is a fairly recent one, and was bestowed upon the church in 1923 with the formation of the [[Diocese of Swansea and Brecon]] from what was previously the [[archdeaconry]] of Brecon \u2014 a part of the [[Diocese of St David's]].\n\n===St. Mary's Church===\n[[St Mary's Church, Brecon|Saint Mary's church]] began as a [[chapel of ease]] to the priory but most of the building is dated to later medieval times.  The West Tower, some {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} high, was built in 1510 by [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Edward, Duke of Buckingham]] at a cost of \u00a32,000.

The first Parish Priest, Maurice Thomas, was installed there by John Blaxton, Archdeacon of Brecon in 1555. The name is derived from the Welsh \u2013 Llandewi yn y Maes \u2013 which translates as St. David's in the Field. It is probable that the site and the name of the present Church were chosen because of the close proximity of a fresh water well called Ffynnon Dewi (David's Well) which was situated approximately 150 metres south of the church.\n\n===Plough Lane Chapel, Lion Street===\n[[Plough Lane Chapel, Brecon|Plough Lane Chapel]], also known as Plough United Reformed Church, is a [[Grade II* listed building]]. The present building dates back to 1841 and was re-modelled by Owen Morris Roberts and is considered to be one of the finest chapel interiors in Wales.\n\n===St Michael's Church===\nAfter the Reformation, some Breconshire families such as the Havards, the Gunters and the Powells persisted with Catholicism despite its suppression. In the 18th Century a Catholic Mass house in Watergate was active, and Rev John Williams was the local Catholic priest from 1788 to 1815. The Watergate house was sold in 1805, becoming the current Watergate Baptist Chapel, and property purchased as the priest's residence and a chapel between Wheat Street and the current St Michael Street, including the \u201cThree Cocks Inn\u201d; about this time Catholic parish records began again. The normal round of bishop's visitations and confirmations resumed in the 1830s. In 1832 most civil liberties were restored to Catholics and they became able to practise their faith more openly. A simple Gothic Church, dedicated to St Michael and designed by [[Charles Hansom]], was built in 1851 at a cost of \u00a31,000.<ref name=\"stmichaelsrcbrecon.org.uk\"/>\n\n==Military town==\nThe east end of town has two military establishments:\n* Dering Lines, home to the [[Infantry Battle School]] (formerly Infantry Training Centre Wales),<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas/brigade_units/gurkha_demonstration_companies/brecon/ | contribution = Brecon | publisher = Army | place = UK | title = Brigade of Gurkhas | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041118175217/http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas/brigade_units/gurkha_demonstration_companies/brecon/ | archivedate = 18 November 2004 | df = dmy-all }}.</ref> where infantry officers and [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]] are trained, and\n* [[The Barracks, Brecon]], home to [[160th (Wales) Brigade]].\n* [[Gurkha]] Company (Mandalay) is based here.\nApproximately {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} to the west of Brecon is [[Sennybridge Training Area (SENTA)|Sennybridge Training Area]], an important training facility for the [[British Army]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.army.mod.uk/5div/organisation/160_wales_brigade/ | contribution = 160the Wales Brigade | publisher = Army | place = UK | title = 5th Division }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>\n[[File:Brecon shopping centre.jpg|left|thumb|The High Street, Brecon]]\n\n==Cattle market==\nThe west end of Brecon has a small industrial area, and recent years have seen the [[cattle]] market moved from the centre of the town to this area, with markets held several times a week.\n\n==Education==\nBrecon has [[primary school]]s, with a [[secondary school]] and [[further education]] college (Brecon Beacons College) on the northern edge of the town.

A plaque on a house wall adjacent to the eastern end of the bridge records that the present bridge was built in 1563 to replace a medieval bridge destroyed by floods in 1535. It was repaired in 1772 and widened in 1794 by Thomas Edwards, the son of [[William Edwards (architect)|William Edwards]] of [[Eglwysilan]]. It had stone parapets until the 1970s when the present deck was superimposed on the old structure. The bridge was painted by [[J.M.W.

Historically it was the [[county town]] of [[Brecknockshire]] (Breconshire); although its role as such was eclipsed with the formation of the County of Powys, it remains an important local centre. Brecon is the third-largest town in Powys, after [[Newtown, Powys|Newtown]] and [[Ystradgynlais]]. It lies north of the [[Brecon Beacons]] mountain range, but is just within the [[Brecon Beacons National Park]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name, Aberhonddu, means \"mouth of the Honddu\". It is derived from the [[River Honddu (Powys)|River Honddu]], which meets the [[River Usk]] near the [[town centre]], a short distance away from the River Tarell which enters the Usk a few hundred metres upstream.\nAfter the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] the original Welsh name of the kingdom in whose territory Brecon stands was (in modern orthography) \"[[Brycheiniog]]\", which was later [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] to Brecknock or Brecon, and probably derives from [[Brychan]], the eponymous founder of the kingdom.\n\nBefore the building of the bridge over the Usk, Brecon was one of the few places where the river could be [[ford (river)|forded]]. In [[Roman Britain]] [[Y Gaer, Brecon]] (''Cicucium'') was established as a Roman cavalry base for the conquest of [[Wales in the Roman Era|Roman Wales]] and Brecon was first established as a military base.\n[[File:A bridge near Brecon.jpeg|thumb|A Bridge near Brecon, 1809]]\n\n===Norman control===\nThe [[confluence]] of the Honddu and the [[River Usk]] made for a valuable defensive position for the [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]] which overlooks the town, built by [[Bernard de Neufmarche]] in the late 11th century.<ref name=\"Davies\">Davies (2008).</ref>{{rp |80}} [[Gerald of Wales]] came and made some speeches in 1188 to recruit men to go to the [[Crusades]].\n\n===Town walls===\nBrecon's town walls were constructed by [[Humphrey de Bohun, 2nd Earl of Hereford|Humphrey de Bohun]] after 1240.<ref name = \"Pettifer\">Pettifer (2000).</ref>{{rp |8}}  The walls were built of cobble, with four [[gatehouse]]s and was protected by ten semi-circular [[bastion]]s.<ref name = \"Pettifer\" />{{rp |9}}  In 1400 the Welsh prince [[Owain Glynd\u0175r]] rose in rebellion against English rule, and in response in 1404 100 [[mark (money)|marks]] was spent by the royal government improving the fortifications to protect Brecon in the event of a Welsh attack. Brecon's walls were largely destroyed during the [[English Civil War]]. Today only fragments survive, including some earthworks and parts of one of the gatehouses; these are protected as [[scheduled monument]]s.<ref name= BreconGatehouse>{{Citation | first = Philip | last = Davis | url = http://www.gatehouse-gazetteer.info/Welshsites/23.html | contribution = Brecon Town Walls | title = Gatehouse | accessdate = 13 October 2011}}.</ref>\n\nIn Shakespeare's play ''[[Richard III (play)|King Richard III]]'', the Duke of Buckingham is suspected of supporting the Welsh pretender Richmond (the future Henry VII), and declares:\n \n<blockquote>''O, let me think on Hastings and be gone<br />To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!''</blockquote>\n\n===Priory and cathedral===\nA Priory was dissolved in 1538, and Brecon's Dominican Friary of St Nicholas was suppressed in August of the same year.<ref name=\"stmichaelsrcbrecon.org.uk\">http://www.stmichaelsrcbrecon.org.uk/?page_id=11667</ref> About {{convert|250|m|yd|abbr=on}} north of the castle stands [[Brecon Cathedral]], a fairly modest building compared to many cathedrals. The role of cathedral is a fairly recent one, and was bestowed upon the church in 1923 with the formation of the [[Diocese of Swansea and Brecon]] from what was previously the [[archdeaconry]] of Brecon \u2014 a part of the [[Diocese of St David's]].\n\n===St. Mary's Church===\n[[St Mary's Church, Brecon|Saint Mary's church]] began as a [[chapel of ease]] to the priory but most of the building is dated to later medieval times.  The West Tower, some {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} high, was built in 1510 by [[Edward Stafford, 3rd Duke of Buckingham|Edward, Duke of Buckingham]] at a cost of \u00a32,000.

In March 2007 the bells were removed from the church tower for refurbishment.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.walesdirectory.co.uk/tourist-attractions/Churches_and_Chapels/Wales11615.htm | contribution = St Mary's Church in Wales | title = Wales Directory | place = UK}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stmarysbrecon.org.uk/|title=St Mary's Church Brecon|website=www.stmarysbrecon.org.uk}}</ref> The church is a Grade II* [[listed building]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/wa-7015-church-of-st-mary-brecon|title=Church of St Mary, Brecon, Powys|first=Good|last=Stuff|website=www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===St. David's Church, Llanfaes===\nThe [[St. David's Church, Llanfaes|Church of St. David]], referred to locally as Llanfaes Church, was probably founded in the early sixteenth century. The first Parish Priest, Maurice Thomas, was installed there by John Blaxton, Archdeacon of Brecon in 1555. The name is derived from the Welsh \u2013 Llandewi yn y Maes \u2013 which translates as St. David's in the Field. It is probable that the site and the name of the present Church were chosen because of the close proximity of a fresh water well called Ffynnon Dewi (David's Well) which was situated approximately 150 metres south of the church.\n\n===Plough Lane Chapel, Lion Street===\n[[Plough Lane Chapel, Brecon|Plough Lane Chapel]], also known as Plough United Reformed Church, is a [[Grade II* listed building]]. The present building dates back to 1841 and was re-modelled by Owen Morris Roberts and is considered to be one of the finest chapel interiors in Wales.\n\n===St Michael's Church===\nAfter the Reformation, some Breconshire families such as the Havards, the Gunters and the Powells persisted with Catholicism despite its suppression. In the 18th Century a Catholic Mass house in Watergate was active, and Rev John Williams was the local Catholic priest from 1788 to 1815. The Watergate house was sold in 1805, becoming the current Watergate Baptist Chapel, and property purchased as the priest's residence and a chapel between Wheat Street and the current St Michael Street, including the \u201cThree Cocks Inn\u201d; about this time Catholic parish records began again. The normal round of bishop's visitations and confirmations resumed in the 1830s. In 1832 most civil liberties were restored to Catholics and they became able to practise their faith more openly. A simple Gothic Church, dedicated to St Michael and designed by [[Charles Hansom]], was built in 1851 at a cost of \u00a31,000.<ref name=\"stmichaelsrcbrecon.org.uk\"/>\n\n==Military town==\nThe east end of town has two military establishments:\n* Dering Lines, home to the [[Infantry Battle School]] (formerly Infantry Training Centre Wales),<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas/brigade_units/gurkha_demonstration_companies/brecon/ | contribution = Brecon | publisher = Army | place = UK | title = Brigade of Gurkhas | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041118175217/http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas/brigade_units/gurkha_demonstration_companies/brecon/ | archivedate = 18 November 2004 | df = dmy-all }}.</ref> where infantry officers and [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]] are trained, and\n* [[The Barracks, Brecon]], home to [[160th (Wales) Brigade]].\n* [[Gurkha]] Company (Mandalay) is based here.\nApproximately {{convert|9|mi|km|0}} to the west of Brecon is [[Sennybridge Training Area (SENTA)|Sennybridge Training Area]], an important training facility for the [[British Army]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.army.mod.uk/5div/organisation/160_wales_brigade/ | contribution = 160the Wales Brigade | publisher = Army | place = UK | title = 5th Division }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.</ref>\n[[File:Brecon shopping centre.jpg|left|thumb|The High Street, Brecon]]\n\n==Cattle market==\nThe west end of Brecon has a small industrial area, and recent years have seen the [[cattle]] market moved from the centre of the town to this area, with markets held several times a week.\n\n==Education==\nBrecon has [[primary school]]s, with a [[secondary school]] and [[further education]] college (Brecon Beacons College) on the northern edge of the town.

A plaque on a house wall adjacent to the eastern end of the bridge records that the present bridge was built in 1563 to replace a medieval bridge destroyed by floods in 1535. It was repaired in 1772 and widened in 1794 by Thomas Edwards, the son of [[William Edwards (architect)|William Edwards]] of [[Eglwysilan]]. It had stone parapets until the 1970s when the present deck was superimposed on the old structure. The bridge was painted by [[J.M.W.

The efforts to make Hindi the pre-eminent language were bitterly resisted by the members from those parts of India where Hindi was not spoken natively.\n\nEventually, a compromise was reached not to include any mention to a national language. Instead, [[Hindi]] in [[Devanagari]] script was declared to be the [[official language]] of the union, but for \"fifteen years from the commencement of the Constitution, the English Language shall continue to be used for all the official purposes of the Union for which it was being used immediately before such commencement\".<ref name=\"Guha2011\"/>\n\nArticle 343 (1) of the [[Constitution of India]] states \"The Official Language of the Union government shall be Hindi in Devanagari script.\"<ref name=cons/>{{rp|212}}<ref name=\"Benedikter2009\">{{cite book|author=Thomas Benedikter|title=Language Policy and Linguistic Minorities in India: An Appraisal of the Linguistic Rights of Minorities in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vpZv2GHM7VQC&pg=PA32|accessdate=19 December 2014|year=2009|publisher=LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|isbn=978-3-643-10231-7|pages=32\u201335}}</ref> Unless Parliament decided otherwise, the use of [[English language|English]] for official purposes was to cease 15 years after the constitution came into effect, i.e. on 26 January 1965.<ref name=cons/>{{rp|212}}<ref name=\"Benedikter2009\"/>\n\n{{Main|Hindi language}}\n{{main|Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu}}\n\nAs the date for changeover approached, however, there was much alarm in the non Hindi-speaking areas of India, especially in [[Kerala]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[West Bengal]], [[Karnataka]], [[Puducherry]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]].

However, [[tropical cyclogenesis]] is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by the formation of Subtropical Storm Andrea on May 20, marking the record fifth year in a row where a tropical or subtropical cyclone developed before the official start of the season, breaking the previous record of four consecutive years set in 1951\u20131954.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Klotzbach, Philip |user=philklotzbach |number=1130594068851900418 |title=The Atlantic has now had named storms form prior to 1 June in five consecutive years: 2015\u20132019.

These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of [[University College London]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and [[Colorado State University]] (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the state of the [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO). On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, with an [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy|accumulated cyclone

The low moved eastward over the western Atlantic during the next day as a large area of cloudiness and showers developed to its east, and on May 19, it began to interact with low-level vorticity along the western edge of a dissipating [[cold front]]. The two systems had coalesced into a broad area of low pressure by 12:00 UTC on May 20, and convection associated with the low became better organized throughout that day as the system moved northward. By 22:00 UTC, an [[53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron|Air Force reconnaissance]] flight found that the system had acquired a well-defined center of circulation, and was producing gale-force winds well away from the center. Based on the aircraft data and the structure of the system, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the system became Subtropical Storm Andrea at 18:00 UTC on May 20. However, the cyclone soon began to [[Entrainment (meteorology)|entrain]] dry air into its circulation while southwesterly wind shear increased, resulting in a rapid waning of the convection. By 12:00 UTC on May 21, Andrea's convection had dissipated, and the cyclone degenerated into a remnant low.

The wave moved westward across the eastern tropical Atlantic during the next few days, spawning an elongated area of low pressure within the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] on September 15. As the wave continued westward, the area of low pressure moved slowly west-northwestward and gradually became better defined. By 06:00 UTC on September 17, the low had acquired a well-defined center and sufficient convective organization to be classified as a tropical depression. Initially slow to strengthen due to moderate northerly wind shear, the convection became better organized early on September 18, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry at 06:00 UTC that day. Afterward, Jerry steadily strengthened while over warm waters and a favorable atmospheric environment. On September 19, Jerry began a period of [[rapid intensification]], reaching hurricane strength at 12:00 UTC that day and attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) twelve hours later. Shortly thereafter, strong upper-level winds and dry mid-level air caused Jerry to rapidly weaken while it moved quickly west-northwestward under a strong deep-layer [[Ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over the central Atlantic. Jerry weakened to a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on September 21 as it turned northwestward around the western periphery of the ridge. The cyclone maintained an intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) during the next couple of days as northwesterly shear persisted. A mid-level trough associated with [[Hurricane Humberto (2019)|Hurricane Humberto]] created a weakness in the ridge, causing Jerry to turn north-northeastward on September 22. By September 23, Jerry finally began to weaken as it resumed its north-northwestward to westward motion. By 18:00 UTC on September 24, deep convection had dissipated, and Jerry became a gale force post-tropical cyclone while it was located 280 mi (450 km) west-southwest of [[Bermuda]]. The post-tropical cyclone continued to gradually weaken, with winds decreasing below gale force on September 25 as it passed near Bermuda.

The season officially began on June 1 and ended on November 30. These dates historically describe the period each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin and are adopted by convention. However, [[tropical cyclogenesis]] is possible at any time of the year, as demonstrated by the formation of Subtropical Storm Andrea on May 20, marking the record fifth year in a row where a tropical or subtropical cyclone developed before the official start of the season, breaking the previous record of four consecutive years set in 1951\u20131954.<ref>{{cite tweet |author=Klotzbach, Philip |user=philklotzbach |number=1130594068851900418 |title=The Atlantic has now had named storms form prior to 1 June in five consecutive years: 2015\u20132019.

After five weeks of inactivity, the tropics began to ramp up in late August with a few storms developing, including [[Hurricane Dorian]], which struck the [[Windward Islands]] and [[United States Virgin Islands]] as a strengthening tropical cyclone and then rapidly intensified into a Category 5 hurricane on approach to [[the Bahamas]], where it devastated the northwesternmost islands before proceeding up the Eastern Seaboard, where it also caused considerable damage.\n\nIn September, [[Tropical Storm Fernand (2019)|Tropical Storm Fernand]] quickly formed near the Mexican coast and proceeded to make landfall in Tamaulipas, Mexico, causing severe flash flooding across the state. [[Hurricane Humberto (2019)|Hurricane Humberto]] brought heavy rains and hurricane-force winds to [[Bermuda]] for the first time since [[Hurricane Nicole (2016)|Hurricane Nicole]] in 2016. [[Tropical Storm Imelda]] quickly formed over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] before it made [[landfall]] in [[Texas]], causing catastrophic flooding as it slowed to a crawl over the state. [[Hurricane Lorenzo (2019)|Lorenzo]] became the easternmost Category 5 Atlantic hurricane on record, and the French ship ''Bourbon Rhode'' sank after sailing through it. Additionally, [[Tropical Storm Nestor (2019)|Tropical Storm Nestor]] caused a tornado outbreak across west Florida in mid-October, causing moderate damage to the area affected by [[Hurricane Michael]] the previous year. [[Tropical Storm Olga (2019)|Tropical Storm Olga]] also caused moderate damage and heavy flooding over the Western [[Gulf Coast]]. Hurricane Pablo became the easternmost hurricane formation on record, besting [[Hurricane Vince]]. The season concluded with Tropical Storm Sebastien, a persistent November cyclone. Since [[Hurricane Dorian|Dorian]] and [[Hurricane Lorenzo (2019)|Lorenzo]] both became Category 5 hurricanes, 2019 became the fourth consecutive season to feature at least one Category 5 hurricane ([[Hurricane Matthew|Matthew]] in 2016; [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]] and [[Hurricane Maria|Maria]] in 2017 and [[Hurricane Michael|Michael]] in 2018).

These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of [[University College London]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) and [[Colorado State University]] (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the state of the [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] (ENSO). On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes, with an [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy|accumulated cyclone

The low moved eastward over the western Atlantic during the next day as a large area of cloudiness and showers developed to its east, and on May 19, it began to interact with low-level vorticity along the western edge of a dissipating [[cold front]]. The two systems had coalesced into a broad area of low pressure by 12:00 UTC on May 20, and convection associated with the low became better organized throughout that day as the system moved northward. By 22:00 UTC, an [[53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron|Air Force reconnaissance]] flight found that the system had acquired a well-defined center of circulation, and was producing gale-force winds well away from the center. Based on the aircraft data and the structure of the system, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated that the system became Subtropical Storm Andrea at 18:00 UTC on May 20. However, the cyclone soon began to [[Entrainment (meteorology)|entrain]] dry air into its circulation while southwesterly wind shear increased, resulting in a rapid waning of the convection.

Barry's convective structure remained asymmetrical, with nearly all of the convection location south of the circulation due to wind shear and dry air. Around 12:00&nbsp;UTC on July&nbsp;13, Barry intensified into a hurricane and peaked with winds of 75&nbsp;mph (120&nbsp;km/h). Three hours later, Barry made landfall near [[Intracoastal City, Louisiana|Intracoastal City]], [[Louisiana]].

Fernand also dumped heavy rainfall over [[South Texas]]. In preparation for the storm, the Mexican government activated [[Plan DN-III-E]], sending 4,000 troops to the northeastern states to assist in disaster relief. In Nuevo Le\u00f3n, schools and public transport lines were closed on September 5 but resumed operations the next day. Of the states, Nuevo Le\u00f3n was the hardest hit, suffering at least [[Mexican peso|MX$]]4.2&nbsp;billion (US$213&nbsp;million) in damage. In some places, six months of rain fell in six hours.

The nascent cyclone tracked northwest in an environment of moderate southwesterly wind shear and dry mid-level air, but it nonetheless intensified into Tropical Storm Gabrielle six hours after genesis. Interaction with an upper-level low further compounded negative environmental factors, causing the system to lose a majority of its convection for nearly a day. As the steering regime transitioned to be dictated by a break in the subtropical ridge, Gabrielle curved west-northwest and then north. A decrease in upper-level winds led to the formation of a well-defined inner core, and Gabrielle attained peak winds of 65&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) on September&nbsp;8. Thereafter, the influence of mid-latitude westerlies caused the cyclone to turn northeast and begin extratropical transition, a process it completed by 12:00&nbsp;UTC on September&nbsp;10 well northwest of the Azores.

The wave moved westward across the eastern tropical Atlantic during the next few days, spawning an elongated area of low pressure within the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] on September 15. As the wave continued westward, the area of low pressure moved slowly west-northwestward and gradually became better defined. By 06:00 UTC on September 17, the low had acquired a well-defined center and sufficient convective organization to be classified as a tropical depression. Initially slow to strengthen due to moderate northerly wind shear, the convection became better organized early on September 18, and the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Jerry at 06:00 UTC that day. Afterward, Jerry steadily strengthened while over warm waters and a favorable atmospheric environment. On September 19, Jerry began a period of [[rapid intensification]], reaching hurricane strength at 12:00 UTC that day and attaining its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) twelve hours later. Shortly thereafter, strong upper-level winds and dry mid-level air caused Jerry to rapidly weaken while it moved quickly west-northwestward under a strong deep-layer [[Ridge (meteorology)|ridge]] over the central Atlantic. Jerry weakened to a tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on September 21 as it turned northwestward around the western periphery of the ridge. The cyclone maintained an intensity of 65 mph (100 km/h) during the next couple of days as northwesterly shear persisted. A mid-level trough associated with [[Hurricane Humberto (2019)|Hurricane Humberto]] created a weakness in the ridge, causing Jerry to turn north-northeastward on September 22. By September 23, Jerry finally began to weaken as it resumed its north-northwestward to westward motion. By 18:00 UTC on September 24, deep convection had dissipated, and Jerry became a gale force post-tropical cyclone while it was located 280 mi (450 km) west-southwest of [[Bermuda]]. The post-tropical cyclone continued to gradually weaken, with winds decreasing below gale force on September 25 as it passed near Bermuda.

Moving eastwards, the cyclone quickly gained hurricane-force winds, before weakening as it turned north and west in a large counterclockwise loop, making another smaller loop on its way. On October&nbsp;29, a smaller low-pressure area formed near the center of the original extratropical cyclone, possessing a small wind field more characteristic of a tropical cyclone. Deep convection formed around the center of the new low on October&nbsp;30 due to increased [[atmospheric instability]] despite sea surface temperatures of only {{convert|21|C|abbr=on|order=flip}}. This led to the designation of Subtropical Storm Rebekah by the NHC at 12:00&nbsp;UTC. The system was designated as a subtropical storm due to a lack of both separation with the parent [[Upper-level low]] and significant outflow, which are common characteristic of tropical cyclones. At this time, Rebekah possessed sustained winds of 50&nbsp;mph (85&nbsp;km/h), representing the system's peak intensity. On October&nbsp;31, Rebekah turned to the east then east-northeast, entering a region of low relative humidity, increasing wind shear, and even colder sea surface temperatures. The system rapidly weakened as a result of these unfavorable environmental factors.

The system, initially moving west-northwest, curved toward the east-northeast ahead of an approaching upper-level trough. At the same time, Sebastian gradually intensified despite an impinging cold front and moderate wind shear. The cyclone attained peak winds of 70&nbsp;mph (110&nbsp;km/h) early on November&nbsp;23, when it exhibited a mid-level eye feature. Significantly colder waters and strong shear soon took their toll on Sebastian, causing it to become an extratropical cyclone by 00:00&nbsp;UTC on November&nbsp;25.

{"title_page": "Snorkeling", "text_new": "{{short description|Swimming while breathing through a snorkel}}\n[[File:Reef snorkeler.jpg|thumb|A snorkeler amid [[coral]]s on a [[coral reef]] near [[Fiji]]]]\n\n'''Snorkeling''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#Doubled in British English|British and Commonwealth English spelling]]: '''snorkelling''') is the practice of [[human swimming|swimming]] on or through a body of water while equipped with a [[diving mask]], a shaped breathing tube called a snorkel, and usually [[swimfins]]. In cooler waters, a [[wetsuit]] may also be worn. Use of this equipment allows the snorkeler to observe underwater attractions for extended periods  with relatively little effort and to breathe while face-down at the surface.\n\nSnorkeling is a popular [[recreation]]al activity, particularly at [[tropics|tropical]] [[resort]] locations. The primary appeal is the opportunity to observe [[marine biology#Lifeforms|underwater life]] in a natural setting without the complicated equipment and training required for [[scuba diving]]. It appeals to all ages because of how little effort there is, and without the exhaled bubbles of scuba-diving equipment. It is the basis of the two surface disciplines of the  [[underwater sports|underwater sport]] of [[finswimming]].<ref name=finswimmimg />\n\nSnorkeling is also used by scuba divers when on the surface, in underwater sports such as [[underwater hockey]] and [[underwater rugby]], and as part of water-based searches conducted by [[search and rescue]] teams.\n==Equipment==\nEssential equipment includes the [[Snorkel (swimming)|snorkel]] for breathing, and a [[diving mask]] or [[swimming goggles]] for vision. [[Swimfin]]s for more efficient propulsion are common. Environmental protection against cold, sunburn and marine stings and scratches is also regionally popular, and may be in the form of a [[wetsuit]], [[diving skins]], or [[rash vest]]. Some snorkellers rely on waterproof [[sunscreen]] lotions, but some of these are environmentally damaging. If necessary the snorkeller may wear a [[weightbelt]] to facilitate [[freediving]], or an inflatable snorkelling vest, a form of [[buoyancy aid]], for safety.\n\n=== Snorkel ===\n{{main|Snorkel (swimming)}}\n[[File:Vieques underwater a.jpg|thumb|Adult's snorkel]]\n[[File:Tuba enfant.jpg|thumb|Child's snorkel]]\nA snorkel is a device used for breathing air from above the surface when the wearer's head is face downwards in the water with the mouth and the nose submerged. It may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving [[diving mask|mask]]. The integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling, while the separate device may also be used for [[underwater sports|underwater activities]] such as [[spearfishing]], [[freediving]], [[finswimming]], [[underwater hockey]], [[underwater rugby]] and for surface breathing with [[scuba equipment]]. A swimmer's snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter \"L\" or \"J\", fitted with a [[mouthpiece (scuba)|mouthpiece]] at the lower end and constructed of light metal, [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. The snorkel may come with a [[rubber]] loop or a plastic clip enabling the snorkel to be attached to the outside of the head strap of the [[diving mask]]. Although the snorkel may also be secured by tucking the tube between the mask-strap and the head, this alternative strategy can lead to physical discomfort, mask leakage or even snorkel loss.<ref>Steve Blount and Herb Taylor, ''The Joy of Snorkeling'', New York, NY: Pisces Book Company, 1984, p. 21.</ref>\n\nSnorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply and slowly, as this reduces the dead space ratio and [[work of breathing]].\n\n[[File:Snorkel shapes.jpg|thumb|Basic snorkel shapes]]\nSnorkels come in two orientations: Front-mounted and side-mounted. The first snorkel to be patented in 1938 was front-mounted, worn with the tube over the front of the face and secured with a bracket to the diving mask. Front-mounted snorkels proved popular in European snorkeling until the late 1950s, when side-mounted snorkels came into the ascendancy. Front-mounted snorkels experienced a comeback a decade later as a piece of competitive swimming equipment to be used in pool workouts and in finswimming races, where they outperform side-mounted snorkels in streamlining.\n\n==== Plain snorkel ====\nA plain snorkel consists essentially of a tube with a mouthpiece to be inserted between the lips.\n[[File:Snorkel attachment methods.jpg|thumb|Snorkel attachment methods]]\n[[File:Snorkel mouthpieces.jpg|thumb|Snorkel mouthpieces]]\nThe barrel is the hollow tube leading from the supply end at the top of the snorkel to the mouthpiece at the bottom. The barrel is made of a relatively rigid material such as plastic, light metal or hard rubber. The bore is the interior chamber of the barrel; bore length, diameter and bends all affect breathing resistance.\n\nThe top of the barrel may be open to the elements or fitted with a valve designed to shut off the air supply from the atmosphere when the top is submerged. There may be a high visibility band around the top to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. The simplest way of attaching the snorkel to the head is to slip the top of the barrel between the mask strap and the head. This may cause the mask to leak, however, and alternative means of attachment of the barrel to the head include threading the mask strap a moulded on the barrel, using a figure-8 rubber snorkel keeper pulled down over the barrel, or a rotatable plastic snorkel keeper clipped to the barrel\n\nThe mouthpiece helps to keep the snorkel in the mouth. It is made of soft and flexible material, originally natural rubber and more recently silicone or [[PVC]]. The commonest of the multiple designs available<ref>P. P. Serebrenitsky: ''\u0422\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430'', Lenizdat, 1969, p. 92.

A tight grip with the teeth can also cause jaw fatigue and pain.\n\n====Full-face snorkel mask====\n[[File:Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask.jpg|thumb|Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask]]\nAn integrated snorkel consists essentially of a tube topped with a shut-off valve and opening at the bottom into the interior of a diving mask. Integrated snorkels must be fitted with valves to shut off the snorkel's air inlet when submerged. Water will otherwise pour into the opening at the top and flood the interior of the mask. Snorkels are attached to sockets on the top or the sides of the mask.\n\nNew-generation snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, the nose and the mouth. They enable surface snorkellers to breathe nasally or orally and may be a workaround in the case of surface snorkellers who [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag]] in response to the presence of standard snorkel mouthpieces in their mouths. Some early snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, while others exclude the mouth, covering the eyes and the nose only. The 1950s [[US Divers]] \"Marino\" hybrid comprised a single snorkel mask with eye and nose coverage and a separate snorkel for the mouth.<ref>''Early Mfg. & Retailers - US Divers No.43''. Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/u/US_Divers/43.html.</ref>\n\nFull face snorkel masks use an integral snorkel with separate channels for intake and exhaled gases theoretically ensuring the user is always breathing untainted fresh air whatever the respiratory effort. Built-in dry top snorkel system. In addition to a standard ball float system that stops the water from entering the tube when submerged, full-face masks are designed in such a way that even if a small amount of water does get into the snorkel, it will be channeled away from the face and into the chin area of the mask. A special valve located on the bottom of the chin allows to drain the water out. The main problem is that it must fit the whole face well enough to make a reliable seal and since no two faces are the same shape, it may not seal adequately on any specific user. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing.{{Clarify|reason=can these masks  not be cleared in place?|date=September 2019}} Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below, since the mask covers the nose with a rigid plastic structure, which makes it impossible to pinch the nose if needed to equalise pressure at greater depth. Trained scuba divers are likely to avoid such devices<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dipndive.com/blog/full-face-snorkeling-masks-pros-and-cons.html|title=Full-Face Snorkeling Masks: Pros And Cons|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}</ref> however snorkel masks are a boon for those with medical conditions that preclude taking part in scuba diving.{{cn|date=February 2019}}{{clarify|reason=how, specifically, are snorkel masks a \"boon\" for these people?|date=February 2019}}\n\nAs a result of a short period with an unusually high number of snorkeling deaths in Hawaii<ref>https://www.letsgotomaui.net/da-kine/full-face-snorkel-mask-dangers/</ref> there is some suspicion that the design of the masks can result in buildup of excess CO<sub>2</sub>. It is far from certain that the masks are at fault, but the state of Hawaii has begun to track the equipment being used in cases of snorkeling fatalities. Besides the possibility that the masks, or at least some brands of the mask, are a cause, other theories include the possibility that the masks make snorkeling accessible to people who have difficulty with traditional snorkeling equipment. That ease of access may result in more snorkelers who lack experience or have underlying medical conditions, possibly exacerbating problems that are unrelated to the type of equipment being used.<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-full-face-snorkel-mask-related-deaths/</ref>\n\nDuring the current [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic related shortages]], full-face snorkel masks have been adapted into oxygen dispensing emergency respiratory masks by using [[3D printing]] and minimal modifications to the original mask.<ref>[http://www.leparisien.fr/societe/coronavirus-quand-les-inventeurs-viennent-a-la-rescousse-des-hopitaux-23-03-2020-8286186.php Opoczynski, David (23 March 2020). \"Coronavirus : quand les inventeurs viennent \u00e0 la rescousse des h\u00f4pitaux\". leparisien.fr].

By creating an airspace, the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater. All scuba diving masks consist of the lenses also known as a faceplate, a soft rubber skirt, which encloses the nose and seals against the face, and a head strap to hold it in place. There are different styles and shapes. These range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials; common choices are silicone and rubber. A snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmer's goggles which do not enclose the nose.\n\n===Swimfins===\n{{Main|Swimfin}}\nSwimfins, fins or flippers are [[fin]]like accessories worn on the feet,<ref name=\"AlainPerrier\" />  and usually made from [[rubber]] or [[plastic]], to aid movement through the water in [[Water sport (recreation)|water sports]] activities. Swimfins help the wearer to move through [[water]] more efficiently, as [[Foot|human feet]] are too small and inappropriately shaped to provide much [[thrust]], especially when the wearer is carrying equipment that increases [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic]] [[Drag (physics)|drag]].<ref name=\"pendergast2003\">{{cite journal |last1=Pendergast |first1=DR |last2=Mollendorf |first2=J |last3=Logue |first3=C |last4=Samimy |first4=S |title=Evaluation of fins used in underwater swimming |journal=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medicine |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=57\u201373 |year=2003 |publisher=Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society |pmid=12841609 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/3936 |accessdate=11 February 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid15796314\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pendergast D, Mollendorf J, Zamparo P, Termin A, Bushnell D, Paschke D |title=The influence of drag on human locomotion in water |journal=Undersea Hyperb Med |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=45\u201357 |year=2005 |pmid=15796314 |doi= |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/4037 |accessdate=2008-08-25}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid9148086\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pendergast DR, Tedesco M, Nawrocki DM, Fisher NM |title=Energetics of underwater swimming with SCUBA |journal=Med Sci Sports Exerc |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=573\u201380 |date=May 1996 |pmid=9148086 |doi= 10.1097/00005768-199605000-00006}}</ref> Very long fins and [[monofin]]s used by freedivers as a means of underwater propulsion do not require high-[[frequency]] leg movement. This improves efficiency and helps to minimize oxygen consumption. Short, stiff-bladed fins are effective for short bursts of acceleration and maneuvering.\n\n===Exposure protection===\n{{see also|Wetsuit|Dive skins|Rash guard}}\nA [[wetsuit]] is a garment, usually made of foamed neoprene with a knit fabric facing, which is worn by people engaged in water sports and other activities in or on water, primarily providing thermal insulation, but also buoyancy and protection from abrasion, ultraviolet exposure and stings from marine organisms. The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water. The thickness, fit and coverage of the suit are important factors for insulation.\n\n[[Diving suit#Dive skins|Dive skins]] are used when diving in water temperatures above {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. They are usually one piece full length garments made from [[spandex|spandex or Lycra]] and provide little thermal protection, but do protect the skin from [[jellyfish]] stings, abrasion and [[sunburn]]. This kind of suit is also known as a 'Stinger Suit'. Some divers wear a dive skin under a wetsuit, which allows easier donning and (for those who experience skin problems from neoprene) provides additional comfort.<ref name=\"EcoStinger 2014\" />\n\nA [[rash guard]], also known as rash vest or rashie, is an athletic shirt made of spandex and nylon or polyester. The name rash guard reflects the fact that the shirt protects the wearer against rashes caused by abrasion, or by sunburn from extended exposure to the sun. These shirts can be worn by themselves, or under a wetsuit. A rash guard by itself is used for light coverage in warm to extreme summer temperatures for several watersports including snorkeling. There are also lower body rash guards, which are similar to compression shorts to be worn under the surfers' boardshorts.\n\n===Weight belt===\n{{See also|Diver weighting system#Weight belt}}\n[[File:Zavorra.JPG|thumb|Typical weight belt ]]\nWeight belts are the most common weighting system currently in use for snorkeling.<ref>[http://ygraine.membrane.com/enterhtml/live/scuba/products.html Scuba diving air Regulators, buoyancy compensators scuba diving equipment, information advice help with scuba gear products safety - Philadelphia Area Dive Shops<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621090205/http://ygraine.membrane.com/enterhtml/live/scuba/products.html |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref> They are generally made of tough [[nylon]] webbing, but other materials such as [[rubber]] can be used. Weight belts for snorkeling are generally fitted with a quick release buckle to allow the dumping of weight rapidly in an emergency.\n\nThe most common design of weight used with a belt is rectangular [[lead]] blocks with two slots in them threaded onto the belt. These blocks can be coated in [[plastic]], which increases corrosion resistance. The plastic coated weights may be marketed as being less abrasive to [[wetsuits]]. The weights may be constrained from sliding along the webbing by metal or plastic [[Glossary of underwater diving terminology#belt slide|belt sliders]]. Another popular style has a single slot through which the belt can be threaded. These are sometimes locked in position by squeezing the weight to grip the webbing, but this makes them difficult to remove when less weight is needed. There are also weight designs which may be added to the belt by clipping on when needed. The amount of weight needed depends mainly on the buoyancy of the wet suit.\n\n===Snorkeling vest===\nAn inflatable [[Personal flotation device|personal buoyancy aid]] designed for surface swimming applications. In shape, often like a horse-collar [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy compensator]], or [[airline]] [[life jacket]], but only with oral inflation or a CO<sub>2</sub> cartridge for emergencies.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe simplest type of snorkel is a plain tube that is allowed to flood when [[underwater]]. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (''blast clearing'') or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (''displacement method'') and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath. The displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.<ref>Underwater World, ''Unit 3- Diving Skills''. Retrieved on 28 February 2019 at https://www.diveunderwaterworld.com/s/Chapter-3-Diving-Skills.pdf.</ref>\n\nExperienced users tend to develop a surface breathing style which minimises work of breathing, carbon dioxide buildup and risk of water inspiration, while optimising water removal. This involves a sharp puff in the early stage of exhalation, which is effective for clearing the tube of remaining water, and a fairly large but comfortable exhaled volume, mostly fairly slowly for low work of breathing, followed by an immediate slow inhalation, which reduces entrainment of any residual water, to a comfortable but relatively large inhaled volume, repeated without delay. Elastic recoil is used to assist with the initial puff, which can be made sharper by controlling the start of exhalation with the tongue. This technique is most applicable to relaxed cruising on the surface. Racing finswimmers may use a different technique as they need a far greater level of ventilation when working hard. \n\nSome snorkels have a [[sump]] at the lowest point to allow a small volume of water to remain in the snorkel without being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes. Some also have a [[non-return valve]] in the sump, to drain water in the tube when the diver exhales. The water is pushed out through the valve when the tube is blocked by water and the exhalation pressure exceeds the water pressure on the outside of the valve. This is almost exactly the mechanism of blast clearing which does not require the valve, but the pressure required is marginally less, and effective blast clearing requires a higher flow rate. The full face mask has a double airflow valve which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth.<ref>Snorkel Ken, \"Full Face Snorkel Mask Reviews | Tribord EasyBreathe Alternatives and Best Prices\". Retrieved on 3 March 2019 at https://snorkelstore.net/full-face-snorkel-mask-review-lower-price-lower-quality/.</ref> A few models of snorkel have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of any water that splashes over the top end of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water.<ref>US patent 5,404,872, ''Splash-guard for snorkel tubes'', April 11, 1995. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/01/fe/9a/6038e50865f3f1/US5404872.pdf.</ref>\n\nFinswimmers do not normally use snorkels with a sump valve, as they learn to blast clear the tube on most if not all exhalations, which keeps the water content in the tube to a minimum as the tube can be shaped for lower work of breathing, and elimination of water traps, allowing greater speed and lowering the stress of eventual swallowing of small quantities of water, which would impede their competition performance.<ref>''Finswimming snorkels''. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://monofin.co.uk/blog-snorkels.html</ref>\n\nA common problem with all mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used, or if stored for long periods, or through environmental fouling, or owing to lack of maintenance. Many also either slightly increase the flow resistance of the snorkel, or provide a small water trap, which retains a little water in the tube after clearing.<ref>''Snorkel Care''. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/care-snorkel.htm.</ref>\n\nModern designs use [[silicone rubber]] in the mouthpiece and one-way clearing and float valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life. [[Natural rubber]] was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small \"[[ping pong]]\" balls in a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous. Similarly, [[diving mask]]s with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organizations such as PADI, BSAC because they can engender a false sense of security and can be difficult to clear if flooded.\n\nA snorkel may be either separate or integrated into a swim or dive [[diving mask|mask]]. Usage of the term \"snorkel\" in this section excludes devices integrated with, and opening into, swimmers' or divers' masks. A separate snorkel typically comprises a tube for breathing and a means of attaching the tube to the head of the wearer. The tube has an opening at the top and a mouthpiece at the bottom. Some tubes are topped with a valve to prevent water from entering the tube when it is [[Underwater|submerged]].\n\nThe total length, inner diameter and/or inner volume of a snorkel tube are matters of utmost importance because they affect the user's ability to breathe normally while swimming or floating head downwards on the surface of the water. These dimensions also have implications for the user's ability to blow residual water out of the tube when surfacing. An overlong snorkel tube may cause breathing resistance, while an overwide tube may prove hard to clear of water. A high-volume tube is liable to encourage a build-up of stale air, including exhaled carbon dioxide, because it constitutes respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]].\n\n==Practice of snorkeling ==\n[[File:Sea Garden of BUNAKEN.jpg|thumb|Snorkeler with mask and snorkel]]\nSnorkeling is an activity in its own right, as well as an adjunct to other activities, such as breath-hold diving, [[spearfishing]] and [[scuba diving]],<ref name=\"NOAA Diving Manual 1979\" /> and several competitive [[underwater sports]], such as [[underwater hockey]] and [[finswimming]]. In all cases, the use of a snorkel facilitates breathing while swimming at the surface and observing what is going on under the water.\n\nBeing non-competitive, snorkeling is considered more a leisure activity than a [[sport]].<ref name=\"Jennings2007\">{{cite book|author=Gayle Jennings|title=Water-Based Tourism, Sport, Leisure, and Recreation Experiences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBAGX5l5uuwC&pg=PA130|date=2 April 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-34928-7|pages=130\u2013}}</ref> Snorkeling requires no special training, only the very basic swimming abilities and being able to breathe through the snorkel.<ref name=\"Fodor's1988\">{{cite book|author=Fodor's|title=Fodor's 89 Cancun, Cozumel, Merida, the Yucatan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lt5pggSPkwkC|year=1988|publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications|isbn=978-0-679-01610-6}}</ref> Some organizations, such as BSAC, {{by whom|date=August 2015}} recommend that for snorkeling safety one should not snorkel alone,<ref name=safety /> but rather with a \"[[buddy diving|buddy]]\", a [[guide]] or a tour group.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n[[Underwater photography]] has become more and more popular since the early 2000s, resulting in millions of pictures posted every year on various websites and social media. This mass of documentation is endowed with an enormous scientific potential, as millions of tourists possess a much superior coverage power than professional scientists, who can not allow themselves to spend so much time in the field. \nAs a consequence, several participative sciences programs have been developed, supported by geo-localization and identification web sites, along with protocols for auto-organization and self-teaching aimed at biodiversity-interested snorkelers, in order for them to turn their observations into sound scientific data, available for research. This kind of approach has been successfully used in [[R\u00e9union island]], allowing for tens of new records and even new species.<ref name=\"CBM2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Bourjon |first1=Philippe |last2=Ducarme |first2=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last3=Quod |first3=Jean-Pascal |last4=Sweet |first4=Michael |year=2018 |title=Involving recreational snorkelers in inventory improvement or creation: a case study in the Indian Ocean |journal=Cahiers de Biologie Marine |volume=59 |issue= |pages=451\u2013460 |doi=10.21411/CBM.A.B05FC714 }}</ref>\n\nSnorkelers may progress to [[free-diving]] or [[recreational scuba diving]], which should be preceded by at least some training from a dive instructor or experienced free-diver.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Safety precautions ===\n[[File:Schnorchelweste snorkel vest.JPG|thumb|Snorkel vest]]\nSome commercial snorkeling organizations require snorkelers at their venue to wear an inflatable vest, similar to a [[personal flotation device]]. They are usually bright [[Yellow (colour)|yellow]] or [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and have a device that allows users to inflate or deflate the device to adjust their buoyancy. However, these devices hinder and prevent a snorkeler from free diving to any depth. Especially in cooler water, a wetsuit of appropriate thickness and coverage may be worn; wetsuits do provide some buoyancy without as much resistance to submersion. In the tropics, snorkelers (especially those with pale skin) often wear a [[rashguard]] or a shirt and/or [[board shorts]] in order to help protect the skin of the back and upper legs against sunburn.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe greatest danger to snorkelers are inshore and leisure craft such as jet skis, speed boats and the like. A snorkeler is often submerged in the water with only the tube visible above the surface. Since these craft can ply the same areas snorkelers visit, the chance for accidental collisions exists. Sailboats and sailboards are a particular hazard as their quiet propulsion systems may not alert the snorkeler of their presence. A snorkeler may surface underneath a vessel and/or be struck by it. Few locations demarcate small craft areas from snorkeling areas, unlike that done for regular beach-bathers, with areas marked by buoys. Snorkelers may therefore choose to wear bright or highly reflective colors/outfits and/or to employ [[dive flag]]s to enable easy spotting by boaters and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nSnorkelers' backs, ankles, and rear of their thighs can be exposed to the sun for extended periods, and can burn badly (even if slightly submerged), without being noticed in time. The wearing appropriate covering such as a \"[[rash guard]]\" with SPF (in warmer waters), a T-shirt, a wetsuit, and especially \"waterproof\" sunblock will mitigate this risk.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nDehydration is another concern. Hydrating well before entering the water is highly recommended, especially if one intends to snorkel for several hours. Proper hydration also prevents cramps. Snorkelers who hyperventilate to extend sub-surface time can experience [[hypocapnia]] if they hyperventilate prior to submerging. This can in turn lead to \"[[shallow water blackout]]\". Snorkeling with a buddy and remaining aware of the buddy's condition at all times can help avoid these difficulties.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nWhen snorkeling on or near [[coral reef]]s, care must be exercised to avoid contact with the delicate (and sometimes sharp or stinging) coral, and its poisonous inhabitants, usually by wearing protective gloves and being careful of one's environment. Coral scrapes and cuts often require specialized first aid treatment and potentially, emergency medical treatment to avoid infection. Booties and surf shoes are especially useful as they allow trekking over reefs exposed by low tide, to access drop-offs or deeper waters of the outer reef\u2014practices which are, however, considered ecologically irresponsible.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nContact with coral should always be avoided, because even boulder corals are fragile. Fin contact is a well-known cause of coral reef degradation.\n\nAnother safety concern is interaction and contact with the marine life during encounters.  While seals and sea turtles can seem harmless and docile, they can become alarmed if approached or feel threatened.  Some creatures, like moray eels, can hide in coral crevices and holes and will bite fingers in response to too much prodding.  For these reasons, snorkeling websites often recommend an \"observe but don't touch\" etiquette when snorkeling.<ref name=etiquette />\n\n===Snorkeling locations===\n[[File:Snorkelers watching fish.jpg|thumb|Snorkelers observing fish in [[Cozumel]], Mexico]]\nSnorkeling is possible in almost any body of water, but snorkelers are most likely to be found in locations where there are minimal waves, warm water, and something particularly interesting to see near the surface.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nGenerally shallow reefs ranging from {{convert|1|to|4|m|ft|sp=us|0}} are favored by snorkelers. Enough water cover to swim over the top without kicking the bottom is needed, but shallow structure can be approached from the sides. Deeper reefs can also be explored, but repeated breath-holding to dive to those depths limits the number of practitioners, and raises the bar on the required fitness and skill level. Risk increases with increased depth and duration of the breath-hold excursions from the surface.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Variants and related activities===\n*[[Bog snorkeling]]: An individual [[sport]], popular in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]].\n*[[Finswimming]]: An individual [[sport]], the most popular competitive sport of CMAS, the only of this federation present in [[World Games]].

In cooler waters, a [[wetsuit]] may also be worn. Use of this equipment allows the snorkeler to observe underwater attractions for extended periods  with relatively little effort and to breathe while face-down at the surface.\n\nSnorkeling is a popular [[recreation]]al activity, particularly at [[tropics|tropical]] [[resort]] locations. The primary appeal is the opportunity to observe [[marine biology#Lifeforms|underwater life]] in a natural setting without the complicated equipment and training required for [[scuba diving]]. It appeals to all ages because of how little effort there is, and without the exhaled bubbles of scuba-diving equipment. It is the basis of the two surface disciplines of the  [[underwater sports|underwater sport]] of [[finswimming]].<ref name=finswimmimg />\n\nSnorkeling is also used by scuba divers when on the surface, in underwater sports such as [[underwater hockey]] and [[underwater rugby]], and as part of water-based searches conducted by [[search and rescue]] teams.\n==Equipment==\nEssential equipment includes the [[Snorkel (swimming)|snorkel]] for breathing, and a [[diving mask]] or [[swimming goggles]] for vision. [[Swimfin]]s for more efficient propulsion are common. Environmental protection against cold, sunburn and marine stings and scratches is also regionally popular, and may be in the form of a [[wetsuit]], [[diving skins]], or [[rash vest]]. Some snorkellers rely on waterproof [[sunscreen]] lotions, but some of these are environmentally damaging. If necessary the snorkeller may wear a [[weightbelt]] to facilitate [[freediving]], or an inflatable snorkelling vest, a form of [[buoyancy aid]], for safety.\n\n=== Snorkel ===\n{{main|Snorkel (swimming)}}\n[[File:Vieques underwater a.jpg|thumb|Adult's snorkel]]\n[[File:Tuba enfant.jpg|thumb|Child's snorkel]]\nA snorkel is a device used for breathing air from above the surface when the wearer's head is face downwards in the water with the mouth and the nose submerged. It may be either separate or integrated into a swimming or diving [[diving mask|mask]]. The integrated version is only suitable for surface snorkeling, while the separate device may also be used for [[underwater sports|underwater activities]] such as [[spearfishing]], [[freediving]], [[finswimming]], [[underwater hockey]], [[underwater rugby]] and for surface breathing with [[scuba equipment]]. A swimmer's snorkel is a tube bent into a shape often resembling the letter \"L\" or \"J\", fitted with a [[mouthpiece (scuba)|mouthpiece]] at the lower end and constructed of light metal, [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. The snorkel may come with a [[rubber]] loop or a plastic clip enabling the snorkel to be attached to the outside of the head strap of the [[diving mask]]. Although the snorkel may also be secured by tucking the tube between the mask-strap and the head, this alternative strategy can lead to physical discomfort, mask leakage or even snorkel loss.<ref>Steve Blount and Herb Taylor, ''The Joy of Snorkeling'', New York, NY: Pisces Book Company, 1984, p. 21.</ref>\n\nSnorkels constitute respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]]. When the user takes in a fresh breath, some of the previously exhaled air which remains in the snorkel is inhaled again, reducing the amount of fresh air in the inhaled volume, and increasing the risk of a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood, which can result in [[hypercapnia]]. The greater the volume of the tube, and the smaller the [[tidal volume]] of breathing, the more this problem is exacerbated. A smaller diameter tube reduces the dead volume, but also increases resistance to airflow and so increases the work of breathing. Including the internal volume of the mask in the breathing circuit greatly expands the dead space. Occasional exhalation through the nose while snorkeling with a separate snorkel will slightly reduce the buildup of carbon dioxide, and may help in keeping the mask clear of water, but in cold water it will increase fogging. To some extent the effect of dead space can be counteracted by breathing more deeply and slowly, as this reduces the dead space ratio and [[work of breathing]].\n\n[[File:Snorkel shapes.jpg|thumb|Basic snorkel shapes]]\nSnorkels come in two orientations: Front-mounted and side-mounted. The first snorkel to be patented in 1938 was front-mounted, worn with the tube over the front of the face and secured with a bracket to the diving mask. Front-mounted snorkels proved popular in European snorkeling until the late 1950s, when side-mounted snorkels came into the ascendancy. Front-mounted snorkels experienced a comeback a decade later as a piece of competitive swimming equipment to be used in pool workouts and in finswimming races, where they outperform side-mounted snorkels in streamlining.\n\n==== Plain snorkel ====\nA plain snorkel consists essentially of a tube with a mouthpiece to be inserted between the lips.\n[[File:Snorkel attachment methods.jpg|thumb|Snorkel attachment methods]]\n[[File:Snorkel mouthpieces.jpg|thumb|Snorkel mouthpieces]]\nThe barrel is the hollow tube leading from the supply end at the top of the snorkel to the mouthpiece at the bottom. The barrel is made of a relatively rigid material such as plastic, light metal or hard rubber. The bore is the interior chamber of the barrel; bore length, diameter and bends all affect breathing resistance.\n\nThe top of the barrel may be open to the elements or fitted with a valve designed to shut off the air supply from the atmosphere when the top is submerged. There may be a high visibility band around the top to alert other water users of the snorkeller's presence. The simplest way of attaching the snorkel to the head is to slip the top of the barrel between the mask strap and the head. This may cause the mask to leak, however, and alternative means of attachment of the barrel to the head include threading the mask strap a moulded on the barrel, using a figure-8 rubber snorkel keeper pulled down over the barrel, or a rotatable plastic snorkel keeper clipped to the barrel\n\nThe mouthpiece helps to keep the snorkel in the mouth. It is made of soft and flexible material, originally natural rubber and more recently silicone or [[PVC]]. The commonest of the multiple designs available<ref>P. P. Serebrenitsky: ''\u0422\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0432\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430'', Lenizdat, 1969, p. 92.

A tight grip with the teeth can also cause jaw fatigue and pain.\n\n====Full-face snorkel mask====\n[[File:Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask.jpg|thumb|Decathlon Easybreath snorkel mask]]\nAn integrated snorkel consists essentially of a tube topped with a shut-off valve and opening at the bottom into the interior of a diving mask. Integrated snorkels must be fitted with valves to shut off the snorkel's air inlet when submerged. Water will otherwise pour into the opening at the top and flood the interior of the mask. Snorkels are attached to sockets on the top or the sides of the mask.\n\nNew-generation snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, the nose and the mouth. They enable surface snorkellers to breathe nasally or orally and may be a workaround in the case of surface snorkellers who [[Pharyngeal reflex|gag]] in response to the presence of standard snorkel mouthpieces in their mouths. Some early snorkel-masks are full-face masks covering the eyes, nose and mouth, while others exclude the mouth, covering the eyes and the nose only. The 1950s [[US Divers]] \"Marino\" hybrid comprised a single snorkel mask with eye and nose coverage and a separate snorkel for the mouth.<ref>''Early Mfg. & Retailers - US Divers No.43''. Retrieved on 26 February 2019 at http://www.skindivinghistory.com/mfg_retailers/u/US_Divers/43.html.</ref>\n\nFull face snorkel masks use an integral snorkel with separate channels for intake and exhaled gases theoretically ensuring the user is always breathing untainted fresh air whatever the respiratory effort. Built-in dry top snorkel system. In addition to a standard ball float system that stops the water from entering the tube when submerged, full-face masks are designed in such a way that even if a small amount of water does get into the snorkel, it will be channeled away from the face and into the chin area of the mask. A special valve located on the bottom of the chin allows to drain the water out. The main problem is that it must fit the whole face well enough to make a reliable seal and since no two faces are the same shape, it may not seal adequately on any specific user. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing.{{Clarify|reason=can these masks  not be cleared in place?|date=September 2019}} Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below, since the mask covers the nose with a rigid plastic structure, which makes it impossible to pinch the nose if needed to equalise pressure at greater depth. Trained scuba divers are likely to avoid such devices<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dipndive.com/blog/full-face-snorkeling-masks-pros-and-cons.html|title=Full-Face Snorkeling Masks: Pros And Cons|accessdate=October 15, 2017}}</ref> however snorkel masks are a boon for those with medical conditions that preclude taking part in scuba diving.{{cn|date=February 2019}}{{clarify|reason=how, specifically, are snorkel masks a \"boon\" for these people?|date=February 2019}}\n\nAs a result of a short period with an unusually high number of snorkeling deaths in Hawaii<ref>https://www.letsgotomaui.net/da-kine/full-face-snorkel-mask-dangers/</ref> there is some suspicion that the design of the masks can result in buildup of excess CO<sub>2</sub>. It is far from certain that the masks are at fault, but the state of Hawaii has begun to track the equipment being used in cases of snorkeling fatalities. Besides the possibility that the masks, or at least some brands of the mask, are a cause, other theories include the possibility that the masks make snorkeling accessible to people who have difficulty with traditional snorkeling equipment. That ease of access may result in more snorkelers who lack experience or have underlying medical conditions, possibly exacerbating problems that are unrelated to the type of equipment being used.<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaii-full-face-snorkel-mask-related-deaths/</ref>\n\n===Diving mask===\n{{main|Diving mask}}\n[[File:Snorkeling gear.jpg|thumb|right|Typical snorkeling equipment: snorkel, diving mask and swimfins]]\nSnorkelers normally wear the same kind of mask as those worn by scuba divers. By creating an airspace, the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater. All scuba diving masks consist of the lenses also known as a faceplate, a soft rubber skirt, which encloses the nose and seals against the face, and a head strap to hold it in place. There are different styles and shapes. These range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials; common choices are silicone and rubber. A snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmer's goggles which do not enclose the nose.\n\n===Swimfins===\n{{Main|Swimfin}}\nSwimfins, fins or flippers are [[fin]]like accessories worn on the feet,<ref name=\"AlainPerrier\" />  and usually made from [[rubber]] or [[plastic]], to aid movement through the water in [[Water sport (recreation)|water sports]] activities.

Short, stiff-bladed fins are effective for short bursts of acceleration and maneuvering.\n\n===Exposure protection===\n{{see also|Wetsuit|Dive skins|Rash guard}}\nA [[wetsuit]] is a garment, usually made of foamed neoprene with a knit fabric facing, which is worn by people engaged in water sports and other activities in or on water, primarily providing thermal insulation, but also buoyancy and protection from abrasion, ultraviolet exposure and stings from marine organisms. The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water. The thickness, fit and coverage of the suit are important factors for insulation.\n\n[[Diving suit#Dive skins|Dive skins]] are used when diving in water temperatures above {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. They are usually one piece full length garments made from [[spandex|spandex or Lycra]] and provide little thermal protection, but do protect the skin from [[jellyfish]] stings, abrasion and [[sunburn]]. This kind of suit is also known as a 'Stinger Suit'. Some divers wear a dive skin under a wetsuit, which allows easier donning and (for those who experience skin problems from neoprene) provides additional comfort.<ref name=\"EcoStinger 2014\" />\n\nA [[rash guard]], also known as rash vest or rashie, is an athletic shirt made of spandex and nylon or polyester. The name rash guard reflects the fact that the shirt protects the wearer against rashes caused by abrasion, or by sunburn from extended exposure to the sun. These shirts can be worn by themselves, or under a wetsuit. A rash guard by itself is used for light coverage in warm to extreme summer temperatures for several watersports including snorkeling. There are also lower body rash guards, which are similar to compression shorts to be worn under the surfers' boardshorts.\n\n===Weight belt===\n{{See also|Diver weighting system#Weight belt}}\n[[File:Zavorra.JPG|thumb|Typical weight belt ]]\nWeight belts are the most common weighting system currently in use for snorkeling.<ref>[http://ygraine.membrane.com/enterhtml/live/scuba/products.html Scuba diving air Regulators, buoyancy compensators scuba diving equipment, information advice help with scuba gear products safety - Philadelphia Area Dive Shops<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621090205/http://ygraine.membrane.com/enterhtml/live/scuba/products.html |date=June 21, 2007 }}</ref> They are generally made of tough [[nylon]] webbing, but other materials such as [[rubber]] can be used. Weight belts for snorkeling are generally fitted with a quick release buckle to allow the dumping of weight rapidly in an emergency.\n\nThe most common design of weight used with a belt is rectangular [[lead]] blocks with two slots in them threaded onto the belt. These blocks can be coated in [[plastic]], which increases corrosion resistance. The plastic coated weights may be marketed as being less abrasive to [[wetsuits]]. The weights may be constrained from sliding along the webbing by metal or plastic [[Glossary of underwater diving terminology#belt slide|belt sliders]]. Another popular style has a single slot through which the belt can be threaded. These are sometimes locked in position by squeezing the weight to grip the webbing, but this makes them difficult to remove when less weight is needed. There are also weight designs which may be added to the belt by clipping on when needed. The amount of weight needed depends mainly on the buoyancy of the wet suit.\n\n===Snorkeling vest===\nAn inflatable [[Personal flotation device|personal buoyancy aid]] designed for surface swimming applications. In shape, often like a horse-collar [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy compensator]], or [[airline]] [[life jacket]], but only with oral inflation or a CO<sub>2</sub> cartridge for emergencies.\n\n== Operation ==\nThe simplest type of snorkel is a plain tube that is allowed to flood when [[underwater]]. The snorkeler expels water from the snorkel either with a sharp exhalation on return to the surface (''blast clearing'') or by tilting the head back shortly before reaching the surface and exhaling until reaching or breaking the surface (''displacement method'') and facing forward or down again before inhaling the next breath. The displacement method expels water by filling the snorkel with air; it is a technique that takes practice but clears the snorkel with less effort, but only works when surfacing. Clearing splash water while at the surface requires blast clearing.<ref>Underwater World, ''Unit 3- Diving Skills''. Retrieved on 28 February 2019 at https://www.diveunderwaterworld.com/s/Chapter-3-Diving-Skills.pdf.</ref>\n\nExperienced users tend to develop a surface breathing style which minimises work of breathing, carbon dioxide buildup and risk of water inspiration, while optimising water removal. This involves a sharp puff in the early stage of exhalation, which is effective for clearing the tube of remaining water, and a fairly large but comfortable exhaled volume, mostly fairly slowly for low work of breathing, followed by an immediate slow inhalation, which reduces entrainment of any residual water, to a comfortable but relatively large inhaled volume, repeated without delay. Elastic recoil is used to assist with the initial puff, which can be made sharper by controlling the start of exhalation with the tongue. This technique is most applicable to relaxed cruising on the surface. Racing finswimmers may use a different technique as they need a far greater level of ventilation when working hard. \n\nSome snorkels have a [[sump]] at the lowest point to allow a small volume of water to remain in the snorkel without being inhaled when the snorkeler breathes. Some also have a [[non-return valve]] in the sump, to drain water in the tube when the diver exhales. The water is pushed out through the valve when the tube is blocked by water and the exhalation pressure exceeds the water pressure on the outside of the valve. This is almost exactly the mechanism of blast clearing which does not require the valve, but the pressure required is marginally less, and effective blast clearing requires a higher flow rate. The full face mask has a double airflow valve which allows breathing through the nose in addition to the mouth.<ref>Snorkel Ken, \"Full Face Snorkel Mask Reviews | Tribord EasyBreathe Alternatives and Best Prices\". Retrieved on 3 March 2019 at https://snorkelstore.net/full-face-snorkel-mask-review-lower-price-lower-quality/.</ref> A few models of snorkel have float-operated valves attached to the top end of the tube to keep water out when a wave passes, but these cause problems when diving as the snorkel must then be equalized during descent, using part of the diver's inhaled air supply. Some recent designs have a splash deflector on the top end that reduces entry of any water that splashes over the top end of the tube, thereby keeping it relatively free from water.<ref>US patent 5,404,872, ''Splash-guard for snorkel tubes'', April 11, 1995.

Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://monofin.co.uk/blog-snorkels.html</ref>\n\nA common problem with all mechanical clearing mechanisms is their tendency to fail if infrequently used, or if stored for long periods, or through environmental fouling, or owing to lack of maintenance. Many also either slightly increase the flow resistance of the snorkel, or provide a small water trap, which retains a little water in the tube after clearing.<ref>''Snorkel Care''. Retrieved on 1 March 2019 at https://www.scubadoctor.com.au/care-snorkel.htm.</ref>\n\nModern designs use [[silicone rubber]] in the mouthpiece and one-way clearing and float valves due to its resistance to degradation and its long service life. [[Natural rubber]] was formerly used, but slowly oxidizes and breaks down due to ultraviolet light exposure from the sun. It eventually loses its flexibility, becomes brittle and cracks, which can cause clearing valves to stick in the open or closed position, and float valves to leak due to a failure of the valve seat to seal. In even older designs, some snorkels were made with small \"[[ping pong]]\" balls in a [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] mounted to the open end of the tube to prevent water ingress. These are no longer sold or recommended because they are unreliable and considered hazardous. Similarly, [[diving mask]]s with a built-in snorkel are considered unsafe by scuba diving organizations such as PADI, BSAC because they can engender a false sense of security and can be difficult to clear if flooded.\n\nA snorkel may be either separate or integrated into a swim or dive [[diving mask|mask]]. Usage of the term \"snorkel\" in this section excludes devices integrated with, and opening into, swimmers' or divers' masks. A separate snorkel typically comprises a tube for breathing and a means of attaching the tube to the head of the wearer. The tube has an opening at the top and a mouthpiece at the bottom. Some tubes are topped with a valve to prevent water from entering the tube when it is [[Underwater|submerged]].\n\nThe total length, inner diameter and/or inner volume of a snorkel tube are matters of utmost importance because they affect the user's ability to breathe normally while swimming or floating head downwards on the surface of the water. These dimensions also have implications for the user's ability to blow residual water out of the tube when surfacing. An overlong snorkel tube may cause breathing resistance, while an overwide tube may prove hard to clear of water. A high-volume tube is liable to encourage a build-up of stale air, including exhaled carbon dioxide, because it constitutes respiratory [[Deadspace (in breathing apparatus)|dead space]].\n\n==Practice of snorkeling ==\n[[File:Sea Garden of BUNAKEN.jpg|thumb|Snorkeler with mask and snorkel]]\nSnorkeling is an activity in its own right, as well as an adjunct to other activities, such as breath-hold diving, [[spearfishing]] and [[scuba diving]],<ref name=\"NOAA Diving Manual 1979\" /> and several competitive [[underwater sports]], such as [[underwater hockey]] and [[finswimming]]. In all cases, the use of a snorkel facilitates breathing while swimming at the surface and observing what is going on under the water.\n\nBeing non-competitive, snorkeling is considered more a leisure activity than a [[sport]].<ref name=\"Jennings2007\">{{cite book|author=Gayle Jennings|title=Water-Based Tourism, Sport, Leisure, and Recreation Experiences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBAGX5l5uuwC&pg=PA130|date=2 April 2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-34928-7|pages=130\u2013}}</ref> Snorkeling requires no special training, only the very basic swimming abilities and being able to breathe through the snorkel.<ref name=\"Fodor's1988\">{{cite book|author=Fodor's|title=Fodor's 89 Cancun, Cozumel, Merida, the Yucatan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lt5pggSPkwkC|year=1988|publisher=Fodor's Travel Publications|isbn=978-0-679-01610-6}}</ref> Some organizations, such as BSAC, {{by whom|date=August 2015}} recommend that for snorkeling safety one should not snorkel alone,<ref name=safety /> but rather with a \"[[buddy diving|buddy]]\", a [[guide]] or a tour group.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n[[Underwater photography]] has become more and more popular since the early 2000s, resulting in millions of pictures posted every year on various websites and social media. This mass of documentation is endowed with an enormous scientific potential, as millions of tourists possess a much superior coverage power than professional scientists, who can not allow themselves to spend so much time in the field. \nAs a consequence, several participative sciences programs have been developed, supported by geo-localization and identification web sites, along with protocols for auto-organization and self-teaching aimed at biodiversity-interested snorkelers, in order for them to turn their observations into sound scientific data, available for research. This kind of approach has been successfully used in [[R\u00e9union island]], allowing for tens of new records and even new species.<ref name=\"CBM2018\">{{cite journal |last1=Bourjon |first1=Philippe |last2=Ducarme |first2=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric |last3=Quod |first3=Jean-Pascal |last4=Sweet |first4=Michael |year=2018 |title=Involving recreational snorkelers in inventory improvement or creation: a case study in the Indian Ocean |journal=Cahiers de Biologie Marine |volume=59 |issue= |pages=451\u2013460 |doi=10.21411/CBM.A.B05FC714 }}</ref>\n\nSnorkelers may progress to [[free-diving]] or [[recreational scuba diving]], which should be preceded by at least some training from a dive instructor or experienced free-diver.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n=== Safety precautions ===\n[[File:Schnorchelweste snorkel vest.JPG|thumb|Snorkel vest]]\nSome commercial snorkeling organizations require snorkelers at their venue to wear an inflatable vest, similar to a [[personal flotation device]]. They are usually bright [[Yellow (colour)|yellow]] or [[Orange (colour)|orange]] and have a device that allows users to inflate or deflate the device to adjust their buoyancy. However, these devices hinder and prevent a snorkeler from free diving to any depth. Especially in cooler water, a wetsuit of appropriate thickness and coverage may be worn; wetsuits do provide some buoyancy without as much resistance to submersion. In the tropics, snorkelers (especially those with pale skin) often wear a [[rashguard]] or a shirt and/or [[board shorts]] in order to help protect the skin of the back and upper legs against sunburn.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe greatest danger to snorkelers are inshore and leisure craft such as jet skis, speed boats and the like. A snorkeler is often submerged in the water with only the tube visible above the surface. Since these craft can ply the same areas snorkelers visit, the chance for accidental collisions exists. Sailboats and sailboards are a particular hazard as their quiet propulsion systems may not alert the snorkeler of their presence. A snorkeler may surface underneath a vessel and/or be struck by it. Few locations demarcate small craft areas from snorkeling areas, unlike that done for regular beach-bathers, with areas marked by buoys. Snorkelers may therefore choose to wear bright or highly reflective colors/outfits and/or to employ [[dive flag]]s to enable easy spotting by boaters and others.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nSnorkelers' backs, ankles, and rear of their thighs can be exposed to the sun for extended periods, and can burn badly (even if slightly submerged), without being noticed in time. The wearing appropriate covering such as a \"[[rash guard]]\" with SPF (in warmer waters), a T-shirt, a wetsuit, and especially \"waterproof\" sunblock will mitigate this risk.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nDehydration is another concern. Hydrating well before entering the water is highly recommended, especially if one intends to snorkel for several hours. Proper hydration also prevents cramps. Snorkelers who hyperventilate to extend sub-surface time can experience [[hypocapnia]] if they hyperventilate prior to submerging. This can in turn lead to \"[[shallow water blackout]]\". Snorkeling with a buddy and remaining aware of the buddy's condition at all times can help avoid these difficulties.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nWhen snorkeling on or near [[coral reef]]s, care must be exercised to avoid contact with the delicate (and sometimes sharp or stinging) coral, and its poisonous inhabitants, usually by wearing protective gloves and being careful of one's environment. Coral scrapes and cuts often require specialized first aid treatment and potentially, emergency medical treatment to avoid infection. Booties and surf shoes are especially useful as they allow trekking over reefs exposed by low tide, to access drop-offs or deeper waters of the outer reef\u2014practices which are, however, considered ecologically irresponsible.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nContact with coral should always be avoided, because even boulder corals are fragile. Fin contact is a well-known cause of coral reef degradation.\n\nAnother safety concern is interaction and contact with the marine life during encounters.  While seals and sea turtles can seem harmless and docile, they can become alarmed if approached or feel threatened.  Some creatures, like moray eels, can hide in coral crevices and holes and will bite fingers in response to too much prodding.  For these reasons, snorkeling websites often recommend an \"observe but don't touch\" etiquette when snorkeling.<ref name=etiquette />\n\n===Snorkeling locations===\n[[File:Snorkelers watching fish.jpg|thumb|Snorkelers observing fish in [[Cozumel]], Mexico]]\nSnorkeling is possible in almost any body of water, but snorkelers are most likely to be found in locations where there are minimal waves, warm water, and something particularly interesting to see near the surface.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nGenerally shallow reefs ranging from {{convert|1|to|4|m|ft|sp=us|0}} are favored by snorkelers. Enough water cover to swim over the top without kicking the bottom is needed, but shallow structure can be approached from the sides. Deeper reefs can also be explored, but repeated breath-holding to dive to those depths limits the number of practitioners, and raises the bar on the required fitness and skill level. Risk increases with increased depth and duration of the breath-hold excursions from the surface.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\n===Variants and related activities===\n*[[Bog snorkeling]]: An individual [[sport]], popular in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]].\n*[[Finswimming]]: An individual [[sport]], the most popular competitive sport of CMAS, the only of this federation present in [[World Games]].

[[Military technology]] of the time included important innovations in [[machine gun]]s, [[grenade]]s, and artillery, along with essentially new weapons such as [[submarine]]s, [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]], [[warplane]]s and [[Tanks in World War I|tanks]].<ref>Tucker, Spencer C. (1998) ''The Great War: 1914-18''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press; p. 11</ref>\n\nOne could characterize the earlier years of the First World War as a clash of 20th-century [[technology]] with 19th-century [[military science]] creating ineffective battles with huge numbers of casualties on both sides. On land, only in the final year of the war did the major armies make effective steps in revolutionizing matters of command and control and tactics to adapt to the modern battlefield and start to harness the myriad new technologies to effective military purposes. Tactical reorganizations (such as shifting the focus of command from the 100+ man [[Company (military unit)|company]] to the 10+ man [[squad]]) went hand-in-hand with armored cars, the first submachine guns, and automatic rifles that a single individual soldier could carry and use.\n\n== Trench warfare ==\n{{Main|Trench warfare}}\nThe new metallurgical and chemical industries created new firepower that briefly simplified defense before new approaches to [[Offensive (military)|attack]] evolved. The application of infantry [[rifle]]s, rifled [[artillery]] with [[hydraulic recoil mechanism]]s, zigzag trenches and [[machine gun]]s made it difficult or nearly impossible to cross defended ground. The [[hand grenade]], long used in crude form, developed rapidly as an aid in attacking trenches. Probably the most important was the introduction of [[Shell (projectile)#High-explosive|high explosive shells]], which dramatically increased the [[lethality]] of artillery over the 19th-century equivalents.\n\nTrench warfare led to the development of the concrete [[Pillbox (military)|pill box]], a small, hardened blockhouse that could be used to deliver machine gun fire. Pillboxes could be placed across a battlefield with interlocking fields of fire.<ref>{{Citation \n |author1=March, F. A. |author2=Beamish, R. J. | year=1919\n | title=History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War\n | publisher=Leslie-Judge }}</ref>\n\nBecause attacking an entrenched enemy was so difficult, [[tunnel warfare]] became a major effort during the war. Once enemy positions were undermined, huge amounts of explosives would be planted and detonated as part preparation for an overland charge. Sensitive listening devices that could detect the sounds of digging were a crucial method of defense against these underground incursions. The British proved especially adept at these tactics, thanks to the skill of their tunnel-digging \"[[sapper]]s\" and the sophistication of their listening devices.\n\nDuring the First World War, the static movement of [[trench warfare]] and a need for protection from [[sniper]]s created a requirement for [[Loophole (firearm)|loopholes]] both for discharging firearms and for observation.<ref name=\"One\">[https://ww1revisited.com/2014/03/16/trench-loopholes-le-linge/ Trench Loopholes, Le Linge]</ref>  Often a steel plate was used with a \"key hole\", which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\n=== Clothing ===\n[[File:Temporary exhibition about WWI, gare de Paris-Est, 2014 (German helmets).jpg|thumb|German helmets went from leather to steel]]\nThe British and German armies had already changed from [[red coat (British army)]] (1902) or [[Prussian blue]] (1910) for field uniforms, to less conspicuous [[khaki]] or [[field gray]]. [[Adolphe Messimy]], [[Joseph Gallieni]] and other French leaders had proposed following suit, but the French army marched to war in their traditional red trousers, and only began receiving the new \"[[French Army in World War I#Uniforms|horizon blue]]\" ones in 1915.\n\nA type of raincoat for British officers, introduced long before the war, gained fame as the [[trench coat]].\n\nThe principal armies entered the war under cloth caps or leather helmets. They hastened to develop new [[steel helmet]]s, in designs that became icons of their respective countries.\n\n== Artillery ==\n{{Further|Artillery of World War I}}\n\n[[File:Cannon 75 mm Schneider with limber Memorial de Verdun.JPG|thumb|French [[Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897]] gave quick, accurate fire in a small, agile unit, but the Western Front often needed longer range]]\n[[Image:7.7 cm FK 16 CMHM Brantford 1.JPG|right|thumb|German [[7.7 cm FK 16]], developed during the war because an earlier model had insufficient range]]\n[[File:Austro-Hungarian artillery 1914.jpg|thumb|Austro-Hungarian artillery 1914]]\nIn the 19th century, Britain and France exploited the rapid technical developments in [[artillery]] to serve a [[War of Movement]]. Such weapons served well in the colonial wars of that century, and served Germany very well in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], but trench warfare was more like a [[siege]], and called for [[siege gun]]s. The German army had already anticipated that a European war might require heavier artillery, hence had a more appropriate mix of sizes. Foundries responded to the actual situation with more heavy products and fewer highly mobile pieces. Germany developed the [[Paris gun]]s of stupendous size and range. However, the necessarily stupendous [[muzzle velocity]] wore out a gun barrel after a few shots requiring a return to the factory for relining, so these weapons served more to frighten and anger urban people than to kill them or devastate their cities.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, artillery was often sited in the front line to fire over open sights at enemy infantry. During the war, the following improvements were made:\n\n* The first \"box [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]]\" in history was fired in the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915; this was the use of a three- or four-sided curtain of shell-fire to prevent the movement of enemy infantry\n* The wire-cutting [[No. 106 fuze]] was developed, specifically designed to explode on contact with barbed wire, or the ground before the shell buried itself in mud, and equally effective as an [[anti-personnel]] weapon\n* The first [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were devised out of necessity\n* Indirect [[counter-battery fire]] was developed for the first time \n* [[Artillery sound ranging]] and [[flash spotting]], for the location and eventual destruction of enemy batteries\n* The [[creeping barrage]] was perfected\n* Factors such as weather, air temperature, and barrel wear could for the first time be accurately measured and taken into account for [[indirect fire]]\n* [[Forward observer]]s were used to direct artillery positioned out of direct line of sight from the targets, and sophisticated communications and fire plans were developed\n\n[[Field artillery]] entered the war with the idea that each gun should be accompanied by hundreds of shells, and armories ought to have about a thousand on hand for resupply. This proved utterly inadequate when it became commonplace for a gun to sit in one place and fire a hundred shells or more per day for weeks or months on end. To meet the resulting [[Shell Crisis of 1915]], factories were hastily converted from other purposes to make more ammunition. Railways to the front were expanded or built, leaving the question of the [[last mile]]. [[Horses in World War I]] were the main answer, and their high death rate seriously weakened the Central Powers late in the war. In many places the newly invented [[trench railway]]s helped. The new motor [[truck]]s as yet lacked pneumatic tires, versatile suspension, and other improvements that in later decades would allow them to perform well.\n\nThe majority of casualties inflicted during the war were the result of artillery fire.\n\n== Poison gas ==\n{{Main|Poison gas in World War I}}\n[[Image:Australian infantry small box respirators Ypres 1917.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Australian infantry with gas masks, [[Ypres]], 1917.]]\n[[Chemical weapon]]s were first used systematically in this war. [[Chemical weapons in World War I]] included [[phosgene]], [[tear gas]], [[Adamsite|chlorarsine]]s and [[mustard gas]].\n\nAt the beginning of the war, Germany had the most advanced chemical industry in the world, accounting for more than 80% of the world's dye and chemical production. Although the use of poison gas had been banned by the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], [[Germany]] turned to this industry for what it hoped would be a decisive weapon to break the deadlock of trench warfare. [[Chlorine]] gas was first used on the battlefield in April 1915 at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] in [[Belgium]]. The unknown gas appeared to be a simple [[smoke screen]], used to hide attacking soldiers, and Allied troops were ordered to the front trenches to repel the expected attack. The gas had a devastating effect, killing many defenders or when the wind direction changed and blew the gas back, many attackers. Because the gas killed the attackers, depending on the wind, a more reliable way had to be made to transmit the gas. It began being delivered in artillery shells.<ref>[[Chemical weapons in World War I]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2018}} Later, [[mustard gas]], [[phosgene]] and other gases were used. Britain and France soon followed suit with their own gas weapons. The first defenses against gas were makeshift, mainly rags soaked in water or [[urine]]. Later, relatively effective [[gas mask]]s were developed, and these greatly reduced the effectiveness of gas as a weapon. Although it sometimes resulted in brief tactical advantages and probably caused over 1,000,000 casualties, gas seemed to have had no significant effect on the course of the war.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nChemical weapons were easily attained, and cheap. Gas was especially effective against troops in trenches and bunkers that protected them from other weapons. Chemical weapons attacked an individual's respiratory system. The concept of choking easily caused fear in soldiers and the resulting terror affected them psychologically. Because there was such a great fear of chemical weapons it was not uncommon that a soldier would panic and misinterpret symptoms of the common cold as being affected by a poisonous gas.\n\n== Command and control ==\n{{Main|Command and control}}\n\nIn the early days of the war, generals tried to direct tactics from headquarters many miles from the front, with messages being carried back and forth by [[courier]]s on motorcycles. It was soon realized that more immediate methods of communication were needed.\n\n[[Radio]] sets of the period were too heavy to carry into battle, and [[field telephone]] lines laid were quickly broken. Runners, flashing lights, and mirrors were often used instead; dogs were also used, though they were only used occasionally as troops tended to adopt them as pets and men would volunteer to go as runners in the dog's place. There were also [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]] (called \"contact patrols\") that carried messages between headquarters and forward positions, sometimes dropping their messages without landing.\n\nThe new long-range artillery developed just before the war now had to fire at positions it could not see. Typical tactics were to pound the enemy front lines and then stop to let infantry move forward, hoping that the enemy line was broken, though it rarely was. The lifting and then the [[barrage (artillery)#Development of the creeping barrage|creeping barrage]] were developed to keep artillery fire landing directly in front of the infantry \"as it advanced.\" Communications being impossible, the danger was that the barrage would move too fast \u2014 losing the protection \u2014 or too slowly \u2014 holding up the advance.\n\nThere were also countermeasures to these artillery tactics: by aiming a counter barrage directly behind an enemy's creeping barrage, one could target the infantry that was following the creeping barrage. Microphones ([[Sound ranging]]) were used to triangulate the position of enemy guns and engage in [[counter-battery fire]]. Muzzle flashes of guns could also be spotted and used to target enemy artillery.\n\n== Railways ==\n{{wide image|Wrecked ammunition train3.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|German ammunition train wrecked by shell fire, c. 1918.}}\n[[File:Somme -- French Auto in mud LOC 15276629134.jpg|thumb|Motor trucks rarely performed well]]\nRailways dominated in this war as in no other. [[Schlieffen Plan|The German strategy]] was known beforehand by the Allies simply because of the vast marshaling yards on the Belgian border that had no other purpose than to deliver the mobilized German army to its start point. The German mobilization plan was little more than a vast detailed railway timetable. Men and material could get to the front at an unprecedented rate by rail, but trains were vulnerable at the front itself. Thus, armies could only advance at the pace that they could build or rebuild a railway, e.g. [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|the British advance across Sinai]]. Motorized transport was only extensively used in the last two years of World War I. After the rail head, troops moved the [[last mile]] on foot, and guns and supplies were drawn by horses and [[trench railways]]. Railways lacked the flexibility of motor transport and this lack of flexibility percolated through into the conduct of the war.\n\n== War of attrition ==\nThe countries involved in the war applied the full force of industrial mass-production to the manufacture of weapons and ammunition, especially artillery shells. [[Female roles in the World Wars|Women on the home-front]] played a crucial role in this by working in munitions factories. This complete mobilization of a nation's resources, or \"[[total war]]\" meant that not only the armies, but also the economies of the warring nations were in competition.\n\nFor a time, in 1914\u20131915, some hoped that the war could be won through an attrition of [[materiel]]\u2014that the enemy's supply of artillery shells could be exhausted in futile exchanges. But production was ramped up on both sides and hopes proved futile. In Britain the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]] brought down the British government, and led to the building of [[HM Factory, Gretna]], a huge munitions factory on the English-Scottish border.\n\nThe [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] then focused on another resource: human lives. In the [[Battle of Verdun]] in particular, German Chief of Staff [[Erich Von Falkenhayn]] hoped to \"bleed France white\" through repeated attacks on this French city.\n\nIn the end, the war ended through a combination of attrition (of men and material), advances on the battlefield, arrival of American troops in large numbers, and a breakdown of morale and production on the [[Home front during World War I#Germany|German home-front]] due to an effective [[naval blockade]] of her seaports.\n\n== Air warfare ==\n{{Main|Aviation in World War I}}\n[[Image:Fokker Dr1 on the ground.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Fokker Dr.I|Fokker triplane]] belonging to [[Manfred von Richthofen]] (the \"Red Baron\")]]\n\n[[Aviation in World War I]] started with primitive aircraft, primitively used. Technological progress was swift, leading to ground attack, [[tactical bombing]], and highly publicized, deadly [[dogfight]]s among aircraft equipped with forward-firing, [[Synchronization gear|synchronized]] [[machine gun]]s [[Synchronization gear#The Fokker Stangensteuerung gear|from July 1915]] onwards. However, these uses made a lesser impact on the war than more mundane roles in intelligence, sea patrol and especially [[artillery spotting]]. [[Antiaircraft warfare]] also had its beginnings in this war.\n\nAs with most technologies, aircraft and their use underwent many improvements during World War I. As the initial war of movement on the Western Front settled into trench warfare, [[aerial reconnaissance]] over the front added to the difficulty of mounting surprise attacks against entrenched and concealed defenders.\n\nManned [[observation balloon]]s floating high above the trenches were used as stationary observation posts, reporting enemy troop positions and directing artillery fire. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, each equipped with [[parachute]]s: upon an enemy air attack on the flammable balloon, the crew would jump to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots in aircraft, and smaller versions would not be developed until the end of the war. (In the British case, there arose concerns that they might undermine [[morale]], effectively encouraging [[cowardice]].) Recognized for their value as observer platforms, observation balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft. To defend against air attack, they were heavily protected by large concentrations of anti-aircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft.\n\nWhile early air spotters were unarmed, they soon began firing at each other with handheld weapons. An arms race commenced, quickly leading to increasingly agile planes equipped with machine guns. A key innovation was the [[synchronization gear|interrupter gear]], a Dutch invention<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1369.htm|title=No. 1369: Fokker's Interrupter Mechanism|website=www.uh.edu}}</ref> that allowed a machine gun to be mounted behind the propeller so the pilot could fire directly ahead, along the plane's flight path.\n\nAs the stalemate developed on the ground, with both sides unable to advance even a few miles without a major battle and thousands of casualties, planes became greatly valued for their role gathering intelligence on enemy positions. They also bombed enemy supplies behind the trench lines, in the manner of later [[attack aircraft]]. Large planes with a pilot and an observer were used to reconnoiter enemy positions and bomb their supply bases. These large and slow planes made easy targets for enemy fighter planes, who in turn were met by [[fighter escort]]s and spectacular aerial dogfights.\n\n[[German strategic bombing during World War I]] struck Warsaw, Paris, London and other cities. Germany led the world in [[Zeppelin]]s, and used these airships to make occasional bombing raids on military targets, London and other British cities, without great effect. Later in the war, Germany introduced long range [[strategic bomber]]s. Damage was again minor but they forced the British air forces to maintain squadrons of fighters in England to defend against air attack, depriving the British Expeditionary Force of planes, equipment, and personnel badly needed on the Western front.\n\nThe Allies made much smaller efforts in bombing the Central Powers.\n\n== Mobility ==\n[[File:Belgian corps in Russia.jpg|thumb|[[Minerva (automobile)|Mors-Minerva]] armored car of the [[Belgian Expeditionary Corps in Russia]], {{circa}} January 1916]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]] armed with machine guns were organized into combat units, along with [[Bicycle infantry|cyclist infantry]] and [[Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade|machine guns mounted on motor cycle sidecars]]. Though not able to assault entrenched positions, they provided mobile fire support to infantry, and performed scouting, reconnaissance, and other roles similar to cavalry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/mmg.htm|title=Motor Machine-gun units|date=2008-06-22|website=Via Wayback Machine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622183109/http://www.1914-1918.net/mmg.htm|archive-date=2008-06-22|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> After trench warfare took hold of major battle-lines, opportunities for such vehicles greatly diminished, though they continued to see use in the more open campaigns in Russia and the Middle East.\n\nBetween late 1914 and early 1918, the Western Front hardly moved. When the [[Russian Empire]] surrendered after the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, Germany was able to move many troops to the Western Front. With new [[stormtrooper]] infantry trained in [[infiltration tactics]] to exploit enemy weak points and penetrate into rear areas, they launched a [[Spring Offensive|series of offensives in the spring of 1918]]. In the largest of these, [[Operation Michael]], General [[Oskar von Hutier]] pushed forward 60 kilometers, gaining in a couple weeks what France and Britain had spent years to achieve. Although initially successful tactically, these offensives stalled after outrunning their horse-drawn supply, artillery, and reserves, leaving German forces weakened and exhausted.\n\nIn the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] of August 1918, the Triple Entente forces began a counterattack that would be called the \"[[Hundred Days Offensive]].\" The Australian and Canadian divisions that spearheaded the attack managed to advance 13 kilometers on the first day alone. These battles marked the end of trench warfare on the Western Front and a return to mobile warfare. \n\nThe [[mobile personnel shield]] was a less successful attempt at restoring mobility.<ref name=\"Gougaud, p.110\">Gougaud, p.110</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the defeated Germans would seek to combine their infantry-based mobile warfare of 1918 with vehicles, eventually leading to ''[[blitzkrieg]]'', or \"lightning warfare.\"\n\n=== Tanks ===\n{{Main|Tanks in World War I}}\n[[File:Lot-7868-8 (28364510440).jpg|thumb|[[Renault FT]]s in U.S. service, Juvigny, France]]\nAlthough the concept of the [[tank]] had been suggested as early as the 1890s, authorities showed little more than a passing interest in them until the trench stalemate of World War I caused reconsideration. In early 1915, the British [[Royal Navy]] and French industrialists both started dedicated development of tanks.\n\nBasic tank design combined several existing technologies. It included [[vehicle armor|armor plating]] thick enough to be proof against all standard infantry arms, [[caterpillar track]] (invented in 1770 and perfected in the early 1900s) for mobility over the shell-torn battlefield, the four-stroke gasoline powered [[internal combustion engine]] (refined in the 1870s), and heavy firepower, provided by the same machine guns which had recently become so dominant in warfare, or even light artillery guns.\n\nIn Britain, a landships committee was formed, teamed with the inventions committee, and assigned the task working out a practical tank design. The \"landship\" focus led to large tanks with a [[rhomboidal]] shape to allow crossing of an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} trench, starting with the [[Mark I tank]], with the \"male\" versions mounting [[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss|small naval guns]].\n\nIn France, several competing arms industry organizations each proposed radically different designs. Smaller tanks became favored, leading to the [[Renault FT tank]], in part by being able to leverage the engines and manufacturing techniques of commercial tractors and automobiles.\n\nThough their initial appearance on the battlefield in 1917 terrified the Germans, these engagements provided more opportunities for development than battle successes. Early tanks were unreliable, breaking down often. Germans learned they were vulnerable to direct hits from field artillery and heavy mortars, their trenches were widened and other obstacles devised to halt them, and special [[anti-tank rifle]]s were rapidly developed. Also, both Britain and France found new tactics and training were required to make effective use of their tanks, such as larger coordinated formations of tanks and close support with infantry. Once tanks could be organized in the hundreds, as in the opening assault of the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, they began to have notable impact.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the war, new tank designs often revealed flaws in battle, to be addressed in later designs, but reliability remained the primary weakness of tanks. In the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]], a major [[Triple Entente|Entente]] counteroffensive near the end of the war, British forces went to field with 532 tanks; after several days, only a few were still in commission, with those that suffered mechanical difficulties outnumbering those disabled by enemy fire.\n\nGermany utilized many captured enemy tanks, and made a few of their own late in the war. \n\nIn the last year of the war, despite rapidly increasing production (especially by France) and improving designs, tank technology struggled to make more than a modest impact on the war's overall progress. [[Plan 1919]] proposed the future use of massive tank formations in great offensives combined with [[ground attack aircraft]].\n\nEven without achieving the decisive results hoped for during World War I, tank technology and [[mechanized warfare]] had been launched and would grow increasingly sophisticated in the years following the war. By [[World War II]], the tank would evolve into a fearsome weapon critical to restoring mobility to land warfare.<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=421\u2013426}}</ref>\n\n== At sea ==\n{{Main|Naval warfare of World War I}}\n \nThe years leading up to the war saw the use of improved metallurgical and mechanical techniques to produce larger ships with larger guns and, in reaction, more armor. The launching of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)]] revolutionized [[battleship]] construction, leaving many ships obsolete before they were completed. German ambitions brought an [[Anglo-German naval arms race]] in which the [[Imperial German Navy]] was built up from a small force to the world's most modern and second most powerful. However, even this high-technology navy entered the war with a mix of newer ships and obsolete older ones.\n\nThe advantage was in long-range gunnery, and naval battles took place at far greater distances than before. The 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]] demonstrated the excellence of German ships and crews, but also showed that the [[High Seas Fleet]] was not big enough to challenge openly the British [[blockade of Germany]]. It was the only full-scale battle between fleets in the war.\n\nHaving the largest surface fleet, the United Kingdom sought to press its advantage. British ships blockaded German ports, hunted down German and Austro-Hungarian ships wherever they might be on the high seas, and supported actions against [[German colonies]]. The German surface fleet was largely kept in the North Sea. This situation pushed Germany, in particular, to direct its resources to a new form of naval power: submarines.\n\n[[Naval mine]]s were deployed in hundreds of thousands, or far greater numbers than in previous wars. Submarines proved surprisingly effective for this purpose. [[Influence mine]]s were a new development but moored contact mines were the most numerous. They resembled those of the late 19th century, improved so they less often exploded while being laid. The Allies produced enough mines to build the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]] to help bottle the Germans into the [[North Sea]], but it was too late to make much difference.\n\n=== Submarines ===\n[[File:Submarine U-14 (LOC) (6358166395).jpg|thumb|German U-boat ''[[SM U-14 (Germany)|U-14]]'']]\nWorld War I was the first conflict in which [[submarine]]s were a serious weapon of war. In the years shortly before the war, the relatively sophisticated propulsion system of diesel power while surfaced and battery power while submerged was introduced. Their armament had similarly improved, but few were in service. Germany had already increased production, and quickly built up its [[U-boat]] fleet, both for action against British warships and for a counterblockade of the British Isles. 360 were eventually built. The resulting [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)]] destroyed more enemy warships than the High Seas Fleet had, and hampered British war supplies as the more expensive surface fleet had not.\n\nThe United Kingdom relied heavily on imports to feed its population and supply its war industry, and the German Navy hoped to blockade and starve Britain using [[U-boats]] to attack merchant ships. Lieutenant [[Otto Weddigen]] remarked of the [[Action of 22 September 1914|second submarine attack of the Great War]]:\n\n:{{cquote|How much they feared our submarines and how wide was the agitation caused by good little [[SM U-9|U-9]] is shown by the English reports that a whole flotilla of German submarines had attacked the cruisers and that this flotilla had approached under cover of the flag of Holland. These reports were absolutely untrue. U-9 was the only submarine on deck, and she flew the flag she still flies \u2013 the German naval ensign.}}\n\nSubmarines soon came under persecution by [[submarine chaser]]s and other small warships using hastily devised [[anti-submarine weapons]]. They could not impose an effective blockade while acting under the restrictions of the [[prize rules]] and international [[law of the sea]]. They resorted to [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], which cost Germany public sympathy in neutral countries and was a factor contributing to the [[American entry into World War I]].\n\nThis struggle between German submarines and British counter measures became known as the \"[[First Battle of the Atlantic]].\" As German submarines became more numerous and effective, the British sought ways to protect their merchant ships. \"[[Q-ship]]s,\" attack vessels disguised as civilian ships, were one early strategy.\n\nConsolidating merchant ships into [[convoys]] protected by one or more armed navy vessels was adopted later in the war. There was initially a great deal of debate about this approach, out of fear that it would provide German U-boats with a wealth of convenient targets. Thanks to the development of active and passive [[sonar]] devices,<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|pp=129, 130, 140}}</ref> coupled with increasingly deadly [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, the convoy system reduced British losses to U-boats to a small fraction of their former level.\n\n[[Holland 602 type submarine]]<nowiki/>s and other Allied types were fewer, being unnecessary for the blockade of Germany.\n\n== Small arms ==\n[[File:French troopers under General Gouraud, with their machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the Marne... - NARA - 533679.tif|thumb|French machine gunners defend a ruined cathedral, late in the war]]\n[[List of infantry weapons of World War I|Infantry weapons]] for major powers were mainly [[bolt action]] rifles, capable of firing ten or more rounds per minute. German soldiers carried [[Gewehr 98]] rifle in 8mm mauser, while the British carried the [[Short Magazine Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifle.<ref>Bull, Stephen  (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare''; (1): 1914-16.

London: Pantheon Books, Random House; p. 69</ref>\n\n[[Machine guns]] were also used by great powers; both sides used the [[Maxim gun]], a fully automatic [[belt-fed]] weapon, capable of long-term sustained use provided it was supplied to adequate amounts of ammunition and cooling water, and its French counterpart, the [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun]].<ref>Bull, Stephen (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare; (1): 1914-16. Oxford: Osprey Publishing; pp. 11-12</ref> Their use in defense, combined with barbed [[wire obstacle]]s, converted the expected [[Maneuver warfare|mobile battlefield]] to a static one. The machine gun was useful in [[Trench warfare|stationary battle]] but could not move easily through a battlefield, and therefore forced soldiers to face enemy machine guns without machine guns of their own.\n\nBefore the war, the French Army studied the question of a [[light machine gun]] but had made none for use. At the start of hostilities, France quickly turned an existing prototype (the \"CS\" for Chauchat and Sutter) into the lightweight [[Chauchat|Chauchat M1915]] automatic rifle with a high [[rate of fire]]. Besides its use by the French, the first American units to arrive in France used it in 1917 and 1918. Hastily mass-manufactured under desperate wartime pressures, the weapon developed a reputation for unreliability.<ref name=TrenchWarfare>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXCn3WrINjwC&pg=PA31 |pages=31\u201332 |title=World War I Trench Warfare (1916\u20131918) |last1=Bull |first1=Stephen |last2=Hook |first2=Adam |publisher=Osprey |year=2002 |isbn=1-84176-198-2 |series=Elite |volume=84 |edition=3}}</ref>\n\nSeeing the potential of such a weapon, the British Army adopted the American-designed [[Lewis gun]] chambered in .303 British.

When the war started, grenades were few and poor. Hand grenades were used and improved throughout the war. [[Contact fuze]]s became less common, replaced by time fuzes.\n\nThe British entered the war with the long-handled impact detonating \"[[No 1 grenade|Grenade, Hand No 1]]\".<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\">Bull, Stephen (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare; (1): 1914-16''. Oxford: Osprey Publishing; p. 27</ref> This was replaced by the [[No. 15 ball grenade|No. 15 \"Ball Grenade\"]] to partially overcome some of its inadequacies. An [[Improvised explosive device|improvised]] hand grenade was developed in Australia for use by ANZAC troops called the [[Jam Tin Grenade|Double Cylinder \"jam tin\"]] which consisted of a tin filled with [[dynamite]] or [[guncotton]], packed round with scrap metal or stones. To ignite, at the top of the tin there was a Bickford [[safety fuse]] connecting the detonator, which was lit by either the user, or a second person.<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\"/> The \"[[Mills bomb]]\" (Grenade, Hand No. 5) was introduced in 1915 and would serve in its basic form in the British Army until the 1970s. Its improved fusing system relied on the soldier removing a pin and while holding down a lever on the side of the grenade. When the grenade was thrown the safety lever would automatically release, igniting the grenades internal fuse which would burn down until the grenade detonated. The French would use the [[F1 grenade (France)|F1]] defensive grenade.\n\nThe major grenades used in the beginning by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] were the impact-detonating \"[[Discus throw|discus]]\" or \"oyster shell\" bomb and the Mod 1913 black powder ''[[Kugelhandgranate]]'' with a friction-ignited time fuse.<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\"/> In 1915 Germany developed the much more effective ''[[Stielhandgranate]]'', nicknamed \"potato masher\" for its shape, whose variants remained in use for decades; it used a timed fuse system similar to the Mills bomb. \n\nHand grenades were not the only attempt at projectile explosives for infantry. A [[rifle grenade]] was brought into the trenches to attack the enemy from a greater distance. The [[Hales rifle grenade]] got little attention from the British Army before the war began but, during the war, Germany showed great interest in this weapon. The resulting casualties for the Allies caused Britain to search for a new defense.<ref>Bull, Stephen (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare; (1): 1914-16''. Oxford: Osprey Publishing; p. 29</ref>\n\nThe [[Stokes mortar]], a lightweight and very portable [[trench mortar]] with short tube and capable of [[indirect fire]], was rapidly developed and widely imitated.<ref>Duffy, Michael (2000-07) \"Safe Surf\". http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/mortars.htm</ref> Mechanical bomb throwers of lesser range were used in a similar fashion to fire upon the enemy from a safe distance within the trench.\n\nThe [[Sauterelle]] was a grenade launching [[Crossbow]] used before the Stokes mortar by French and British troops.\n\n==Flame throwers==\n[[File:PSM V87 D315 Flame thrower used by the germans to repulse attacks in ww 1.png|thumb|Defensive use]]\nThe Imperial German Army deployed [[flame thrower]]s (''Flammenwerfer'') on the Western Front attempting to flush out French or British soldiers from their trenches. Introduced in 1915, it was used with greatest effect during the [[Hooge, Belgium|Hooge]] battle of the Western Front on 30 July 1915. The German Army had two main types of flame throwers during the Great War: a small single person version called the [[Kleinflammenwerfer]] and a larger crew served configuration called the [[Grossflammenwerfer]]. In the latter, one soldier carried the fuel tank while another aimed the nozzle. Both the large and smaller versions of the flame-thrower were of limited use because their short range left the operator(s) exposed to small arms fire.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of German weapons of World War I]]\n* [[Romanian military equipment of World War I]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Johnson, Jeffrey: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/science_and_technology Science and Technology] , in: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/home.html 1914-1918-online.

This trend began at least fifty years prior to [[World War I]] during the [[American Civil War]] of 1861\u20131865,<ref>\nCompare: {{cite book\n| last1                 = Boot\n| first1                = Max\n| author-link1          = Max Boot\n| chapter               = The Consequences of the Industrial Revolution\n| title                 = War Made New: Weapons, Warriors, and the Making of the Modern World\n| url                   = https://books.google.com/books?id=AvS52cUqjHsC\n| edition               = reprint\n| location              = New York\n| publisher             = Penguin Publishing Group\n| publication-date      = 2006\n| page                  = \n| isbn                  = 9781101216835\n| accessdate            = 2017-01-24\n| quote                 = The First Industrial Revolution transformed warfare between the end of the Crimean War (1856) and the start of World War I (1914)\n}}\n</ref>\nand continued through many smaller conflicts in which soldiers and strategists tested new weapons.\n\n[[File:Grabenkeulen IMG 1703.JPG|thumb|British improvised weapons in [[Fort Reuenthal]]]]\nWorld War I weapons included types standardised and improved over the preceding period, together with some newly developed types using innovative [[technology]] and a number of [[improvised weapon]]s used in trench warfare. [[Military technology]] of the time included important innovations in [[machine gun]]s, [[grenade]]s, and artillery, along with essentially new weapons such as [[submarine]]s, [[Chemical weapons in World War I|poison gas]], [[warplane]]s and [[Tanks in World War I|tanks]].<ref>Tucker, Spencer C. (1998) ''The Great War: 1914-18''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press; p. 11</ref>\n\nOne could characterize the earlier years of the First World War as a clash of 20th-century [[technology]] with 19th-century [[military science]] creating ineffective battles with huge numbers of casualties on both sides. On land, only in the final year of the war did the major armies make effective steps in revolutionizing matters of command and control and tactics to adapt to the modern battlefield and start to harness the myriad new technologies to effective military purposes. Tactical reorganizations (such as shifting the focus of command from the 100+ man [[Company (military unit)|company]] to the 10+ man [[squad]]) went hand-in-hand with armored cars, the first submachine guns, and automatic rifles that a single individual soldier could carry and use.\n\n== Trench warfare ==\n{{Main|Trench warfare}}\nThe new metallurgical and chemical industries created new firepower that briefly simplified defense before new approaches to [[Offensive (military)|attack]] evolved. The application of infantry [[rifle]]s, rifled [[artillery]] with [[hydraulic recoil mechanism]]s, zigzag trenches and [[machine gun]]s made it difficult or nearly impossible to cross defended ground. The [[hand grenade]], long used in crude form, developed rapidly as an aid in attacking trenches. Probably the most important was the introduction of [[Shell (projectile)#High-explosive|high explosive shells]], which dramatically increased the [[lethality]] of artillery over the 19th-century equivalents.\n\nTrench warfare led to the development of the concrete [[Pillbox (military)|pill box]], a small, hardened blockhouse that could be used to deliver machine gun fire. Pillboxes could be placed across a battlefield with interlocking fields of fire.<ref>{{Citation \n |author1=March, F. A. |author2=Beamish, R. J. | year=1919\n | title=History  of the World War: An Authentic Narrative of the World's Greatest War\n | publisher=Leslie-Judge }}</ref>\n\nBecause attacking an entrenched enemy was so difficult, [[tunnel warfare]] became a major effort during the war. Once enemy positions were undermined, huge amounts of explosives would be planted and detonated as part preparation for an overland charge. Sensitive listening devices that could detect the sounds of digging were a crucial method of defense against these underground incursions. The British proved especially adept at these tactics, thanks to the skill of their tunnel-digging \"[[sapper]]s\" and the sophistication of their listening devices.\n\nDuring the First World War, the static movement of [[trench warfare]] and a need for protection from [[sniper]]s created a requirement for [[Loophole (firearm)|loopholes]] both for discharging firearms and for observation.<ref name=\"One\">[https://ww1revisited.com/2014/03/16/trench-loopholes-le-linge/ Trench Loopholes, Le Linge]</ref>  Often a steel plate was used with a \"key hole\", which had a rotating piece to cover the loophole when not in use.<ref name=\"One\" />\n\n=== Clothing ===\n[[File:Temporary exhibition about WWI, gare de Paris-Est, 2014 (German helmets).jpg|thumb|German helmets went from leather to steel]]\nThe British and German armies had already changed from [[red coat (British army)]] (1902) or [[Prussian blue]] (1910) for field uniforms, to less conspicuous [[khaki]] or [[field gray]]. [[Adolphe Messimy]], [[Joseph Gallieni]] and other French leaders had proposed following suit, but the French army marched to war in their traditional red trousers, and only began receiving the new \"[[French Army in World War I#Uniforms|horizon blue]]\" ones in 1915.\n\nA type of raincoat for British officers, introduced long before the war, gained fame as the [[trench coat]].\n\nThe principal armies entered the war under cloth caps or leather helmets. They hastened to develop new [[steel helmet]]s, in designs that became icons of their respective countries.\n\n== Artillery ==\n{{Further|Artillery of World War I}}\n\n[[File:Cannon 75 mm Schneider with limber Memorial de Verdun.JPG|thumb|French [[Canon de 75 mod\u00e8le 1897]] gave quick, accurate fire in a small, agile unit, but the Western Front often needed longer range]]\n[[Image:7.7 cm FK 16 CMHM Brantford 1.JPG|right|thumb|German [[7.7 cm FK 16]], developed during the war because an earlier model had insufficient range]]\n[[File:Austro-Hungarian artillery 1914.jpg|thumb|Austro-Hungarian artillery 1914]]\nIn the 19th century, Britain and France exploited the rapid technical developments in [[artillery]] to serve a [[War of Movement]]. Such weapons served well in the colonial wars of that century, and served Germany very well in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], but trench warfare was more like a [[siege]], and called for [[siege gun]]s. The German army had already anticipated that a European war might require heavier artillery, hence had a more appropriate mix of sizes. Foundries responded to the actual situation with more heavy products and fewer highly mobile pieces. Germany developed the [[Paris gun]]s of stupendous size and range. However, the necessarily stupendous [[muzzle velocity]] wore out a gun barrel after a few shots requiring a return to the factory for relining, so these weapons served more to frighten and anger urban people than to kill them or devastate their cities.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, artillery was often sited in the front line to fire over open sights at enemy infantry. During the war, the following improvements were made:\n\n* The first \"box [[barrage (artillery)|barrage]]\" in history was fired in the [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] in 1915; this was the use of a three- or four-sided curtain of shell-fire to prevent the movement of enemy infantry\n* The wire-cutting [[No. 106 fuze]] was developed, specifically designed to explode on contact with barbed wire, or the ground before the shell buried itself in mud, and equally effective as an [[anti-personnel]] weapon\n* The first [[anti-aircraft gun]]s were devised out of necessity\n* Indirect [[counter-battery fire]] was developed for the first time \n* [[Artillery sound ranging]] and [[flash spotting]], for the location and eventual destruction of enemy batteries\n* The [[creeping barrage]] was perfected\n* Factors such as weather, air temperature, and barrel wear could for the first time be accurately measured and taken into account for [[indirect fire]]\n* [[Forward observer]]s were used to direct artillery positioned out of direct line of sight from the targets, and sophisticated communications and fire plans were developed\n\n[[Field artillery]] entered the war with the idea that each gun should be accompanied by hundreds of shells, and armories ought to have about a thousand on hand for resupply. This proved utterly inadequate when it became commonplace for a gun to sit in one place and fire a hundred shells or more per day for weeks or months on end. To meet the resulting [[Shell Crisis of 1915]], factories were hastily converted from other purposes to make more ammunition. Railways to the front were expanded or built, leaving the question of the [[last mile]]. [[Horses in World War I]] were the main answer, and their high death rate seriously weakened the Central Powers late in the war. In many places the newly invented [[trench railway]]s helped. The new motor [[truck]]s as yet lacked pneumatic tires, versatile suspension, and other improvements that in later decades would allow them to perform well.\n\nThe majority of casualties inflicted during the war were the result of artillery fire.\n\n== Poison gas ==\n{{Main|Poison gas in World War I}}\n[[Image:Australian infantry small box respirators Ypres 1917.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Australian infantry with gas masks, [[Ypres]], 1917.]]\n[[Chemical weapon]]s were first used systematically in this war. [[Chemical weapons in World War I]] included [[phosgene]], [[tear gas]], [[Adamsite|chlorarsine]]s and [[mustard gas]].\n\nAt the beginning of the war, Germany had the most advanced chemical industry in the world, accounting for more than 80% of the world's dye and chemical production. Although the use of poison gas had been banned by the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], [[Germany]] turned to this industry for what it hoped would be a decisive weapon to break the deadlock of trench warfare. [[Chlorine]] gas was first used on the battlefield in April 1915 at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] in [[Belgium]]. The unknown gas appeared to be a simple [[smoke screen]], used to hide attacking soldiers, and Allied troops were ordered to the front trenches to repel the expected attack. The gas had a devastating effect, killing many defenders or when the wind direction changed and blew the gas back, many attackers. Because the gas killed the attackers, depending on the wind, a more reliable way had to be made to transmit the gas. It began being delivered in artillery shells.<ref>[[Chemical weapons in World War I]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=May 2018}} Later, [[mustard gas]], [[phosgene]] and other gases were used. Britain and France soon followed suit with their own gas weapons. The first defenses against gas were makeshift, mainly rags soaked in water or [[urine]]. Later, relatively effective [[gas mask]]s were developed, and these greatly reduced the effectiveness of gas as a weapon. Although it sometimes resulted in brief tactical advantages and probably caused over 1,000,000 casualties, gas seemed to have had no significant effect on the course of the war.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nChemical weapons were easily attained, and cheap. Gas was especially effective against troops in trenches and bunkers that protected them from other weapons. Chemical weapons attacked an individual's respiratory system. The concept of choking easily caused fear in soldiers and the resulting terror affected them psychologically. Because there was such a great fear of chemical weapons it was not uncommon that a soldier would panic and misinterpret symptoms of the common cold as being affected by a poisonous gas.\n\n== Command and control ==\n{{Main|Command and control}}\n\nIn the early days of the war, generals tried to direct tactics from headquarters many miles from the front, with messages being carried back and forth by [[courier]]s on motorcycles. It was soon realized that more immediate methods of communication were needed.\n\n[[Radio]] sets of the period were too heavy to carry into battle, and [[field telephone]] lines laid were quickly broken. Runners, flashing lights, and mirrors were often used instead; dogs were also used, though they were only used occasionally as troops tended to adopt them as pets and men would volunteer to go as runners in the dog's place. There were also [[Aviation in World War I|aircraft]] (called \"contact patrols\") that carried messages between headquarters and forward positions, sometimes dropping their messages without landing.\n\nThe new long-range artillery developed just before the war now had to fire at positions it could not see. Typical tactics were to pound the enemy front lines and then stop to let infantry move forward, hoping that the enemy line was broken, though it rarely was. The lifting and then the [[barrage (artillery)#Development of the creeping barrage|creeping barrage]] were developed to keep artillery fire landing directly in front of the infantry \"as it advanced.\" Communications being impossible, the danger was that the barrage would move too fast \u2014 losing the protection \u2014 or too slowly \u2014 holding up the advance.\n\nThere were also countermeasures to these artillery tactics: by aiming a counter barrage directly behind an enemy's creeping barrage, one could target the infantry that was following the creeping barrage. Microphones ([[Sound ranging]]) were used to triangulate the position of enemy guns and engage in [[counter-battery fire]]. Muzzle flashes of guns could also be spotted and used to target enemy artillery.\n\n== Railways ==\n{{wide image|Wrecked ammunition train3.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|German ammunition train wrecked by shell fire, c. 1918.}}\n[[File:Somme -- French Auto in mud LOC 15276629134.jpg|thumb|Motor trucks rarely performed well]]\nRailways dominated in this war as in no other. [[Schlieffen Plan|The German strategy]] was known beforehand by the Allies simply because of the vast marshaling yards on the Belgian border that had no other purpose than to deliver the mobilized German army to its start point. The German mobilization plan was little more than a vast detailed railway timetable. Men and material could get to the front at an unprecedented rate by rail, but trains were vulnerable at the front itself. Thus, armies could only advance at the pace that they could build or rebuild a railway, e.g. [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|the British advance across Sinai]]. Motorized transport was only extensively used in the last two years of World War I. After the rail head, troops moved the [[last mile]] on foot, and guns and supplies were drawn by horses and [[trench railways]]. Railways lacked the flexibility of motor transport and this lack of flexibility percolated through into the conduct of the war.\n\n== War of attrition ==\nThe countries involved in the war applied the full force of industrial mass-production to the manufacture of weapons and ammunition, especially artillery shells. [[Female roles in the World Wars|Women on the home-front]] played a crucial role in this by working in munitions factories. This complete mobilization of a nation's resources, or \"[[total war]]\" meant that not only the armies, but also the economies of the warring nations were in competition.\n\nFor a time, in 1914\u20131915, some hoped that the war could be won through an attrition of [[materiel]]\u2014that the enemy's supply of artillery shells could be exhausted in futile exchanges. But production was ramped up on both sides and hopes proved futile. In Britain the [[Shell Crisis of 1915]] brought down the British government, and led to the building of [[HM Factory, Gretna]], a huge munitions factory on the English-Scottish border.\n\nThe [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] then focused on another resource: human lives. In the [[Battle of Verdun]] in particular, German Chief of Staff [[Erich Von Falkenhayn]] hoped to \"bleed France white\" through repeated attacks on this French city.\n\nIn the end, the war ended through a combination of attrition (of men and material), advances on the battlefield, arrival of American troops in large numbers, and a breakdown of morale and production on the [[Home front during World War I#Germany|German home-front]] due to an effective [[naval blockade]] of her seaports.\n\n== Air warfare ==\n{{Main|Aviation in World War I}}\n[[Image:Fokker Dr1 on the ground.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The [[Fokker Dr.I|Fokker triplane]] belonging to [[Manfred von Richthofen]] (the \"Red Baron\")]]\n\n[[Aviation in World War I]] started with primitive aircraft, primitively used. Technological progress was swift, leading to ground attack, [[tactical bombing]], and highly publicized, deadly [[dogfight]]s among aircraft equipped with forward-firing, [[Synchronization gear|synchronized]] [[machine gun]]s [[Synchronization gear#The Fokker Stangensteuerung gear|from July 1915]] onwards. However, these uses made a lesser impact on the war than more mundane roles in intelligence, sea patrol and especially [[artillery spotting]]. [[Antiaircraft warfare]] also had its beginnings in this war.\n\nAs with most technologies, aircraft and their use underwent many improvements during World War I. As the initial war of movement on the Western Front settled into trench warfare, [[aerial reconnaissance]] over the front added to the difficulty of mounting surprise attacks against entrenched and concealed defenders.\n\nManned [[observation balloon]]s floating high above the trenches were used as stationary observation posts, reporting enemy troop positions and directing artillery fire. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, each equipped with [[parachute]]s: upon an enemy air attack on the flammable balloon, the crew would jump to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots in aircraft, and smaller versions would not be developed until the end of the war. (In the British case, there arose concerns that they might undermine [[morale]], effectively encouraging [[cowardice]].) Recognized for their value as observer platforms, observation balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft. To defend against air attack, they were heavily protected by large concentrations of antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft.\n\nWhile early air spotters were unarmed, they soon began firing at each other with handheld weapons. An arms race commenced, quickly leading to increasingly agile planes equipped with machine guns. A key innovation was the [[synchronization gear|interrupter gear]], a Dutch invention<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi1369.htm|title=No. 1369: Fokker's Interrupter Mechanism|website=www.uh.edu}}</ref> that allowed a machine gun to be mounted behind the propeller so the pilot could fire directly ahead, along the plane's flight path.\n\nAs the stalemate developed on the ground, with both sides unable to advance even a few miles without a major battle and thousands of casualties, planes became greatly valued for their role gathering intelligence on enemy positions. They also bombed enemy supplies behind the trench lines, in the manner of later [[attack aircraft]]. Large planes with a pilot and an observer were used to reconnoiter enemy positions and bomb their supply bases. These large and slow planes made easy targets for enemy fighter planes, who in turn were met by [[fighter escort]]s and spectacular aerial dogfights.\n\n[[German strategic bombing during World War I]] struck Warsaw, Paris, London and other cities. Germany led the world in [[Zeppelin]]s, and used these airships to make occasional bombing raids on military targets, London and other British cities, without great effect. Later in the war, Germany introduced long range [[strategic bomber]]s. Damage was again minor but they forced the British air forces to maintain squadrons of fighters in England to defend against air attack, depriving the British Expeditionary Force of planes, equipment, and personnel badly needed on the Western front.\n\nThe Allies made much smaller efforts in bombing the Central Powers.\n\n== Mobility ==\n[[File:Belgian corps in Russia.jpg|thumb|[[Minerva (automobile)|Mors-Minerva]] armored car of the [[Belgian Expeditionary Corps in Russia]], {{circa}} January 1916]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]] armed with machine guns were organized into combat units, along with [[Bicycle infantry|cyclist infantry]] and [[Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade|machine guns mounted on motor cycle sidecars]]. Though not able to assault entrenched positions, they provided mobile fire support to infantry, and performed scouting, reconnaissance, and other roles similar to cavalry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.1914-1918.net/mmg.htm|title=Motor Machine-gun units|date=2008-06-22|website=Via Wayback Machine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622183109/http://www.1914-1918.net/mmg.htm|archive-date=2008-06-22|url-status=dead|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> After trench warfare took hold of major battle-lines, opportunities for such vehicles greatly diminished, though they continued to see use in the more open campaigns in Russia and the Middle East.\n\nBetween late 1914 and early 1918, the Western Front hardly moved. When the [[Russian Empire]] surrendered after the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, Germany was able to move many troops to the Western Front. With new [[stormtrooper]] infantry trained in [[infiltration tactics]] to exploit enemy weak points and penetrate into rear areas, they launched a [[Spring Offensive|series of offensives in the spring of 1918]]. In the largest of these, [[Operation Michael]], General [[Oskar von Hutier]] pushed forward 60 kilometers, gaining in a couple weeks what France and Britain had spent years to achieve. Although initially successful tactically, these offensives stalled after outrunning their horse-drawn supply, artillery, and reserves, leaving German forces weakened and exhausted.\n\nIn the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] of August 1918, the Triple Entente forces began a counterattack that would be called the \"[[Hundred Days Offensive]].\" The Australian and Canadian divisions that spearheaded the attack managed to advance 13 kilometers on the first day alone. These battles marked the end of trench warfare on the Western Front and a return to mobile warfare. \n\nThe [[mobile personnel shield]] was a less successful attempt at restoring mobility.<ref name=\"Gougaud, p.110\">Gougaud, p.110</ref>\n\nAfter the war, the defeated Germans would seek to combine their infantry-based mobile warfare of 1918 with vehicles, eventually leading to ''[[blitzkrieg]]'', or \"lightning warfare.\"\n\n=== Tanks ===\n{{Main|Tanks in World War I}}\n[[File:Lot-7868-8 (28364510440).jpg|thumb|[[Renault FT]]s in U.S. service, Juvigny, France]]\nAlthough the concept of the [[tank]] had been suggested as early as the 1890s, authorities showed little more than a passing interest in them until the trench stalemate of World War I caused reconsideration. In early 1915, the British [[Royal Navy]] and French industrialists both started dedicated development of tanks.\n\nBasic tank design combined several existing technologies. It included [[vehicle armor|armor plating]] thick enough to be proof against all standard infantry arms, [[caterpillar track]] (invented in 1770 and perfected in the early 1900s) for mobility over the shell-torn battlefield, the four-stroke gasoline powered [[internal combustion engine]] (refined in the 1870s), and heavy firepower, provided by the same machine guns which had recently become so dominant in warfare, or even light artillery guns.\n\nIn Britain, a landships committee was formed, teamed with the inventions committee, and assigned the task working out a practical tank design. The \"landship\" focus led to large tanks with a [[rhomboidal]] shape to allow crossing of an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} trench, starting with the [[Mark I tank]], with the \"male\" versions mounting [[QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss|small naval guns]].\n\nIn France, several competing arms industry organizations each proposed radically different designs. Smaller tanks became favored, leading to the [[Renault FT tank]], in part by being able to leverage the engines and manufacturing techniques of commercial tractors and automobiles.\n\nThough their initial appearance on the battlefield in 1917 terrified the Germans, these engagements provided more opportunities for development than battle successes. Early tanks were unreliable, breaking down often. Germans learned they were vulnerable to direct hits from field artillery and heavy mortars, their trenches were widened and other obstacles devised to halt them, and special [[anti-tank rifle]]s were rapidly developed. Also, both Britain and France found new tactics and training were required to make effective use of their tanks, such as larger coordinated formations of tanks and close support with infantry. Once tanks could be organized in the hundreds, as in the opening assault of the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, they began to have notable impact.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the war, new tank designs often revealed flaws in battle, to be addressed in later designs, but reliability remained the primary weakness of tanks. In the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]], a major [[Triple Entente|Entente]] counteroffensive near the end of the war, British forces went to field with 532 tanks; after several days, only a few were still in commission, with those that suffered mechanical difficulties outnumbering those disabled by enemy fire.\n\nGermany utilized many captured enemy tanks, and made a few of their own late in the war. \n\nIn the last year of the war, despite rapidly increasing production (especially by France) and improving designs, tank technology struggled to make more than a modest impact on the war's overall progress. [[Plan 1919]] proposed the future use of massive tank formations in great offensives combined with [[ground attack aircraft]].\n\nEven without achieving the decisive results hoped for during World War I, tank technology and [[mechanized warfare]] had been launched and would grow increasingly sophisticated in the years following the war. By [[World War II]], the tank would evolve into a fearsome weapon critical to restoring mobility to land warfare.<ref>{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=421\u2013426}}</ref>\n\n== At sea ==\n{{Main|Naval warfare of World War I}}\n \nThe years leading up to the war saw the use of improved metallurgical and mechanical techniques to produce larger ships with larger guns and, in reaction, more armor. The launching of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)]] revolutionized [[battleship]] construction, leaving many ships obsolete before they were completed. German ambitions brought an [[Anglo-German naval arms race]] in which the [[Imperial German Navy]] was built up from a small force to the world's most modern and second most powerful. However, even this high-technology navy entered the war with a mix of newer ships and obsolete older ones.\n\nThe advantage was in long-range gunnery, and naval battles took place at far greater distances than before. The 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]] demonstrated the excellence of German ships and crews, but also showed that the [[High Seas Fleet]] was not big enough to challenge openly the British [[blockade of Germany]]. It was the only full-scale battle between fleets in the war.\n\nHaving the largest surface fleet, the United Kingdom sought to press its advantage. British ships blockaded German ports, hunted down German and Austro-Hungarian ships wherever they might be on the high seas, and supported actions against [[German colonies]]. The German surface fleet was largely kept in the North Sea. This situation pushed Germany, in particular, to direct its resources to a new form of naval power: submarines.\n\n[[Naval mine]]s were deployed in hundreds of thousands, or far greater numbers than in previous wars. Submarines proved surprisingly effective for this purpose. [[Influence mine]]s were a new development but moored contact mines were the most numerous. They resembled those of the late 19th century, improved so they less often exploded while being laid. The Allies produced enough mines to build the [[North Sea Mine Barrage]] to help bottle the Germans into the [[North Sea]], but it was too late to make much difference.\n\n=== Submarines ===\n[[File:Submarine U-14 (LOC) (6358166395).jpg|thumb|German U-boat ''[[SM U-14 (Germany)|U-14]]'']]\nWorld War I was the first conflict in which [[submarine]]s were a serious weapon of war. In the years shortly before the war, the relatively sophisticated propulsion system of diesel power while surfaced and battery power while submerged was introduced. Their armament had similarly improved, but few were in service. Germany had already increased production, and quickly built up its [[U-boat]] fleet, both for action against British warships and for a counterblockade of the British Isles. 360 were eventually built. The resulting [[U-boat Campaign (World War I)]] destroyed more enemy warships than the High Seas Fleet had, and hampered British war supplies as the more expensive surface fleet had not.\n\nThe United Kingdom relied heavily on imports to feed its population and supply its war industry, and the German Navy hoped to blockade and starve Britain using [[U-boats]] to attack merchant ships. Lieutenant [[Otto Weddigen]] remarked of the [[Action of 22 September 1914|second submarine attack of the Great War]]:\n\n:{{cquote|How much they feared our submarines and how wide was the agitation caused by good little [[SM U-9|U-9]] is shown by the English reports that a whole flotilla of German submarines had attacked the cruisers and that this flotilla had approached under cover of the flag of Holland. These reports were absolutely untrue. U-9 was the only submarine on deck, and she flew the flag she still flies \u2013 the German naval ensign.}}\n\nSubmarines soon came under persecution by [[submarine chaser]]s and other small warships using hastily devised [[anti-submarine weapons]]. They could not impose an effective blockade while acting under the restrictions of the [[prize rules]] and international [[law of the sea]]. They resorted to [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], which cost Germany public sympathy in neutral countries and was a factor contributing to the [[American entry into World War I]].\n\nThis struggle between German submarines and British counter measures became known as the \"[[First Battle of the Atlantic]].\" As German submarines became more numerous and effective, the British sought ways to protect their merchant ships. \"[[Q-ship]]s,\" attack vessels disguised as civilian ships, were one early strategy.\n\nConsolidating merchant ships into [[convoys]] protected by one or more armed navy vessels was adopted later in the war. There was initially a great deal of debate about this approach, out of fear that it would provide German U-boats with a wealth of convenient targets. Thanks to the development of active and passive [[sonar]] devices,<ref>{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|pp=129, 130, 140}}</ref> coupled with increasingly deadly [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, the convoy system reduced British losses to U-boats to a small fraction of their former level.\n\n[[Holland 602 type submarine]]<nowiki/>s and other Allied types were fewer, being unnecessary for the blockade of Germany.\n\n== Small arms ==\n[[File:French troopers under General Gouraud, with their machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the Marne... - NARA - 533679.tif|thumb|French machine gunners defend a ruined cathedral, late in the war]]\n[[List of infantry weapons of World War I|Infantry weapons]] for major powers were mainly [[bolt action]] rifles, capable of firing ten or more rounds per minute.

London: Pantheon Books, Random House; p. 69</ref>\n\n[[Machine guns]] were also used by great powers; both sides used the [[Maxim gun]], a fully automatic [[belt-fed]] weapon, capable of long-term sustained use provided it was supplied to adequate amounts of ammunition and cooling water, and its French counterpart, the [[Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun]].<ref>Bull, Stephen (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare; (1): 1914-16. Oxford: Osprey Publishing; pp. 11-12</ref> Their use in defense, combined with barbed [[wire obstacle]]s, converted the expected [[Maneuver warfare|mobile battlefield]] to a static one. The machine gun was useful in [[Trench warfare|stationary battle]] but could not move easily through a battlefield, and therefore forced soldiers to face enemy machine guns without machine guns of their own.\n\nBefore the war, the French Army studied the question of a [[light machine gun]] but had made none for use. At the start of hostilities, France quickly turned an existing prototype (the \"CS\" for Chauchat and Sutter) into the lightweight [[Chauchat|Chauchat M1915]] automatic rifle with a high [[rate of fire]]. Besides its use by the French, the first American units to arrive in France used it in 1917 and 1918. Hastily mass-manufactured under desperate wartime pressures, the weapon developed a reputation for unreliability.<ref name=TrenchWarfare>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sXCn3WrINjwC&pg=PA31 |pages=31\u201332 |title=World War I Trench Warfare (1916\u20131918) |last1=Bull |first1=Stephen |last2=Hook |first2=Adam |publisher=Osprey |year=2002 |isbn=1-84176-198-2 |series=Elite |volume=84 |edition=3}}</ref>\n\nSeeing the potential of such a weapon, the British Army adopted the American-designed [[Lewis gun]] chambered in .303 British. The Lewis gun was the first true light machine gun that could in theory be operated by one man, though in practice the bulky ammo pans required an entire section of men to keep the gun operating.<ref>P. Griffiths 1994 ''Battle Tactics of the Western Front'' p130</ref> The Lewis Gun was also used for [[marching fire]], notably by the [[Australian Corps]] in the July 1918 [[Battle of Hamel]].<ref name=TrenchWarfare/><ref name=Sheffield>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2tZK2eEqM_gC&pg=PA250 |page=250\n |title=War on the Western Front\n |last=Sheffield |first=G.D. |publisher=Osprey |year=2007\n |isbn=1-84603-210-5}}</ref> To serve the same purpose, the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] adopted the [[MG 08#MG08/15|MG08/15]] which was impractically heavy at {{convert|48.5|lb|kg|0}} counting the water for cooling and one [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] holding 100 rounds.<ref name=Sheffield/> In 1918 the [[M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle]] (BAR) was introduced in the US Army, the weapon was an \"automatic rifle\" and like the Chauchat was designed with the concept of walking fire in mind.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0E9IAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA280 |page=280\n |title=Military science and tactics |year=1920 |volume=2\n |last=Persons |first=William Ernest}}</ref> The tactic was to be employed under conditions of limited field of fire and poor visibility such as advancing through woods.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCUgAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA535 |pages=534\u2013535\n |work=The Military Engineer\n |title=Does the Present Automatic Rifle Meet the Needs of the Rifleman?\n |last=Blain |first=W.A. |date=November\u2013December 1921 |volume=12\u201313 |publisher=Society of American Military Engineers}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/landingforceman00deptgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/landingforceman00deptgoog/page/n457 447] |title=Landing-Force Manual: United States Navy |year=1921 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office}}</ref>\n\nEarly [[submachine guns]] were much used near the end of the war, such as the [[MP-18]].\n\n=== Grenades ===\n[[File:German grenades WWI Memorial de Verdun.JPG|thumb|German grenades from the First World War, [[Verdun Memorial]], [[Fleury-devant-Douaumont]], France]]\n[[Grenades]] proved to be effective weapons in the trenches. When the war started, grenades were few and poor. Hand grenades were used and improved throughout the war. [[Contact fuze]]s became less common, replaced by time fuzes.\n\nThe British entered the war with the long-handled impact detonating \"[[No 1 grenade|Grenade, Hand No 1]]\".<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\">Bull, Stephen (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare; (1): 1914-16''. Oxford: Osprey Publishing; p. 27</ref> This was replaced by the [[No. 15 ball grenade|No. 15 \"Ball Grenade\"]] to partially overcome some of its inadequacies. An [[Improvised explosive device|improvised]] hand grenade was developed in Australia for use by ANZAC troops called the [[Jam Tin Grenade|Double Cylinder \"jam tin\"]] which consisted of a tin filled with [[dynamite]] or [[guncotton]], packed round with scrap metal or stones. To ignite, at the top of the tin there was a Bickford [[safety fuse]] connecting the detonator, which was lit by either the user, or a second person.<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\"/> The \"[[Mills bomb]]\" (Grenade, Hand No. 5) was introduced in 1915 and would serve in its basic form in the British Army until the 1970s. Its improved fusing system relied on the soldier removing a pin and while holding down a lever on the side of the grenade. When the grenade was thrown the safety lever would automatically release, igniting the grenades internal fuse which would burn down until the grenade detonated. The French would use the [[F1 grenade (France)|F1]] defensive grenade.\n\nThe major grenades used in the beginning by the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] were the impact-detonating \"[[Discus throw|discus]]\" or \"oyster shell\" bomb and the Mod 1913 black powder ''[[Kugelhandgranate]]'' with a friction-ignited time fuse.<ref name=\"Bull 2002. pg.27\"/> In 1915 Germany developed the much more effective ''[[Stielhandgranate]]'', nicknamed \"potato masher\" for its shape, whose variants remained in use for decades; it used a timed fuse system similar to the Mills bomb. \n\nHand grenades were not the only attempt at projectile explosives for infantry. A [[rifle grenade]] was brought into the trenches to attack the enemy from a greater distance. The [[Hales rifle grenade]] got little attention from the British Army before the war began but, during the war, Germany showed great interest in this weapon. The resulting casualties for the Allies caused Britain to search for a new defense.<ref>Bull, Stephen (2002) ''World War 1 Trench Warfare; (1): 1914-16''. Oxford: Osprey Publishing; p. 29</ref>\n\nThe [[Stokes mortar]], a lightweight and very portable [[trench mortar]] with short tube and capable of [[indirect fire]], was rapidly developed and widely imitated.<ref>Duffy, Michael (2000-07) \"Safe Surf\". http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/mortars.htm</ref> Mechanical bomb throwers of lesser range were used in a similar fashion to fire upon the enemy from a safe distance within the trench.\n\nThe [[Sauterelle]] was a grenade launching [[Crossbow]] used before the Stokes mortar by French and British troops.\n\n==Flame throwers==\n[[File:PSM V87 D315 Flame thrower used by the germans to repulse attacks in ww 1.png|thumb|Defensive use]]\nThe Imperial German Army deployed [[flame thrower]]s (''Flammenwerfer'') on the Western Front attempting to flush out French or British soldiers from their trenches. Introduced in 1915, it was used with greatest effect during the [[Hooge, Belgium|Hooge]] battle of the Western Front on 30 July 1915. The German Army had two main types of flame throwers during the Great War: a small single person version called the [[Kleinflammenwerfer]] and a larger crew served configuration called the [[Grossflammenwerfer]]. In the latter, one soldier carried the fuel tank while another aimed the nozzle. Both the large and smaller versions of the flame-thrower were of limited use because their short range left the operator(s) exposed to small arms fire.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of German weapons of World War I]]\n* [[Romanian military equipment of World War I]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Johnson, Jeffrey: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/science_and_technology Science and Technology] , in: [https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/home.html 1914-1918-online.
