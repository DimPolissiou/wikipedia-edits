It has a roll of 600 students with a teaching staff of about 50, with some 18 further auxiliary and administrative staff.\n\n==History==\nIt was opened in 1975 on the site of a former rifle range in a small wooded valley adjacent to [[Logan Park, Dunedin|Logan Park]], an area of land reclaimed from the former [[Lake Logan, New Zealand|Lake Logan]] (itself previously [[Pelichet Bay]]) and now largely converted into a park and playing fields in [[Dunedin North]]. The city's main athletics and soccer venue, the [[Caledonian Ground]], is located next to the school grounds. [[Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza]] and the [[University Oval, Dunedin|University Oval]] cricket ground are also located nearby.\n\nThe school developed from an earlier school in central Dunedin, King Edward High School, which itself had long links with Otago Polytechnic (which has also previously occupied a central Dunedin site). The school's proximity to the city's tertiary institutions (the [[University of Otago]] and [[Otago Polytechnic]]) allows the school access to tertiary study facilities it would otherwise not have access to.\n\nLike most New Zealand state secondary schools of the era, Logan Park High School was constructed to the [[New Zealand standard school buildings#S68|S68 standard plan]], characterised by its single-storey classroom blocks of masonry construction, low-pitched roofs and internal open courtyards.\n\nOn 17 March 2020, the high school was shut down by for 48 hours after one of its students tested positive for the [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]. The school's closure was part of the New Zealand Government's heightened health measures in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sherwood |first1=Sam |title=Dunedin student 12th positive coronavirus case \u2013 high school to close |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/120349877/dunedin-man-11th-positive-coronavirus-case |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=17 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Pupil tests positive, school to close |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/pupil-tests-positive-school-close |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nLogan Park has a current roll of around 600 [[students]], and its roll peaked at about 1200 in 1995. The school has a teaching staff of about 35, with some 15 further auxiliary and administrative staff. LPHS is one of the four-state coeducational schools in [[Dunedin]], and in 1998, Jane Johnson was appointed as the school's first female principal. Ms Johnson retired in 2017, and in September of that year, co-principals Peter Hills and Kristan Mouat were appointed.\n\nLogan Park High School combines both a junior and a senior school. Year 9 (Form 3) and Year 10 (Form 4) are the juniors of the school; Years 11 to 13 (Forms 5 to 7) are the seniors of the school. Most senior students sit their [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] examinations during their time at the school.\n\n==Culture==\nThe school's [[motto]], ''Kua mutu, kua timata'' is [[Maori language|Maori]], and means \"It is finished, but has again begun\" \u2013 a reference to the new school rising from the old King Edward High School, and also to high school as a transition from childhood to adulthood. The school uniform's colours are black, white and maroon. The uniform is optional in year 13.\n\nThe school was divided into five houses although starting in 2008 there have been four, each with its own dean.

It has a roll of 600 students with a teaching staff of about 50, with some 18 further auxiliary and administrative staff.\n\n==History==\nIt was opened in 1975 on the site of a former rifle range in a small wooded valley adjacent to [[Logan Park, Dunedin|Logan Park]], an area of land reclaimed from the former [[Lake Logan, New Zealand|Lake Logan]] (itself previously [[Pelichet Bay]]) and now largely converted into a park and playing fields in [[Dunedin North]]. The city's main athletics and soccer venue, the [[Caledonian Ground]], is located next to the school grounds. [[Forsyth Barr Stadium at University Plaza]] and the [[University Oval, Dunedin|University Oval]] cricket ground are also located nearby.\n\nThe school developed from an earlier school in central Dunedin, King Edward High School, which itself had long links with Otago Polytechnic (which has also previously occupied a central Dunedin site). The school's proximity to the city's tertiary institutions (the [[University of Otago]] and [[Otago Polytechnic]]) allows the school access to tertiary study facilities it would otherwise not have access to.\n\nLike most New Zealand state secondary schools of the era, Logan Park High School was constructed to the [[New Zealand standard school buildings#S68|S68 standard plan]], characterised by its single-storey classroom blocks of masonry construction, low-pitched roofs and internal open courtyards.\n\nOn 17 March 2020, the high school was shut down by for 48 hours after one of its students tested positive for the [[Coronavirus disease 2019]]. The school's closure was part of the New Zealand Government's heightened health measures in response to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sherwood |first1=Sam |title=Dunedin student 12th positive coronavirus case \u2013 high school to close |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/120349877/dunedin-man-11th-positive-coronavirus-case |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=17 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Pupil tests positive, school to close |url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/pupil-tests-positive-school-close |accessdate=17 March 2020 |work=[[Otago Daily Times]] |date=17 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nLogan Park has a current roll of around 600 [[students]], and its roll peaked at about 1200 in 1995. The school has a teaching staff of about 35, with some 15 further auxiliary and administrative staff. LPHS is one of the four-state coeducational schools in [[Dunedin]], and in 1998, Jane Johnson was appointed as the school's first female principal. Ms Johnson retired in 2017, and in September of that year, co-principals Peter Hills and Kristan Mouat were appointed.\n\nLogan Park High School combines both a junior and a senior school. Year 9 (Form 3) and Year 10 (Form 4) are the juniors of the school; Years 11 to 13 (Forms 5 to 7) are the seniors of the school. Most senior students sit their [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] examinations during their time at the school.\n\n==Culture==\nThe school's [[motto]], ''Kua mutu, kua timata'' is [[Maori language|Maori]], and means \"It is finished, but has again begun\" \u2013 a reference to the new school rising from the old King Edward High School, and also to high school as a transition from childhood to adulthood. The school uniform's colours are black, white and maroon. The uniform is optional in year 13.\n\nThe school was divided into five houses although starting in 2008 there have been four, each with its own dean. These houses are named Clayton, Omimi, Aoraki (formerly Aorangi), Toroa and Potiki (although not featuring in the 2008 school year). Each house is split into five groups as of 2011. However, due to an influx of new students. there will be seven groups per house as of 2020.\n\nLogan Park High School is regarded as important in the history of New Zealand rock music as being one of the elements that made up the [[Dunedin sound]].

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (& also Col. of the Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for men began Oct. 23, 1915.       \n\n=== Mobilization & England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year.  During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.   \n\n=== First Actions & Casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Mount Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF|1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment) CEF]]. Of these members, 177281 Private John Leitch, (Later KIA 9 April, 1917), would distinguish himself with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win a Military Medal for bravery in the field on 21st of December, 1916.  The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced & indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning Aug. 18, 1916 in the Ypres area.\u00a0 Their first casualties, 2 wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26th, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA.  On September 16th, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 35 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.<br />\n\n==Unit distinctions==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:    \n\n*'''CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit\u00a0within the Canadian Corps.'''\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada.''' (The other 2 were R.C.R., and P.P.C.L.I.)\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was the only active Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War.''' ''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''\n\n*'''Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by HM King George V in 1919 as a permanent distinction''' in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.<br />\n\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.

Private Young was in Kidderminster, England at the time and received the decoration from King George V at Buckingham Palace in April 1919. That month, he married Ida May Thatcher at St. Mary\u2019s Church in Kidderminster. He took his bride back to Canada, but sadly did not enjoy a long life, dying in 1929.\n\n=== Commemorations / Plaques honouring John Francis Young, VC ===\n\n*'''''Montreal, Canada'''''\n\nA historic tribute plaque was unveiled by The Canadian Grenadier Guards and placed with Sergeant Young's Heads Stone in [[Mount Royal Cemetery]]. The [[Canadian Grenadier Guards]]' Junior Ranks mess has been renamed the \"John Francis Young Club\" in his honour and still bears his name. In Young's honour, members are required to execute a proper halt, briefly coming to attention, upon entering the Club. There is a memorial plaque to him in the Sergeants' mess.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized Sept. 15, 1915, as an exclusively CGG formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The GG, HRH, Duke of Connaught (& also Col. of the Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for men began Oct. 23, 1915.       \n\n=== Mobilization & England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|Empress of Britain]] on April 23rd, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5th, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27th at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 16') and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year.  During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and 4 drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13th, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.   \n\n=== First Actions & Casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel|Battle of Mount Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF|1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment) CEF]]. Of these members, 177281 Private John Leitch, (Later KIA 9 April, 1917), would distinguish himself with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win a Military Medal for bravery in the field on 21st of December, 1916.  The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced & indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning Aug. 18, 1916 in the Ypres area.\u00a0 Their first casualties, 2 wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26th, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA.  On September 16th, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 35 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.<br />\n\n==Unit distinctions==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:    \n\n*'''CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit\u00a0within the Canadian Corps.'''\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada.''' (The other 2 were R.C.R., and P.P.C.L.I.)\n\n*'''The 87th Battalion was the only active Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War.''' ''The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77<sup>th</sup> Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF.\u00a0 The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4<sup>th</sup> & 7<sup>th</sup> \u2019Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF.\u00a0 But these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.''\n\n*'''Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by HM King George V in 1919 as a permanent distinction''' in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.<br />\n\n==Officers Commanding==\n\n*Lieut.-Col.
