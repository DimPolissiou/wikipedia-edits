The right side of its front (southwest-facing) facade has a tall gable section with a projecting rounded bay on its left and the main entrance recessed under a large round arch.

This first library was in a small frame house located on Spring Street near the present day Coltrane-Webb elementary school.  Mayfield Cole was named the first librarian with a salary of $8 per month;<ref>Horton, Clarence E. Jr., Compiler.  ''A Bicentennial History of Concord:  from the Pages of Progress Magazine,'' pg. 306</ref> the library had very limited operating hours and books were acquired via donations from local citizens and it was proclaimed that the library owned a set of encyclopedias as well as a collection of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] works.  The library was governed by a board of directors that was composed of various local business men and/or their wives.  This original library closed after just a year or two of being in operation.\n\nIn 1911, a second attempt at organizing a public library met with greater success.  The Board of Aldermen for the city of Concord named a Board of Trustees who became the governing body for the library.  Various book clubs were in existence in the community and their desire for reading material was a part of the foundation for library services in [[Cabarrus County, North Carolina|Cabarrus County.]]  These clubs banded together to form the Concord Library Association and citizens were charged dues in order to have borrowing privileges at the library which was located on the second floor of the Phifer Building.  Interest was low as the area was still mainly rural and those living in Concord were generally [[textile manufacturing|textile mill]] workers earning low wages; education and reading were low priorities for those citizens.\n\nThe library operated out of space given to them within various buildings in the city of Concord and eventually influential citizens urged the Board of Trustees to borrow money to buy a building dedicated solely to a library.  [[James William Cannon|James W. Cannon]], founder of [[Cannon Mills]] gave $300 towards the purchase of a building for the library and in early 1913, the board purchased a small brick building located on South Union Street for a total cost of $3000.  This building was remodeled in 1916 and ''included the installation of a skylight and \"quiet\" signs.''<ref>Garrison, Barbara Shepherd.

Oklahoma pilots can be proud of Senator Inhofe's accomplishments and dedication to work on issues affecting pilots.\"</ref>\n\nOn October 21, 2010, at the age of 75, Inhofe landed his Cessna on a closed runway at a south Texas airport, scattering construction workers who ran for their lives. In a recorded telephone call, the men's supervisor told the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) that Inhofe \"scared the crap out of\" the workers, adding that the Cessna \"damn near hit\" a truck. And the airport manager, also speaking to the FAA in a recorded telephone call, opined: \"I've got over 50 years flying, three tours of Vietnam, and I can assure you I have never seen such a reckless disregard for human life in my life. Something needs to be done.

He agreed to take a remedial training program, and the FAA agreed not to pursue legal action against him if he took the program. In July 2011, Inhofe introduced a bill to create a \"Pilot's Bill of Rights\", which he said would increase fairness in FAA enforcement actions.<ref>{{cite news |title=Inhofe to introduce 'Pilot's Bill of Rights' |date=July 6, 2011 |url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=505&articleid=20110706_16_A11_CUTLIN890205&archive=yes |author=Jim Meyers |work=Tulsa World }}</ref> The bill was passed in 2012.<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1335 S. 1335 (112th): Pilot's Bill of Rights].
