A [[root canal therapy|root canal filling]], for example, is a restorative technique used to fill the space where the [[dental pulp]] normally resides.\n\n== Tooth preparation ==\n[[Image:Undermined4.jpg|thumb|right|Tooth #3, the upper right first [[molar (tooth)|molar]], with the beginning of an [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|MO]] preparation. Looking into the preparation, the white, outer [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] appears intact, while the yellow, underlying [[dentin]] appears recessed. This is because the dentin was decayed and was thus removed. This portion of the enamel is now unsupported, and should be removed to prevent future fracture.]]\n\nRestoring a tooth to good form and function requires two steps:\n# preparing the tooth for placement of restorative material or materials, and\n# placement of these materials.\nThe process of preparation usually involves cutting the tooth with a rotary dental handpiece and dental [[Burr (cutter)|burrs]] or a [[dental laser]] to make space for the planned restorative materials and to remove any [[tooth cavity|dental decay]] or portions of the tooth that are structurally unsound. If permanent restoration cannot be carried out immediately after tooth preparation, [[temporary restoration]] may be performed.\n\nThe prepared tooth, ready for placement of restorative materials, is generally called a ''tooth preparation''. Materials used may be [[Dental materials#Gold|gold]], [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[dental composite]]s, [[glass ionomer cement]], or [[Dental porcelain|porcelain]], among others.  Preparations may be intracoronal or extracoronal.\nIntracoronal preparations are those which serve to hold restorative material within the confines of the structure of the [[crown (tooth)|crown]] of a tooth. Examples include all classes of cavity preparations for composite or amalgam as well as those for gold and porcelain [[inlays and onlays|inlay]]s. Intracoronal preparations are also made as female recipients to receive the male components of [[Removable partial denture]]s.  Extracoronal preparations provide a core or base upon which restorative material will be placed to bring the tooth back into a functional and aesthetic structure. Examples include [[crown (dentistry)|crowns]] and [[inlays and onlays|onlay]]s, as well as [[veneer (dentistry)|veneer]]s.\n\nIn preparing a tooth for a restoration, a number of considerations will determine the type and extent of the preparation. The most important factor to consider is [[dental caries|decay]]. For the most part, the extent of the decay will define the extent of the preparation, and in turn, the subsequent method and appropriate materials for restoration.\n\nAnother consideration is unsupported tooth structure.  When preparing the tooth to receive a restoration, unsupported enamel is removed to allow for a more predictable restoration. While enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, it is particularly brittle, and unsupported enamel fractures easily.\n\n==Direct restorations==\nThis technique involves placing a soft or malleable filling into the prepared tooth and building up the tooth. The material is then set hard and the tooth is restored. The advantage of direct restorations is that they usually set quickly and can be placed in a single procedure. The dentist has a variety of different filling options to choose from. A decision is usually made based on the location and severity of the associated cavity. Since the material is required to set while in contact with the tooth, limited energy (heat) is passed to the tooth from the setting process.\n\n==Indirect restorations==\n[[File:Inlay on model.jpg|thumb|An indirect restoration fabricated on model from Ips emax ceramic ready to be cemented on natural tooth structure]]\nIn this technique the restoration is fabricated outside of the mouth using the [[dental impressions]] of the prepared tooth. Common indirect restorations include [[inlays and onlays]], [[Crown (dentistry)|crowns]], [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]], and [[veneer (dentistry)|veneers]]. Usually a [[dental technician]] fabricates the indirect restoration from records the dentist has provided. The finished restoration is usually bonded permanently with a [[dental cement]]. It is often done in two separate visits to the dentist. Common indirect restorations are done using gold or ceramics.\n\nWhile the indirect restoration is being prepared, a provisory/[[temporary restoration]] is sometimes used to cover the prepared tooth to help maintain the surrounding dental tissues.\n\nRemovable dental prostheses (mainly [[dentures]]) are sometimes considered a form of indirect dental restoration, as they are made to replace missing teeth. There are numerous types of precision attachments (also known as combined restorations) to aid removable prosthetic attachment to teeth, including magnets, clips, hooks, and implants which may themselves be seen as a form of dental restoration.\n\nThe [[CEREC]] method is a chairside [[CAD/CAM Dentistry|CAD/CAM]] restorative procedure. An optical impression of the prepared tooth is taken using a camera. Next, the specific software takes the digital picture and converts it into a 3D virtual model on the computer screen. A ceramic block that matches the tooth shade is placed in the milling machine. An all-ceramic, tooth-colored restoration is finished and ready to bond in place.\n\nAnother fabrication method is to import [[STL (file format)|STL]] and native dental [[Computer aided design|CAD]] files into CAD/CAM software products that guide the user through the manufacturing process. The software can select the tools, machining sequences and cutting conditions optimized for particular types of materials, such as titanium and zirconium, and for particular prostheses, such as copings and bridges. In some cases, the intricate nature of some implants requires the use of 5-axis machining methods to reach every part of the job.<ref>TCT magazine, \"[http://www.time-compression.com/x/guideArchiveArticle.html?gname=&id=10831 WorkNC Dental at the \"CAD/CAM and Rapid Prototyping in Dental Technology\" conference]\"</ref>\n\n== Cavity classifications ==\n\n[[File:GV-BLACK.JPG|thumb|350px|GV Black Classification of Restorations]]\n'''[[Greene Vardiman Black]] classification:'''\n\nG.V.

[[Titanium]], usually commercially pure but sometimes a 90% alloy, is used as the anchor for [[dental implants]] as it is [[biocompatible]] and can integrate into bone.\n\n;Precious metallic alloys\n\n*[[gold]] (high purity: 99.7%)\n*[[gold alloys]] (with high gold content)\n*gold-platina alloy\n*silver-palladium alloy\n\n;Base metallic alloys\n\n*[[cobalt-chrome]] alloy\n*[[nickel-chrome]] alloy\n\n=== Amalgam ===\n{{main|Amalgam (dentistry)}}\nAmalgams are alloys formed by a reaction between two or more metals, one of which is mercury. It is a hard restorative material and is silvery-grey in colour. One of the oldest direct restorative materials still in use, dental amalgam was widely used in the past with a high degree of success, although recently its popularity has declined due to a number of reasons, including the development of alternative bonded restorative materials, increase in demand for more aesthetic restorations and public perceptions concerning the potential health risks of the material.\n\nThe composition of dental amalgam is controlled by the ISO Standard for dental amalgam alloy (ISO 1559).<ref name=\":0\" /> The major components of amalgam are silver, tin and copper.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other metals and small amounts of minor elements such as zinc, mercury, palladium, platinum and indium are also present.<ref name=\":0\" /> Earlier versions of dental amalgams, known as 'conventional' amalgams consisted of at least 65 wt% silver, 29 wt% tin, and less than 6 wt% copper.<ref name=\":0\" /> Improvements in the understanding of the structure of amalgam post-1986 gave rise to copper-enriched amalgam alloys, which contain between 12 wt% and 30 wt% copper and at least 40 wt% silver.<ref name=\":0\" /> The higher level of copper improved the setting reaction of amalgam, giving greater corrosion resistance and early strength after setting.\n\nPossible indications for amalgam are for load-bearing restorations in medium to large sized cavities in posterior teeth, and in core build-ups when a definitive restoration will be an indirect cast restoration such as a crown or bridge retainer. Contraindications for amalgam are if aesthetics are paramount to patient due to the colour of the material. Amalgams should be avoided if the patient has a history of sensitivity to mercury or other amalgam components. Besides that, amalgam is avoided if there is extensive loss of tooth substance such that a retentive cavity cannot be produced, or if excessive removal of health tooth substance would be required to produce a retentive cavity.\n\nAdvantages of amalgam include durability - if placed under ideal conditions, there is evidence of good long term clinical performance of the restorations. Placement time of amalgam is shorter compared to that of composites and the restoration can be completed in a single appointment. The material is also more technique-forgiving compared to composite restorations used for that purpose. Dental amalgam is also radiopaque which is beneficial for differentiating the material between tooth tissues on radiographs for diagnosing secondary caries. The cost of the restoration is typically cheaper than composite restorations.\n\nDisadvantages of amalgam include poor aesthetic qualities due to its colour. Amalgam does not bond to tooth easily, hence it relies on mechanical forms of retention. Examples of this are undercuts, slots/grooves or root canal posts. In some cases this may necessitate excessive amounts of healthy tooth structure to be removed. Hence, alternative resin-based or glass-ionomer cement-based materials are used instead for smaller restorations including pit and small fissure caries. There is also a risk of marginal breakdown in the restorations. This could be due to corrosion which may result in \"creep\" and \"ditching\" of the restoration. Creep can be defined as the slow internal stressing and deformation of amalgam under stress. This effect is reduced by incorporating copper into amalgam alloys. Some patients may experience local sensitivity reactions to amalgam.\n\nAlthough the [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in cured amalgam is not available as free mercury, concern of its toxicity has existed since the invention of amalgam as a dental material. It is banned or restricted in Norway, Sweden and Finland. See [[Dental Amalgam Controversy]].\n\n=== Direct Gold ===\n\n*Gold\nDirect gold fillings were practiced during the times of the Civil War in America. \nAlthough rarely used today, due to expense and specialized training requirements, gold foil can be used for direct dental restorations.\n\n===Composite resin===\n\n[[File:Dental Restoration.jpg|thumb|Dental restoration using composite bonding]]\n\n{{main|Dental composite}}\n\nDental composites, commonly described to patients as \"white fillings\", are a group of restorative materials used in dentistry. They can be used in direct restorations to fill in the cavities created by dental caries and trauma, minor buildup for restoring tooth wear (non-carious tooth surface loss) and filling in small gaps between teeth (labial veneer). Dental composites are also used as indirect restoration to make crowns and inlays in the laboratory.\n\nThese materials are similar to those used in direct fillings and are tooth-colored. Their strength and durability is not as high as porcelain or metal restorations and they are more prone to wear and discolouration. As with other composite materials, a dental composite typically consists of a resin-based matrix,  which contains a modified methacrylate or acrylate. Two examples of such commonly used monomers include [[bisphenol A]]-[[glycidyl methacrylate]] (BISMA) and [[urethane dimethacrylate]] (UDMA), together with tri-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGMA). TEGMA is a [[comonomer]] which can be used to control viscosity, as Bis GMA is a large molecule with high viscosity, for easier clinical handling.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Applied Dental Materials|last=F.McCabe|first=John|last2=W.G.Walls|first2=Angus|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|year=2008|isbn=9781405139618|location=|pages=197\u2013198}}</ref> Inorganic filler such as [[silicon dioxide|silica]], quartz or various glasses, are added to reduce [[polymerization]] shrinkage by occupying volume and to confirm radio-opacity of products due to translucency in property,{{what|date=March 2020}} which can be helpful in diagnosis of dental caries around dental restorations. The filler particles give the composites [[wear resistance]] as well. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. A coupling agent such as [[silane]] is used to enhance the bond between resin matrix and filler particles. An initiator package{{what|date=March 2020}} begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when external energy (light/heat, etc.) is applied. For example, camphorquinone can be excited by visible blue light with critical wavelength of 460-480&nbsp;nm to yield necessary free radicals to start the process.\n\nAfter [[#Tooth preparation|tooth preparation]], a thin primer or bonding agent is used. Modern [[photo polymerisation|photo-polymerised]] composites are applied and cured in relatively thin layers as determined by their opacity.<ref>Canadian Dental Association, [http://www.cda-adc.ca/en/oral_health/procedures/fillings/tooth-coloured.asp Tooth-coloured fillings]</ref> After some curing, the final surface will be shaped and polished.\n\n===Glass ionomer cement===\n{{main|Glass ionomer cement}}\nA [[glass ionomer cement]] (GIC) is a class of materials commonly used in dentistry as direct filling materials and/or for luting indirect restorations. GIC can also be placed as a lining material in some restorations for extra protection.  These tooth-coloured materials were introduced in 1972 for use as restorative materials for anterior teeth (particularly for eroded areas).<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe material consists of two main components: Liquid and powder. The liquid is the acidic component containing of polyacrylic acid and tartaric acid (added to control the setting characteristics). The powder is the basic component consisting of sodium alumino-silicate glass.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Ricardo Tome|date=2013-06-02|title=A clinical guide to applied dental materials 1st edn.A Clinical Guide to Applied Dental Materials 1st edn.

This makes it easier for the operator to use the material in clinic.  \n\n* GIC does not require bond, it can bond can bond to enamel and dentine without the need for use of an intermediate material. Conventional GIC also has a good sealing ability providing little leakage around restoration margins and reducing the risk of secondary caries.\n\n* GIC contains and releases fluoride after being placed therefore it helps in preventing carious lesions in teeth.\n\n* It has good thermal properties as the expansion under stimulus is similar to dentine.\n\n* The material does not contract on setting meaning it is not subject to shrinkage and microleakage.\n\n* GIC is also less susceptible to staining and colour change than composite.\n\nDisadvantages of using Glass ionomer cement<ref name=\":0\" />:\n\n* GIC have poor wear resistance, they are usually weak after setting and are not stable in water however this improves when time goes on and progression reactions take place. Due to their low strength GICs are not appropriate to be placed in cavities in areas which bear an increase amount of occlusal load or wear.\n\n* The material is susceptible to moisture when it is first placed.\n\n* GIC varies in translucency therefore it can have poor aesthetics , especially noticeable if placed on anterior teeth.\n\n'''RESIN MODIFIED GLASS IONOMER'''\n\nRMGIC was developed to combine the properties of glass ionomer cement with composite technology. RMGIC comes in a powder/ liquid form. The powder contains fluro-alumino-silicate Glass ,Barium Glass (Provides Radiopacity),Potassium persulphate (It is a redox catalyst to provide resin cure in the dark) and other components such as pigments. The liquid consists of HEMA (Water miscible resin), Polyacrylic acid (with pendant methacrylate groups. This can undergo both acid base and polymerisation reactions) & Tartaric acid. It also has photo initiators present which enable light curing<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\nRMGIC has a number of uses in dentistry. It can be placed as a dressing, applied as fissure sealant, placed in endodontic access cavity as a temporary filling, as a luting agent. RMGIC can also be used to restore lesions in both primary and permanent dentition. They are easier to use and are a very popular group of materials.\n\nAdvantages of using RMGIC:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Provides a good bond to enamel and dentine.\n* It has better physical properties than GIC.\n* A Lower solubility in moisture.\n* It also releases fluoride overtime>\n* Provided better translucency and aesthetics as compared to GIC.\n* Better handling properties making it easier to use.\n\nDisadvantages of using RMGIC:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Polymerisation Contraction can cause microleakage around restoration margins\n* It has an exothermic setting reaction which can cause potential damage to tooth tissue. \n* The material swells due to uptake of water as HEMA is extremely hydrophilic.\n* \u00a0Monomer leaching : HEMA is toxic to the pulp therefore it must be polymerised completely.\n* The strength of the material reduces if its not light-cured.\n\nGIC and RMGIC are used in dentistry, there will be times when one of these materials is better than the other but that is dependant upon the clinical situation. However in most cases the ease of use is deciding factor.\n\n=== Compomer ===\n{{main|Dental compomer}}\nDental compomers are another type of white filling material although their use is not as widespread.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to dental materials|last=Noort, Richard van.|date=2013|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7234-3659-1|edition=4th|location=Edinburgh|oclc=821697096}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Dental materials : foundations and applications|last=Powers, John M., 1946-|others=Wataha, John C.,, Chen, Yen-Wei|isbn=978-0-323-31637-8|edition=11|location=St. Louis, Missouri|oclc=925266398|date = 2016-01-25}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=John W.|last2=Swift|first2=Edward J.|date=February 2008|title=COMPOMERS|journal=Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=3\u20134|doi=10.1111/j.1708-8240.2008.00141.x|pmid=18237333|issn=1496-4155}}</ref>\n\nCompomers were formed by modifying dental composites with poly-acid in an effort to combine the desirable properties of dental composites, namely their good aesthetics, and glass ionomer cements, namely their ability to release fluoride over a long time.

They are also used as inlays, onlays, and aesthetic [[porcelain veneers|veneers]]. A veneer is a very thin shell of porcelain that can replace or cover part of the enamel of the tooth. Full-porcelain restorations are particularly desirable because their color and translucency mimic natural tooth enamel.\n\nAnother type is known as ''porcelain-fused-to-metal'', which is used to provide strength to a crown or bridge. These restorations are very strong, durable and resistant to wear, because the combination of porcelain and metal creates a stronger restoration than porcelain used alone.\n\nOne of the advantages of computerized dentistry (CAD/CAM technologies) involves the use of machinable ceramics which are sold in a partially [[Sintering|sintered]], machinable state that is fired again after machining to form a hard ceramic. Some of the materials used are [[glass-bonded porcelain]] (Viablock), [[lithium disilicate]] [[glass-ceramic]] (a ceramic crystallizing from a glass by special heat treatment), and phase stabilized [[zirconia]] (zirconium dioxide, ZrO<sub>2</sub>). Previous attempts to utilize high-performance ceramics such as zirconium-oxide were thwarted by the fact that this material could not be processed using the traditional methods used in dentistry. Because of its high strength and comparatively much higher fracture toughness, sintered zirconium oxide can be used in posterior crowns and bridges, implant abutments, and root dowel pins. Lithium disilicate (used in the latest Chairside Economical Restoration of Esthetic Ceramics [[CEREC]] product) also has the fracture resistance needed for use on molars.<ref>Christian F.J. Stappert, Wael Att, Thomas Gerds, and Joerg R.

Not as aesthetic as porcelain-fused-to-ceramic, many dentists will not use new machine-made \"monolithic\" zirconia and lithium disilicate crowns on anterior (front) teeth.<ref>\"Where and When Is It Appropriate to Place Monolithic vs. Layered Restorations,\" Inside Dentistry, August 2012, Vol. 8, Issue 8, E. McLaren, R. Margeas, N. Fahl.</ref>\n\nCast metals and porcelain-on-metal are currently the standard material for crowns and bridges. The demand for full ceramic solutions, however, continues to grow.\n\n=== Comparison ===\n*Composites and Amalgam are used mainly for direct restoration. Composites can be made of color matching the tooth, and the surface can be polished after the filling procedure has been completed.\n*Amalgam fillings expand with age, possibly cracking the tooth and requiring repair and filling replacement. But chance of leakage of filling is less.\n*Composite fillings shrink with age and may pull away from the tooth allowing leakage. If leakage is not noticed early, recurrent decay may occur.\n*A 2003 study showed that fillings have a finite lifespan:  an average of 12.8 years for amalgam and 7.8 years for composite resins.<ref name=\"pmid12878022\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Nieuwenhuysen JP, D'Hoore W, Carvalho J, Qvist V | title=Long-term evaluation of extensive restorations in permanent teeth | journal= [[Journal of Dentistry]] | volume=31 | issue=6 | year=2003 | pages=395\u2013405 | pmid=12878022 | doi=10.1016/s0300-5712(03)00084-8}}</ref> Fillings fail because of changes in the filling, tooth or the bond between them.

They can support dental restorations which replace missing teeth. Some restorative applications include supporting crowns, bridges, or [[denture|dental prostheses]].\n\n== Complications ==\n\n=== Irritation of the nerve ===\nWhen a deep cavity had been filled, there is a possibility that the nerve may have been irritated.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} This either results in short term sensitivity to cold and hot substances, and pain when biting down on the specific tooth. It may settle down on its own. If not, then alternative treatment such as [[Endodontic therapy|root canal treatment]] may be considered to resolve the pain while keeping the tooth.\n\n=== Weakening of tooth structure ===\nIn situations where a relatively larger amount of tooth structure has been lost or replaced with a filling material, the overall strength of the tooth may be affected. This significantly increases the risk of the tooth fracturing off in the future when excess force is placed on the tooth, such as trauma or grinding teeth at night, leading to [[cracked tooth syndrome]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{div col|small=yes|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Dental curing light]]\n*[[Dental dam]]\n*[[Dental fear]]\n*[[Dental braces]]\n*[[Dental treatment]]\n*[[Fixed prosthodontics]]\n*[[Gold teeth]]\n*[[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n*[[Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth]]\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.quackwatch.org/03HealthPromotion/dentalmaterials.html How Dental Restoration Materials Compare]\n*[http://www.adentalls.com/product-category/filling-material/.html How To Use Dental Filling material]\n{{Prosthodontology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dental Restoration}}\n[[Category:Dental materials]]\n[[Category:Dentistry procedures]]\n[[Category:Restorative dentistry]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox interventions |\n  Name        = Dental restoration |\n  Image       = |\n  Caption     = |\n  ICD10       = |\n  ICD9        = {{ICD9proc|23.2}}-{{ICD9proc|23.4}} |\n  MeshID      = |\n  OPS301      = |\n  OtherCodes  = |\n  HCPCSlevel2     =\n}}\nA '''dental restoration''' or '''dental filling''' is a treatment to restore the function, integrity, and morphology of missing [[tooth]] structure resulting from [[Dental caries|caries]] or external trauma as well as to the replacement of such structure supported by [[dental implant]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/dental-health-cavities#1|title=Your Teeth and Cavities|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en-US}}</ref>  They are of two broad types\u2014''direct''  and ''indirect''\u2014and are further classified by location and size. A [[root canal therapy|root canal filling]], for example, is a restorative technique used to fill the space where the [[dental pulp]] normally resides.\n\n== Tooth preparation ==\n[[Image:Undermined4.jpg|thumb|right|Tooth #3, the upper right first [[molar (tooth)|molar]], with the beginning of an [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|MO]] preparation. Looking into the preparation, the white, outer [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] appears intact, while the yellow, underlying [[dentin]] appears recessed. This is because the dentin was decayed and was thus removed. This portion of the enamel is now unsupported, and should be removed to prevent future fracture.]]\n\nRestoring a tooth to good form and function requires two steps:\n# preparing the tooth for placement of restorative material or materials, and\n# placement of these materials.\nThe process of preparation usually involves cutting the tooth with a rotary dental handpiece and dental [[Burr (cutter)|burrs]] or a [[dental laser]] to make space for the planned restorative materials and to remove any [[tooth cavity|dental decay]] or portions of the tooth that are structurally unsound. If permanent restoration cannot be carried out immediately after tooth preparation, [[temporary restoration]] may be performed.\n\nThe prepared tooth, ready for placement of restorative materials, is generally called a ''tooth preparation''. Materials used may be [[Dental materials#Gold|gold]], [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[dental composite]]s, [[glass ionomer cement]], or [[Dental porcelain|porcelain]], among others.  Preparations may be intracoronal or extracoronal.\nIntracoronal preparations are those which serve to hold restorative material within the confines of the structure of the [[crown (tooth)|crown]] of a tooth. Examples include all classes of cavity preparations for composite or amalgam as well as those for gold and porcelain [[inlays and onlays|inlay]]s. Intracoronal preparations are also made as female recipients to receive the male components of [[Removable partial denture]]s.  Extracoronal preparations provide a core or base upon which restorative material will be placed to bring the tooth back into a functional and aesthetic structure. Examples include [[crown (dentistry)|crowns]] and [[inlays and onlays|onlay]]s, as well as [[veneer (dentistry)|veneer]]s.\n\nIn preparing a tooth for a restoration, a number of considerations will determine the type and extent of the preparation. The most important factor to consider is [[dental caries|decay]]. For the most part, the extent of the decay will define the extent of the preparation, and in turn, the subsequent method and appropriate materials for restoration.\n\nAnother consideration is unsupported tooth structure.  When preparing the tooth to receive a restoration, unsupported enamel is removed to allow for a more predictable restoration. While enamel is the hardest substance in the human body, it is particularly brittle, and unsupported enamel fractures easily.\n\n==Direct restorations==\nThis technique involves placing a soft or malleable filling into the prepared tooth and building up the tooth. The material is then set hard and the tooth is restored. The advantage of direct restorations is that they usually set quickly and can be placed in a single procedure. The dentist has a variety of different filling options to choose from. A decision is usually made based on the location and severity of the associated cavity. Since the material is required to set while in contact with the tooth, limited energy (heat) is passed to the tooth from the setting process.\n\n==Indirect restorations==\n[[File:Inlay on model.jpg|thumb|An indirect restoration fabricated on model from Ips emax ceramic ready to be cemented on natural tooth structure]]\nIn this technique the restoration is fabricated outside of the mouth using the [[dental impressions]] of the prepared tooth. Common indirect restorations include [[inlays and onlays]], [[Crown (dentistry)|crowns]], [[bridge (dentistry)|bridges]], and [[veneer (dentistry)|veneers]]. Usually a [[dental technician]] fabricates the indirect restoration from records the dentist has provided. The finished restoration is usually bonded permanently with a [[dental cement]]. It is often done in two separate visits to the dentist. Common indirect restorations are done using gold or ceramics.\n\nWhile the indirect restoration is being prepared, a provisory/[[temporary restoration]] is sometimes used to cover the prepared tooth to help maintain the surrounding dental tissues.\n\nRemovable dental prostheses (mainly [[dentures]]) are sometimes considered a form of indirect dental restoration, as they are made to replace missing teeth. There are numerous types of precision attachments (also known as combined restorations) to aid removable prosthetic attachment to teeth, including magnets, clips, hooks, and implants which may themselves be seen as a form of dental restoration.\n\nThe [[CEREC]] method is a chairside [[CAD/CAM Dentistry|CAD/CAM]] restorative procedure. An optical impression of the prepared tooth is taken using a camera. Next, the specific software takes the digital picture and converts it into a 3D virtual model on the computer screen. A ceramic block that matches the tooth shade is placed in the milling machine. An all-ceramic, tooth-colored restoration is finished and ready to bond in place.\n\nAnother fabrication method is to import [[STL (file format)|STL]] and native dental [[Computer aided design|CAD]] files into CAD/CAM software products that guide the user through the manufacturing process. The software can select the tools, machining sequences and cutting conditions optimized for particular types of materials, such as titanium and zirconium, and for particular prostheses, such as copings and bridges. In some cases, the intricate nature of some implants requires the use of 5-axis machining methods to reach every part of the job.<ref>TCT magazine, \"[http://www.time-compression.com/x/guideArchiveArticle.html?gname=&id=10831 WorkNC Dental at the \"CAD/CAM and Rapid Prototyping in Dental Technology\" conference]\"</ref>\n\n== Cavity classifications ==\n\n[[File:GV-BLACK.JPG|thumb|350px|GV Black Classification of Restorations]]\n'''[[Greene Vardiman Black]] classification:'''\n\nG.V.

[[Titanium]], usually commercially pure but sometimes a 90% alloy, is used as the anchor for [[dental implants]] as it is [[biocompatible]] and can integrate into bone.\n\n;Precious metallic alloys\n\n*[[gold]] (high purity: 99.7%)\n*[[gold alloys]] (with high gold content)\n*gold-platina alloy\n*silver-palladium alloy\n\n;Base metallic alloys\n\n*[[cobalt-chrome]] alloy\n*[[nickel-chrome]] alloy\n\n=== Amalgam ===\n{{main|Amalgam (dentistry)}}\nAmalgams are alloys formed by a reaction between two or more metals, one of which is mercury. It is a hard restorative material and is silvery-grey in colour. One of the oldest direct restorative materials still in use, dental amalgam was widely used in the past with a high degree of success, although recently its popularity has declined due to a number of reasons, including the development of alternative bonded restorative materials, increase in demand for more aesthetic restorations and public perceptions concerning the potential health risks of the material.\n\nThe composition of dental amalgam is controlled by the ISO Standard for dental amalgam alloy (ISO 1559).<ref name=\":0\" /> The major components of amalgam are silver, tin and copper.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other metals and small amounts of minor elements such as zinc, mercury, palladium, platinum and indium are also present.<ref name=\":0\" /> Earlier versions of dental amalgams, known as 'conventional' amalgams consisted of at least 65 wt% silver, 29 wt% tin, and less than 6 wt% copper.<ref name=\":0\" /> Improvements in the understanding of the structure of amalgam post-1986 gave rise to copper-enriched amalgam alloys, which contain between 12 wt% and 30 wt% copper and at least 40 wt% silver.<ref name=\":0\" /> The higher level of copper improved the setting reaction of amalgam, giving greater corrosion resistance and early strength after setting.\n\nPossible indications for amalgam are for load-bearing restorations in medium to large sized cavities in posterior teeth, and in core build-ups when a definitive restoration will be an indirect cast restoration such as a crown or bridge retainer. Contraindications for amalgam are if aesthetics are paramount to patient due to the colour of the material. Amalgams should be avoided if the patient has a history of sensitivity to mercury or other amalgam components. Besides that, amalgam is avoided if there is extensive loss of tooth substance such that a retentive cavity cannot be produced, or if excessive removal of health tooth substance would be required to produce a retentive cavity.\n\nAdvantages of amalgam include durability - if placed under ideal conditions, there is evidence of good long term clinical performance of the restorations. Placement time of amalgam is shorter compared to that of composites and the restoration can be completed in a single appointment. The material is also more technique-forgiving compared to composite restorations used for that purpose. Dental amalgam is also radiopaque which is beneficial for differentiating the material between tooth tissues on radiographs for diagnosing secondary caries. The cost of the restoration is typically cheaper than composite restorations.\n\nDisadvantages of amalgam include poor aesthetic qualities due to its colour. Amalgam does not bond to tooth easily, hence it relies on mechanical forms of retention. Examples of this are undercuts, slots/grooves or root canal posts. In some cases this may necessitate excessive amounts of healthy tooth structure to be removed. Hence, alternative resin-based or glass-ionomer cement-based materials are used instead for smaller restorations including pit and small fissure caries. There is also a risk of marginal breakdown in the restorations. This could be due to corrosion which may result in \"creep\" and \"ditching\" of the restoration. Creep can be defined as the slow internal stressing and deformation of amalgam under stress. This effect is reduced by incorporating copper into amalgam alloys. Some patients may experience local sensitivity reactions to amalgam.\n\nAlthough the [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in cured amalgam is not available as free mercury, concern of its toxicity has existed since the invention of amalgam as a dental material. It is banned or restricted in Norway, Sweden and Finland. See [[Dental Amalgam Controversy]].\n\n=== Direct Gold ===\n\n*Gold\nDirect gold fillings were practiced during the times of the Civil War in America. \nAlthough rarely used today, due to expense and specialized training requirements, gold foil can be used for direct dental restorations.\n\n===Composite resin===\n\n[[File:Dental Restoration.jpg|thumb|Dental restoration using composite bonding]]\n\n{{main|Dental composite}}\n\nDental composites, commonly described to patients as \"white fillings\", are a group of restorative materials used in dentistry. They can be used in direct restorations to fill in the cavities created by dental caries and trauma, minor buildup for restoring tooth wear (non-carious tooth surface loss) and filling in small gaps between teeth (labial veneer). Dental composites are also used as indirect restoration to make crowns and inlays in the laboratory.\n\nThese materials are similar to those used in direct fillings and are tooth-colored. Their strength and durability is not as high as porcelain or metal restorations and they are more prone to wear and discolouration. As with other composite materials, a dental composite typically consists of a resin-based matrix,  which contains a modified methacrylate or acrylate. Two examples of such commonly used monomers include [[bisphenol A]]-[[glycidyl methacrylate]] (BISMA) and [[urethane dimethacrylate]] (UDMA), together with tri-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGMA). TEGMA is a [[comonomer]] which can be used to control viscosity, as Bis GMA is a large molecule with high viscosity, for easier clinical handling.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Applied Dental Materials|last=F.McCabe|first=John|last2=W.G.Walls|first2=Angus|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|year=2008|isbn=9781405139618|location=|pages=197\u2013198}}</ref> Inorganic filler such as [[silicon dioxide|silica]], quartz or various glasses, are added to reduce [[polymerization]] shrinkage by occupying volume and to confirm radio-opacity of products due to translucency in property,{{what|date=March 2020}} which can be helpful in diagnosis of dental caries around dental restorations. The filler particles give the composites [[wear resistance]] as well. Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. A coupling agent such as [[silane]] is used to enhance the bond between resin matrix and filler particles. An initiator package{{what|date=March 2020}} begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when external energy (light/heat, etc.) is applied. For example, camphorquinone can be excited by visible blue light with critical wavelength of 460-480&nbsp;nm to yield necessary free radicals to start the process.\n\nAfter [[#Tooth preparation|tooth preparation]], a thin primer or bonding agent is used. Modern [[photo polymerisation|photo-polymerised]] composites are applied and cured in relatively thin layers as determined by their opacity.<ref>Canadian Dental Association, [http://www.cda-adc.ca/en/oral_health/procedures/fillings/tooth-coloured.asp Tooth-coloured fillings]</ref> After some curing, the final surface will be shaped and polished.\n\n===Glass ionomer cement===\n{{main|Glass ionomer cement}}\nA [[glass ionomer cement]] (GIC) is a class of materials commonly used in dentistry as direct filling materials and/or for luting indirect restorations. GIC can also be placed as a lining material in some restorations for extra protection.  These tooth-coloured materials were introduced in 1972 for use as restorative materials for anterior teeth (particularly for eroded areas).<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nThe material consists of two main components: Liquid and powder. The liquid is the acidic component containing of polyacrylic acid and tartaric acid (added to control the setting characteristics). The powder is the basic component consisting of sodium alumino-silicate glass.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Martins|first=Ricardo Tome|date=2013-06-02|title=A clinical guide to applied dental materials 1st edn.A Clinical Guide to Applied Dental Materials 1st edn.

This makes it easier for the operator to use the material in clinic.  \n\n* GIC does not require bond, it can bond can bond to enamel and dentine without the need for use of an intermediate material. Conventional GIC also has a good sealing ability providing little leakage around restoration margins and reducing the risk of secondary caries.\n\n* GIC contains and releases fluoride after being placed therefore it helps in preventing carious lesions in teeth.\n\n* It has good thermal properties as the expansion under stimulus is similar to dentine.\n\n* The material does not contract on setting meaning it is not subject to shrinkage and microleakage.\n\n* GIC is also less susceptible to staining and colour change than composite.\n\nDisadvantages of using Glass ionomer cement<ref name=\":0\" />:\n\n* GIC have poor wear resistance, they are usually weak after setting and are not stable in water however this improves when time goes on and progression reactions take place. Due to their low strength GICs are not appropriate to be placed in cavities in areas which bear an increase amount of occlusal load or wear.\n\n* The material is susceptible to moisture when it is first placed.\n\n* GIC varies in translucency therefore it can have poor aesthetics , especially noticeable if placed on anterior teeth.\n\n'''RESIN MODIFIED GLASS IONOMER'''\n\nRMGIC was developed to combine the properties of glass ionomer cement with composite technology. RMGIC comes in a powder/ liquid form. The powder contains fluro-alumino-silicate Glass ,Barium Glass (Provides Radiopacity),Potassium persulphate (It is a redox catalyst to provide resin cure in the dark) and other components such as pigments. The liquid consists of HEMA (Water miscible resin), Polyacrylic acid (with pendant methacrylate groups. This can undergo both acid base and polymerisation reactions) & Tartaric acid. It also has photo initiators present which enable light curing<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\nRMGIC has a number of uses in dentistry. It can be placed as a dressing, applied as fissure sealant, placed in endodontic access cavity as a temporary filling, as a luting agent. RMGIC can also be used to restore lesions in both primary and permanent dentition. They are easier to use and are a very popular group of materials.\n\nAdvantages of using RMGIC:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Provides a good bond to enamel and dentine.\n* It has better physical properties than GIC.\n* A Lower solubility in moisture.\n* It also releases fluoride overtime>\n* Provided better translucency and aesthetics as compared to GIC.\n* Better handling properties making it easier to use.\n\nDisadvantages of using RMGIC:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Polymerisation Contraction can cause microleakage around restoration margins\n* It has an exothermic setting reaction which can cause potential damage to tooth tissue. \n* The material swells due to uptake of water as HEMA is extremely hydrophilic.\n* \u00a0Monomer leaching : HEMA is toxic to the pulp therefore it must be polymerised completely.\n* The strength of the material reduces if its not light-cured.\n\nGIC and RMGIC are used in dentistry, there will be times when one of these materials is better than the other but that is dependant upon the clinical situation. However in most cases the ease of use is deciding factor.\n\n=== Compomer ===\n{{main|Dental compomer}}\nDental compomers are another type of white filling material although their use is not as widespread.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Introduction to dental materials|last=Noort, Richard van.|date=2013|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|isbn=978-0-7234-3659-1|edition=4th|location=Edinburgh|oclc=821697096}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Dental materials : foundations and applications|last=Powers, John M., 1946-|others=Wataha, John C.,, Chen, Yen-Wei|isbn=978-0-323-31637-8|edition=11|location=St. Louis, Missouri|oclc=925266398|date = 2016-01-25}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Nicholson|first=John W.|last2=Swift|first2=Edward J.|date=February 2008|title=COMPOMERS|journal=Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=3\u20134|doi=10.1111/j.1708-8240.2008.00141.x|pmid=18237333|issn=1496-4155}}</ref>\n\nCompomers were formed by modifying dental composites with poly-acid in an effort to combine the desirable properties of dental composites, namely their good aesthetics, and glass ionomer cements, namely their ability to release fluoride over a long time.

They are also used as inlays, onlays, and aesthetic [[porcelain veneers|veneers]]. A veneer is a very thin shell of porcelain that can replace or cover part of the enamel of the tooth. Full-porcelain restorations are particularly desirable because their color and translucency mimic natural tooth enamel.\n\nAnother type is known as ''porcelain-fused-to-metal'', which is used to provide strength to a crown or bridge. These restorations are very strong, durable and resistant to wear, because the combination of porcelain and metal creates a stronger restoration than porcelain used alone.\n\nOne of the advantages of computerized dentistry (CAD/CAM technologies) involves the use of machinable ceramics which are sold in a partially [[Sintering|sintered]], machinable state that is fired again after machining to form a hard ceramic. Some of the materials used are [[glass-bonded porcelain]] (Viablock), [[lithium disilicate]] [[glass-ceramic]] (a ceramic crystallizing from a glass by special heat treatment), and phase stabilized [[zirconia]] (zirconium dioxide, ZrO<sub>2</sub>). Previous attempts to utilize high-performance ceramics such as zirconium-oxide were thwarted by the fact that this material could not be processed using the traditional methods used in dentistry. Because of its high strength and comparatively much higher fracture toughness, sintered zirconium oxide can be used in posterior crowns and bridges, implant abutments, and root dowel pins. Lithium disilicate (used in the latest Chairside Economical Restoration of Esthetic Ceramics [[CEREC]] product) also has the fracture resistance needed for use on molars.<ref>Christian F.J.

Not as aesthetic as porcelain-fused-to-ceramic, many dentists will not use new machine-made \"monolithic\" zirconia and lithium disilicate crowns on anterior (front) teeth.<ref>\"Where and When Is It Appropriate to Place Monolithic vs. Layered Restorations,\" Inside Dentistry, August 2012, Vol. 8, Issue 8, E. McLaren, R. Margeas, N. Fahl.</ref>\n\nCast metals and porcelain-on-metal are currently the standard material for crowns and bridges. The demand for full ceramic solutions, however, continues to grow.\n\n=== Comparison ===\n*Composites and Amalgam are used mainly for direct restoration. Composites can be made of color matching the tooth, and the surface can be polished after the filling procedure has been completed.\n*Amalgam fillings expand with age, possibly cracking the tooth and requiring repair and filling replacement. But chance of leakage of filling is less.\n*Composite fillings shrink with age and may pull away from the tooth allowing leakage. If leakage is not noticed early, recurrent decay may occur.\n*A 2003 study showed that fillings have a finite lifespan:  an average of 12.8 years for amalgam and 7.8 years for composite resins.<ref name=\"pmid12878022\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Van Nieuwenhuysen JP, D'Hoore W, Carvalho J, Qvist V | title=Long-term evaluation of extensive restorations in permanent teeth | journal= [[Journal of Dentistry]] | volume=31 | issue=6 | year=2003 | pages=395\u2013405 | pmid=12878022 | doi=10.1016/s0300-5712(03)00084-8}}</ref> Fillings fail because of changes in the filling, tooth or the bond between them.

They can support dental restorations which replace missing teeth. Some restorative applications include supporting crowns, bridges, or [[denture|dental prostheses]].\n\n== Complications ==\n\n=== Irritation of the nerve ===\nWhen a deep cavity had been filled, there is a possibility that the nerve may have been irritated.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} This either results in short term sensitivity to cold and hot substances, and pain when biting down on the specific tooth. It may settle down on its own. If not, then alternative treatment such as [[Endodontic therapy|root canal treatment]] may be considered to resolve the pain while keeping the tooth.\n\n=== Weakening of tooth structure ===\nIn situations where a relatively larger amount of tooth structure has been lost or replaced with a filling material, the overall strength of the tooth may be affected. This significantly increases the risk of the tooth fracturing off in the future when excess force is placed on the tooth, such as trauma or grinding teeth at night, leading to [[cracked tooth syndrome]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Medicine}}\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{div col|small=yes|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[Dental curing light]]\n*[[Dental dam]]\n*[[Dental fear]]\n*[[Dental braces]]\n*[[Dental treatment]]\n*[[Fixed prosthodontics]]\n*[[Gold teeth]]\n*[[Oral and maxillofacial surgery]]\n*[[Treatment of knocked-out (avulsed) teeth]]\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.quackwatch.org/03HealthPromotion/dentalmaterials.html How Dental Restoration Materials Compare]\n\n{{Prosthodontology}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dental Restoration}}\n[[Category:Dental materials]]\n[[Category:Dentistry procedures]]\n[[Category:Restorative dentistry]]\n", "name_user": "Imranalfalah", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dental_restoration"}
