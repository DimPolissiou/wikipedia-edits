Following the independence of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the late 20th century, issues of Macedonian national identity have become contested by the country's neighbours, as some adherents to aggressive Macedonian nationalism, called ''Macedonism'', hold more extreme beliefs such as an unbroken continuity between [[ancient Macedonians]] (essentially an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[people]]), and modern ethnic Macedonians (a [[Slavs|Slavic]] people), and views connected to the [[Irredentism|irredentist]] concept of a [[United Macedonia]], which involves territorial claims on a large portion of [[Greece]], along with smaller regions of [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Serbia]].\n\n==The designation \"Macedonian\"==\n[[File:Pejchinovich-ogledalo.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''Ogledalo'' issued by [[Kiril Peychinovich]] and printed in 1816 in Budapest.

Early Macedonian nationalists were encouraged by several foreign governments that held interests in the region. The Serbian government came to believe that any attempt to forcibly assimilate Slavic Macedonians into Serbs in order to incorporate Macedonia would be unsuccessful, given the strong Bulgarian influence in the region. Instead, the Serbian government believed that providing support to Macedonian nationalists would stimulate opposition to incorporation into Bulgaria and favourable attitudes to Serbia. Another country that encouraged Macedonian nationalism was [[Austria-Hungary]] that sought to deny both Serbia and Bulgaria the ability to annex Macedonia, and asserted a distinct ethnic character of Slavic Macedonians.<ref name=\"Tchavdar Marinov 2013. P. 318\"/> In the 1890s, Russian supporters of a Slavic Macedonian ethnicity emerged, Russian-made ethnic maps began showing a Slavic Macedonian ethnicity, and Macedonian nationalists began to move to Russia to mobilize.<ref name=\"Tchavdar Marinov 2013. P. 318\"/>\n\nThe origins of the definition of an ethnic Slav Macedonian identity arose from the writings of [[Georgi Pulevski]] in the 1870s and 1880s, who identified the existence of a distinct modern \"Slavic Macedonian\" language that he defined as different from the other languages in that it had linguistic elements from [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Old Church Slavonic|Church Slavonic]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].<ref name=\"Tchavdar Marinov 2013. p. 300\">Roumen Daskalov and Tchavdar Marinov. ''Entangled Histories of the Balkans: Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies''. BRILL, 2013. p. 300.</ref> Pulevski analyzed the [[People's history|folk histories]] of the Slavic Macedonian people, in which he concluded that Slavic Macedonians were ethnically linked to the people of the ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Kingdom of Macedonia]] of Philip and [[Alexander the Great]] based on the claim that the ancient Macedonian language had Slavic components in it and thus the ancient Macedonians were Slavic, and modern-day Slavic Macedonians were their descendants.<ref name=\"Tchavdar Marinov 2013. p. 316\">Roumen Daskalov and Tchavdar Marinov. ''Entangled Histories of the Balkans: Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies''. BRILL, 2013. p. 316.</ref> However, Slavic Macedonians' self-identification and nationalist loyalties remained ambiguous in the late 19th century. Pulevski for instance viewed Macedonians' identity as being a regional phenomenon (similar to [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinians]] and [[Thrace|Thracians]]).

Yugoslavia: A History of Its Demise. p. 179.</ref> The IMRO initially opposed being dependent on any of the neighbouring states, especially Greece and Serbia, however its relationship with Bulgaria grew very strong, and it soon became dominated by figures who supported the annexation of Macedonia into Bulgaria, though a small fraction opposed this.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> As a rule, the IMRO members had Bulgarian national self-identification, but the autonomist faction stimulated the development of Macedonian nationalism.<ref>Entangled Histories of the Balkans: Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies, Balkan Studies Library, Roumen Dontchev Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov, BRILL, 2013, {{ISBN|900425076X}}, pp. 300\u2013303.</ref> It devised the slogan \"Macedonia for the Macedonians\" and called for a supranational Macedonia, consisting of different nationalities and eventually included in a future [[Balkan Federation]].<ref name=\"Tchavdar Marinov 2013. p. 300\"/> However, the promoters of this slogan declared their conviction that the majority of the Macedonian Christian Slav population was Bulgarian.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century the international community viewed the Macedonians predominantly as a regional variety of the Bulgarians. At the end of the First World War there were very few ethnographers who agreed that a separate Macedonian nation existed.

You, the only Lord, dearest God which is in Heaven, listen to our prayer, come to Armageddon, lend us a hand and tell us the truth about the evil and the good, to us and to the whole world, because no more blood left in us, for the great mother - Macedonia.\n\n\"God\" is supposed to say the following:\n\n3:48\u20135:16 Divine blessing for you, my Macedonians. I have waited for thousands of years to be called by you. From always with you, from eternity I am coming, I am already among you because here neither time nor space exists. Here, at my place, the time is still. But at your place, the time is now, for me to explain. Your mother Earth I have inhabited with three races: the White-Macedonoids, the Yellow-Mongoloids and the Black-Negroids. The rest-all are mulattoes. From you, Macedonians, the descendants of Macedon, I have impregnated the White race and everything began from you, to the Sea of Japan. All White people are your brothers because they carry Macedonian gene. And all the migrations started from your place towards the north. Kokino, Porodin, Radobor, Angelci, Barutnica, Govrlevo, wherever you dig you shall find the truth who you are, why you are and from where are you. Evil diabolic souls obscured the truth for thousands of years and lied to the world.\n\n5:19\u20136:37 How much did you suffered and to what kind of plights did you passed, because I was sending you temptations, but you have stayed faithful, my children. Children of the sun and of the flowers, blessed with the joy, love and goodness. I send you Tsars for thousands of years and now I am giving you again. You are giving them to everybody, you didn't left them for you. How many Tsars are here with Me and how many Macedonians are, so many stars are on the heaven and sand in the sea is. Let all the Angels sing, for everybody who are with Me, who from love for Macedonia, exchanged their life for eternity and shared the Tsardom here with Me. Already the Angels are singing for all of you which understood God's glory, for all of you to which I gave a part of Paradise, for all of you I gifted with love and peace, for all of you which waited for Me and have seen My arrival.\n\n6:40\u20138:23 Here, I am now coming to Macedonia, I am now among you, to tell you the truthful truth, which is among you under the soil. The grave of Alexander, the Macedonian Tsar, I shall open it, and the entire world at bowing in front of you I shall bring. How many Macedonian graves I have yet to open, because souls near me desire the truth. Love your greatest enemies, because I send them to be of greatest help to you. The truth about Macedonia and you, Macedonians should be known to the world. Because you were first among the firsts, most dignified among the most dignified. Now the Macedonian era arrived, the whole world to obtain the truth, to see that honor and blessing is to be a Macedonian, a descendant of Macedon and son of the God of Universe. Children of mine, blessed and eternal be, here where the sun and flowers rule, let there be eternal joy, love and goodness. Among you, I am now noble. In eternal Macedonia, blessed One, amen!</ref>\nThis ultra-nationalism accompanied by the emphasizing of North Macedonia's ancient roots has raised concerns internationally about growing a kind of authoritarianism by the governing party.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/world/europe/concerns-grow-about-authoritarianism-in-macedonia.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2sm |title=Concerns Grow About Authoritarianism in Macedonia |author=Matthew Brunnwasser|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 13, 2011|accessdate=2015-09-04}}</ref> There have also been attempts at scientific claims about ancient nationhood, but they have had a negative impact on the international position of the country.<ref name=\"Vangelia\">{{cite journal|title=Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia|journal=Nationalities Papers|pages=13\u201332|volume=39|date=2011|doi=10.1080/00905992.2010.532775|last1 = Vangeli|first1 = Anastas}}</ref> On the other hand, there is still strong [[Yugonostalgia]] among the ethnic Macedonian population, that has swept also over other ex-Yugoslav states.\n\nMacedonian nationalism also has support among high-ranking diplomats of North Macedonia who are serving abroad, and this continues to affect the relations with neighbors, especially Greece.

The creation of the Macedonian nation, for almost half of a century, was done in a condition of single-party dictatorship. In those times, there was no difference between science and ideology, so the Macedonian historiography, unopposed by anybody, comfortably performed a selection of the historic material from which the Macedonian identity was created. There is nothing atypical here for the process of the creation of any modern nation, except when falsification from the type of substitution of the word \"Bulgarian\" with the word \"Macedonian\" were made. In a case which that was not possible, the persons from history were proclaimed for Bulgarian agents who crossed into some imaginary pure Macedonian space. But when we had to encourage the moderate Greek political variant and move into a direction of reconciliation among peoples, our nationalism was modelled according to the Greek one. The direct descendants of Alexander the Great raised the fallen flag on which the constitutional name of the Republic of Macedonia was written and led the people in the final confrontation with the Greeks, the direct descendants of Greek gods. This warlike attitude of the \"winners\" which was a consequence of the fear of politicians from heavy and unpopular compromises had its price. In those years, we lost our capability for strategic dialog. With Greeks? No, with ourselves. Since then, namely, we reach towards some fictional ethnic purity which we seek in the depths of the history and we are angry at those which dare to call us Slavs and our language and culture Slavic!?

It was originally used in a contemptuous manner to refer to Slav Macedonians, who believed they constituted a distinct [[ethnic group]], separate from their neighbours.

However, he pointed out that he had heard for the first time of such ideas as early as 10 years prior, i.e. around 1860. Slaveykov sharply criticised those Macedonians espousing such views, as they had never shown a substantial basis for their attitudes, calling them \"Macedonists\".<ref>\"We have many times heard from the Macedonists that they are not Bulgarians but Macedonians, descendants of the ancient Macedonians, and we have always waited to hear some proofs of this, but we have never heard them.

In his ethnographic studies of the Balkan Slavs, Cvijic devised a \"''Central Type''\" (Slav Macedonians and [[Torlaks]]), dissimilar at the same time to the \"''Dinaric Type''\" (the principal \"Serb\" ethnographic variant) and the \"''East Balkan Type''\" (representing the Bulgarians, but excluding even Western Bulgaria). The true Bulgarians belonged only to the \"East Balkan Type\" and were a mixture of [[Early Slavs|Slavs]], \"[[Turanian]]\" groups ([[Bulgars]], [[Cumans]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]]) and [[Vlachs]], and as such, were different from the other [[South Slavs]] in their ethnic composition. More importantly, their national character was decidedly un-Slavic. Bulgarians were industrious and coarse. They were a people without imagination and therefore necessarily without art and culture. This caricature of the Bulgarians permitted their clear differentiation from the \"Central Type,\" within which Cvijic included Macedonian Slavs, western Bulgarians ([[Shopi]]), and Torlaks, a type that was eminently Slavic (i.e. old-Serbian) and therefore non-Bulgarian. Nowadays, these outdated Serbian views have been propagandized by some contemporary Macedonian scholars and politicians.\n\nSome panslavic ideologists in [[Russia]], former supporter of [[Greater Bulgaria]], also adopted these ideas as opposing Bulgaria's [[Russophobic]] policy at the beginning of the 20th century, as for example [[Aleksandr Fyodorovich Rittikh|Alexandr Rittikh]]<ref>20.11.1914 \"\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043ai\u0439 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044a\" - \u041a\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0446\u044b?</ref> and [[Aleksandr Amfiteatrov]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the continued Serbian propaganda efforts had managed to firmly entrench the concept of the Macedonian Slavs in European public opinion and the name was used almost as frequently as Bulgarians. Simultaneously, the proponents of the Greek [[Struggle for Macedonia]], such as [[Germanos Karavangelis]], openly popularized the [[Hellenisation|Hellenic]] idea about a direct link between the local Slavs and the [[ancient Macedonians]].<ref>This theory has its deep roots into the Greek policy on Macedonia, which may be noticed in the address of Archbishop [[Germanos Karavangelis]] and his advice to [[Konstantinos Christou]]. In his memories entitled as \"Macedonian Struggle\", Archbishop Karavangelis, wrote: \"You have been Greeks since the time of Alexander the Great, but the Slavs came and slavicized you.

The creation of a [[Balkan Socialist Federation]] was proposed, in which Macedonia would be a constituent state. In 1915, after the Balkan Wars had concluded, the Balkan Socialist Conference in Bucharest agreed to create a Balkan Socialist Federation, and that divided from the \"imperialists\" Macedonia would be united into its framework. This ideology later found fruition with the support of the [[Soviet Union]] as a project of the Yugoslav communist federation. Various declarations were made during the 1920s and 1930s seeing the official adoption of Macedonism by the [[Comintern]]. In turn declarations were made by the Greek, Yugoslav and Bulgarian communist parties, as they agreed on its adoption as their official policy for the region. Also, the demise of the IMRO and its ideology for much of the interwar period led a part of the young local intellectuals in [[Vardar Macedonia]], regarded at that time as Serbs, to find a solution in the ideology of Macedonism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yLfmoaeWukC&pg=PA453 |title=Bulgaria - Jonathan Bousfield, Dan Richardson |page=453 |accessdate=2015-09-04|isbn=9781858288826 |last1=Bousfield |first1=Jonathan |last2=Richardson |first2=Dan |year=2002 }}</ref> This issue was supported during the Second World War by the Communist Resistance and in 1944 the wartime Communist leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] proclaimed the [[People's Republic of Macedonia]] as part of the [[Yugoslav Federation]], thus partially fulfilling the Comintern's pre-war policy.

Representatives of this circle were [[Georgi Pulevski]], [[Theodosius of Skopje]], [[Krste Misirkov]], [[Stefan Dedov]], [[Atanas Razdolov]], [[Dimitrija Chupovski]] and others. Nearly all of them died in Bulgaria. Most of the next wave Macedonists were [[left-wing]] politicians, who changed their ethnic affiliations from Bulgarian to Macedonian during the 1930s, after the recognition of the Macedonian ethnicity by the [[Comintern]], as for example [[Dimitar Vlahov]], [[Pavel Shatev]], [[Panko Brashnarov]], [[Venko Markovski]], [[Georgi Pirinski, Sr.]] and others.

The idea evolved during the early 20th century alongside the first expressions of ethnic nationalism among the [[Slavs]] of Macedonia. The separate Macedonian nation gained recognition after World War II when the \"[[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]\" was created as part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Afterwards the [[Historiography in the Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian historiography]] has established historical links between the ethnic Macedonians and events and figures from the Middle Ages up to the 20th century. Following the independence of the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the late 20th century, issues of Macedonian national identity have become contested by the country's neighbours, as some adherents to aggressive Macedonian nationalism, called ''Macedonism'', hold more extreme beliefs such as an unbroken continuity between [[ancient Macedonians]] (essentially an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[people]]), and modern ethnic Macedonians (a [[Slavs|Slavic]] people), and views connected to the [[Irredentism|irredentist]] concept of a [[United Macedonia]], which involves territorial claims on a large portion of [[Greece]], along with smaller regions of [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Serbia]].\n\n==The designation \"Macedonian\"==\n[[File:Pejchinovich-ogledalo.jpg|left|thumb|250px|''Ogledalo'' issued by [[Kiril Peychinovich]] and printed in 1816 in Budapest.

Early Macedonian nationalists were encouraged by several foreign governments that held interests in the region. The Serbian government came to believe that any attempt to forcibly assimilate Slavic Macedonians into Serbs in order to incorporate Macedonia would be unsuccessful, given the strong Bulgarian influence in the region. Instead, the Serbian government believed that providing support to Macedonian nationalists would stimulate opposition to incorporation into Bulgaria and favourable attitudes to Serbia. Another country that encouraged Macedonian nationalism was [[Austria-Hungary]] that sought to deny both Serbia and Bulgaria the ability to annex Macedonia, and asserted a distinct ethnic character of Slavic Macedonians.<ref name=\"Tchavdar Marinov 2013. P. 318\"/> In the 1890s, Russian supporters of a Slavic Macedonian ethnicity emerged, Russian-made ethnic maps began showing a Slavic Macedonian ethnicity, and Macedonian nationalists began to move to Russia to mobilize.<ref name=\"Tchavdar Marinov 2013. P. 318\"/>\n\nThe origins of the definition of an ethnic Slav Macedonian identity arose from the writings of [[Georgi Pulevski]] in the 1870s and 1880s, who identified the existence of a distinct modern \"Slavic Macedonian\" language that he defined as different from the other languages in that it had linguistic elements from [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Old Church Slavonic|Church Slavonic]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].<ref name=\"Tchavdar Marinov 2013. p. 300\">Roumen Daskalov and Tchavdar Marinov. ''Entangled Histories of the Balkans: Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies''. BRILL, 2013. p. 300.</ref> Pulevski analyzed the [[People's history|folk histories]] of the Slavic Macedonian people, in which he concluded that Slavic Macedonians were ethnically linked to the people of the ancient [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Kingdom of Macedonia]] of Philip and [[Alexander the Great]] based on the claim that the ancient Macedonian language had Slavic components in it and thus the ancient Macedonians were Slavic, and modern-day Slavic Macedonians were their descendants.<ref name=\"Tchavdar Marinov 2013. p. 316\">Roumen Daskalov and Tchavdar Marinov. ''Entangled Histories of the Balkans: Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies''. BRILL, 2013. p. 316.</ref> However, Slavic Macedonians' self-identification and nationalist loyalties remained ambiguous in the late 19th century. Pulevski for instance viewed Macedonians' identity as being a regional phenomenon (similar to [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinians]] and [[Thrace|Thracians]]).

Yugoslavia: A History of Its Demise. p. 179.</ref> The IMRO initially opposed being dependent on any of the neighbouring states, especially Greece and Serbia, however its relationship with Bulgaria grew very strong, and it soon became dominated by figures who supported the annexation of Macedonia into Bulgaria, though a small fraction opposed this.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> As a rule, the IMRO members had Bulgarian national self-identification, but the autonomist faction stimulated the development of Macedonian nationalism.<ref>Entangled Histories of the Balkans: Volume One: National Ideologies and Language Policies, Balkan Studies Library, Roumen Dontchev Daskalov, Tchavdar Marinov, BRILL, 2013, {{ISBN|900425076X}}, pp. 300\u2013303.</ref> It devised the slogan \"Macedonia for the Macedonians\" and called for a supranational Macedonia, consisting of different nationalities and eventually included in a future [[Balkan Federation]].<ref name=\"Tchavdar Marinov 2013. p. 300\"/> However, the promoters of this slogan declared their conviction that the majority of the Macedonian Christian Slav population was Bulgarian.\n\nIn the late 19th and early 20th century the international community viewed the Macedonians predominantly as a regional variety of the Bulgarians. At the end of the First World War there were very few ethnographers who agreed that a separate Macedonian nation existed.

You, the only Lord, dearest God which is in Heaven, listen to our prayer, come to Armageddon, lend us a hand and tell us the truth about the evil and the good, to us and to the whole world, because no more blood left in us, for the great mother - Macedonia.\n\n\"God\" is supposed to say the following:\n\n3:48\u20135:16 Divine blessing for you, my Macedonians. I have waited for thousands of years to be called by you. From always with you, from eternity I am coming, I am already among you because here neither time nor space exists. Here, at my place, the time is still. But at your place, the time is now, for me to explain. Your mother Earth I have inhabited with three races: the White-Macedonoids, the Yellow-Mongoloids and the Black-Negroids. The rest-all are mulattoes. From you, Macedonians, the descendants of Macedon, I have impregnated the White race and everything began from you, to the Sea of Japan. All White people are your brothers because they carry Macedonian gene. And all the migrations started from your place towards the north. Kokino, Porodin, Radobor, Angelci, Barutnica, Govrlevo, wherever you dig you shall find the truth who you are, why you are and from where are you. Evil diabolic souls obscured the truth for thousands of years and lied to the world.\n\n5:19\u20136:37 How much did you suffered and to what kind of plights did you passed, because I was sending you temptations, but you have stayed faithful, my children. Children of the sun and of the flowers, blessed with the joy, love and goodness. I send you Tsars for thousands of years and now I am giving you again. You are giving them to everybody, you didn't left them for you. How many Tsars are here with Me and how many Macedonians are, so many stars are on the heaven and sand in the sea is. Let all the Angels sing, for everybody who are with Me, who from love for Macedonia, exchanged their life for eternity and shared the Tsardom here with Me. Already the Angels are singing for all of you which understood God's glory, for all of you to which I gave a part of Paradise, for all of you I gifted with love and peace, for all of you which waited for Me and have seen My arrival.\n\n6:40\u20138:23 Here, I am now coming to Macedonia, I am now among you, to tell you the truthful truth, which is among you under the soil. The grave of Alexander, the Macedonian Tsar, I shall open it, and the entire world at bowing in front of you I shall bring. How many Macedonian graves I have yet to open, because souls near me desire the truth. Love your greatest enemies, because I send them to be of greatest help to you. The truth about Macedonia and you, Macedonians should be known to the world. Because you were first among the firsts, most dignified among the most dignified. Now the Macedonian era arrived, the whole world to obtain the truth, to see that honor and blessing is to be a Macedonian, a descendant of Macedon and son of the God of Universe. Children of mine, blessed and eternal be, here where the sun and flowers rule, let there be eternal joy, love and goodness. Among you, I am now noble. In eternal Macedonia, blessed One, amen!</ref>\nThis ultra-nationalism accompanied by the emphasizing of North Macedonia's ancient roots has raised concerns internationally about growing a kind of authoritarianism by the governing party.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/world/europe/concerns-grow-about-authoritarianism-in-macedonia.html?pagewanted=1&_r=2sm |title=Concerns Grow About Authoritarianism in Macedonia |author=Matthew Brunnwasser|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 13, 2011|accessdate=2015-09-04}}</ref> There have also been attempts at scientific claims about ancient nationhood, but they have had a negative impact on the international position of the country.<ref name=\"Vangelia\">{{cite journal|title=Nation-building ancient Macedonian style: the origins and the effects of the so-called antiquization in Macedonia|journal=Nationalities Papers|pages=13\u201332|volume=39|date=2011|doi=10.1080/00905992.2010.532775|last1 = Vangeli|first1 = Anastas}}</ref> On the other hand, there is still strong [[Yugonostalgia]] among the ethnic Macedonian population, that has swept also over other ex-Yugoslav states.\n\nMacedonian nationalism also has support among high-ranking diplomats of North Macedonia who are serving abroad, and this continues to affect the relations with neighbors, especially Greece.

The creation of the Macedonian nation, for almost half of a century, was done in a condition of single-party dictatorship. In those times, there was no difference between science and ideology, so the Macedonian historiography, unopposed by anybody, comfortably performed a selection of the historic material from which the Macedonian identity was created. There is nothing atypical here for the process of the creation of any modern nation, except when falsification from the type of substitution of the word \"Bulgarian\" with the word \"Macedonian\" were made. In a case which that was not possible, the persons from history were proclaimed for Bulgarian agents who crossed into some imaginary pure Macedonian space. But when we had to encourage the moderate Greek political variant and move into a direction of reconciliation among peoples, our nationalism was modelled according to the Greek one. The direct descendants of Alexander the Great raised the fallen flag on which the constitutional name of the Republic of Macedonia was written and led the people in the final confrontation with the Greeks, the direct descendants of Greek gods. This warlike attitude of the \"winners\" which was a consequence of the fear of politicians from heavy and unpopular compromises had its price. In those years, we lost our capability for strategic dialog. With Greeks? No, with ourselves. Since then, namely, we reach towards some fictional ethnic purity which we seek in the depths of the history and we are angry at those which dare to call us Slavs and our language and culture Slavic!?

It was originally used in a contemptuous manner to refer to Slav Macedonians, who believed they constituted a distinct [[ethnic group]], separate from their neighbours.

However, he pointed out that he had heard for the first time of such ideas as early as 10 years prior, i.e. around 1860. Slaveykov sharply criticised those Macedonians espousing such views, as they had never shown a substantial basis for their attitudes, calling them \"Macedonists\".<ref>\"We have many times heard from the Macedonists that they are not Bulgarians but Macedonians, descendants of the ancient Macedonians, and we have always waited to hear some proofs of this, but we have never heard them.

In his ethnographic studies of the Balkan Slavs, Cvijic devised a \"''Central Type''\" (Slav Macedonians and [[Torlaks]]), dissimilar at the same time to the \"''Dinaric Type''\" (the principal \"Serb\" ethnographic variant) and the \"''East Balkan Type''\" (representing the Bulgarians, but excluding even Western Bulgaria). The true Bulgarians belonged only to the \"East Balkan Type\" and were a mixture of [[Early Slavs|Slavs]], \"[[Turanian]]\" groups ([[Bulgars]], [[Cumans]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]]) and [[Vlachs]], and as such, were different from the other [[South Slavs]] in their ethnic composition. More importantly, their national character was decidedly un-Slavic. Bulgarians were industrious and coarse. They were a people without imagination and therefore necessarily without art and culture. This caricature of the Bulgarians permitted their clear differentiation from the \"Central Type,\" within which Cvijic included Macedonian Slavs, western Bulgarians ([[Shopi]]), and Torlaks, a type that was eminently Slavic (i.e. old-Serbian) and therefore non-Bulgarian. Nowadays, these outdated Serbian views have been propagandized by some contemporary Macedonian scholars and politicians.\n\nSome panslavic ideologists in [[Russia]], former supporter of [[Greater Bulgaria]], also adopted these ideas as opposing Bulgaria's [[Russophobic]] policy at the beginning of the 20th century, as for example [[Aleksandr Fyodorovich Rittikh|Alexandr Rittikh]]<ref>20.11.1914 \"\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043ai\u0439 \u0413\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441\u044a\" - \u041a\u0442\u043e \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0446\u044b?</ref> and [[Aleksandr Amfiteatrov]]. At the beginning of the 20th century, the continued Serbian propaganda efforts had managed to firmly entrench the concept of the Macedonian Slavs in European public opinion and the name was used almost as frequently as Bulgarians. Simultaneously, the proponents of the Greek [[Struggle for Macedonia]], such as [[Germanos Karavangelis]], openly popularized the [[Hellenisation|Hellenic]] idea about a direct link between the local Slavs and the [[ancient Macedonians]].<ref>This theory has its deep roots into the Greek policy on Macedonia, which may be noticed in the address of Archbishop [[Germanos Karavangelis]] and his advice to [[Konstantinos Christou]]. In his memories entitled as \"Macedonian Struggle\", Archbishop Karavangelis, wrote: \"You have been Greeks since the time of Alexander the Great, but the Slavs came and slavicized you.

The creation of a [[Balkan Socialist Federation]] was proposed, in which Macedonia would be a constituent state. In 1915, after the Balkan Wars had concluded, the Balkan Socialist Conference in Bucharest agreed to create a Balkan Socialist Federation, and that divided from the \"imperialists\" Macedonia would be united into its framework. This ideology later found fruition with the support of the [[Soviet Union]] as a project of the Yugoslav communist federation. Various declarations were made during the 1920s and 1930s seeing the official adoption of Macedonism by the [[Comintern]]. In turn declarations were made by the Greek, Yugoslav and Bulgarian communist parties, as they agreed on its adoption as their official policy for the region. Also, the demise of the IMRO and its ideology for much of the interwar period led a part of the young local intellectuals in [[Vardar Macedonia]], regarded at that time as Serbs, to find a solution in the ideology of Macedonism.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yLfmoaeWukC&pg=PA453 |title=Bulgaria - Jonathan Bousfield, Dan Richardson |page=453 |accessdate=2015-09-04|isbn=9781858288826 |last1=Bousfield |first1=Jonathan |last2=Richardson |first2=Dan |year=2002 }}</ref> This issue was supported during the Second World War by the Communist Resistance and in 1944 the wartime Communist leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] proclaimed the [[People's Republic of Macedonia]] as part of the [[Yugoslav Federation]], thus partially fulfilling the Comintern's pre-war policy.

Representatives of this circle were [[Georgi Pulevski]], [[Theodosius of Skopje]], [[Krste Misirkov]], [[Stefan Dedov]], [[Atanas Razdolov]], [[Dimitrija Chupovski]] and others. Nearly all of them died in Bulgaria. Most of the next wave Macedonists were [[left-wing]] politicians, who changed their ethnic affiliations from Bulgarian to Macedonian during the 1930s, after the recognition of the Macedonian ethnicity by the [[Comintern]], as for example [[Dimitar Vlahov]], [[Pavel Shatev]], [[Panko Brashnarov]], [[Venko Markovski]], [[Georgi Pirinski, Sr.]] and others.

Though his work ranged from high drama to absurdist farce, Anouilh is best known for his 1944 play ''[[Antigone (Anouilh)|Antigone]]'', an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' classical drama, that was seen as an attack on [[Philippe P\u00e9tain|Marshal P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France|Vichy government]]. His plays are less experimental than those of his contemporaries, having clearly organized plot and eloquent dialogue.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia Of The Arts|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0198691372|location=USA|pages=18}}</ref> One of France's most prolific writers after World War II, much of Anouilh's work deals with themes of maintaining integrity in a world of moral compromise.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life===\nAnouilh was born in C\u00e9risole, a small village on the outskirts of [[Bordeaux]], and had [[Basque people|Basque]] ancestry. His father, Fran\u00e7ois Anouilh, was a tailor, and Anouilh maintained that he inherited from him a pride in conscientious craftmanship. He may owe his artistic bent to his mother, Marie-Magdeleine, a violinist who supplemented the family's meager income by playing summer seasons in the casino orchestra in the nearby seaside resort of [[Arcachon]]. Marie-Magdeleine worked the night shifts in the music-hall orchestras and sometimes accompanied stage presentations, affording Anouilh ample opportunity to absorb the dramatic performances from backstage. He often attended rehearsals and solicited the resident authors to let him read scripts until bedtime. He first tried his hand at playwriting here, at the age of 12, though his earliest works do not survive.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/>\n\n[[Image:lyc\u00e9e chaptal.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Lyc\u00e9e Chaptal]], at the corner of rue de Rome and the boulevard des Batignolles]]\n\nIn 1918 the family moved to Paris where the young Anouilh received his secondary education at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Chaptal]]. [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], later a major French director, was a pupil there at the same time and recalls Anouilh as an intense, rather dandified figure who hardly noticed a boy some two years younger than himself. He earned acceptance into the law school at the [[Sorbonne]] but, unable to support himself financially, he left after just 18 months to seek work as a copywriter at the advertising agency Publicit\u00e9 Damour. He liked the work, and spoke more than once with wry approval of the lessons in the classical virtues of brevity and precision of language he learned while drafting advertising copy.<ref name=\"Liukkonen\"/>\n\nAnouilh's financial troubles continued after he was called up to military service in 1929.  Supported by only his meager conscription salary, Anouilh married the actress Monelle Valentin in 1931. Though Valentin starred in many of his plays, Anouilh's daughter Caroline (from his second marriage), claims that the marriage was not a happy one. Anouilh's youngest daughter Colombe even claims that there was never an official marriage between Anouilh and Valentin. She allegedly had multiple extramarital affairs, which caused Anouilh much pain and suffering.  The infidelity weighed heavily on the dramatist as a result of the uncertainty about his own parentage. According to Caroline, Anouilh had learned that his mother had had a lover at the theatre in Arcachon who was actually his biological father. In spite of this, Anouilh and Valentin had a daughter, Catherine, in 1934 who followed the pair into theatre work at an early age. Anouilh's growing family placed further strain on his already limited finances. Determined to break into writing full-time, he began to write comic scenes for the cinema to supplement their income.<ref name=\"AnouilhCaroline\"/>\n\n===Theatre work===\nAt the age of 25, Anouilh found work as a secretary to the French actor and director [[Louis Jouvet]] at the Com\u00e9die des Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Though Anouilh's boss had happily lent him some of the set furniture left over from the production of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s  play ''Siegfried'' to furnish his modest home, the director was not interested in encouraging his assistant's attempts at playwriting.<ref name=\"Falb\"/> Jouvet had risen to fame in the early 1930s through his collaborations with the playwright Giraudoux, and together the two worked to shift focus from the authorial voice of the director (which had dominated the French stage since the early twentieth century) back to the playwright and his text.\n\nGiraudoux was an inspiration to Anouilh and, with the encouragement of the acclaimed playwright, he began writing again in 1929. Before the end of the year he made his theatrical debut with ''Humulus le muet'', a collaborative project with [[Jean Aurenche]]. It was followed by his first solo projects, ''L'Hermine'' (''The Ermine'') in 1932 and ''Mandarine'' in 1933, both produced by [[Aur\u00e9lien Lugn\u00e9-Poe]], an innovative actor and stage manager who was then head of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre]].<ref name=\"Levi\"/> Ruled by the philosophy, \"the word creates the decor,\" Lugn\u00e9-Poe let Anouilh's lyrical prose shine in front of a backdrop of simple compositions of line and color that created a unity of style and mood.<ref name=\"Brockett442\"/>\n\nThe plays were not great successes, closing after 37 and 13 performances respectively, but Anouilh persevered, following it up with a string of productions, most notably ''Y'avait un prisonnier'' (1935). These works, most in collaboration with the experimental Russian director [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]], were considered promising despite their lack of commercial profits, and the duo continued to work together until they had their first major success in 1937 with ''[[Le voyageur sans bagage]]'' (''Traveller Without Luggage''). In subsequent years, there was rarely a season in Paris that did not prominently feature a new Anouilh play and many of these were also being exported to England and America.<ref name=\"Pronko\"/> After 1938, however, much of Anouilh's later work was directed by the prominent Paris scenic designer [[Andr\u00e9 Barsacq]], who had taken over as director of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Atelier]] after [[Charles Dullin]]'s retirement in 1940.  Barsacq was a champion for Anouilh and their affiliation was a major factor in the playwright's continued success after the war.<ref name=\"Brockett458485\"/>\n\n===Playwright===\nIn the 1940s, Anouilh turned from contemporary tales to more mythical, classic, and historic subjects.  With protagonists who asserted their independence from the fated past, themes during this period are more closely related to the existential concerns of such writers as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]]. The most famous play of this group is ''Antigone'', which \"established Anouilh as a leading dramatist, not only because of the power with which he drew the classic confrontation between the uncompromising Antigone and the politically expedient Creon, but also because French theatre-goers under the occupation read the play as a contemporary political parable.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/> His post-war plays dealt with similar concerns and included ''Rom\u00e9o et Jeannette'', ''M\u00e9d\u00e9e'' (''Medea''), and Anouilh's [[Joan of Arc]] story ''L'Alouette'' (''[[The Lark (play)|The Lark]]''), which, in its distinct optimism, rivalled the commercial success of ''Antigone''.\n\nAnouilh himself grouped his plays of this period on the basis of their dominant tone, publishing his later works in collected volumes to reflect what he felt \"represented the phases of his evolution and loosely resembled the distinction between comedy and tragedy.\"<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/> ''Pi\u00e8ces noires'' or \"Black plays\" were tragedies or realistic dramas and included ''Antigone'', ''J\u00e9zabel'', and ''La Sauvage'' (''The Restless Heart'').  This category typically featured \"young,  idealistic, and uncompromising protagonists [who] are able to maintain their integrity only by choosing death.\"<ref name=\"Brockett483\"/>  By contrast, Anouilh's ''pi\u00e8ces roses'' or \"pink plays\" were comedies where fantasy dominated with an atmosphere similar to that of fairy tales. In these plays such as ''Le Bal des voleurs'' (''Carnival of Thieves''), ''Le Rendez-vous de Senlis'' (''Dinner with the Family'') and ''[[L\u00e9ocadia]]'' (''Time Remembered''), the focus is on \"the burden of the environment and especially of the past on a protagonist seeking a happier, freer existence.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nMost of Anouilh's plays of the late 1940s and into the 1950s become darker and distinctly cruel and, in contrast with his earlier works, begin to feature middle-aged characters who must view life more practically than Anouilh's former idealistic youths. The playwright divided the works of this period into ''pi\u00e8ces brillantes'' (\"brilliant plays\") and ''pi\u00e8ces grin\u00e7antes'' (\"grating plays\"). The first group includes works such as ''L'Invitation au ch\u00e2teau'' (Ring Round the Moon) and ''Colombe'', and are typified by aristocratic settings and witty banter. The grating plays like ''[[The Waltz of the Toreadors|La Valse des tor\u00e9adors]]'' (''Waltz of the Toreadors'') and ''Le R\u00e9actionnaire amoureux'' (''The Fighting Cock'') are more bitterly funny, trading clever word play for a darker tone of disillusionment.\n\nAnother category Anouilh specifies are his ''pi\u00e8ces costum\u00e9es'' (\"costume plays\") which include ''The Lark'', ''La Foire d'Empoigne'' (''Catch as Catch Can''), and [[Becket]], an international success, depicting the historical martyr [[Thomas Becket]], the Archbishop of Canterbury who sought to defend the church against the monarch (and his friend), [[Henry II of England]], who had appointed him to his see. So classified because they share historical \"costumed\" settings, Anouilh also specifies that these plays must also prominently feature an enlightened protagonist seeking \"a moral path in a world of corruption and manipulation.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nAnouilh's final period begins with ''La Grotte'' (''The Cavern''), in which he comments on his own progress as a writer and a theatre artist. The central character is a playwright suffering from writer's block who in his frustration recalls the foibles of [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''. Anouilh's work had always contained hints of [[metatheatre|metatheatricality]], or commentary on the business of theatre within the world of the play, but in his late works these structures became more fully developed as he begins to write primarily about character who are dramatists or theatre directors. There is also a pronounced link, during this time, of Anouilh's emphasis of theatre and the family, displaying intimate relationships that are \"more profound and more important than the traditional heightened action of 'theatre'&thinsp;\".{{whose quote|dated=October 2016}} Antoine, the playwright-protagonist of ''Cher Antoine; ou, L'Amour rat\u00e9'' (''Dear Antoine; or, The Love That Failed''), asserts that the world must take notice of these ''pi\u00e8ces secr\u00e8tes'' (secret dramas) and Anouilh scholars have proposed this name, ''pi\u00e8ces secr\u00e8tes'', to classify the collected works of his latest period.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>{{clarify|date=October 2016}}<!--one double-quotation mark missing; quotation uncertain.-->\n\n===Political controversy===\nAnouilh remained staunchly apolitical for most of his life and career. He served in the military during at least two periods, having been drafted into the French Army in 1931 and 1939. He was a prisoner of war for a short time when the Germans conquered France and willingly lived and worked in Paris during the subsequent [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]]. Because he refused to take sides during France's collaboration with the [[Axis Alliance]] some critics have branded him as a potential Nazi sympathiser.  This controversy escalated as a result of Anouilh's public clashes with leader of the [[Free French Forces]] (and later President of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]), [[Charles de Gaulle|General Charles de Gaulle]].  In the mid-1940s Anouilh and several other intellectuals signed a petition for clemency to save the writer [[Robert Brasillach]], who was condemned to death for being a Nazi collaborator. Brasillach was executed by firing squad in February 1945, despite the outcry from Anouilh and his peers that the new government had no right to persecute individuals for \"intellectual crimes\" in the absence of military or political action.<ref name=\"Kaplan\"/> Nevertheless, Anouilh refused to comment on his political views, writing in a letter to the Belgian critic Hubert Gignoux in 1946, \"I do not have a biography and I am very happy about it. The rest of my life, as long as God wills it, will remain my personal business, and I will withhold the details of it.\"<ref name=\"Ginestier\"/>\nAnouilh's plays provide the most important clues about his political point of view, though their reputation for ambiguity further complicates the matter. For instance ''Antigone'', provides an [[allegory|allegorical]] representation of the debate between the idealistic members of the [[French Resistance]] and the pragmatism of the collaborationists. Though many have read the play as having a strong anti-Nazi sentiment, the fact that the Vichy Regime allowed the piece to be performed without censure testifies to the fact that it was potentially seen as supportive of the occupation in its time.<ref name=\"Wiles\"/><ref name=\"Krauss\"/>  Though the playwright romanticizes Antigone's sense of honor and duty to what is morally right, in this case resisting the Nazi forces, it can also be said that Anouilh, like Sophocles before him, makes a convincing argument for Creon's method of leadership.<ref name=\"Smith2426\"/>\n\n===Awards and recognition===\nIn 1970 his work was recognized with the ''[[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]]''. In 2012, the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years and it was revealed that Anouilh was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], along with John Steinbeck (winner), [[Robert Graves]], [[Lawrence Durrell]] and [[Karen Blixen]].<ref name=floodjan2013>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/03/swedish-academy-controversy-steinbeck-nobel |title=Swedish Academy reopens controversy surrounding Steinbeck's Nobel prize |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Alison Flood |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}</ref> According to a report in ''The Guardian'', \"It is not clear why Anouilh was passed over, but the French poet [[Saint-John Perse]] had taken the Nobel in 1960, meaning that France was well represented on the roster of winners, and ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' reveals that [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who won the prize in 1964, was starting to be seriously considered as a candidate.\"<ref name=floodjan2013/>\n\nIn 1980, he was the first recipient of the [[Grand prix du th\u00e9\u00e2tre (Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise)|Grand Prix du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] established that year.\n\n==Critical discussion==\nBy the end of his career, Anouilh's reputation outstripped all his contemporaries. However, his repertoire remained unusually confined to theatre and film. Most French dramatists of the 1930s and 1940s, including Anouilh's most significant contemporary influence, Giraudoux, not only wrote for the stage but also composed poetry, novels, or essays.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/> Nevertheless, he remained prolific, consistently producing and publishing performance works for more than fifty years.\n\nAnouilh's early works were \"naturalistic studies of a sordid and corrupt world.\"<ref name=\"Liukkonen\"/> Many of these plays present the reader with the striking and inescapable dichotomy between pragmatism and a sort of transcendent idealism.  There is little to no \"middle ground of ambiguity\" that exists where this conflict asserts itself.<ref name=\"Pucciani\"/> This is evidenced in ''Le Voyageur Sans Bagage.'' The main character Gaston, a World War I veteran who suffers from amnesia, cannot remember the moral depravity of his youth (he slept with his brother's wife and severely injured his best friend). This checkered past is invariably at odds with the near-angelic behavior that he now exhibits, and recognition of this truth forces him to leave his former identity behind, unable to reconcile the two sides of himself. In denouncing his past, Gaston reclasses his freedom as an illusion, but one of his own making. He befriends a young English boy and shows him his identifying scar; this gesture allows the boy to describe Gaston to the authorities, thereby claiming him as kin. With a new life and a new family, Gaston has a fresh start.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/>  David I. Grossvogel, describes this situation as the \"restoration of a childhood paradise lost,\" attributing ''Le Voyageur Sans Bagage'' as the beginning of Anouilh's search to justify the unhappiness of his youth.<ref name=\"Grossvogel\"/> Theatre historian Marvin Carlson agrees, noting that this play epitomizes the \"complex tonality and deft dramatic technique\" that remained throughout his work, though, he asserts, it was only as the playwright matured that his \"dark view of the human condition [reached] its final expression.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nAnouilh disagreed with these somber readings of his best works, however, arguing that, like all great French literature, his plays had found ways to laugh at misfortune. \"Thanks to Moli\u00e8re,\" Anouilh said, \"the true French theatre is the only one that is not gloomy, in which we laugh like men at war with our misery and our horror. This humor is one of France's messages to the world.\"<ref name=\"Hotchman\"/>\n\nDisclosing his thoughts on French theatre and his personal perspective as a playwright, he said that the perception of his work was often misguided:\n\n{{quote|I am played in private theaters, so I write for the bourgeoisie.  One has to rely on the people who pay for their places; the people who support the theater are bourgeois.  But this public has changed:  They have such a terror of not being in touch, of missing out on a fashionable event that they no longer exist as a decisive force.  I think the public has lost its head.  They now say that a play can't be that good if they can understand it.  My plays are not hermetic enough.  It's rather Moli\u00e8resque, don't you think?|author=Jean Anouilh<ref name=\"Porter\"/>}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Anouilh examined his antagonism with General de Gaulle in ''L'Hurluberlu, ou Le Reactionnaire amoureux'' (1958) and ''Le Songe du critique'' (1960). He began to lose the favor of audiences and critics alike, however, with the emergence of such playwrights as [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] and [[Samuel Beckett]]. Though he shared with these authors a \"similar desperate vision of human existence,\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Liukkonen|first=Petri and Ari Pesonen|title=Jean Anouilh (1910-1987)}}</ref> these new absurdist theatres' pursuit of alternative dramaturgies made Anouilh's semi-realistic plays seem dull and old-fashioned. In the 1980s Anouilh reinvented himself as a director, staging his own plays as well as those of other authors. He died of a heart attack in Lausanne, Switzerland on 3 October 1987. By then divorced from Monelle Valentin, he was survived by his second wife, Nicole Lan\u00e7on, and four children.\n\n==Works==\n===Original theatre productions: Paris===\n* ''L'Hermine''.

Though his work ranged from high drama to absurdist farce, Anouilh is best known for his 1944 play ''[[Antigone (Anouilh)|Antigone]]'', an adaptation of [[Sophocles]]' classical drama, that was seen as an attack on [[Philippe P\u00e9tain|Marshal P\u00e9tain]]'s [[Vichy France|Vichy government]]. His plays are less experimental than those of his contemporaries, having clearly organized plot and eloquent dialogue.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia Of The Arts|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0198691372|location=USA|pages=18}}</ref> One of France's most prolific writers after World War II, much of Anouilh's work deals with themes of maintaining integrity in a world of moral compromise.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life===\nAnouilh was born in C\u00e9risole, a small village on the outskirts of [[Bordeaux]], and had [[Basque people|Basque]] ancestry. His father, Fran\u00e7ois Anouilh, was a tailor, and Anouilh maintained that he inherited from him a pride in conscientious craftmanship. He may owe his artistic bent to his mother, Marie-Magdeleine, a violinist who supplemented the family's meager income by playing summer seasons in the casino orchestra in the nearby seaside resort of [[Arcachon]]. Marie-Magdeleine worked the night shifts in the music-hall orchestras and sometimes accompanied stage presentations, affording Anouilh ample opportunity to absorb the dramatic performances from backstage. He often attended rehearsals and solicited the resident authors to let him read scripts until bedtime. He first tried his hand at playwriting here, at the age of 12, though his earliest works do not survive.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/>\n\n[[Image:lyc\u00e9e chaptal.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Lyc\u00e9e Chaptal]], at the corner of rue de Rome and the boulevard des Batignolles]]\n\nIn 1918 the family moved to Paris where the young Anouilh received his secondary education at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Chaptal]]. [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], later a major French director, was a pupil there at the same time and recalls Anouilh as an intense, rather dandified figure who hardly noticed a boy some two years younger than himself. He earned acceptance into the law school at the [[Sorbonne]] but, unable to support himself financially, he left after just 18 months to seek work as a copywriter at the advertising agency Publicit\u00e9 Damour. He liked the work, and spoke more than once with wry approval of the lessons in the classical virtues of brevity and precision of language he learned while drafting advertising copy.<ref name=\"Liukkonen\"/>\n\nAnouilh's financial troubles continued after he was called up to military service in 1929.  Supported by only his meager conscription salary, Anouilh married the actress Monelle Valentin in 1931. Though Valentin starred in many of his plays, Anouilh's daughter Caroline (from his second marriage), claims that the marriage was not a happy one. Anouilh's youngest daughter Colombe even claims that there was never an official marriage between Anouilh and Valentin. She allegedly had multiple extramarital affairs, which caused Anouilh much pain and suffering.  The infidelity weighed heavily on the dramatist as a result of the uncertainty about his own parentage. According to Caroline, Anouilh had learned that his mother had had a lover at the theatre in Arcachon who was actually his biological father. In spite of this, Anouilh and Valentin had a daughter, Catherine, in 1934 who followed the pair into theatre work at an early age. Anouilh's growing family placed further strain on his already limited finances. Determined to break into writing full-time, he began to write comic scenes for the cinema to supplement their income.<ref name=\"AnouilhCaroline\"/>\n\n===Theatre work===\nAt the age of 25, Anouilh found work as a secretary to the French actor and director [[Louis Jouvet]] at the Com\u00e9die des Champs-Elys\u00e9es. Though Anouilh's boss had happily lent him some of the set furniture left over from the production of [[Jean Giraudoux]]'s  play ''Siegfried'' to furnish his modest home, the director was not interested in encouraging his assistant's attempts at playwriting.<ref name=\"Falb\"/> Jouvet had risen to fame in the early 1930s through his collaborations with the playwright Giraudoux, and together the two worked to shift focus from the authorial voice of the director (which had dominated the French stage since the early twentieth century) back to the playwright and his text.\n\nGiraudoux was an inspiration to Anouilh and, with the encouragement of the acclaimed playwright, he began writing again in 1929. Before the end of the year he made his theatrical debut with ''Humulus le muet'', a collaborative project with [[Jean Aurenche]]. It was followed by his first solo projects, ''L'Hermine'' (''The Ermine'') in 1932 and ''Mandarine'' in 1933, both produced by [[Aur\u00e9lien Lugn\u00e9-Poe]], an innovative actor and stage manager who was then head of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'\u0152uvre]].<ref name=\"Levi\"/> Ruled by the philosophy, \"the word creates the decor,\" Lugn\u00e9-Poe let Anouilh's lyrical prose shine in front of a backdrop of simple compositions of line and color that created a unity of style and mood.<ref name=\"Brockett442\"/>\n\nThe plays were not great successes, closing after 37 and 13 performances respectively, but Anouilh persevered, following it up with a string of productions, most notably ''Y'avait un prisonnier'' (1935). These works, most in collaboration with the experimental Russian director [[Georges Pito\u00ebff]], were considered promising despite their lack of commercial profits, and the duo continued to work together until they had their first major success in 1937 with ''[[Le voyageur sans bagage]]'' (''Traveller Without Luggage''). In subsequent years, there was rarely a season in Paris that did not prominently feature a new Anouilh play and many of these were also being exported to England and America.<ref name=\"Pronko\"/> After 1938, however, much of Anouilh's later work was directed by the prominent Paris scenic designer [[Andr\u00e9 Barsacq]], who had taken over as director of the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Atelier]] after [[Charles Dullin]]'s retirement in 1940.  Barsacq was a champion for Anouilh and their affiliation was a major factor in the playwright's continued success after the war.<ref name=\"Brockett458485\"/>\n\n===Playwright===\nIn the 1940s, Anouilh turned from contemporary tales to more mythical, classic, and historic subjects.  With protagonists who asserted their independence from the fated past, themes during this period are more closely related to the existential concerns of such writers as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]]. The most famous play of this group is ''Antigone'', which \"established Anouilh as a leading dramatist, not only because of the power with which he drew the classic confrontation between the uncompromising Antigone and the politically expedient Creon, but also because French theatre-goers under the occupation read the play as a contemporary political parable.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/> His post-war plays dealt with similar concerns and included ''Rom\u00e9o et Jeannette'', ''M\u00e9d\u00e9e'' (''Medea''), and Anouilh's [[Joan of Arc]] story ''L'Alouette'' (''[[The Lark (play)|The Lark]]''), which, in its distinct optimism, rivalled the commercial success of ''Antigone''.\n\nAnouilh himself grouped his plays of this period on the basis of their dominant tone, publishing his later works in collected volumes to reflect what he felt \"represented the phases of his evolution and loosely resembled the distinction between comedy and tragedy.\"<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/> ''Pi\u00e8ces noires'' or \"Black plays\" were tragedies or realistic dramas and included ''Antigone'', ''J\u00e9zabel'', and ''La Sauvage'' (''The Restless Heart'').  This category typically featured \"young,  idealistic, and uncompromising protagonists [who] are able to maintain their integrity only by choosing death.\"<ref name=\"Brockett483\"/>  By contrast, Anouilh's ''pi\u00e8ces roses'' or \"pink plays\" were comedies where fantasy dominated with an atmosphere similar to that of fairy tales. In these plays such as ''Le Bal des voleurs'' (''Carnival of Thieves''), ''Le Rendez-vous de Senlis'' (''Dinner with the Family'') and ''[[L\u00e9ocadia]]'' (''Time Remembered''), the focus is on \"the burden of the environment and especially of the past on a protagonist seeking a happier, freer existence.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nMost of Anouilh's plays of the late 1940s and into the 1950s become darker and distinctly cruel and, in contrast with his earlier works, begin to feature middle-aged characters who must view life more practically than Anouilh's former idealistic youths. The playwright divided the works of this period into ''pi\u00e8ces brillantes'' (\"brilliant plays\") and ''pi\u00e8ces grin\u00e7antes'' (\"grating plays\"). The first group includes works such as ''L'Invitation au ch\u00e2teau'' (Ring Round the Moon) and ''Colombe'', and are typified by aristocratic settings and witty banter. The grating plays like ''[[The Waltz of the Toreadors|La Valse des tor\u00e9adors]]'' (''Waltz of the Toreadors'') and ''Le R\u00e9actionnaire amoureux'' (''The Fighting Cock'') are more bitterly funny, trading clever word play for a darker tone of disillusionment.\n\nAnother category Anouilh specifies are his ''pi\u00e8ces costum\u00e9es'' (\"costume plays\") which include ''The Lark'', ''La Foire d'Empoigne'' (''Catch as Catch Can''), and [[Becket]], an international success, depicting the historical martyr [[Thomas Becket]], the Archbishop of Canterbury who sought to defend the church against the monarch (and his friend), [[Henry II of England]], who had appointed him to his see. So classified because they share historical \"costumed\" settings, Anouilh also specifies that these plays must also prominently feature an enlightened protagonist seeking \"a moral path in a world of corruption and manipulation.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nAnouilh's final period begins with ''La Grotte'' (''The Cavern''), in which he comments on his own progress as a writer and a theatre artist. The central character is a playwright suffering from writer's block who in his frustration recalls the foibles of [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]''. Anouilh's work had always contained hints of [[metatheatre|metatheatricality]], or commentary on the business of theatre within the world of the play, but in his late works these structures became more fully developed as he begins to write primarily about character who are dramatists or theatre directors. There is also a pronounced link, during this time, of Anouilh's emphasis of theatre and the family, displaying intimate relationships that are \"more profound and more important than the traditional heightened action of 'theatre'&thinsp;\".{{whose quote|dated=October 2016}} Antoine, the playwright-protagonist of ''Cher Antoine; ou, L'Amour rat\u00e9'' (''Dear Antoine; or, The Love That Failed''), asserts that the world must take notice of these ''pi\u00e8ces secr\u00e8tes'' (secret dramas) and Anouilh scholars have proposed this name, ''pi\u00e8ces secr\u00e8tes'', to classify the collected works of his latest period.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>{{clarify|date=October 2016}}<!--one double-quotation mark missing; quotation uncertain.-->\n\n===Political controversy===\nAnouilh remained staunchly apolitical for most of his life and career. He served in the military during at least two periods, having been drafted into the French Army in 1931 and 1939. He was a prisoner of war for a short time when the Germans conquered France and willingly lived and worked in Paris during the subsequent [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]]. Because he refused to take sides during France's collaboration with the [[Axis Alliance]] some critics have branded him as a potential Nazi sympathiser.  This controversy escalated as a result of Anouilh's public clashes with leader of the [[Free French Forces]] (and later President of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]), [[Charles de Gaulle|General Charles de Gaulle]].  In the mid-1940s Anouilh and several other intellectuals signed a petition for clemency to save the writer [[Robert Brasillach]], who was condemned to death for being a Nazi collaborator. Brasillach was executed by firing squad in February 1945, despite the outcry from Anouilh and his peers that the new government had no right to persecute individuals for \"intellectual crimes\" in the absence of military or political action.<ref name=\"Kaplan\"/> Nevertheless, Anouilh refused to comment on his political views, writing in a letter to the Belgian critic Hubert Gignoux in 1946, \"I do not have a biography and I am very happy about it. The rest of my life, as long as God wills it, will remain my personal business, and I will withhold the details of it.\"<ref name=\"Ginestier\"/>\nAnouilh's plays provide the most important clues about his political point of view, though their reputation for ambiguity further complicates the matter. For instance ''Antigone'', provides an [[allegory|allegorical]] representation of the debate between the idealistic members of the [[French Resistance]] and the pragmatism of the collaborationists. Though many have read the play as having a strong anti-Nazi sentiment, the fact that the Vichy Regime allowed the piece to be performed without censure testifies to the fact that it was potentially seen as supportive of the occupation in its time.<ref name=\"Wiles\"/><ref name=\"Krauss\"/>  Though the playwright romanticizes Antigone's sense of honor and duty to what is morally right, in this case resisting the Nazi forces, it can also be said that Anouilh, like Sophocles before him, makes a convincing argument for Creon's method of leadership.<ref name=\"Smith2426\"/>\n\n===Awards and recognition===\nIn 1970 his work was recognized with the ''[[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]]''. In 2012, the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years and it was revealed that Anouilh was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], along with John Steinbeck (winner), [[Robert Graves]], [[Lawrence Durrell]] and [[Karen Blixen]].<ref name=floodjan2013>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/03/swedish-academy-controversy-steinbeck-nobel |title=Swedish Academy reopens controversy surrounding Steinbeck's Nobel prize |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Alison Flood |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=January 3, 2013}}</ref> According to a report in ''The Guardian'', \"It is not clear why Anouilh was passed over, but the French poet [[Saint-John Perse]] had taken the Nobel in 1960, meaning that France was well represented on the roster of winners, and ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' reveals that [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], who won the prize in 1964, was starting to be seriously considered as a candidate.\"<ref name=floodjan2013/>\n\nIn 1980, he was the first recipient of the [[Grand prix du th\u00e9\u00e2tre (Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise)|Grand Prix du Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] established that year.\n\n==Critical discussion==\nBy the end of his career, Anouilh's reputation outstripped all his contemporaries. However, his repertoire remained unusually confined to theatre and film. Most French dramatists of the 1930s and 1940s, including Anouilh's most significant contemporary influence, Giraudoux, not only wrote for the stage but also composed poetry, novels, or essays.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/> Nevertheless, he remained prolific, consistently producing and publishing performance works for more than fifty years.\n\nAnouilh's early works were \"naturalistic studies of a sordid and corrupt world.\"<ref name=\"Liukkonen\"/> Many of these plays present the reader with the striking and inescapable dichotomy between pragmatism and a sort of transcendent idealism.  There is little to no \"middle ground of ambiguity\" that exists where this conflict asserts itself.<ref name=\"Pucciani\"/> This is evidenced in ''Le Voyageur Sans Bagage.'' The main character Gaston, a World War I veteran who suffers from amnesia, cannot remember the moral depravity of his youth (he slept with his brother's wife and severely injured his best friend). This checkered past is invariably at odds with the near-angelic behavior that he now exhibits, and recognition of this truth forces him to leave his former identity behind, unable to reconcile the two sides of himself. In denouncing his past, Gaston reclasses his freedom as an illusion, but one of his own making. He befriends a young English boy and shows him his identifying scar; this gesture allows the boy to describe Gaston to the authorities, thereby claiming him as kin. With a new life and a new family, Gaston has a fresh start.<ref name=\"Rocchi\"/>  David I. Grossvogel, describes this situation as the \"restoration of a childhood paradise lost,\" attributing ''Le Voyageur Sans Bagage'' as the beginning of Anouilh's search to justify the unhappiness of his youth.<ref name=\"Grossvogel\"/> Theatre historian Marvin Carlson agrees, noting that this play epitomizes the \"complex tonality and deft dramatic technique\" that remained throughout his work, though, he asserts, it was only as the playwright matured that his \"dark view of the human condition [reached] its final expression.\"<ref name=\"Carlson\"/>\n\nAnouilh disagreed with these somber readings of his best works, however, arguing that, like all great French literature, his plays had found ways to laugh at misfortune. \"Thanks to Moli\u00e8re,\" Anouilh said, \"the true French theatre is the only one that is not gloomy, in which we laugh like men at war with our misery and our horror. This humor is one of France's messages to the world.\"<ref name=\"Hotchman\"/>\n\nDisclosing his thoughts on French theatre and his personal perspective as a playwright, he said that the perception of his work was often misguided:\n\n{{quote|I am played in private theaters, so I write for the bourgeoisie.  One has to rely on the people who pay for their places; the people who support the theater are bourgeois.  But this public has changed:  They have such a terror of not being in touch, of missing out on a fashionable event that they no longer exist as a decisive force.  I think the public has lost its head.  They now say that a play can't be that good if they can understand it.  My plays are not hermetic enough.  It's rather Moli\u00e8resque, don't you think?|author=Jean Anouilh<ref name=\"Porter\"/>}}\n\nIn the 1950s, Anouilh examined his antagonism with General de Gaulle in ''L'Hurluberlu, ou Le Reactionnaire amoureux'' (1958) and ''Le Songe du critique'' (1960). He began to lose the favor of audiences and critics alike, however, with the emergence of such playwrights as [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]] and [[Samuel Beckett]]. Though he shared with these authors a \"similar desperate vision of human existence,\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Liukkonen|first=Petri and Ari Pesonen|title=Jean Anouilh (1910-1987)}}</ref> these new absurdist theatres' pursuit of alternative dramaturgies made Anouilh's semi-realistic plays seem dull and old-fashioned. In the 1980s Anouilh reinvented himself as a director, staging his own plays as well as those of other authors. He died of a heart attack in Lausanne, Switzerland on 3 October 1987. By then divorced from Monelle Valentin, he was survived by his second wife, Nicole Lan\u00e7on, and four children.\n\n==Works==\n===Original theatre productions: Paris===\n* ''L'Hermine''.

{"title_page": "T helper cell", "text_new": "{{About|a type of T cell|the professional wrestling tag team|Ang\u00e9lico and Jack Evans}}\n{{short description|Type of T cell that regulates immune responses}}\nThe '''T helper cells''' ('''T<sub>h</sub> cells'''), also known as '''CD4<sup>+</sup> cells''', are a type of [[T cell]] that play an important role in the [[immune system]], particularly in the [[adaptive immune system]]. They help the activity of other immune cells by releasing T cell [[cytokines]]. These cells help suppress or regulate immune responses. They are essential in [[B cell]] [[Immunoglobulin class switching|antibody class switching]], in the activation and growth of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s, and in maximizing [[bactericidal]] activity of [[phagocytes]] such as [[macrophages]].\n\nMature T<sub>h</sub> cells express the surface protein [[CD4]] and are referred to as '''CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells'''. Such CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are generally treated as having a pre-defined role as helper T cells within the [[immune system]]. For example, when an [[antigen-presenting cell]] expresses an antigen on [[MHC class II]], a CD4<sup>+</sup> cell will aid those cells through a combination of cell to cell interactions (e.g. [[CD40 (protein)]] and [[CD154|CD40L]]) and through [[cytokines]].\n\n'''[[CD154]]''', also called '''CD40 ligand''' or '''CD40L''', is a cell surface [[protein]] that mediates T cell helper function in a contact-dependent process<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lederman S, Yellin MJ, Krichevsky A, Belko J, Lee JJ, Chess L | title = Identification of a novel surface protein on activated CD4+ T cells that induces contact-dependent B cell differentiation (help) | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 175 | issue = 4 | pages = 1091\u2013101 | date = April 1992 | pmid = 1348081 | pmc = 2119166 | doi = 10.1084/jem.175.4.1091 }}</ref> and is a member of the [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]] superfamily of molecules.

In the advanced stages of HIV infection, loss of functional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells leads to the symptomatic stage of infection known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]). When HIV is detected early in blood or other bodily fluids, proper adherence to antiretroviral therapy will prevent the progression of HIV into AIDS and allow the body to naturally restore its own CD4 cell count. There are other rare disorders such as [[lymphocytopenia]] which result in the absence or dysfunction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. These disorders produce similar symptoms, many of which are fatal.\n\n== Activation of naive helper T cells ==\nFollowing [[T cell#T cell development|T cell development]] in the [[thymus]], these cells (termed recent thymic emigrants (RTE)) egress from the thymus and home to secondary lymphoid organs (SLO; [[spleen]] and [[lymph nodes]]). Maturation of RTE in SLO results in the generation of mature [[naive T cell]]s (Na\u00efve T cells are those T cells that have never been exposed to the [[antigen]] that they are programmed to respond to), but naive T cells now lack or lowered the expression of the RTE-related surface markers, such as [[CD31]], [[PTK7]], Complement Receptor 1 and 2 ([[Complement receptor 1|CR1]], [[Complement receptor 2|CR2]]) and the production of [[Interleukin 8|interleukin 8 (IL-8)]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Broek T, Borghans JA, van Wijk F | title = The full spectrum of human naive T cells | journal = Nature Reviews.

The T cell receptor (TCR) consists of both constant and variable regions. The variable region determines what antigen the T cell can respond to. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have TCRs with an affinity for [[Class II MHC]], and CD4 is involved in determining MHC affinity during maturation in the [[thymus]]. Class II MHC proteins are generally only found on the surface of specialised [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs). Specialised antigen-presenting cells are primarily [[dendritic cells]], [[macrophages]] and [[B cells]], although dendritic cells are the only cell group that expresses MHC Class II constitutively (at all times). Some APCs also bind native (or unprocessed) antigens to their surface, such as [[follicular dendritic cells]], but unprocessed antigens do not interact with T cells and are not involved in their activation. The antigens that bind to MHC proteins are always short [[peptides]], 8-10 amino acids long for MHC Class I, and up to 25 or so for MHC Class II.\n\n=== Recognition (signal 1) ===\n\n[[File:Antigen presentation.svg|thumb|300px|Antigen presentation stimulates na\u00efve CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to respectively become mature [[Cytotoxic T cell|\"cytotoxic\" CD8+ cells]] and \"helper\" CD4+ cells.]]\n\nDuring an immune response, [[Antigen-presenting cell#Professional APCs|professional antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs) [[Endocytosis|endocytose]] foreign material (typically [[bacteria]] or [[virus]]es), which undergoes [[antigen processing|processing]], then travel from the infection site to the [[lymph node]]s. Once at the lymph nodes, the APCs begin to present antigen peptides that are bound to Class II MHC, allowing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that express the specific TCRs against the peptide/MHC complex to activate.\n\nWhen a T<sub>h</sub> cell encounters and recognises the antigen on an APC, the [[T cell receptor|TCR]]-[[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] complex binds strongly to the peptide-MHC complex present on the surface of professional APCs. [[CD4]], a co-receptor of the TCR complex, also binds to a different section of the MHC molecule. These interactions bring these proteins closer together, allowing the [[intracellular]] [[kinase]]s present on the TCR, CD3 and CD4 proteins to activate each other via [[phosphorylation]]. With the assistance of a phosphatase present on the intracellular section of [[CD45]] (common leukocyte antigen), these molecules activate major T<sub>h</sub> cell intracellular pathways. These active pathways are known as Signal 1 of T cell activation, as it is the first and primary pro-activation signal in a T<sub>h</sub> cell. Upon subsequent encounters with a given antigen, [[memory T cells]] are re-activated using the same TCR pathways.\n\nThe binding of the antigen-MHC to the TCR complex and CD4 may also help the APC and the T<sub>h</sub> cell adhere during T<sub>h</sub> cell activation, but the integrin protein [[LFA-1]] on the T cell and [[Intercellular adhesion molecule|ICAM]] on the APC are the primary molecules of adhesion in this cell interaction.\n\nIt is unknown what role the relatively bulky extracellular region of CD45 plays during cell interactions, but CD45 has various isoforms that change in size depending on the T<sub>h</sub> cell's activation and maturation status. For example, CD45 shortens in length following T<sub>h</sub> activation (CD45RA<sup>+</sup> to CD45RO<sup>+</sup>), but whether this change in length influences activation is unknown. It has been proposed that the larger CD45RA+ may decrease the accessibility of the T cell receptor for the antigen-MHC molecule, thereby necessitating an increase in the affinity (and specificity) of the T cell for activation. However, once the activation has occurred, CD45 shortens, allowing easier interactions and activation as an effector T helper cell.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n===Verification (signal 2)===\nHaving received the first TCR/CD3 signal, the na\u00efve T cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as Signal 2. This verification step is a protective measure to ensure that a T cell is responding to a foreign antigen. If this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the T cell presumes that it is auto-reactive. This results in the cell becoming [[anergy|anergic]] (anergy is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of Signal 1). Anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. These cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo [[apoptosis]].\n\nThe second signal involves an interaction between [[CD28]] on the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and the proteins [[CD80]] (B7.1) or [[CD86]] (B7.2) on the professional APCs. Both CD80 and CD86 activate the CD28 receptor. These proteins are also known as [[Co-stimulation|co-stimulatory molecules]].\n\nAlthough the verification stage is necessary for the activation of na\u00efve helper T cells, the importance of this stage is best demonstrated during the similar activation mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. As na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have no true bias towards foreign sources, these T cells must rely on the activation of CD28 for confirmation that they recognise a foreign antigen (as CD80/CD86 is only expressed by active APC's). CD28 plays an important role in decreasing the risk of T cell auto-immunity against host antigens.\n\nOnce the na\u00efve T cell has both pathways activated, the biochemical changes induced by Signal 1 are altered, allowing the cell to activate instead of anergise{{typo help inline|reason=similar to anergies|date=November 2019}}. The second signal is then obsolete; only the first signal is necessary for future activation. This is also true for memory T cells, which is one example of [[Adaptive immune system|learned immunity]]. Faster responses occur upon reinfection because memory T cells have already undergone confirmation and can produce effector cells much sooner.\n\n=== Proliferation ===\nOnce the two-signal activation is complete the T helper cell (T<sub>h</sub>) then allows itself to [[Cell growth|proliferate]]. It achieves this by releasing a potent T cell growth factor called [[interleukin 2]] (IL-2) which acts upon itself in an [[autocrine]] fashion. Activated T cells also produce the alpha sub-unit of the [[IL-2 receptor]] ([[CD25]] or IL-2R), enabling a fully functional receptor that can bind with IL-2, which in turn activates the T cell's proliferation pathways.\n\nThe [[autocrine]] or [[paracrine]] secretion of IL-2 can bind to that same T<sub>h</sub> cell or neighboring T<sub>h</sub>'s via the IL-2R thus driving proliferation and clonal expansion. The T<sub>h</sub> cells receiving both signals of activation and proliferation will then become T<sub>h</sub>0 cells (T helper 0) cell that secrete IL-2, [[interleukin 4|IL-4]] and [[interferon gamma]] (IFN-\u03b3). The T<sub>h</sub>0 cells will then differentiate into T<sub>h</sub>1 or T<sub>h</sub>2 cells depending on [[cytokine]] environment. IFN-\u03b3 drives T<sub>h</sub>1 cell production while [[interleukin 10|IL-10]] and IL-4 inhibit T<sub>h</sub>1 cell production. Conversely, IL-4 drives T<sub>h</sub>2 cell production and IFN-\u03b3 inhibits T<sub>h</sub>2 cells. These cytokines are [[pleiotropic]] and carry out many other functions of the immune response.\n\n== Effector function ==\n\nIn 1991, three groups reported discovering CD154, which is the molecular basis of T cell helper function.

In order to be effective, helper T cells must determine which cytokines will allow the immune system to be most useful or beneficial for the host. Understanding exactly how helper T cells respond to immune challenges is currently of major interest in [[immunology]], because such knowledge may be very useful in the treatment of [[disease]] and in increasing the effectiveness of [[vaccination]].\n\n=== T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model ===\nProliferating helper T cells that develop into effector T cells differentiate into two major subtypes of cells known as T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 cells (also known as Type 1 and Type 2 helper T cells, respectively).\n\nT<sub>h</sub>1 helper cells lead to an increased cell-mediated response, typically against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. They are triggered by the polarising cytokine IL-12 and their effector cytokines are IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2. The main effector cells of T<sub>h</sub>1 immunity are macrophages as well as CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IFN-\u03b3 CD4 T cells. The key T<sub>h</sub>1 transcription factors are STAT4 and T-bet. IFN-\u03b3 secreted by CD4 T cells can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 can activate iNOS to produce NOx free radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa. T<sub>h</sub>1 overactivation against autoantigens will cause Type 4 delayed-type hypersensitivity.

IFN-gamma also inhibits the production of cytokines such as [[interleukin-4]], an important cytokine associated with the Type 2 response, and thus it also acts to preserve its own response.\n | The Type 2 response promotes its own profile using two different cytokines. [[Interleukin-4]] acts on helper T cells to promote the production of T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines (including itself; it is auto-regulatory), while [[interleukin-10]] (IL-10) inhibits a variety of cytokines including [[interleukin-2]] and [[interferon-gamma|IFN-\u03b3]] in helper T cells and IL-12 in dendritic cells and macrophages. The combined action of these two cytokines suggests that once the T cell has decided to produce these cytokines, that decision is preserved (and also encourages other T cells to do the same).\n|}\n\nWhile we know about the types of cytokine patterns helper T cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided. Various evidence suggests that the type of APC presenting the antigen to the T cell has a major influence on its profile. Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, but our understanding is nowhere near complete.\n\n===T<sub>h</sub>17 helper cells===\n{{Main|T helper 17 cell}}\n[[T helper 17 cell|T<sub>h</sub>17 helper cells]] are a subset of [[T helper cells]] developmentally distinct from T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 lineages producing [[interleukin 17]] (IL-17).\nT<sub>h</sub> cells produce IL-17 which is a pro inflammatory substance. This means it is especially good at fighting extracellular pathogens and fungi.\n\n===TH\u03b1\u03b2 helper cells===\nTH\u03b1\u03b2 helper cells provide the host immunity against viruses. Their differentiation is triggered by IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 or [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]]. Their key effector cytokine is IL-10. Their main effector cells are [[natural killer cell|NK cells]] as well as CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IL-10 CD4 T cells. The key TH\u03b1\u03b2 transcription factors are STAT1 and STAT3 as well as IRFs. IL-10 from CD4 T cells activate NK cells' [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity|ADCC]] to apoptose virus-infected cells and to induce host as well as viral DNA fragmentation. IFN alpha/beta can suppress transcription to avoid virus replication and transmission. Overactivation of TH\u03b1\u03b2 against autoantigen will cause type 2 antibody-dependent cytotoxic hypersensitivity. [[Myasthenia gravis]] or [[Graves' disease]] belong to this category.<ref name=\"Wanchung Hu2007\">{{Cite thesis\n|degree=Ph.D.\n|first=Wanchung\n|last=Hu\n|title=Microarray analysis of PBMC gene expression profiles after Plasmodium falciparum malarial infection\n|publisher=Johns Hopkins University\n|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Limitations to the T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model ===\nThe interactions between cytokines from the T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model can be more complicated in some animals. For example, the T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokine [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]] inhibits cytokine production of both T<sub>h</sub> subsets in humans. Human IL-10 (hIL-10) suppresses the proliferation and cytokine production of all T cells and the activity of macrophages, but continues to stimulate [[plasma cells]], ensuring that antibody production still occurs. As such, hIL-10 is not believed to truly promote the T<sub>h</sub>2 response in humans, but acts to prevent over-stimulation of helper T cells while still maximising the production of [[antibody|antibodies]].\n\nThere are also other types of T cells that can influence the expression and activation of helper T cells, such as natural [[regulatory T cells]], along with less common cytokine profiles such as the [[T helper 3 cell|T<sub>h</sub>3]] subset of helper T cells. Terms such as \"regulatory\" and \"suppression\" have become ambiguous after the discovery that helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are also capable of regulating (and suppressing) their own responses outside of dedicated regulatory T cells.\n\nOne major difference between regulatory T cells and effector T cells is that regulatory T cells typically serve to modulate and deactivate the immune response, while effector T cell groups usually begin with immune-promoting cytokines and then switch to inhibitory cytokines later in their life cycle. The latter is a feature of T<sub>h</sub>3 cells, which transform into a regulatory subset after its initial activation and cytokine production.\n\nBoth [[regulatory T cells]] and T<sub>h</sub>3 cells produce the cytokine [[TGF \u03b2|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-\u03b2) and IL-10. Both cytokines are inhibitory to helper T cells; TGF-\u03b2 suppresses the activity of most of the immune system. There is evidence to suggest that TGF-\u03b2 may not suppress activated Th2 cells as effectively as it might suppress naive cells, but it is not typically considered a Th2 cytokine.\n\nThe characterisation of another novel T helper subtype, [[T helper 17 cell]]s (T<sub>h</sub>17)<ref name=\"Harrington2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Harrington LE, Hatton RD, Mangan PR, Turner H, Murphy TL, Murphy KM, Weaver CT | title = Interleukin 17-producing CD4+ effector T cells develop via a lineage distinct from the T helper type 1 and 2 lineages | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 1123\u201332 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16200070 | doi = 10.1038/ni1254 }}</ref> has cast further doubt on the basic T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model.

By this mechanism they provide the immune system with \"memory\" against previously encountered pathogens.\n\n== Role in disease ==\nConsidering the diverse and important role helper T cells play in the immune system, it is not surprising that these cells often influence the immune response against disease. They also appear to make occasional mistakes, or generate responses that would be politely considered non-beneficial. In the worst-case scenario, the helper T cell response could lead to a disaster and the fatality of the host. Fortunately this is a very rare occurrence.\n\n=== Antitumor immunity ===\n{{Main|CD4+ T cells and antitumor immunity}}\n\n=== Hypersensitivity ===\nThe immune system must achieve a balance of sensitivity in order to respond to foreign antigens without responding to the antigens of the host itself. When the immune system responds to very low levels of antigen that it usually shouldn't respond to, a [[hypersensitivity]] response occurs. Hypersensitivity is believed to be the cause of [[allergy]] and some [[auto-immune disease]].\n\nHypersensitivity reactions can be divided into four types:\n* [[Type 1 hypersensitivity]] includes common immune disorders such as [[asthma]], [[allergic rhinitis]] (hay fever), [[eczema]], [[urticaria]] (hives) and [[anaphylaxis]]. These reactions all involve [[IgE]] [[antibody|antibodies]], which require a T<sub>h</sub>2 response during helper T cell development. Preventive treatments, such as [[corticosteroids]] and [[montelukast]], focus on suppressing mast cells or other allergic cells; T cells do not play a primary role during the actual inflammatory response. It's important to note that the numeral allocation of hypersensitivity \"types\" does not correlate (and is completely unrelated) to the \"response\" in the T<sub>h</sub> model.\n* [[Type II hypersensitivity|Type 2]] and [[Type 3 hypersensitivity]] both involve complications from auto-immune or low affinity antibodies. In both of these reactions, T cells may play an accomplice role in generating these auto-specific antibodies, although some of these reactions under Type 2 hypersensitivity would be considered normal in a healthy immune system (for example, [[Rhesus factor#Hemolytic disease of the newborn|Rhesus factor reactions]] during child-birth is a normal immune response against child antigens). The understanding of the role of helper T cells in these responses is limited but it is generally thought that T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines would promote such disorders. For example, studies have suggested that [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]] (SLE) and other auto-immune diseases of similar nature can be linked to the production of T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines.\n* [[Type 4 hypersensitivity]], also known as [[Hypersensitivity#Coombs and Gell classification|delayed type hypersensitivity]], are caused via the over-stimulation of immune cells, commonly [[lymphocytes]] and [[macrophages]], resulting in chronic [[inflammation]] and cytokine release. Antibodies do not play a direct role in this allergy type. T cells play an important role in this hypersensitivity, as they activate against the stimulus itself and promote the activation of other cells; particularly macrophages via T<sub>h</sub>1 cytokines.\n\nOther cellular hypersensitivities include [[cytotoxic T cell]] mediated [[auto-immune disease]], and a similar phenomenon; [[transplant rejection]]. Helper T cells are required to fuel the development of these diseases. In order to create sufficient [[Autoimmunity|auto-reactive]] killer T cells, [[interleukin-2]] must be produced, and this is supplied by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can also stimulate cells such as [[natural killer cell]]s and macrophages via cytokines such as [[interferon-gamma]], encouraging these cytotoxic cells to kill host cells in certain circumstances.\n\nThe mechanism that killer T cells use during auto-immunity is almost identical to their response against [[viruses]], and some viruses have been accused of causing auto-immune diseases such as [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes mellitus]]. Cellular auto-immune disease occurs because the host antigen recognition systems fail, and the [[immune system]] believes, by mistake, that a host antigen is foreign. As a result, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells treat the host cell presenting that antigen as infected, and go on to destroy all host cells (or in the case of transplant rejection, transplant organ) that express that antigen.\n\nSome of this section is a simplification. Many auto-immune diseases are more complex. A well-known example is [[rheumatoid arthritis]], where both antibodies and immune cells are known to play a role in the pathology. Generally the immunology of most auto-immune diseases is not well understood.\n\n=== HIV infection ===\nPerhaps the best example of the importance of [[CD4|CD4<sup>+</sup>]] T cells is demonstrated with [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) infection. HIV mainly targets lymphoid CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but can infect other cells that express CD4 such as [[macrophages]] and [[dendritic cells]] (both groups express CD4 at low levels).\n\nIt has been proposed that during the non-symptomatic phase of HIV infection, the virus has a relatively low affinity towards T cells (and has a higher affinity for macrophages), resulting in a slow kill rate of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by the immune system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This is initially compensated for via the production of new helper T cells from the [[thymus]] (originally from the [[bone marrow]]). Once the virus becomes [[HIV#Tropism|lymphotropic]] (or T-tropic) however, it begins to infect CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells far more efficiently (likely due to a change in the [[co-receptor]]s it binds to during infection), and the immune system is overwhelmed. Of note, recent studies suggest that only ~5% of the lymphoid-derived CD4 T cells targeted by HIV are permissive and become productively infected with the virus. More than 95% of the CD4 T cells that die are resting and are unable to support productive infection. These cells undergo abortive infection with HIV.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Doitsh G. | year = 2010 | title = Abortive HIV Infection Mediates CD4 T Cell Depletion and Inflammation in Human Lymphoid Tissue | url = http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(10)01245-6 | journal = Cell | volume =  143| issue = 5| pages = 789\u2013801 | pmid = 21111238 | pmc = 3026834 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.001 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Cell death is triggered when the host cell detects HIV foreign DNA intermediates and initiates a suicidal death pathway in an attempt to protect the host, leading to [[caspase-1]] activation in [[inflammasome]]s, thus causing [[pyroptosis]] (a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death).<ref name=\"Doitsh_2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Doitsh G, Galloway NL, Geng X, Yang Z, Monroe KM, Zepeda O, Hunt PW, Hatano H, Sowinski S, Mu\u00f1oz-Arias I, Greene WC | title = Cell death by pyroptosis drives CD4 T-cell depletion in HIV-1 infection | journal = Nature | volume = 505 | issue = 7484 | pages = 509\u201314 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24356306 | pmc = 4047036 | doi = 10.1038/nature12940 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Monroe KM | year = 2013 | title = IFI16 DNA Sensor Is Required for Death of Lymphoid CD4 T Cells Abortively Infected with HIV | url = | journal = Science | volume =  343| issue = 6169| pages =  428\u201332| doi = 10.1126/science.1243640 | pmid = 24356113 | pmc=3976200|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nAt this point chronic inflammation ensues, and functional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell levels begin to decrease, eventually to a point where the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population is too small to recognize the full range of [[antigen]]s that could potentially be detected.

This decline in killing of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells results in the virus being produced for a longer period (the infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are not killed as quickly), increasing the proliferation of the virus, and accelerating the development of the disease.\n# [[Antibody class switching]] declines significantly once helper T cell function fails. The immune system loses its ability to improve the affinity of their antibodies, and are unable to generate B cells that can produce antibody groups such as [[IgG]] and [[IgA]]. These effects are primarily due to the loss of any helper T cell that can interact with the B lymphocyte correctly. Another symptom of AIDS is the reduction in antibody levels due to a decrease in T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines (and less interactions by helper T cells). All of these complications result in an increased susceptibility to aggressive bacterial infections, especially in areas of the body not accessible by [[IgM]] antibodies.\n\nIf the patient does not respond to (or does not receive) [[Management of HIV/AIDS|HIV treatment]] they will succumb usually to either cancers or infections; the immune system finally reaches a point where it is no longer coordinated or stimulated enough to deal with the disease.\n\nInhibition of CD4 T-cell expansion during HIV infection may occur due to microbial translocation in an IL-10-dependent way.

For example, when an [[antigen-presenting cell]] expresses an antigen on [[MHC class II]], a CD4<sup>+</sup> cell will aid those cells through a combination of cell to cell interactions (e.g. [[CD40 (protein)]] and [[CD154|CD40L]]) and through [[cytokines]].\n\n'''[[CD154]]''', also called '''CD40 ligand''' or '''CD40L''', is a cell surface [[protein]] that mediates T cell helper function in a contact-dependent process<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lederman S, Yellin MJ, Krichevsky A, Belko J, Lee JJ, Chess L | title = Identification of a novel surface protein on activated CD4+ T cells that induces contact-dependent B cell differentiation (help) | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 175 | issue = 4 | pages = 1091\u2013101 | date = April 1992 | pmid = 1348081 | pmc = 2119166 | doi = 10.1084/jem.175.4.1091 }}</ref> and is a member of the [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]] superfamily of molecules.

In the advanced stages of HIV infection, loss of functional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells leads to the symptomatic stage of infection known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]). When HIV is detected early in blood or other bodily fluids, proper adherence to antiretroviral therapy will prevent the progression of HIV into AIDS and allow the body to naturally restore it's own CD4 cell count. There are other rare disorders such as [[lymphocytopenia]] which result in the absence or dysfunction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. These disorders produce similar symptoms, many of which are fatal.\n\n== Activation of naive helper T cells ==\nFollowing [[T cell#T cell development|T cell development]] in the [[thymus]], these cells (termed recent thymic emigrants (RTE)) egress from the thymus and home to secondary lymphoid organs (SLO; [[spleen]] and [[lymph nodes]]). Maturation of RTE in SLO results in the generation of mature [[Naive T cell|naive T cells]] (Na\u00efve T cells are those T cells that have never been exposed to the [[antigen]] that they are programmed to respond to), but naive T cells now lack or lowered the expression of the RTE-related surface markers, such as [[CD31]], [[PTK7]], Complement Receptor 1 and 2 ([[Complement receptor 1|CR1]], [[Complement receptor 2|CR2]]) and the production of [[Interleukin 8|interleukin 8 (IL-8)]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = van den Broek T, Borghans JA, van Wijk F | title = The full spectrum of human naive T cells | journal = Nature Reviews.

The T cell receptor (TCR) consists of both constant and variable regions. The variable region determines what antigen the T cell can respond to. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have TCRs with an affinity for [[Class II MHC]], and CD4 is involved in determining MHC affinity during maturation in the [[thymus]]. Class II MHC proteins are generally only found on the surface of specialised [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs). Specialised antigen-presenting cells are primarily [[dendritic cells]], [[macrophages]] and [[B cells]], although dendritic cells are the only cell group that expresses MHC Class II constitutively (at all times). Some APCs also bind native (or unprocessed) antigens to their surface, such as [[follicular dendritic cells]], but unprocessed antigens do not interact with T cells and are not involved in their activation. The antigens that bind to MHC proteins are always short [[peptides]], 8-10 amino acids long for MHC Class I, and up to 25 or so for MHC Class II.\n\n=== Recognition (signal 1) ===\n\n[[File:Antigen presentation.svg|thumb|300px|Antigen presentation stimulates na\u00efve CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to respectively become mature [[Cytotoxic T cell|\"cytotoxic\" CD8+ cells]] and \"helper\" CD4+ cells.]]\n\nDuring an immune response, [[Antigen-presenting cell#Professional APCs|professional antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs) [[Endocytosis|endocytose]] foreign material (typically [[bacteria]] or [[virus]]es), which undergoes [[antigen processing|processing]], then travel from the infection site to the [[lymph node]]s. Once at the lymph nodes, the APCs begin to present antigen peptides that are bound to Class II MHC, allowing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that express the specific TCRs against the peptide/MHC complex to activate.\n\nWhen a T<sub>h</sub> cell encounters and recognises the antigen on an APC, the [[T cell receptor|TCR]]-[[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] complex binds strongly to the peptide-MHC complex present on the surface of professional APCs. [[CD4]], a co-receptor of the TCR complex, also binds to a different section of the MHC molecule. These interactions bring these proteins closer together, allowing the [[intracellular]] [[kinase]]s present on the TCR, CD3 and CD4 proteins to activate each other via [[phosphorylation]]. With the assistance of a phosphatase present on the intracellular section of [[CD45]] (common leukocyte antigen), these molecules activate major T<sub>h</sub> cell intracellular pathways. These active pathways are known as Signal 1 of T cell activation, as it is the first and primary pro-activation signal in a T<sub>h</sub> cell. Upon subsequent encounters with a given antigen, [[memory T cells]] are re-activated using the same TCR pathways.\n\nThe binding of the antigen-MHC to the TCR complex and CD4 may also help the APC and the T<sub>h</sub> cell adhere during T<sub>h</sub> cell activation, but the integrin protein [[LFA-1]] on the T cell and [[Intercellular adhesion molecule|ICAM]] on the APC are the primary molecules of adhesion in this cell interaction.\n\nIt is unknown what role the relatively bulky extracellular region of CD45 plays during cell interactions, but CD45 has various isoforms that change in size depending on the T<sub>h</sub> cell's activation and maturation status. For example, CD45 shortens in length following T<sub>h</sub> activation (CD45RA<sup>+</sup> to CD45RO<sup>+</sup>), but whether this change in length influences activation is unknown. It has been proposed that the larger CD45RA+ may decrease the accessibility of the T cell receptor for the antigen-MHC molecule, thereby necessitating an increase in the affinity (and specificity) of the T cell for activation. However, once the activation has occurred, CD45 shortens, allowing easier interactions and activation as an effector T helper cell.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n===Verification (signal 2)===\nHaving received the first TCR/CD3 signal, the na\u00efve T cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as Signal 2. This verification step is a protective measure to ensure that a T cell is responding to a foreign antigen. If this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the T cell presumes that it is auto-reactive. This results in the cell becoming [[anergy|anergic]] (anergy is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of Signal 1). Anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. These cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo [[apoptosis]].\n\nThe second signal involves an interaction between [[CD28]] on the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and the proteins [[CD80]] (B7.1) or [[CD86]] (B7.2) on the professional APCs. Both CD80 and CD86 activate the CD28 receptor. These proteins are also known as [[Co-stimulation|co-stimulatory molecules]].\n\nAlthough the verification stage is necessary for the activation of na\u00efve helper T cells, the importance of this stage is best demonstrated during the similar activation mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. As na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have no true bias towards foreign sources, these T cells must rely on the activation of CD28 for confirmation that they recognise a foreign antigen (as CD80/CD86 is only expressed by active APC's). CD28 plays an important role in decreasing the risk of T cell auto-immunity against host antigens.\n\nOnce the na\u00efve T cell has both pathways activated, the biochemical changes induced by Signal 1 are altered, allowing the cell to activate instead of anergise{{typo help inline|reason=similar to anergies|date=November 2019}}. The second signal is then obsolete; only the first signal is necessary for future activation. This is also true for memory T cells, which is one example of [[Adaptive immune system|learned immunity]]. Faster responses occur upon reinfection because memory T cells have already undergone confirmation and can produce effector cells much sooner.\n\n=== Proliferation ===\nOnce the two-signal activation is complete the T helper cell (T<sub>h</sub>) then allows itself to [[Cell growth|proliferate]]. It achieves this by releasing a potent T cell growth factor called [[interleukin 2]] (IL-2) which acts upon itself in an [[autocrine]] fashion. Activated T cells also produce the alpha sub-unit of the [[IL-2 receptor]] ([[CD25]] or IL-2R), enabling a fully functional receptor that can bind with IL-2, which in turn activates the T cell's proliferation pathways.\n\nThe [[autocrine]] or [[paracrine]] secretion of IL-2 can bind to that same T<sub>h</sub> cell or neighboring T<sub>h</sub>'s via the IL-2R thus driving proliferation and clonal expansion. The T<sub>h</sub> cells receiving both signals of activation and proliferation will then become T<sub>h</sub>0 cells (T helper 0) cell that secrete IL-2, [[interleukin 4|IL-4]] and [[interferon gamma]] (IFN-\u03b3). The T<sub>h</sub>0 cells will then differentiate into T<sub>h</sub>1 or T<sub>h</sub>2 cells depending on [[cytokine]] environment. IFN-\u03b3 drives T<sub>h</sub>1 cell production while [[interleukin 10|IL-10]] and IL-4 inhibit T<sub>h</sub>1 cell production. Conversely, IL-4 drives T<sub>h</sub>2 cell production and IFN-\u03b3 inhibits T<sub>h</sub>2 cells. These cytokines are [[pleiotropic]] and carry out many other functions of the immune response.\n\n== Effector function ==\n\nIn 1991, three groups reported discovering CD154, which is the molecular basis of T cell helper function.

In order to be effective, helper T cells must determine which cytokines will allow the immune system to be most useful or beneficial for the host. Understanding exactly how helper T cells respond to immune challenges is currently of major interest in [[immunology]], because such knowledge may be very useful in the treatment of [[disease]] and in increasing the effectiveness of [[vaccination]].\n\n=== T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model ===\nProliferating helper T cells that develop into effector T cells differentiate into two major subtypes of cells known as T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 cells (also known as Type 1 and Type 2 helper T cells, respectively).\n\nT<sub>h</sub>1 helper cells lead to an increased cell-mediated response, typically against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. They are triggered by the polarising cytokine IL-12 and their effector cytokines are IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2. The main effector cells of T<sub>h</sub>1 immunity are macrophages as well as CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IFN-\u03b3 CD4 T cells. The key T<sub>h</sub>1 transcription factors are STAT4 and T-bet. IFN-\u03b3 secreted by CD4 T cells can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 can activate iNOS to produce NOx free radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa.

[[Interleukin-4]] acts on helper T cells to promote the production of T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines (including itself; it is auto-regulatory), while [[interleukin-10]] (IL-10) inhibits a variety of cytokines including [[interleukin-2]] and [[interferon-gamma|IFN-\u03b3]] in helper T cells and IL-12 in dendritic cells and macrophages. The combined action of these two cytokines suggests that once the T cell has decided to produce these cytokines, that decision is preserved (and also encourages other T cells to do the same).\n|}\n\nWhile we know about the types of cytokine patterns helper T cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided. Various evidence suggests that the type of APC presenting the antigen to the T cell has a major influence on its profile. Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, but our understanding is nowhere near complete.\n\n===T<sub>h</sub>17 helper cells===\n{{Main|T helper 17 cell}}\n[[T helper 17 cell|T<sub>h</sub>17 helper cells]] are a subset of [[T helper cells]] developmentally distinct from T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 lineages producing [[interleukin 17]] (IL-17).\nT<sub>h</sub> cells produce IL-17 which is a pro inflammatory substance.

For example, the T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokine [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]] inhibits cytokine production of both T<sub>h</sub> subsets in humans. Human IL-10 (hIL-10) suppresses the proliferation and cytokine production of all T cells and the activity of macrophages, but continues to stimulate [[plasma cells]], ensuring that antibody production still occurs. As such, hIL-10 is not believed to truly promote the T<sub>h</sub>2 response in humans, but acts to prevent over-stimulation of helper T cells while still maximising the production of [[antibody|antibodies]].\n\nThere are also other types of T cells that can influence the expression and activation of helper T cells, such as natural [[regulatory T cells]], along with less common cytokine profiles such as the [[T helper 3 cell|T<sub>h</sub>3]] subset of helper T cells. Terms such as \"regulatory\" and \"suppression\" have become ambiguous after the discovery that helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are also capable of regulating (and suppressing) their own responses outside of dedicated regulatory T cells.\n\nOne major difference between regulatory T cells and effector T cells is that regulatory T cells typically serve to modulate and deactivate the immune response, while effector T cell groups usually begin with immune-promoting cytokines and then switch to inhibitory cytokines later in their life cycle. The latter is a feature of T<sub>h</sub>3 cells, which transform into a regulatory subset after its initial activation and cytokine production.\n\nBoth [[regulatory T cells]] and T<sub>h</sub>3 cells produce the cytokine [[TGF \u03b2|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-\u03b2) and IL-10. Both cytokines are inhibitory to helper T cells; TGF-\u03b2 suppresses the activity of most of the immune system. There is evidence to suggest that TGF-\u03b2 may not suppress activated Th2 cells as effectively as it might suppress naive cells, but it is not typically considered a Th2 cytokine.\n\nThe characterisation of another novel T helper subtype, [[T helper 17 cell]]s (T<sub>h</sub>17)<ref name=\"Harrington2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Harrington LE, Hatton RD, Mangan PR, Turner H, Murphy TL, Murphy KM, Weaver CT | title = Interleukin 17-producing CD4+ effector T cells develop via a lineage distinct from the T helper type 1 and 2 lineages | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 1123\u201332 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16200070 | doi = 10.1038/ni1254 }}</ref> has cast further doubt on the basic T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model.

By this mechanism they provide the immune system with \"memory\" against previously encountered pathogens.\n\n== Role in disease ==\nConsidering the diverse and important role helper T cells play in the immune system, it is not surprising that these cells often influence the immune response against disease. They also appear to make occasional mistakes, or generate responses that would be politely considered non-beneficial. In the worst-case scenario, the helper T cell response could lead to a disaster and the fatality of the host. Fortunately this is a very rare occurrence.\n\n=== Antitumor immunity ===\n{{Main|CD4+ T cells and antitumor immunity}}\n\n=== Hypersensitivity ===\nThe immune system must achieve a balance of sensitivity in order to respond to foreign antigens without responding to the antigens of the host itself. When the immune system responds to very low levels of antigen that it usually shouldn't respond to, a [[hypersensitivity]] response occurs. Hypersensitivity is believed to be the cause of [[allergy]] and some [[auto-immune disease]].\n\nHypersensitivity reactions can be divided into four types:\n* [[Type 1 hypersensitivity]] includes common immune disorders such as [[asthma]], [[allergic rhinitis]] (hay fever), [[eczema]], [[urticaria]] (hives) and [[anaphylaxis]]. These reactions all involve [[IgE]] [[antibody|antibodies]], which require a T<sub>h</sub>2 response during helper T cell development. Preventive treatments, such as [[corticosteroids]] and [[montelukast]], focus on suppressing mast cells or other allergic cells; T cells do not play a primary role during the actual inflammatory response. It's important to note that the numeral allocation of hypersensitivity \"types\" does not correlate (and is completely unrelated) to the \"response\" in the T<sub>h</sub> model.\n* [[Type II hypersensitivity|Type 2]] and [[Type 3 hypersensitivity]] both involve complications from auto-immune or low affinity antibodies. In both of these reactions, T cells may play an accomplice role in generating these auto-specific antibodies, although some of these reactions under Type 2 hypersensitivity would be considered normal in a healthy immune system (for example, [[Rhesus factor#Hemolytic disease of the newborn|Rhesus factor reactions]] during child-birth is a normal immune response against child antigens). The understanding of the role of helper T cells in these responses is limited but it is generally thought that T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines would promote such disorders. For example, studies have suggested that [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]] (SLE) and other auto-immune diseases of similar nature can be linked to the production of T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines.\n* [[Type 4 hypersensitivity]], also known as [[Hypersensitivity#Coombs and Gell classification|delayed type hypersensitivity]], are caused via the over-stimulation of immune cells, commonly [[lymphocytes]] and [[macrophages]], resulting in chronic [[inflammation]] and cytokine release. Antibodies do not play a direct role in this allergy type. T cells play an important role in this hypersensitivity, as they activate against the stimulus itself and promote the activation of other cells; particularly macrophages via T<sub>h</sub>1 cytokines.\n\nOther cellular hypersensitivities include [[cytotoxic T cell]] mediated [[auto-immune disease]], and a similar phenomenon; [[transplant rejection]]. Helper T cells are required to fuel the development of these diseases. In order to create sufficient [[Autoimmunity|auto-reactive]] killer T cells, [[interleukin-2]] must be produced, and this is supplied by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can also stimulate cells such as [[natural killer cell]]s and macrophages via cytokines such as [[interferon-gamma]], encouraging these cytotoxic cells to kill host cells in certain circumstances.\n\nThe mechanism that killer T cells use during auto-immunity is almost identical to their response against [[viruses]], and some viruses have been accused of causing auto-immune diseases such as [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes mellitus]]. Cellular auto-immune disease occurs because the host antigen recognition systems fail, and the [[immune system]] believes, by mistake, that a host antigen is foreign. As a result, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells treat the host cell presenting that antigen as infected, and go on to destroy all host cells (or in the case of transplant rejection, transplant organ) that express that antigen.\n\nSome of this section is a simplification. Many auto-immune diseases are more complex. A well-known example is [[rheumatoid arthritis]], where both antibodies and immune cells are known to play a role in the pathology. Generally the immunology of most auto-immune diseases is not well understood.\n\n=== HIV infection ===\nPerhaps the best example of the importance of [[CD4|CD4<sup>+</sup>]] T cells is demonstrated with [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) infection. HIV mainly targets lymphoid CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but can infect other cells that express CD4 such as [[macrophages]] and [[dendritic cells]] (both groups express CD4 at low levels).\n\nIt has been proposed that during the non-symptomatic phase of HIV infection, the virus has a relatively low affinity towards T cells (and has a higher affinity for macrophages), resulting in a slow kill rate of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by the immune system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This is initially compensated for via the production of new helper T cells from the [[thymus]] (originally from the [[bone marrow]]). Once the virus becomes [[HIV#Tropism|lymphotropic]] (or T-tropic) however, it begins to infect CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells far more efficiently (likely due to a change in the [[co-receptor]]s it binds to during infection), and the immune system is overwhelmed. Of note, recent studies suggest that only ~5% of the lymphoid-derived CD4 T cells targeted by HIV are permissive and become productively infected with the virus. More than 95% of the CD4 T cells that die are resting and are unable to support productive infection. These cells undergo abortive infection with HIV.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Doitsh G. | year = 2010 | title = Abortive HIV Infection Mediates CD4 T Cell Depletion and Inflammation in Human Lymphoid Tissue | url = http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(10)01245-6 | journal = Cell | volume =  143| issue = 5| pages = 789\u2013801 | pmid = 21111238 | pmc = 3026834 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.001 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Cell death is triggered when the host cell detects HIV foreign DNA intermediates and initiates a suicidal death pathway in an attempt to protect the host, leading to [[caspase-1]] activation in [[inflammasome]]s, thus causing [[pyroptosis]] (a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death).<ref name=\"Doitsh_2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Doitsh G, Galloway NL, Geng X, Yang Z, Monroe KM, Zepeda O, Hunt PW, Hatano H, Sowinski S, Mu\u00f1oz-Arias I, Greene WC | title = Cell death by pyroptosis drives CD4 T-cell depletion in HIV-1 infection | journal = Nature | volume = 505 | issue = 7484 | pages = 509\u201314 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24356306 | pmc = 4047036 | doi = 10.1038/nature12940 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Monroe KM | year = 2013 | title = IFI16 DNA Sensor Is Required for Death of Lymphoid CD4 T Cells Abortively Infected with HIV | url = | journal = Science | volume =  343| issue = 6169| pages =  428\u201332| doi = 10.1126/science.1243640 | pmid = 24356113 | pmc=3976200|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nAt this point chronic inflammation ensues, and functional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell levels begin to decrease, eventually to a point where the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population is too small to recognize the full range of [[antigen]]s that could potentially be detected. The depletion of CD4 T cells and the development of chronic inflammation are signature processes in HIV pathogenesis that propel progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]). CD4 T cell depleted to the cell count of less than 200cell/\u03bcL in blood during AIDS allows various [[pathogens]] to escape T cell recognition, thus allowing [[opportunistic infection]]s that would normally elicit a helper T cell response to bypass the immune system.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CD4 Count|url = https://www.aids.gov/hiv-aids-basics/just-diagnosed-with-hiv-aids/understand-your-test-results/cd4-count/|website = www.aids.gov|accessdate = 2015-04-30}}</ref> While these complete bypass situations only occur when the helper T cell response is absolutely necessary for infection clearance, most infections increase in severity and/or duration because the immune system's helper T cells provide less efficient immune response.\n\nTwo components of the immune system are particularly affected in AIDS, due to its CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell dependency:\n\n#[[Cytotoxic T cell|CD8]]<sup>+</sup> T cells are not stimulated as effectively during the AIDS stage of HIV infection, making AIDS patients very susceptible to most viruses, including HIV itself. This decline in killing of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells results in the virus being produced for a longer period (the infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are not killed as quickly), increasing the proliferation of the virus, and accelerating the development of the disease.\n# [[Antibody class switching]] declines significantly once helper T cell function fails. The immune system loses its ability to improve the affinity of their antibodies, and are unable to generate B cells that can produce antibody groups such as [[IgG]] and [[IgA]]. These effects are primarily due to the loss of any helper T cell that can interact with the B lymphocyte correctly. Another symptom of AIDS is the reduction in antibody levels due to a decrease in T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines (and less interactions by helper T cells). All of these complications result in an increased susceptibility to aggressive bacterial infections, especially in areas of the body not accessible by [[IgM]] antibodies.\n\nIf the patient does not respond to (or does not receive) [[Management of HIV/AIDS|HIV treatment]] they will succumb usually to either cancers or infections; the immune system finally reaches a point where it is no longer coordinated or stimulated enough to deal with the disease.\n\nInhibition of CD4 T-cell expansion during HIV infection may occur due to microbial translocation in an IL-10-dependent way. Triggering PD-1 expressed on activated monocytes by its ligand PD-L1, induces IL-10 production which inhibits CD4 T-cell function.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Said E.A. |author2=Dupuy F.P. |author3=Trautmann L. |author4=Zhang Y. |author5=Shi Y. |author6=El-Far M. |author7=Hill B.J. |author8=Noto A. |author9=Ancuta P. |author10=Peretz Y. |author11=Fonseca S.G. |author12=Van Grevenynghe J. |author13=Boulassel M.R. |author14=Bruneau J. |author15=Shoukry N.H. |author16=Routy J.P. |author17=Douek D.C. |author18=Haddad E.K. |author19=Sekaly R.P. | year = 2010\n | title = Programmed death-1-induced interleukin-10 production by monocytes impairs CD4+ T cell activation during HIV infection\n | journal = Nature Medicine\n | volume = 16\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 452\u2013459\n | doi = 10.1038/nm.2106\n | pmid = 20208540\n | pmc=4229134\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[CD4+/CD8+ ratio]]\n* [[CD4+ T cells and antitumor immunity]]\n*[[Cytotoxic T cell|CD8+ T cells]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Kanno Y, Vahedi G, Hirahara K, Singleton K, O'Shea JJ | year = 2012 | title = Transcriptional and Epigenetic Control of T Helper Cell Specification: Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Commitment and Plasticity | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 707\u2013731 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075058| pmid = 22224760 | pmc = 3314163 }}\n* In SLE patients, T helper type 1 polarisation is more abundant rather than type 2, where the main cytokine profile are Inf gama from T cells and its consequence interferon alpha high range production by DC .\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*{{cite web |url= http://www.tcells.org/scientific/helper/ |title= T-cell Group |publisher= [[Cardiff University]] |website= T-Cells }}\n*{{cite journal |title= Dissecting How CD4 T Cells Are Lost During HIV Infection |pmid= 26962940 | doi=10.1016/j.chom.2016.02.012 |pmc=4835240 |volume=19 |issue= 3 |journal=Cell Host Microbe |pages=280\u201391 |vauthors=Doitsh G, Greene WC|year= 2016 }}\n\n{{Lymphocytes}}\n{{Lymphocytic immune system}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:T Helper Cell}}\n[[Category:T cells|Helper]]\n[[Category:Human cells]]\n", "name_user": "Kaltenmeyer", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up, replaced: it's own \u2192  its own", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T_helper_cell"}
