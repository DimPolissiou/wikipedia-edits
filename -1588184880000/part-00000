His surname changed twice: he was born with the name Wesley, which he changed to Wesley-Pole following an inheritance in 1781. In 1789 the spelling was updated to Wellesley-Pole, just as other members of the family had changed Wesley to Wellesley.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:William Wellesley-Pole, 1st Baron Maryborough, and 3rd Earl of Mornington (1763-1845), by Benjamin West (1738-1820).jpg|thumb|200px|The young William Wesley aged 14, painted in 1777 by [[Benjamin West]]]]\nHe was born as William Wesley, at Dangan Castle, the second son of [[Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington]], by his marriage to the Hon. Annie Hill, a daughter of [[Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon]]. He was the younger brother of [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wesley]], later [[Marquess Wellesley]], and the elder brother of  [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur]], who became [[Duke of Wellington]], and of [[Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley|Henry]].\n\n==Early life==\nWesley was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] (1774\u20131776) before entering the [[Royal Navy]] as a [[midshipman]], serving in the Navy between 1777 and 1783; most notably aboard [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']], a new ship launched in 1777, at the [[Battle of Grenada]] of 1779.<ref>National Maritime Museum Records, Greenwich</ref>\n\n==Pole inheritance==\n[[File:William Pole of Ballyfin (d 1781), English School of the 18th Century.jpg|thumb|200px|William Pole (died 1781), of [[Ballyfin]], Ireland, who at his death bequeathed his estate to William Wesley]]\nDue to the debts of their father, the Wesley family entered into financial stringency. This was partially alleviated following the death in 1781 of the childless William Pole, of [[Ballyfin]] in Ireland, his godfather and the husband of his great-aunt Ann Colley, who bequeathed his estates to Wesley, on the condition which was usual in such situations that he should adopt the surname \"Pole\". Pole was descended from Peryam Pole, third son of the antiquary [[William Pole (antiquary)|Sir William Pole]] (1561\u20131635) of [[Old Shute House|Shute House]], Devon, a brother of [[Pole baronets|Sir John Pole, 1st Baronet]]. He had married Ann Colley, the sister of Wesley's grandfather [[Baron Mornington|Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington]] (1690\u20131758). This Wesley had been born Richard Colley, but had changed his name in 1728, following an inheritance, to Wesley. Thus it was that in 1781, in accordance with the Will of his great-uncle William Pole, Wesley changed his name to Wesley-Pole.<ref>Ancestry from Collins Peerage, 1812, (9 vols.) vol. 8, pp. 540\u2013545</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nA [[Tory (political faction)|Tory]], Mornington was a Member of the [[Irish House of Commons|Irish Parliament]] for [[Trim (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Trim]] from 1783 to 1790 and of the [[British House of Commons]] for [[East Looe (UK Parliament constituency)|East Looe]] from 1790 to 1795 and [[Queen's County (UK Parliament constituency)|Queen's County]] from 1801 to 1821. He served as [[Secretary of the Admiralty]] under the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] between 1807 and 1809 and as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] under [[Spencer Perceval]] between 1809 and 1812 and was also a Lord of the Irish Treasury between 1809 and 1811 and [[Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer]] between 1811 and 1812. Mornington was sworn of both the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|British Privy Council]] and the [[Privy Council of Ireland|Irish Privy Council]] in 1809. He served in [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool's]] government from 1814 to 1823 as [[Master of the Mint]]. In 1821 he was elevated to the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] as '''Baron Maryborough''', of Maryborough in the Queen's County (now Portlaoise, Co. Laois). In 1823 he was appointed [[Custos Rotulorum of Queen's County]] for life. From 1823 to 1830 he was [[Master of the Buckhounds]] and from 1834 to 1835 [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]]. From 1838 he held the honorary position of [[Captain of Deal Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eastkent.freeuk.com/deal/castle/captains.htm|title=Captains of Deal Castle|publisher=East Kent freeuk|accessdate= 10 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Succession to earldom==\nOn the death in 1842 of his elder brother [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley and 2nd Earl of Mornington]], he succeeded as [[Earl of Mornington|3rd Earl of Mornington]].\n\n==Marriage and progeny==\nIn 1784 Lord Mornington married [[Katherine Wellesley-Pole, Countess of Mornington|Katherine Elizabeth Forbes]], daughter of Admiral [[John Forbes (Royal Navy officer)|John Forbes]] and granddaughter of the [[George Forbes, 3rd Earl of Granard]], and of  [[William Capell, 3rd Earl of Essex]]. It was said that among the 1st Earl's sons, they had the only happy marriage. They had the following progeny, one son and three daughters:\n[[File:The Wellesley-Pole sisters, by Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830).jpg|thumb|200px|The Wellesley-Pole sisters, by Thomas Lawrence (1769\u20131830).

His surname changed twice: he was born with the name Wesley, which he changed to Wesley-Pole following an inheritance in 1781. In 1789 the spelling was updated to Wellesley-Pole, just as other members of the family had changed Wesley to Wellesley.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:William Wellesley-Pole, 1st Baron Maryborough, and 3rd Earl of Mornington (1763-1845), by Benjamin West (1738-1820).jpg|thumb|200px|The young William Wesley aged 14, painted in 1777 by [[Benjamin West]]]]\nHe was born as William Wesley, at Dangan Castle, the second son of [[Garret Wesley, 1st Earl of Mornington]], by his marriage to the Hon. Annie Hill, a daughter of [[Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon]]. He was the younger brother of [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wesley]], later [[Marquess Wellesley]], and the elder brother of  [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Arthur]], who became [[Duke of Wellington]], and of [[Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley|Henry]].\n\n==Early life==\nWesley was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] (1774\u20131776) before entering the [[Royal Navy]] as a [[midshipman]], serving in the Navy between 1777 and 1783; most notably aboard [[HMS Lion (1777)|HMS ''Lion'']], a new ship launched in 1777, at the [[Battle of Grenada]] of 1779.<ref>National Maritime Museum Records, Greenwich</ref>\n\n==Pole inheritance==\n[[File:William Pole of Ballyfin (d 1781), English School of the 18th Century.jpg|thumb|200px|William Pole (died 1781), of [[Ballyfin]], Ireland, who at his death bequeathed his estate to William Wesley]]\nDue to the debts of their father, the Wesley family entered into financial stringency. This was partially alleviated following the death in 1781 of the childless William Pole, of [[Ballyfin]] in Ireland, his godfather and the husband of his great-aunt Ann Colley, who bequeathed his estates to Wesley, on the condition which was usual in such situations that he should adopt the surname \"Pole\". Pole was descended from Peryam Pole, third son of the antiquary [[William Pole (antiquary)|Sir William Pole]] (1561\u20131635) of [[Old Shute House|Shute House]], Devon, a brother of [[Pole baronets|Sir John Pole, 1st Baronet]]. He had married Ann Colley, the sister of Wesley's grandfather [[Baron Mornington|Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington]] (1690\u20131758). This Wesley had been born Richard Colley, but had changed his name in 1728, following an inheritance, to Wesley. Thus it was that in 1781, in accordance with the Will of his great-uncle William Pole, Wesley changed his name to Wesley-Pole.<ref>Ancestry from Collins Peerage, 1812, (9 vols.) vol. 8, pp. 540\u2013545</ref>\n\n==Political career==\nA [[Tory (political faction)|Tory]], Mornington was a Member of the [[Irish House of Commons|Irish Parliament]] for [[Trim (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Trim]] from 1783 to 1790 and of the [[British House of Commons]] for [[East Looe (UK Parliament constituency)|East Looe]] from 1790 to 1795 and [[Queen's County (UK Parliament constituency)|Queen's County]] from 1801 to 1821. He served as [[Secretary of the Admiralty]] under the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]] between 1807 and 1809 and as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] under [[Spencer Perceval]] between 1809 and 1812 and was also a Lord of the Irish Treasury between 1809 and 1811 and [[Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer]] between 1811 and 1812. Mornington was sworn of both the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|British Privy Council]] and the [[Privy Council of Ireland|Irish Privy Council]] in 1809. He served in [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool's]] government from 1814 to 1823 as [[Master of the Mint]]. In 1821 he was elevated to the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]] as '''Baron Maryborough''', of Maryborough in the Queen's County (now Portlaoise, Co. Laois). In 1823 he was appointed [[Custos Rotulorum of Queen's County]] for life. From 1823 to 1830 he was [[Master of the Buckhounds]] and from 1834 to 1835 [[United Kingdom Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]].

When chased, it runs in a zigzag pattern, running up to {{convert|18|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The cottontail prefers an area where it can hide quickly but be out in the open. Forests, swamps, thickets, bushes, or open areas where shelter is close by are optimal habitation sites for this species. Cottontails do not dig burrows, but rather rest in a ''form'', a shallow, scratched-out depression in a clump of grass or under brush. It may use the dens of [[hog]]s as a temporary home or during heavy snow.<ref>Merritt, Joseph E.

The redigestion of pellets greatly increases the nutritional value of dietary items.<ref name=r9/><ref name=r48/>\n\nIn summer, eastern cottontails consume tender green herbaceous vegetation when it is available. In many areas [[Kentucky bluegrass]] (''Poa pratense'') and [[Canada bluegrass]] (''P. compressa'') are important dietary components.<ref name=r10/> Other favored species include clovers (''Trifolium'' spp.) and crabgrasses (''Digitaria'' spp.).<ref name=r34/> In Connecticut important summer foods include clovers, alfalfa, timothy (''Phleum pratense''), bluegrasses (''Poa'' spp.), quackgrass (''Elytrigia repens''), crabgrasses, redtop (''Agrostis alba''), ragweed (''Ambrosia psilostachya''), goldenrods (''Solidago'' spp.), plantains (''Plantago'' spp.), [[chickweed]] (''Stellaria media''), and [[dandelion]] (''Taraxacum officinale''). Eastern cottontails also consume many domestic crops.<ref name=r27/>\n\nDuring the dormant season, or when green vegetation is covered with snow, eastern cottontails consume twigs, buds, and bark of woody vegetation.<ref name=r34/> In [[Connecticut]], important winter foods include [[gray birch]] (''Betula populifolia''), [[red maple]], and [[smooth sumac]] (''Rhus glabra'').<ref name=r15/>\n\n==Mortality==\nIn Kansas, the largest cause of mortality of radiotracked eastern cottontails was predation (43%), followed by research mortalities{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} (19%), and [[tularemia]] (18%). A major cause of eastern cottontail mortality is collision with automobiles. In Missouri, it was estimated that ten eastern cottontails are killed annually per mile of road. The peak period of highway mortality is in spring (March through May); roadside vegetation greens up before adjacent fields and is highly attractive to eastern cottontails.<ref name=r52/>\n\nAnnual adult survival is estimated at 20%. Average longevity is 15 months in the wild; the longest-lived wild individual on record was five years old.

Eastern cottontails typically inhabit one home range throughout their lifetime, but home range shifts in response to vegetation changes and weather are common.<ref name=r1/> In New England, eastern cottontail home ranges average {{convert|1.4|acres|ha|abbr=off}} for adult males and {{convert|1.2|acres|ha|abbr=off}} for adult females but vary in size from {{convert|0.5|to|40|acres|ha|abbr=off}}, depending on season, habitat quality, and individual. The largest ranges are occupied by adult males during the breeding season. In southwestern Wisconsin adult male home ranges averaged {{convert|6.9|acres|ha|abbr=off}} in spring, increased to {{convert|10|acres|ha|abbr=off}} in early summer, and decreased to {{convert|3.7|acres|ha|abbr=off}} by late summer.<ref name=r61/> Daily activity is usually restricted to 10% to 20% of the overall home range.<ref name=r1>Allen, A.

Its underside fur is white. There is a rusty patch on the tail. Its appearance differs from that of a [[hare]] in that it has a brownish-gray coloring around the head and neck. The body is lighter color with a white underside on the tail. It has large brown eyes and large ears to see and listen for danger. In winter the cottontail's [[pelage]] is more gray than brown. The kits develop the same coloring after a few weeks, but they also have a white blaze that goes down their forehead; this marking eventually disappears.

When chased, it runs in a zigzag pattern, running up to {{convert|18|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. The cottontail prefers an area where it can hide quickly but be out in the open. Forests, swamps, thickets, bushes, or open areas where shelter is close by are optimal habitation sites for this species. Cottontails do not dig burrows, but rather rest in a ''form'', a shallow, scratched-out depression in a clump of grass or under brush. It may use the dens of [[groundhog]]s as a temporary home or during heavy snow.<ref>Merritt, Joseph E. (1987) ''Guide to the Mammals of Pennsylvania'', University of Pittsburgh Press, p. 123, {{ISBN|0822953935}}.</ref>\n\nEastern cottontails are [[crepuscular]] to nocturnal feeders; although they usually spend most of the daylight hours resting in shallow depressions under vegetative cover or other shelter, they can be seen at any time of day.<ref name=r48/> Eastern cottontails are most active when visibility is limited, such as rainy or foggy nights.<ref name=r27/> Eastern cottontails usually move only short distances, and they may remain sitting very still for up to 15 minutes at a time. Eastern cottontails are active year-round. <ref name=r48/>\n\n==Reproduction==\n[[File:Sylvilagus floridanus babies.jpg|thumb|Litter and nesting material]]\n[[File:OurPets3.gif|thumb|Three-week-old kit]]\n[[File:Eastern cottontail kit.jpg|thumb|Juvenile, unknown age, showing white blaze on forehead]]\n\nThe onset of breeding varies between populations and within populations from year to year. The eastern cottontail breeding season begins later with higher latitudes and elevations. Temperature rather than diet has been suggested as a primary factor controlling onset of breeding; many studies correlate severe weather with delays in the onset of breeding.<ref name=r10>{{cite journal|author1=Chapman, Joseph A. |author2=Hockman, J.

Their eyes begin to open by four to seven days. Young begin to move out of the nest for short trips by 12 to 16 days and are completely weaned and independent by four to five weeks.<ref name=r9/><ref name=r63/> Litters disperse at about seven weeks. Females do not stay in the nest with the young but return to the opening of the nest to nurse, usually twice a day.<ref name=r48/><ref name=r63/>\n\nReproductive maturity occurs at about two to three months of age. A majority of females first breed the spring following birth; but 10% to 36% of females breed as juveniles (i.e., summer of the year they were born).<ref name=r52/> Males will mate with more than one female. Female rabbits can have one to seven litters of one to twelve young, called kits, in a year; however, they average three to four litters per year, and the average number of kits is five.<ref name=UMich/> In the South female eastern cottontails have more litters per year (up to seven) but fewer young per litter.<ref name=r48>Nowak, Ronald M.; Paradiso, John L.

Food items include bark, twigs, leaves, fruit, buds, flowers, grass seeds, sedge fruits, and rush seeds.<ref name=r9/> There is a preference for small material: branches, twigs, and stems up to {{convert|0.25|in|cm|abbr=on}}. Leporids including eastern cottontails are [[coprophagous]], producing two types of fecal pellets, one of which is consumed. The redigestion of pellets greatly increases the nutritional value of dietary items.<ref name=r9/><ref name=r48/>\n\nIn summer, eastern cottontails consume tender green herbaceous vegetation when it is available. In many areas [[Kentucky bluegrass]] (''Poa pratense'') and [[Canada bluegrass]] (''P. compressa'') are important dietary components.<ref name=r10/> Other favored species include clovers (''Trifolium'' spp.) and crabgrasses (''Digitaria'' spp.).<ref name=r34/> In Connecticut important summer foods include clovers, alfalfa, timothy (''Phleum pratense''), bluegrasses (''Poa'' spp.), quackgrass (''Elytrigia repens''), crabgrasses, redtop (''Agrostis alba''), ragweed (''Ambrosia psilostachya''), goldenrods (''Solidago'' spp.), plantains (''Plantago'' spp.), [[chickweed]] (''Stellaria media''), and [[dandelion]] (''Taraxacum officinale''). Eastern cottontails also consume many domestic crops.<ref name=r27/>\n\nDuring the dormant season, or when green vegetation is covered with snow, eastern cottontails consume twigs, buds, and bark of woody vegetation.<ref name=r34/> In [[Connecticut]], important winter foods include [[gray birch]] (''Betula populifolia''), [[red maple]], and [[smooth sumac]] (''Rhus glabra'').<ref name=r15/>\n\n==Mortality==\nIn Kansas, the largest cause of mortality of radiotracked eastern cottontails was predation (43%), followed by research mortalities{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} (19%), and [[tularemia]] (18%). A major cause of eastern cottontail mortality is collision with automobiles. In Missouri, it was estimated that ten eastern cottontails are killed annually per mile of road. The peak period of highway mortality is in spring (March through May); roadside vegetation greens up before adjacent fields and is highly attractive to eastern cottontails.<ref name=r52/>\n\nAnnual adult survival is estimated at 20%. Average longevity is 15 months in the wild; the longest-lived wild individual on record was five years old. Captive eastern cottontails have lived to at least nine years of age.<ref name=r48/>\n\nEastern cottontails are hosts to [[fleas]], [[ticks]], [[lice]], [[cestodes]], [[nematodes]], [[trematodes]], gray [[flesh fly]] larvae, [[botfly]] larvae, [[tularemia]], shopes [[fibroma]], [[torticollis]], and cutaneous [[streptothricosis]].<ref name=r27/> Further summary of diseases and pests is available.<ref name=r9>Chapman, Joseph A.; Hockman, J.

Due to their often large populations in Eastern North America, they form a major component of several predators' diets. Major predators of eastern cottontail include domestic cats and dogs, [[fox]]es (''[[Vulpes]]'' and ''[[Urocyon]]'' spp.), [[coyote]] (''C. latrans''), [[bobcat]] (''Lynx rufus''), [[weasel]]s (''Mustela'' spp.), [[raccoon]] (''Procyon lotor''), [[mink]] (''M. vison''), [[great horned owl]] (''Bubo virginianus''), [[barred owl]] (''Strix varia''), [[hawk]]s (principally ''Buteo'' spp.), [[corvid]]s (''Corvus'' spp.), and [[snake]]s.<ref name=r27/>\n\nPredators that take nestlings include raccoon, badger (''Taxidea taxus''), skunks (''Mephitis'' and ''Spilogale'' spp.), and [[Virginia opossum]] (''Didelphis virginiana'').<ref name=r52/> In central Missouri, eastern cottontails comprised the majority of biomass in the diet of red-tailed hawks (''Buteo jamaicensis'') during the nesting season. In Pennsylvania, the chief predator of eastern cottontails is the [[great horned owl]].<ref name=r52>Rue, Leonard Lee, III. (1965). ''Cottontail''. New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Company</ref> In the Southwest cottontails including eastern cottontail comprise 7 to 25% of the diets of [[northern goshawk]] (''Accipiter gentilis''). In Texas, eastern cottontails are preyed on by coyotes more heavily in early spring and in fall than in summer or winter. In southwestern North Dakota, cottontails (both eastern and desert cottontail ''Sylvilagus auduboni'') were major prey items in the diets of bobcats.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Trevor, John T. |author2=Seabloom, Robert W. |author3=Allen, Stephen H. |year= 1989|title= Food habits in relation to sex and age of bobcats from southwestern North Dakota|journal= Prairie Naturalist|volume= 21|issue=3|pages= 163\u2013168}}</ref>\n\nJuvenile eastern cottontails are rare in the diet of [[short-eared owl]]s (''Asio flammeus'').

The screenplay, by [[Jeffrey Boam]], is based on the 1979 [[The Dead Zone (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Stephen King]]. The film stars [[Christopher Walken]], [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]], [[Tom Skerritt]], [[Herbert Lom]], [[Martin Sheen]], [[Anthony Zerbe]] and [[Colleen Dewhurst]]. Walken plays a schoolteacher, [[Johnny Smith (Dead Zone)|Johnny Smith]], who awakens from a coma to find he has psychic powers. The film received positive reviews and became the basis for a television series of the [[The Dead Zone (TV series)|same name]] in the early 2000s, starring [[Anthony Michael Hall]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the town of [[Castle Rock (Stephen King)|Castle Rock]], [[Maine]], John Smith, a young schoolteacher, is in love with his colleague Sarah Bracknell. After having a headache following a ride on a roller coaster, Johnny politely declines when Sarah asks if he wants to spend the night with her. As he drives home through stormy weather, he has a car accident that leaves him in a coma. He awakens under the care of neurologist Dr. Sam Weizak. He finds that five years have passed, and that Sarah is now married and has a child.\n\nJohnny soon discovers that he now has the psychic ability to learn aspects of a person's life through physical contact with them. As he touches a nurse's hand, he has a vision of her daughter trapped in a fire. He also sees that Weizak's mother, long thought to have died during [[World War II]], is still alive, and that a reporter's sister killed herself. Johnny's mother has a heart attack and dies after being visited by Johnny in the hospital. \n\nAs news of his \"gift\" spreads, Johnny is asked by Sheriff George Bannerman for help with a series of murders, but he wishes to be left alone and therefore declines. Sarah visits with her infant son and she and Johnny consummate their relationship, though she points out that they will avoid that aspect in the future. Having a change of heart, Johnny agrees to help Bannerman and, through a vision at the crime scene, he discovers that Bannerman's deputy Frank Dodd is the killer. Before they can arrest him, Dodd kills himself. Johnny is then shot by Dodd's mother, who in turn is killed by Bannerman.\n\nA disillusioned Johnny, now barely able to walk, moves away and attempts to live a more isolated life. He takes on tutoring jobs for children, working from home until a wealthy man named Roger Stuart implores him to come visit and tutor his son, Chris. They form a friendship, but Johnny soon receives a vision of Chris and two other boys falling into an icy creek and drowning due to wearing heavy hockey equipment during a game. Despite Stuart's skepticism, Chris believes Johnny and stays home from the game. The other two boys fall in the ice and drown, much to Stuart's shock. Johnny then realizes he has a \"dead zone\" in his visions, where the future is not set, and he can actually change it.\n\nJohnny attends a rally for Greg Stillson, a [[third party (politics)|third-party]] candidate for the [[United States Senate]], for whom Sarah and her husband volunteer. Johnny shakes Stillson's hand and has a vision of him becoming president and ordering a [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|preemptive nuclear strike]] against the [[Soviet Union]] that results in a [[nuclear holocaust]]. He seeks Weizak's advice, asking, by way of example, if he would have killed [[Adolf Hitler]] if he had the chance, knowing in advance the atrocities Hitler would commit. Weizak replies that he would have had no choice but to kill him. Johnny leaves Sarah a letter, telling her that what he is about to do will cost him his life, but that it will be a sacrifice he is willing to make.\n\nJohnny loads a rifle and takes aim at Stillson at a rally, with Sarah in the audience. His shot misses the target, but Stillson grabs Sarah's baby and holds him as a human shield. When this happens, Johnny refuses to risk hitting the child. In that moment, a photographer snaps a picture of Stillson holding the baby. After Sarah finally gets ahold of her baby, and before Johnny attempts to fire again, he is shot by Stillson's bodyguard. Confronted by an angry Stillson, Johnny grabs his hand to see into his future. He now foresees Stillson's reputation and political ambitions being ruined; after the photograph of his cowardly act is published, Stillson will commit suicide. Johnny lies dying, satisfied that Stillson's career is forever destroyed and the nuclear war he would have incited will not occur. Sarah embraces Johnny and tells him she loves him as he dies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Johnny Smith (Dead Zone)|Johnny Smith]]\n* [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] as Sarah Bracknell\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Sheriff George Bannerman\n* [[Herbert Lom]] as Dr. Sam Weizak\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Roger Stuart\n* [[Colleen Dewhurst]] as Henrietta Dodd\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Greg Stillson\n* [[Nicholas Campbell]] as Deputy Frank Dodd\n* Simon Craig as Chris Stuart\n* G\u00e9za Kov\u00e1cs as Sonny\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAs King's novel ''The Dead Zone'' was released in 1979, [[Lorimar Film Entertainment]] began developing a film adaptation.

Boam told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, \"King's book is longer than it needed to be. The novel sprawls and it's episodic. What I did was ''use'' that episodic quality, because I saw ''The Dead Zone'' as a triptych.\"<ref name=\"cinefan_deadzone\"/> His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel's story,<ref name='hollywood_sk'>{{cite book | last1 = Magistrate | first1 = Tony | title = Hollywood's Stephen King | chapter = Defining Heroic Codes of Survival | publisher = Palgrave MacMillan | year = 2003 | location = New York City | pages = 120 | isbn = 0312293216}}</ref> including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor.<ref name=\"cinefan_deadzone\"/> Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam's \"triptych\" in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff in tracking down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson. Boam said that he enjoyed writing character development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities, and ultimately giving up his life for the greater good. \"It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation,\" he said. In Boam's first draft of the screenplay, Johnny does not die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg insisted that this \"trick ending\" be revised. Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.<ref name=\"cinefan_deadzone\"/>\n\nKing is reported to have told Cronenberg that the changes the director and Boam made to the story \"improved and intensified the power of the narrative.\"<ref name='sk_universe'/>  \n\nBefore Christopher Walken was cast as Johnny Smith, [[Bill Murray]] was considered for the role<ref>{{cite web|last=Locke|first=Greg W.|title=The Top 25 Roles Bill Murray Didn\u2019t Take|date=26 August 2011|url=http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125110247/http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 November 2011|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> as it was King's first choice.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray|date=17 February 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/|accessdate=25 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray|archivedate=20 May 2015}}</ref> Cronenberg initially wanted Nicholas Campbell to portray Johnny, but the director wound up casting him as the Castle Rock Killer instead.<ref name=cast>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SqXAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=hal+holbrook+the+dead+zone&source=bl&ots=7Gx0MTntdu&sig=SZqgFd1quxCxK17MKT59XiMBzeM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRk9z4yLnfAhUG3IMKHbCOCKUQ6AEwGXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=hal%20holbrook%20the%20dead%20zone&f=false|last=Mell|first=Eila|title=Casting Might-Have-Beens: A Film by Film Directory of Actors Considered for Roles Given to Others|year=2015|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476609768}}pages 66-67</ref> Cronenberg also wanted [[Hal Holbrook]] to portray Sheriff Bannerman but De Laurentiis objected.<ref name=cast/>\n\nIn addition to Donen, both [[John Badham]] and [[Michael Cimino]] were also considered to direct.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Why The Dead Zone Is One of the Best Stephen King Films|date=21 February 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/the-dead-zone/33989/why-the-dead-zone-is-one-of-the-best-stephen-king-films|accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nShooting started in early January 1983<ref>Lucas, p. 24</ref> and took place in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and the [[Regional Municipality of Niagara]] of Cronenberg's native [[Ontario]], Canada.

The [[gazebo]] was built by the film crew and donated to [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]].<ref name=afi/>\n\nAccording to a David Cronenberg interview on the DVD, ''The Dead Zone'' was filmed during a relentless deep freeze in southern Ontario which lasted for weeks, creating an authentic atmosphere of subzero temperatures and icy snow-packed terrain, which made for great natural shooting locations, in spite of it being almost too cold for cast and crew to tolerate at times. [[Canada's Wonderland]], a theme park which is 30&nbsp;km north of [[Toronto]]'s city limits, was also used as a filming location.\n\n===Music===\nThe music soundtrack, composed by [[Michael Kamen]], was recorded by The [[National Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[London]] at the famous EMI [[Abbey Road Studios]]. Michael Kamen conducted the recording sessions; the orchestra was contracted and led by [[Sidney Sax]]. This is the only Cronenberg film since ''[[The Brood]]'' (1979) for which [[Howard Shore]] was not composer.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2014}}\n''The Dead Zone'' received very positive reviews on release.<ref name=afi/> It holds a 91% approval rating on [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], which catalogs both contemporary and modern reviews from 43 critics. The site's consensus reads, \"''The Dead Zone'' combines taut direction from David Cronenberg and a rich performance from Christopher Walken to create one of the strongest Stephen King adaptations\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rottentomatoes.com/m/dead_zone/ |title=The Dead Zone |website=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2014-02-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago

praised Cronenberg's direction for successfully weaving the supernatural into the everyday, and noted believable performances by the entire cast, especially Walken: \"Walken does such a good job of portraying Johnny Smith, the man with the strange gift, that we forget this is science fiction or fantasy or whatever and just accept it as this guy's story.\" [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York

He seeks Weizak's advice, asking, by way of example, if he would have killed [[Adolf Hitler]] if he had the chance, knowing in advance the atrocities Hitler would commit. Weizak replies that he would have had no choice but to kill him. Johnny leaves Sarah a letter, telling her that what he is about to do will cost him his life, but that it will be a sacrifice he is willing to make.\n\nJohnny loads a rifle and takes aim at Stillson at a rally, with Sarah in the audience. His shot misses the target, but Stillson grabs Sarah's baby and holds him as a human shield. When this happens, Johnny refuses to risk hitting the child. In that moment, a photographer snaps a picture of Stillson holding the baby. After Sarah finally gets ahold of her baby, and before Johnny attempts to fire again, he is shot by Stilson's bodyguard. Confronted by an angry Stillson, Johnny grabs his hand to see into his future. He now foresees Stillson's reputation and political ambitions being ruined; after the photograph of his cowardly act is published, Stillson will commit suicide. Johnny lies dying, satisfied that Stillson's career is forever destroyed and the nuclear war he would have incited will not occur. Sarah embraces Johnny and tells him she loves him as he dies.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as [[Johnny Smith (Dead Zone)|Johnny Smith]]\n* [[Brooke Adams (actress)|Brooke Adams]] as Sarah Bracknell\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as Sheriff George Bannerman\n* [[Herbert Lom]] as Dr. Sam Weizak\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Roger Stuart\n* [[Colleen Dewhurst]] as Henrietta Dodd\n* [[Martin Sheen]] as Greg Stillson\n* [[Nicholas Campbell]] as Deputy Frank Dodd\n* Simon Craig as Chris Stuart\n* G\u00e9za Kov\u00e1cs as Sonny\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAs King's novel ''The Dead Zone'' was released in 1979, [[Lorimar Film Entertainment]] began developing a film adaptation.

Boam told writer Tim Lucas in 1983, \"King's book is longer than it needed to be. The novel sprawls and it's episodic. What I did was ''use'' that episodic quality, because I saw ''The Dead Zone'' as a triptych.\"<ref name=\"cinefan_deadzone\"/> His script was revised and condensed four times by Cronenberg, who eliminated large portions of the novel's story,<ref name='hollywood_sk'>{{cite book | last1 = Magistrate | first1 = Tony | title = Hollywood's Stephen King | chapter = Defining Heroic Codes of Survival | publisher = Palgrave MacMillan | year = 2003 | location = New York City | pages = 120 | isbn = 0312293216}}</ref> including plot points about Johnny Smith having a brain tumor.<ref name=\"cinefan_deadzone\"/> Cronenberg, Boam, and Hill had script meetings to revise the screenplay page by page. Boam's \"triptych\" in the screenplay surrounds three acts: the introduction of Johnny Smith before his car accident and after he awakes from a coma, a story about Smith assisting a sheriff in tracking down the Castle Rock Killer, and finally Johnny deciding to confront the politician Stillson. Boam said that he enjoyed writing character development for Smith, having him struggle with the responsibility of his psychic abilities, and ultimately giving up his life for the greater good. \"It was this theme that made me like the book, and I particularly enjoyed discovering it in what was essentially a genre piece, a work of exploitation,\" he said. In Boam's first draft of the screenplay, Johnny does not die at the end, but rather has a vision about the Castle Rock Killer, who is still alive and escaped from prison. Cronenberg insisted that this \"trick ending\" be revised. Boam submitted the final draft of the screenplay on November 8, 1982.<ref name=\"cinefan_deadzone\"/>\n\nKing is reported to have told Cronenberg that the changes the director and Boam made to the story \"improved and intensified the power of the narrative.\"<ref name='sk_universe'/>  \n\nBefore Christopher Walken was cast as Johnny Smith, [[Bill Murray]] was considered for the role<ref>{{cite web|last=Locke|first=Greg W.|title=The Top 25 Roles Bill Murray Didn\u2019t Take|date=26 August 2011|url=http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125110247/http://www.zecatalist.com/lists/the-top-25-roles-bob-murray-didnt-take/|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 November 2011|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> as it was King's first choice.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Bill Murray|date=17 February 2011|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray/|accessdate=25 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520115025/http://splitsider.com/2011/02/the-lost-roles-of-bill-murray|archivedate=20 May 2015}}</ref> Cronenberg initially wanted Nicholas Campbell to portray Johnny, but the director wound up casting him as the Castle Rock Killer instead.<ref name=cast>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1SqXAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA66&lpg=PA66&dq=hal+holbrook+the+dead+zone&source=bl&ots=7Gx0MTntdu&sig=SZqgFd1quxCxK17MKT59XiMBzeM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiRk9z4yLnfAhUG3IMKHbCOCKUQ6AEwGXoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=hal%20holbrook%20the%20dead%20zone&f=false|last=Mell|first=Eila|title=Casting Might-Have-Beens: A Film by Film Directory of Actors Considered for Roles Given to Others|year=2015|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476609768}}pages 66-67</ref> Cronenberg also wanted [[Hal Holbrook]] to portray Sheriff Bannerman but De Laurentiis objected.<ref name=cast/>\n\nIn addition to Donen, both [[John Badham]] and [[Michael Cimino]] were also considered to direct.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Why The Dead Zone Is One of the Best Stephen King Films|date=21 February 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/the-dead-zone/33989/why-the-dead-zone-is-one-of-the-best-stephen-king-films|accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Filming===\nShooting started in early January 1983<ref>Lucas, p. 24</ref> and took place in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] and the [[Regional Municipality of Niagara]] of Cronenberg's native [[Ontario]], Canada.
