{"title_page": "Solubility equilibrium", "text_new": "'''Solubility equilibrium''' is a type of [[dynamic equilibrium]] that exists when a [[chemical compound]] in the solid state is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with a [[solution]] of that compound. The solid may dissolve unchanged, with dissociation or with chemical reaction with another constituent of the solvent, such as acid or alkali. Each type of equilibrium is characterized by a temperature-dependent [[equilibrium constant]]. Solubility equilibria are important in pharmaceutical, environmental and many other scenarios.\n\n== Definitions ==\nA solubility equilibrium exists when a [[chemical compound]] in the solid state is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with a [[solution]] of that compound. The equilibrium is an example of [[dynamic equilibrium]] in that some individual molecules migrate between the solid and solution phases such that the rates of [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] are equal to one another. When equilibrium is established, the solution is said to be saturated. The [[concentration]] of the solute in a saturated solution is known as the [[solubility]]. Units of solubility may be molar (mol/[[litre|L]]) or expressed as mass per unit volume, such as \u03bcg/ml. Solubility is temperature-dependent. A solution containing a higher concentration of solute than the solubility is said to be [[supersaturation|supersaturated]]. A supersaturated solution may be induced to come to equilibrium by the addition of a \"seed\", which may be a tiny crystal of the solute or a tiny solid particle, which initiates precipitation.\n\nThere are three main types of solubility equilibria:\n# Simple dissolution.\n# Dissolution with dissociation reaction. This is characteristic of [[salts]]. The equilibrium constant is known in this case as a solubility product.\n# Dissolution with ionization reaction. This is characteristic of the dissolution of [[weak acid]]s or [[weak base]]s in aqueous media of varying [[pH]].\n\nIn each case an [[equilibrium constant]] can be specified as a quotient of [[activity (chemistry)|activities]]. This equilibrium constant is [[dimensionless]] as activity is a dimensionless quantity. However, use of activities is very inconvenient, so the equilibrium constant is usually divided by the quotient of activity coefficients, to become a quotient of concentrations. See {{slink|Equilibrium chemistry|Equilibrium constant}} for details. Moreover, the concentration of solvent is usually taken to be constant and so is also subsumed into the equilibrium constant. For these reasons, the constant for a solubility equilibrium has dimensions related to the scale on which concentrations are measured. Solubility constants defined in terms of concentrations are not only temperature-dependent, but also may depend on solvent composition when the solvent contains also species other than those derived from the solute.\n\n=== Phase effect ===\nEquilibria are defined for specific crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]]. Therefore, the solubility product is expected to be different depending on the phase of the solid. For example, [[aragonite]] and [[calcite]] have different solubility products even though they have both the same chemical identity ([[calcium carbonate]]). Under any given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable precipitate (e.g. aragonite), which is then said to be in a [[metastable]] state. \n\nIn pharmacology, the metastable state is sometimes referred to as amorphous state. Amorphous drugs have higher solubility than their crystalline counterparts due to the absence of long-distance interactions inherent in crystal lattice. Thus, it takes less energy to solvate the molecules in amorphous phase. [[In vivo supersaturation|The effect]] of amorphous phase on solubility is widely used to make drugs more soluble. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hsieh |first=Yi-Ling |last2=Ilevbare |first2=Grace A. |last3=Van Eerdenbrugh |first3=Bernard |last4=Box |first4=Karl J. |last5=Sanchez-Felix |first5=Manuel Vincente |last6=Taylor |first6=Lynne S. |date=2012-05-12 |title=pH-Induced Precipitation Behavior of Weakly Basic Compounds: Determination of Extent and Duration of Supersaturation Using Potentiometric Titration and Correlation to Solid State Properties |journal=Pharmaceutical Research |language=en |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=2738\u20132753 |doi=10.1007/s11095-012-0759-8 |pmid=22580905 |issn=0724-8741}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dengale |first=Swapnil Jayant |last2=Grohganz |first2=Holger |last3=Rades |first3=Thomas |last4=L\u00f6bmann |first4=Korbinian |date=May 2016 |title=Recent advances in co-amorphous drug formulations |journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews |volume=100 |pages=116\u2013125 |doi=10.1016/j.addr.2015.12.009 |pmid=26805787 |issn=0169-409X}}</ref>\n\n=== Particle-size effect ===\nThe thermodynamic solubility constant is defined for large monocrystals. Solubility increases with decreasing size of solute particle (or droplet) because of the additional surface energy. This effect is generally small, unless particles become very small, typically smaller than 1&nbsp;\u03bcm. The effect of the particle size on solubility constant can be quantified as follows:\n\n: <math>\\log(^*K_A) = \\log(^*K_{A \\to 0}) + \\frac{\\gamma A_\\text{m}}{3.454\\,RT},</math>\n\nwhere *''K<sub>A</sub>'' is the solubility constant for the solute particles with the molar surface area ''A'', *''K''<sub>''A''\u21920</sub> is the solubility constant for substance with molar surface area tending to zero (i.e., when the particles are large), ''\u03b3'' is the [[surface tension]] of the solute particle in the solvent, ''A''<sub>m</sub> is the molar surface area of the solute (in m<sup>2</sup>/mol), ''R'' is the [[universal gas constant]], and ''T'' is the [[absolute temperature]].<ref name=hefter>{{cite book |editor1-last=Hefter |editor1-first=G.

Section 2.14.</ref> ([[salting in]] and [[salting out]]) refers to the fact that the presence of a salt without [[common ion effect|ion in common]] with the solute has an effect on the [[ionic strength]] of the solution and hence on [[activity coefficient]]s, so that the equilibrium constant, expressed as a concentration quotient, changes.\n\n=== Temperature effect ===\n[[File:SolubilityVsTemperature.png|thumb|300px]]\n\nSolubility is sensitive to changes in [[temperature]]. For example, sugar is more soluble in hot water than cool water. It occurs because solubility constants, like other types of equilibrium constants, are functions of temperature. In accordance with [[Le Chatelier's principle]], when the dissolution process is [[endothermic reaction|endothermic]] (heat is absorbed), solubility increases with rising temperature. This effect is the basis for the process of [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]], which can be used to purify a chemical compound. When dissolution is [[exothermic]] (heat is released), solubility decreases with rising temperature.<ref name=\"pauling450\">{{cite book |author-link=Linus Pauling |last=Pauling |first= Linus |title=General Chemistry |publisher= Dover Publishing |date= 1970 |page=450}}</ref> \n[[Sodium sulfate]] shows increasing solubility with temperature below about 32.4&nbsp;\u00b0C, but a decreasing solubility at higher temperature.<ref>{{cite book |first = W.\u00a0F. |last = Linke |first2=A. |last2= Seidell |title = Solubilities of Inorganic and Metal Organic Compounds |edition = 4th |publisher = Van Nostrand |year = 1965 |isbn = 0-8412-0097-1}}</ref> This is because the solid phase is the decahydrate ({{Chem|Na|2|S|O|4|\u00b710H|2|O}}) below the transition temperature, but a different hydrate above that temperature.\n\nThe dependence on temperature of solubility for an ideal solution (achieved for low-solubility substances) is given by the following expression containing the enthalpy of melting \u0394<sub>m</sub>''H'' and mole fraction of the solute at saturation:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math> \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln x_i}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = \\frac{\\bar{H}_{i,\\text{aq}}-H_{i,\\text{cr}}}{RT^2},</math>\n|border colour = #50c878\n|background colour = #d5f6d2}}\n\nwhere <math>\\bar{H}_{i,\\text{aq}}</math> is the [[partial molar enthalpy]] of the solute at infinite dilution, and <math> H_{i,\\text{cr}}</math> is the enthalpy per mole of the pure crystal.<ref> [[Kenneth Denbigh]], ''The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'', 1957, p. 257.</ref>\n\nThis differential expression for a non-electrolyte can be integrated on a temperature interval to give<ref>[[Peter Atkins]], ''Physical Chemistry'', p. 153 (8th edition).</ref>:\n\n: <math>ln x_i = \\frac{\\Delta_\\text{m} H_i}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_f} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right).</math>\n\nFor nonideal solutions, activity of the solute at saturation appears instead of mole fraction solubility in the derivative w.r.t. temperature:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math> \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ln a_i}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = \\frac{H_{i,\\text{aq}}-H_{i,\\text{cr}}}{RT^2}.</math>\n|border colour = #50c878\n|background colour = #d5f6d2}}\n\n===Pressure effect===\nFor condensed phases (solids and liquids), the pressure dependence of solubility is typically weak and usually neglected in practice.

M. |last=Gutman |title=Mechanochemistry of Solid Surfaces |publisher=World Scientific Publishing |date=1994}}</ref>\n\nThe pressure dependence of solubility does occasionally have practical significance. For example, [[Fouling#Precipitation fouling|precipitation fouling]] of oil fields and wells by [[calcium sulfate]] (which decreases its solubility with decreasing pressure) can result in decreased productivity with time.\n\n==Simple dissolution==\nDissolution of an ''organic solid'' can be described as an equilibrium between the substance in its solid and dissolved forms. For example, when [[sucrose]] (table sugar) forms a saturated solution\n: C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(s) {{eqm}} C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(aq).\n\nAn equilibrium expression for this reaction can be written, as for any chemical reaction (products over reactants),\n\n: <math chem>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\{\\ce{C12H22O11(aq)}\\}}{\\{\\ce{C12H22O11(s)}\\}},</math>\n\nwhere <math>K^\\ominus</math> is called the thermodynamic solubility constant. The braces indicate [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]]. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, unity. Therefore\n\n: <math chem>K^\\ominus = \\{\\ce{C12H22O11(aq)}\\}.</math>\n\nThe activity of a substance A in solution can be expressed as the product of the concentration [A] and an [[activity coefficient]] ''\u03b3''. When <math>K^\\ominus</math> is divided by ''\u03b3'', the solubility constant\n\n: <math chem>K_\\text{s} = [\\ce{C12H22O11(aq)}]</math>\n\nis obtained. This is equivalent to defining the [[standard state]] as the saturated solution, so that the activity coefficient is equal to one. The solubility constant is a true constant only if the activity coefficient is not affected by any other solutes that may be present. The unit of the solubility constant is the same as the unit of the concentration of the solute. For [[sucrose]] ''K''&nbsp;= 1.971&nbsp;mol/L at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C. This shows that the solubility of sucrose at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C is nearly 2&nbsp;mol/L (540&nbsp;g/L). Sucrose is unusual in that it does not easily form a supersaturated solution at higher concentrations, as do most other [[carbohydrate]]s.\n\n==Dissolution with dissociation==\n''Ionic compounds'' normally [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into their constituent ions when they dissolve in water. For example, for [[silver chloride]]:\n\n: AgCl<sub>(s)</sub> {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>.\n\nThe expression for the equilibrium constant for this reaction is\n\n: <math chem>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\text{(aq)}\\} \\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\text{(aq)}\\}}{\\{\\ce{AgCl_{(s)}}\\}}\n= \\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\text{(aq)}\\} \\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\text{(aq)}\\},\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>K^\\ominus</math> is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, and braces indicate activity. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, equal to one.\n\nWhen the solubility of the salt is very low, the activity coefficients of the ions in solution are nearly equal to one. By setting them to be actually equal to one, this expression reduces to the '''solubility product''' expression:\n: <math chem>K_\\text{sp} = [\\ce{Ag+}][\\ce{Cl-}] = [\\ce{Ag+}]^2 = [\\ce{Cl-}]^2.</math>\n\nFor 2:2 and 3:3 salts, such as CaSO<sub>4</sub> and FePO<sub>4</sub>, the general expression for the solubility product is the same as for a 1:1 electrolyte:\n: AB {{eqm}} A<sup>''p''+</sup> + B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup>,\n: ''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A][B] = [A]<sup>2</sup> = [B]<sup>2</sup> (electrical charges are omitted in general expressions, for simplicity of notation).\n\nThe equilibrium expression for an unsymmetrical salt like CaCl<sub>2</sub> or Na<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>) is given by\n: A<sub>''p''</sub>B<sub>''q''</sub> {{eqm}} ''p''&nbsp;A<sup>''q''+</sup> + ''q''&nbsp;B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup>.\nA solute like Sn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is a 1:2 electrolyte like CaCl<sub>2</sub>, so a more complicated expression is needed for the solution equilibrium as the ionic charges are Sn<sup>4+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>. The solubility product, however, depends only on stoichiometry and is given by\n: ''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A]<sup>''p''</sup> [B]<sup>''q''</sup>.\nWhen the product dissociates the concentration of B is equal to ''q''/''p'' times the concentration of A:\n: [B] = {{sfrac|''q''|''p''}} [A].\nTherefore\n: <math chem>K_\\text{sp} = [\\ce{A}]^p \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q [\\ce{A}]^q = \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q [\\ce{A}]^{p+q},</math>\n: <math chem>[\\ce{A}] = \\sqrt[p+q]{\\frac{K_\\text{sp}}{\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q}}.</math>\nThe solubility ''S'' is {{sfrac|''p''}}[A]. One may incorporate {{sfrac|''p''}} and insert it under the root to obtain\n: <math chem>S = \\frac{[\\ce{A}]}{p} = \\frac{[\\ce{B}]}{q} = \\sqrt[p+q]{\\frac{K_\\text{sp}}{\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q p^{p+q}}}\n= \\sqrt[p+q]{\\frac{K_\\text{sp}}{q^q p^p}}.</math>\n: {| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Salt  ||p||q||Solubility, S \n|-\n!AgCl<br>Ca(SO<sub>4</sub>)<br>Fe(PO<sub>4</sub>)\n| 1|| 1|| {{math|1={{sqrt|''K''<sub>sp</sub>}}}}\n|-\n!Na<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<br>Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n| 2<br>1|| 1<br>2|| <math chem>\\sqrt[3]{K_\\ce{sp}\\over4}</math>\n|-\n!Na<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<br>FeCl<sub>3</sub>\n|3<br>1|| 1<br>3 || <math chem>\\sqrt[4]{K_\\ce{sp}\\over27}</math>\n|-\n!Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub><br>Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n|3<br>2 ||2<br>3|| <math chem>\\sqrt[5]{K_\\ce{sp}\\over 108}</math>\n|}\nSolubility products are often expressed in logarithmic form.

The smaller the value, or the more negative the log value, the lower the solubility.\n\nSome salts are not fully dissociated in solution.

For example, the solubility of [[silver chloride]], AgCl, is lowered when sodium chloride, a source of the common ion chloride, is added to a suspension of AgCl in water.<ref>{{Housecroft3rd}} Section 6.10.</ref>\n: AgCl(s) {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq); {{spaces|5}}''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [Ag<sup>+</sup>][Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]\nThe solubility, ''S'', in the absence of a common ion can be calculated as follows. The concentrations [Ag<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>] are equal because one mole of AgCl dissociates into one mole of Ag<sup>+</sup> and one mole of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>. Let the concentration of [Ag<sup>+</sup>](aq) be denoted by ''x''.\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''<sup>2</sup>;{{spaces|5}} ''S'' = ''x'' = {{sqrt|''K''<sub>sp</sub>}}\n''K''<sub>sp</sub> for AgCl is equal to {{val|1.77|e=-10|u=mol<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22126</sup>}} at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, so the solubility is {{val|1.33|e=-5|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}}.\n\nNow suppose that sodium chloride is also present, at a concentration of 0.01&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup>. The solubility, ignoring any possible effect of the sodium ions, is now calculated by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''(0.01 + ''x'')\nThis is a quadratic equation in ''x'', which is also equal to the solubility. \n:''x''<sup>2</sup> + 0.01''x'' \u2212 ''K''<sub>sp</sub> = 0\nIn the case of silver chloride ''x''<sup>2</sup> is very much smaller than 0.01''x'', so this term can be ignored. Therefore\n:''S'' = ''x'' = {{sfrac|''K''<sub>sp</sub>|0.01}} = {{val|1.77|e=-8|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}},\na considerable reduction. In [[gravimetric analysis]] for silver, the reduction in solubility due to the common ion effect is used to ensure \"complete\" precipitation of AgCl.\n\n== Dissolution with reaction ==\n[[File:Silver Chloride dissolution.png|thumb|180px| When a concentrated solution of ammonia is added to a suspension of silver chloride dissolution occurs because a complex of Ag<sup>+</sup> is formed]]\nA typical reaction with dissolution involves a [[weak base]], B, dissolving in an acidic aqueous solution.\n: B(s) + H<sup>+</sup> (aq) {{eqm}} BH<sup>+</sup> (aq)\nThis reaction is very important for pharmaceutical products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/potential-solubility-drug-discovery-and-development |title=Potential Of Solubility In Drug Discovery And development |last=Payghan |first=Santosh |year=2008 |publisher=Pharminfo.net |accessdate=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330171700/http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/potential-solubility-drug-discovery-and-development |archivedate=March 30, 2010 }}</ref> Dissolution of weak acids in alkaline media is similarly important. \n:H<sub>''n''</sub>A(s) + OH<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) {{eqm}} H<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>A<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThe uncharged molecule usually has lower solubility than the ionic form, so solubility depends on pH and the [[acid dissociation constant]] of the solute. The term \"intrinsic solubility\" is used to describe the solubility of the un-ionized form in the absence of acid or alkali.\n\nLeaching of aluminium salts from rocks and soil by [[acid rain]] is another example of dissolution with reaction: [[alumino-silicate]]s are bases which react with the acid to form soluble species, such as Al<sup>3+</sup>(aq).\n\nFormation of a chemical [[Complex (chemistry)|complex]] may also change solubility.

This is because both precipitation and dissolution reactions may be extremely slow. If the process is very slow solvent evaporation may be an issue. Supersaturation may occur. With very insoluble substances, the concentrations in solution are very low and difficult to determine. The methods used fall broadly into two categories, static and dynamic.\n\n=== Static methods ===\nIn static methods a mixture is brought to equilibrium and the concentration of a species in the solution phase is determined by [[chemical analysis]]. This usually requires separation of the solid and solution phases. In order to do this the equilibration and separation should be performed in a thermostatted room.<ref>{{cite book|first1=F. J.

The solubility measured for such a mixture is known as \"kinetic solubility\". The cloudiness is due to the fact that the precipitate particles are very small resulting in [[Tyndall scattering]]. In fact the particles are so small that the [[#Particle size effect|particle size effect]] comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium solubility. Over time the cloudiness will disappear as the size of the crystallites increases, and eventually equilibrium will be reached in a process known as precipitate ageing.<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}} Chapter 11: Gravimetric analysis</ref>\n\n=== Dynamic methods ===\nSolubility values of organic acids, bases, and ampholytes of pharmaceutical interest may be obtained by a process called \"Chasing equilibrium solubility\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stuart|first=M.|last2=Box|first2=K. |year=2005|title=Chasing Equilibrium: Measuring the Intrinsic Solubility of Weak Acids and Bases|journal=Anal.

The advantage of this method is that it is relatively fast as the quantity of precipitate formed is quite small.

The solid may dissolve unchanged, with dissociation or with chemical reaction with another constituent of the solvent, such as acid or alkali. Each type of equilibrium is characterized by a temperature-dependent [[equilibrium constant]]. Solubility equilibria are important in pharmaceutical, environmental and many other scenarios.\n\n== Definitions ==\nA solubility equilibrium exists when a [[chemical compound]] in the solid state is in [[chemical equilibrium]] with a [[solution]] of that compound. The equilibrium is an example of [[dynamic equilibrium]] in that some individual molecules migrate between the solid and solution phases such that the rates of [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] are equal to one another. When equilibrium is established, the solution is said to be saturated. The [[concentration]] of the solute in a saturated solution is known as the [[solubility]]. Units of solubility may be molar (mol/[[litre|L]]) or expressed as mass per unit volume, such as \u03bcg/ml. Solubility is temperature-dependent. A solution containing a higher concentration of solute than the solubility is said to be [[supersaturation|supersaturated]]. A supersaturated solution may be induced to come to equilibrium by the addition of a \"seed\", which may be a tiny crystal of the solute or a tiny solid particle, which initiates precipitation.\n\nThere are three main types of solubility equilibria:\n# Simple dissolution.\n# Dissolution with dissociation reaction. This is characteristic of [[salts]]. The equilibrium constant is known in this case as a solubility product.\n# Dissolution with ionization reaction. This is characteristic of the dissolution of [[weak acid]]s or [[weak base]]s in aqueous media of varying [[pH]].\n\nIn each case an [[equilibrium constant]] can be specified as a quotient of [[activity (chemistry)|activities]]. This equilibrium constant is [[dimensionless]] as activity is a dimensionless quantity. However, use of activities is very inconvenient, so the equilibrium constant is usually divided by the quotient of activity coefficients, to become a quotient of concentrations. See {{slink|Equilibrium chemistry|Equilibrium constant}} for details. Moreover, the concentration of solvent is usually taken to be constant and so is also subsumed into the equilibrium constant. For these reasons, the constant for a solubility equilibrium has dimensions related to the scale on which concentrations are measured. Solubility constants defined in terms of concentrations are not only temperature-dependent, but also may depend on solvent composition when the solvent contains also species other than those derived from the solute.\n\n=== Phase effect ===\nEquilibria are defined for specific crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]]. Therefore, the solubility product is expected to be different depending on the phase of the solid. For example, [[aragonite]] and [[calcite]] have different solubility products even though they have both the same chemical identity ([[calcium carbonate]]). Under any given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable precipitate (e.g. aragonite), which is then said to be in a [[metastable]] state. \n\nIn pharmacology, the metastable state is sometimes referred to as amorphous state. Amorphous drugs have higher solubility than their crystalline counterparts due to the absence of long-distance interactions inherent in crystal lattice. Thus, it takes less energy to solvate the molecules in amorphous phase. [[In vivo supersaturation|The effect]] of amorphous phase on solubility is widely used to make drugs more soluble. <ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hsieh |first=Yi-Ling |last2=Ilevbare |first2=Grace A. |last3=Van Eerdenbrugh |first3=Bernard |last4=Box |first4=Karl J. |last5=Sanchez-Felix |first5=Manuel Vincente |last6=Taylor |first6=Lynne S. |date=2012-05-12 |title=pH-Induced Precipitation Behavior of Weakly Basic Compounds: Determination of Extent and Duration of Supersaturation Using Potentiometric Titration and Correlation to Solid State Properties |journal=Pharmaceutical Research |language=en |volume=29 |issue=10 |pages=2738\u20132753 |doi=10.1007/s11095-012-0759-8 |pmid=22580905 |issn=0724-8741}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dengale |first=Swapnil Jayant |last2=Grohganz |first2=Holger |last3=Rades |first3=Thomas |last4=L\u00f6bmann |first4=Korbinian |date=May 2016 |title=Recent advances in co-amorphous drug formulations |journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews |volume=100 |pages=116\u2013125 |doi=10.1016/j.addr.2015.12.009 |pmid=26805787 |issn=0169-409X}}</ref>\n\n=== Particle-size effect ===\nThe thermodynamic solubility constant is defined for large monocrystals. Solubility increases with decreasing size of solute particle (or droplet) because of the additional surface energy.

M. |last=Gutman |title=Mechanochemistry of Solid Surfaces |publisher=World Scientific Publishing |date=1994}}</ref>\n\nThe pressure dependence of solubility does occasionally have practical significance. For example, [[Fouling#Precipitation fouling|precipitation fouling]] of oil fields and wells by [[calcium sulfate]] (which decreases its solubility with decreasing pressure) can result in decreased productivity with time.\n\n==Simple dissolution==\nDissolution of an ''organic solid'' can be described as an equilibrium between the substance in its solid and dissolved forms. For example, when [[sucrose]] (table sugar) forms a saturated solution\n: C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(s) {{eqm}} C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>(aq).\n\nAn equilibrium expression for this reaction can be written, as for any chemical reaction (products over reactants),\n\n: <math chem>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\{\\ce{C12H22O11(aq)}\\}}{\\{\\ce{C12H22O11(s)}\\}},</math>\n\nwhere <math>K^\\ominus</math> is called the thermodynamic solubility constant. The braces indicate [[Activity (chemistry)|activity]]. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, unity. Therefore\n\n: <math chem>K^\\ominus = \\{\\ce{C12H22O11(aq)}\\}.</math>\n\nThe activity of a substance A in solution can be expressed as the product of the concentration [A] and an [[activity coefficient]] ''\u03b3''. When <math>K^\\ominus</math> is divided by ''\u03b3'', the solubility constant\n\n: <math chem>K_\\text{s} = [\\ce{C12H22O11(aq)}]</math>\n\nis obtained. This is equivalent to defining the [[standard state]] as the saturated solution, so that the activity coefficient is equal to one. The solubility constant is a true constant only if the activity coefficient is not affected by any other solutes that may be present. The unit of the solubility constant is the same as the unit of the concentration of the solute. For [[sucrose]] ''K''&nbsp;= 1.971&nbsp;mol/L at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C. This shows that the solubility of sucrose at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C is nearly 2&nbsp;mol/L (540&nbsp;g/L). Sucrose is unusual in that it does not easily form a supersaturated solution at higher concentrations, as do most other [[carbohydrate]]s.\n\n==Dissolution with dissociation==\n'''Ionic compounds''' normally [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociate]] into their constituent ions when they dissolve in water. For example, for [[silver chloride]]:\n\n:AgCl<sub>(s)</sub> {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nThe expression for the equilibrium constant for this reaction is:\n\n:<math chem>K^\\ominus = \\frac{\\left\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}}{ \\left\\{\\ce{AgCl_{(s)}}\\right\\}}\n=\\left\\{\\ce{Ag+}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\\left\\{\\ce{Cl-}_\\ce{(aq)}\\right\\}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>K^\\ominus</math> is the thermodynamic equilibrium constant and braces indicate activity. The activity of a pure solid is, by definition, equal to one.\n\nWhen the solubility of the salt is very low the activity coefficients of the ions in solution are nearly equal to one. By setting them to be actually equal to one this expression reduces to the '''solubility product''' expression:\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{sp} = [\\ce{Ag+}][\\ce{Cl-}]= [\\ce{Ag+}]^2= [\\ce{Cl-}]^2.\\,</math>\n\nFor 2:2 and 3:3 salts, such as CaSO<sub>4</sub> and FePO<sub>4</sub>, the general expression for the solubility product is the same as for a 1:1 electrolyte\n:AB {{eqm}} A<sup>''p''+</sup> + B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup>\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A][B] = [A]<sup>2</sup> = [B]<sup>2</sup> (electrical charges are omitted in general expressions, for simplicity of notation)\n\nThe equilibrium expression for an unsymmetrical salt like CaCl<sub>2</sub> or Na<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>) is given by\n:A<sub>''p''</sub>B<sub>''q''</sub> {{eqm}} ''p''&nbsp;A<sup>''q''+</sup> + ''q''&nbsp;B<sup>''p''\u2212</sup> \nA solute like Sn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> is a 1:2 electrolyte like CaCl<sub>2</sub>, so a more complicated expression is needed for the solution equilibrium as the ionic charges are Sn<sup>4+</sup> and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. The solubility product, however, depends only on stoichiometry and is given by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [A]<sup>''p''</sup>[B]<sup>''q''</sup>\nWhen the product dissociates the concentration of B is equal to ''{{sfrac|q|p}}'' times the concentration of A. \n:[B] = ''{{sfrac|q|p}}''[A]\nTherefore\n:<math chem>K_\\ce{sp} = [\\ce{A}]^p \\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q [\\ce{A}]^q =\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q[\\ce{A}]^{p+q}</math>\n:<math chem>[\\ce{A}] = \\sqrt[p+q]{K_\\ce{sp} \\over {\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q}}</math>\nThe solubility, ''S'' is {{sfrac|''p''}}[A]. One may incorporate {{sfrac|''p''}} and insert it under the root to obtain\n:<math chem>S = {[\\ce{A}] \\over p} = {[\\ce{B}] \\over q} = \\sqrt[p+q]{K_\\ce{sp} \\over {\\left(\\frac{q}{p}\\right)^q} p^{p+q}}\n= \\sqrt[p+q]{K_\\ce{sp} \\over {q^q} p^p}</math>\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Salt  ||p||q||Solubility, S \n|-\n!AgCl<br>Ca(SO<sub>4</sub>)<br>Fe(PO<sub>4</sub>)\n| 1|| 1|| {{math|1={{sqrt|''K''<sub>sp</sub>}}}}\n|-\n!Na<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<br>Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>\n| 2<br>1|| 1<br>2|| <math chem>\\sqrt[3]{K_\\ce{sp}\\over4}</math>\n|-\n!Na<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<br>FeCl<sub>3</sub>\n|3<br>1|| 1<br>3 || <math chem>\\sqrt[4]{K_\\ce{sp}\\over27}</math>\n|-\n!Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub><br>Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>\n|3<br>2 ||2<br>3|| <math chem>\\sqrt[5]{K_\\ce{sp}\\over 108}</math>\n|}\nSolubility products are often expressed in logarithmic form. Thus, for calcium sulfate, {{math|1=''K''<sub>sp</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;{{val|4.93|e=-5}}}}, {{math|1=log&nbsp;''K''<sub>sp</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u22124.32}}. The smaller the value, or the more negative the log value, the lower the solubility.\n\nSome salts are not fully dissociated in solution. Examples include [[magnesium sulfate|MgSO<sub>4</sub>]], famously discovered by [[Manfred Eigen]] to be present in [[seawater]] as both an [[inner sphere complex]] and an [[ion association|outer sphere complex]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1967/eigen-lecture.pdf |first=Manfred |last=Eigen|author-link=Manfred Eigen |title=Nobel lecture|date=1967|website=Nobel Prize}}</ref> The solubility of such salts is calculated by the method outlined in [[#Dissolution with reaction|dissolution with reaction]].\n\n=== Hydroxides ===\nFor hydroxides solubility products are often given in a modified form, ''K''*<sub>sp</sub>, using hydrogen ion concentration in place of hydroxide ion concentration.<ref name=\"bm\">{{cite book|last=Baes |first1=C.

For example, the solubility of [[silver chloride]], AgCl, is lowered when sodium chloride, a source of the common ion chloride, is added to a suspension of AgCl in water.<ref>{{Housecroft3rd}} Section 6.10.</ref>\n: AgCl(s) {{eqm}} Ag<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq); {{spaces|5}}''K''<sub>sp</sub> = [Ag<sup>+</sup>][Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>]\nThe solubility, ''S'', in the absence of a common ion can be calculated as follows. The concentrations [Ag<sup>+</sup>] and [Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>] are equal because one mole of AgCl dissociates into one mole of Ag<sup>+</sup> and one mole of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>. Let the concentration of [Ag<sup>+</sup>](aq) be denoted by ''x''.\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''<sup>2</sup>;{{spaces|5}} ''S'' = ''x'' = {{sqrt|''K''<sub>sp</sub>}}\n''K''<sub>sp</sub> for AgCl is equal to {{val|1.77|e=-10|u=mol<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22126</sup>}} at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C, so the solubility is {{val|1.33|e=-5|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}}.\n\nNow suppose that sodium chloride is also present, at a concentration of 0.01&nbsp;mol dm<sup>\u22123</sup>. The solubility, ignoring any possible effect of the sodium ions, is now calculated by\n:''K''<sub>sp</sub> = ''x''(0.01 + ''x'')\nThis is a quadratic equation in ''x'', which is also equal to the solubility. \n:''x''<sup>2</sup> + 0.01''x'' \u2212 ''K''<sub>sp</sub> = 0\nIn the case of silver chloride ''x''<sup>2</sup> is very much smaller than 0.01''x'', so this term can be ignored. Therefore\n:''S'' = ''x'' = {{sfrac|''K''<sub>sp</sub>|0.01}} = {{val|1.77|e=-8|u=mol&nbsp;dm<sup>\u22123</sup>}},\na considerable reduction. In [[gravimetric analysis]] for silver, the reduction in solubility due to the common ion effect is used to ensure \"complete\" precipitation of AgCl.\n\n== Dissolution with reaction ==\n[[File:Silver Chloride dissolution.png|thumb|180px| When a concentrated solution of ammonia is added to a suspension of silver chloride dissolution occurs because a complex of Ag<sup>+</sup> is formed]]\nA typical reaction with dissolution involves a [[weak base]], B, dissolving in an acidic aqueous solution.\n: B(s) + H<sup>+</sup> (aq) {{eqm}} BH<sup>+</sup> (aq)\nThis reaction is very important for pharmaceutical products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/potential-solubility-drug-discovery-and-development |title=Potential Of Solubility In Drug Discovery And development |last=Payghan |first=Santosh |year=2008 |publisher=Pharminfo.net |accessdate=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330171700/http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/potential-solubility-drug-discovery-and-development |archivedate=March 30, 2010 }}</ref> Dissolution of weak acids in alkaline media is similarly important. \n:H<sub>''n''</sub>A(s) + OH<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) {{eqm}} H<sub>''n''\u22121</sub>A<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThe uncharged molecule usually has lower solubility than the ionic form, so solubility depends on pH and the [[acid dissociation constant]] of the solute. The term \"intrinsic solubility\" is used to describe the solubility of the un-ionized form in the absence of acid or alkali.\n\nLeaching of aluminium salts from rocks and soil by [[acid rain]] is another example of dissolution with reaction: [[alumino-silicate]]s are bases which react with the acid to form soluble species, such as Al<sup>3+</sup>(aq).\n\nFormation of a chemical [[Complex (chemistry)|complex]] may also change solubility. A well-known example, is the addition of a concentrated solution of [[ammonia]] to a suspension of [[silver chloride]], in which dissolution is favoured by the formation of an ammine complex.\n:AgCl(s) + 2&nbsp;NH<sub>3</sub>(aq) {{eqm}} [Ag(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>+</sup>(aq) + Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq)\nAnother example involves the addition of [[water softener]]s to washing powders to inhibit the precipitation of salts of magnesium and calcium ions, which are present in [[hard water]], by forming complexes with them.\n\nThe calculation of solubility in these cases requires two or more simultaneous equilibria to be considered. For example,\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Intrinsic solubility equilibrium\n| B(s) {{eqm}} B(aq)\n| ''K''<sub>s</sub> = [B(aq)] \n|-\n!Acid\u2013base equilibrium\n| B(aq) + H<sup>+</sup>(aq) {{eqm}} BH<sup>+</sup>(aq)\n| ''K''<sub>a</sub> = [B(aq)][H<sup>+</sup>(aq)]/[BH<sup>+</sup>(aq)] \n|}\n\n== Experimental determination ==\nThe determination of solubility is fraught with difficulties.<ref name=hefter/> First and foremost is the difficulty in establishing that the system is in equilibrium at the chosen temperature. This is because both precipitation and dissolution reactions may be extremely slow. If the process is very slow solvent evaporation may be an issue. Supersaturation may occur. With very insoluble substances, the concentrations in solution are very low and difficult to determine. The methods used fall broadly into two categories, static and dynamic.\n\n=== Static methods ===\nIn static methods a mixture is brought to equilibrium and the concentration of a species in the solution phase is determined by [[chemical analysis]]. This usually requires separation of the solid and solution phases. In order to do this the equilibration and separation should be performed in a thermostatted room.<ref>{{cite book|first1=F. J. C. |last1=Rossotti |first2=H. |last2=Rossotti |title=The Determination of Stability Constants |publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1961 |chapter=Chapter 9: Solubility}}</ref> Very low concentrations can be measured if a [[radioactive]] tracer is incorporated in the solid phase.\n\nA variation of the static method is to add a solution of the substance in a non-aqueous solvent, such as [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], to an aqueous [[Buffer solution|buffer]] mixture.\n<ref>Aqueous solubility measurement \u2013 kinetic vs. thermodynamic methods {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711083258/http://www.moleculardevices.com/pdfs/pIon.pdf |date=July 11, 2009 }}</ref> Immediate precipitation may occur giving a cloudy mixture. The solubility measured for such a mixture is known as \"kinetic solubility\". The cloudiness is due to the fact that the precipitate particles are very small resulting in [[Tyndall scattering]]. In fact the particles are so small that the [[#Particle size effect|particle size effect]] comes into play and kinetic solubility is often greater than equilibrium solubility. Over time the cloudiness will disappear as the size of the crystallites increases, and eventually equilibrium will be reached in a process known as precipitate ageing.<ref>{{VogelQuantitative}} Chapter 11: Gravimetric analysis</ref>\n\n=== Dynamic methods ===\nSolubility values of organic acids, bases, and ampholytes of pharmaceutical interest may be obtained by a process called \"Chasing equilibrium solubility\".<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stuart|first=M.|last2=Box|first2=K. |year=2005|title=Chasing Equilibrium: Measuring the Intrinsic Solubility of Weak Acids and Bases|journal=Anal.

Subsequently, the rate of change of pH due to precipitation or dissolution is monitored and strong acid and base titrant are added to adjust the pH to discover the equilibrium conditions when the two rates are equal. The advantage of this method is that it is relatively fast as the quantity of precipitate formed is quite small. However, the performance of the method may be affected by the formation supersaturated solutions.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Solubility table]]: A table of solubilities of mostly inorganic salts at temperatures between 0 and 100&nbsp;\u00b0C.\n* [[Molar solubility]]: The number of moles of a substance (the solute) that can be dissolved per liter of solution before the solution becomes saturated.\n* [[Solvent models]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Housecroft3rd}} Section 6.9: Solubilities of ionic salts.

It is the territory's financial centre and a major port and [[tourist destination]]. Its population of 854 (2016)<ref>{{cite web |title=2016 Population and Housing Census Report |url=https://www.gov.bm/sites/default/files/2016%20Census%20Report.pdf |publisher=Government of Bermuda, Department of Statistics |accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref> is one of the smallest of any capital cities.\n\n==History==\n\nThe history of Hamilton as a British city began in 1790 when the government of Bermuda set aside {{convert|145|acre|ha}} for its future seat, officially incorporated in 1793 by an Act of Parliament, and named for [[Governor of Bermuda|Governor]] [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Henry Hamilton]]. The colony's capital relocated to Hamilton from [[St. George's, Bermuda|St George's]] in 1815. The city has been at the political and military heart of Bermuda ever since. Government buildings include the parliament building, the Government House to the north, the former Admiralty House of the [[Royal Navy]] to the west (both in Pembroke), and the [[British Army]] [[Bermuda Garrison|garrison]] headquarters at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda|Prospect Camp]] to its east.\n\nThe Town of Hamilton became a city in 1897, ahead of the consecration in 1911 of the [[Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Bermuda|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity]] (Church of England), which was under construction at the time. A Catholic cathedral, [[Cathedral of Saint Theresa of Lisieux|St. Theresa's]], was later constructed. Today, the city overlooking Hamilton Harbour is primarily a business district, with few structures other than office buildings and shops. The City of Hamilton has long maintained a building height and view limit, which states that no buildings may obscure the Cathedral. In the 21st century, buildings have been planned and some are under construction that are as high as ten storeys in the area. Bermuda's local newspaper, ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]],'' reports, \"If you don't recognise the city, from 15 years ago, we don't blame you as it has changed so much\".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:West_end_of_Hamilton_Warf.jpg|West end of Hamilton Wharf, 1857\nFile:Government_House,_Mount_Langton.jpg|Old [[Government House, Bermuda|Government House]], Mount Langton, 1857\nFile:039 Pitt's Bay, n\u00e4ra Hamilton.jpg|Pitt's Bay, 1895\nFile:City Hall in Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|City Hall in Hamilton\nFile:Cathedral in Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|The [[Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Bermuda|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity]] in Hamilton.\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nHamilton is located on the north side of [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], and is Bermuda's main port. Although there is a parish of the [[Hamilton Parish, Bermuda|same name]], the city of Hamilton is in the parish of [[Pembroke Parish, Bermuda|Pembroke]]. The city is named after [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Sir Henry Hamilton]], governor of the territory from 1786 to 1793. Hamilton Parish antedates the city.\n\nThe administrative capital of Bermuda, Hamilton, has a limited permanent population around 854 (2016); however in 2010, 13,340 (40% of Bermuda's working population) worked here on a daily basis. The only incorporated city in Bermuda, Hamilton is smaller than the historic town of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]]. A more representative measure of Bermuda's local residential populations tends to be by parish.\n\n==Economy==\nAs the offshore domicile of many foreign companies, Bermuda has a highly developed international business economy; it is an exporter of financial services, primarily insurance, reinsurance, investment funds, and [[Special purpose entity|special-purpose vehicles]]. Finance and international business constitute the largest sector of Bermuda's economy, and virtually all of this business takes place within the borders of Hamilton.\n\nNumerous leading international insurance companies are based in Hamilton, as it is a global [https://www.oil.bm/ reinsurance centrel]. Around 400 internationally owned and operated businesses are physically based in Bermuda, and many are represented by the Association of Bermuda International Companies. In total, over 1,500 exempted or international companies are currently registered with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda.\n\nThe city is the registered headquarters of the spirits manufacturer [[Bacardi]], semiconductor manufacturer [[Marvell Technology]], outsourcing company [[Genpact]], telecommunications company [[Global Crossing]], and reinsurance company [[Tokio Millennium Re Ltd]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Bermuda Move Allows Insurers To Avoid Taxes |date= 6 March 2000 |author= David Cay Johnston and Joseph B.

This shield is supported by a mermaid and heraldic sea horse (i.e., demi-horse, demi-fish), and is placed on a mount in front of which is a scroll containing the motto \"Sparsa Collegit\". The shield is topped by a crest featuring a closed helm topped with a torque above which an heraldic seahorse is emerging from the sea holding a flower.<ref name=\"FOTW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/bm-hm-hm.html|title=City of Hamilton (Bermuda)|work=crwflags.com}}</ref> The city's full motto is  ''Hamilton sparsa collegit'', (\"Hamilton has assembled the scattered\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/seecity.htm|title=Bermuda's City of Hamilton|work=bermuda-online.org}}</ref>\n\nThe city's flag is a [[banner of arms]], featuring the same details as on the shield of the city's coat of arms, but with the flowers in white rather than gold.<ref name=\"FOTW\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Parks==\nThe city of Hamilton has many parks for its size. Probably the most notable park in the city is Victoria Park. This park occupies a whole block and was named after [[Queen Victoria]]. Other parks in the city are Par La Ville Park, Barr's Park, All Buoy's Point Park, and the hidden Cedar Park.\n\n{{wide image|Hamilton, Bermuda 1911b.jpg|950px|Panorama of Hamilton, 1911. View from Fort Hamilton.}}\n{{wide image|Hamilton, Bermuda Panorama.jpg|950px|Panorama of Hamilton, 2007. Same vantage.}}\n\n==Climate==\nAlthough located some distance north of the geographic tropics, Hamilton has a warm trade-wind [[tropical rainforest climate]] bordering on [[humid subtropical climate]]. It is warm enough for coconut palms and other tropical palms to grow, although they may not fruit properly due to the lack of heat or sunshine during the winter months because of latitude. Hamilton has uncharacteristically warm temperatures for its latitude (32\u00b0N) because of the moderating influence of the North Atlantic and nearby [[Gulf Stream]]. Hamilton features warm and humid summers and semi-warm \"winters\". As temperatures are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean, it rarely gets very hot or cold in the city. Precipitation is plentiful throughout the year and Hamilton does not have a [[dry season]] month, a month where on average less than {{convert|60|mm|2|abbr=on}} of precipitation falls. Summer precipitation is usually from showers, thunderstorms, and tropical disturbances or even [[tropical cyclones]]. Meanwhile, winter precipitation is typically derived from westerly moving extra-tropical cyclones and their associated fronts. Erratic, extended dry spells occasionally develop because of variations in the semi-permanent sub-tropical ridge locally known as the [[Bermuda-Azores High]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Hamilton, Bermuda ([[L.F.

The Argo Cup brings the world's best match-racing sailors (including world champions and Olympic sailors) to Bermuda for five days of one-on-one 'match racing'. Points accrued during the event contribute to the World Match Racing Tour and ultimately a chance to race in the final event, the [[Monsoon Cup]] in Malaysia. The winner of that is crowned ISAF World Match Racing Champion. Unlike many water-based sports, which occur too far out to view from shore, 'match racing' is a great spectator sport. The race takes place only 15m from the shore, and spectators can see the heart of the action.\n\nThe history of the modern Bermuda Gold Cup event dates back to the very beginning of the match racing style of sailing. The first '[[match race]]' in a one-design racing yacht, i.e. technically identical boats, was the [[King Edward VII Gold Cup]]<ref>[http://www.bermudagoldcup.com/content/view/3/5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519080149/http://www.bermudagoldcup.com/content/view/3/5|date=19 May 2010}}</ref> in Bermuda (now known as the Argo Gold Cup) that was first sailed in 1937. The Argo Gold Cup is still a key event in the World Match Racing Tour calendar.\n\nThe King Edward VII Cup itself was originally given at the Tri-Centenary Regatta at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1907, by [[King Edward VII]] in commemoration of the 300th Anniversary of the first permanent settlement in America. C. Sherman Hoyt won that regatta, and was the first sailor to accept the historic trophy.\n\nHoyt held the Gold Cup for three decades before donating it to the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]] and proposing an annual one-on-one match-race series in 6-Meter yachts. In his letter he expressed the propriety of \"my returning a British Royal trophy to the custody of your club, with its long record of clean sportsmanship and keenly contested races between your Bermuda yachts and ours of Long Island Sound, and elsewhere...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sailingnetworks.com/events/details/8398 |title=2009 Bermuda Gold Cup (King Edward VII Gold Cup) \u2013 Oct 2009 \u2013 The Calendar on Sailing Networks |publisher=Sailingnetworks.com |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref> The first winner of the Cup in its new format was [[Briggs Cunningham]] in 1937.

Government buildings include the parliament building, the Government House to the north, the former Admiralty House of the [[Royal Navy]] to the west (both in Pembroke), and the [[British Army]] [[Bermuda Garrison|garrison]] headquarters at [[Prospect Camp, Bermuda|Prospect Camp]] to its east.\n\nThe Town of Hamilton became a city in 1897, ahead of the consecration in 1911 of the [[Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Bermuda|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity]] (Church of England), which was under construction at the time. A Catholic cathedral, [[Cathedral of Saint Theresa of Lisieux|St. Theresa's]], was later constructed. Today, the city overlooking Hamilton Harbour is primarily a business district, with few structures other than office buildings and shops. The City of Hamilton has long maintained a building height and view limit, which states that no buildings may obscure the Cathedral. In the 21st century, buildings have been planned and some are under construction that are as high as ten storeys in the area. Bermuda's local newspaper, ''[[The Royal Gazette (Bermuda)|The Royal Gazette]],'' reports, \"If you don't recognise the city, from 15 years ago, we don't blame you as it has changed so much\".{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:West_end_of_Hamilton_Warf.jpg|West end of Hamilton Wharf, 1857\nFile:Government_House,_Mount_Langton.jpg|Old [[Government House, Bermuda|Government House]], Mount Langton, 1857\nFile:039 Pitt's Bay, n\u00e4ra Hamilton.jpg|Pitt's Bay, 1895\nFile:City Hall in Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|City Hall in Hamilton\nFile:Cathedral in Hamilton, Bermuda.jpg|The [[Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity, Bermuda|Cathedral of the Most Holy Trinity]] in Hamilton.\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nHamilton is located on the north side of [[Hamilton Harbour, Bermuda|Hamilton Harbour]], and is Bermuda's main port. Although there is a parish of the [[Hamilton Parish, Bermuda|same name]], the city of Hamilton is in the parish of [[Pembroke Parish, Bermuda|Pembroke]]. The city is named after [[Henry Hamilton (governor)|Sir Henry Hamilton]], governor of the territory from 1786 to 1793. Hamilton Parish antedates the city.\n\nThe administrative capital of Bermuda, Hamilton, has a limited permanent population around 854 (2016); however in 2010, 13,340 (40% of Bermuda's working population) worked here on a daily basis. The only incorporated city in Bermuda, Hamilton is smaller than the historic town of [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's]]. A more representative measure of Bermuda's local residential populations tends to be by parish.\n\n==Economy==\nAs the offshore domicile of many foreign companies, Bermuda has a highly developed international business economy; it is an exporter of financial services, primarily insurance, reinsurance, investment funds, and [[Special purpose entity|special-purpose vehicles]]. Finance and international business constitute the largest sector of Bermuda's economy, and virtually all of this business takes place within the borders of Hamilton.\n\nNumerous leading international insurance companies are based in Hamilton, as it is a global reinsurance centre{{Clarify|reason=|date=May 2018}}. Around 400 internationally owned and operated businesses are physically based in Bermuda, and many are represented by the Association of Bermuda International Companies. In total, over 1,500 exempted or international companies are currently registered with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda.\n\nThe city is the registered headquarters of the spirits manufacturer [[Bacardi]], semiconductor manufacturer [[Marvell Technology]], outsourcing company [[Genpact]], telecommunications company [[Global Crossing]], and reinsurance company [[Tokio Millennium Re Ltd]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=Bermuda Move Allows Insurers To Avoid Taxes |date= 6 March 2000 |author= David Cay Johnston and Joseph B.

This shield is supported by a mermaid and heraldic sea horse (i.e., demi-horse, demi-fish), and is placed on a mount in front of which is a scroll containing the motto \"Sparsa Collegit\". The shield is topped by a crest featuring a closed helm topped with a torque above which an heraldic seahorse is emerging from the sea holding a flower.<ref name=\"FOTW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/bm-hm-hm.html|title=City of Hamilton (Bermuda)|work=crwflags.com}}</ref> The city's full motto is  ''Hamilton sparsa collegit'', (\"Hamilton has assembled the scattered\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bermuda-online.org/seecity.htm|title=Bermuda's City of Hamilton|work=bermuda-online.org}}</ref>\n\nThe city's flag is a [[banner of arms]], featuring the same details as on the shield of the city's coat of arms, but with the flowers in white rather than gold.<ref name=\"FOTW\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Parks==\nThe city of Hamilton has many parks for its size. Probably the most notable park in the city is Victoria Park. This park occupies a whole block and was named after [[Queen Victoria]]. Other parks in the city are Par La Ville Park, Barr's Park, All Buoy's Point Park, and the hidden Cedar Park.\n\n{{wide image|Hamilton, Bermuda 1911b.jpg|950px|Panorama of Hamilton, 1911. View from Fort Hamilton.}}\n{{wide image|Hamilton, Bermuda Panorama.jpg|950px|Panorama of Hamilton, 2007. Same vantage.}}\n\n==Climate==\nAlthough located some distance north of the geographic tropics, Hamilton has a warm trade-wind [[tropical rainforest climate]] bordering on [[humid subtropical climate]]. It is warm enough for coconut palms and other tropical palms to grow, although they may not fruit properly due to the lack of heat or sunshine during the winter months because of latitude. Hamilton has uncharacteristically warm temperatures for its latitude (32\u00b0N) because of the moderating influence of the North Atlantic and nearby [[Gulf Stream]]. Hamilton features warm and humid summers and semi-warm \"winters\". As temperatures are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean, it rarely gets very hot or cold in the city. Precipitation is plentiful throughout the year and Hamilton does not have a [[dry season]] month, a month where on average less than {{convert|60|mm|2|abbr=on}} of precipitation falls. Summer precipitation is usually from showers, thunderstorms, and tropical disturbances or even [[tropical cyclones]]. Meanwhile, winter precipitation is typically derived from westerly moving extra-tropical cyclones and their associated fronts. Erratic, extended dry spells occasionally develop because of variations in the semi-permanent sub-tropical ridge locally known as the [[Bermuda-Azores High]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Hamilton, Bermuda ([[L.F.

The Argo Cup brings the world's best match-racing sailors (including world champions and Olympic sailors) to Bermuda for five days of one-on-one 'match racing'. Points accrued during the event contribute to the World Match Racing Tour and ultimately a chance to race in the final event, the [[Monsoon Cup]] in Malaysia. The winner of that is crowned ISAF World Match Racing Champion. Unlike many water-based sports, which occur too far out to view from shore, 'match racing' is a great spectator sport. The race takes place only 15m from the shore, and spectators can see the heart of the action.\n\nThe history of the modern Bermuda Gold Cup event dates back to the very beginning of the match racing style of sailing. The first '[[match race]]' in a one-design racing yacht, i.e. technically identical boats, was the [[King Edward VII Gold Cup]]<ref>[http://www.bermudagoldcup.com/content/view/3/5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519080149/http://www.bermudagoldcup.com/content/view/3/5|date=19 May 2010}}</ref> in Bermuda (now known as the Argo Gold Cup) that was first sailed in 1937.

C. Sherman Hoyt won that regatta, and was the first sailor to accept the historic trophy.\n\nHoyt held the Gold Cup for three decades before donating it to the [[Royal Bermuda Yacht Club]] and proposing an annual one-on-one match-race series in 6-Meter yachts.

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 French children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in Belgium, and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets. While each news outlet has its own ranking system, in all the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently figures among the top ten in France. \n\nClassement des lyc\u00e9es 2019:\n\n* [https://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr Le Figaro]\n* [https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-lycees.html L'Etudiant]\n* [https://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/ L'Express]\n* [http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/annuaire-lycees/classement/lycees-gt.html Le Parisien]\n* [http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-international/etablissement-0783549J L'Internaute]\n\n\nEvery year many Lyc\u00e9e International students present the prestigious [[Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]].

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. All other disciplines of the official program are taught in French, by French Ministry of Education teachers.\n\n*[https://www.americansection.org American Section] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:There are some 700 students enrolled in the American Section, at three different campuses, ranging from Pre-K (''MS'') through twelfth grade (''Terminale''). Over 50 nationalities are represented in the American Section student body, though the majority of our students hold both French and American nationalities or are French citizens who spent considerable time abroad in English language schools. The common denominator is that all American Section students speak age-appropriate fluent English and are motivated to learn in a demanding bilingual and bicultural environment.\n:The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens. It pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools. Approximately 65 students in grades K-5 (CP-CM2) attend the Ecole Schnapper, and 160 students in grades 6-9 (6\u00e8me-3\u00e8me) the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby.

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the {{Interlanguage link multi|Ch\u00e2teau d'Hennemont|fr}} to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]]. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 French children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the [[Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales]] and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, [[Ren\u00e9 Tallard]], retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected M Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in Belgium, and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, [[Edgar Scherer]]. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, [[Jean Pierre Maillard|Jean-Pierre Maillard]], had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to [[Patrick Charpeil]], who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\n[[Yves Lemaire]] took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets. While each news outlet has its own ranking system, in all the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently figures among the top ten in France. \n\nClassement des lyc\u00e9es 2019:\n\n* [https://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr Le Figaro]\n* [https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-lycees.html L'Etudiant]\n* [https://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/ L'Express]\n* [http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/annuaire-lycees/classement/lycees-gt.html Le Parisien]\n* [http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-international/etablissement-0783549J L'Internaute]\n\n\nEvery year many Lyc\u00e9e International students present the prestigious [[Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]].

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. All other disciplines of the official program are taught in French, by French Ministry of Education teachers.\n\n*[https://www.americansection.org American Section] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:There are some 700 students enrolled in the American Section, at three different campuses, ranging from Pre-K (''MS'') through twelfth grade (''Terminale''). Over 50 nationalities are represented in the American Section student body, though the majority of our students hold both French and American nationalities or are French citizens who spent considerable time abroad in English language schools. The common denominator is that all American Section students speak age-appropriate fluent English and are motivated to learn in a demanding bilingual and bicultural environment.\n:The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens. It pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools. Approximately 65 students in grades K-5 (CP-CM2) attend the Ecole Schnapper, and 160 students in grades 6-9 (6\u00e8me-3\u00e8me) the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby.

The series aired in Japan between January 10 and March 28, 2013. The anime has been licensed in North America by [[Sentai Filmworks]]. A film sequel, ''Tamako Love Story'', premiered in Japan on April 26, 2014, paired with a short film titled ''Dera-chan of the Southern Islands''.\n\n==Plot==\nTamako Kitashirakawa is the eldest daughter of a family which runs the Tama-ya [[mochi]] shop in the {{nihongo|Usagiyama Shopping District|\u3046\u3055\u304e\u5c71\u5546\u5e97\u8857|Usagiyama Sh\u014dtengai}}. One day, Tamako encounters a strange talking bird named Dera Mochimazzi who comes from a distant land searching for a bride for his country's prince. After becoming overweight from eating too much mochi, Dera ends up becoming a freeloader in Tamako's home. The series follows the everyday life of Tamako, her friends, family and neighbors, and this peculiar bird. As well as keeping track to the main course of events, ''Tamako Market'' and the following ''Tamako Love Story'' film cover the emotional lives of the characters, particularly Tamako's childhood friend Mochiz\u014d's crush on her and both of them being too shy to open up to each other.watch this and seven deadly sins!\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Tamako Kitashirakawa|\u5317\u767d\u5ddd \u305f\u307e\u3053|Kitashirakawa Tamako}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aya Suzaki]]|[[Margaret McDonald (voice actor)|Margaret McDonald]]}}<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/news/official-tamako-market-english-dub-cast-list|title=Official Tamako Market English Dub Cast List|work=Sentai Filmworks|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}</ref>\n:The [[titular character]] and the [[main protagonist]] of the series, Tamako is a first-year in high school whose family runs a [[mochi]] shop in their town's shopping district called Tama-ya. She enjoys her high school life and the baton club with her friends Kanna and Midori. She helps her family run the shop and invent new kinds of mochi. Her birthday is on [[New Year's Eve]] and is often forgotten due to the busy schedule, but Tamako devotes herself to helping in the shop. Tamako is nervous about public speaking and has problems swimming in addition to being somehow clumsy. Tamako is shown to be rather slow in catching up with things, particularly regarding people's feelings. She is one of the few characters that does not know Mochiz\u014d has a crush on her, and she fails to pick up on her sister's crush. Tamako feeds Dera mochi on a regular basis, and she feeds him too much for his size, making him bloated and unable to fly properly.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mochiz\u014d \u014cji|\u5927\u8def \u3082\u3061\u8535|\u014cji Mochiz\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Atsushi Tamaru]]|[[Clint Bickham]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Mochiz\u014d is Tamako's childhood friend whose family also runs a mochi shop called \u014cji-ya or in the new name Ricecake Oh!Zee, a mochi shop located across from Tama-ya. Though their fathers are not on good terms due to business competition, he and Tamako are good friends. He is in love with Tamako, and has been in love with her for a few years. Since their bedroom windows face each other, Mochizo and Tamako often talk via a \"cup and string\" system that he made when they were kids. He is shown to be nervous with public speaking, despite telling Tamako to let him take over speaking in the shopping district meeting. His name comes from the fact that he was born on Mochi Day (October 10).\n\n;{{Nihongo|Dera Mochimazzi|\u30c7\u30e9\u30fb\u30e2\u30c1\u30de\u30c3\u30c5\u30a3}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takumi Yamazaki]]|[[Jay Hickman (actor)|Jay Hickman]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Dera is a bird that speaks Japanese, with a little bossy tone, that ends up staying at Tamako's house. He is a noble attendant for a royal court from a tropical island and was on journey to find a bride for its prince. However, after gaining an affinity for mochi, he has put on a lot of weight and thus cannot fly properly anymore, only being able to manage short distances before he runs out of breath. He is often just referred to as {{Nihongo|\"Bird\"|\u9ce5|Tori}} by Tamako's family, or simply {{Nihongo|\"Dera-chan\"|\u30c7\u30e9\u3061\u3083\u3093}} by Tamako, as his surname sounds very similar to {{nihongo3|lit. \"bad tasting mochi\"|\u3082\u3061\u307e\u305a\u3044|mochi mazui}}. Dera maintains that he is rather versed in the ways of love, sometimes giving Mochiz\u014d and Midori love advice on their respective crushes on Tamako. Dera is rather full of himself as well, which usually stems from a series of misunderstandings. He believes anyone that sneezes in his direction is in love with him, he himself having a crush on Shiori. His body contains a communication system used by the prince to communicate with him, although it only works when Dera is unconscious, thus he has no memories of any time the prince attempts to contact him. In his unconscious state, he can also be hooked up to video devices and used like a projector.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Midori Tokiwa|\u5e38\u76e4 \u307f\u3069\u308a|Tokiwa Midori}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaneko]]|[[Juliet Simmons]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Midori is Tamako's classmate and childhood friend, as well as captain of her school's Baton Club, which Tamako and Kanna are also members of. Her grandparents own and run a toy shop in the town's shopping district called Tokiwa-do. Midori loves and cares about Tamako so much that she gradually begins to think more and more about the nature of her feelings as romantic love. This ambiguity only intensifies towards the end of the series, when the plot begins to imply her equality to Mochizo in terms of attachment to Tamako.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kanna Makino|\u7267\u91ce \u304b\u3093\u306a|Makino Kanna}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Juri Nagatsuma]]|[[Caitlynn French]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Kanna is a high school student in the same year as her friends, Tamako and Midori, and is a member of the baton club. She is the daughter of a carpenter who works in the same shopping district as Tamako and her family. A relaxed and laid back girl, Kanna does not care what anyone else thinks and is not easily swayed, however she does have a fear of heights and appears to have an allergy of birds. Kanna is often portrayed as rather eccentric, and usually wears a straight and expressionless face despite being fun and a good friend. Kanna is the only character who knows about Midori\u2019s potential feelings for Tamako, which she comments on with the words \u201ceveryone can love who they wants\u201d.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shiori Asagiri|\u671d\u9727 \u53f2\u7e54|Asagiri Shiori}}\n:{{voiced by|Yurie Yamashita|Krystal LaPorte (TV); Francis Caorrots (movie)}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Shiori is one of Tamako's classmates and a member of the badminton club. She is a knowledgeable and resourceful girl, with a serious, cool personality. However, it is shown that while she is quiet and often mistaken as distant, she is actually extremely shy and later becomes good friends with Tamako. Dera has fallen for her, though she does not reciprocate his feelings.\n\n===Kitashirakawa family===\n;{{Nihongo|Anko Kitashirakawa|\u5317\u767d\u5ddd \u3042\u3093\u3053|Kitashirakawa Anko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Rina Hidaka]]|[[Brittney Karbowski]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Anko is Tamako's younger sister, who is in fourth grade. She is less practical than her older sister, and is a more fashion conscious girl. She often demands that she be called just \"An\", as she feels \"Anko\" is too childish. She is named after [[red bean paste]].\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mamedai Kitashirakawa|\u5317\u767d\u5ddd \u8c46\u5927|Kitashirakawa Mamedai}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Keiji Fujiwara]]|[[David Wald]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Mamedai is Tamako's father, who runs the family's mochi shop. He has a rivalry with Gohei \u014cji, and they are often seen in front of their shops arguing, to which Tamako and Mochiz\u014d have to resolve. Tamako's father is a traditionalist, and does not care much for special mochi. He often mocks the sign of Gohei's shop, Ricecake Oh!Zee, commenting that it is ridiculous.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Fuku Kitashirakawa|\u5317\u767d\u5ddd \u798f|Kitashirakawa Fuku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tomomichi Nishimura]]|Carl Masterson}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Fuku is Mamedai's father and Tamako's grandfather, who lives with her family and helps run the mochi shop. He is rather laid back and lenient, especially towards Tamako and Anko, in contrast towards his son, who is much harsher on his two daughters. His and Mamedai's names together are a reference to [[daifuku|mame daifuku]].\n\n;{{nihongo|Hinako Kitashirakawa|\u5317\u767d\u5ddd \u3072\u306a\u3053|Kitashirakawa Hinako}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|[[Nancy Novotny]] (TV); [[Rozie Curtis]] (movie)}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Hinako is Mamedai's wife and Tamako and Anko's mother.

While Tamako's father sees Mochiz\u014d as a spy whenever he enters his shop, Gohei is on friendly terms with Tamako, as they both greet each other normally whenever they meet. Tamako does not think that his shop's name is ridiculous, and she praises his new sign above the shop when it is installed. Gohei is highly inventive with his mochi, taking advantage of non-Japanese holidays such as Valentine's Day in order to make different types of special mochi. This is one of the main arguments he has with Tamako's father.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Michiko \u014cji|\u5927\u8def \u9053\u5b50|\u014cji Michiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satsuki Yukino]]|Molly Searcy}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Michiko is Mochiz\u014d's mother, who helps run the \u014cji-ya shop.

One day, Tamako encounters a strange talking bird named Dera Mochimazzi who comes from a distant land searching for a bride for his country's prince. After becoming overweight from eating too much mochi, Dera ends up becoming a freeloader in Tamako's home. The series follows the everyday life of Tamako, her friends, family and neighbors, and this peculiar bird. As well as keeping track to the main course of events, ''Tamako Market'' and the following ''Tamako Love Story'' film cover the emotional lives of the characters, particularly Tamako's childhood friend Mochiz\u014d's crush on her and both of them being too shy to open up to each other.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n;{{Nihongo|Tamako Kitashirakawa|\u5317\u767d\u5ddd \u305f\u307e\u3053|Kitashirakawa Tamako}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aya Suzaki]]|[[Margaret McDonald (voice actor)|Margaret McDonald]]}}<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.sentaifilmworks.com/news/official-tamako-market-english-dub-cast-list|title=Official Tamako Market English Dub Cast List|work=Sentai Filmworks|accessdate=November 15, 2018}}</ref>\n:The [[titular character]] and the [[main protagonist]] of the series, Tamako is a first-year in high school whose family runs a [[mochi]] shop in their town's shopping district called Tama-ya. She enjoys her high school life and the baton club with her friends Kanna and Midori. She helps her family run the shop and invent new kinds of mochi. Her birthday is on [[New Year's Eve]] and is often forgotten due to the busy schedule, but Tamako devotes herself to helping in the shop. Tamako is nervous about public speaking and has problems swimming in addition to being somehow clumsy. Tamako is shown to be rather slow in catching up with things, particularly regarding people's feelings. She is one of the few characters that does not know Mochiz\u014d has a crush on her, and she fails to pick up on her sister's crush. Tamako feeds Dera mochi on a regular basis, and she feeds him too much for his size, making him bloated and unable to fly properly.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mochiz\u014d \u014cji|\u5927\u8def \u3082\u3061\u8535|\u014cji Mochiz\u014d}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Atsushi Tamaru]]|[[Clint Bickham]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Mochiz\u014d is Tamako's childhood friend whose family also runs a mochi shop called \u014cji-ya or in the new name Ricecake Oh!Zee, a mochi shop located across from Tama-ya. Though their fathers are not on good terms due to business competition, he and Tamako are good friends. He is in love with Tamako, and has been in love with her for a few years. Since their bedroom windows face each other, Mochizo and Tamako often talk via a \"cup and string\" system that he made when they were kids. He is shown to be nervous with public speaking, despite telling Tamako to let him take over speaking in the shopping district meeting. His name comes from the fact that he was born on Mochi Day (October 10).\n\n;{{Nihongo|Dera Mochimazzi|\u30c7\u30e9\u30fb\u30e2\u30c1\u30de\u30c3\u30c5\u30a3}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Takumi Yamazaki]]|[[Jay Hickman (actor)|Jay Hickman]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Dera is a bird that speaks Japanese, with a little bossy tone, that ends up staying at Tamako's house. He is a noble attendant for a royal court from a tropical island and was on journey to find a bride for its prince. However, after gaining an affinity for mochi, he has put on a lot of weight and thus cannot fly properly anymore, only being able to manage short distances before he runs out of breath. He is often just referred to as {{Nihongo|\"Bird\"|\u9ce5|Tori}} by Tamako's family, or simply {{Nihongo|\"Dera-chan\"|\u30c7\u30e9\u3061\u3083\u3093}} by Tamako, as his surname sounds very similar to {{nihongo3|lit. \"bad tasting mochi\"|\u3082\u3061\u307e\u305a\u3044|mochi mazui}}. Dera maintains that he is rather versed in the ways of love, sometimes giving Mochiz\u014d and Midori love advice on their respective crushes on Tamako. Dera is rather full of himself as well, which usually stems from a series of misunderstandings. He believes anyone that sneezes in his direction is in love with him, he himself having a crush on Shiori. His body contains a communication system used by the prince to communicate with him, although it only works when Dera is unconscious, thus he has no memories of any time the prince attempts to contact him. In his unconscious state, he can also be hooked up to video devices and used like a projector.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Midori Tokiwa|\u5e38\u76e4 \u307f\u3069\u308a|Tokiwa Midori}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Y\u016bki Kaneko]]|[[Juliet Simmons]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Midori is Tamako's classmate and childhood friend, as well as captain of her school's Baton Club, which Tamako and Kanna are also members of. Her grandparents own and run a toy shop in the town's shopping district called Tokiwa-do. Midori loves and cares about Tamako so much that she gradually begins to think more and more about the nature of her feelings as romantic love. This ambiguity only intensifies towards the end of the series, when the plot begins to imply her equality to Mochizo in terms of attachment to Tamako.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Kanna Makino|\u7267\u91ce \u304b\u3093\u306a|Makino Kanna}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Juri Nagatsuma]]|[[Caitlynn French]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Kanna is a high school student in the same year as her friends, Tamako and Midori, and is a member of the baton club. She is the daughter of a carpenter who works in the same shopping district as Tamako and her family. A relaxed and laid back girl, Kanna does not care what anyone else thinks and is not easily swayed, however she does have a fear of heights and appears to have an allergy of birds. Kanna is often portrayed as rather eccentric, and usually wears a straight and expressionless face despite being fun and a good friend. Kanna is the only character who knows about Midori\u2019s potential feelings for Tamako, which she comments on with the words \u201ceveryone can love who they wants\u201d.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Shiori Asagiri|\u671d\u9727 \u53f2\u7e54|Asagiri Shiori}}\n:{{voiced by|Yurie Yamashita|Krystal LaPorte (TV); Francis Caorrots (movie)}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Shiori is one of Tamako's classmates and a member of the badminton club. She is a knowledgeable and resourceful girl, with a serious, cool personality. However, it is shown that while she is quiet and often mistaken as distant, she is actually extremely shy and later becomes good friends with Tamako. Dera has fallen for her, though she does not reciprocate his feelings.\n\n===Kitashirakawa family===\n;{{Nihongo|Anko Kitashirakawa|\u5317\u767d\u5ddd \u3042\u3093\u3053|Kitashirakawa Anko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Rina Hidaka]]|[[Brittney Karbowski]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Anko is Tamako's younger sister, who is in fourth grade. She is less practical than her older sister, and is a more fashion conscious girl. She often demands that she be called just \"An\", as she feels \"Anko\" is too childish. She is named after [[red bean paste]].\n\n;{{Nihongo|Mamedai Kitashirakawa|\u5317\u767d\u5ddd \u8c46\u5927|Kitashirakawa Mamedai}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Keiji Fujiwara]]|[[David Wald]]}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Mamedai is Tamako's father, who runs the family's mochi shop. He has a rivalry with Gohei \u014cji, and they are often seen in front of their shops arguing, to which Tamako and Mochiz\u014d have to resolve. Tamako's father is a traditionalist, and does not care much for special mochi. He often mocks the sign of Gohei's shop, Ricecake Oh!Zee, commenting that it is ridiculous.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Fuku Kitashirakawa|\u5317\u767d\u5ddd \u798f|Kitashirakawa Fuku}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Tomomichi Nishimura]]|Carl Masterson}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Fuku is Mamedai's father and Tamako's grandfather, who lives with her family and helps run the mochi shop. He is rather laid back and lenient, especially towards Tamako and Anko, in contrast towards his son, who is much harsher on his two daughters. His and Mamedai's names together are a reference to [[daifuku|mame daifuku]].\n\n;{{nihongo|Hinako Kitashirakawa|\u5317\u767d\u5ddd \u3072\u306a\u3053|Kitashirakawa Hinako}}\n:{{animevoices|[[Y\u014dko Hikasa]]|[[Nancy Novotny]] (TV); [[Rozie Curtis]] (movie)}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Hinako is Mamedai's wife and Tamako and Anko's mother.

While Tamako's father sees Mochiz\u014d as a spy whenever he enters his shop, Gohei is on friendly terms with Tamako, as they both greet each other normally whenever they meet. Tamako does not think that his shop's name is ridiculous, and she praises his new sign above the shop when it is installed. Gohei is highly inventive with his mochi, taking advantage of non-Japanese holidays such as Valentine's Day in order to make different types of special mochi. This is one of the main arguments he has with Tamako's father.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Michiko \u014cji|\u5927\u8def \u9053\u5b50|\u014cji Michiko}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Satsuki Yukino]]|Molly Searcy}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n:Michiko is Mochiz\u014d's mother, who helps run the \u014cji-ya shop.

He was the first director of the [[United States Geological Survey]] from 1879 to 1881. King was noted for his exploration of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range.\n\n==Early life and education==\nClarence King was the son of James Rivers King and Florence Little King. Clarence's father was part of a family firm engaged in trade with China, which kept him away from home a great deal, and he died in 1848, so Clarence was brought up primarily by his mother. By 1848, his only two siblings had also died.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nClarence developed an early interest in outdoor exploration and natural history, which was encouraged by his mother and by Reverend Dr. Roswell Park, head of the Christ Church Hall school in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]], that Clarence attended until he was ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/pan-am/exposition/health/rpbiog.html|title=Biography of Dr. Roswell Park|publisher=University of Buffalo|accessdate=2014-07-05}}</ref> He then attended schools in Boston and New Haven and, at age thirteen, was accepted to the prestigious Hartford High School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hartfordpublic.com/schoolhistory.htm|title=School History|publisher=Hartford Public High School|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328043442/http://www.hartfordpublic.com/schoolhistory.htm|archivedate=2014-03-28}}</ref> He was a good student and a versatile athlete, of short stature but unusually strong.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=29\u201332}}\n\nHis mother received an income from the King family business until it met with a series of problems and dissolved in 1857. After a few years of straitened circumstances, during part of which Clarence suffered from a serious depression, his mother married George S. Howland in July 1860. Howland financed Clarence's enrollment in the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] affiliated with [[Yale College]] in 1860.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n== College life and early career ==\n[[File:Young Carence King.jpg|thumb|Clarence King as a young man]]\nAt Yale, King specialized in \"applied chemistry\" and also studied physics and geology. One inspiring teacher was [[James Dwight Dana]], a highly regarded geologist who had participated in a scientific expedition to the South Atlantic, South Pacific and the west coasts of South and North America. King graduated with a Ph.B. in July 1862. He and several friends borrowed one of Yale's rowboats that summer for a trip along the shores of [[Lake Champlain]] and a series of Canadian rivers, then returned to New Haven for the fall regatta.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=41\u201352}}\n\nIn October 1862, on a visit to the home of his former professor, [[George Jarvis Brush]], King heard Brush read aloud a letter he had received from [[William Henry Brewer]] telling of an ascent of [[Mount Shasta]] in California, then believed to be the tallest mountain in the United States. King began to read more about geology, attended a lecture by [[Louis Agassiz]], and soon wrote to Brush that he had \"pretty much made up my mind to be a geologist if I can get work in that direction\".{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=53\u201354}} He was also fascinated by descriptions of the Alps by [[John Tyndall]] and [[John Ruskin]].\n\nIn late 1862 or early 1863, King moved to New York City to share an apartment with [[James Terry Gardiner]], a close friend from high school and college (who spelled his last name Gardner at the time). They associated with a group of American artists, writers and architects who were admirers of Ruskin. In February 1863, King became one of the founders, along with [[John William Hill]], [[Clarence Cook]] and others, of the Ruskinian Association for the Advancement of Truth in Art, an American group similar to the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], and was elected its first secretary. But he was anxious to see the mountains of the American West, and his friend Gardiner was miserable in law school.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=57\u201360}}<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Shi\n  |first = David\n  |title = Facing facts: realism in American thought and culture, 1850\u20131920\n  |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  |year = 1996\n  |isbn=978-0-19-510653-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/DLDecArts.NewPathv1n01|title=The new path|volume=I|number=1|journal=Society for the Advancement of Truth in Art|date=May 1863}}</ref>\n\nBy May 1863, King, Gardiner and an acquaintance named William Hyde traveled by railroad to Missouri and then joined a [[wagon train]], which they left at [[Carson City, Nevada]].{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=61\u201371}} King and Gardiner soon continued on to California, where King joined the [[California Geological Survey]] without pay, in which he worked with [[William Henry Brewer|William H. Brewer]], [[Josiah Whitney|Josiah D. Whitney]] and later Gardiner and [[Richard D. Cotter]]. In July 1864, King and Cotter made the first ascent of a peak in the Eastern Sierra that King named [[Mount Tyndall]] in honor of one of his heroes. From there they discovered several higher peaks, including the one that came to be named [[Mount Whitney]].{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=119\u2013127}}\n\nIn September 1864, upon the designation by President Abraham Lincoln of the [[Yosemite Valley]] area as a permanent public reserve, King and Gardiner were appointed to make a boundary survey around the rim of Yosemite Valley. They returned to the East Coast by way of Nicaragua the following winter. King suffered from several bouts of malaria in spring and summer 1865 while Whitney, also in the East, worked on securing funding for further survey projects. King, Gardiner, Whitney and Whitney's wife sailed back to San Francisco in the fall, where Whitney lined up a survey project for King and Gardiner in the [[Mojave Desert]] and Arizona under U.S. Army auspices. They returned to San Francisco in the spring, and King returned to Yosemite in summer 1866 to make more field notes for Whitney. When King heard of the death of his stepfather, he and Gardiner resigned from the Whitney survey and once again sailed to New York. They had been developing a plan for an independent survey of the Great Basin region for some time and, in late 1866, King went to Washington to secure funding from Congress for such a survey.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=149\u2013182}}\n\n== Fortieth Parallel Survey and diamond hoax discovery ==\n[[File:Clarence King, Salt Lake City, Utah Camp, ClarenceKingClear.jpg|thumb|Clarence King; Camp near [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. The exploration of the Survey of the Fortieth Parallel. Photo by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]], October 1868.]]\nKing made a persuasive argument for how his research would help develop the west. He received federal funding and was named U.S. Geologist of the [[Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel]], commonly known as the Fortieth Parallel Survey, in 1867. He persuaded Gardiner to be his second in command and they assembled a team that included, among others, [[Samuel Franklin Emmons]], [[Arnold Hague]], [[A. D. Wilson]], the photographer [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]] and guest artist [[Gilbert Munger]].\n\nOver the next six years, King and his team explored areas from eastern California to Wyoming. During that time he also published his famous ''Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada'' (1872).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/mountaineering_in_the_sierra_nevada/|first=Clarence|last=King|title=Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada|location=New York|publisher=C. Scribner and sons|edition=tenth|year=1902}}</ref> \nWhile King was finishing the 40th Parallel Survey, the western US was abuzz with news of a secret diamond deposit. King and some of his crew tracked down the secret location in northwest Colorado and exposed it as a fraud, now known as the [[Diamond hoax of 1872]].<ref>King, Clarence. 1872.

He was the first director of the [[United States Geological Survey]] from 1879 to 1881. King was noted for his exploration of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range.\n\n==Early life and education==\nClarence King was the son of James Rivers King and Florence Little King. Clarence's father was part of a family firm engaged in trade with China, which kept him away from home a great deal, and he died in 1848, so Clarence was brought up primarily by his mother. By 1848, his only two siblings had also died.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nClarence developed an early interest in outdoor exploration and natural history, which was encouraged by his mother and by Reverend Dr. Roswell Park, head of the Christ Church Hall school in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]], that Clarence attended until he was ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/pan-am/exposition/health/rpbiog.html|title=Biography of Dr. Roswell Park|publisher=University of Buffalo|accessdate=2014-07-05}}</ref> He then attended schools in Boston and New Haven and, at age thirteen, was accepted to the prestigious Hartford High School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hartfordpublic.com/schoolhistory.htm|title=School History|publisher=Hartford Public High School|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328043442/http://www.hartfordpublic.com/schoolhistory.htm|archivedate=2014-03-28}}</ref> He was a good student and a versatile athlete, of short stature but unusually strong.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=29\u201332}}\n\nHis mother received an income from the King family business until it met with a series of problems and dissolved in 1857. After a few years of straitened circumstances, during part of which Clarence suffered from a serious depression, his mother married George S. Howland in July 1860. Howland financed Clarence's enrollment in the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] affiliated with [[Yale College]] in 1860.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=35\u201338}}\n\n== College life and early career ==\n[[File:Young Carence King.jpg|thumb|Clarence King as a young man]]\nAt Yale, King specialized in \"applied chemistry\" and also studied physics and geology. One inspiring teacher was [[James Dwight Dana]], a highly regarded geologist who had participated in a scientific expedition to the South Atlantic, South Pacific and the west coasts of South and North America. King graduated with a Ph.B. in July 1862. He and several friends borrowed one of Yale's rowboats that summer for a trip along the shores of [[Lake Champlain]] and a series of Canadian rivers, then returned to New Haven for the fall regatta.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=41\u201352}}\n\nIn October 1862, on a visit to the home of his former professor, [[George Jarvis Brush]], King heard Brush read aloud a letter he had received from [[William Henry Brewer]] telling of an ascent of [[Mount Shasta]] in California, then believed to be the tallest mountain in the United States. King began to read more about geology, attended a lecture by [[Louis Agassiz]], and soon wrote to Brush that he had \"pretty much made up my mind to be a geologist if I can get work in that direction\".{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=53\u201354}} He was also fascinated by descriptions of the Alps by [[John Tyndall]] and [[John Ruskin]].\n\nIn late 1862 or early 1863, King moved to New York City to share an apartment with [[James Terry Gardiner]], a close friend from high school and college (who spelled his last name Gardner at the time). They associated with a group of American artists, writers and architects who were admirers of Ruskin. In February 1863, King became one of the founders, along with [[John William Hill]], [[Clarence Cook]] and others, of the Ruskinian Association for the Advancement of Truth in Art, an American group similar to the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], and was elected its first secretary. But he was anxious to see the mountains of the American West, and his friend Gardiner was miserable in law school.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=57\u201360}}<ref>{{cite book\n  |last = Shi\n  |first = David\n  |title = Facing facts: realism in American thought and culture, 1850\u20131920\n  |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n  |year = 1996\n  |isbn=978-0-19-510653-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://digital.library.wisc.edu/1711.dl/DLDecArts.NewPathv1n01|title=The new path|volume=I|number=1|journal=Society for the Advancement of Truth in Art|date=May 1863}}</ref>\n\nBy May 1863, King, Gardiner and an acquaintance named William Hyde traveled by railroad to Missouri and then joined a [[wagon train]], which they left at [[Carson City, Nevada]].{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=61\u201371}} King and Gardiner soon continued on to California, where King joined the [[California Geological Survey]] without pay, in which he worked with [[William Henry Brewer|William H. Brewer]], [[Josiah Whitney|Josiah D. Whitney]] and later Gardiner and [[Richard D. Cotter]]. In July 1864, King and Cotter made the first ascent of a peak in the Eastern Sierra that King named [[Mount Tyndall]] in honor of one of his heroes. From there they discovered several higher peaks, including the one that came to be named [[Mount Whitney]].{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=119\u2013127}}\n\nIn September 1864, upon the designation by President Abraham Lincoln of the [[Yosemite Valley]] area as a permanent public reserve, King and Gardiner were appointed to make a boundary survey around the rim of Yosemite Valley. They returned to the East Coast by way of Nicaragua the following winter. King suffered from several bouts of malaria in spring and summer 1865 while Whitney, also in the East, worked on securing funding for further survey projects. King, Gardiner, Whitney and Whitney's wife sailed back to San Francisco in the fall, where Whitney lined up a survey project for King and Gardiner in the [[Mojave Desert]] and Arizona under U.S. Army auspices. They returned to San Francisco in the spring, and King returned to Yosemite in summer 1866 to make more field notes for Whitney. When King heard of the death of his stepfather, he and Gardiner resigned from the Whitney survey and once again sailed to New York. They had been developing a plan for an independent survey of the Great Basin region for some time and, in late 1866, King went to Washington to secure funding from Congress for such a survey.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=149\u2013182}}\n\n== Fortieth Parallel Survey and diamond hoax discovery ==\n[[File:Clarence King, Salt Lake City, Utah Camp, ClarenceKingClear.jpg|thumb|Clarence King; Camp near [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. The exploration of the Survey of the Fortieth Parallel. Photo by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]], October 1868.]]\nKing made a persuasive argument for how his research would help develop the west. He received federal funding and was named U.S. Geologist of the [[Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel]], commonly known as the Fortieth Parallel Survey, in 1867. He persuaded Gardiner to be his second in command and they assembled a team that included, among others, [[Samuel Franklin Emmons]], [[Arnold Hague]], [[A. D. Wilson]], the photographer [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]] and guest artist [[Gilbert Munger]].\n\nOver the next six years, King and his team explored areas from eastern California to Wyoming.
