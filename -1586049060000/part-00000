Replanting and management of the oak forests was promoted at this time. There was a large-scale felling of oak trees at Ross Island in 1803, Glena in around 1804 and Tomies in 1805.

They are typically dominated by sessile oak, which favours the acidic soils of the sandstone mountains.<ref name=Oakwoods/> The woods have Annex I status in the [[Habitats Directive|EU Habitats Directive]] because of their diverse and rich flora, most notably their [[bryophyte]]s ([[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s).<ref name=Perrin/>\n\nThe oak woodlands typically have an [[understory]] of [[Ilex aquifolium|holly]] (''Ilex aquifolium''). [[Arbutus unedo|Strawberry trees]] (''Arbutus unedo'') are a notable part of these woods. There are also scattered [[Taxus baccata|yews]].<ref name=Media4452/> The [[field layer]] includes [[bilberry]] and [[woodrush]].<ref name=Oakwoods/> The herb layer is not rich in species.<ref name=Media3866/>\n\nBryophytes, [[lichen]]s and [[Hymenophyllaceae|filmy ferns]] (''Hymenophyllaceae''), thrive in the humid oceanic climate. Species with restricted Atlantic [[Species distribution|distributions]] grow in the woods.<ref name=Perrin/> The bryophytes in these woods are perhaps the best-developed Atlantic [[bryophyte]] community in Europe.<ref name=Media4452/> The remote Glaism na Marbh valley has a particularly rich flora of bryophytes, some of which are scarce or absent in other parts of the woods.<ref name=Sullivan/> Mosses, ferns and liverworts frequently occur as epiphytes, attached to the trunks and branches of oak trees.<ref name=Oakwoods/> Rare species growing in the woods include ''[[Cyclodictyon laetivirens]]'', ''[[Daltonia splachnoides]]'', ''[[Lejeunea flava]]'', ''[[Radula carringtonii]]'', and ''[[Sematophyllum demissum]]''.<ref name=Media3866/>\n\nBird species that reside in the oak woods include [[blue tit]], [[common chaffinch]], [[goldcrest]], [[European robin]], and [[wren]]. Mammals include [[badger]], fox, [[pine marten]], [[red deer]], [[sika deer]], and [[red squirrel]]. Insects include many species of the parasitic [[gall wasp]] and the [[purple hairstreak]] butterfly, whose caterpillar is entirely dependent upon oak trees.<ref name=Oakwoods/>\n\nThe introduced common rhododendron is a large threat to certain areas of the oak woods.<ref name=Oakwoods/> For example, it is widespread throughout Camillan Wood despite ongoing attempts to control it.<ref name=Perrin/>\n\n===Yew woodlands===\n[[File:Reenadinna Yew Wood1.jpg|thumb|right|Reenadinna yew wood]]\nThe [[Taxus baccata|yew]] woodland in the park is known as Reenadinna Wood.

Although some clearance has occurred reinvasion continues.<ref name=Kelly/>\n\n==Bogland==\nWhile the lower slopes of the mountains are dominated by [[sessile oak]] (''Quercus petraea''), above {{convert|200|m|ft}} the mountains are virtually treeless and are dominated by [[blanket bog]] and wet heath.<ref name=Power/> The bogs in the park mostly have a characteristic flora that includes [[Ericaceae|heather]] (''Calluna vulgaris''), [[bell heather]] (''Erica cinerea'') and [[western gorse]] (''Ulex gallii''), with occasional [[bilberry]] (''Vaccinium myrtillus''). Large-flowered [[butterwort]] (''Pinguicula grandiflora'') is common. The bogs also support a number of notable species, including mosses (''Sphagnum pulchrum'', ''S. fuscum'', ''S. platyphyllum'', ''S. strictum'', ''S. contortum'' and ''Calliergon stramineum''), liverworts (''Cladopodiella francisci'' and ''Calypogeia azurea'') and lichens (''Cladonia mediterranea'', ''C. macilenta'', ''C. rangiferina'', ''C. arbuscula'' and ''Cetraria islandica'').<ref name=Media4452/>\n\nThe remoteness of some of the upland areas aids the survival of Ireland's only remaining wild herd of native red deer.<ref name=KNPAbout/> The bogs are threatened by grazing, [[turbary]], burning and afforestation.<ref name=Media3866/>\n\n==Flora==\nA large number of plant and animal species of interest occur within the site, including most of the native Irish mammal species, several important fish species including [[Arctic char]], and a range of rare or scarce plant species.<ref name=Media4452/> Several of the animal and plant species in the park have a hiberno-lusitanean distribution, meaning that they only occur in southwest Ireland, northern Spain, and [[Portugal]].

These plant species are grouped within four main categories: arctic-alpine plants, Atlantic species, North American species and very rare species. Atlantic species are species which are otherwise found mostly in southern and south-western Europe, for example [[arbutus]], [[St Patrick's cabbage]] and [[greater butterwort]]. North American species include [[blue-eyed grass]] and [[pipewort]].<ref name=NPWS/>\n\n===Bryophytes===\nBryophytes (mosses and liverworts) flourish in the park, due partly to the area's mild oceanic climate. The park is internationally significant for bryophytes. Many of the bryophytes found in the park are not found anywhere else in Ireland.<ref name=Species/> Mosses, ferns such as filmy ferns, and liverworts grow luxuriantly. Many of them live as epiphytes, growing on the branches and trunks of trees.<ref name=NPWS/>\n\n===Other plant species===\nThe Killarney fern (''[[Trichomanes speciosum]]'') is probably the most rare plant species in the park. It is a [[filmy fern]] that grows in the [[splash zone]] of waterfalls and other damp places. Although it was once quite common, it was picked almost to extinction when pickers collected it to be sold to tourists. The few sites where this fern remain tend to be in isolated mountainous locations where pickers never found it.<ref name=Species/>\n\nAlthough the [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (''Arbutus unedo'') is relatively common in the park, it is one of Ireland's rarest native tree species and is found in very few locations outside Killarney. In the park it is found on cliff tops and the edges of the woodlands around the lake.<ref name=Species/>\n\nKillarney [[whitebeam]] (''Sorbus anglica'') is a shrub or small tree that grows on rocks close to lakeshores. It is found only in Killarney. The more common Irish whitebeam (''Sorbus hibernica'') is also found in the park.<ref name=Species/>\n\nThe [[greater butterwort]] (''Pinguicula grandiflora'') (also known as the Kerry violet) is a [[carnivorous plant]] found in bogs. It digests insects to supplement the poor supply of nutrients (especially nitrogen) available from the bog. Its purple flowers bloom in late May and early June.<ref name=Species/>\n\nIrish [[spurge]] (''Euphorbia hyberna'') is an Atlantic species that in Ireland is only found in the southwest. In the past the milky [[sap]] from its stem was used to cure warts. Fishermen used it to capture fish, utilising compounds in the sap that prevent fish gills from functioning properly and so suffocate the fish.<ref name=Species/>\n\nA number of rare species of myxomycete fungus have been recorded in the park. These are ''Collaria arcyrionema'', ''Craterium muscorum'', ''Cribraria microcarpa'' (the only known location in Ireland), ''C. rufa'', ''C. violacea'', ''Diderma chondrioderma'', ''D. lucidum'', ''D. ochraceum'', ''Fuligo muscorum'', and ''Licea marginata''.<ref name=Media3866/> The park has a highly diverse lichen flora.<ref name=Species/>\n\n==Fauna==\n\n===Mammals===\nMost mammals native to Ireland and long established introduced species are found in the park.<ref name=NPWS/> The [[bank vole]] was first identified in 1964 in northwest Kerry.

The [[red grouse]] and [[ring ouzel]] are on the [[IUCN Red List]] of species of high conservation concern (1\u20132 pairs each). The Greenland white-fronted goose, merlin, and peregrine are listed on Annex I of the [[Birds Directive|EU Birds Directive]].<ref name=Media4452/> Other noteworthy species found in the park are the [[chough]], [[nightjar]], and [[osprey]]. The osprey sometimes passes through the park as it migrates between northern Africa and [[Scandinavia]]. Historical accounts and place names suggest that the osprey bred in the area in the past. [[Golden eagle]]s once nested in the park, but were extirpated around 1900 as a result of disturbance, nest robbing, and persecution.<ref name=BirdLife/>\n\nThe most common bird species in upland areas are [[meadow pipit]]s, [[raven]]s and [[stonechat]]s.<ref name=NPWS/> Rare species are [[Merlin (bird)|merlins]] (up to five pairs) and [[peregrine falcon]]s (at least one pair).<ref name=Media3866/>\n\nChaffinches and robins are the most common species in the woodlands.<ref name=NPWS/> Other species that breed there include [[blackcap]]s and [[garden warbler]]s.

A small flock of [[White-fronted goose|Greenland white-fronted geese]] (''Anser albifrons flavirostris'') from the world population of approximately 12,000<ref name=NPWS/> migrates to winter on boglands<ref name=Media3866/> in the Killarney Valley within the park.<ref name=NPWS/> The numbers of this bird that stay in the park are currently low, at less than twenty individuals. This population is important because it is the most southerly in Ireland and one of the few remaining populations remaining that feed entirely on bogland,<ref name=Media3866/> and whose habitat almost entirely lies within a protected area.<ref name=Species/>\n\nOther wintering waterfowls are [[Eurasian coot|coot]], [[Great cormorant|cormorant]], [[Common goldeneye|goldeneye]], mallard, [[Common pochard|pochard]], [[Common teal|teal]], and [[tufted duck]]. Other species that live on the lakes are the [[black-headed gull]], [[little grebe]], and [[mute swan]].<ref name=Media4452/>\n\nSpecies that migrate from Africa in the summer include [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]]s, [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]], and [[Swift (bird)|swifts]]. Some species are vagrants that appear sporadically, for example when there is stormy weather or an unusually cold spell on the European continent.<ref name=BirdLife/>\n\nThe park is also the site for a project to reintroduce [[white-tailed eagle]]s, which began in 2007 with the release of fifteen birds. The project will last a number of years with many more eagles being released. The species had become extinct in Ireland in the 19th century after persecution from landowners. Fifteen chicks will then be brought in annually for the following five years.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0816/eagles.html RT\u00c9 News \u2013 Rare eagle reintroduced to Ireland \u2013 August 2007]</ref> Despite a poisoning incident in 2009, the program is continuing<ref>[http://www.glencarhouse.com/news/2009/04/see-the-white-tailed-eagle-in-kerry-ireland/ update on white tailed eagles April 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419014600/http://www.glencarhouse.com/news/2009/04/see-the-white-tailed-eagle-in-kerry-ireland/ |date=19 April 2009 }}</ref> and birds introduced to the area have now been tracked to Wicklow and Donegal.\n\n===Fish species===\nThe Lakes of Killarney contain many brown trout and an annual run of salmon.

They are extremely sensitive to environmental changes when they are as far south as Ireland, where they are at the southern edge of their species range. The greatest threats to their survival in Ireland are introduced fish species, eutrophication, acidification and climate change.

One of these is the park's proximity to Killarney town, one of Ireland's best known tourist destinations. Killarney has hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. Most of these visitors spend time in the park. Careful management is needed to ensure minimal conflict between conservation and recreation.<ref name=KNPAbout/>\n\nThe past introduction of several [[exotic species]] to the park is an additional human influence on the area. These species have damaged the natural ecosystems of Killarney. The most notable of these species are the common rhododendron (''Rhododendron ponticum''), which has infested large areas of the National Park, and sika deer, which overgraze the woodland floor and pose a potential threat to the genetic integrity of the native red deer. Both rhododendron and sika deer can have an adverse effect on the native flora by inhibiting regeneration. A more recent, accidental, introduction is the [[American mink]], which is now firmly established in the park alongside the native otter. Extinctions caused by humans include the [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus L.'') and the [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos L.'').<ref name=Heritage>{{cite web\n |last=D\u00fachas \n |authorlink=D\u00fachas \n |title=Cultural Heritage \n |url=http://homepage.eircom.net/%7Eknp/sites/index.htm#abb \n |accessdate=1 July 2007 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105247/http://homepage.eircom.net/~knp/sites/index.htm \n |archivedate= 7 February 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\nFires caused by human activity occur with some frequency in the park.

It has become [[Eutrophic lake|eutrophic]] as a result of [[phosphate]]s from agricultural and domestic [[Water pollution|pollution]] entering Lough Leane Reedbed, an important habitat on the edge of Lough Leane. This nutrient enrichment has caused several [[algal bloom]]s in recent years. The blooms have not yet had a severe effect on the lake's ecosystem. To prevent further pollution causing a permanent change in the lake's ecosystem, a review of land use in the [[drainage basin|catchment]] area is being carried out.<ref name=Lakes/> [[Water quality]] in the lake appears to have improved since phosphates were removed from sewage in 1985.<ref name=Media3866/> As of August 2007, several large hotels and businesses have stated their intention to stop using phosphate detergents, in an effort to preserve the quality of the lake water.\n\n[[Muckross Lake]] is the deepest of the three lakes.<ref name=Lakes/> It has a maximum depth of {{convert|73.5|m|ft}},<ref name=Power/> close to where the steeply sloping side of Torc Mountain enters the lake.<ref name=Lakes/> The lake lies on the geological boundary between the sandstone mountains to the south and west and the limestone to the north.<ref name=Power/>\n\nLough Leane and Muckross Lake lie across the geological boundary. The presence of limestone causes both of the lakes to be slightly richer in nutrients than the Upper Lake. There are many caves in the limestone at lake level, created by [[wave action]] combined with the [[Solvation|dissolution]] effect of the lakes' [[acid]]ic water on the exposed rock. These caves are largest on the northern shore of Muckross Lake.<ref name=Lakes/>\n\nFrom the Meeting of the Waters a narrow channel called the Long Range leads to the Upper Lake, the smallest of the three lakes. This lake is located in rugged mountain scenery in the upper Killarney/Black Valley area. The fast [[Surface runoff|run-off]] in its catchment area can cause the level of the lake to rise by up to a meter in a few hours during heavy rain.<ref name=Lakes/>\n\nMuckross Lake and the Upper Lake are high quality [[oligotroph]]ic systems, with water that is slightly acidic and low in nutrients. This is caused by run-off from the upland sandstones and blanket bogs in their catchment areas.<ref name=Lakes/> They have diverse [[Aquatic plant|aquatic vegetation]], including [[Iso\u00ebtes|quillwort]] (''Isoetes lacustris''), [[shoreweed]] (''Littorella uniflora''), and [[Lobelia dortmanna|water lobelia]] (''Lobelia dortmanna'').<ref name=Media4452/>\n\nAll three lakes are very acid sensitive and therefore vulnerable to [[afforestation]] within their catchment areas.<ref name=Media3866/>                                                                                              \n\n\n==Woodlands==\nKillarney possesses the most extensive area (approximately {{convert|120|km2|acre}}) of semi-natural native woodland (woodland dominated by [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous species]]) remaining in Ireland. Most of this woodland is encompassed by the national park. There are three main types of woodland in the park: [[acidophilous]] oak woodland (''Quercus petraea-Ilex aquifolium'') on Devonian sandstone; [[moss]]-rich yew woodland (''Taxus baccata'') on Carboniferous limestone outcrops;<ref name=Kelly1981/> and wet woodland (also called carr) dominated by [[Alnus glutinosa|alder]] on low-lying swampy limestone soils on the lake edges.<ref name=Oakwoods/> The woods in the park fall naturally into two sectors, along the geologic divide.<ref name=Kelly1981/> The oak and yew woodlands are of international importance.<ref name=Perrin/>\n\n[[Mixed woodland]] and [[conifer plantation]]s also occur in the park.<ref name=Media4452/> The mixed woodland on Ross Island has one of the richest [[herb layer]]s in the park's woods.<ref name=Media3866/>\n\nGrazing and [[rhododendron]] invasion threaten the park's woodlands. Rhododendrons affect approximately two-thirds of the oak woodlands. A rhododendron removal programme is under way in the park. The yew woodlands have been negatively affected by heavy grazing for many years.<ref name=Media3866/>\n\n===Oak woodlands===\nThe park is perhaps most famous for its oak woodlands,<ref name=Media4452/> which are about {{convert|12.2|km2|acre}} in size.<ref name=Sullivan/> They form the largest area of native woodland remaining in Ireland and are a remnant of the woodland that once covered much of Ireland. Derrycunihy Wood is perhaps the most natural [[sessile oak]] (''Quercus petraea'') wood in Ireland. Most of the oak woodlands are located on the lower slopes of the Shehy and Tomy mountains, adjacent to Lough Leane. They are typically dominated by sessile oak, which favours the acidic soils of the sandstone mountains.<ref name=Oakwoods/> The woods have Annex I status in the [[Habitats Directive|EU Habitats Directive]] because of their diverse and rich flora, most notably their [[bryophyte]]s ([[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s).<ref name=Perrin/>\n\nThe oak woodlands typically have an [[understory]] of [[Ilex aquifolium|holly]] (''Ilex aquifolium''). [[Arbutus unedo|Strawberry trees]] (''Arbutus unedo'') are a notable part of these woods. There are also scattered [[Taxus baccata|yews]].<ref name=Media4452/> The [[field layer]] includes [[bilberry]] and [[woodrush]].<ref name=Oakwoods/> The herb layer is not rich in species.<ref name=Media3866/>\n\nBryophytes, [[lichen]]s and [[Hymenophyllaceae|filmy ferns]] (''Hymenophyllaceae''), thrive in the humid oceanic climate. Species with restricted Atlantic [[Species distribution|distributions]] grow in the woods.<ref name=Perrin/> The bryophytes in these woods are perhaps the best-developed Atlantic [[bryophyte]] community in Europe.<ref name=Media4452/> The remote Glaism na Marbh valley has a particularly rich flora of bryophytes, some of which are scarce or absent in other parts of the woods.<ref name=Sullivan/> Mosses, ferns and liverworts frequently occur as epiphytes, attached to the trunks and branches of oak trees.<ref name=Oakwoods/> Rare species growing in the woods include ''[[Cyclodictyon laetivirens]]'', ''[[Daltonia splachnoides]]'', ''[[Lejeunea flava]]'', ''[[Radula carringtonii]]'', and ''[[Sematophyllum demissum]]''.<ref name=Media3866/>\n\nBird species that reside in the oak woods include [[blue tit]], [[common chaffinch]], [[goldcrest]], [[European robin]], and [[wren]]. Mammals include [[badger]], fox, [[pine marten]], [[red deer]], [[sika deer]], and [[red squirrel]]. Insects include many species of the parasitic [[gall wasp]] and the [[purple hairstreak]] butterfly, whose caterpillar is entirely dependent upon oak trees.<ref name=Oakwoods/>\n\nThe introduced common rhododendron is a large threat to certain areas of the oak woods.<ref name=Oakwoods/> For example, it is widespread throughout Camillan Wood despite ongoing attempts to control it.<ref name=Perrin/>\n\n===Yew woodlands===\n[[File:Reenadinna Yew Wood1.jpg|thumb|right|Reenadinna yew wood]]\nThe [[Taxus baccata|yew]] woodland in the park is known as Reenadinna Wood.

Overgrazing of the woodland floor by sika deer may be part of the reason for this, but small areas of the wood that have been fenced off since 1969 have experienced very little yew regeneration. The dense canopy created by the yew trees that lets very little sunlight through to the woodland floor may also prevent the growth of yew seedlings.<ref name=Reenadinna/>\n\nDespite its poisonous properties, yew is very susceptible to browsing and bark stripping by deer, rabbits, hare, and domestic animals. It is one of the most grazing sensitive trees in the Killarney woodlands. sika deer have killed yews by scoring the trees with their antlers.<ref name=PAThomas/>\n\n===Wet woodlands===\nWet woodland (also called carr) on the low-lying swampy limestone areas within Lough Leane's [[floodplain]] is about {{convert|1.7|km2|acre}} in size.<ref name=Kelly>{{cite book\n |last        = Kelly\n |first       = Daniel L.\n |author2     = Susan F.

Large-flowered [[butterwort]] (''Pinguicula grandiflora'') is common. The bogs also support a number of notable species, including mosses (''Sphagnum pulchrum'', ''S. fuscum'', ''S. platyphyllum'', ''S. strictum'', ''S. contortum'' and ''Calliergon stramineum''), liverworts (''Cladopodiella francisci'' and ''Calypogeia azurea'') and lichens (''Cladonia mediterranea'', ''C. macilenta'', ''C. rangiferina'', ''C. arbuscula'' and ''Cetraria islandica'').<ref name=Media4452/>\n\nThe remoteness of some of the upland areas aids the survival of Ireland's only remaining wild herd of native red deer.<ref name=KNPAbout/> The bogs are threatened by grazing, [[turbary]], burning and afforestation.<ref name=Media3866/>\n\n==Flora==\nA large number of plant and animal species of interest occur within the site, including most of the native Irish mammal species, several important fish species including [[Arctic char]], and a range of rare or scarce plant species.<ref name=Media4452/> Several of the animal and plant species in the park have a hiberno-lusitanean distribution, meaning that they only occur in southwest Ireland, northern Spain, and [[Portugal]].

These plant species are grouped within four main categories: arctic-alpine plants, Atlantic species, North American species and very rare species. Atlantic species are species which are otherwise found mostly in southern and south-western Europe, for example [[arbutus]], [[St Patrick's cabbage]] and [[greater butterwort]]. North American species include [[blue-eyed grass]] and [[pipewort]].<ref name=NPWS/>\n\n===Bryophytes===\nBryophytes (mosses and liverworts) flourish in the park, due partly to the area's mild oceanic climate. The park is internationally significant for bryophytes. Many of the bryophytes found in the park are not found anywhere else in Ireland.<ref name=Species/> Mosses, ferns such as filmy ferns, and liverworts grow luxuriantly. Many of them live as epiphytes, growing on the branches and trunks of trees.<ref name=NPWS/>\n\n===Other plant species===\nThe Killarney fern (''[[Trichomanes speciosum]]'') is probably the most rare plant species in the park. It is a [[filmy fern]] that grows in the [[splash zone]] of waterfalls and other damp places. Although it was once quite common, it was picked almost to extinction when pickers collected it to be sold to tourists. The few sites where this fern remain tend to be in isolated mountainous locations where pickers never found it.<ref name=Species/>\n\nAlthough the [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (''Arbutus unedo'') is relatively common in the park, it is one of Ireland's rarest native tree species and is found in very few locations outside Killarney. In the park it is found on cliff tops and the edges of the woodlands around the lake.<ref name=Species/>\n\nKillarney [[whitebeam]] (''Sorbus anglica'') is a shrub or small tree that grows on rocks close to lakeshores. It is found only in Killarney. The more common Irish whitebeam (''Sorbus hibernica'') is also found in the park.<ref name=Species/>\n\nThe [[greater butterwort]] (''Pinguicula grandiflora'') (also known as the Kerry violet) is a [[carnivorous plant]] found in bogs. It digests insects to supplement the poor supply of nutrients (especially nitrogen) available from the bog. Its purple flowers bloom in late May and early June.<ref name=Species/>\n\nIrish [[spurge]] (''Euphorbia hyberna'') is an Atlantic species that in Ireland is only found in the southwest. In the past the milky [[sap]] from its stem was used to cure warts. Fishermen used it to capture fish, utilising compounds in the sap that prevent fish gills from functioning properly and so suffocate the fish.<ref name=Species/>\n\nA number of rare species of myxomycete fungus have been recorded in the park. These are ''Collaria arcyrionema'', ''Craterium muscorum'', ''Cribraria microcarpa'' (the only known location in Ireland), ''C. rufa'', ''C. violacea'', ''Diderma chondrioderma'', ''D. lucidum'', ''D. ochraceum'', ''Fuligo muscorum'', and ''Licea marginata''.<ref name=Media3866/> The park has a highly diverse lichen flora.<ref name=Species/>\n\n==Fauna==\n\n===Mammals===\nMost mammals native to Ireland and long established introduced species are found in the park.<ref name=NPWS/> The [[bank vole]] was first identified in 1964 in northwest Kerry.

Other species that live on the lakes are the [[black-headed gull]], [[little grebe]], and [[mute swan]].<ref name=Media4452/>\n\nSpecies that migrate from Africa in the summer include [[Common cuckoo|cuckoo]]s, [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]], and [[Swift (bird)|swifts]]. Some species are vagrants that appear sporadically, for example when there is stormy weather or an unusually cold spell on the European continent.<ref name=BirdLife/>\n\nThe park is also the site for a project to reintroduce [[white-tailed eagle]]s, which began in 2007 with the release of fifteen birds. The project will last a number of years with many more eagles being released. The species had become extinct in Ireland in the 19th century after persecution from landowners. Fifteen chicks will then be brought in annually for the following five years.<ref>[http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0816/eagles.html RT\u00c9 News \u2013 Rare eagle reintroduced to Ireland \u2013 August 2007]</ref> Despite a poisoning incident in 2009, the program is continuing<ref>[http://www.glencarhouse.com/news/2009/04/see-the-white-tailed-eagle-in-kerry-ireland/ update on white tailed eagles April 2009] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419014600/http://www.glencarhouse.com/news/2009/04/see-the-white-tailed-eagle-in-kerry-ireland/ |date=19 April 2009 }}</ref> and birds introduced to the area have now been tracked to Wicklow and Donegal.\n\n===Fish species===\nThe Lakes of Killarney contain many brown trout and an annual run of salmon. Rare species found in the lakes are Arctic char and Killarney shad.<ref name=Lakes/> The lakes have natural stocks of [[brown trout]] and [[salmon]] that can be fished, subject only to usual Irish salmon license regulations.<ref name=NPWS/>\n\nThe lakes contain [[Arctic char]] (''Salvelinus alpinus'' L.), which is usually found much further north in sub-Arctic lakes.<ref name=NPWS/> It's a [[relict|relict species]] left behind in the area after the last Ice Age, and are consequently indicative of pristine environmental conditions. Although they were once widespread, they now are confined to isolated populations in inland freshwater lakes that have a suitable habitat. They are isolated in their respective lakes since the last Ice age. They are extremely sensitive to environmental changes when they are as far south as Ireland, where they are at the southern edge of their species range. The greatest threats to their survival in Ireland are introduced fish species, eutrophication, acidification and climate change. The rate of extinction of entire populations in Ireland has increased in recent decades.<ref name=Igoe>{{cite book\n |last        = Igoe\n |first       = Fran\n |author2     = Johna Hammar\n |title       = The Arctic Char Salvelinus Alpinus (L.)

It is unique to the Lakes of Killarney. It is rarely seen because it feeds mainly on plankton and thus is rarely caught by fishers. It is listed in the Irish \"Red Data Book\" of threatened species.<ref name=Species/> It is listed in Annex II of the EU [[Habitats Directive]].<ref name=Media3866/>\n\n===Invertebrates===\nSeveral unusual invertebrate species can be found in the Killarney valley. Some of these species, including the [[northern emerald]] dragonfly (''Somatochlora arctica'') and several [[caddisfly]] and [[stonefly]] species are usually found much further north in Europe. They are thought to be [[relict species]] that were left behind in Killarney after the last retreat of ice.<ref name=Species/> The northern or moorland emerald [[dragonfly]], the rarest Irish dragonfly, is confined to the park.

It emerges in Killarney's frequent wet weather to graze on [[lichen]]s on rcks and tree trunks. It is reputedly the only slug capable of rolling itself into a ball. It is on both Annex II and Annex IV of the EU [[Habitats Directive]].<ref name=Species/>\n\n==Conservation threats==\n[[File:Torc Waterfall at Killarney National Park2.jpg|thumb|right|Wild rhododendrons growing beside Owengarriff river.]]\n[[File:O'Sullivan's Cascade.jpg|thumb|O'Sullivan's Cascade]]\nThe park has a number of conservation and management challenges. One of these is the park's proximity to Killarney town, one of Ireland's best known tourist destinations. Killarney has hundreds of thousands of visitors every year. Most of these visitors spend time in the park. Careful management is needed to ensure minimal conflict between conservation and recreation.<ref name=KNPAbout/>\n\nThe past introduction of several [[exotic species]] to the park is an additional human influence on the area. These species have damaged the natural ecosystems of Killarney. The most notable of these species are the common rhododendron (''Rhododendron ponticum''), which has infested large areas of the National Park, and sika deer, which overgraze the woodland floor and pose a potential threat to the genetic integrity of the native red deer. Both rhododendron and sika deer can have an adverse effect on the native flora by inhibiting regeneration. A more recent, accidental, introduction is the [[American mink]], which is now firmly established in the park alongside the native otter. Extinctions caused by humans include the [[wolf]] (''Canis lupus L.'') and the [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos L.'').<ref name=Heritage>{{cite web\n |last=D\u00fachas \n |authorlink=D\u00fachas \n |title=Cultural Heritage \n |url=http://homepage.eircom.net/%7Eknp/sites/index.htm#abb \n |accessdate=1 July 2007 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105247/http://homepage.eircom.net/~knp/sites/index.htm \n |archivedate= 7 February 2007 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\nFires caused by human activity occur with some frequency in the park. Despite the wet climate, they can spread quite rapidly to cover large areas. These fires rarely penetrate areas covered by dense woodlands, but they do burn readily through stands of open woodland.<ref name=Sullivan/>\n\nThe main land use within the site is grazing by sheep.<ref name=Media3866/> Deer grazing is also common. The woods in the park are currently severely overgrazed by sika deer.<ref name=Cross/> Grazing has caused damage to many terrestrial habitats, causing heath and blanket bogs to degrade and preventing woodland regeneration. In the upland areas erosion caused by grazing is exacerbated by the exposed nature of the terrain.<ref name=Media3866/> Pressures from native grazers like red deer and Irish hare have increased since their main natural predators, the wolf and golden eagle, became extinct.<ref name=Perrin/> Grazing and disturbance of vegetation greatly aids the spread of rhododendron.<ref name=Cross/>\n\nThe common rhododendron is perhaps the greatest threat to the ecology of the park.<ref name=Rhododendron>{{cite web\n  | last = D\u00fachas\n  | authorlink = D\u00fachas\n  | title = Rhododendron Infestation\n  | website =\n  | url = http://homepage.eircom.net/~knp/rhodo/index.htm\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 1 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070207105236/http://homepage.eircom.net/~knp/rhodo/index.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 February 2007}}</ref> It is an evergreen shrub with a natural distribution in the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]] areas.<ref name= Erfmeier>{{cite journal\n  | last = Erfmeier\n  | first = Alexandra\n  | authorlink =\n  |author2=Helge Bruelheide\n   | title = Comparison of native and invasive \"Rhododendron ponticum\" populations: Growth, reproduction and morphology under field conditions\n  | journal = Flora\n  | volume = 119\n  | issue =2\n  | pages = 120\u2013133\n  | year = 2004\n  | doi = 10.1078/0367-2530-00141\n  | id =\n  }}</ref> Rhododendrons died out in Ireland because of climate change thousands of years ago.<ref name=Rhododendron/> It was introduced to the Killarney area during the 19th century, and rapidly took hold.

There is a network of surfaced paths in the Knockreer, Muckross, and Ross Island areas that can be used by cyclists and walkers. The Old Kenmare Road and the track around Tomies Oakwood have views over Lough Leane and Killarney. Boat trips on the lakes are available.<ref name=Visiting/>\n\nMuckross House is a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansion, close to Muckross Lake's eastern shore, beneath the backdrop of Mangerton and Torc mountains. The house has now been restored and attracts more than 250,000 visitors a year. Muckross Gardens are famous for their collection of rhododendrons, hybrids and azaleas, and exotic trees. Muckross Traditional Farms is a working farm project that recreates Irish rural life in the 1930s, prior to electrification.

Later, Crete fell under Roman rule, and afterwards the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Andalusia]]n [[Arabs]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]] successively ruled Crete. The Cretan people, who maintained a desire to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans in 1898 as the [[Cretan State]] and became part of Greece in December 1913.\n\nThe island is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east; the range of the [[Lefka Ori|White Mountains]] (Lefka Ori) contains Crete's highest point, [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]]. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own [[Mantinada|poetry]] and [[Cretan music|music]]).

It lies approximately {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Greek mainland.\n\n===Mountains and valleys===\n<!--Linked from [[:Category:Mountains of Crete]]-->\n\nCrete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by three different groups of mountains:\n*The White Mountains or [[Lefka Ori]] {{convert|2454|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*The Idi Range ([[Psiloritis]] {{Coord|35.18|N|24.82|E|}} {{convert|2456|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*[[Mount Kedros|Kedros]] {{convert|1777|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*The [[Dikti|Dikti Mountains]] {{convert|2148|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Thripti {{convert|1489|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n\nThese mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as [[Amari Valley|Amari valley]], fertile plateaus, such as [[Lasithi Plateau|Lasithi plateau]], [[Omalos]] and [[Nidha]]; caves, such as [[Gourgouthakas]], [[Diktaion]], and [[Idaion]] (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god [[Zeus]]); and a number of gorges.\n\nMountains in Crete are the object of tremendous fascination both for locals and tourists. The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic but also moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame: Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=23\u201358 |url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=809810}}</ref>\n\n===Gorges, rivers and lakes===\nThe island has a number of gorges, such as the [[Samari\u00e1 Gorge]], [[Imbros Gorge]], [[Kourtaliotiko Gorge]], [[Ha Gorge]], [[Platania Gorge]], the Gorge of the Dead (at [[Kato Zakros]], [[Sitia]]) and [[Richtis Gorge]] and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in [[Sitia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/Gorges/Lassithi-gorges/kato-zakros-gorge-deads-gorge/ |title=Gorge of the Dead |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |title=Richtis gorge |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |accessdate=13 September 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731062158/http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |archive-date=31 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://candia.wordpress.com/photos/photo-2010/richtis-gorge-april-2010/ |title=Richtis beach and gorge |publisher=Candia.wordpress.com |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/canyon/richtis-gorge-and-waterfall/61078/ |title=Richtis gorge and waterfall |publisher=Worldreviewer.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe rivers of Crete include the [[Ieropotamos River]], the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, and Megas Potamos.

Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[biologist]]s. Some are [[Environmental protection|environmentally protected]]. A small sample of the islands includes:\n*[[Gramvousa]] ([[Kissamos]], [[Chania]]) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon\n*[[Elafonisi]] ([[Chania]]), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre\n*[[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]] island ([[Ierapetra]], [[Lasithi]]), which hosts the largest natural [[Cedrus libani|Lebanon cedar]] forest in Europe\n*[[Paximadia]] island (Agia Galini, [[Rethymno]]) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born\n*The Venetian fort and leper colony at [[Spinalonga]] opposite the beach and shallow waters of [[Elounda]] ([[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]], Lasithi)\n*[[Dionysades]] islands which are in an environmentally protected region together the Palm Beach Forest of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] in the municipality of [[Sitia]], Lasithi\n\nOff the south coast, the island of [[Gavdos]] is located {{convert|26|nmi|km|0}} south of [[Hora Sfakion]] and is the [[Extreme points of Europe|southernmost]] point of [[Europe]].\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Greece}}\nCrete straddles two climatic zones, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[North African]], mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.\n\nThe south coast, including the [[Mesara Plain]] and [[Asterousia Mountains]], falls in the [[North Africa]]n climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, [[date palm]]s bear fruit, and [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]] remain year-round rather than migrate to [[Africa]]. The fertile region around [[Ierapetra]], on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in [[greenhouse]]s throughout the winter.<ref>Rackham, O. & Moody, J., 1996.

However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3vxvYOZkj4C&pg=PR11&dq=economy+Crete&hl=en#v=onepage&q=economy%20Crete&f=false The rough guide to Crete, Introduction, p. ix] by J. Fisher and G. Garvey.</ref> The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.\n\nAs in many regions of Greece, [[viticulture]] and [[olive]] groves are significant; [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[Greek citron|citrons]] and [[Avocado|avocadoes]] are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as [[mizithra]], [[anthotyros]], and [[kefalotyri]].\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 9.4 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 17,800 \u20ac or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fith highest GDP per capita.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Transport infrastructure===\n[[File:Kreta - Europastra\u00dfe75 2.jpg|thumb|[[European route E75]] near [[Heraklion]]]]\n\n====Airports====\nThe island has three significant airports, [[Heraklion International Airport, \"Nikos Kazantzakis\"|Nikos Kazantzakis]] at [[Heraklion]], the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] and a [[Sitia Public Airport|smaller one]] in [[Sitia]]. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers.  There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.\n\n====Ferries====\nThe island is well served by ferries, mostly from [[Athens]], by ferry companies such as [[Minoan Lines]] and [[ANEK Lines]].\n\n====Road Network====\nAlthough the road network leads almost everywhere, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/projects/greece/new-road-in-crete-set-to-improve-journey-times-and-safety|title=New road in Crete set to improve journey times and safety-Projects|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}</ref> In addition, a European study has been devised from European Union to promote a modern highway that will connect the North and the South parts of the island via a tunnel. According to the study the project should be include 15.7 km of section of road between the villages Agia Varvara and Agia Deka in central Crete, benefits both tourists and local people by improving the accessibility to the southern part of the island and lessen the accidents. The new road section forms part of the route between Messara in the south and Crete\u2019s capital city Heraklion, which provides the island\u2019s airport and principal sea port link with mainland Greece. Traffic speeds on the new road will increase by 19 km/hour (from 29 km/hours to 48 km/hour), which should reduce journey times between Messara and Heraklion by 55 minutes. The scheme is also expected to improve road safety by cutting the number of accidents along the route. Building works include construction of three road tunnels, five bridges and three junctions. This project is expected to create 44 jobs during the implementation phase.  \n\nThe investment falls under Greece's \"Improvement of Accessibility\" Operational Programme. The programme aims to improve the country\u2019s transport infrastructures as well as its international connections. It will therefore have a key role to play in making Greece\u2019s remote and landlocked regions more accessible and economically attractive. This Operational Programme works to link Greece\u2019s more prosperous and less developed regions, which should help to promote greater territorial cohesion.\n\nTotal investment for the project \"Completion of construction of the section of Ag.

A number of city states developed in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and [[Greek historiography]] shows little interest in Crete, and as a result, there are very few literary sources.\n\nDuring the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The [[Gortyn code]] (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.\n\nIn the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, [[Gortyn]], Kydonia ([[Chania]]), [[Lyctus|Lyttos]] and [[Polyrrhenia]] challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.\n\nWhile the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like [[Macedon]] and its rivals [[Rhodes]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a [[Lyttian War|war between two opposing coalitions of cities]]. As a result, the Macedonian king [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] gained [[hegemony]] over Crete which lasted to the end of the [[Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC)]], when the [[Rhodes|Rhodians]] opposed the rise of Macedon and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] started to interfere in Cretan affairs.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC Ierapytna ([[Ierapetra]]) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.\n\n===Roman rule===\n{{Main|Crete and Cyrenaica}}\nCrete was involved in the [[Mithridatic Wars]], initially repelling an attack by Roman general [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]] in 71&nbsp;BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus (died 55&nbsp;BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69&nbsp;BC, earning for Metellus the title \"''Creticus''\". [[Gortyn]] was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with [[Cyrenaica]] that was called [[Creta et Cyrenaica]]. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jane Francis and Anna Kouremenos |title=Roman Crete: New Perspectives |date=2016 |publisher=Oxbow |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1785700958}}</ref> In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the [[Panhellenion]], a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor [[Hadrian]]. When [[Diocletian]] redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the [[diocese of Moesia]], and later by [[Constantine I]] to the [[diocese of Macedonia]].\n\n===Byzantine Empire \u2013 first period===\n{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}\n\n[[File:Crete MoniArkadiou1 tango7174.jpg|thumb|[[Arkadi Monastery]]]]\n\nCrete was separated from Cyrenaica {{circa|297}}. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by [[Vandals]] in 467, the great earthquakes of [[365 Crete earthquake|365]] and 415, a raid by [[Slavs]] in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century.

Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.\n\nCrete was left out of the modern Greek state by the [[London Protocol of 1830]], and soon it was yielded to [[Egypt]] by the Ottoman [[sultan]]. Egyptian rule was short-lived and sovereignty was returned to the Ottoman Empire by the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]] on 3 July 1840.\n\nHeraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, \"the deserted city\".<ref name=\"Greene\"/> The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach.<ref name=\"Greene\"/> The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of [[real-estate]] transactions during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property.

A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the ''Holocaust of Arkadi''. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the [[Arkadi Monastery]], which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.\n\n===Cretan State 1898\u20131908===\n{{Main|Cretan State|Theriso revolt|Candia massacre}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Revolutionnaires therissos.jpg|thumb|Revolutionaries at [[Theriso]]]]\n\nFollowing the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the [[Great powers#History|Great Powers]] decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman [[suzerainty]] in the near future.<ref>Pinar Senisik, ''The Transformation of Ottoman Crete, Revolts, Politics and Identity in the Late Nineteenth century'' p. 165.

The initial 11-day battle was bloody and left more than 11,000 soldiers and civilians killed or wounded. As a result of the fierce resistance from both Allied forces and civilian Cretan locals, the invasion force suffered heavy casualties, and [[Adolf Hitler]] forbade further large-scale [[paratroop]] operations for the rest of the war. During the initial and subsequent occupation, German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers; civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings, such as at the [[Massacre of Kondomari]] and the [[Viannos massacres]]. Two German generals were later tried and executed for their roles in the killing of 3,000 of the island's inhabitants.<ref>[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/warcrimgenrls.htm \"Some Noteworthy War Criminals\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401143013/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/warcrimgenrls.htm |date=1 April 2012 }}, Source: ''History of the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the Development of the Laws of War'', United Nations War Crimes Commission.

Overall, more than two million tourists visited Crete some years back,{{When|date=August 2011}} when the increase in tourism was reflected in the number of hotel beds, rising by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991.\n\nToday, the island's tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes, including a very wide range of accommodation; the island's facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and [[Chania]] and a smaller airport in [[Sitia]] (international charter and domestic flights starting May 2012)<ref>[http://www.sitia.gr/information-services/news/aerchart.html Charter flights to Sitia in 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001191455/http://www.sitia.gr/information-services/news/aerchart.html |date=1 October 2011 }}</ref> or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, [[Rethimno]], [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]] and [[Sitia]].\n\nPopular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of [[Chania]], the Venetian castle at [[Rethymno]], the gorge of [[Samari\u00e1 Gorge|Samaria]], the islands of [[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]], [[Elafonisi]], [[Gramvousa]], [[Spinalonga]] and the Palm Beach of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]], which is the largest natural palm forest in Europe.\n\n===Transportation===\nCrete has an extensive bus system with regular services across the north of the island and from north to south. There are two regional bus stations in [[Heraklion]]. Bus routes and timetables can be found on KTEL website.<ref>[http://www.e-ktel.com/en/ KTEL bus services]</ref>\n\n=== Holiday homes and immigration ===\nCrete's mild climate attracts interest from [[northern Europe]]ans who want a holiday home or residence on the island.

According to her, these forces have strengthened in 3 stages: from the period from 1960\u20131970, 1970\u20131990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"140\">\nFile:Gortys R02.jpg|View of [[Gortyn]]\nFile:Festos1(js).jpg|Archaeological site of [[Phaistos]]\nFile:Knossos south propylaeum.jpg|Ruins of the [[Knossos|Palace of Knossos]]\nFile:Archaeological Museum of Chania.jpg|Archeological Museum of [[Chania]]\nFile:AMC Intern of Museum of Chania (Crete) 2.jpg|[[Chania|Museum of Chania]]\nFile:Chania naval museum.jpg|Chania Naval museum\nFile:Pluto Serapis and Persephone Isis Heraklion museum.jpg|[[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] and [[Persephone]] in [[Heraklion]] Museum\nFile:Jars in Malia Crete the two.jpg|Jars in [[Malia, Crete|Malia]], Crete\n</gallery>\n\n== Fauna and flora ==\n\n===Fauna===\n\nCrete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and poisonous snakes, to the labour of [[Hercules]] (who took a live Cretan bull to the [[Peloponnese]]). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of [[Zeus]] by removing all \"harmful\" and \"poisonous\" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the [[Apostle Paul]], who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a [[natural history museum]], the [[Natural History Museum of Crete]], operating under the direction of the [[University of Crete]] and two aquariums \u2013 [[Aquaworld Aquarium|Aquaworld]] in [[Hersonissos]] and [[Cretaquarium]] in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.\n\n====Prehistoric fauna====\n[[Dwarf elephant]]s, [[Hippopotamus creutzburgi|dwarf hippopotamus]], [[dwarf mammoths]], [[Candiacervus|dwarf deer]], and [[Cretan owl|giant flightless owls]] were native to [[Pleistocene]] Crete.<ref>Van der Geer, A.A.E., Dermitzakis, M., De Vos, J., 2006.

The [[Paximadia]] islands were the birthplace of the goddess [[Artemis]] and the god [[Apollo]]. Their mother, the goddess [[Leto]], was worshipped at [[Phaistos]]. The goddess [[Athena]] bathed in Lake Voulismeni. The ancient Greek god [[Zeus]] launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the island of [[Dia (island)|Dia]]. The island can be seen from Knossos and it has the shape of a giant lizard. The islets of [[Souda (island)|Lefkai]] were the result of a musical contest between the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s and the [[Muses]].

The island is known for its Mantinades-based [[Music of Crete|music]] (typically performed with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|Cretan lyra]] and the [[laouto]]) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the [[Pentozali]]. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 90s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=153\u2013178}}</ref>\n\nCretan authors have made important contributions to [[Greek Literature]] throughout the modern period; major names include [[Vikentios Kornaros]], creator of the 17th-century epic romance ''[[Erotokritos]]'' (Greek \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and, in the 20th century, [[Nikos Kazantzakis]].

The [[Peloponnese]] is to the region's northwest.\n\nHumans have inhabited the island since at least 130,000 years ago, during the [[Paleolithic]] age.

Later, Crete fell under Roman rule, and afterwards the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Andalusia]]n [[Arabs]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]] successively ruled Crete. The Cretan people, who maintained a desire to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans in 1898 as the [[Cretan State]] and became part of Greece in December 1913.\n\nThe island is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east; the range of the [[Lefka Ori|White Mountains]] (Lefka Ori) contains Crete's highest point, [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]]. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own [[Mantinada|poetry]] and [[Cretan music|music]]).

Under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], Crete was called ''Girit'' ({{lang|ota|\u0643\u0631\u064a\u062a}}).\n\n==Physical geography==\n{{Main|Geography of Greece}}\n[[File:Mount Ida chain Messara plain from Phaistos Crete Greece.jpg|thumb|[[Messara Plain]]]]\n[[File:Vai R02.jpg|thumb|The palm beach of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]]]]\n\n[[File:Lefka Ori.jpg|thumb|[[Lefka Ori]]]]\n[[File:Psiloritis3(js).jpg|thumb|View of [[Psiloritis]]]]\n\nCrete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is located in the southern part of the [[Aegean Sea]] separating the Aegean from the [[Libyan Sea]].\n\n===Island morphology===\n\nThe island has an elongated shape: it spans {{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west, is {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} at its widest point, and narrows to as little as {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} (close to [[Ierapetra]]). Crete covers an area of {{convert|8336|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, with a coastline of {{convert|1046|km|mi|abbr=on}}; to the north, it broaches the [[Sea of Crete]] ({{lang-el|\u039a\u03c1\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2|links=no}}); to the south, the [[Libyan Sea]] ({{lang-el|links=no|\u039b\u03b9\u03b2\u03c5\u03ba\u03cc \u03a0\u03ad\u03bb\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2}}); in the west, the [[Myrtoan Sea]], and toward the east the Karpathian Sea. It lies approximately {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Greek mainland.\n\n===Mountains and valleys===\n<!--Linked from [[:Category:Mountains of Crete]]-->\n\nCrete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by three different groups of mountains:\n*The White Mountains or [[Lefka Ori]] {{convert|2454|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*The Idi Range ([[Psiloritis]] {{Coord|35.18|N|24.82|E|}} {{convert|2456|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*[[Mount Kedros|Kedros]] {{convert|1777|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*The [[Dikti|Dikti Mountains]] {{convert|2148|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n*Thripti {{convert|1489|m|ft|abbr=on}}\n\nThese mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as [[Amari Valley|Amari valley]], fertile plateaus, such as [[Lasithi Plateau|Lasithi plateau]], [[Omalos]] and [[Nidha]]; caves, such as [[Gourgouthakas]], [[Diktaion]], and [[Idaion]] (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god [[Zeus]]); and a number of gorges.\n\nMountains in Crete are the object of tremendous fascination both for locals and tourists. The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic but also moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as Sfakia in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame: Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=23\u201358 |url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=809810}}</ref>\n\n===Gorges, rivers and lakes===\nThe island has a number of gorges, such as the [[Samari\u00e1 Gorge]], [[Imbros Gorge]], [[Kourtaliotiko Gorge]], [[Ha Gorge]], [[Platania Gorge]], the Gorge of the Dead (at [[Kato Zakros]], [[Sitia]]) and [[Richtis Gorge]] and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in [[Sitia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/Gorges/Lassithi-gorges/kato-zakros-gorge-deads-gorge/ |title=Gorge of the Dead |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |title=Richtis gorge |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |accessdate=13 September 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731062158/http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |archive-date=31 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://candia.wordpress.com/photos/photo-2010/richtis-gorge-april-2010/ |title=Richtis beach and gorge |publisher=Candia.wordpress.com |date=20 April 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/canyon/richtis-gorge-and-waterfall/61078/ |title=Richtis gorge and waterfall |publisher=Worldreviewer.com |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe rivers of Crete include the [[Ieropotamos River]], the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, and Megas Potamos.

Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[biologist]]s. Some are [[Environmental protection|environmentally protected]]. A small sample of the islands includes:\n*[[Gramvousa]] ([[Kissamos]], [[Chania]]) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon\n*[[Elafonisi]] ([[Chania]]), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre\n*[[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]] island ([[Ierapetra]], [[Lasithi]]), which hosts the largest natural [[Cedrus libani|Lebanon cedar]] forest in Europe\n*[[Paximadia]] island (Agia Galini, [[Rethymno]]) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born\n*The Venetian fort and leper colony at [[Spinalonga]] opposite the beach and shallow waters of [[Elounda]] ([[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]], Lasithi)\n*[[Dionysades]] islands which are in an environmentally protected region together the Palm Beach Forest of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] in the municipality of [[Sitia]], Lasithi\n\nOff the south coast, the island of [[Gavdos]] is located {{convert|26|nmi|km|0}} south of [[Hora Sfakion]] and is the [[Extreme points of Europe|southernmost]] point of [[Europe]].\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Greece}}\nCrete straddles two climatic zones, the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the [[North African]], mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]]. The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas. While some mountain tops are snow-capped for most of the year, near the coast snow only stays on the ground for a few minutes or hours. However, a truly exceptional cold snap swept the island in February 2004, during which period the whole island was blanketed with snow. During the Cretan summer, average temperatures reach the high 20s-low 30s Celsius (mid 80s to mid 90s Fahrenheit), with maxima touching the upper 30s-mid 40s.\n\nThe south coast, including the [[Mesara Plain]] and [[Asterousia Mountains]], falls in the [[North Africa]]n climatic zone, and thus enjoys significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, [[date palm]]s bear fruit, and [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]] remain year-round rather than migrate to [[Africa]]. The fertile region around [[Ierapetra]], on the southeastern corner of the island, is renowned for its exceptional year-round agricultural production, with all kinds of summer vegetables and fruit produced in [[greenhouse]]s throughout the winter.<ref>Rackham, O. & Moody, J., 1996.

However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself independently without a tourism industry.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3vxvYOZkj4C&pg=PR11&dq=economy+Crete&hl=en#v=onepage&q=economy%20Crete&f=false The rough guide to Crete, Introduction, p. ix] by J. Fisher and G. Garvey.</ref> The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.\n\nAs in many regions of Greece, [[viticulture]] and [[olive]] groves are significant; [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[Greek citron|citrons]] and [[Avocado|avocadoes]] are also cultivated. Until recently there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of speciality cheeses such as [[mizithra]], [[anthotyros]], and [[kefalotyri]].\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 9.4 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 17,800 \u20ac or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fith highest GDP per capita.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Transport infrastructure===\n[[File:Kreta - Europastra\u00dfe75 2.jpg|thumb|[[European route E75]] near [[Heraklion]]]]\n\n====Airports====\nThe island has three significant airports, [[Heraklion International Airport, \"Nikos Kazantzakis\"|Nikos Kazantzakis]] at [[Heraklion]], the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] and a [[Sitia Public Airport|smaller one]] in [[Sitia]].

There is a long-standing plan to replace Heraklion airport with a completely new airport at Kastelli, where there is presently an air force base.\n\n====Ferries====\nThe island is well served by ferries, mostly from [[Athens]], by ferry companies such as [[Minoan Lines]] and [[ANEK Lines]].\n\n====Road Network====\nAlthough the road network leads almost everywhere, there is a lack of modern highways, although this is gradually changing with the completion of the northern coastal spine highway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/projects/greece/new-road-in-crete-set-to-improve-journey-times-and-safety|title=New road in Crete set to improve journey times and safety-Projects|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}</ref> In addition, a European study has been devised from European Union to promote a modern highway that will connect the North and the South parts of the island via a tunnel. According to the study the project should be include 15.7 km of section of road between the villages Agia Varvara and Agia Deka in central Crete, benefits both tourists and local people by improving the accessibility to the southern part of the island and lessen the accidents. The new road section forms part of the route between Messara in the south and Crete\u2019s capital city Heraklion, which provides the island\u2019s airport and principal sea port link with mainland Greece. Traffic speeds on the new road will increase by 19 km/hour (from 29 km/hours to 48 km/hour), which should reduce journey times between Messara and Heraklion by 55 minutes. The scheme is also expected to improve road safety by cutting the number of accidents along the route. Building works include construction of three road tunnels, five bridges and three junctions. This project is expected to create 44 jobs during the implementation phase.  \n\nThe investment falls under Greece's \"Improvement of Accessibility\" Operational Programme. The programme aims to improve the country\u2019s transport infrastructures as well as its international connections. It will therefore have a key role to play in making Greece\u2019s remote and landlocked regions more accessible and economically attractive. This Operational Programme works to link Greece\u2019s more prosperous and less developed regions, which should help to promote greater territorial cohesion.\n\nTotal investment for the project \"Completion of construction of the section of Ag.

A number of city states developed in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. There was very limited contact with mainland Greece, and [[Greek historiography]] shows little interest in Crete, and as a result, there are very few literary sources.\n\nDuring the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The [[Gortyn code]] (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.\n\nIn the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, [[Gortyn]], Kydonia ([[Chania]]), [[Lyctus|Lyttos]] and [[Polyrrhenia]] challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.\n\nWhile the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like [[Macedon]] and its rivals [[Rhodes]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a [[Lyttian War|war between two opposing coalitions of cities]]. As a result, the Macedonian king [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] gained [[hegemony]] over Crete which lasted to the end of the [[Cretan War (205\u2013200 BC)]], when the [[Rhodes|Rhodians]] opposed the rise of Macedon and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] started to interfere in Cretan affairs.\n\nIn the 2nd century BC Ierapytna ([[Ierapetra]]) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.\n\n===Roman rule===\n{{Main|Crete and Cyrenaica}}\nCrete was involved in the [[Mithridatic Wars]], initially repelling an attack by Roman general [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]] in 71&nbsp;BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus (died 55&nbsp;BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], equipped with three legions and Crete was finally conquered by Rome in 69&nbsp;BC, earning for Metellus the title \"''Creticus''\". [[Gortyn]] was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with [[Cyrenaica]] that was called [[Creta et Cyrenaica]]. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jane Francis and Anna Kouremenos |title=Roman Crete: New Perspectives |date=2016 |publisher=Oxbow |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1785700958}}</ref> In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the [[Panhellenion]], a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor [[Hadrian]].

It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by [[Vandals]] in 467, the great earthquakes of [[365 Crete earthquake|365]] and 415, a raid by [[Slavs]] in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century.

The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where all the elite were gathered together. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, \"the deserted city\".<ref name=\"Greene\"/> The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach.<ref name=\"Greene\"/> The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of [[real-estate]] transactions during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule.

A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the ''Holocaust of Arkadi''. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the [[Arkadi Monastery]], which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.\n\n===Cretan State 1898\u20131908===\n{{Main|Cretan State|Theriso revolt|Candia massacre}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Revolutionnaires therissos.jpg|thumb|Revolutionaries at [[Theriso]]]]\n\nFollowing the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the [[Great powers#History|Great Powers]] decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the very reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman [[suzerainty]] in the near future.<ref>Pinar Senisik, ''The Transformation of Ottoman Crete, Revolts, Politics and Identity in the Late Nineteenth century'' p. 165. I. B. Tauris, 2011.</ref>\n\nIn September 1898 an outbreak of rioting in Candia, modern Heraklion, left over 500 Cretan Christians, and 14 British servicemen, dead. As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, [[Prince George of Greece]], appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898.<ref name=Holland>Robert Holland and Diane Markides, ''The British and the Hellenes: Struggles for Mastery in the Eastern Mediterranean 1850\u20131960''. p. 81.

In 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece.\n\nWith the break out of the [[First Balkan War]], the Greek government declared that Crete was since then part of the Greek territory. This was not recognised internationally until 1 December 1913.<ref name=Holland/>\n\n===Second World War===\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 141-0864, Kreta, Landung von Fallschirmj\u00e4gern.jpg|thumb|German paratroopers landing on Crete during the [[Battle of Crete]]]]\n\n{{Main|Battle of Crete|Cretan resistance}}\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the island was the scene of the famous [[Battle of Crete]] in May 1941. The initial 11-day battle was bloody and left more than 11,000 soldiers and civilians killed or wounded. As a result of the fierce resistance from both Allied forces and civilian Cretan locals, the invasion force suffered heavy casualties, and [[Adolf Hitler]] forbade further large-scale [[paratroop]] operations for the rest of the war. During the initial and subsequent occupation, German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers; civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings, such as at the [[Massacre of Kondomari]] and the [[Viannos massacres]]. Two German generals were later tried and executed for their roles in the killing of 3,000 of the island's inhabitants.<ref>[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/warcrimgenrls.htm \"Some Noteworthy War Criminals\"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401143013/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/warcrimgenrls.htm |date=1 April 2012 }}, Source: ''History of the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the Development of the Laws of War'', United Nations War Crimes Commission.

Overall, more than two million tourists visited Crete some years back,{{When|date=August 2011}} when the increase in tourism was reflected in the number of hotel beds, rising by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991.\n\nToday, the island's tourism infrastructure caters to all tastes, including a very wide range of accommodation; the island's facilities take in large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and [[Chania]] and a smaller airport in [[Sitia]] (international charter and domestic flights starting May 2012)<ref>[http://www.sitia.gr/information-services/news/aerchart.html Charter flights to Sitia in 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001191455/http://www.sitia.gr/information-services/news/aerchart.html |date=1 October 2011 }}</ref> or by boat to the main ports of Heraklion, Chania, [[Rethimno]], [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]] and [[Sitia]].\n\nPopular tourist attractions include the archaeological sites of the Minoan civilisation, the Venetian old city and port of [[Chania]], the Venetian castle at [[Rethymno]], the gorge of [[Samari\u00e1 Gorge|Samaria]], the islands of [[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]], [[Elafonisi]], [[Gramvousa]], [[Spinalonga]] and the Palm Beach of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]], which is the largest natural palm forest in Europe.\n\n===Transportation===\nCrete has an extensive bus system with regular services across the north of the island and from north to south.

According to her, these forces have strengthened in 3 stages: from the period from 1960\u20131970, 1970\u20131990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"140\">\nFile:Gortys R02.jpg|View of [[Gortyn]]\nFile:Festos1(js).jpg|Archaeological site of [[Phaistos]]\nFile:Knossos south propylaeum.jpg|Ruins of the [[Knossos|Palace of Knossos]]\nFile:Archaeological Museum of Chania.jpg|Archeological Museum of [[Chania]]\nFile:AMC Intern of Museum of Chania (Crete) 2.jpg|[[Chania|Museum of Chania]]\nFile:Chania naval museum.jpg|Chania Naval museum\nFile:Pluto Serapis and Persephone Isis Heraklion museum.jpg|[[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] and [[Persephone]] in [[Heraklion]] Museum\nFile:Jars in Malia Crete the two.jpg|Jars in [[Malia, Crete|Malia]], Crete\n</gallery>\n\n== Fauna and flora ==\n\n===Fauna===\n\nCrete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and poisonous snakes, to the labour of [[Hercules]] (who took a live Cretan bull to the [[Peloponnese]]). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of [[Zeus]] by removing all \"harmful\" and \"poisonous\" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the [[Apostle Paul]], who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. There is a [[natural history museum]], the [[Natural History Museum of Crete]], operating under the direction of the [[University of Crete]] and two aquariums \u2013 [[Aquaworld Aquarium|Aquaworld]] in [[Hersonissos]] and [[Cretaquarium]] in Gournes, displaying sea creatures common in Cretan waters.\n\n====Prehistoric fauna====\n[[Dwarf elephant]]s, [[Hippopotamus creutzburgi|dwarf hippopotamus]], [[dwarf mammoths]], [[Candiacervus|dwarf deer]], and [[Cretan owl|giant flightless owls]] were native to [[Pleistocene]] Crete.<ref>Van der Geer, A.A.E., Dermitzakis, M., De Vos, J., 2006.

The islets of [[Souda (island)|Lefkai]] were the result of a musical contest between the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s and the [[Muses]]. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] (\"featherless\") where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of [[Souda (island)|Souda]] and [[Leon (Souda Bay)|Leon]]).<ref>Caroline M.

[[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]] were captives of [[King Minos]] and crafted wings to escape.

The island is known for its Mantinades-based [[Music of Crete|music]] (typically performed with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|Cretan lyra]] and the [[laouto]]) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the [[Pentozali]]. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 90s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet up and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is very often debated throughout Crete.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=153\u2013178}}</ref>\n\nCretan authors have made important contributions to [[Greek Literature]] throughout the modern period; major names include [[Vikentios Kornaros]], creator of the 17th-century epic romance ''[[Erotokritos]]'' (Greek \u0395\u03c1\u03c9\u03c4\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), and, in the 20th century, [[Nikos Kazantzakis]].

Te Wherowhero was almost killed<ref name=Mennell>{{cite Australasia|Potatau}}</ref> when he refused to retreat and abandon the body of a slain Waikato chief. The intervention of Te Rauparaha saved him, but subsequently he had to engage a number of enemy chiefs in single combat, armed with only a digging implement.<ref name=dnzb2010/> Eventually his own people returned and a negotiated truce ensued.\n\nTe Wherowhero returned to the Waikato that year in time to take command in an unsuccessful defence of his tribe at Matakitaki ([[Pirongia]]) against [[Ng\u0101puhi]], armed with [[musket]]s and led by [[Hongi Hika]] on their great rampage through the North Island of 1818 to 1823. The Waikato people settled further south than their usual territory for several years, in fear of further attacks by Ng\u0101puhi. Te Wherowhero lived at [[Orongokoekoea P\u0101|Orongokoekoea]] on the upper [[Mokau River]], where his wife Whakaawi gave birth to their son T\u0101whiao. Peace was made with Ng\u0101puhi in 1823 and the Waikato re-established themselves on their tribal land.<ref name=dnzb2010/> By the time Ng\u0101puhi re-appeared in the area some ten years later the Waikato had also acquired muskets and could therefore defend themselves successfully.\n\nIn 1831 Te Wherowhero led an immense war party against the Taranaki Maoris and killed many hundreds of the Ngatiawa tribe, whose lands more than ten years later he claimed by right of conquest.<ref name=Mennell/>\n\nBy 1836 Te Wherowhero made peace with the Taranaki tribes.<ref name=dnzb2010/> This occurred at a time when missionaries were having a greater impact upon iwi in the Waikato.

Nor did Te \u0100ti Awa ever entirely abandon their land thereby maintaining their occupation rights. During the latter stages of the war in Taranaki it was the involvement of Waikato warriors in bringing food and war materials (lead and powder) that enabled the Taranaki warriors to keep fighting in the infertile, wet and inhospitable uplands.{{sfn|Keenan|2009|p=?}}\n\n==Treaty and influence with Grey==\nIn March 1840 Te Wherowhero was living at Awhitu in the western [[Manukau Harbour|Manukau]]. [[William Cornwallis Symonds|Captain William Symonds]] brought a copy of the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] to Manukau for chiefs to sign, but Te Wherowhero refused.<ref name=dnzb2010/> However he was friendly towards the colonial government and not opposed to [[P\u0101keh\u0101]] presence in areas he controlled. Initially Te Wherowhero favoured the P\u0101keh\u0101 arrivals in his territory: his daughter, Tiria, married the trader [[John Rodolphus Kent|John Kent]].\n\nIn May 1844 Te Wherowhero hosted a large intertribal gathering at [[Remuera]], near Auckland, with the view mainly of impressing Governor [[Robert FitzRoy]] with the power of the Northern Maoris. He was subsequently received at Government House, Auckland, and treated with great distinction by Fitzroy.<ref name=Mennell/> Te Wherowhero built a house at Pukekawa (in today's [[Auckland Domain]]) and it witnessed many discussions and negotiations concerning the implementation of the Treaty.<ref name=dnzb2010/>\n\nThe Waikato tribes sold land initially; Te Wherowhero sold some tribal land around Manukau. However in 1846 he protested vehemently to Queen Victoria about an edict that land not actually occupied or cultivated by M\u0101ori was to be considered Crown property.<ref name=dnzb2010/>\n\nBetween 1847 and 1852 Governor Grey arranged for 861 retired British soldiers called fencibles and their families to establish a number of military villages at Howick, Panmure, Otahuhu and Onehunga. In April 1849 Te Wherowhero signed an agreement with Governor [[George Edward Grey|George Grey]] to provide [[Auckland]] with military protection on the same basis as the fencibles. 121 Ngati Mahuta -originally from Tamahere, now on the southern outskirts of Hamilton, had British officers but supplied their own weapons. The land they were given by Grey was 80 one acre lots and 80 five acre lots at Mangere. Other chiefs who made the agreement were Kati, Nopora, Kahawai, Ponku,Te Tauke, Rewaite, Hankapanga,Te Katea and Rameka Kiaki (sic). They could be called upon for defence should it become necessary after the violent uprising of M\u0101ori under [[H\u014dne Heke]] and [[Te Ruki Kawiti|Kawiti]]. Grey had learnt the importance of having the support of [[k\u016bpapa]], M\u0101ori who sided with the Crown, during that campaign to restore law and order and assert government authority. During the 1851 attack on Auckland by about 350-450 Ngati Paoa a British regiment, the Onehunga fencibles and HMS Fry defended Auckland at Mechanics Bay with Ngati Mahuta playing no part.<ref>The Royal New Zealand Fencibles 1847\u20131852 .R Alexander.

This was at least partially due to the nature of these arrivals in the Waikato lands, who often encroached on M\u0101ori tribal lands with no formal jurisdiction or consensual purchasing or gifting of the land. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n==M\u0101ori King==\n[[File:Flag of the M\u0101ori King, 1863.jpg|thumb|The flag hoisted at [[Ng\u0101ruaw\u0101hia]] on the proclamation of P\u014dtatau Te Wherowhero as [[M\u0101ori King]], drawn 1863.]]\nIn the early 1850s, a [[M\u0101ori King Movement|movement to establish a M\u0101ori King]] developed.

Iwikau Te Heuheu Tukino III, of Ngati Tuwharetoa, suggested that Te Wherowhero should be approached, and his choice was supported by Wiremu Tamihana, of Ngati Haua.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/128946|title=Te Wherowhero, Potatau|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref>  P\u014dtatau, then elderly, expressed initial reluctance, but agreed in April 1857 at Rangiriri.<ref name=NZHist/> He was installed as king at [[Ngaruawahia]] in June 1858.<ref name=NZHist>{{cite web |url= https://nzhistory.govt.nz/politics/the-maori-king-movement/potatau-te-wherowhero |title=P\u014dtatau Te Wherowhero |date=1 October 2014 |work=NZHistory |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nP\u014dtatau himself wished to continue to work in co-operation with the British Government, but many of his followers adopted a much more independent position. Gradually the two sides polarised and grew apart, culminating five years later in warfare (see [[Invasion of the Waikato]] and [[New Zealand Wars]]).\n\n===Death===\nP\u014dtatau died at Ngaruawahia on 25 June 1860 and is buried on [[Mount Taupiri]], a mountain close to his royal residence in Ngaruawahia.
