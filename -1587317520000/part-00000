Giovanni Caputo of the University of Urbino writes that this phenomenon, which he calls the \"strange-face illusion\", is believed to be a consequence of a \"dissociative identity effect\", which causes the brain's facial-recognition system to misfire in a currently unidentified way.<ref name=\"Caputo\">{{cite journal| last1=Caputo| first1=Giovanni B| year=2010| title=Strange-face-in-the-mirror illusion| journal=Perception | volume=39| issue=7| pages=1007\u20131008| doi=10.1068/p6466| url=http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6466| accessdate=October 18, 2012| pmid=20842976| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025085513/http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6466#| archive-date=2012-10-25| url-status=dead}}</ref> Other possible explanations for the phenomenon include illusions attributed, at least partially, to the perceptual effects of ''[[Troxler's fading]]'',<ref>[http://io9.com/5906432/an-optical-illusion-that-explains-the-origins-of-imaginary-monsters ''An Optical Illusion that Explains the Origins of Imaginary Monsters'']; accessed December 2013.</ref><ref name=\"Caputo\"/> and possibly [[Hypnosis|self-hypnosis]]. The color of the mirror can also have an effect, where silver based mirrors portray a more masculine figure while glass based mirrors portray a feminine figure like most people see.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bloody Mary folklore in popular culture]]\n* [[List of ghosts]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://io9.com/5906432/an-optical-illusion-that-explains-the-origins-of-imaginary-monsters Optical Illusions: Troxler's Fading]\n\n{{Ghosts|state=collapsed}}\n{{Urban legends}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bloody Mary (Folklore)}}\n[[Category:Children's street culture]]\n[[Category:Divination]]\n[[Category:Fictional ghosts]]\n[[Category:Folklore]]\n[[Category:Demons]]\n[[Category:Supernatural legends]]\n[[Category:Urban legends]]\n[[Category:Female legendary creatures]]\n", "name_user": "2605:6000:1519:173a:a5ab:b302:5a3d:4078", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Mary_(folklore)"}

In 1916, an Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] review determined that field clerks should be members of the military. Legislation in 1916 authorized those positions as military rather than civilian and created the ranks of Army Field Clerk (the former rank of Headquarters Clerk) and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk (the former rank of Pay Clerk). In July, 1917, all Field Clerks were considered enlisted and were assigned an enlisted uniform. Their branch insignia was two crossed quill pens (worn on a disk pin on the left side of the standing collar and a freework insignia on the visored cap).\n\nIn 19 December 1917, ''Special Regulation 41'' stated that the Army Field Clerk and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk ranks were authorized the same uniform as an officer. Their rank insignia was now a freework pin of crossed quill pens on either side of the freework \"U.S.\" pins worn on the standing collar of the M1909 tunic. They were not permitted the brown mohair cuff braid band of an Army officer, but were authorized a silver-and-black braid hatcord for wear with the M1911 Campaign Hat and the officer's \"G.I. Eagle\" on the M1902 peaked cap.\n\nOn 9 July 1918, Congress established the rank and grade of warrant officer concurrent with establishing the Army [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS)<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html | The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay</ref> within the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]]. Creation of the Mine Planter Service replaced an informal service crewed by civilians, replacing them with military personnel, of whom the vessel's master, mates, chief engineer, and assistant engineers were Army warrant officers. Warrant officer rank was indicated by rings of brown cord worn on the lower sleeve of the uniform jacket: two for 2nd Mate and 2nd Assistant Engineer, three for 1st Mate and Assistant Engineer, and four for Ship's Master and Chief Engineer.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1941 to 1949\n| width    = 45\n| image1   = FlightOfficerWW2.jpg\n| caption1 = Flight Officer\n| image2   = JuniorWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption2 = Warrant Officer\n| image3   = ChiefWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption3 = Chief Warrant Officer\n}}\n{{anchor|W1|WOJG}}Since that time, the position of warrant officer in the Army has been refined. On 21 August 1941, under {{USPL|77|230}}, Congress authorized two grades: warrant officer (junior grade) and chief warrant officer. In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.\nThe insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, rounded at the ends with brown enamel on top and a latitudinal center of gold {{sfrac|1|8}} (0.32&nbsp;cm) inch wide.

Insignia was the same as for a warrant officer (junior grade), except the backing was in blue enamel rather than brown. Most flight officers were graduates of various USAAF flight-training programs, including power and glider pilots, and navigator and bombardier ratings. Graduates were appointed to the rating of flight officer, but some of each graduating class were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s. Once reaching operational units and after gaining flying experience, flight officers were later offered direct commissions as lieutenants.\n\nFlight sergeants, who were assigned as transport and glider pilots, were appointed as flight officers when the new rank was created. Some of the first eligible flight officers were Americans who had served as sergeant pilots in the [[Royal Air Force]] and who transferred to the USAAF after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nIn November 1942, the War Department defined the rank order as having warrant officers above all enlisted grades and below all commissioned grades. In March 1944, the first six women were appointed to the warrant officer grades as Band Leaders and administrative specialists.\n\nIn 1947, legislation was sought to introduce four grades of warrant officers. Proposed rank titles were: chief warrant officer, senior warrant officer, warrant officer first class, and warrant officer.\n\nIn 1949, {{USPL|81|351}}, the Career Compensation Act, created four pay grades, W-1 through W-4, for all the armed services. The two warrant ranks were unchanged, but warrant officer (junior grade) was pay grade W-1, while chief warrant officer started at W-2 and could advance to W-3 and -4.\n\nIn late 1949, the Warrant Officer Flight Program was created, which trained thousands of warrant officer pilots. The personnel were to be trained by the US Air Force, but controlled by the US Army Transportation Corps. The first helicopter pilot class was 51A (April 1951 to December 1951), which was trained to fly [[Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw|H-19 Chickasaws]]. The program was temporarily cancelled in 1959 due to military budget cuts, but was reinstated in 1963 to meet the increased demand.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1956 to 2004\n| width1   = 45\n| image1   = US Army WO-1 1950-1972.png\n| caption1 = WO1 (1956-1972)\n| width2   = 45\n| image2   = US Army CW-2 1950-1972.png\n| caption2 = CW2 (1956\u20131972)\n| width3   = 45\n| image3   = US Army CW-3 1950-1972.png\n| caption3 = CW3 (1956\u20131972)\n| width4   = 45\n| image4   = US Army CW-4 1950-1972.png\n| caption4 = CW4 (1956-1972)\n| width5   = 41\n| image5   = US-Army-CW5old.svg\n| caption5 = CW5 (1991\u20132004)\n}}\nIn 1954, the Warrant Officer Act, {{USPL|83|379}}, created separate ranks for each pay grade, W-1 through W-4. On 10 September 1956, AR 670-5 authorized the approved insignia for the new ranks that consisted of a metal frame around a brown enamel bar. The insignia for Warrant Officer 1 (Grade W-1) and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (Grade W-2) was a gold metal frame with one or two horizontal metal bands across it. Chief Warrant Officer 3 and Chief Warrant Officer 4 had a silver frame with one or two horizontal bands across it.\n\nDue to the demand for helicopter pilots in Vietnam, the number of warrant officer pilots grew from about 2,960 in 1966 to more than 12,000 by 1970. In 1973, a reduction in force began and chief warrant officer helicopter pilots were offered promotion to the rank of first lieutenant to retain combat veterans.\n\nOn 10 June 1970, the Army adopted a redesigned warrant officer insignia that was easier to identify. It was a silver bar with one to four black enamel squares on it (one per level of rank). \"In July 1972, Army Warrant Officers began wearing the newly designed silver rank insignia, with black squares...\"<ref>[https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_of_Army_WO.htm#1950-1974 \"Army Warrant Officer History 1950\u20131974\"].

Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:\n\na. Warrant officer one (WO1) / chief warrant officer two (CW2): A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1's and CW2's primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS, that is, their area of concentration (officer AOC), or an enlisted rank's military occupational specialty (MOS). Warrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.\n\nb. Chief warrant officer three (CW3): The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army systems. \n \nc. Chief warrant officer four (CW4): The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become more senior, they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into joint and national-level systems. \n \nd. Chief warrant officer five (CW5): The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical experts in their branches and serve at [[brigade]] and higher levels. They also serve as '''Command Chief Warrant Officers (CCWO)'''<ref name= ccwo>[https://www.army.mil/article/227507/smdc_command_chief_warrant_officer_discusses_role  Jason Cutshaw (September 20, 2019) SMDC command chief warrant officer discusses role]</ref> for large commands at the brigade level and higher.\n\nNote: Chief warrant officer six was approved by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 with the anticipation of Congress approving two new grades, W-5 and W-6. However, Congress did not authorize W-5 until 1991 and as of January 2017 has not approved W-6. The original W-5 insignia consisted of a single silver bar superimposed with four equally spaced silver squares with each square bordered in black. In 2004, this insignia was changed to a single silver bar surmounted by a single, narrow, vertical, black stripe. The proposed CW6 insignia had two narrow, vertical, parallel, black stripes.<ref>https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_Army_CW5_Insignia.htm. Retrieved 17 January 2017.

Those appointed would be selected from the noncommissioned officer ranks.\n\nOn 26 August 1916, Congress increased the Marine Corps strength, which included adding the rank of warrant officer; 43 Marine Gunners and 41 Quartermaster Clerks would be appointed. The first Marine Gunner is believed to have been [[Henry L. Hulbert]].<ref>Bevilacqua, Allan C. Major USMC (Ret) ''Henry Lewis Hurlbert-Marine Gunner'' ''Leatherneck'' Dec 2008 Vol XCI No 12</ref> On 22 May 1917, due to commissioned officer shortages, all but three of the appointees were commissioned as temporary second lieutenants. In 1918, the grade of pay clerk was added.\n\nIn June, 1926, Congress created the commissioned warrant grades of Chief Marine Gunner, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Requirements for promotion to chief warrant officer were six years of service as a warrant officer and an examination to qualify.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress abolished the titles of Marine Gunner, Chief Marine Gunner, Quartermaster Clerk, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, Pay Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Instead, they would be designated warrant officer or commissioned warrant officer. In 1943, all Marine warrant officer ranks were aligned with the other services. They were warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer.\n\nThen in 1949, the grade of WO (paygrade W-1) was created for warrant officers and CWO-2, CWO-3, and CWO-4 (paygrades W-2, W-3, and W-4) were created for commissioned warrant officers. In 1954, title \"Chief Warrant Officer\" replaced \"commissioned warrant officer\" for those in grades CWO-2, CWO-3 and CWO-4.\n\nOn 1 February 1992, the grade of CWO-5 (paygrade W-5) was created and those who are appointed serve on the highest unit echelon levels. Only 5% of chief warrant officers occupy this grade.\n\n===Today===\nThe role and purpose of the Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps fulfills the responsibilities as a high-rank 'Subject Matter Expert' within their chosen craft (military occupation specialty [MOS]), and the additional authority of a Commissioned Officer.\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officers commonly provide their respective Marine units and sections, valuable practical experience, and a master level of technical proficiency. Normally, a Unrestricted officer (2ndLt-General) would not have the opportunity to achieve such specialized skills due to their career progression track being more Commander-Centric and less MOS technical as they advance through the ranks.\n\nOnly active-duty enlisted (non-commissioned officers) are accepted into the program. Currently, there are two selection program distinctions, with each its own separate qualifications: administration-oriented or field-oriented.\n\nThe administrative Warrant Officer Selection Program requires a minimum of eight years of active-duty enlistment (not commissioned), proof and/or demonstration of their exceedingly technical proficiency within their MOS field, and achieved the rank and pay grade of Sergeant (E-5) or above.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|header    = U.S. Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officer 'Gunner' insignia\n|width     = 110\n|image1    = USMC CWO Gunner (Dress).png\n|image2    = USMC CWO Gunner (Black).png\n}}\n{{See also|Infantry Weapons Officer}}\n\nHowever, the duties of an [[Infantry Weapons Officer]] is much more demanding. The Infantry Weapons Officer Program requires a minimum of sixteen years in MOS 0300 (Infantry) and achieved at least the rank and grade of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).\n\nWhen either Marine (administrative or field [infantry]) is selected for the program, they are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), conducted at [[The Basic School]], in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name=\"marines\">[http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=677 General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning] 2nd Lt.

This allows the Navy to capitalize on the experience of warrant officers without having to frequently transition them to other duty assignments for advancement.<ref name=\"WO-5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usawoa.org/woheritage//WO_Prog_Other_Svc.htm|title=Warrant Officer Programs of Other Services|publisher=United States Army Warrant Officer Association|accessdate=18 March 2007}}</ref> With the exception of the Navy's short-lived flying chief warrant officer program,<ref name=\"public.navy.mil\">{{cite web|author=&nbsp;|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/BUPERS-NPC/OFFICER/DETAILING/AVIATION/Pages/FLyingCWOProgram.aspx |title=Flying CWO Program |publisher=Public.navy.mil |accessdate=23 July 2014}}</ref> all Navy warrant officers are accessed from the [[Chief petty officer#United States|chief petty officer]] pay grades, E-7 through E-9, analogous to a senior noncommissioned officer in the other services, and must have a minimum 14 years time in service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2016/NAV16144.txt|title=ACTIVE DUTY LIMITED DUTY OFFICER AND CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER IN SERVICE PROCUREMENT BOARDS|work=[[US Navy]]|publisher=[[United States Government]]|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=8 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Background===\nThe Navy has had warrant officers among its ranks since 23 December 1775, when John Berriman received a warrant to act as [[purser]] aboard the [[brigantine]], [[Andrew Doria (1775 brig)|USS ''Andrew Doria'']]. That warrant was considered a patent of trust and honor, but was not considered a commission to command. Since this first appointment, Navy warrant officers have held positions as surgeons, master mates, boatswains, carpenters, and chaplains.<ref name=\"WO-4\" /> Until 1912, a [[midshipman]] graduating from the [[United States Naval Academy]] was required to have two years of sea duty as a warrant officer before receiving a commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref>Commission of ensign to graduates of the Naval Academy at end of four years' course, Pub. Law No. 62-98. 37 Stat. 73 (1912).</ref> Although based on the British [[Royal Navy]] warrant officer ranks that were in place until 1949, the United States had never needed to address an issue of aristocracy, which resulted in warranted officers in the Royal Navy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Naval Officers Guide, 12th ed., L. McComas, US Naval Institute, Annapolis, MD, c2011</ref> However, the United States Navy experienced a similar issue of rank, where highly competent senior noncommissioned officers are required to report to inexperienced junior officers, giving rise to special status to the Navy's chief warrant officers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 1975, the Navy ceased using the rank of warrant officer 1 (WO-1), also known as pay grade W-1, because chief petty officers in pay grades E-7 and above with many years in service would lose pay when appointed to the rank of warrant officer.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The Navy appoints their warrant officers directly to the rank of CWO2 (i.e., as chief warrant officers), and are \"commissioned\" officers, with the Navy Personnel Command/Bureau of Personnel (NAVPERSCOM/BUPERS) managing all grades (CWO-2 through CWO-5) by [[Billet#United States usage|billet]]s appropriate for each rank. In past years, some CWOs resigned their warrant commission prior to retirement to receive greater retirement pay at their former senior enlisted rank.<ref>MILPERSMAN 15560.D, OPNAV 1811.3, OPNAV 1820.1</ref> However, this pay disparity has effectively disappeared in recent years and all Navy CWOs now retire at the appropriate officer grade.\n\n====Flying chief warrant officer====\n[[File:US Navy 090910-N-6651N-007 Chief Warrant Officer Leighton DaCosta performs pre-flight set-up on a P-3 Orion during the platform-specific phase of his Chief Warrant Officer Flight Training program at Patrol Squadron (VP) 30.jpg|thumb|left|250px|CWO2 DaCosta performs pre-flight setup on a [[P-3 Orion|P-3]] during the platform phase of the CWO Flight Training Program, circa 2009]]\nThe Navy started a test program called the \"Flying Chief Warrant Officer Program\" in 2006 to acquire additional [[naval aviator]]s (pilots) and [[naval flight officer]]s (NFOs), who would fly naval aircraft, but who would not compete with traditional [[unrestricted line]] (URL) officers in [[naval aviation]] for eventual command of squadrons, air wings, air stations, etc., the numbers of such commands which had been greatly reduced in the post-[[Cold War]] era, thereby limiting the command opportunity for URL pilots and NFOs.\n\nEnlisted sailors in the grades E-5 through E-7 who had at least an associate degree and were not currently serving in the diver, master-at-arms, nuclear, SEAL, SWCC, or EOD communities were eligible to apply. Upon being commissioned as CWO2, selectees underwent warrant officer indoctrination and then flight school for 18 to 30 months. After completion of flight school, selectees were placed in one of four types of squadrons: Shipbased Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) or Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons, and land-based fixed-wing maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) and fleet air reconnaissance (VQ). These pilots and NFOs were then trained to operate the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion]], the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]], the [[Boeing E-6 Mercury|E-6 Mercury]], or variants of the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Seahawk]]. Those in the VP community would also eventually qualify to fly the [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]] once that aircraft began replacing the P-3 in 2012. The Navy re-evaluated the program in 2011, when the last of the \"flying\" chief warrant officers reported to their operational fleet squadrons and opted to subsequently terminate the program.<ref name=\"WO-5\"/><ref name=\"public.navy.mil\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/navytrng/a/navwarflight.htm |title=Flying CWO Program|accessdate=28 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Reestablishment of warrant officer one ===\n{{Annotated image\n| image = US Navy Cap Devices.png\n| image-width = 380\n| image-left = -29\n| image-top = -270\n| width = 180\n| height = 140\n| float = right\n| annotations =\n| caption = U.S. Navy Warrant Officer\u2013One combination cover device\n}}\nOn 4 June 2018, the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] announced the reestablishment of the rank of warrant officer one (pay grade W-1), for cyber warrant officers, and solicited applications for the rank/grade.<ref name=\"2018-06-04_CNO\">[https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2018/NAV18140.txt  MODIFICATION OF THE NAVY CYBER WARRANT OFFICER PROGRAM], [[Chief of Naval Operations]], 2018-06-04</ref> These warrant officers will receive their appointment via warrant and not via [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]].<ref name=\"2018-06-04_CNO\"/> They will incur a six-year service obligation once promoted to W-1.

The USAF inherited warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947, but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear. When Congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in each of the five services in 1958 (implementing them in 1959-60), Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new \"super grades\" of [[senior master sergeant]] and [[chief master sergeant]] (styling the incumbents as \"[[Air Force Specialty Code#Enlisted AFSCs|superintendents]]\" vice senior or staff NCOICs as does the USA{{not a typo}} and USMC) could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level. This was not publicly acknowledged until years later. The Air Force stopped appointing warrant officers in 1959.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\nThe last active-duty air force chief warrant officer, CWO4 James H. Long, retired in 1980. The last [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]] chief warrant officer, CWO4 Bob Barrow, retired in 1992.

Warrant Officers may serve as officers-in-charge of [[Coast Guard Stations]], or even as Command warrant officers. Chief Warrant officers fill a variety of [[billet#United States usage|billets]] as they can command larger small boat stations and patrol boats, as specialists and supervisors in other technical areas, and as special agents in the [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]]. They wear insignia essentially like that of their Navy counterparts, but with the USCG shield between the rank insignia and the specialty mark, as Coast Guard commissioned officers do with their rank insignia. Like their Navy counterparts, candidates for the rank of chief warrant officer must typically be serving in the chief petty officer grades (E-7 through E-9), however, the Coast Guard also permits selection of first class petty officers (E-6) who are chief petty officer selectees and who are in the top 50% on their advancement list to E-7.  The Coast Guard does not use the rank of warrant officer (WO-1). Although authorized in 1994, the Coast Guard does not currently use or have any active CWO5 grade.<ref>United States Coast Guard.

In 1916, an Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] review determined that field clerks should be members of the military. Legislation in 1916 authorized those positions as military rather than civilian and created the ranks of Army Field Clerk (the former rank of Headquarters Clerk) and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk (the former rank of Pay Clerk). In July, 1917, all Field Clerks were considered enlisted and were assigned an enlisted uniform. Their branch insignia was two crossed quill pens (worn on a disk pin on the left side of the standing collar and a freework insignia on the visored cap).\n\nIn 19 December 1917, ''Special Regulation 41'' stated that the Army Field Clerk and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk ranks were authorized the same uniform as an officer. Their rank insignia was now a freework pin of crossed quill pens on either side of the freework \"U.S.\" pins worn on the standing collar of the M1909 tunic. They were not permitted the brown mohair cuff braid band of an Army officer, but were authorized a silver-and-black braid hatcord for wear with the M1911 Campaign Hat and the officer's \"G.I. Eagle\" on the M1902 peaked cap.\n\nOn 9 July 1918, Congress established the rank and grade of warrant officer concurrent with establishing the Army [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS)<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html | The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay</ref> within the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]]. Creation of the Mine Planter Service replaced an informal service crewed by civilians, replacing them with military personnel, of whom the vessel's master, mates, chief engineer, and assistant engineers were Army warrant officers. Warrant officer rank was indicated by rings of brown cord worn on the lower sleeve of the uniform jacket: two for 2nd Mate and 2nd Assistant Engineer, three for 1st Mate and Assistant Engineer, and four for Ship's Master and Chief Engineer.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1941 to 1949\n| width    = 45\n| image1   = FlightOfficerWW2.jpg\n| caption1 = Flight Officer\n| image2   = JuniorWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption2 = Warrant Officer\n| image3   = ChiefWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption3 = Chief Warrant Officer\n}}\n{{anchor|W1|WOJG}}Since that time, the position of warrant officer in the Army has been refined.

In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.\nThe insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, rounded at the ends with brown enamel on top and a latitudinal center of gold {{sfrac|1|8}} (0.32&nbsp;cm) inch wide. The insignia for chief warrant officer was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} in width and {{convert|1|in|cm}} in length with rounded ends, brown enamel on top with a longitudinal center stripe of gold {{convert|1/8|in|cm}} wide. The brown enamel backing of the warrant officer insignia was based on the color of the sleeve insignia of rank for ship's officers of the AMPS.<ref name=\"WO-1\">{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/wocc/woprogram.asp#history|title=Warrant Officer History|publisher=U.S. Army Warrant Officer Career College|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"tioh_rank\">http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Insignia_Rank/warrant_officers.aspx |Insignia of Grade Warrant - Officers</ref><ref>[http://www.usawoa.org/stivers2announced.htm Ship's officers]</ref>\n\nOn 18 July 1942 {{USPL|77|658}}, the Flight Officer Act, was enacted, creating the rank of [[flight officer]], equivalent to warrant officer (junior grade) and assigned to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Insignia was the same as for a warrant officer (junior grade), except the backing was in blue enamel rather than brown. Most flight officers were graduates of various USAAF flight-training programs, including power and glider pilots, and navigator and bombardier ratings. Graduates were appointed to the rating of flight officer, but some of each graduating class were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s. Once reaching operational units and after gaining flying experience, flight officers were later offered direct commissions as lieutenants.\n\nFlight sergeants, who were assigned as transport and glider pilots, were appointed as flight officers when the new rank was created. Some of the first eligible flight officers were Americans who had served as sergeant pilots in the [[Royal Air Force]] and who transferred to the USAAF after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nIn November 1942, the War Department defined the rank order as having warrant officers above all enlisted grades and below all commissioned grades. In March 1944, the first six women were appointed to the warrant officer grades as Band Leaders and administrative specialists.\n\nIn 1947, legislation was sought to introduce four grades of warrant officers. Proposed rank titles were: chief warrant officer, senior warrant officer, warrant officer first class, and warrant officer.\n\nIn 1949, {{USPL|81|351}}, the Career Compensation Act, created four pay grades, W-1 through W-4, for all the armed services. The two warrant ranks were unchanged, but warrant officer (junior grade) was pay grade W-1, while chief warrant officer started at W-2 and could advance to W-3 and -4.\n\nIn late 1949, the Warrant Officer Flight Program was created, which trained thousands of warrant officer pilots. The personnel were to be trained by the US Air Force, but controlled by the US Army Transportation Corps. The first helicopter pilot class was 51A (April 1951 to December 1951), which was trained to fly [[Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw|H-19 Chickasaws]]. The program was temporarily cancelled in 1959 due to military budget cuts, but was reinstated in 1963 to meet the increased demand.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1956 to 2004\n| width1   = 45\n| image1   = US Army WO-1 1950-1972.png\n| caption1 = WO1 (1956-1972)\n| width2   = 45\n| image2   = US Army CW-2 1950-1972.png\n| caption2 = CW2 (1956\u20131972)\n| width3   = 45\n| image3   = US Army CW-3 1950-1972.png\n| caption3 = CW3 (1956\u20131972)\n| width4   = 45\n| image4   = US Army CW-4 1950-1972.png\n| caption4 = CW4 (1956-1972)\n| width5   = 41\n| image5   = US-Army-CW5old.svg\n| caption5 = CW5 (1991\u20132004)\n}}\nIn 1954, the Warrant Officer Act, {{USPL|83|379}}, created separate ranks for each pay grade, W-1 through W-4. On 10 September 1956, AR 670-5 authorized the approved insignia for the new ranks that consisted of a metal frame around a brown enamel bar. The insignia for Warrant Officer 1 (Grade W-1) and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (Grade W-2) was a gold metal frame with one or two horizontal metal bands across it. Chief Warrant Officer 3 and Chief Warrant Officer 4 had a silver frame with one or two horizontal bands across it.\n\nDue to the demand for helicopter pilots in Vietnam, the number of warrant officer pilots grew from about 2,960 in 1966 to more than 12,000 by 1970. In 1973, a reduction in force began and chief warrant officer helicopter pilots were offered promotion to the rank of first lieutenant to retain combat veterans.\n\nOn 10 June 1970, the Army adopted a redesigned warrant officer insignia that was easier to identify. It was a silver bar with one to four black enamel squares on it (one per level of rank). \"In July 1972, Army Warrant Officers began wearing the newly designed silver rank insignia, with black squares...\"<ref>[https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_of_Army_WO.htm#1950-1974 \"Army Warrant Officer History 1950\u20131974\"].

Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:\n\na. Warrant officer one (WO1) / chief warrant officer two (CW2): A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1's and CW2's primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS, that is, their area of concentration (officer AOC), or an enlisted rank's military occupational specialty (MOS). Warrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.\n\nb. Chief warrant officer three (CW3): The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army systems. \n \nc. Chief warrant officer four (CW4): The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become more senior, they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into joint and national-level systems. \n \nd. Chief warrant officer five (CW5): The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical experts in their branches and serve at [[brigade]] and higher levels. They also serve as '''Command Chief Warrant Officers (CCWO)'''<ref name= ccwo>[https://www.army.mil/article/227507/smdc_command_chief_warrant_officer_discusses_role  Jason Cutshaw (September 20, 2019) SMDC command chief warrant officer discusses role]</ref> for large commands at the brigade level and higher.\n\nNote: Chief warrant officer six was approved by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 with the anticipation of Congress approving two new grades, W-5 and W-6. However, Congress did not authorize W-5 until 1991 and as of January 2017 has not approved W-6. The original W-5 insignia consisted of a single silver bar superimposed with four equally spaced silver squares with each square bordered in black. In 2004, this insignia was changed to a single silver bar surmounted by a single, narrow, vertical, black stripe. The proposed CW6 insignia had two narrow, vertical, parallel, black stripes.<ref>https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_Army_CW5_Insignia.htm. Retrieved 17 January 2017.

Those appointed would be selected from the noncommissioned officer ranks.\n\nOn 26 August 1916, Congress increased the Marine Corps strength, which included adding the rank of warrant officer; 43 Marine Gunners and 41 Quartermaster Clerks would be appointed. The first Marine Gunner is believed to have been [[Henry L. Hulbert]].<ref>Bevilacqua, Allan C. Major USMC (Ret) ''Henry Lewis Hurlbert-Marine Gunner'' ''Leatherneck'' Dec 2008 Vol XCI No 12</ref> On 22 May 1917, due to commissioned officer shortages, all but three of the appointees were commissioned as temporary second lieutenants. In 1918, the grade of pay clerk was added.\n\nIn June, 1926, Congress created the commissioned warrant grades of Chief Marine Gunner, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Requirements for promotion to chief warrant officer were six years of service as a warrant officer and an examination to qualify.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress abolished the titles of Marine Gunner, Chief Marine Gunner, Quartermaster Clerk, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, Pay Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Instead, they would be designated warrant officer or commissioned warrant officer. In 1943, all Marine warrant officer ranks were aligned with the other services. They were warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer.\n\nThen in 1949, the grade of WO (paygrade W-1) was created for warrant officers and CWO-2, CWO-3, and CWO-4 (paygrades W-2, W-3, and W-4) were created for commissioned warrant officers. In 1954, title \"Chief Warrant Officer\" replaced \"commissioned warrant officer\" for those in grades CWO-2, CWO-3 and CWO-4.\n\nOn 1 February 1992, the grade of CWO-5 (paygrade W-5) was created and those who are appointed serve on the highest unit echelon levels. Only 5% of chief warrant officers occupy this grade.\n\n===Today===\nThe role and purpose of the Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps fulfills the responsibilities as a high-rank 'Subject Matter Expert' within their chosen craft (military occupation specialty [MOS]), and the additional authority of a Commissioned Officer.\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officers commonly provide their respective Marine units and sections, valuable practical experience, and a master level of technical proficiency. Normally, a Unrestricted officer (2ndLt-General) would not have the opportunity to achieve such specialized skills due to their career progression track being more Commander-Centric and less MOS technical as they advance through the ranks.\n\nOnly active-duty enlisted (non-commissioned officers) are accepted into the program. Currently, there are two selection program distinctions, with each its own separate qualifications: administration-oriented or field-oriented.\n\nThe administrative Warrant Officer Selection Program requires a minimum of eight years of active-duty enlistment (not commissioned), proof and/or demonstration of their exceedingly technical proficiency within their MOS field, and achieved the rank and pay grade of Sergeant (E-5) or above.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|header    = U.S. Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officer 'Gunner' insignia\n|width     = 110\n|image1    = USMC CWO Gunner (Dress).png\n|image2    = USMC CWO Gunner (Black).png\n}}\n{{See also|Infantry Weapons Officer}}\n\nHowever, the duties of an [[Infantry Weapons Officer]] is much more demanding. The Infantry Weapons Officer Program requires a minimum of sixteen years in MOS 0300 (Infantry) and achieved at least the rank and grade of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).\n\nWhen either Marine (administrative or field [infantry]) is selected for the program, they are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), conducted at [[The Basic School]], in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name=\"marines\">[http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=677 General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning] 2nd Lt.

Upon being commissioned as CWO2, selectees underwent warrant officer indoctrination and then flight school for 18 to 30 months. After completion of flight school, selectees were placed in one of four types of squadrons: Shipbased Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) or Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons, and land-based fixed-wing maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) and fleet air reconnaissance (VQ). These pilots and NFOs were then trained to operate the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion]], the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]], the [[Boeing E-6 Mercury|E-6 Mercury]], or variants of the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Seahawk]].

The USAF inherited warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947, but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear. When Congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in each of the five services in 1958 (implementing them in 1959-60), Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new \"super grades\" of [[senior master sergeant]] and [[chief master sergeant]] (styling the incumbents as \"[[Air Force Specialty Code#Enlisted AFSCs|superintendents]]\" vice senior or staff NCOICs as does the USA{{not a typo}} and USMC) could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level. This was not publicly acknowledged until years later. The Air Force stopped appointing warrant officers in 1959.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\nThe last active-duty air force chief warrant officer, CWO4 James H. Long, retired in 1980. The last [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]] chief warrant officer, CWO4 Bob Barrow, retired in 1992. Upon his retirement, Barrow was honorarily promoted to CWO5, the only person in the Air Force ever to hold this grade.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\n==Coast Guard==\n[[File:US Coast Guard Warrant Officer Specialty Markings-Collar.png|thumb|425px|U.S. Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer specialty insignia (collar devices)]] Due to the small and decentralized nature of the service, Coast Guard Warrant Officers often fill command roles. Warrant Officers may serve as officers-in-charge of [[Coast Guard Stations]], or even as Command warrant officers. Chief Warrant officers fill a variety of [[billet#United States usage|billets]] as they can command larger small boat stations and patrol boats, as specialists and supervisors in other technical areas, and as special agents in the [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]]. They wear insignia essentially like that of their Navy counterparts, but with the USCG shield between the rank insignia and the specialty mark, as Coast Guard commissioned officers do with their rank insignia. Like their Navy counterparts, candidates for the rank of chief warrant officer must typically be serving in the chief petty officer grades (E-7 through E-9), however, the Coast Guard also permits selection of first class petty officers (E-6) who are chief petty officer selectees and who are in the top 50% on their advancement list to E-7.  The Coast Guard does not use the rank of warrant officer (WO-1). Although authorized in 1994, the Coast Guard does not currently use or have any active CWO5 grade.<ref>United States Coast Guard.

The story is about a small music band conducted by [[Mickey Mouse]] which struggles through a distraction-filled public performance.\n\n''The Band Concert'' was directed by [[Wilfred Jackson]] and featured adapted music by [[Leigh Harline]]. The only speaking character in the film is [[Donald Duck]] who is performed by voice actor [[Clarence Nash]].<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0026094|title=The Band Concert}}</ref><ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1935/bandconcert.html ''The Band Concert''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820045534/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1935/bandconcert.html |date=2006-08-20 }} at The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''[[File:The Band Concert.png|thumb|Title Card]]''\nMickey Mouse's concert band is performing a concert in a [[park]]. As the film opens, they are being applauded for having just played music from [[Louis Joseph Ferdinand H\u00e9rold]]'s ''[[Zampa]]''. They next begin [[Gioacchino Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture|''William Tell'' overture]].<ref>The overture was significantly abridged to account for events in the film. It was also played out of order, starting with the \"Finale\" (the \"[[Lone Ranger#Music|Lone Ranger]]\" segment), continuing with the ''[[Ranz des Vaches]]'' \"Daybreak\" movement, and ending with the \"Prelude\" and \"Storm\" movements.</ref>\n\nMickey's performance is first disrupted by Peter Pig's [[vibrato]] trumpet and Paddy Pig's tuba playing ''Prelude: Dawn''. Meanwhile, [[Donald Duck]] rolls a vendor cart through the audience selling lemonade, popcorn, and ice cream, which further distracts Mickey.\n\nWhile the band is playing the \"Finale\" segment, Donald plays ''[[Turkey in the Straw]]'' at the same tempo as the band. Overhearing Donald, the entire band absent-mindedly find themselves playing Donald's song. Realizing that he accidentally switched genres, Mickey loses his temper over his performance being disrupted in this manner. Mickey breaks Donald's flute in two, only for Donald to get another one out. They play the song again and Mickey breaks the flute once more. The band resumes the segment, but when Donald pulls out a third flute and plays \"Turkey in the Straw\" again, Donald breaks the flute himself before Mickey can. The trombonist grabs Donald by the neck, shakes out several of his flutes and forces him offstage, knocking him back into the vendor cart.\n\nWhile Donald tries to play the song again a bee harasses him. When the bee lands on Mickey's hat, Donald throws ice cream at the bee, which sends it into Peter Pig's trumpet; he shoots it out, accidentally hitting Mickey with it. The ice cream slides under Mickey's uniform, making him shake around, causing the band to briefly play ''[[The Streets of Cairo, or the Poor Little Country Maid|The Streets of Cairo]]'' until it falls out and he kicks it away. Mickey has the band play ''[[Ranz des Vaches]]'' and loses his temper when the bee interrupts the performance, swatting his baton at the bee and thus causing the band to briefly play notes drastically different than the song. Percussionist [[Horace Horsecollar]] tries to kill the bee by squishing it with his cymbals and with a hammer, but accidentally hits Goofy's head instead, driving his head down into his jacket. He continues playing his clarinet from inside it while Horace leaves in shame.\n\nWhen the band comes to the \"Storm\" segment of the overture, it summons an actual [[tornado]], prompting the audience and Donald to run away. The benches that the audience members were sitting on come to life (each wearing a hat that fell off an audience member) and also begin running for their lives as well. Donald tries to take shelter in some trees only for the tornado to tie them in knots with Donald in the middle. The tornado sucks up and destroys everything in its path (houses, farms, trees, walls, signs, windmills, fences, power lines, etc), even the [[pavilion]] on which the band is playing, but the band is so used to the distractions by this point that they continue to play from inside the tornado (in which Mickey floats through the remains of a wrecked house, Peter Pig gets spanked by a fence, and Clarabelle is hit by a pair of undergarments and an umbrella that turns her flute inside-out). The tornado suddenly freezes when Mickey takes a pause conducting (which seemingly stops time itself briefly) and goes in reverse as the band finishes the last part of the song. As the storm passes, the band (except Horace, Peter Pig and Mickey) is thrown into a tree and they finish the overture. Yet by this time, the only remaining audience member is Donald Duck (who somehow managed to untangle himself from the twisted trees) who applauds enthusiastically. Witnessing Donald playing \"Turkey in the Straw\" as an encore, the offscreen band members end the show by throwing their instruments at him in disgust.\n\n==The Band==\n*[[Mickey Mouse]] - [[Conducting|Conductor]]\n*[[Goofy]] - [[Clarinet]]\n*Unnamed Dog <ref>Appeared as [[Mickey Mouse universe#Gideon Goat|Gideon Goat]] in promotional materials ([http://d23.disney.go.com/articles/022510_NF_FEAT_BandConcert.html])</ref> - [[Trombone]]\n*[[Clarabelle Cow]] - [[Western concert flute|Flute]]\n*[[Horace Horsecollar]] - [[Percussion instrument|Percussion]]\n*[[Peter Pig]] - [[Trumpet]]\n*[[Paddy Pig]] - [[Tuba]]\n\n==Cast==\n*[[mel blanc]] as [[Donald Duck]]\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough ''The Band Concert'' did not receive any Academy Award nominations, it has nonetheless become one of the most highly acclaimed Disney short films.

''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination''. [[Vintage Books|Vintage]]: New York. 2007. page 195.</ref>\n\nIn ''The Disney Films'', [[Leonard Maltin]] said that ''The Band Concert'' is \"one of the best cartoons ever made anywhere... There are nuances of expression in Mickey's character throughout this film that had seldom been explored in earlier shorts. The pacing is also entirely different from the standard Mickey Mouse comedies of the early thirties.

The only speaking character in the film is [[Donald Duck]] who is performed by voice actor [[Clarence Nash]].<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0026094|title=The Band Concert}}</ref><ref>[http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1935/bandconcert.html ''The Band Concert''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820045534/http://www.disneyshorts.org/years/1935/bandconcert.html |date=2006-08-20 }} at The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n''[[File:The Band Concert.png|thumb|Title Card]]''\nMickey Mouse's concert band is performing a concert in a [[park]]. As the film opens, they are being applauded for having just played music from [[Louis Joseph Ferdinand H\u00e9rold]]'s ''[[Zampa]]''. They next begin [[Gioacchino Rossini]]'s [[William Tell Overture|''William Tell'' overture]].<ref>The overture was significantly abridged to account for events in the film. It was also played out of order, starting with the \"Finale\" (the \"[[Lone Ranger#Music|Lone Ranger]]\" segment), continuing with the ''[[Ranz des Vaches]]'' \"Daybreak\" movement, and ending with the \"Prelude\" and \"Storm\" movements.</ref>\n\nMickey's performance is first disrupted by Peter Pig's [[vibrato]] trumpet and Paddy Pig's tuba playing ''Prelude: Dawn''. Meanwhile, [[Donald Duck]] rolls a vendor cart through the audience selling lemonade, popcorn, and ice cream, which further distracts Mickey.\n\nWhile the band is playing the \"Finale\" segment, Donald plays ''[[Turkey in the Straw]]'' at the same tempo as the band. Overhearing Donald, the entire band absent-mindedly find themselves playing Donald's song. Realizing that he accidentally switched genres, Mickey loses his temper over his performance being disrupted in this manner. Mickey breaks Donald's flute in two, only for Donald to get another one out. They play the song again and Mickey breaks the flute once more. The band resumes the segment, but when Donald pulls out a third flute and plays \"Turkey in the Straw\" again, Donald breaks the flute himself before Mickey can. The trombonist grabs Donald by the neck, shakes out several of his flutes and forces him offstage, knocking him back into the vendor cart.\n\nWhile Donald tries to play the song again a bee harasses him. When the bee lands on Mickey's hat, Donald throws ice cream at the bee, which sends it into Peter Pig's trumpet; he shoots it out, accidentally hitting Mickey with it. The ice cream slides under Mickey's uniform, making him shake around, causing the band to briefly play ''[[The Streets of Cairo, or the Poor Little Country Maid|The Streets of Cairo]]'' until it falls out and he kicks it away. Mickey has the band play ''[[Ranz des Vaches]]'' and loses his temper when the bee interrupts the performance, swatting his baton at the bee and thus causing the band to briefly play notes drastically different than the song. Percussionist [[Horace Horsecollar]] tries to kill the bee by squishing it with his cymbals and with a hammer, but accidentally hits Goofy's head instead, driving his head down into his jacket. He continues playing his clarinet from inside it while Horace leaves in shame.\n\nWhen the band comes to the \"Storm\" segment of the overture, it summons an actual [[tornado]], prompting the audience and Donald to run away. The benches that the audience members were sitting on come to life (each wearing a hat that fell off an audience member) and also begin running for their lives as well. Donald tries to take shelter in some trees only for the tornado to tie them in knots with Donald in the middle. The tornado sucks up and destroys everything in its path (houses, farms, trees, walls, signs, windmills, fences, power lines, etc), even the [[pavilion]] on which the band is playing, but the band is so used to the distractions by this point that they continue to play from inside the tornado (in which Mickey floats through the remains of a wrecked house, Peter Pig gets spanked by a fence, and Clarabelle is hit by a pair of undergarments and an umbrella that turns her flute inside-out). The tornado suddenly freezes when Mickey takes a pause conducting (which seemingly stops time itself briefly) and goes in reverse as the band finishes the last part of the song. As the storm passes, the band (except Horace, Peter Pig and Mickey) is thrown into a tree and they finish the overture. Yet by this time, the only remaining audience member is Donald Duck (who somehow managed to untangle himself from the twisted trees) who applauds enthusiastically. Witnessing Donald playing \"Turkey in the Straw\" as an encore, the offscreen band members end the show by throwing their instruments at him in disgust.\n\n==The Band==\n*[[Mickey Mouse]] - [[Conducting|Conductor]]\n*[[Goofy]] - [[Clarinet]]\n*Unnamed Dog <ref>Appeared as [[Mickey Mouse universe#Gideon Goat|Gideon Goat]] in promotional materials ([http://d23.disney.go.com/articles/022510_NF_FEAT_BandConcert.html])</ref> - [[Trombone]]\n*[[Clarabelle Cow]] - [[Western concert flute|Flute]]\n*[[Horace Horsecollar]] - [[Percussion instrument|Percussion]]\n*[[Peter Pig]] - [[Trumpet]]\n*[[Paddy Pig]] - [[Tuba]]\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Clarence Nash]] as [[Donald Duck]]\n\n==Reception==\nAlthough ''The Band Concert'' did not receive any Academy Award nominations, it has nonetheless become one of the most highly acclaimed Disney short films. [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'' magazine]] cultural critic [[Gilbert Seldes]] wrote that \"[none of] dozens of works produced in America at the same time in all the other arts can stand comparison with this one.\" The Italian conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] was such a fan of ''The Band Concert'' that he saw it six times in the theater and later invited Walt Disney to his home in Italy.<ref>[[Neal Gabler|Gabler, Neal]]. ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination''. [[Vintage Books|Vintage]]: New York. 2007. page 195.</ref>\n\nIn ''The Disney Films'', [[Leonard Maltin]] said that ''The Band Concert'' is \"one of the best cartoons ever made anywhere... There are nuances of expression in Mickey's character throughout this film that had seldom been explored in earlier shorts. The pacing is also entirely different from the standard Mickey Mouse comedies of the early thirties. Instead of trying to pack in a thousand gags a minute, ''The Band Concert'' takes its time and builds to a crescendo.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Maltin |first1=Leonard |title=The Disney Films |date=1984 |publisher=Crown Publishers |isbn=0-517-55407-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/disneyfilms00malt/page/294 294] |edition=2nd |url=https://archive.org/details/disneyfilms00malt |url-access=registration |accessdate=15 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, ''The Band Concert'' was rated third in the book ''[[The 50 Greatest Cartoons]]'', which rated the greatest cartoons of all time by members of the field of animation.<ref>Beck, Jerry (1994), ''50 Greatest Cartoons, The.''  Atlanta: Turner Publishing Inc., pg 41. 1-878685-49-X</ref> As a result, it was the highest-ranked Disney cartoon on the list, and the only one in the top 5 not produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons]].\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Disney On Parade (2042369783).jpg|thumb|right|[[Disney on Parade]] inflatable of Mickey from ''The Band Concert'', pictured in 2007]]\nAccording to [[Leonard Maltin]], the 1942 ''Mickey Mouse'' film ''[[Symphony Hour]]'' was somewhat of a remake of ''The Band Concert''.\n\nIn the 1942 wartime cartoon, ''All Together'', Mickey and his whole band from the cartoon is seen in the parade.\n\nIn the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'', in the Garden area of Disney Castle, there is a [[topiary]] sculpture of all characters in the band besides Mickey, Donald, and Goofy.\n\n''The Band Concert'' was also the basis for, and title of the secret level in the game, ''[[Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse]]'' (in the [[Sega Genesis]]/[[Mega Drive]], [[Sega CD]] and [[PlayStation]] versions only).\n\nThis cartoon was also the inspiration for the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] [[Magic Kingdom]] show [[Mickey's PhilharMagic]].\n\nThe short was one of the many featured in ''[[Donald Duck's 50th Birthday]]'', Donald remembers it in a [[psychiatric]] session with Dr. [[Ludwig Von Drake]] and says that Mickey \"invited\" Donald to play with his band.\n\n''The Band Concert'' is the theme for the [[Silly Symphony Swings]] attraction at [[Disney California Adventure|Disney California Adventure Park]].\n\nThis cartoon was featured in ''[[Disney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey Mouse]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mickey Mouse (film series)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{bcdb title|4146}}\n*{{IMDb title|26094}}\n{{Mickey Mouse cartoons}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Band Concert, The}}\n[[Category:1935 animated films]]\n[[Category:1930s color films]]\n[[Category:Disney animated short films, 1930s]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Films about music and musicians]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Wilfred Jackson]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Walt Disney]]\n[[Category:Mickey Mouse short films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Leigh Harline]]\n", "name_user": "2601:4a:857f:650:c418:87c1:bd67:55", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eCast)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band_Concert"}
