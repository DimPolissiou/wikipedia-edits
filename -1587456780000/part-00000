Antimicrobial peptides may also function as metabolic inhibitors, inhibitors of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibitors of cell wall synthesis or septum formation. They are also known to cause ribosomal aggregation and delocalize membrane proteins.\n\nAdding a further layer of complexity, many natural antimicrobial peptides possess weak bactericidal activity. Rather than directly inhibit bacterial growth, they are now known to act in concert with the host immune system through mechanisms including chemokine induction, histamine release, and angiogenesis modulation.

Since the surface of the bacterial membranes is more negatively charged than mammalian cells, antimicrobial peptides will show different affinities towards the bacterial membranes and mammalian cell membranes.<ref name=\"Hancock_2006\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hancock RE, Sahl HG | title = Antimicrobial and host-defense peptides as new anti-infective therapeutic strategies | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 24 | issue = 12 | pages = 1551\u20137 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17160061 | doi = 10.1038/nbt1267 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, there are also other factors that will affect the selectivity. It's well known that [[cholesterol]] is normally widely distributed in the mammalian cell membranes as a membrane stabilizing agents but absent in bacterial cell membranes; and the presence of these cholesterols will also generally reduce the activities of the antimicrobial peptides, due either to stabilization of the lipid bilayer or to interactions between cholesterol and the peptide. So the cholesterol in mammalian cells will protect the cells from attack by the antimicrobial peptides.<ref name=\"Zasloff_2002\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zasloff M | title = Antimicrobial peptides of multicellular organisms | journal = Nature | volume = 415 | issue = 6870 | pages = 389\u201395 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11807545 | doi = 10.1038/415389a | bibcode = 2002Natur.415..389Z }}\n</ref>\n\nBesides, the [[transmembrane potential]] is well known to affect peptide-lipid interactions.<ref name=\"Matsuzaki_1995\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsuzaki K, Sugishita K, Fujii N, Miyajima K | title = Molecular basis for membrane selectivity of an antimicrobial peptide, magainin 2 | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 34 | issue = 10 | pages = 3423\u20139 | date = March 1995 | pmid = 7533538 | doi = 10.1021/bi00010a034 }}</ref> There's an inside-negative transmembrane potential existing from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet of the cell membranes and this inside-negative transmembrane potential will facilitate membrane permeabilization probably by facilitating the insertion of positively charged peptides into membranes. By comparison, the transmembrane potential of bacterial cells is more negative than that of normal mammalian cells, so bacterial membrane will be prone to be attacked by the positively charged antimicrobial peptides.\n\nSimilarly, it is also believed that increasing [[ionic strength]],<ref name=\"Zasloff_2002\"/> which in general reduces the activity of most antimicrobial peptides, contributes partially to the selectivity of the antimicrobial peptides by weakening the [[electrostatic interactions]] required for the initial interaction.\n\n[[Image:Mechanim of Selectivity of Antimicrobial Peptides.jpg|Molecular Basis of Cell Selectivity of Antimicrobial Peptides|right|thumb|400px]]\n\n===Mechanism===\nThe cell membranes of bacteria are rich in acidic [[phospholipids]], such as [[phosphatidylglycerol]] and [[cardiolipin]].<ref name=\"Matsuzaki_2009\"/><ref name=\"Chou_2008\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chou HT, Kuo TY, Chiang JC, Pei MJ, Yang WT, Yu HC, Lin SB, Chen WJ | title = Design and synthesis of cationic antimicrobial peptides with improved activity and selectivity against Vibrio spp | journal = International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 130\u20138 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18586467 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2008.04.003 }}</ref> These phospholipid headgroups are heavily negatively charged. Therefore, the outmost leaflets of the bilayer which is exposed to the outside of the bacterial membranes are more attractive to the attack of the positively charged antimicrobial peptides. So the interaction between the positive charges of antimicrobial peptides and the negatively charged bacterial membranes is mainly the electrostatic interactions, which is the major driving force for cellular association. In addition, since antimicrobial peptides form structures with a positively charged face as well as a hydrophobic face, there are also some hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic regions of the antimicrobial peptides and the [[zwitterion]]ic phospholipids (electrically neutral) surface of the bacterial membranes, which act only as a minor effect in this case.\n\nIn contrast, the outer part of the membranes of plants and mammals is mainly composed of lipids without any net charges since most of the lipids with negatively charged headgroups are principally sequestered into the inner leaflet of the plasma membranes.<ref name=\"Hancock_2006\"/> Thus in the case of mammalian cells, the outer surfaces of the membranes are usually made of zwitterionic [[phosphatidylcholine]] and [[sphingomyelin]], even though a small portion of the membrane's outer surfaces contain some negatively charged [[gangliosides]]. Therefore, the hydrophobic interaction between the hydrophobic face of amphipathic antimicrobial peptides and the zwitterionic phospholipids on the cell surface of mammalian cell membranes plays a major role in the formation of peptide-cell binding.<ref name = \"Tennessen_2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tennessen JA | title = Molecular evolution of animal antimicrobial peptides: widespread moderate positive selection | journal = Journal of Evolutionary Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 1387\u201394 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16313451 | doi = 10.1111/j.1420-9101.2005.00925.x }}</ref> However, the hydrophobic interaction is relatively weak when compared to the electrostatic interaction, thus, the antimicrobial peptides will preferentially interact with bacterial membranes.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n[[Dual polarisation interferometry]] has been used ''in vitro'' to study and quantify the association to headgroup, insertion into the bilayer, pore formation and eventual disruption of the membrane.<ref name = \"Yu_2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu L, Guo L, Ding JL, Ho B, Feng SS, Popplewell J, Swann M, Wohland T | title = Interaction of an artificial antimicrobial peptide with lipid membranes | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes| volume = 1788 | issue = 2 | pages = 333\u201344 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19013127 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbamem.2008.10.005 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid19400207\">{{cite book | vauthors = Lee TH, Hall K, Mechler A, Martin L, Popplewell J, Ronan G, Aguilar MI | title = Molecular imaging and orientational changes of antimicrobial peptides in membranes | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 611 | issue = | pages = 313\u20135 | date = 2009 | pmid = 19400207 | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-73657-0_140 | isbn = 978-0-387-73656-3 | bibcode = 2009peyo.book..313L }}</ref>\n\n===Control===\nA lot of effort has been put into controlling cell selectivity.

Once inside the membrane, they are believed to cause disruption through three possible [[mechanism of action|mechanisms]]:\n\n* toroidal pore formation\n* carpet formation\n* barrel stave formation\n\nAlthough the specifics of each mechanism differ, all propose peptide-induced membrane rupture, allowing cytoplasmic leakage that ultimately leads to death.\n\nRecent work has painted a more complex picture of antimicrobial peptide activity. Antimicrobial peptides may also function as metabolic inhibitors, inhibitors of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibitors of cell wall synthesis or septum formation. They are also known to cause ribosomal aggregation and delocalize membrane proteins.\n\nAdding a further layer of complexity, many natural antimicrobial peptides possess weak bactericidal activity. Rather than directly inhibit bacterial growth, they are now known to act in concert with the host immune system through mechanisms including chemokine induction, histamine release, and angiogenesis modulation. These immunomodulatory effects have only recently begun to receive attention.\n\nSeveral methods have been used to determine the mechanisms of antimicrobial peptide activity.<ref name=\"pmid23183933\"/><ref name=\"Brogden|_2005\"/> In particular, [[solid-state NMR]] studies have provided an atomic-level resolution explanation of membrane disruption by antimicrobial peptides.<ref name = \"Hallock_2003\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hallock KJ, Lee DK, Ramamoorthy A | title = MSI-78, an analogue of the magainin antimicrobial peptides, disrupts lipid bilayer structure via positive curvature strain | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 84 | issue = 5 | pages = 3052\u201360 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12719236 | pmc = 1302867 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(03)70031-9 | bibcode = 2003BpJ....84.3052H }}</ref><ref name = \"Henzler_2003\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Henzler Wildman KA, Lee DK, Ramamoorthy A | title = Mechanism of lipid bilayer disruption by the human antimicrobial peptide, LL-37 | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 42 | issue = 21 | pages = 6545\u201358 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12767238 | doi = 10.1021/bi0273563 }}</ref> In more recent years, [[X-ray crystallography]] has been used to delineate in atomic detail how the family of [[plant defensin]]s rupture membranes by identifying key phospholipids in the cell membranes of the pathogen.<ref name = \"J\u00e4rv\u00e5_1962\">{{cite journal | vauthors = J\u00e4rv\u00e5 M, Lay FT, Phan TK, Humble C, Poon IK, Bleackley MR, Anderson MA, Hulett MD, Kvansakul M | title = X-ray structure of a carpet-like antimicrobial defensin-phospholipid membrane disruption complex | language = En | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1962 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29773800 | pmc = 5958116 | doi = 10.1038/s41467-018-04434-y | bibcode = 2018NatCo...9.1962J }}</ref><ref name = \"Poon_2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Poon IK, Baxter AA, Lay FT, Mills GD, Adda CG, Payne JA, Phan TK, Ryan GF, White JA, Veneer PK, van der Weerden NL, Anderson MA, Kvansakul M, Hulett MD | title = Phosphoinositide-mediated oligomerization of a defensin induces cell lysis | journal = eLife | volume = 3 | pages = e01808 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24692446 | pmc = 3968744 | doi = 10.7554/elife.01808 }}</ref> Human defensins have been thought to act through a similar mechanism, targeting cell membrane lipids as part of their function.

So the interaction between the positive charges of antimicrobial peptides and the negatively charged bacterial membranes is mainly the electrostatic interactions, which is the major driving force for cellular association. In addition, since antimicrobial peptides form structures with a positively charged face as well as a hydrophobic face, there are also some hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic regions of the antimicrobial peptides and the [[zwitterion]]ic phospholipids (electrically neutral) surface of the bacterial membranes, which act only as a minor effect in this case.\n\nIn contrast, the outer part of the membranes of plants and mammals is mainly composed of lipids without any net charges since most of the lipids with negatively charged headgroups are principally sequestered into the inner leaflet of the plasma membranes.<ref name=\"Hancock_2006\"/> Thus in the case of mammalian cells, the outer surfaces of the membranes are usually made of zwitterionic [[phosphatidylcholine]] and [[sphingomyelin]], even though a small portion of the membrane's outer surfaces contain some negatively charged [[gangliosides]].

He offers to marry her, but she decides they are not suited for each other. Instead, she marries steady local Elmer Croy. Pierre gives her all his money for their child.\n\nPierre hates the circus life, so when his friend Henry Mueller ([[Hobart Cavanaugh]]) approaches him to become his partner in a bicycle shop, he jumps at the chance to establish a new life in the United States, despite the disapproval of his alcoholic mother, Madame Azais ([[Marjorie Rambeau]]). To raise his share of the money needed to start the venture, he turns to wealthy young widow Leah Ernst ([[Florence Eldridge]]), who is attracted to him.\n\nThe shop is a success, but Pierre's ambitions are only whetted. He persuades his partner to branch out into newfangled automobiles. They spend several years building a new car. By a stroke of luck, the automobile of Homer Flint ([[Arthur Hohl]]), the richest man in the state, breaks down near their shop. He is interested in mass-producing their car. Pierre becomes a hardworking business partner of Flint's and becomes engaged to Flint's daughter, Hazel ([[Dorothy Burgess]]). \n\nOne day, when the couple goes golfing, Pierre, now an American citizen calling himself Paul Rader, discovers that the young boy who wants to caddy for him is his son, Pierre Croy. Paul begins a relationship with the boy as a benefactor. Later, with his marriage unhappy and childless, Paul asks to adopt Pierre. Joanna flatly refuses but consents to allowing Paul to finance Pierre's education at an elite boarding school once Pierre is older.  \n\nYears later, on a trip to New York to escort Pierre to his new school, Paul starts an affair with Lady Claire Benston ([[Verree Teasdale]]). Yearning for complete financial independence from Flint, Paul gives his entire fortune to a shady stock speculator to manipulate Rader and Flint company stock. Flint finds out and warns him that he is getting into trouble, to no avail.  Paul moves forward to his plan; he reveals to Pierre that he is Pierre's father and the two look forward to a future in business together.\n\nIt all comes crashing down. The stock speculator turns out to be a swindler and absconds with all of Paul's money and $70,000 of Lady Benston's; his benefactress declares she wants nothing further to do with him. Paul is devastated by the news that his son, while driving a new car given him by his father, has been killed. When he brings the body to the grieving mother, she refuses to shake his hand. Finally, Paul's marriage ends as Hazel learns of Pierre's parentage and declares that she's glad he is dead. Ruined and heartsick, Paul seeks out his mother. She comforts him, telling him that he has finally learned what is important and that he can make a fresh start back in Europe.

Martin's ''The Winds of Winter'' |first=Andrea |last=Towers |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=February 26, 2014 |accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref>  The popularity of the character led Martin and [[Bantam Books]] to publish in 2013 ''[[The Wit & Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister]]'', an illustrated collection of Tyrion quotes from the novels.\n\nTyrion is the second son and youngest child of Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] of [[Casterly Rock]], the patriarch of [[House Lannister]], one of the wealthiest and most powerful families in the fictional continent of [[Westeros]], and Tywin's beloved [[first cousin]] and wife Lady [[Joanna Lannister]].  As Tyrion is born a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] and his mother died during childbirth, he is resented by Tywin since birth.  In the story, Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the prejudice he has received all of his life, even from his own family, especially his father Tywin and sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]].  Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence.  As the peaceful rule of King [[Robert Baratheon]] begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are at holding everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful [[Catelyn Stark]] and her sister [[Lysa Arryn]], and then is sent by his father [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] to impose order on the capital of [[King's Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)|King's Landing]], as well as his nephew [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], the new king, as civil war begins. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey, including Tyrion's own scheming sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger and without his usual Lannister resources.\n\nThe character is portrayed by American actor [[Peter Dinklage]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', a role for which he has received significant and widespread critical acclaim.  In 2011, Dinklage won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] and later the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film]] for his portrayal of Tyrion in the [[HBO]] series.  He won the Emmy again in 2015, 2018 and 2019.

Tyrion's elder sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King [[Robert Baratheon]], and Cersei's male twin [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is one of the Kingsguard, the royal bodyguard.

Tyrion's previous efforts, crucial in keeping Joffrey in power and saving King's Landing from invasion are all but forgotten. Joffrey, emboldened by Tywin's return, publicly humiliates Tyrion; when Joffrey is murdered, everyone eagerly points the finger at Tyrion. Cersei does everything in her power to assure that he is declared guilty at trial. Innocent but condemned to death and hated more than ever, Tyrion takes a dark turn. Martin explains:\n\n{{quote|[Tyrion]'s lost everything ...

The author continues, \"He's furious at Lord Tywin because he found out the truth about his first wife and what happened to her, and ... Lord Tywin is convinced that since he doesn't love Tyrion, then no one can possibly love Tyrion.\" As Tywin repeatedly calls Tyrion's tragic first wife Tysha a \"whore,\" Tyrion warns him to stop. Tywin has always taught his son that you must follow through on your threats if you are defied, so when he fails to heed Tyrion's warning, the dwarf kills him. \"And it will haunt him. Tywin was his father and that will continue to haunt him, probably for the rest of his life,\" says the author.<ref name=\"GRRM EW interview 2014-06\"/> To Martin, Shae's murder is something else:\n\n{{quote|With Shae, it's a much more deliberate and in some ways a crueler thing.

Tyrion is also given the difficult task of hosting the visiting Dornish convoy from the hostile [[House Martell]].\n\nAt the celebration of Joffrey's wedding to [[Margaery Tyrell]], Joffrey openly humiliates Tyrion but later dies from poisoned wine.  Cersei promptly accuses and arrests Tyrion.  His previous good deeds forgotten, Tyrion is put on trial as Cersei manipulates the proceedings to ensure a guilty verdict.  He is heartbroken to find that Shae has also turned against him and openly humiliates him in court.  In his grief and anger, Tyrion demands a [[trial by combat]], to which Cersei responds by naming the formidable Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] as her champion.  After Bronn has been bribed into not fighting for Tyrion, Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] surprisingly agrees to become Tyrion's champion so he can fight Gregor, but dies in the duel and hence Tyrion loses the trial.  Pronounced guilty, Tyrion is taken to the dungeon on [[death row]], but a recently returned Jaime frees him with the help of [[spymaster]] [[Varys]] and eventually confesses his complicity in Tywin's ruin of Tyrion's first wife Tysha.  Furious, Tyrion swears revenge on his family for a lifetime of cruelty, falsely admits to murdering Joffrey and reveals Cersei's [[promiscuity]] in order to hurt Jaime.  Before escaping the palace, Tyrion acquires a [[secret passage]] from Varys into Tywin's chamber, and finds Shae naked in Tywin's bed.  After strangling her in a rage, Tyrion confronts and corners Tywin on the [[garderobe#Toilet|privy]] with a [[crossbow]].  When Tywin speaks ill of Tysha, Tyrion fatally shoots his father before fleeing Westeros in a ship organized by Varys.<ref name=\"Storm\">{{cite book |first=George R.

There he learns that Varys and Illyrio have secretly plotted to reinstate the [[House Targaryen|Targaryen dynasty]] since the murder of the Mad King [[Aerys II Targaryen|Aerys II]].  On Illyrio's advice, Tyrion agrees to seek out and join Aerys' surviving daughter [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] at [[Meereen]] and help her reclaim the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]].  He realizes that two of his traveling companions are not what they seem \u2014 one sellsword named \"Griff\" is [[Jon Connington]], [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Crown Prince Rhaegar]]'s close friend and Aerys' disgraced former Hand of the King; the other teenager named \"Young Griff\" is claimed to be Rhaegar's supposely slain son [[Aegon VI Targaryen|Aegon]], whom Varys allegedly had spirited away and replaced with another baby who was instead killed by Gregor Clegane during the Lannisters' sack of King's Landing.  Tyrion then uses a game of [[chess|cyvasse]] to sabotage Illyrio's plan by persuading Young Griff abandoning the idea of alliance with Daenerys.\n\nWhile stopping at the trading town Selhorys on the way to [[Volantis (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Volantis]], Tyrion visits a brothel and is recognized and abducted by an exiled [[Jorah Mormont]], who believes that delivering a Lannister to Daenerys will return himself to her good graces.  After negotiating a passage to Meereen along with a dwarf girl named Penny, their ship is disabled by a violent storm and all of them are captured and enslaved by the Yunkai'i [[Slave trade|slaver]]s currently besieging the Meereen.  During the [[armistice]], Tyrion and Penny are forced to perform mock [[joust]]s riding pigs in the [[colosseum|fighting pit]]s of Meereen, which are actually staged as a spectacle to have them eventually eaten by [[lion]]s, but they are saved when Daenerys intervenes and stops the show.\n\nWhen the plague of [[dysentery|bloody flux]] strikes the slavers' siege camps, Tyrion engineers their escape by murdering the overseer with [[poisonous mushroom]]s, and they join the sellsword company the Second Sons, whose leader Ben Plumm knows Jorah.  In exchange for membership, Tyrion promises the company the wealth of [[Casterly Rock]], his birthright since Tywin is dead and Jaime has renounced it to join the Kingsguard.  Tyrion quickly realizes the Yunkai'i forces are on the losing side, and attempts to convince the Second Sons to change their allegiance.<ref name=\"Dance\">{{cite book |first=George R.

Tywin angrily refuses and threatens to hang Shae if she is found in his bed again, but does have Tyrion named as Master of Coin, the treasurer. He also forces Tyrion to marry Sansa Stark against his will, though both decide not to consummate the marriage. Tyrion and Sansa begin to bond as they are both outcasts in King's Landing, until Sansa discovers that her mother Catelyn and brother Robb have been murdered as a result of Tywin's scheming.\n\n====Season 4====\nIn March 2014, Dinklage confirmed that Season 4 would \"stick fairly closely\" to Tyrion's plot line in ''A Storm of Swords'', adding that \"those reversals of fortune really send [Tyrion] down the rabbit hole.\" He notes that the character changes in Season 4, and \"really ends up in a different place than he thought he was going to. It's fueled a bit by anger towards his family, and trying to find his place in the world. You see that some people rely on drunk, funny Tyrion. I think funny and drunk lasts only so long. He sobers up in many ways. And love is in his life [with Shae], and that causes a tremendous amount of damage \u2013 because he's vulnerable and he doesn't like to be vulnerable. He's completely stripped of his defense mechanisms.\"<ref name=\"EW 2014-03 Dinklage\"/> Of Tyrion's relationship with his brother Jaime, Dinklage said, \"If you're raised together, you have an unspoken dialogue many times, and it's very easy, especially between Jaime and Tyrion. They have a real friendship, a good brotherhood. They look after each other.\"<ref name=\"EW 2014-03 Dinklage\"/> As in the novels, Tyrion is (unfairly) found guilty of Joffrey's murder and condemned to death; the HBO series does not use the reveal that his first wife was not really a prostitute to motivate Tyrion to kill his father, and he does not lie to Jaime that he is guilty of killing Joffrey.<ref name=\"HuffPost Bradley 2014-06\">{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/16/george-rr-martin-tyrion-finale_n_5500529.html |title=George R.R.

She refuses until he calls her a whore, and declares that she cannot have his children. Joffrey is poisoned to death at his wedding feast, and Cersei immediately accuses Tyrion. At his trial, Shae appears to testify against him, falsely claiming that Sansa refused to bed Tyrion unless he killed Joffrey. Outraged at her betrayal and finally snapping from years of mockery for his dwarfism, Tyrion demands a trial by combat but only after a very intense monologue about the people he hates/despises and the state of affairs. Cersei names the virtually undefeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Tyrion is defended by Oberyn Martell, who believes that his sister, niece, and nephew were murdered by Gregor. Oberyn is nearly victorious, but his refusal to kill Gregor without obtaining a confession gives Gregor the opportunity to kill him, and Tyrion is sentenced to death. Before his execution, Tyrion is released by Jaime to be smuggled out of Westeros by Varys. Tyrion decides to confront Tywin before his flight, and finds Shae in his father's bed. Tyrion strangles her to death, and then confronts Tywin on the privy. Tyrion kills his father with a crossbow bolt, and then leaves for Pentos with Varys.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn 2015, [[James Hibberd (writer)|James Hibberd]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called Tyrion's meeting with [[Daenerys Targaryen]] ([[Emilia Clarke]]) an \"iconic meetup\" that \"delighted fans, who were universally enthusiastic (for once!) about the showrunners making a narrative move not yet found in George R.R. Martin\u2019s novels.\"<ref name=\"EW 2015-06 Daenerys\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/03/game-thrones-dinklage-clarke-interview |title=''Game of Thrones'': Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke on being TV's new power couple |first=James |last=Hibberd |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=June 10, 2015 |accessdate=June 10, 2015}}</ref> Dinklage said in the interview, \"That\u2019s the great thing about my character: He\u2019s been everywhere. He\u2019s the only character that goes searching. He\u2019s been to The Wall and now he has to find the dragons.\"<ref name=\"EW 2015-06 Daenerys\"/> Benioff and Weiss said that the conversation between Tyrion and Daenerys focused on the parallels between their lives, as Tyrion had a \"lot of empathy\" toward Daenerys for being an orphan, like himself, and both had \"terrible fathers\". Tyrion realized that Varys might be right about Daenerys being the \"last hope for Westeros\". Benioff and Weiss also suggested that Tyrion believes that Daenerys could bring him \"back into power\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/game-thrones-producers-discuss-first-meeting-between-tyrion-lannister-daenerys-1947753|title=''Game Of Thrones'' Producers Discuss First Meeting Between Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen|work=[[International Business Times]] |first=Sachin |last=Trivedi |date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nTyrion arrives in Pentos, where Varys reveals that he has been conspiring to restore House Targaryen to power, and asks Tyrion to journey with him to meet Daenerys Targaryen in Meereen. During their journey, Tyrion is kidnapped by Daenerys' former advisor Jorah Mormont, who aims to redeem himself to Daenerys by bringing her the dwarf. However, Tyrion and Jorah are captured by slavers, whom Tyrion convinces to sell them to the fighting pits in Meereen. During a demonstration of pit fighters, Tyrion and Jorah encounter Daenerys; she decides to take Tyrion into her service, but orders Jorah exiled again. At the re-opening of Meereen's fighting pits, the insurgency known as the Sons of the Harpy launch a massive attack, which is only thwarted when Daenerys' dragon [[Drogon (Game of Thrones)|Drogon]] appears and scares off the Sons, before riding off with Daenerys on his back. Although Tyrion wishes to join Jorah and [[Daario Naharis]] in their search for Daenerys, Daario points out that his skills are best suited to governing Meereen in Daenerys' absence. Varys later arrives in Meereen, and offers Tyrion the use of his spy network to maintain order in the city.\n\n====Season 6====\nTyrion discovers that the Sons of the Harpy are funded by the slavers of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, and arranges a meeting with representatives of those cities to give them seven years to abolish slavery. Despite Tyrion's insistence that compromise is necessary, this solution is met with disapproval by Daenerys' other advisors and the freedmen of Meereen. Tyrion also enlists the assistance of the red priestess Kinvara, who believes that Daenerys is a messianic figure prophesied by her faith and offers the support of the followers of [[R'hllor]]. Meereen begins to prosper, but the city's success attracts the ire of the slavers, who fear it will undermine the legitimacy of slavery, and so launch a massive naval attack against the city. Daenerys returns in the chaos, and though she is displeased with Tyrion's failure, she is persuaded by him to obliterate the slavers' fleet and force their ultimate surrender rather than destroy them outright. Soon after, [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] and [[Yara Greyjoy]] arrive in Meereen offering Daenerys the Iron Fleet; they are joined by the fleets of [[Dorne]] and [[the Reach (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the Reach]], who have defected from the Lannisters. Daenerys names an honored Tyrion as her Hand of the Queen. Tyrion then joins her, the dragons, and her army as they sail to Westeros.<ref name=\"WSJ S6 Ep10\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/06/26/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-recap-the-winds-of-winter/|work=The Wall Street Journal|title=''Game of Thrones'' Season 6 Finale Recap: 'The Winds of Winter'|last=Calia|first=Michael|date=June 26, 2016|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Season 7====\nPlotting their conquest of Westeros from [[Dragonstone (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Dragonstone]], the ancestral Targaryen fortress, Daenerys and Tyrion learn that [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] has been named King in the North. Tyrion suggests that Jon would make a valuable ally; Daenerys and Jon are impressed with each other, but she is annoyed when he declines to swear his allegiance to her. Daenerys and her allies discuss their strategy for the war against the Lannisters. Tyrion advises against a direct attack on King's Landing, and Daenerys agrees to his nuanced series of attacks. However, Cersei and Jaime outmaneuver him, neutralizing Daenerys' Tyrell and Dornish support. A furious Daenerys ignores Tyrion's continued arguments for caution, and decimates a Lannister caravan with her dragons. He is also unable to stop her from executing [[Randyll Tarly|Randyll]] and [[Dickon Tarly]], who refuse to swear fealty to her even after their defeat. In \"[[Eastwatch]]\", Tyrion meets with Jaime in secret to broker a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys. In \"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]\", he helps convince Cersei that the advancing undead are a more immediate threat than the war with Daenerys for control of Westeros.\n\n====Season 8====\nTyrion returns to Winterfell with the Targaryen forces. He is reunited with Sansa, who doubts Cersei's promise to send aid and is disappointed that Tyrion would fall for Cersei's lie. Jaime later arrives in Winterfell and provides confirmation that no Lannister forces are coming. Daenerys questions Tyrion's ability to serve as her Hand after so many mistakes in judgment, but after talking to Jorah privately, she acknowledges that Tyrion is useful to her, and orders him down in the crypts during the battle against the dead for his own safety, to his chagrin. During the battle, the [[Night King]] reanimates the Starks buried in the crypts; Tyrion and Sansa hide together, prepared to face the horde, but soon the Night King is killed and the Army of the Dead destroyed.\n\nWhile preparing to travel south to besiege King's Landing, Tyrion learns from Sansa of Jon's heritage as a trueborn Targaryen. He tells Varys, who considers whether Jon is a better option to rule Westeros than Daenerys. Tyrion recommits to Daenerys and reveals Varys' treachery, and Daenerys executes Varys. Tyrion convinces Daenerys to halt the destruction of King's Landing if the people surrender, signalled by the ringing of the city's bells. Tyrion releases Jaime, who has been captured attempting to sneak into King's Landing, and sends him to convince Cersei to surrender rather than face Daenerys' wrath. Though the city surrenders, Tyrion is horrified when Daenerys uses Drogon to burn the city, destroy the Red Keep, and slaughter the population. Following the battle, Tyrion wanders through the ruins of King's Landing and eventually discovers the corpses of Jaime and Cersei, crushed by rubble in the Red Keep. After the victorious Daenerys promises to take her armies on a campaign of \"liberation\" throughout the world, she accuses Tyrion of treason for releasing Jaime. When he resigns as Hand in protest, she has him arrested and sentences him to death. In prison, Tyrion persuades Jon that he must kill Daenerys for the good of the realm. Jon hesitates but eventually does kill Daenerys, and is also imprisoned.\n\nSome time later,  Tyrion (still held prisoner of [[Grey Worm]] and [[the Unsullied]]) persuades a council of the most powerful lords and ladies of Westeros to reject coronation by birthright and to instead agree to select each new ruler by council vote. He then suggests they make Bran king, claiming Bran's supernatural knowledge and wisdom make him an unparalleled choice to lead Westeros. The council votes unanimously in favor. Bran accepts the position and names Tyrion as his Hand of the King, remarking that the appointment is intended to force Tyrion to make amends for his mistakes. Tyrion passes on to Jon the news that he is to be exiled to the Night's Watch again, and bids him farewell. Some time later, he presides over King Bran's first small council meeting.\n\n===Appearances in other media===\n\nIn 2019, Peter Dinklage and [[Lena Headey]] appeared as Tyrion and Cersei Lannister

As Tyrion is born a [[dwarfism|dwarf]] and his mother died during childbirth, he is resented by Tywin since birth.  In the story, Tyrion uses his status as a Lannister to mitigate the prejudice he has received all of his life, even from his own family, especially his father Tywin and sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]].  Knowing that no one will ever take him seriously, he soothes his inadequacies with wine, wit and self-indulgence.  As the peaceful rule of King [[Robert Baratheon]] begins to decay, Tyrion sees how ill-equipped his family are at holding everything together. He first saves his own neck from the vengeful [[Catelyn Stark]] and her sister [[Lysa Arryn]], and then is sent by his father [[Tywin Lannister|Tywin]] to impose order on the capital of [[King's Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)|King's Landing]], as well as his nephew [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]], the new king, as civil war begins. Tyrion struggles to strengthen and protect the city and family who hate him and refuse to see the peril they are in; when his father returns, Tyrion becomes vulnerable to the wrath and machinations of the self-serving courtiers who surround Joffrey, including Tyrion's own scheming sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]]. Tyrion escapes death again but at great cost and in fleeing Westeros finds himself in even more danger and without his usual Lannister resources.\n\nThe character is portrayed by American actor [[Peter Dinklage]] in the [[HBO]] television adaptation ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', a role for which he has received significant and widespread critical acclaim.  In 2011, Dinklage won the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] and later the [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film|Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film]] for his portrayal of Tyrion in the [[HBO]] series.  He won the Emmy again in 2015, 2018 and 2019.  Among other accolades, Dinklage has been nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==Character==\n===Description===\nIn ''A Game of Thrones'' (1996), Tyrion is introduced as the third and youngest child of wealthy and powerful [[Tywin Lannister]], the former Hand of the King, and [[Joanna Lannister]], who dies giving birth to him. Tyrion's elder sister [[Cersei Lannister|Cersei]] is the Queen of Westeros by virtue of her marriage to King [[Robert Baratheon]], and Cersei's male twin [[Jaime Lannister|Jaime]] is one of the Kingsguard, the royal bodyguard. Described as an ugly (\"for all the world like a gargoyle\"), malformed dwarf with [[different colored eyes]], green and black, Tyrion possesses the golden blond hair of a Lannister but has a complicated relationship with the rest of them.<ref name=\"Wit Suvudu\">{{cite web |url=http://sf-fantasy.suvudu.com/2013/10/new-release-interview-the-wit-wisdom-of-tyrion-lannister.html |title=New Release Interview: ''The Wit & Wisdom of Tyrion Lannister'' |first=Shawn |last=Speakman |publisher=[[Suvudu]] ([[Random House]]) |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=July 20, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"EW book club 2011 #1\">{{cite web |url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2011/04/04/game-of-thrones-book-club-2/ |title=The ''Game of Thrones'' Book Club, week 1: First impressions, and when I got hooked |first=Hillary |last=Busis |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=April 4, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}</ref> While he is afforded the privilege and luxuries of his family, he is treated as a \"second class noble\" because of his stature.<ref name=\"NPR 2012\">{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/21/153198363/peter-dinklage-on-thrones-and-on-his-own-terms |title=Peter Dinklage: On ''Thrones'', And On His Own Terms |publisher=[[NPR]] |date=May 21, 2012 |accessdate=July 20, 2014}}</ref> Tyrion's mother [[Joanna Lannister|Joanna]] died giving birth to him and Tywin and Cersei loathe him because they blame him for her death.

He gets off a lot of good iconoclastic, cynical one-liners, and those are fun to write. He's also a very gray character. All my characters are gray to a greater or lesser extent, but Tyrion is perhaps the deepest shade of gray, with the black and white in him most thoroughly mixed, and I find that very appealing. I've always liked gray characters more than black-and-white characters ... I look for ways to make my characters real and to make them human, characters who have good and bad, noble and selfish, well-mixed in their natures. Yes, I do certainly want people to think about the characters, and not just react with a knee-jerk. I read too much fiction myself in which you encounter characters who are very stereotyped. They're heroic-hero and dastardly-villain, and they're completely black or completely white.

Initially he is the one Lannister remotely sympathetic to the [[House Stark|Starks]] but he is soon caught in the middle of the conflict between the two Houses.<ref name=\"sfreviews GOT 2001\">{{cite web |url=http://www.sfreviews.net/gameofthrones.html |title=Review: ''A Game of Thrones'' (1996) |first=Thomas M. |last=Wagner |publisher=SFReviews.net |year=2001 |accessdate=July 24, 2014}}</ref> Taken prisoner and put on trial for his life, \"all of his skills at conniving must be brought to bear simply to stay alive\".<ref name=\"sfreviews GOT 2001\"/> With the Starks and Lannisters fully at war, Tywin tasks Tyrion to manage affairs at [[King's Landing (A Song of Ice and Fire)|King's Landing]], recognizing that his son is intelligent and has inherited his skills with statecraft. In ''A Clash of Kings'', Tyrion relishes his new power but finds that his sincere efforts to stabilize his nephew [[Joffrey Baratheon|Joffrey]]'s rule are being undermined and thwarted by the misguided and self-serving machinations of everyone around him. He plots to nullify the counterproductive whims of Joffrey and Cersei but the \"much-maligned dwarf\" finds himself \"teetering between order and disaster as he tries to keep the Lannisters from losing absolutely everything\".<ref name=\"sfreviews COC 2001\"/> Thomas M.

Tyrion's previous efforts, crucial in keeping Joffrey in power and saving King's Landing from invasion are all but forgotten. Joffrey, emboldened by Tywin's return, publicly humiliates Tyrion; when Joffrey is murdered, everyone eagerly points the finger at Tyrion. Cersei does everything in her power to assure that he is declared guilty at trial. Innocent but condemned to death and hated more than ever, Tyrion takes a dark turn. Martin explains:\n\n{{quote|[Tyrion]'s lost everything ... He's lost his position in House Lannister, he's lost his position in court, he's lost all of his gold \u2013 which is the one thing that's kind of sustained him throughout his life ... and he's also found out that Jaime \u2013 the one blood relation that he loved unreservedly and has his back, and was always on his side \u2013 played a part in this traumatic event of his life, the ultimate betrayal ... He's so hurt that he wants to hurt other people ... and he knows that just up this ladder is a chamber that was once his that now his father has usurped from him ...

And of course then we find Shae there, that's an additional shock to him, an additional knife in his belly. I think sometimes people just get pushed too far, sometimes people break. And I think Tyrion has reached his point. He's been through hell, he's faced death over and over again, and he's been betrayed, as he sees it, by all the people that he's tried to take care of, that he's tried to win the approval of.

The author continues, \"He's furious at Lord Tywin because he found out the truth about his first wife and what happened to her, and ... Lord Tywin is convinced that since he doesn't love Tyrion, then no one can possibly love Tyrion.\" As Tywin repeatedly calls Tyrion's tragic first wife Tysha a \"whore,\" Tyrion warns him to stop. Tywin has always taught his son that you must follow through on your threats if you are defied, so when he fails to heed Tyrion's warning, the dwarf kills him. \"And it will haunt him. Tywin was his father and that will continue to haunt him, probably for the rest of his life,\" says the author.<ref name=\"GRRM EW interview 2014-06\"/> To Martin, Shae's murder is something else:\n\n{{quote|With Shae, it's a much more deliberate and in some ways a crueler thing.

For his friendship with Jon, Tyrion visits Winterfell again on the return and designs with a specialized [[saddle]] to help Bran ride a horse.\n\nHowever at the Crossroad Inn, Tyrion encounters Ned's wife [[Catelyn Stark|Catelyn]], who accuses him of hiring an assassin to [[attempted murder|try murder]] Bran and arrests him by enlisting nearby [[men-at-arms]].  Catelyn then takes the captured Tyrion to [[the Eyrie]] in [[the Vale]], so he can be judged by Catelyn's sister [[Lysa Arryn]].  Tyrion denies the charges and demands a [[trial by combat]], and is championed by a [[mercenary|sellsword]] named [[Bronn (character)|Bronn]], who wins the duel and secures Tyrion's freedom.  Using his wit and the promise of a reward, Tyrion wins over the mountain tribes as his personal bodyguards while on his way to the Lannister army camp.  He then participates in the Battle on the Green Fork, sent as the [[vanguard]] by his father [[Tywin Lannister]].  Finally impressed with Tyrion's capabilities, Tywin dispatches Tyrion to the capital city King's Landing as the acting Hand of the King in an attempt to control King Joffrey and [[Cersei Lannister|Queen Cersei]]'s political recklessness.

When fighting on the burning wreckage of Stannis fleet, Tyrion is attacked and grievously wounded by the Kingsguard knight Ser Mandon Moore, but is saved by his young squire [[Podrick Payne]].

Tyrion is  then appointed [[treasurer|Master of Coin]] as a \"reward\" for his successful leadership (which is really the burden of fixing the Crown's fiscal mess).  After learning of the [[House Tyrell|Tyrell]] plot to claim Winterfell through marriage to Sansa, Tywin forces Tyrion to marry her instead.  Sympathetic to Sansa's situation, Tyrion leaves their marriage unconsummated, despite his father's orders to conceive a child with her as soon as possible.  Tyrion is also given the difficult task of hosting the visiting Dornish convoy from the hostile [[House Martell]].\n\nAt the celebration of Joffrey's wedding to [[Margaery Tyrell]], Joffrey openly humiliates Tyrion but later dies from poisoned wine.  Cersei promptly accuses and arrests Tyrion.  His previous good deeds forgotten, Tyrion is put on trial as Cersei manipulates the proceedings to ensure a guilty verdict.  He is heartbroken to find that Shae has also turned against him and openly humiliates him in court.  In his grief and anger, Tyrion demands a [[trial by combat]], to which Cersei responds by naming the formidable Ser [[Gregor Clegane]] as her champion.  After Bronn has been bribed into not fighting for Tyrion, Prince [[Oberyn Martell]] surprisingly agrees to become Tyrion's champion so he can fight Gregor, but dies in the duel and hence Tyrion loses the trial.  Pronounced guilty, Tyrion is taken to the dungeon on [[death row]], but a recently returned Jaime frees him with the help of [[spymaster]] [[Varys]] and eventually confesses his complicity in Tywin's ruin of Tyrion's first wife Tysha.  Furious, Tyrion swears revenge on his family for a lifetime of cruelty, falsely admits to murdering Joffrey and reveals Cersei's [[promiscuity]] in order to hurt Jaime.  Before escaping the palace, Tyrion acquires a [[secret passage]] from Varys into Tywin's chamber, and finds Shae naked in Tywin's bed.

On Illyrio's advice, Tyrion agrees to seek out and join Aerys' surviving daughter [[Daenerys Targaryen|Daenerys]] at [[Meereen]] and help her reclaim the [[Iron Throne (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Iron Throne]].  He realizes that two of his traveling companions are not what they seem \u2014 one sellsword named \"Griff\" is [[Jon Connington]], [[Rhaegar Targaryen|Crown Prince Rhaegar]]'s close friend and Aerys' disgraced former Hand of the King; the other teenager named \"Young Griff\" is claimed to be Rhaegar's supposely slain son [[Aegon VI Targaryen|Aegon]], whom Varys allegedly had spirited away and replaced with another baby who was instead killed by Gregor Clegane during the Lannisters' sack of King's Landing.  Tyrion then uses a game of [[chess|cyvasse]] to sabotage Illyrio's plan by persuading Young Griff abandoning the idea of alliance with Daenerys.\n\nWhile stopping at the trading town Selhorys on the way to [[Volantis (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Volantis]], Tyrion visits a brothel and is recognized and abducted by an exiled [[Jorah Mormont]], who believes that delivering a Lannister to Daenerys will return himself to her good graces.

Taken to the Eyrie, where Catelyn's sister Lysa Arryn rules as regent, Tyrion is put to trial. Tyrion demands trial by combat, naming as his champion the sellsword Bronn, who is victorious.

Tyrion destroys much of Stannis' attacking fleet with wildfire, but is almost assassinated during the battle, presumably at Joffrey's or Cersei's command. Tyrion recovers to find himself stripped of power by his returned father, and without recognition for his heroics.

Tywin angrily refuses and threatens to hang Shae if she is found in his bed again, but does have Tyrion named as Master of Coin, the treasurer. He also forces Tyrion to marry Sansa Stark against his will, though both decide not to consummate the marriage. Tyrion and Sansa begin to bond as they are both outcasts in King's Landing, until Sansa discovers that her mother Catelyn and brother Robb have been murdered as a result of Tywin's scheming.\n\n====Season 4====\nIn March 2014, Dinklage confirmed that Season 4 would \"stick fairly closely\" to Tyrion's plot line in ''A Storm of Swords'', adding that \"those reversals of fortune really send [Tyrion] down the rabbit hole.\" He notes that the character changes in Season 4, and \"really ends up in a different place than he thought he was going to. It's fueled a bit by anger towards his family, and trying to find his place in the world. You see that some people rely on drunk, funny Tyrion. I think funny and drunk lasts only so long. He sobers up in many ways. And love is in his life [with Shae], and that causes a tremendous amount of damage \u2013 because he's vulnerable and he doesn't like to be vulnerable. He's completely stripped of his defense mechanisms.\"<ref name=\"EW 2014-03 Dinklage\"/> Of Tyrion's relationship with his brother Jaime, Dinklage said, \"If you're raised together, you have an unspoken dialogue many times, and it's very easy, especially between Jaime and Tyrion. They have a real friendship, a good brotherhood. They look after each other.\"<ref name=\"EW 2014-03 Dinklage\"/> As in the novels, Tyrion is (unfairly) found guilty of Joffrey's murder and condemned to death; the HBO series does not use the reveal that his first wife was not really a prostitute to motivate Tyrion to kill his father, and he does not lie to Jaime that he is guilty of killing Joffrey.<ref name=\"HuffPost Bradley 2014-06\">{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/16/george-rr-martin-tyrion-finale_n_5500529.html |title=George R.R.

She refuses until he calls her a whore, and declares that she cannot have his children. Joffrey is poisoned to death at his wedding feast, and Cersei immediately accuses Tyrion. At his trial, Shae appears to testify against him, falsely claiming that Sansa refused to bed Tyrion unless he killed Joffrey. Outraged at her betrayal and finally snapping from years of mockery for his dwarfism, Tyrion demands a trial by combat but only after a very intense monologue about the people he hates/despises and the state of affairs. Cersei names the virtually undefeatable Gregor Clegane as her champion. Tyrion is defended by Oberyn Martell, who believes that his sister, niece, and nephew were murdered by Gregor. Oberyn is nearly victorious, but his refusal to kill Gregor without obtaining a confession gives Gregor the opportunity to kill him, and Tyrion is sentenced to death. Before his execution, Tyrion is released by Jaime to be smuggled out of Westeros by Varys. Tyrion decides to confront Tywin before his flight, and finds Shae in his father's bed. Tyrion strangles her to death, and then confronts Tywin on the privy. Tyrion kills his father with a crossbow bolt, and then leaves for Pentos with Varys.\n\n====Season 5====\nIn 2015, [[James Hibberd (writer)|James Hibberd]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called Tyrion's meeting with [[Daenerys Targaryen]] ([[Emilia Clarke]]) an \"iconic meetup\" that \"delighted fans, who were universally enthusiastic (for once!) about the showrunners making a narrative move not yet found in George R.R.

Tyrion realized that Varys might be right about Daenerys being the \"last hope for Westeros\". Benioff and Weiss also suggested that Tyrion believes that Daenerys could bring him \"back into power\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/game-thrones-producers-discuss-first-meeting-between-tyrion-lannister-daenerys-1947753|title=''Game Of Thrones'' Producers Discuss First Meeting Between Tyrion Lannister, Daenerys Targaryen|work=[[International Business Times]] |first=Sachin |last=Trivedi |date=June 2, 2015|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}</ref>\n\nTyrion arrives in Pentos, where Varys reveals that he has been conspiring to restore House Targaryen to power, and asks Tyrion to journey with him to meet Daenerys Targaryen in Meereen. During their journey, Tyrion is kidnapped by Daenerys' former advisor Jorah Mormont, who aims to redeem himself to Daenerys by bringing her the dwarf. However, Tyrion and Jorah are captured by slavers, whom Tyrion convinces to sell them to the fighting pits in Meereen. During a demonstration of pit fighters, Tyrion and Jorah encounter Daenerys; she decides to take Tyrion into her service, but orders Jorah exiled again. At the re-opening of Meereen's fighting pits, the insurgency known as the Sons of the Harpy launch a massive attack, which is only thwarted when Daenerys' dragon [[Drogon (Game of Thrones)|Drogon]] appears and scares off the Sons, before riding off with Daenerys on his back. Although Tyrion wishes to join Jorah and [[Daario Naharis]] in their search for Daenerys, Daario points out that his skills are best suited to governing Meereen in Daenerys' absence. Varys later arrives in Meereen, and offers Tyrion the use of his spy network to maintain order in the city.\n\n====Season 6====\nTyrion discovers that the Sons of the Harpy are funded by the slavers of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis, and arranges a meeting with representatives of those cities to give them seven years to abolish slavery. Despite Tyrion's insistence that compromise is necessary, this solution is met with disapproval by Daenerys' other advisors and the freedmen of Meereen. Tyrion also enlists the assistance of the red priestess Kinvara, who believes that Daenerys is a messianic figure prophesied by her faith and offers the support of the followers of [[R'hllor]]. Meereen begins to prosper, but the city's success attracts the ire of the slavers, who fear it will undermine the legitimacy of slavery, and so launch a massive naval attack against the city. Daenerys returns in the chaos, and though she is displeased with Tyrion's failure, she is persuaded by him to obliterate the slavers' fleet and force their ultimate surrender rather than destroy them outright. Soon after, [[Theon Greyjoy|Theon]] and [[Yara Greyjoy]] arrive in Meereen offering Daenerys the Iron Fleet; they are joined by the fleets of [[Dorne]] and [[the Reach (A Song of Ice and Fire)|the Reach]], who have defected from the Lannisters. Daenerys names an honored Tyrion as her Hand of the Queen. Tyrion then joins her, the dragons, and her army as they sail to Westeros.<ref name=\"WSJ S6 Ep10\">{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/06/26/game-of-thrones-season-6-finale-recap-the-winds-of-winter/|work=The Wall Street Journal|title=''Game of Thrones'' Season 6 Finale Recap: 'The Winds of Winter'|last=Calia|first=Michael|date=June 26, 2016|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Season 7====\nPlotting their conquest of Westeros from [[Dragonstone (A Song of Ice and Fire)|Dragonstone]], the ancestral Targaryen fortress, Daenerys and Tyrion learn that [[Jon Snow (character)|Jon Snow]] has been named King in the North. Tyrion suggests that Jon would make a valuable ally; Daenerys and Jon are impressed with each other, but she is annoyed when he declines to swear his allegiance to her. Daenerys and her allies discuss their strategy for the war against the Lannisters. Tyrion advises against a direct attack on King's Landing, and Daenerys agrees to his nuanced series of attacks. However, Cersei and Jaime outmaneuver him, neutralizing Daenerys' Tyrell and Dornish support. A furious Daenerys ignores Tyrion's continued arguments for caution, and decimates a Lannister caravan with her dragons. He is also unable to stop her from executing [[Randyll Tarly|Randyll]] and [[Dickon Tarly]], who refuse to swear fealty to her even after their defeat. In \"[[Eastwatch]]\", Tyrion meets with Jaime in secret to broker a meeting between Cersei and Daenerys. In \"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]\", he helps convince Cersei that the advancing undead are a more immediate threat than the war with Daenerys for control of Westeros.\n\n====Season 8====\nTyrion returns to Winterfell with the Targaryen forces. He is reunited with Sansa, who doubts Cersei's promise to send aid and is disappointed that Tyrion would fall for Cersei's lie. Jaime later arrives in Winterfell and provides confirmation that no Lannister forces are coming. Daenerys questions Tyrion's ability to serve as her Hand after so many mistakes in judgment, but after talking to Jorah privately, she acknowledges that Tyrion is useful to her, and orders him down in the crypts during the battle against the dead for his own safety, to his chagrin. During the battle, the [[Night King]] reanimates the Starks buried in the crypts; Tyrion and Sansa hide together, prepared to face the horde, but soon the Night King is killed and the Army of the Dead destroyed.\n\nWhile preparing to travel south to besiege King's Landing, Tyrion learns from Sansa of Jon's heritage as a trueborn Targaryen. He tells Varys, who considers whether Jon is a better option to rule Westeros than Daenerys. Tyrion recommits to Daenerys and reveals Varys' treachery, and Daenerys executes Varys. Tyrion convinces Daenerys to halt the destruction of King's Landing if the people surrender, signalled by the ringing of the city's bells. Tyrion releases Jaime, who has been captured attempting to sneak into King's Landing, and sends him to convince Cersei to surrender rather than face Daenerys' wrath. Though the city surrenders, Tyrion is horrified when Daenerys uses Drogon to burn the city, destroy the Red Keep, and slaughter the population. Following the battle, Tyrion wanders through the ruins of King's Landing and eventually discovers the corpses of Jaime and Cersei, crushed by rubble in the Red Keep. After the victorious Daenerys promises to take her armies on a campaign of \"liberation\" throughout the world, she accuses Tyrion of treason for releasing Jaime. When he resigns as Hand in protest, she has him arrested and sentences him to death. In prison, Tyrion persuades Jon that he must kill Daenerys for the good of the realm. Jon hesitates but eventually does kill Daenerys, and is also imprisoned.\n\nSome time later,  Tyrion (still held prisoner of [[Grey Worm]] and [[the Unsullied]]) persuades a council of the most powerful lords and ladies of Westeros to reject coronation by birthright and to instead agree to select each new ruler by council vote. He then suggests they make Bran king, claiming Bran's supernatural knowledge and wisdom make him an unparalleled choice to lead Westeros. The council votes unanimously in favor. Bran accepts the position and names Tyrion as his Hand of the King, remarking that the appointment is intended to force Tyrion to make amends for his mistakes. Tyrion passes on to Jon the news that he is to be exiled to the Night's Watch again, and bids him farewell. Some time later, he presides over King Bran's first small council meeting.\n\n===Appearances in other media===\n\nIn 2019, Peter Dinklage and [[Lena Headey]] appeared as Tyrion and Cersei Lannister

acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), lead to the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]]. Over 8,000 people from 29 different countries and territories were infected, and at least 774 died worldwide.{{R|\"SARS2003BusIn\"}}\n\n===MERS===\n{{Main|Middle East respiratory syndrome}}\n\nIn 2012 ''[[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus]]'' (''MERS-CoV''), causing Middle East respiratory syndrome, was identified.{{R|\"NPR MERS 2012\"}}\n\nMERS-CoV is responsible for the [[2012 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreak|2012 MERS outbreak]], primarily in the [[Middle East]], the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|2015 MERS outbreak]] in [[South Korea]] and the [[2018 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak|2018 MERS outbreak]] primarily in [[Saudi Arabia]].\n\n===COVID-19===\n{{main|Coronavirus disease 2019}}\n\nThe [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] (SARS-CoV-2), causing [[coronavirus disease 2019]] (COVID-19), which in December 2019 led to a [[pneumonia]] outbreak in [[Wuhan]], [[China]] resulted in the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Coronaviruses==\n{{Main|Coronavirus}}\n\nCoronaviruses are [[virus|viruses]] which cause diseases in [[mammals]] and [[birds]]. In humans the viruses cause [[respiratory tract infection|respiratory tract infections]] which can range from mild to lethal.{{R|\"CDC Common Human Coronaviruses\"}}\n\nSix species of human coronaviruses are known, of which four are among the viruses which cause the common cold or common respiratory illnesses: [[HCoV-229E]], [[HCoV-NL63]], [[HCoV-OC43]], and [[HCoV-HKU1]].{{R|\"CDC Common Human Coronaviruses\"}}{{R|\"CoVs common cold\"}}{{R|\"Fehr_2015\"}}{{R|\"pmid29551135\"}}\nTwo additional species cause more severe symptoms and may be lethal: [[MERS-CoV]] and two different
