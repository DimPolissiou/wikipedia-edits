The earliest allusion to the custom of marking this week as a whole with special observances is to be found in the [[Apostolical Constitutions]] (v. 18, 19), dating from the latter half of the 3rd century and 4th century. In this text, abstinence from flesh is commanded for all the days, while for the Friday and Saturday an [[Black Fast|absolute fast]] is commanded. Dionysius Alexandrinus in his canonical epistle (AD 260), refers to the 91 fasting days implying that the observance of them had already become an established usage in his time.<ref>Apostolical Constitutions v. 18, 19</ref>\n\nThere is some doubt about the genuineness of an ordinance attributed to Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], in which abstinence from public business was enforced for the seven days immediately preceding [[Easter Day]], and also for the seven which followed it. The ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'', however, is explicit in ordering that all actions at law should cease, and the doors of all courts of law be closed during those 15 days (1. ii. tit. viii.).\n\nOf the particular days of the \"great week\" the earliest to emerge into special prominence was naturally Good Friday. Next came the ''Sabbatum Magnum'' (\"Great Sabbath\", i.e., [[Holy Saturday]] or Easter Eve) with its [[Paschal vigil|vigil]], which in the [[early church]] was associated with an expectation that the [[second advent]] would occur on an Easter Day.\n\nOther writings that refer to related traditions of the early Church include, most notably, ''The Pilgrimage of Etheria'' (also known as ''The Pilgrimage of [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]]''), which details the whole observance of Holy Week at that time.\n\nToday, in the [[Western Christian Church]], among Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Presbyterians and Catholics, the liturgies used for Holy Week are nearly identical.<ref name=\"Ramshaw2004\">{{cite book|last=Ramshaw|first=Gail|title=The Three-Day Feast: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tbb9axN6qFwC&pg=PA7|accessdate=13 April 2014|year=2004|publisher=Augsburg Books|quote=Many Christians are already familiar with the ancient, and now recently restored, liturgies of the Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the great Easter Vigil service of light, readings, baptism, and communion.

Traditionally, Palm Sunday commemorates the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] described in all four [[canonical gospel]]s.  As described in the accounts, Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was noted by the crowds present who shouted praises and waved [[Palm branch (symbol)|palm branches]]. In the Roman Rite, before 1955 it was known simply as Palm Sunday, and the preceding Sunday as Passion Sunday. From 1955 to 1971 it was called Second Sunday in [[Passiontide]] or Palm Sunday. Among Lutherans and Anglicans, the day is known as the Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday.<ref name=\"Bower2003\">{{cite book|last=Bower|first=Peter C.|title=The Companion to the Book of Common Worship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dyWqm3hCMC0C&pg=PA111|accessdate=13 April 2014|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Geneva Press|isbn=9780664502324|page=111|quote=Presbyterians, Methodists, and Roman Catholics call this day Passion/Palm Sunday; the United Church of Christ calls it Palm/Passion Sunday; Lutherans and Episcopalians call it The Sunday of the Passion: Palm Sunday.}}</ref>\n\nIn many liturgical denominations, to commemorate the Messiah's entry into [[Jerusalem]] to accomplish his [[paschal mystery]], it is customary to have a blessing of [[Arecaceae|palm leaves]] (or other branches, for example olive branches). The blessing ceremony includes the reading of a Gospel account of how Jesus rode into Jerusalem humbly on a donkey, reminiscent of a Davidic victory procession, and how people placed palms and other branches on the ground in front of him. Immediately following this great time of celebration over the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, he begins his journey to the cross. The blessing is thus followed by a procession or solemn entrance into the church, with the participants holding the blessed branches in their hands. The Mass or liturgy of worship itself includes a reading of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], the narrative of Jesus' capture, sufferings and death, as recounted in one of the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. (In the [[Tridentine Mass]] the Passion narrative read on this day is always that of St. Matthew.)\n\nBefore the reform of the rite by [[Pope Pius XII]], the blessing of the palms occurred inside the church within a liturgy that followed the general outline of a Mass, with Collect, Epistle and Gospel, as far as the Sanctus. The palms were then blessed with five prayers, and a procession went out of the church and on its return included a ceremony for the reopening of the doors, which had meantime been shut. After this the normal Mass was celebrated.<ref name=prePXII>[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum.pdf 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal]</ref>\n\nMany churches of mainstream [[Christian denominations]], including the Lutheran, Catholic, Methodist, Anglican, Moravian and Reformed traditions, distribute palm branches to their congregations during their Palm Sunday liturgies. Christians take these palms, which are often blessed by clergy, to their homes where they hang them alongside [[Christian art]] (especially [[Christian cross|crosses]] and [[crucifix]]es) or keep them in their Bibles or devotionals.<ref name=\"Kirk2018\">{{cite web |last1=Kirk |first1=Lisa |title=Ideas for Displaying Palm Sunday Palms Around Your Home |url=https://blessedisshe.net/blog/palm-sunday-palms/ |publisher=Blessed Is She |accessdate=4 April 2020 |language=English |date=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Holy Monday and Holy Tuesday===\n[[File:Catholic_Tenebrae_service.jpg|thumb|left|A Tenebrae liturgy held at a Roman Catholic parish church on Spy Wednesday (2019)]]\nThe days between Palm Sunday and Maundy Thursday are known as [[Holy Monday]], [[Holy Tuesday]], and [[Spy Wednesday]] (Holy Wednesday).  The Gospel accounts are not always clear or in agreement on the events which occurred on these days, though there are traditional observances held by some denominations to commemorate certain events from the last days of Jesus' life.  Among them\n\n* On Holy Monday, some observe the anointing of Jesus at Bethany ({{bibleverse||John|12:1-11|KJV}}), an event that in the Gospel of John occurred before the Palm Sunday event described in {{bibleverse||John|12:12-19|KJV}}.  Other events which the Gospels tell of which may have occurred on this day include [[cursing the fig tree]] and the [[Cleansing of the Temple]].\n* On Holy Tuesday, some observe Jesus' predictions of his own death, as described in {{bibleverse||John|12:20-36|KJV}} and {{bibleverse||John|13:21-38|KJV}}.

The lamp or candle usually situated next to the tabernacle denoting the Presence of Christ is put out, and the remaining [[Eucharist]]ic Hosts consecrated on Holy Thursday are kept elsewhere, usually the [[sacristy]], with a lamp or candle burning before it, so that, in cases of the danger of death, they may be given as ''[[viaticum]]''.\n\n===Easter Vigil===\n{{Main|Easter Vigil}}\n[[File:Praecentor.JPG|thumb|right|Lutheran deacon holding the [[Paschal candle]] during the Easter Vigil]]\n\nThe name of the Easter Vigil, even if the [[vigil]] is held on what on the civil calendar is still Saturday, indicates that liturgically it is already Easter, no longer part of Holy Week, but still part of the Easter Triduum.\n\nIn the Anglican, Lutheran, Catholic, Methodist, and Presbyterian traditions, the Easter Vigil, one of the longest and most solemn of liturgical liturgies, lasts up to three or four hours, consists of four parts:<ref name=\"Ramshaw2004\"/><ref name=\"Jr.2002\">{{cite book|title=Presbyterian Worship: A Guide for Clergy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNiHA25B2WQC&pg=PA102|accessdate=13 April 2014|year=2002|publisher=Geneva Press|isbn=9780664502188|page=102|quote=The Easter Vigil consists of four parts: the Service of Light, the service of Readings (the Word), the celebration of Baptism, and the celebration of the Lord's Supper.|author=J.

In the darkness (often in a side chapel of the church building or, preferably, outside the church), a new fire is kindled and blessed by the priest. This new fire symbolizes the light of salvation and hope that God brought into the world through Christ's Resurrection, dispelling the darkness of sin and death. From this fire is lit the [[Paschal candle]], symbolizing the Light of Christ. This Paschal candle will be used throughout the season of Easter, remaining in the sanctuary of the Church or near the lectern, and throughout the coming year at baptisms and funerals, reminding all that Christ is \"light and life.\"\n\n[[File:Osternacht.jpg|thumb|250px|Candles lit for the Easter Vigil at [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] in Austria]]\nThe candles of those present are lit from the Paschal candle. As this symbolic \"Light of Christ\" spreads throughout those gathered, the darkness is decreased. A deacon, or the priest if there is no deacon, carries the Paschal Candle at the head of the entrance procession and, at three points, stops and chants the proclamation \"The Light of Christ\" (until Easter 2011, the official English text was \"Christ our Light\"), to which the people respond \"Thanks be to God.\" Once the procession concludes with the singing of the third proclamation, the lights throughout the church are lit, except for the altar candles. Then the deacon or a cantor chants the [[Exultet]] (also called the \"Easter Proclamation\"), After that, the people put aside their candles and sit down for the Liturgy of the Word.\n\nThe Liturgy of the Word includes between three and seven readings from the [[Old Testament]], followed by two from the New (an Epistle and a Gospel). The Old Testament readings must include the account in Exodus 14 of the crossing of the Red Sea, seen as an antitype of baptism and Christian salvation. Each Old Testament reading is followed by a psalm or canticle (such as Exodus 15:1\u201318 and a prayer relating what has been read to the Mystery of Christ. After the Old Testament readings conclude, the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]], which has been suspended during Lent, is intoned and bells are rung\n\nA reading from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] is proclaimed. The [[Alleluia]] is sung for the first time since the beginning of Lent. The [[Gospel]] of the Resurrection then follows, along with a homily.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Liturgy of the Word, the water of the [[baptismal font]] is blessed and any [[catechumen]]s or candidates for full communion are initiated into the church, by [[baptism]] or [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]. After the celebration of these sacraments of initiation, the congregation renews their baptismal vows and receive the sprinkling of [[holy water|baptismal water]]. The general intercessions follow.\n\nAfter the Liturgy of Baptism, the Liturgy of the [[Eucharist]] continues as usual. This is the first Mass of Easter Day. During the Eucharist, the newly baptised receive Holy Communion for the first time. According to the rubrics of the [[Missal]], the Eucharist should finish before dawn.\n\n===Easter Day===\n{{Main|Easter}}\nEaster Day, which immediately follows Holy Week and begins with the Easter Vigil, is the great feast day and apogee of the Christian liturgical year: on this day the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated. It is the first day of the new season of the Great Fifty Days, or [[Eastertide]], which runs from Easter Day to [[Pentecost]] Sunday. The Resurrection of Christ on Easter Day is the main reason why Christians keep every Sunday as the primary day of religious observance.\n\n===Holy Week observances===\n{{Liturgical year}}\nCities famous for their [[Holy Week procession]]s include:\n\n[[File:Holy Week procession Livngston.jpg|thumb|250px|Holy Week procession in [[Livingston, Guatemala]]]]\n[[File:LimaHolyWeek20050002.jpg|thumb|250px|Holy Monday Procession in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\t\n|-\n!Country\n!City\n|-\n| Colombia\n| [[Santa Cruz de Mompox]]<br/> [[Popay\u00e1n]]<br/> [[Tunja]]<br/> [[Pamplona, Colombia|Pamplona]]\n|-\n| Costa Rica\n| [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]]<br/> [[Heredia, Costa Rica|Heredia]]<br/> [[Cartago, Costa Rica|San Rafael de Oreamuno]]\n|-\n| India \n|Mumbai\n Delhi \nChennai\n \nKolkata\n|-\n| Guatemala\n| [[Holy Week processions in Guatemala]]<br/> [[Antigua Guatemala]]<br/> [[Guatemala City]]\n|-\n| Honduras\n| [[Comayagua]]<br/> [[Tegucigalpa]]\n|-\n| El Salvador\n| [[Sonsonate, El Salvador|Sonsonate]]\n|-\n| Indonesia\n| [[Larantuka]]\n|-\n| Mexico\n|[[Holy Week in Mexico]]<br/> [[Passion Play of Iztapalapa|Iztapalapa]]\n|-\n| Nicaragua\n| [[Managua]]<br/> [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]]<br/> [[Le\u00f3n, Nicaragua|Le\u00f3n]]\n|-\n| Philippines\n| [[Angono, Rizal]]<br/> [[Antipolo]]<br/> [[Baguio]] <br/> [[Good Friday processions in Baliuag|Baliuag, Bulacan]] <br/> [[Bantayan Island]] \nCebu City<br/> [[Capas, Tarlac]] <br/> [[Guagua, Pampanga]]<br/> [[Iloilo City]] <br/> [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] <br/> [[Oas, Albay]] <br/> [[Makati]]<br/> [[Manila]] <br/> [[Manaoag, Pangasinan]] <br/> [[Meycauayan]] <br/> [[Morong, Rizal]]  <br/> [[Naga, Camarines Sur]] <br/> [[Paete, Laguna]]<br/> [[Para\u00f1aque]] <br/> [[San Pablo, Laguna]] <br/> [[Santa Rita, Pampanga]] <br/> [[Sasmuan, Pampanga]]<br/> [[Vigan]]<br/> [[Taguig]] <br/> [[Las Pi\u00f1as]] <br/> [[Olongapo City]] <br/> [[Zambales]]\n|- \n| Peru\n| [[Ayacucho]]<br/> [[Cusco]]<br/> [[Huaraz]]<br/> [[Tarma]]\n|-\n| Spain\n| [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]]<br/> [[Seville]]<br/> [[Valladolid]]<br/> [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]]<br/> [[Jerez de la Frontera]]<br/> [[Palencia]] <br/> [[M\u00e1laga]]<br/> [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]]<br/> [[C\u00e1diz]]<br/> [[Murcia]]<br/> [[Alicante]]<br/> [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] <br/> [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]]\n|-\n| Venezuela \n| [[Tacarigua de Mamporal]]<br/>[[Guatire]]<br/> [[Caracas]]<br/> [[Villa de Cura]]\n|-\n| Vietnam\n| [[:vi:Tu\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh|Tu\u1ea7n Th\u00e1nh]]\n|}\n\n\n==== Brazil ====\n[[File:Igreja Santo Ant\u00f4nio, Florian\u00f3polis, Brasil 000.JPG|thumb|250px|A church in [[Florian\u00f3polis]], Brazil, preparated for the Good Friday celebrations.]]\nHoly Week has developed into one of Brazil's main symbols of community identity, more specifically in the southern town of Campanha. The Campanha Holy Week begins on the Monday evening with the Procession of the Deposit. The figure of Our Lord of the Stations, representing the blood-stained Jesus carrying the cross, is brought from the church in a large black box and displayed in the main square. Then it is solemnly taken to the church following a band and a procession of people. Outside the church, a sermon is delivered on the Easter story of Jesus' death and resurrection. After the sermon, a choir inside the open doors of the church sings the [[Psalm 51|Miserere]] by Manoel Dias de Oliveria, while the black box is brought inside the church, and people come in to kiss the human-sized figure of Christ. Processions on Tuesday and Wednesday stop at different chapels at each of which a large painting portrays episodes of the Way of the Cross and a related hymn is sung at each. On Thursday morning the Chrism Mass is celebrated, with a blessing of the oils. Good Friday afternoon ceremonies are followed by the week's main spectacle of the Taking Down from the Cross in front of the cathedral followed by the Funeral Procession of Our Dead Lord. The drama shows Christ being taken from the cross and placed in a coffin, which is then taken around to the accompaniment of the \"Song of Veronica\". On Saturday morning a drama is performed by the youth. The following night, the Paschal Vigil is celebrated, and the streets are transformed into a beautiful array of intricate, colorful carpets to prepare for the following day. Easter Sunday begins before sunrise with the singing of the choir and band performances to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. Bells and fireworks are followed by a Mass that ends with the \"Hallelujah Chorus\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Ribeiro|first=Patricia|title=Easter in Brazil|url=http://gobrazil.about.com/od/festivalsevents/p/brazholyweek.htm|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Reily|first=Suzel Ana |title=Remembering the Baroque Era: Historical Consciousness, Local Identity and the Holy Week Celebrations in a Former Mining Town in Brazil |journal=Ethnomusicology Forum|date=June 2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=39\u201362|jstor=20184539}}</ref>\n\n==== Guatemala ====\nHoly Week in Guatemala incorporates processions with images of saints carried on huge wooden platforms. The heavy ''andas'' are held by the locals, both men and women, who are frequently in purple robes. The procession is led by a man holding a container of incense accompanied by a small horn and flute band. Intricate carpets (''alfombras'') line the streets during the week's celebration. Easter processions begin at sunrise and everyone comes to join the festivities.\n\nIn Amatenango, the figure of Judas, who betrayed Christ has been the main point of focus during the Mayan Holy Week. The priest calls Judas the \"killer of Christ\".  The figure used to be beaten after the Crucifixion performance on Good Friday, but is now treated more calmly.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|title=Guatemala: a Journey Through the Land of the Maya|year=2008|publisher=Purple Moon Publications; 1st edition|isbn=9780615210582}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Nash|first=June|title=Judas Transformed [Maya, Holy Week]|journal=Natural History|year=1994|volume=103|issue=3}}</ref>\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:Addolorata3.JPG|thumb|250px|Addolorata procession, [[Polistena]], [[Italy]]]]\nHoly Week is also observed in parts of Southern Italy, notably Sicily. The most famous is the Holy Week of [[Trapani]], culminating in the [[Processione dei Misteri di Trapani]] or simply the ''Misteri di Trapani'' (in English the ''Procession of the Mysteries of Trapani'' or the ''Mysteries of Trapani''), a day-long passion procession featuring twenty floats of lifelike wood, canvas and glue sculptures of individual scenes of the events of the Passion.\n\nThe Misteri are amongst the oldest continuously running religious events in Europe, having been played every Good Friday since before the Easter of 1612, and running for at least 16 continuous hours, but occasionally well beyond the 24 hours; they are the longest religious festival in Sicily and in Italy. Similar but smaller or shorter passion processions are held in many other Sicilian cities, like [[Erice]] and [[Caltanissetta]], but also in various Southern Italian cities, like [[Salerno]] and [[Taranto]].\n\n====Malta====\n{{Main|Holy Week in Malta}}\nThe Holy Week commemorations reach their paramount on Good Friday as the Catholic Church celebrates the passion of Jesus. Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]]. During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities. The Cross follows a significant Way of Jesus. Good Friday processions take place in [[Birgu]], [[Bormla]], [[G\u0127axaq]], [[Luqa]], [[Mosta]], [[Naxxar]], [[Paola, Malta|Paola]], [[Qormi]], [[Rabat]], [[Senglea]], [[Valletta]], [[\u017bebbu\u0121, Malta|\u017bebbu\u0121]] and [[\u017bejtun]].

The rituals date back to the early seventeenth century, at the time of pioneering [[Jesuit]] priest.<ref name=\"rimjournal\" /> The major event of the Yaqui Indians during Holy Week occurs on Wednesday evening in which people arrive at the church on horseback and begin to crawl and dance naked on the floor. Light begins to go out and people beguin the whipping, screaming and crying to the sound of traditional music of sacrifice. In [[Tucson]], dancers are used to wear dark coats and black hide masks, instead of blankets.<ref name=\"rimjournal\">{{cite web|url= http://www.rimjournal.com/arizyson/easter.htm/|title= Yaqui and Mayo Indian Easter ceremonies}}</ref>\n\nChildren in white robes with blue painted faces and a dark hooded figure, symbolizing the betrayer of Christ, join the Thursday morning procession to the church. There they promise to serve God for the next three or five years, until their eyes start to bleed just like Christ's would. That night, there is a symbolic search for Jesus when the \"Pharisees\" visit various crosses in the streets and capture the \"old man\" (symbolic Jesus). On Friday \na member of the church who volunteers to represent Jesus is beaten and buried for two days. On Saturday, an image of Jesus' betrayer, [[Judas Iscariot]], and takes place an [[apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] battle destroying the evil which has been accumulated in the town during the next year.<ref>{{cite web|\nurl= http://what-when-how.com/native-americans/yaqui-native-americans-of-the-southwest/|\ntitle= Yaqui (Native Americans of the Southwest)|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121201071204/http://what-when-how.com/native-americans/yaqui-native-americans-of-the-southwest/|archive-date= 1 December 2012|url-status=}}</ref> Sunday celebrates the Christ's resurrection filled with beautiful flowers and fireworks, while the volunteer rises from where he was buried.

Most stores are closed and most people in the cities return to their home provinces to commemorate Holy Week in their home town.\n\nHoly Week is commemorated with street processions featuring wheeled ''carrozas'' or floats carrying various icons, the [[Way of the Cross]], and a [[Passion play]] called the ''Sen\u00e1kulo''. In some communities (most famously in [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], [[Pampanga]]), the processions include devotees who self-flagellate and sometimes even have themselves nailed to crosses as expressions of penance. After 15:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]] on Good Friday (the time at which Jesus is traditionally believed to have died), noise is discouraged, many [[radio|radio stations]] and [[television|television stations]] [[closedown|close down]] (some broadcast religious programming, with non-Catholic owned stations continuing broadcast), and the faithful are urged to keep a solemn and prayerful disposition through to [[Easter]] Sunday.\n\nAt [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on [[Palm Sunday]], Catholics carry \"palasp\u00e1s\" or palm leaves to be blessed by the priest.  Many Filipinos bring home the palm leaves after the Mass and place these above their front doors or their windows, believing that doing so can ward off evil spirits. Holy Monday marks the beginning of the ''Pabasa'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], \"reading\"), the marathon chanting of the [[Pasyon|Pasy\u00f3n]], a [[poem]] narrating Jesus' life and death. The chanting, which continues day and night without interruption, lasts as long as two straight days.\n\nOne of the most important Holy Week traditions in the Philippines is the ''[[Seven Churches Visitation|Visita Iglesia]]'' (Spanish for \"church visit\").<ref name=PhilStar2015>{{cite news|last1=Vila|first1=Alixandra Caole|title=IN PHOTOS: A look at churches where Pinoys spend Visita Iglesia|url=http://www.philstar.com/travel-and-tourism/2015/04/02/1440184/photos-look-churches-where-pinoys-spend-visita-iglesia|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=philstar.com|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=2 April 2015}}</ref> On Maundy Thursday, the faithful visit seven churches to pray the [[Stations of the Cross]], and in the evenings, pray in front of each church's Altar of Repose.<ref name=GMA2015>{{cite news|last1=Bartolome|first1=Jessica|title=Doing the Visita Iglesia in Metro Manila|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/463006/lifestyle/artandculture/map-doing-the-visita-iglesia-in-metro-manila|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=GMA News|date=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe last Mass before [[Easter]] is also celebrated on Maundy Thursday, usually including a reenactment of the [[Washing of the Feet]] of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. This Mass is followed by the procession of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] to be transferred to the [[Altar of Repose]]. [[Good Friday]] in the Philippines is commemorated with street processions, the [[Way of the Cross]], the commemoration of Jesus' [[Seven last words]] (Siete Palabras) and a Passion play called the [[Passion play|Sinakulo]].\n\nEaster Day is marked with joyous celebration, the first being the dawn ''[[Salubong]]'' rite, wherein statues of Jesus and Mary are brought in procession together to meet, imagining the first reunion of Jesus and his mother Mary after Jesus' [[Resurrection]]. This is followed by the joyous Easter Mass. Most Catholic communities across the Philippines practice this, though it is more popularly celebrated in the provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/254165/lifestyle/artandculture/easter-salubong-rooted-in-culture-family-ties|title=Easter Salubong: Rooted in culture, family ties|website=GMA News Online|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref> The rite, originally called the ''encuentro'', was introduced by Spanish priests during the colonial era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/382513/faithful-rejoice-at-salubong|title=Faithful rejoice at 'salubong'|last=Tubeza|first=Philip C.|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Spain====\n{{Main|Holy Week in Spain}}\n[[File:Carroza de la visi\u00f3n de San Juan, conocida como \"la bola\", Paso Blanco, Semana Santa Lorca.jpg|thumb|Holy week in [[Lorca, Spain]]]]\n\n[[Cartagena (Spain)|Cartagena]], [[C\u00e1diz]], [[C\u00f3rdoba,_Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Murcia]], [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Seville]], [[Valladolid]], [[Palencia]], [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]] or [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] hold elaborate processions for Holy Week. A tradition dating from [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] that has spread to other cities in [[Andalusia]], the ''\"Semana Santa en Sevilla\"'' is notable for featuring the procession of '''\"pasos\"''', lifelike wood or plaster sculptures of individual scenes of the events that happened between Jesus's arrest and his burial, or images of the Virgin Mary showing grief for the torture and killing of her son. Holy week processions in Seville include marching bands that escort the pasos.<ref>Thomas M Landy, [https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/spain-marches-and-saetas-accompany-holy-week-processions \"In Seville Marches And Saetas Accompany Holy Week Processions\"], ''Catholics & Cultures'' updated 27 June 2018</ref>\n\nIn M\u00e1laga, the lifelike wooden or plaster sculptures are called \"tronos\" and they are carried through the streets by \"costaleros\" ( Translated literally as \"sack men\", because of the ''costal'', a sack-like cloth that they wear over their neck, to soften the burden). These pasos and tronos are physically carried on their necks or \"braceros\" (this name is popular in Leon). The paso can weigh up to five metric tonnes. In front of them walk the penitentes, dressed in long purple robes, often with pointed hats, followed by women in black carrying candles for up to 11 hours. The pasos are set up and maintained by ''hermandades'' and ''cofrad\u00edas'', religious brotherhoods that are common to a specific area of the city, whose precede the paso dressed in Roman military costumes or penitential robes.\n\nThose members who wish to do so wear these penitential robes with conical hats, or ''[[capirotes]]'', used to conceal the face of the wearer. These \"Nazarenos\" or \"Papones\" (this word is typical from Leon) carry processional candles, may walk the city streets barefoot, and may carry shackles and chains in their feet as penance. A brass band, marching band, a drum and bugle band, or in the cases of [[Cartagena (Spain)|Cartagena]] and M\u00e1laga a military band (such as that of the [[Spanish Legion]] or other military units) may accompany the group, playing funeral marches, hymns or \"marchas\" written for the occasion.\n\n===Music===\n{{listen\n | filename    = Tomas Luis de Victoria O vos omnes (The Tudor Consort).ogg\n | title       = Fifth responsory for Holy Saturday\n | description = [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]'s ''[[O vos omnes]]'' performed live by [[The Tudor Consort]] (2003)\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nMusic for the Holy Week includes [[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]], [[Responsories for Holy Week]], [[Passion oratorio]]s and [[Easter oratorio]]s.\n\n[[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]'s ''Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae'' (1585) contains settings of 37 texts for the [[Catholic liturgy]] of the Holy Week. [[Carlo Gesualdo]]'s ''[[Responsoria et alia ad Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae spectantia]]'' (1611) contains settings of all 27 [[Tenebrae]] responsories (for [[matins]] of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday), and of a few other text for use in [[lauds]] of the Holy Week. ''[[Le\u00e7ons de t\u00e9n\u00e8bres]]'' as composed by various French baroque composers were usually intended for performance during the evening of [[Holy Wednesday]], Maundy Thursday and Good Friday.\n\n==Holy Week in Eastern Christianity==\n\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\nIn the [[Orthodox Church]], the forty days of [[Great Lent]] end on the Friday before Palm Sunday. The two days that follow, [[Lazarus Saturday]] and [[Palm Sunday]], form a transition to Holy Week, neither in Lent nor in Holy Week themselves, but in combination with Holy Week containing the continuing observances in preparation for [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter), during which the faithful continue to fast.\n\nLazarus Saturday commemorates Jesus' [[Raising of Lazarus|raising]] of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead, just before he went to Jerusalem himself. The main themes anticipate the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], showing him as master over death. On this day wine and oil are allowed (and, in the Russian tradition, [[caviar]]), lightening the fast by one degree. Palm Sunday is considered one of the [[Great Feasts]] of the Lord, and is celebrated with fish, wine and oil, the lightest degree of fasting, in observance of the festival. Because it is a Great Feast of the Lord, the normal resurrectional elements of the Sunday [[Canonical hours|liturgies]] are omitted. However, some of these resurrectional elements are found in the Lazarus Saturday liturgy.\n\nHoly Week is referred to as \"Great and Holy Week\", or \"Passion Week\".<ref>Triodion (standard Orthodox service book)</ref> Since the Orthodox liturgical day starts at sunset (as it has from antiquity), Holy Monday liturgies begin Sunday evening, at the normal timing for Monday Vespers (Vespers is the first liturgy of the day). However, during Holy Week, in most parishes, many liturgy times are advanced from six to twelve hours in time and celebrated in anticipation, which permits more of the faithful to attend the most prominent liturgies. Thus, it is the [[Matins#Eastern Christianity|matins]] liturgy of Great Monday that is on \"Palm Sunday\" evening in parish churches and often [[vespers]] is in the morning.\n\n[[Fasting]] during Great and Holy Week is very strict, as in Lent at a minimum: dairy products and meat products are strictly forbidden, and on most days, no alcoholic beverages are permitted and no oil is used in cooking.  Holy Friday and Holy Saturday especially may exceed Lenten norms. Those who can, including monastics, observe them as days of abstention, meaning that nothing is eaten on those days. However, fasting is always adjusted to the needs of the individual, and those who are very young, ill or elderly are not expected to fast as strictly. Those who are able may receive the blessing of their [[spiritual father]] to observe an even stricter fast, whereby they eat only two meals that week: one on Wednesday night and one after [[Divine Liturgy]] on Thursday.\n\n====Great and Holy Monday through Wednesday====\n{{Main|Holy Monday|Holy Tuesday|Holy Wednesday}}\n[[File:5208-20080122-1255UTC--jerusalem-calvary.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of Christ the Bridegroom, sitting above the star at [[Golgotha]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nA new liturgical day beginning at sunset, the first liturgy of each day is [[vespers]] at which [[sticheron|stichera]] are chanted elaborating the theme of the new day.\n\nThese days' Orthros liturgies (which in parishes is performed the previous night) are often referred to as the \"Bridegroom Prayer\", because of their theme of Christ as the Bridegroom of the Church, a theme expressed in the [[troparion]] that is solemnly chanted during them. On these days, an [[icon]] of the \"Bridegroom\" is placed on an [[analogion]] in the center of the [[temple]], portraying Jesus wearing the purple [[robe]] of mockery and crowned with a [[crown of thorns]] (see [[Instruments of the Passion]]).\n\nThe same theme is repeated in the [[exapostilarion]], a hymn which occurs near the end of the liturgy. These liturgies follow much the same pattern as liturgies on weekdays of [[Great Lent]]. The liturgies are so laid out that the entire [[Psalter]] (with the exception of [[Kathisma]] XVII) is chanted on the first three days of Holy Week. The [[canon (hymnography)|canon]] that is chanted on these days is a \"Triode\", i.e., composed of three [[ode]]s instead of the usual nine, as is in other weekday liturgies in the [[Triodion]].\n\nTowards the end of the Tuesday evening Bridegroom liturgy (Orthros for Great and Holy Wednesday), the ''[[Kassia|Hymn of Kassiani]]'' is sung. The [[hymn]], (written in the 9th century by [[Kassia]]) tells of the woman who washed Christ's feet in the house of [[Simon the Pharisee]] ({{bibleverse||Luke|7:36-50|KJV}}). Much of the hymn is written from the perspective of the sinful woman:\n\n<blockquote>O Lord, the woman who had fallen into many sins, sensing Your Divinity, takes upon herself the duty of a myrrh-bearer. With lamentations she brings you myrrh in anticipation of your entombment. \"Woe to me!\" she cries, \"for me night has become a frenzy of licentiousness, a dark and moonless love of sin. Receive the fountain of my tears, O You who gathers into clouds the waters of the sea. Incline unto me,  unto the sighings of my heart, O You who bowed the heavens by your ineffable condescension. I will wash your immaculate feet with kisses and dry them again with the tresses of my hair; those very feet at whose sound Eve hid herself from in fear when she heard You walking in Paradise in the twilight of the day. As for the multitude of my sins and the depths of Your judgements, who can search them out, O Savior of souls, my Savior? Do not disdain me Your handmaiden, O You who are boundless in mercy.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn vespers at the end of Monday through Wednesday is a reading from the Gospel which sets forth the new day's theme and then the [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] may be celebrated.\n\nThe Byzantine musical composition expresses the poetry so strongly that it leaves many people in a state of prayerful tears. The Hymn can last upwards of 25 minutes and is liturgically and musically a highpoint of the entire year.\n\n====Great and Holy Thursday====\n{{Main|Holy Thursday}}\n[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|An Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]])]]\n\nIn many churches, especially Greek Orthodox, a liturgy of [[Anointing]] ([[Holy Unction]]) is held on Wednesday evening, following the Presanctified Liturgy. This is in commemoration of the [[anointing of Jesus]], and a preparation of the faithful to enter with Christ into his death and Resurrection. Those who wish to receive [[Holy Communion]] on Great and Holy Thursday, are encouraged to receive the [[Holy Mystery]] of Unction.\n\nOrthros of Great and Holy Thursday does not follow the format of Great Lent (with the singular exception of chanting [[Alleluia]] in place of [[God is the Lord]]), but is celebrated as outside Lent, having a complete canon. Also, beginning at this liturgy there will be no more reading of the psalter for the rest of Holy Week, with the exception of [[kathisma]] XVII at Orthros of Great and Holy Saturday.\n\nDivine Liturgy of the [[Last Supper]] is held on the morning of Great and Holy Thursday, combining Vespers with the [[Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great]]. There is a custom among some churches to place a simple white linen cloth over the [[Holy Table]] (altar) for this Liturgy, reminiscent of the Last Supper. In cathedrals and [[monastery|monasteries]] it is customary for the [[bishop]] or [[hegumen]] (abbot) to celebrate the [[Washing of Feet]]. When it is necessary for an [[autocephalous]] church to consecrate more [[chrysm]] the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of that church will consecrate it at this Liturgy.\n\nGreat and Holy Thursday is the only day during Holy Week when those observing the strict tradition will eat a cooked meal, though they will not do so until after the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of the Liturgy. At this meal wine and oil are permitted, but the faithful still abstain from meat and dairy products.\n\n====Great and Holy Friday====\n{{Main|Good Friday}}\nMatins of Great and Holy Friday is celebrated on the evening of Holy Thursday. During this liturgy, twelve [[Matins Gospel]]s are chanted, from which this liturgy derives its name of \"Matins of the Twelve Gospels\".  These Gospel lessons recount in chronological order the events from the Last Supper though the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Burial of Jesus|burial]] of Jesus. At one point, when we reach the first Gospel which speaks of the Crucifixion, there is a custom for the priest to bring out a large [[crucifix|cross]] with an [[icon]] the crucified Christ attached to it, and places it in the center of the [[nave]] for all the faithful to venerate. This cross will remain in the center of the church until the bringing out of the [[epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]] the next evening.\n\nOn Great and Holy Friday morning the [[Royal Hours]] are served. These are a solemn celebration of the [[Little Hours]] with added hymns and readings.\n\n[[File:Hautausikoni.jpg|thumb|250px|The Epitaphios (Plashchanitza) placed in the [[nave]] of the church for the faithful to venerate. The [[Gospel Book]] rests in the center.]]\n\nVespers of Great and Holy Friday (Vespers of the [[Deposition from the Cross]]) is held in the morning or early afternoon of Great and Holy Friday. The figure of Christ is taken down from the Cross, and a richly embroidered cloth icon called the ''[[Epitaphios (liturgy)|Epitaphios]]'' ([[Church Slavonic]]: ''Plashchanitza'') depicting Christ prepared for burial is laid in a \"[[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]]\" decorated with flowers. At the end of the liturgy all come forward to venerate the Epitaphios.\n\n[[Compline]] of Great and Holy Friday contains a Canon of Lamentations of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mother of God]]).\n\n====Great and Holy Saturday====\n{{Main|Holy Saturday}}\n[[File:Epitaphios Procession Beginning at Great Saturday Mattins.jpg|thumb|250px|Beginning of the epitaphios procession at Great Saturday Mattins]]\n\nMatins of Great and Holy Saturday is, in parish practice, held on Friday evening. The liturgy is known as the \"Orthros of [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Lamentations at the Tomb]]\", because the majority of the liturgy is composed of the clergy and faithful gathered around the tomb, chanting the \"Lamentations\" interspersed between the verses of Kathisma XVII ([[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]]). At a certain point the priest sprinkles the tomb with rose petals and [[rose water]]. Near the end of the liturgy, the Epitaphios is carried in a candlelit procession around the outside of the church as the faithful sing the [[Trisagion]].\n\n[[Vespers]] joined to the [[Divine Liturgy]] is served on Great and Holy Saturday, prescribed by the Liturgical books to be served in the afternoon but often served in the morning.  This is the ''Proti Anastasi'' (First Resurrection) liturgy, commemorating the [[Harrowing of Hell]]. Just before the reading of the Gospel, the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] and changed from dark lenten colors to white, and the entire mood of the liturgy changes from mourning to joy. However, the faithful do not yet greet one another with the [[Paschal kiss]], since the Resurrection has not yet been announced to the living.\n\nIf there are [[catechumens]] who are prepared for [[baptism]] they are baptized and [[chrismation|chrismated]] during the Old Testament readings.\n\n[[File:Receiving the Holy Light at Easter.jpg|thumb|250px|People receiving the Holy Light at Easter from Father Diogenis at St George Greek Orthodox Church [[Adelaide]]]]\n\nOn Saturday night, the [[Paschal Vigil]] begins around 11:00&nbsp;pm with the chanting of the [[Midnight Office]]. Afterwards, all of the lighting in the church is extinguished and all remain in silence and darkness until the stroke of midnight. Then, the priest lights a single candle from the [[eternal flame]] on the altar (which is never extinguished). The light is spread from person to person until everyone holds a lighted candle.\n\nA procession then circles around the outside of the church, recreating the journey of the [[Myrrh Bearers]] as they journeyed to the [[Tomb of Jesus]] on the first Easter morning. The procession stops in front of the closed doors of the church. The opening of these doors symbolized the \"rolling away of the stone\" from the tomb by the angel, and all enter the church joyfully singing the [[Troparion]] of [[Easter|Pascha]]. Paschal Orthros begins with an [[Ektenia]] (litany) and the chanting of the Paschal [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]].\n\nOne of the highpoints is the sharing of the [[paschal kiss]] and the reading of the ''[[Paschal Homily|Hieratikon]]'' ([[Catechism|Catechetical]] [[Homily]] of [[John Chrysostom]]) by the priest. The Divine Liturgy follows, and every Orthodox Christian is encouraged to [[Confession (religion)|confess]] and receive [[Holy Communion]] on this holiest day of the year. A [[breakfast]] usually follows, sometimes lasting till dawn. Slavs bring [[Easter basket]]s filled with eggs, meat, butter, and cheese\u2014foods from which the faithful have abstained during [[Great Lent]]\u2014to be blessed by the priest which are then taken back home to be shared by family and friends with joy.\n\nOn the afternoon of Easter Day, a joyful liturgy called \"[[Agape feast|Agape]] Vespers\" is celebrated. During this liturgy, the [[Prokeimenon|Great Prokeimenon]] is chanted and a lesson from the Gospel ({{bibleverse||John|20:19-25|KJV}}) is read in as many different languages as possible, accompanied by the joyful ringing of bells.\n\n===Coptic Orthodox Church===\nThe Coptic Orthodox Christians fast the Lent for 55 days including the Holy Week which they call Holy Paschal Week.<ref>http://www.zeitun-eg.org/paschag2.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Friday before Palm Sunday is called \"The Concluding Friday of Great Lent\". On this day a special liturgy called \"The Unction of the Sick\" is conducted. It consists of seven prayers and at the conclusion of the prayers, the priest anoints each member of the congregation with the holy oil.\n\nThe following day \u2013 the last Saturday before Holy Week \u2013 is called \"Lazarus' Saturday\". On this day the Coptic Church commemorates [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], the brother of [[Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany]]. This day is related to the events of Holy Week in that John 12 tells of a visit of Jesus to Lazarus immediately before recounting the events of Palm Sunday.\n\nSince the liturgical day starts from the evening before a calendar day, the prayers of Palm Sunday begin on the evening of Lazarus' Saturday.\n\nThroughout Holy Week, a paschal liturgy is conducted each evening, starting on Sunday night (the eve of Monday), and every morning, up until Easter. These paschal liturgies take place in the middle of the church, not on the altar, because Jesus suffered and was crucified on Golgotha, outside of Jerusalem. The altar is bared of all its coverings and relics.\n\nEach day liturgy is divided into 5 \"hours\"; The First Hour, The Third Hour, The Sixth Hour, The Ninth Hour, and The Eleventh Hour.\nLikewise, each night liturgy is also divided into the same five hours. However, Good Friday has an extra hour added to it, that of The Twelfth Hour.\nDuring each hour, one prophecy is read at the beginning, a hymn is chanted twelve times, a psalm is sung in a sad tune, one passage from a gospel is read, and an exposition concludes the hour.\nDuring the eve of Friday, four gospel passages are read, and more prophecies are read as well.\nFrom Tuesday night onward, the people do not greet each other nor the priests, and do not even kiss the icons of saints in the church, because it was with a kiss that Judas betrayed Jesus.\n\nOn Thursday of Holy Week, also called Covenant Thursday, a liturgy is prayed and communion is given to symbolize the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus. Also, before the liturgy the priests wash the feet of the congregation in imitation of Jesus washing his disciples' feet.\n\nLate Friday night until early Saturday morning is called Apocalypse Night. During this night, another liturgy is prayed and the entire [[Book of the Apocalypse]] is read, to symbolize the [[Second Coming]].\n\nThe series concludes with the Easter liturgy on Saturday night, followed by a gathering in the church where the participants can celebrate the joy of the resurrection, eating together and ending their long fast, and at which they are permitted once again to partake of meat, fish, and dairy products.\n\n===Eastern Catholic Churches===\nEastern Catholic Churches' Holy Week observances and customs are generally the same as in the rites of the corresponding Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox Church or Assyrian Church of the East.\n\n==Related observances==\n===Friday of Sorrows===\n{{Main|Friday of Sorrows}}\nThe religious processions that are part of the Holy Week celebrations in many countries begin two days before Holy Week on what in those countries is called Friday of Sorrows.\n\nOn the Friday before Holy Week, the [[Roman Rite]] celebrated universally from 1727 to 1969 a liturgical feast of the [[Seven Sorrows of Mary]]. Celebration of this feast began in Germany but spread to many other countries even before [[Pope Benedict XIII]] made it a universal feast, assigning it to the Friday before Palm Sunday. Another feast with the same name was and still is celebrated in September.<ref>{{Catholic Encyclopedia|no-icon=1|prescript=|first=Frederick|last=Holweck|wstitle=Feasts of the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary}}</ref> With his [[Code of Rubrics]] of 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]] reduced the feast on the Friday of what was then called Passion Week (the week before Holy Week) to the level of a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]], and in 1969 the celebration was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]] as a duplicate of the September feast.<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1969). p.119</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 2002 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] provides an alternative [[collect]] for this Friday:<ref>Roman Missal, Friday of the Fifth Week of Lent</ref>\n<blockquote><poem>\nO God, who in this season\ngive your Church the grace\nto imitate devoutly the Blessed Virgin Mary\nin contemplating the Passion of Christ,\ngrant, we pray, through her intercession,\nthat we may cling more firmly each day\nto your Only Begotten Son\nand come at last to the fullness of his grace.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThis provision of an alternative collect was the equivalent of granting the Lenten celebration of Our Lady of Sorrow the rank of [[memorial (liturgy)|memorial]], since during Lent a memorial, even if otherwise obligatory, is represented in the liturgy of the day at most by optional use of its collect.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20030317_ordinamento-messale_en.html General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 355] and [https://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Calendar/Info/GNLY.pdf Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the General Roman Calendar, 14]</ref> The liturgical calendar of [[Malta]] gives the celebration the rank of feast, making its observance obligatory. Observance of the Tridentine Mass calendar as it stood in 1962 is still permitted in the circumstances indicated in the 2007 document ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', giving Our Lady of Sorrows a [[commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]] within the liturgy of the Friday.\n\nIn many [[Latin American]] countries, such as [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Peru]], as well as in [[Spain]] and the Philippines, this Friday feast of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is called ''Viernes de Dolores'' ([[Friday of Sorrows]]). It is sometimes also referred to as \"Council Friday\", because of the choice of John 11:47\u201354 as the Gospel passage read in the [[Tridentine Mass]] on that day (which is now read in slightly expanded form on Saturday of the fifth week of Lent), which recounts the meeting of the [[Sanhedrin]] to discuss what to do with Jesus. Its date is exactly a week before [[Good Friday]].\n\nThe somber and often nocturnal commemoration with public processions directs thoughts to the desolate emotional state of the Virgin Mary on Black Saturday as prophesied by the Rabbi Simeon on the \"seven sorrows\" that as an allegorical sword pierced her heart. She is represented as worrying and grieving with Saint [[Mary Magdalene]] for Jesus; therefore the event is markedly similar to a [[mourning]] event among the people.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Divine Mercy Sunday]]\n*[[Holy Week in Mexico]]\n*[[Holy Week in Spain]]\n*[[Holy Week in the Philippines]]\n*[[Holy Week procession]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n<ref>Thomas M Landy, [https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/brazil/holy-week-ouro-preto \"Holy Week in Ouro Preto\"], ''Catholics & Cultures'' updated 5 May 2016</ref>\n\n{{Commons category}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Liturgical year of the Catholic Church}}\n{{Easter}}\n* {{cite web|url= https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=igeo%2bpassion%2bplace&view=detail&mid=5FD1243F2D09F3B2EA845FD1243F2D09F3B2EA84&FORM=VRRTAP|title= The historical places of the Holy Week|language= es|publisher= igeo.tv}}\n\n[[Category:Divine Mercy]]\n[[Category:Easter liturgy]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox liturgical days]]\n[[Category:Holy Week]]\n[[Category:Religious events]]\n[[Category:Weeks]]\n[[Category:days]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Calendar date}}\n{{Redirect|Passion Week|its uncommon use to describe the week before Holy Week|Passiontide#Passion Week{{!}}Passion Week}}\n{{other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2019}}\n{{Infobox holiday\n| holiday_name = Holy Week\n| type         = Christian\n| longtype     = [[Christianity|Christian]]\n| image        = Folio 173v - The Entry into Jerusalem.jpg\n| image_size   = 250px\n| caption      = The [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|entry of Jesus and His disciples into Jerusalem]] on [[Palm Sunday]] marks the beginning of Holy Week, the last week of [[Lent]].\n| date         = Last week of Lent\n| duration     = 7 days\n| frequency    = Annual\n| date{{LASTYEAR}}    = {{Moveable date|holiday=Holy Week|year={{LASTYEAR}}|format=infobox}} (Western)\n| date{{CURRENTYEAR}} = {{Moveable date|holiday=Holy Week|year={{CURRENTYEAR}}|format=infobox|cite=y}}\n| date{{NEXTYEAR}}    = {{Moveable date|holiday=Holy Week|year={{NEXTYEAR}}|format=infobox}}\n| date{{NEXTYEAR|2}}  = {{Moveable date|holiday=Holy week|year={{NEXTYEAR|2}}|format=infobox}}\n| observances  = Church attendance\n| relatedto    = [[Eastertide]]\n}}\n{{Death of Jesus}}\n\nIn [[Christianity]], '''Holy Week''' ([[Latin]]: {{lang|la|Hebdomas Sancta}} or {{lang|la|Hebdomas Maior}}, {{lit}} 'Greater Week'; {{lang-el|\u1f09\u03b3\u03af\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u1f19\u03b2\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c2|translit=Hagia kai Megale Hebdomas|lit=Holy and Great Week}}) is the week immediately preceding [[Easter]].

The earliest allusion to the custom of marking this week as a whole with special observances is to be found in the [[Apostolical Constitutions]] (v. 18, 19), dating from the latter half of the 3rd century and 4th century. In this text, abstinence from flesh is commanded for all the days, while for the Friday and Saturday an [[Black Fast|absolute fast]] is commanded. Dionysius Alexandrinus in his canonical epistle (AD 260), refers to the 91 fasting days implying that the observance of them had already become an established usage in his time.<ref>Apostolical Constitutions v. 18, 19</ref>\n\nThere is some doubt about the genuineness of an ordinance attributed to Roman Emperor [[Constantine I|Constantine]], in which abstinence from public business was enforced for the seven days immediately preceding [[Easter Day]], and also for the seven which followed it. The ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'', however, is explicit in ordering that all actions at law should cease, and the doors of all courts of law be closed during those 15 days (1. ii. tit. viii.).\n\nOf the particular days of the \"great week\" the earliest to emerge into special prominence was naturally Good Friday. Next came the ''Sabbatum Magnum'' (\"Great Sabbath\", i.e., [[Holy Saturday]] or Easter Eve) with its [[Paschal vigil|vigil]], which in the [[early church]] was associated with an expectation that the [[second advent]] would occur on an Easter Day.\n\nOther writings that refer to related traditions of the early Church include, most notably, ''The Pilgrimage of Etheria'' (also known as ''The Pilgrimage of [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]]''), which details the whole observance of Holy Week at that time.\n\nToday, in the [[Western Christian Church]], among Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists, Presbyterians and Catholics, the liturgies used for Holy Week are nearly identical.<ref name=\"Ramshaw2004\">{{cite book|last=Ramshaw|first=Gail|title=The Three-Day Feast: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Easter|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tbb9axN6qFwC&pg=PA7|accessdate=13 April 2014|year=2004|publisher=Augsburg Books|quote=Many Christians are already familiar with the ancient, and now recently restored, liturgies of the Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the great Easter Vigil service of light, readings, baptism, and communion.

Traditionally, Palm Sunday commemorates the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem]] described in all four [[canonical gospel]]s.  As described in the accounts, Jesus's entry into Jerusalem was noted by the crowds present who shouted praises and waved [[Palm branch (symbol)|palm branches]]. In the Roman Rite, before 1955 it was known simply as Palm Sunday, and the preceding Sunday as Passion Sunday. From 1955 to 1971 it was called Second Sunday in [[Passiontide]] or Palm Sunday.

The blessing ceremony includes the reading of a Gospel account of how Jesus rode into Jerusalem humbly on a donkey, reminiscent of a Davidic victory procession, and how people placed palms and other branches on the ground in front of him. Immediately following this great time of celebration over the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, he begins his journey to the cross. The blessing is thus followed by a procession or solemn entrance into the church, with the participants holding the blessed branches in their hands. The Mass or liturgy of worship itself includes a reading of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]], the narrative of Jesus' capture, sufferings and death, as recounted in one of the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. (In the [[Tridentine Mass]] the Passion narrative read on this day is always that of St. Matthew.)\n\nBefore the reform of the rite by [[Pope Pius XII]], the blessing of the palms occurred inside the church within a liturgy that followed the general outline of a Mass, with Collect, Epistle and Gospel, as far as the Sanctus. The palms were then blessed with five prayers, and a procession went out of the church and on its return included a ceremony for the reopening of the doors, which had meantime been shut. After this the normal Mass was celebrated.<ref name=prePXII>[http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/missale-romanum.pdf 1920 typical edition of the Roman Missal]</ref>\n\nMany churches of mainstream [[Christian denominations]], including the Lutheran, Catholic, Methodist, Anglican, Moravian and Reformed traditions, distribute palm branches to their congregations during their Palm Sunday liturgies. Christians take these palms, which are often blessed by clergy, to their homes where they hang them alongside [[Christian art]] (especially [[Christian cross|crosses]] and [[crucifix]]es) or keep them in their Bibles or devotionals.<ref name=\"Kirk2018\">{{cite web |last1=Kirk |first1=Lisa |title=Ideas for Displaying Palm Sunday Palms Around Your Home |url=https://blessedisshe.net/blog/palm-sunday-palms/ |publisher=Blessed Is She |accessdate=4 April 2020 |language=English |date=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Holy Monday and Holy Tuesday===\n[[File:Catholic_Tenebrae_service.jpg|thumb|left|A Tenebrae liturgy held at a Roman Catholic parish church on Spy Wednesday (2019)]]\nThe days between Palm Sunday and Maundy Thursday are known as [[Holy Monday]], [[Holy Tuesday]], and [[Spy Wednesday]] (Holy Wednesday).

As the [[Sabbath day]], the Gospel accounts all note that Jesus was hurriedly buried in a cave tomb after his crucifixion, with the intent to finish proper embalming and burial ceremonies on Sunday, after the Sabbath had ended, as the Sabbath day prohibitions would have prevented observant Jews from completing a proper burial.  While daytime liturgies or commemorations of the day are rare in the Western tradition, after sundown on Holy Saturday is the traditional time for [[Easter Vigil]].\n\nIn the Catholic tradition, Mass is not celebrated on what is liturgically Holy Saturday. The celebration of [[Easter]] begins after sundown on what, though still Saturday in the civil calendar, is liturgically Easter Sunday.\n{{Quote|On Holy Saturday the Church waits at the Lord's tomb in prayer and fasting, meditating on his Passion and Death and on his Descent into Hell, and awaiting his Resurrection.<br/>The Church abstains from the Sacrifice of the Mass, with the sacred table left bare, until after the solemn Vigil, that is, the anticipation by night of the Resurrection, when the time comes for paschal joys, the abundance of which overflows to occupy fifty days.<ref>Roman Missal, Holy Saturday</ref>}}\n\nIn some Anglican churches, including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States]], there is provision for a simple liturgy of the word with readings commemorating the burial of Christ.\n\nThe tabernacle is left empty and open.  The lamp or candle usually situated next to the tabernacle denoting the Presence of Christ is put out, and the remaining [[Eucharist]]ic Hosts consecrated on Holy Thursday are kept elsewhere, usually the [[sacristy]], with a lamp or candle burning before it, so that, in cases of the danger of death, they may be given as ''[[viaticum]]''.\n\n===Easter Vigil===\n{{Main|Easter Vigil}}\n[[File:Praecentor.JPG|thumb|right|Lutheran deacon holding the [[Paschal candle]] during the Easter Vigil]]\n\nThe name of the Easter Vigil, even if the [[vigil]] is held on what on the civil calendar is still Saturday, indicates that liturgically it is already Easter, no longer part of Holy Week, but still part of the Easter Triduum.\n\nIn the Anglican, Lutheran, Catholic, Methodist, and Presbyterian traditions, the Easter Vigil, one of the longest and most solemn of liturgical liturgies, lasts up to three or four hours, consists of four parts:<ref name=\"Ramshaw2004\"/><ref name=\"Jr.2002\">{{cite book|title=Presbyterian Worship: A Guide for Clergy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gNiHA25B2WQC&pg=PA102|accessdate=13 April 2014|year=2002|publisher=Geneva Press|isbn=9780664502188|page=102|quote=The Easter Vigil consists of four parts: the Service of Light, the service of Readings (the Word), the celebration of Baptism, and the celebration of the Lord's Supper.|author=J.

In the darkness (often in a side chapel of the church building or, preferably, outside the church), a new fire is kindled and blessed by the priest. This new fire symbolizes the light of salvation and hope that God brought into the world through Christ's Resurrection, dispelling the darkness of sin and death. From this fire is lit the [[Paschal candle]], symbolizing the Light of Christ. This Paschal candle will be used throughout the season of Easter, remaining in the sanctuary of the Church or near the lectern, and throughout the coming year at baptisms and funerals, reminding all that Christ is \"light and life.\"\n\n[[File:Osternacht.jpg|thumb|250px|Candles lit for the Easter Vigil at [[Heiligenkreuz Abbey]] in Austria]]\nThe candles of those present are lit from the Paschal candle. As this symbolic \"Light of Christ\" spreads throughout those gathered, the darkness is decreased. A deacon, or the priest if there is no deacon, carries the Paschal Candle at the head of the entrance procession and, at three points, stops and chants the proclamation \"The Light of Christ\" (until Easter 2011, the official English text was \"Christ our Light\"), to which the people respond \"Thanks be to God.\" Once the procession concludes with the singing of the third proclamation, the lights throughout the church are lit, except for the altar candles. Then the deacon or a cantor chants the [[Exultet]] (also called the \"Easter Proclamation\"), After that, the people put aside their candles and sit down for the Liturgy of the Word.\n\nThe Liturgy of the Word includes between three and seven readings from the [[Old Testament]], followed by two from the New (an Epistle and a Gospel). The Old Testament readings must include the account in Exodus 14 of the crossing of the Red Sea, seen as an antitype of baptism and Christian salvation. Each Old Testament reading is followed by a psalm or canticle (such as Exodus 15:1\u201318 and a prayer relating what has been read to the Mystery of Christ. After the Old Testament readings conclude, the [[Gloria in excelsis Deo]], which has been suspended during Lent, is intoned and bells are rung\n\nA reading from the [[Epistle to the Romans]] is proclaimed. The [[Alleluia]] is sung for the first time since the beginning of Lent. The [[Gospel]] of the Resurrection then follows, along with a homily.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the Liturgy of the Word, the water of the [[baptismal font]] is blessed and any [[catechumen]]s or candidates for full communion are initiated into the church, by [[baptism]] or [[Confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]]. After the celebration of these sacraments of initiation, the congregation renews their baptismal vows and receive the sprinkling of [[holy water|baptismal water]]. The general intercessions follow.\n\nAfter the Liturgy of Baptism, the Liturgy of the [[Eucharist]] continues as usual. This is the first Mass of Easter Day. During the Eucharist, the newly baptised receive Holy Communion for the first time. According to the rubrics of the [[Missal]], the Eucharist should finish before dawn.\n\n===Easter Day===\n{{Main|Easter}}\nEaster Day, which immediately follows Holy Week and begins with the Easter Vigil, is the great feast day and apogee of the Christian liturgical year: on this day the Resurrection of Jesus Christ is celebrated. It is the first day of the new season of the Great Fifty Days, or [[Eastertide]], which runs from Easter Day to [[Pentecost]] Sunday.

The Campanha Holy Week begins on the Monday evening with the Procession of the Deposit. The figure of Our Lord of the Stations, representing the blood-stained Jesus carrying the cross, is brought from the church in a large black box and displayed in the main square. Then it is solemnly taken to the church following a band and a procession of people. Outside the church, a sermon is delivered on the Easter story of Jesus' death and resurrection. After the sermon, a choir inside the open doors of the church sings the [[Psalm 51|Miserere]] by Manoel Dias de Oliveria, while the black box is brought inside the church, and people come in to kiss the human-sized figure of Christ. Processions on Tuesday and Wednesday stop at different chapels at each of which a large painting portrays episodes of the Way of the Cross and a related hymn is sung at each. On Thursday morning the Chrism Mass is celebrated, with a blessing of the oils. Good Friday afternoon ceremonies are followed by the week's main spectacle of the Taking Down from the Cross in front of the cathedral followed by the Funeral Procession of Our Dead Lord. The drama shows Christ being taken from the cross and placed in a coffin, which is then taken around to the accompaniment of the \"Song of Veronica\". On Saturday morning a drama is performed by the youth. The following night, the Paschal Vigil is celebrated, and the streets are transformed into a beautiful array of intricate, colorful carpets to prepare for the following day. Easter Sunday begins before sunrise with the singing of the choir and band performances to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. Bells and fireworks are followed by a Mass that ends with the \"Hallelujah Chorus\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Ribeiro|first=Patricia|title=Easter in Brazil|url=http://gobrazil.about.com/od/festivalsevents/p/brazholyweek.htm|accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Reily|first=Suzel Ana |title=Remembering the Baroque Era: Historical Consciousness, Local Identity and the Holy Week Celebrations in a Former Mining Town in Brazil |journal=Ethnomusicology Forum|date=June 2006|volume=15|issue=1|pages=39\u201362|jstor=20184539}}</ref>\n\n==== Guatemala ====\nHoly Week in Guatemala incorporates processions with images of saints carried on huge wooden platforms.

Similar but smaller or shorter passion processions are held in many other Sicilian cities, like [[Erice]] and [[Caltanissetta]], but also in various Southern Italian cities, like [[Salerno]] and [[Taranto]].\n\n====Malta====\n{{Main|Holy Week in Malta}}\nThe Holy Week commemorations reach their paramount on Good Friday as the Catholic Church celebrates the passion of Jesus. Solemn celebrations take place in all churches together with processions in different villages around [[Malta]] and [[Gozo]]. During the celebration, the narrative of the passion is read in some localities. The Cross follows a significant Way of Jesus.

Most stores are closed and most people in the cities return to their home provinces to commemorate Holy Week in their home town.\n\nHoly Week is commemorated with street processions featuring wheeled ''carrozas'' or floats carrying various icons, the [[Way of the Cross]], and a [[Passion play]] called the ''Sen\u00e1kulo''. In some communities (most famously in [[City of San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]], [[Pampanga]]), the processions include devotees who self-flagellate and sometimes even have themselves nailed to crosses as expressions of penance. After 15:00 [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]] on Good Friday (the time at which Jesus is traditionally believed to have died), noise is discouraged, many [[radio|radio stations]] and [[television|television stations]] [[closedown|close down]] (some broadcast religious programming, with non-Catholic owned stations continuing broadcast), and the faithful are urged to keep a solemn and prayerful disposition through to [[Easter]] Sunday.\n\nAt [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] on [[Palm Sunday]], Catholics carry \"palasp\u00e1s\" or palm leaves to be blessed by the priest.  Many Filipinos bring home the palm leaves after the Mass and place these above their front doors or their windows, believing that doing so can ward off evil spirits. Holy Monday marks the beginning of the ''Pabasa'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], \"reading\"), the marathon chanting of the [[Pasyon|Pasy\u00f3n]], a [[poem]] narrating Jesus' life and death. The chanting, which continues day and night without interruption, lasts as long as two straight days.\n\nOne of the most important Holy Week traditions in the Philippines is the ''[[Seven Churches Visitation|Visita Iglesia]]'' (Spanish for \"church visit\").<ref name=PhilStar2015>{{cite news|last1=Vila|first1=Alixandra Caole|title=IN PHOTOS: A look at churches where Pinoys spend Visita Iglesia|url=http://www.philstar.com/travel-and-tourism/2015/04/02/1440184/photos-look-churches-where-pinoys-spend-visita-iglesia|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=philstar.com|newspaper=The Philippine Star|date=2 April 2015}}</ref> On Maundy Thursday, the faithful visit seven churches to pray the [[Stations of the Cross]], and in the evenings, pray in front of each church's Altar of Repose.<ref name=GMA2015>{{cite news|last1=Bartolome|first1=Jessica|title=Doing the Visita Iglesia in Metro Manila|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/463006/lifestyle/artandculture/map-doing-the-visita-iglesia-in-metro-manila|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=GMA News|date=1 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe last Mass before [[Easter]] is also celebrated on Maundy Thursday, usually including a reenactment of the [[Washing of the Feet]] of the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]]. This Mass is followed by the procession of the [[Blessed Sacrament]] to be transferred to the [[Altar of Repose]]. [[Good Friday]] in the Philippines is commemorated with street processions, the [[Way of the Cross]], the commemoration of Jesus' [[Seven last words]] (Siete Palabras) and a Passion play called the [[Passion play|Sinakulo]].\n\nEaster Day is marked with joyous celebration, the first being the dawn ''[[Salubong]]'' rite, wherein statues of Jesus and Mary are brought in procession together to meet, imagining the first reunion of Jesus and his mother Mary after Jesus' [[Resurrection]]. This is followed by the joyous Easter Mass. Most Catholic communities across the Philippines practice this, though it is more popularly celebrated in the provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/254165/lifestyle/artandculture/easter-salubong-rooted-in-culture-family-ties|title=Easter Salubong: Rooted in culture, family ties|website=GMA News Online|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref> The rite, originally called the ''encuentro'', was introduced by Spanish priests during the colonial era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/382513/faithful-rejoice-at-salubong|title=Faithful rejoice at 'salubong'|last=Tubeza|first=Philip C.|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Spain====\n{{Main|Holy Week in Spain}}\n[[File:Carroza de la visi\u00f3n de San Juan, conocida como \"la bola\", Paso Blanco, Semana Santa Lorca.jpg|thumb|Holy week in [[Lorca, Spain]]]]\n\n[[Cartagena (Spain)|Cartagena]], [[C\u00e1diz]], [[C\u00f3rdoba,_Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Murcia]], [[M\u00e1laga]], [[Seville]], [[Valladolid]], [[Palencia]], [[Jerez de la Frontera]], [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], [[Le\u00f3n, Spain|Le\u00f3n]] or [[Ferrol, Galicia|Ferrol]] hold elaborate processions for Holy Week. A tradition dating from [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] that has spread to other cities in [[Andalusia]], the ''\"Semana Santa en Sevilla\"'' is notable for featuring the procession of '''\"pasos\"''', lifelike wood or plaster sculptures of individual scenes of the events that happened between Jesus's arrest and his burial, or images of the Virgin Mary showing grief for the torture and killing of her son. Holy week processions in Seville include marching bands that escort the pasos.<ref>Thomas M Landy, [https://www.catholicsandcultures.org/spain-marches-and-saetas-accompany-holy-week-processions \"In Seville Marches And Saetas Accompany Holy Week Processions\"], ''Catholics & Cultures'' updated 27 June 2018</ref>\n\nIn M\u00e1laga, the lifelike wooden or plaster sculptures are called \"tronos\" and they are carried through the streets by \"costaleros\" ( Translated literally as \"sack men\", because of the ''costal'', a sack-like cloth that they wear over their neck, to soften the burden). These pasos and tronos are physically carried on their necks or \"braceros\" (this name is popular in Leon). The paso can weigh up to five metric tonnes. In front of them walk the penitentes, dressed in long purple robes, often with pointed hats, followed by women in black carrying candles for up to 11 hours. The pasos are set up and maintained by ''hermandades'' and ''cofrad\u00edas'', religious brotherhoods that are common to a specific area of the city, whose precede the paso dressed in Roman military costumes or penitential robes.\n\nThose members who wish to do so wear these penitential robes with conical hats, or ''[[capirotes]]'', used to conceal the face of the wearer. These \"Nazarenos\" or \"Papones\" (this word is typical from Leon) carry processional candles, may walk the city streets barefoot, and may carry shackles and chains in their feet as penance. A brass band, marching band, a drum and bugle band, or in the cases of [[Cartagena (Spain)|Cartagena]] and M\u00e1laga a military band (such as that of the [[Spanish Legion]] or other military units) may accompany the group, playing funeral marches, hymns or \"marchas\" written for the occasion.\n\n===Music===\n{{listen\n | filename    = Tomas Luis de Victoria O vos omnes (The Tudor Consort).ogg\n | title       = Fifth responsory for Holy Saturday\n | description = [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]'s ''[[O vos omnes]]'' performed live by [[The Tudor Consort]] (2003)\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\n\nMusic for the Holy Week includes [[Lamentations of Jeremiah the Prophet]], [[Responsories for Holy Week]], [[Passion oratorio]]s and [[Easter oratorio]]s.\n\n[[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]]'s ''Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae'' (1585) contains settings of 37 texts for the [[Catholic liturgy]] of the Holy Week. [[Carlo Gesualdo]]'s ''[[Responsoria et alia ad Officium Hebdomadae Sanctae spectantia]]'' (1611) contains settings of all 27 [[Tenebrae]] responsories (for [[matins]] of Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday), and of a few other text for use in [[lauds]] of the Holy Week. ''[[Le\u00e7ons de t\u00e9n\u00e8bres]]'' as composed by various French baroque composers were usually intended for performance during the evening of [[Holy Wednesday]], Maundy Thursday and Good Friday.\n\n==Holy Week in Eastern Christianity==\n\n===Eastern Orthodoxy===\nIn the [[Orthodox Church]], the forty days of [[Great Lent]] end on the Friday before Palm Sunday. The two days that follow, [[Lazarus Saturday]] and [[Palm Sunday]], form a transition to Holy Week, neither in Lent nor in Holy Week themselves, but in combination with Holy Week containing the continuing observances in preparation for [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter), during which the faithful continue to fast.\n\nLazarus Saturday commemorates Jesus' [[Raising of Lazarus|raising]] of [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] from the dead, just before he went to Jerusalem himself. The main themes anticipate the [[Resurrection of Jesus]], showing him as master over death. On this day wine and oil are allowed (and, in the Russian tradition, [[caviar]]), lightening the fast by one degree. Palm Sunday is considered one of the [[Great Feasts]] of the Lord, and is celebrated with fish, wine and oil, the lightest degree of fasting, in observance of the festival. Because it is a Great Feast of the Lord, the normal resurrectional elements of the Sunday [[Canonical hours|liturgies]] are omitted. However, some of these resurrectional elements are found in the Lazarus Saturday liturgy.\n\nHoly Week is referred to as \"Great and Holy Week\", or \"Passion Week\".<ref>Triodion (standard Orthodox service book)</ref> Since the Orthodox liturgical day starts at sunset (as it has from antiquity), Holy Monday liturgies begin Sunday evening, at the normal timing for Monday Vespers (Vespers is the first liturgy of the day). However, during Holy Week, in most parishes, many liturgy times are advanced from six to twelve hours in time and celebrated in anticipation, which permits more of the faithful to attend the most prominent liturgies. Thus, it is the [[Matins#Eastern Christianity|matins]] liturgy of Great Monday that is on \"Palm Sunday\" evening in parish churches and often [[vespers]] is in the morning.\n\n[[Fasting]] during Great and Holy Week is very strict, as in Lent at a minimum: dairy products and meat products are strictly forbidden, and on most days, no alcoholic beverages are permitted and no oil is used in cooking.  Holy Friday and Holy Saturday especially may exceed Lenten norms. Those who can, including monastics, observe them as days of abstention, meaning that nothing is eaten on those days. However, fasting is always adjusted to the needs of the individual, and those who are very young, ill or elderly are not expected to fast as strictly. Those who are able may receive the blessing of their [[spiritual father]] to observe an even stricter fast, whereby they eat only two meals that week: one on Wednesday night and one after [[Divine Liturgy]] on Thursday.\n\n====Great and Holy Monday through Wednesday====\n{{Main|Holy Monday|Holy Tuesday|Holy Wednesday}}\n[[File:5208-20080122-1255UTC--jerusalem-calvary.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of Christ the Bridegroom, sitting above the star at [[Golgotha]] in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n\nA new liturgical day beginning at sunset, the first liturgy of each day is [[vespers]] at which [[sticheron|stichera]] are chanted elaborating the theme of the new day.\n\nThese days' Orthros liturgies (which in parishes is performed the previous night) are often referred to as the \"Bridegroom Prayer\", because of their theme of Christ as the Bridegroom of the Church, a theme expressed in the [[troparion]] that is solemnly chanted during them. On these days, an [[icon]] of the \"Bridegroom\" is placed on an [[analogion]] in the center of the [[temple]], portraying Jesus wearing the purple [[robe]] of mockery and crowned with a [[crown of thorns]] (see [[Instruments of the Passion]]).\n\nThe same theme is repeated in the [[exapostilarion]], a hymn which occurs near the end of the liturgy. These liturgies follow much the same pattern as liturgies on weekdays of [[Great Lent]]. The liturgies are so laid out that the entire [[Psalter]] (with the exception of [[Kathisma]] XVII) is chanted on the first three days of Holy Week. The [[canon (hymnography)|canon]] that is chanted on these days is a \"Triode\", i.e., composed of three [[ode]]s instead of the usual nine, as is in other weekday liturgies in the [[Triodion]].\n\nTowards the end of the Tuesday evening Bridegroom liturgy (Orthros for Great and Holy Wednesday), the ''[[Kassia|Hymn of Kassiani]]'' is sung. The [[hymn]], (written in the 9th century by [[Kassia]]) tells of the woman who washed Christ's feet in the house of [[Simon the Pharisee]] ({{bibleverse||Luke|7:36-50|KJV}}). Much of the hymn is written from the perspective of the sinful woman:\n\n<blockquote>O Lord, the woman who had fallen into many sins, sensing Your Divinity, takes upon herself the duty of a myrrh-bearer. With lamentations she brings you myrrh in anticipation of your entombment. \"Woe to me!\" she cries, \"for me night has become a frenzy of licentiousness, a dark and moonless love of sin. Receive the fountain of my tears, O You who gathers into clouds the waters of the sea. Incline unto me,  unto the sighings of my heart, O You who bowed the heavens by your ineffable condescension. I will wash your immaculate feet with kisses and dry them again with the tresses of my hair; those very feet at whose sound Eve hid herself from in fear when she heard You walking in Paradise in the twilight of the day. As for the multitude of my sins and the depths of Your judgements, who can search them out, O Savior of souls, my Savior? Do not disdain me Your handmaiden, O You who are boundless in mercy.\"</blockquote>\n\nOn vespers at the end of Monday through Wednesday is a reading from the Gospel which sets forth the new day's theme and then the [[Divine Liturgy of the Presanctified Gifts]] may be celebrated.\n\nThe Byzantine musical composition expresses the poetry so strongly that it leaves many people in a state of prayerful tears. The Hymn can last upwards of 25 minutes and is liturgically and musically a highpoint of the entire year.\n\n====Great and Holy Thursday====\n{{Main|Holy Thursday}}\n[[File:Omovenie nog.jpg|thumb|An Orthodox [[icon]] of Christ washing the feet of the Apostles (16th century, [[Pskov]] school of [[iconography]])]]\n\nIn many churches, especially Greek Orthodox, a liturgy of [[Anointing]] ([[Holy Unction]]) is held on Wednesday evening, following the Presanctified Liturgy. This is in commemoration of the [[anointing of Jesus]], and a preparation of the faithful to enter with Christ into his death and Resurrection. Those who wish to receive [[Holy Communion]] on Great and Holy Thursday, are encouraged to receive the [[Holy Mystery]] of Unction.\n\nOrthros of Great and Holy Thursday does not follow the format of Great Lent (with the singular exception of chanting [[Alleluia]] in place of [[God is the Lord]]), but is celebrated as outside Lent, having a complete canon. Also, beginning at this liturgy there will be no more reading of the psalter for the rest of Holy Week, with the exception of [[kathisma]] XVII at Orthros of Great and Holy Saturday.\n\nDivine Liturgy of the [[Last Supper]] is held on the morning of Great and Holy Thursday, combining Vespers with the [[Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great]]. There is a custom among some churches to place a simple white linen cloth over the [[Holy Table]] (altar) for this Liturgy, reminiscent of the Last Supper. In cathedrals and [[monastery|monasteries]] it is customary for the [[bishop]] or [[hegumen]] (abbot) to celebrate the [[Washing of Feet]]. When it is necessary for an [[autocephalous]] church to consecrate more [[chrysm]] the [[primate (bishop)|primate]] of that church will consecrate it at this Liturgy.\n\nGreat and Holy Thursday is the only day during Holy Week when those observing the strict tradition will eat a cooked meal, though they will not do so until after the [[dismissal (liturgy)|dismissal]] of the Liturgy. At this meal wine and oil are permitted, but the faithful still abstain from meat and dairy products.\n\n====Great and Holy Friday====\n{{Main|Good Friday}}\nMatins of Great and Holy Friday is celebrated on the evening of Holy Thursday. During this liturgy, twelve [[Matins Gospel]]s are chanted, from which this liturgy derives its name of \"Matins of the Twelve Gospels\".  These Gospel lessons recount in chronological order the events from the Last Supper though the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Burial of Jesus|burial]] of Jesus. At one point, when we reach the first Gospel which speaks of the Crucifixion, there is a custom for the priest to bring out a large [[crucifix|cross]] with an [[icon]] the crucified Christ attached to it, and places it in the center of the [[nave]] for all the faithful to venerate. This cross will remain in the center of the church until the bringing out of the [[epitaphios (liturgical)|epitaphios]] the next evening.\n\nOn Great and Holy Friday morning the [[Royal Hours]] are served. These are a solemn celebration of the [[Little Hours]] with added hymns and readings.\n\n[[File:Hautausikoni.jpg|thumb|250px|The Epitaphios (Plashchanitza) placed in the [[nave]] of the church for the faithful to venerate. The [[Gospel Book]] rests in the center.]]\n\nVespers of Great and Holy Friday (Vespers of the [[Deposition from the Cross]]) is held in the morning or early afternoon of Great and Holy Friday. The figure of Christ is taken down from the Cross, and a richly embroidered cloth icon called the ''[[Epitaphios (liturgy)|Epitaphios]]'' ([[Church Slavonic]]: ''Plashchanitza'') depicting Christ prepared for burial is laid in a \"[[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]]\" decorated with flowers. At the end of the liturgy all come forward to venerate the Epitaphios.\n\n[[Compline]] of Great and Holy Friday contains a Canon of Lamentations of the [[Theotokos]] ([[Mother of God]]).\n\n====Great and Holy Saturday====\n{{Main|Holy Saturday}}\n[[File:Epitaphios Procession Beginning at Great Saturday Mattins.jpg|thumb|250px|Beginning of the epitaphios procession at Great Saturday Mattins]]\n\nMatins of Great and Holy Saturday is, in parish practice, held on Friday evening. The liturgy is known as the \"Orthros of [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Lamentations at the Tomb]]\", because the majority of the liturgy is composed of the clergy and faithful gathered around the tomb, chanting the \"Lamentations\" interspersed between the verses of Kathisma XVII ([[Psalm 119|Psalm 118]]). At a certain point the priest sprinkles the tomb with rose petals and [[rose water]]. Near the end of the liturgy, the Epitaphios is carried in a candlelit procession around the outside of the church as the faithful sing the [[Trisagion]].\n\n[[Vespers]] joined to the [[Divine Liturgy]] is served on Great and Holy Saturday, prescribed by the Liturgical books to be served in the afternoon but often served in the morning.  This is the ''Proti Anastasi'' (First Resurrection) liturgy, commemorating the [[Harrowing of Hell]]. Just before the reading of the Gospel, the [[antependia|hangings]] and [[vestments]] and changed from dark lenten colors to white, and the entire mood of the liturgy changes from mourning to joy. However, the faithful do not yet greet one another with the [[Paschal kiss]], since the Resurrection has not yet been announced to the living.\n\nIf there are [[catechumens]] who are prepared for [[baptism]] they are baptized and [[chrismation|chrismated]] during the Old Testament readings.\n\n[[File:Receiving the Holy Light at Easter.jpg|thumb|250px|People receiving the Holy Light at Easter from Father Diogenis at St George Greek Orthodox Church [[Adelaide]]]]\n\nOn Saturday night, the [[Paschal Vigil]] begins around 11:00&nbsp;pm with the chanting of the [[Midnight Office]]. Afterwards, all of the lighting in the church is extinguished and all remain in silence and darkness until the stroke of midnight. Then, the priest lights a single candle from the [[eternal flame]] on the altar (which is never extinguished). The light is spread from person to person until everyone holds a lighted candle.\n\nA procession then circles around the outside of the church, recreating the journey of the [[Myrrh Bearers]] as they journeyed to the [[Tomb of Jesus]] on the first Easter morning. The procession stops in front of the closed doors of the church. The opening of these doors symbolized the \"rolling away of the stone\" from the tomb by the angel, and all enter the church joyfully singing the [[Troparion]] of [[Easter|Pascha]]. Paschal Orthros begins with an [[Ektenia]] (litany) and the chanting of the Paschal [[Canon (hymnography)|Canon]].\n\nOne of the highpoints is the sharing of the [[paschal kiss]] and the reading of the ''[[Paschal Homily|Hieratikon]]'' ([[Catechism|Catechetical]] [[Homily]] of [[John Chrysostom]]) by the priest. The Divine Liturgy follows, and every Orthodox Christian is encouraged to [[Confession (religion)|confess]] and receive [[Holy Communion]] on this holiest day of the year. A [[breakfast]] usually follows, sometimes lasting till dawn. Slavs bring [[Easter basket]]s filled with eggs, meat, butter, and cheese\u2014foods from which the faithful have abstained during [[Great Lent]]\u2014to be blessed by the priest which are then taken back home to be shared by family and friends with joy.\n\nOn the afternoon of Easter Day, a joyful liturgy called \"[[Agape feast|Agape]] Vespers\" is celebrated. During this liturgy, the [[Prokeimenon|Great Prokeimenon]] is chanted and a lesson from the Gospel ({{bibleverse||John|20:19-25|KJV}}) is read in as many different languages as possible, accompanied by the joyful ringing of bells.\n\n===Coptic Orthodox Church===\nThe Coptic Orthodox Christians fast the Lent for 55 days including the Holy Week which they call Holy Paschal Week.<ref>http://www.zeitun-eg.org/paschag2.pdf</ref>\n\nThe Friday before Palm Sunday is called \"The Concluding Friday of Great Lent\". On this day a special liturgy called \"The Unction of the Sick\" is conducted. It consists of seven prayers and at the conclusion of the prayers, the priest anoints each member of the congregation with the holy oil.\n\nThe following day \u2013 the last Saturday before Holy Week \u2013 is called \"Lazarus' Saturday\". On this day the Coptic Church commemorates [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]], the brother of [[Martha]] and [[Mary of Bethany]]. This day is related to the events of Holy Week in that John 12 tells of a visit of Jesus to Lazarus immediately before recounting the events of Palm Sunday.\n\nSince the liturgical day starts from the evening before a calendar day, the prayers of Palm Sunday begin on the evening of Lazarus' Saturday.\n\nThroughout Holy Week, a paschal liturgy is conducted each evening, starting on Sunday night (the eve of Monday), and every morning, up until Easter. These paschal liturgies take place in the middle of the church, not on the altar, because Jesus suffered and was crucified on Golgotha, outside of Jerusalem. The altar is bared of all its coverings and relics.\n\nEach day liturgy is divided into 5 \"hours\"; The First Hour, The Third Hour, The Sixth Hour, The Ninth Hour, and The Eleventh Hour.\nLikewise, each night liturgy is also divided into the same five hours. However, Good Friday has an extra hour added to it, that of The Twelfth Hour.\nDuring each hour, one prophecy is read at the beginning, a hymn is chanted twelve times, a psalm is sung in a sad tune, one passage from a gospel is read, and an exposition concludes the hour.\nDuring the eve of Friday, four gospel passages are read, and more prophecies are read as well.\nFrom Tuesday night onward, the people do not greet each other nor the priests, and do not even kiss the icons of saints in the church, because it was with a kiss that Judas betrayed Jesus.\n\nOn Thursday of Holy Week, also called Covenant Thursday, a liturgy is prayed and communion is given to symbolize the [[Last Supper]] of Jesus. Also, before the liturgy the priests wash the feet of the congregation in imitation of Jesus washing his disciples' feet.\n\nLate Friday night until early Saturday morning is called Apocalypse Night. During this night, another liturgy is prayed and the entire [[Book of the Apocalypse]] is read, to symbolize the [[Second Coming]].\n\nThe series concludes with the Easter liturgy on Saturday night, followed by a gathering in the church where the participants can celebrate the joy of the resurrection, eating together and ending their long fast, and at which they are permitted once again to partake of meat, fish, and dairy products.\n\n===Eastern Catholic Churches===\nEastern Catholic Churches' Holy Week observances and customs are generally the same as in the rites of the corresponding Eastern Orthodox or Oriental Orthodox Church or Assyrian Church of the East.\n\n==Related observances==\n===Friday of Sorrows===\n{{Main|Friday of Sorrows}}\nThe religious processions that are part of the Holy Week celebrations in many countries begin two days before Holy Week on what in those countries is called Friday of Sorrows.\n\nOn the Friday before Holy Week, the [[Roman Rite]] celebrated universally from 1727 to 1969 a liturgical feast of the [[Seven Sorrows of Mary]]. Celebration of this feast began in Germany but spread to many other countries even before [[Pope Benedict XIII]] made it a universal feast, assigning it to the Friday before Palm Sunday. Another feast with the same name was and still is celebrated in September.<ref>{{Catholic Encyclopedia|no-icon=1|prescript=|first=Frederick|last=Holweck|wstitle=Feasts of the Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary}}</ref> With his [[Code of Rubrics]] of 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]] reduced the feast on the Friday of what was then called Passion Week (the week before Holy Week) to the level of a [[Commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]], and in 1969 the celebration was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]] as a duplicate of the September feast.<ref>''Calendarium Romanum'' (Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1969). p.119</ref> [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 2002 edition of the [[Roman Missal]] provides an alternative [[collect]] for this Friday:<ref>Roman Missal, Friday of the Fifth Week of Lent</ref>\n<blockquote><poem>\nO God, who in this season\ngive your Church the grace\nto imitate devoutly the Blessed Virgin Mary\nin contemplating the Passion of Christ,\ngrant, we pray, through her intercession,\nthat we may cling more firmly each day\nto your Only Begotten Son\nand come at last to the fullness of his grace.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nThis provision of an alternative collect was the equivalent of granting the Lenten celebration of Our Lady of Sorrow the rank of [[memorial (liturgy)|memorial]], since during Lent a memorial, even if otherwise obligatory, is represented in the liturgy of the day at most by optional use of its collect.<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccdds/documents/rc_con_ccdds_doc_20030317_ordinamento-messale_en.html General Instruction of the Roman Missal, 355] and [https://www.liturgyoffice.org.uk/Calendar/Info/GNLY.pdf Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the General Roman Calendar, 14]</ref> The liturgical calendar of [[Malta]] gives the celebration the rank of feast, making its observance obligatory. Observance of the Tridentine Mass calendar as it stood in 1962 is still permitted in the circumstances indicated in the 2007 document ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'', giving Our Lady of Sorrows a [[commemoration (liturgy)|commemoration]] within the liturgy of the Friday.\n\nIn many [[Latin American]] countries, such as [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Peru]], as well as in [[Spain]] and the Philippines, this Friday feast of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is called ''Viernes de Dolores'' ([[Friday of Sorrows]]). It is sometimes also referred to as \"Council Friday\", because of the choice of John 11:47\u201354 as the Gospel passage read in the [[Tridentine Mass]] on that day (which is now read in slightly expanded form on Saturday of the fifth week of Lent), which recounts the meeting of the [[Sanhedrin]] to discuss what to do with Jesus. Its date is exactly a week before [[Good Friday]].\n\nThe somber and often nocturnal commemoration with public processions directs thoughts to the desolate emotional state of the Virgin Mary on Black Saturday as prophesied by the Rabbi Simeon on the \"seven sorrows\" that as an allegorical sword pierced her heart.

In the 10 seasons from 1948 to 1957, the side managed four \"wooden spoons\" and two second last finishes, with seventh place out of 10 clubs in 1954 .\n\nThe next stint in the top flight was between 1962 and 1968, and then reserve grade only in 1969-70.  Then there was involvement in the Sydney District Football Association (the word \"District\" was later dropped from the title) between 1971 and 1987. In the competition's inaugural season, the side contested an \"all student\" grand final against the [[University of New South Wales]], but despite managing the same number of scoring shots as the opposition, they went under by 25 points. Another grand final appearance against the same adversaries in 1977 brought a similar result.\n\nSydney University's first SFA premiership arrived in 1981 after a 10.14 (74) to 9.12 (68) grand final defeat of St Ives, but the following year brought disappointment with a 42-point defeat at the hands of the same opponents.\n\nAfter consecutive flags in 1986 (a 16-point defeat of Manly-Warringah) and 1987 (by 62 points over Bankstown Sports) the side was ready for a 3rd stint at the SFL. After a wooden spoon in 1988, the students began to make steady progress.\n\nBy 1992, under the expert guidance of former [[Sydney Swans]] stalwart [[Rod Carter]], the Students were ready to take a serious tilt at the flag, and after finishing as minor premiers they qualified to meet reigning premiers [[North Shore Bombers|North Shore]] in the premiership decider and won by 65 points. Final scores were Sydney University 18.16 (124) to North Shore 8.11 (59. After dropping to 5th in 1993, the side moved to 8th position (out of 10) in 1994, before returning to the SFA. After taking a couple of season to find their feet, the Students contested every grand final bar one between 1997 and 2001, although they were only ultimately able to secure 2 premierships.\n\nIn 2007, the Students were re-admitted to the top flight of the Sydney AFL after an absence of 12 years. Under coach Daniel Archer, the club finished with a respectable five wins to finish in eighth spot on the ladder. The club was to take bigger strides in 2008, just missing out on a finals berth on the last day of the season after a loss to North Shore.\n\nThe 2009 season saw a change of coach \u2013 Roger Moten who had coached local rival UTS to premiership success was installed, as was a new captain in Mark Egan. Again, the Students fell agonisingly short of a finals berth after a string of close losses throughout the season, however there was success at an individual level for two players with Tom Young winning the Sydney AFL Rising Star award and Brydon Coles taking home the coveted Phelan Medal for the Best & Fairest player in the Sydney AFL Premier Division.\n\nIn 2010 the Students showed they belonged amongst the elite clubs in the Sydney AFL, taking out the minor premiership following a 14-game winning streak to end the home and away rounds. The club qualified for its maiden Sydney AFL Premier Division Grand Final since re-entry into the top flight with a hard-fought win against Western Suburbs. The club was experiencing its best season of the modern era, with its Division 1 and Colts sides also qualifying for the Grand Final, along with multiple individual award winners at the annual Sydney AFL awards night. Alex Lee took out the Phelan Medal, finishing 2nd in the vote tally but winning on default due to Damien Bowles from East Coast Eagles who accumulated more votes but was ruled ineligible due to a suspension through the year. This marked the first time in history an SUANFC player claimed the award two years in a row, whilst Tim Air collected the Snow Medal (awarded to Best and Fairest in Division 1) and Monty Krochmal was awarded the Kealy Medal (for U18 Premier Division B&F). Roger Moten was named Sydney AFL Coach of the Year for his achievements. The Students were defeated on Grand Final day in both Premier Division and Division 1 by East Coast and UTS respectively, however the Colts were able to hoist the trophy in the Under 18s with a thrilling victory over their East Coast counterparts.\n\n2011 saw Uni consolidate on their performances of the previous year, with the Senior team falling one game short of qualifying for a second consecutive Grand Final. However, the season was a success across all grades with all six teams at the club qualifying for finals action. The best performed side were the Division 3 'Reds' who were valiant in a Grand Final defeat at the hands of UNSW. Another highlight for the year was former Uni star Tom Young being selected to make his debut for Collingwood, thereby becoming the first Sydney University player to reach the AFL. In August, SUANFC accepted an invitation to the NEAFL which will see the proud club being pitted against opponents from NSW, Queensland, ACT and the Northern Territory from 2012 onward.\n\n2012 was a year of mixed results for the Students, with the elevation of the Seniors to the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL). The elevation of the Seniors to the NEAFL also saw the club's Reserves side elevated to the Sydney AFL Premier Division, however the 3rd to 5th grade sides remained in their existing divisions (3rd Grade \u2013 Div 2, 4th Grade \u2013 Div 3, 5th Grade \u2013 Div 5). While the Seniors and Reserves struggled to post many wins for the year, the club did taste success in the lower grades with all three lower grade sides playing finals. The most successful of these sides was the Division 5 'Golds' who triumphed over arch-rivals UTS by 5 points in a thrilling Grand Final at Blacktown International Sportspark to deliver the club its only premiership for 2012.\n\n2013 was a year that saw two divisional changes, including the 5th grade 'Golds' being elevated to Division 4 and the birth of a new division 5 side (6th Grade 'Platinums'). The 3rd Grade \u2013 Div 2 'blues' enjoyed winning a premiership over Manly. While the 5th Grade \u2013 Div 4 'Golds' were unlucky to lose the final to Pennant Hills. The 4th Grade \u2013 Div 3 'Reds', Under 18's and first year 6th Grade \u2013 Div 5 'Platinums' all managed to make finals.\n\n==League affiliations==\nAffiliated: NSWANFL 1948\u201357 & 1962\u201368; SFA 1971\u201387; SFL 1988\u201394; SFA 1995\u20132006; SFL 2007\u2013present\n\nPremierships: SFL \u2013 1992 (1 total); SFA \u2013 1981, 1986\u201387, 1997, 2003, 2005 (6 total)\n\nPhelan Medallists: Geoff Davidson 1953; Michael Davis 1990; Brydon Coles 2009; Alex Lee 2010 (4 total)\n\nSnow Medallists: Peter Sadler 1971; Peter Moggach 1979; Tim Driscoll 1987; Tim Air 2010 (4 total)\n\nNEAFL MVP: Tom Young 2015 (1 total)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sydney AFL]]\n*[[Melbourne University Football Club]]\n*[[Adelaide University Football Club]]\n*[[University of Queensland Australian Football Club]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*Sydney University Students AFC [http://www.suanfc.com/ Official Site]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{University of Sydney}}\n{{NEAFL}}\n{{SydneyAFLclubs}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1863]]\n[[Category:University Australian rules football clubs]]\n[[Category:Sport at the University of Sydney|Aus]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football clubs in Sydney]]\n[[Category:1863 establishments in Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{About||the association football club|Sydney Uni SFC|the rugby union club|Sydney University Football Club}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2009}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Infobox Australian football club \n| clubname = Sydney University\n| image = Sydney univ fc logo.png\n| image_size = 130px\n| color1 = #000099\n| color2 = #ffcc00\n| color3 = solid #ffcc00\n| fullname = Sydney University Australian National Football Club\n| emblem = The Students\n| strip = Gold and Blue\n| founded = {{Start date and age|1887}} (first official game)\n| president = Sam Power\n| coach = Tom Morrison (2017)\n| co-captains = Tom Young, Austin Lucy, Lewis Stevenson (2016)\n| ground = No 1 Oval, [[Sydney University]], Parramatta Road, [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]]\n| song =\n| sport = [[Australian rules football]]\n| league = [[North East Australian Football League|NEAFL]]\n| season = 2016\n| position = Third\n| pattern_b1      = _goldhoops\n| pattern_sh1     = \n| pattern_so1     = _hoops_gold\n| body1           = 000099\n| shorts1         = 000099\n| socks1          = 000099\n  | url       = [http://www.suanfc.com/ suanfc.com]\n  | jumper     =  \n}}\n\n'''Sydney University Australian National Football Club''' (SUANFC) was founded in 1865 and is the oldest [[Australian rules football]] club in [[New South Wales]].

In August, SUANFC accepted an invitation to the NEAFL which will see the proud club being pitted against opponents from NSW, Queensland, ACT and the Northern Territory from 2012 onward.\n\n2012 was a year of mixed results for the Students, with the elevation of the Seniors to the North East Australian Football League (NEAFL). The elevation of the Seniors to the NEAFL also saw the club's Reserves side elevated to the Sydney AFL Premier Division, however the 3rd to 5th grade sides remained in their existing divisions (3rd Grade \u2013 Div 2, 4th Grade \u2013 Div 3, 5th Grade \u2013 Div 5). While the Seniors and Reserves struggled to post many wins for the year, the club did taste success in the lower grades with all three lower grade sides playing finals. The most successful of these sides was the Division 5 'Golds' who triumphed over arch-rivals UTS by 5 points in a thrilling Grand Final at Blacktown International Sportspark to deliver the club it's only premiership for 2012.\n\n2013 was a year that saw two divisional changes, including the 5th grade 'Golds' being elevated to Division 4 and the birth of a new division 5 side (6th Grade 'Platinums'). The 3rd Grade \u2013 Div 2 'blues' enjoyed winning a premiership over Manly. While the 5th Grade \u2013 Div 4 'Golds' were unlucky to lose the final to Pennant Hills. The 4th Grade \u2013 Div 3 'Reds', Under 18's and first year 6th Grade \u2013 Div 5 'Platinums' all managed to make finals.\n\n==League affiliations==\nAffiliated: NSWANFL 1948\u201357 & 1962\u201368; SFA 1971\u201387; SFL 1988\u201394; SFA 1995\u20132006; SFL 2007\u2013present\n\nPremierships: SFL \u2013 1992 (1 total); SFA \u2013 1981, 1986\u201387, 1997, 2003, 2005 (6 total)\n\nPhelan Medallists: Geoff Davidson 1953; Michael Davis 1990; Brydon Coles 2009; Alex Lee 2010 (4 total)\n\nSnow Medallists: Peter Sadler 1971; Peter Moggach 1979; Tim Driscoll 1987; Tim Air 2010 (4 total)\n\nNEAFL MVP: Tom Young 2015 (1 total)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Sydney AFL]]\n*[[Melbourne University Football Club]]\n*[[Adelaide University Football Club]]\n*[[University of Queensland Australian Football Club]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*Sydney University Students AFC [http://www.suanfc.com/ Official Site]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{University of Sydney}}\n{{NEAFL}}\n{{SydneyAFLclubs}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Sports clubs established in 1863]]\n[[Category:University Australian rules football clubs]]\n[[Category:Sport at the University of Sydney|Aus]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football clubs in Sydney]]\n[[Category:1863 establishments in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_University_Australian_National_Football_Club"}

The system later spread to medieval Europe by the [[High Middle Ages]].\n\nThe system is based upon ten (originally nine) [[glyph]]s. The symbols (glyphs) used to represent the system are in principle independent of the system itself. The glyphs in actual use are descended from [[Brahmi numerals]] and have split into various typographical variants since the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nThese symbol sets can be divided into three main families: [[Western Arabic numerals]] used in the [[Greater Maghreb]] and in [[Europe]], [[Eastern Arabic numerals]] (also called \"Indic numerals\") used in the [[Middle East]], and the Indian numerals in various scripts used in the [[Indian subcontinent]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe Hindu-Arabic or Indo-Arabic numerals were invented by mathematicians in India.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Felix|last1=Klein|title=Elementary Mathematics from an Advanced Standpoint: Arithmetic, Algebra, Analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vfSutjEIZXkC&pg=PA6|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2009|isbn=978-1605209319|via=Google Books}}</ref> Perso-Arabic mathematicians called them \"Hindu numerals\" (where \"[[Hindu]]\" meant Indian).

In a more developed form, positional notation also uses a [[Decimal separator|decimal marker]] (at first a mark over the ones digit but now more usually a decimal point or a decimal comma which separates the ones place from the tenths place), and also a symbol for \"these digits recur ''[[ad infinitum]]''\". In modern usage, this latter symbol is usually a [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] (a horizontal line placed over the repeating digits). In this more developed form, the numeral system can symbolize any [[rational number]] using only 13 symbols (the ten digits, decimal marker, vinculum, and a prepended [[minus sign]] to indicate a [[negative number]]).\n\nAlthough generally found in text written with the Arabic [[abjad]] (\"alphabet\"), numbers written with these numerals also place the most-significant digit to the left, so they read from left to right. The requisite changes in reading direction are found in text that mixes left-to-right writing systems with right-to-left systems.\n\n== Symbols ==\n\nVarious symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, most of which developed from the [[Brahmi numeral]]s.\n\nThe symbols used to represent the system have split into various typographical variants since the [[Middle Ages]], arranged in three main groups:\n* The widespread Western \"[[Arabic numerals]]\" used with the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and [[Greek alphabet]]s in the table, descended from the \"West Arabic numerals\" which were developed in [[al-Andalus]] and the [[Maghreb]] (there are two [[Typography|typographic]] styles for rendering western Arabic numerals, known as lining figures and [[text figures]]).\n* The \"Arabic\u2013Indic\" or \"[[Eastern Arabic numerals]]\" used with Arabic script, developed primarily in what is now [[Iraq]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} A variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals is used in Persian and Urdu.\n* The [[Indian numerals]] in use with scripts of the [[Brahmic family]] in India and Southeast Asia.

In a more developed form, positional notation also uses a [[Decimal separator|decimal marker]] (at first a mark over the ones digit but now more usually a decimal point or a decimal comma which separates the ones place from the tenths place), and also a symbol for \"these digits recur ''[[ad infinitum]]''\". In modern usage, this latter symbol is usually a [[vinculum (symbol)|vinculum]] (a horizontal line placed over the repeating digits). In this more developed form, the numeral system can symbolize any [[rational number]] using only 13 symbols (the ten digits, decimal marker, vinculum, and a prepended [[minus sign]] to indicate a [[negative number]]).\n\nAlthough generally found in text written with the Arabic [[abjad]] (\"alphabet\"), numbers written with these numerals also place the most-significant digit to the left, so they read from left to right. The requisite changes in reading direction are found in text that mixes left-to-right writing systems with right-to-left systems.\n\n== Symbols ==\n\nVarious symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, most of which developed from the [[Brahmi numeral]]s.\n\nThe symbols used to represent the system have split into various typographical variants since the [[Middle Ages]], arranged in three main groups:\n* The widespread Western \"[[Arabic numerals]]\" used with the [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and [[Greek alphabet]]s in the table, descended from the \"West Arabic numerals\" which were developed in [[al-Andalus]] and the [[Maghreb]] (there are two [[Typography|typographic]] styles for rendering western Arabic numerals, known as lining figures and [[text figures]]).\n* The \"Arabic\u2013Indic\" or \"[[Eastern Arabic numerals]]\" used with Arabic script, developed primarily in what is now [[Iraq]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}} A variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals is used in Persian and Urdu.\n* The [[Indian numerals]] in use with scripts of the [[Brahmic family]] in India and Southeast Asia.

Later he obtained from these places the book ''{{lang|la|De multiplicatione et divisione}}'' (''On multiplication and division''). After becoming [[Pope Sylvester II]] in the year 999, he introduced a new model of [[abacus]], the so-called [[Pope Sylvester II#Abacus and Hindu\u2013Arabic numerals|Abacus of Gerbert]], by adopting tokens representing Hindu\u2013Arab numerals, from one to nine.\n\n{{lang|it|[[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]]}} brought this system to Europe. His book ''{{lang|la|[[Liber Abaci]]}}'' introduced Arabic numerals, the use of zero, and the decimal place system to the Latin world. The numeral system came to be called \"Arabic\" by the Europeans. It was used in European mathematics from the 12th century, and entered common use from the 15th century to replace [[Roman numerals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.halexandria.org/dward093.htm|title=Fibonacci Numbers|website=www.halexandria.org}}</ref><ref>[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-4153/Leonardo-Pisano Leonardo Pisano: \"Contributions to number theory\"].

Offices subsequently opened in The Hague (the Netherlands) and Ch\u00e2tel-Saint-Denis (Switzerland).\n\nThe company spent its early days developing the concept of dynamically positioned (DP) subsea pipelay. Allseas acquired the former bulk carrier \u201cNatalie Bolten\u201d in 1985 and converted it for DP pipelay at the Boele shipyard in Bolnes, the Netherlands. The vessel was christened ''[https://allseas.com/equipment/lorelay/ Lorelay]'' in Rotterdam on 26 April 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/swan-revival-means-1200-jobs-1340756.html|title=Swan revival means 1,200 jobs|website=www.independent.co.uk}}</ref> ''Lorelay'' immediately entered service and successfully executed her first pipelay contract, the 8-inch, 1.8-km Helder A-B pipeline, for Unocal in the Dutch sector of the North Sea.\n\nIn 1987, the company declared its intention to build a vessel capable of lifting entire offshore platforms. The initial idea featured two rigidly connected, self-propelled supertankers, with a large slot at the bows to install platform topsides in one piece.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-96/issue-18/in-this-issue/general-interest/major-deepwater-pipelay-vessel-starts-work-in-north-sea.html|title=Major deepwater pipelay vessel starts work in North Sea|website=www.ogj.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s, the company established itself a major player in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. In 1992, the company acquired the former bulkhead carrier \u201cTrenchwood\u201d for conversion to ''[https://allseas.com/equipment/solitaire/ Solitaire],'' the world's largest pipelay vessel.

It was founded with the aim of spreading and making more known this new sport ([[Association football|football]]) to the Athenian and Greek public in general. Also, the intention of the founders was to create a team for all of Athens and to be connected with the rest of the European football movement, which was already active.<ref name=\"To 1908\">[http://paoabroad.com/index.php/2014-11-30-15-03-04/kitroef/item/714-to-1908 To 1908... ] | website=Paoabroad.com</ref> The first president elected was Alexandros Kalafatis, brother of Giorgos.

Subsequently, the name of the club changed to Panellinios Podosferikos Omilos (\"Panhellenic Football Club\") and its colours to green and white. By 1914, Campbell had returned to England but the club was already at the top of Greek football with players such as [[Michalis Papazoglou]], Michalis Rokkos and [[Loukas Panourgias]].\n\nIn 1918, the team adopted the [[trifolium]] ([[shamrock]]) as its emblem, as proposed by [[Michalis Papazoglou]].<ref name=\"ethnosport\">{{cite news | title=The Golden Age of PAO | url=http://sports.e-go.gr/article.asp?catid=8332&subid=2&pubid=772208 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421150952/http://sports.e-go.gr/article.asp?catid=8332&subid=2&pubid=772208 | url-status=dead | archive-date=21 April 2008 | work=Ethnosport | language=Greek | publisher=Pegasus Publishing S.A. | author=Kyriazis, Christos | date=4 February 2008 | accessdate=28 March 2008 }}</ref> In 1921 and 1922, the [[Athens-Piraeus Football Clubs Association|Athens-Piraeus FCA]] organized the first two post-[[World War I|WWI]] championships, in both of which PPO was declared champion. By that stage, the club had outgrown both the grounds in Patission Street and Amerikis Square, due mainly to its expansion in other sports, and began to look at vacant land in the area of Perivola on [[Alexandras Avenue]] as its potential new ground.<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> After long discussions with the [[Municipality of Athens]], an agreement was finally reached and in 1922 [[Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium|''Leoforos'']] (\"Avenue\" in Greek) was granted to the club.<ref name=\"pao vima\"/>\n\nThe move to a permanent home ground also heralded another\u2014final\u2014name change to '''Panathinaikos Athlitikos Omilos (PAO)''', \"''All-Athenian Athletic Club''\", on 15 March 1924,<ref name=\"pao vima\"/> from now on a [[multi-sport club]].

Messaris, who scored again three goals, became a hero and chant for the fans.\n\n=== Crisis and WWII years ===\nIn 1931, a serious disagreement between leading board member [[Apostolos Nikolaidis (athlete)|Apostolos Nikolaidis]] from one side, and some players (most notably [[Angelos Messaris]]) and club's officials on the other side,<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> regarding the [[professionalization]] in the [[Football in Greece|Greek football]], which lasted two years, damaged the club and led to a counterproductive period. In the meantime, the HFF [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] had commenced in 1932. The last bright moment for the Greens before World War II was winning the Cup for the first time in 1940 against Aris, 3\u20131.\n\nIn 1940, with the break out of the [[Greco-Italian War]], many players of the club joined the [[Hellenic Army]]. [[Mimis Pierrakos]] was killed during the war (later, during the 1950s, his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens). During the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] from 1941 to 1944, many players of the team became members of [[United Panhellenic Organization of Youth]] (PEAN) resistance organization.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xyzcontagion.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/podosfairo-polemos-katoxi-emfylios |title=Football during the War |website=Xyzcontagion.wordpress.com  |language=Greek }}</ref> while [[Michalis Papazoglou]] had a leading role in the resistance group of [[Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz]].\n\nAfter this long crisis period, Panathinaikos had to wait until 1949 to win again a Greek Championship under the guidance of the Austrian coach [[Johann Strnad]]. That same year, Vangelis Panakis and [[Kostas Linoxilakis]] came to the club and quickly became the side's new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the [[1952\u201353 Panhellenic Championship]].\n\nUntil 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight [[Athens Football Clubs Association|Athens Championships]], the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, [[Mimis Domazos]], the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki ([[1959\u201360 Alpha Ethniki]]). Panathinaikos was the champion team.\n\n=== 1960s: The Golden Decade, the Bobek's rejuvenation ===\nDuring the next years, Panathinaikos were again champions in [[1960\u201361 Alpha Ethniki|1961]], [[1961\u201362 Alpha Ethniki|1962]], [[1963\u201364 Alpha Ethniki|1964]], [[1964\u201365 Alpha Ethniki|1965]], [[1968\u201369 Alpha Ethniki|1969]] and [[1969\u201370 Alpha Ethniki|1970]]. Moreover, the team won two more Greek Cups, in [[1966\u201367 Greek Cup|1967]] and [[1968\u201369 Greek Cup|1969]]. Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, [[Takis Loukanidis]] and [[Andreas Papaemmanouil]], and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, [[Antonis Antoniadis]], [[Anthimos Kapsis]], [[Kostas Eleftherakis]] and [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]].\n\n[[Stjepan Bobek]] was the main contributor to this process. In 1963, he became the club's head coach, changing the playing style of the team to a 4\u20133\u20133 and created a new team based on young players (the \"Bobek's rejuvenation\"). Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the Championship of 1964 without a loss, making them one of the two teams that has won the Greek Championship (with its modern system) undefeated.<ref name=\"paohistory2\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229045544/http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archivedate=29 December 2015\n |title=History\n |website=Pao.gr\n |accessdate=23 June 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref> Notable players of the team included Panakis, Domazos, [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]], [[Totis Filakouris]], [[Frangiskos Sourpis]] and [[Aristidis Kamaras]].\n\nWith the establishment of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military regime]], the president of the club, [[Loukas Panourgias]], was forced out of the presidency.

The stadium is located on [[Alexandras Avenue]] and is most commonly referred to as ''Leoforos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"Avenue\"). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the [[Greece national football team|Greek national team]] as home ground for many years (most recently for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos' biggest rivals, [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], on various occasions.\n\nPanathinaikos left ''Leoforos'' in 1984 to play in the newly-built [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]]. In 2000, then-club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, following a \u20ac7 million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with [[UEFA]] requirements, but in 2004, stricter standards were announced and the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed [[Votanikos Arena]], was built. The ''Leoforos'' ground was due for demolition.\n\nOn 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the team's 2007\u201308 domestic league and UEFA Cup home games. Additionally, the club officials decided to install new lawn, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms.\n\nAs of October 2013, and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.\n\nThe current president of the club, [[Giannis Alafouzos]], declared his intention for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the [[Panathinaikos Movement]] made its propositions for a total reconstruction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

That same year, the [[Panathinaikos F.C. Academy|Academy]] of the club was reorganized, becoming one of the best in the country and feeding the first team with notable players, such as [[Giorgos Karagounis]], [[Angelos Basinas]], [[Sotirios Kyrgiakos]] and [[Sotiris Ninis]] among others, key members of the Greek national team. In 2013, was decided the move of the club from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the team. Located in the area of [[Koropi]], [[Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center]] became a new training ground and Academy base of Panathinaikos.\n\n==Financial information==\nUntil 1979, football in Greece was still in amateur level. The team, such as the other departments of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]], depended on the financial support of the club's members, while the president (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the Board members. In 1979, the Greek football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. [[Yiorgos Vardinogiannis|Giorgos Vardinogiannis]] became the new president.<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades.\n\nOn 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%\u2014after 30 years of full ownership\u2014through a \u20ac80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% (as before) and the new shareholders 34%. [[Pavlos Giannakopoulos]], [[Nikos Pateras]], [[Adamantios Polemis]] and [[Andreas Vgenopoulos (businessman)|Andreas Vgenopoulos]] were the main investors, plus other minor shareholders. Nikos Pateras was selected to be the new president.\n\nIn 2011, due to financial problems and management disagreements, the direction decided to reduce the budget and sell many players. In 2012, the owner of [[Skai TV]], [[Giannis Alafouzos]], devised a plan to take Vardinogiannis' shares (54.7%) and make them available to fans around Greece so that everyone could contribute, so that Panathinaikos could overcome the crisis.<ref name=\"alafouzos1\"/> His intention was to create a new, for the Greek athletic standards, [[List of fan-owned sports teams|supporter-owned football club]]. On 2 July 2012, the '''Panathenaic Alliance''' finally opened to the public so that everyone could be a member and contribute a desired amount in return for privileges. A few days later, Giannis Vardinogiannis gave his shares\u201454.7% of Panathinaikos\u2014to the Alliance, while the other shareholders maintained their percentage. The members of the Alliance through elections compose the Board of Directors and elect the club's president. The first president elected was [[Giannis Alafouzos]]. In 2013, was decided the move of the team from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the club. Located in the area of [[Koropi]], [[Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center]] became the new training ground and academy base of Panathinaikos.\n\nFor the [[2014\u201315 Panathinaikos F.C. season|2014\u201315]] season, the membership had risen up to 8,495 members contributing a total of \u20ac2,680,041.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|- style=\"color:black;\"\n!

Messaris, who scored again three goals, became a hero and chant for the fans.\n\n=== Crisis and WWII years ===\nIn 1931, a serious disagreement between leading board member [[Apostolos Nikolaidis (athlete)|Apostolos Nikolaidis]] from one side, and some players (most notably [[Angelos Messaris]]) and club's officials on the other side,<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> regarding the [[professionalization]] in the [[Football in Greece|Greek football]], which lasted two years, damaged the club and led to a counterproductive period. In the meantime, the HFF [[Greek Football Cup|Greek Cup]] had commenced in 1932. The last bright moment for the Greens before World War II was winning the Cup for the first time in 1940 against Aris, 3\u20131.\n\nIn 1940, with the break out of the [[Greco-Italian War]], many players of the club joined the [[Hellenic Army]]. [[Mimis Pierrakos]] was killed during the war (later, during the 1950s, his bones were transferred from Albania back to Athens). During the [[Axis Occupation of Greece]] from 1941 to 1944, many players of the team became members of [[United Panhellenic Organization of Youth]] (PEAN) resistance organization.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xyzcontagion.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/podosfairo-polemos-katoxi-emfylios |title=Football during the War |website=Xyzcontagion.wordpress.com  |language=Greek }}</ref> while [[Michalis Papazoglou]] had a leading role in the resistance group of [[Jerzy Iwanow-Szajnowicz]].\n\nAfter this long crisis period, Panathinaikos had to wait until 1949 to win again a Greek Championship under the guidance of the Austrian coach [[Johann Strnad]]. That same year, Vangelis Panakis and [[Kostas Linoxilakis]] came to the club and quickly became the side's new star players. Panathinaikos was again champion for the [[1952\u201353 Panhellenic Championship]].\n\nUntil 1959, the team had also won seven of the last eight [[Athens Football Clubs Association|Athens Championships]], the regional championships organised in Greece. In 1959, [[Mimis Domazos]], the emblematic captain of the team, made his first appearance with Panathinaikos and the same year took place the first season under the new system of Alpha Ethniki ([[1959\u201360 Alpha Ethniki]]). Panathinaikos was the champion team.\n\n=== 1960s: The Golden Decade, the Bobek's rejuvenation ===\nDuring the next years, Panathinaikos were again champions in [[1960\u201361 Alpha Ethniki|1961]], [[1961\u201362 Alpha Ethniki|1962]], [[1963\u201364 Alpha Ethniki|1964]], [[1964\u201365 Alpha Ethniki|1965]], [[1968\u201369 Alpha Ethniki|1969]] and [[1969\u201370 Alpha Ethniki|1970]]. Moreover, the team won two more Greek Cups, in [[1966\u201367 Greek Cup|1967]] and [[1968\u201369 Greek Cup|1969]]. Also, during these years, a long process of rejuvenation took place in the club. Notable players retired, such as Panakis, Linoxilakis, [[Takis Loukanidis]] and [[Andreas Papaemmanouil]], and the team had to count on young players like Domazos, [[Antonis Antoniadis]], [[Anthimos Kapsis]], [[Kostas Eleftherakis]] and [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]].\n\n[[Stjepan Bobek]] was the main contributor to this process. In 1963, he became the club's head coach, changing the playing style of the team to a 4\u20133\u20133 and created a new team based on young players (the \"Bobek's rejuvenation\"). Under his guidance, Panathinaikos won the Championship of 1964 without a loss, making them one of the two teams that has won the Greek Championship (with its modern system) undefeated.<ref name=\"paohistory2\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229045544/http://www.pao.gr/en/history/\n |archivedate=29 December 2015\n |title=History\n |website=Pao.gr\n |accessdate=23 June 2011\n |url-status=dead\n |df=dmy\n}}</ref> Notable players of the team included Panakis, Domazos, [[Takis Ikonomopoulos]], [[Totis Filakouris]], [[Frangiskos Sourpis]] and [[Aristidis Kamaras]].\n\nWith the establishment of the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|Greek military regime]], the president of the club, [[Loukas Panourgias]], was forced out of the presidency.

The stadium is located on [[Alexandras Avenue]] and is most commonly referred to as ''Leoforos'' ([[Greek language|Greek]] for \"Avenue\"). It is considered one of the most historic stadiums in Greece, as it was used by the [[Greece national football team|Greek national team]] as home ground for many years (most recently for the [[UEFA Euro 2004]] qualifying matches) and even by Panathinaikos' biggest rivals, [[AEK Athens F.C.|AEK Athens]] and [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]], on various occasions.\n\nPanathinaikos left ''Leoforos'' in 1984 to play in the newly-built [[Olympic Stadium (Athens)|Athens Olympic Stadium]]. In 2000, then-club president Angelos Filippidis announced a return to the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium, following a \u20ac7 million renovation. Capacity was reduced from 25,000 to 16,620, new dressing rooms were built and modular stand roofing was added in compliance with [[UEFA]] requirements, but in 2004, stricter standards were announced and the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium would need further expansion were it to remain suitable for UEFA-sanctioned matches. This was precluded by local zoning regulations and the team had to return to the Olympic Stadium once more until a new stadium, the proposed [[Votanikos Arena]], was built. The ''Leoforos'' ground was due for demolition.\n\nOn 27 January 2007, the board of Panathinaikos decided to reuse the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium for the team's 2007\u201308 domestic league and UEFA Cup home games. Additionally, the club officials decided to install new lawn, new seats and upgrade the press conference room and the restrooms.\n\nAs of October 2013, and due to the club's and the country's financial troubles, the construction of the Votanikos Arena has stopped and consequently the plans for the demolition of the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium have been put on hold. After another five-year spell at the Olympic Stadium, the team has returned to its traditional home ground once again.\n\nThe current president of the club, [[Giannis Alafouzos]], declared his intention for another renovation of the stadium and the capacity increase, while the [[Panathinaikos Movement]] made its propositions for a total reconstruction.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

In 2013, was decided the move of the club from the previous training center of Paiania to a new one, owned by the team. Located in the area of [[Koropi]], [[Georgios Kalafatis Sports Center]] became a new training ground and Academy base of Panathinaikos.\n\n==Financial information==\nUntil 1979, football in Greece was still in amateur level. The team, such as the other departments of [[Panathinaikos A.O.]], depended on the financial support of the club's members, while the president (responsible for all athletic departments) was elected by the Board members. In 1979, the Greek football turned professional and the Vardinogiannis family purchased the football department. [[Yiorgos Vardinogiannis|Giorgos Vardinogiannis]] became the new president.<ref name=\"ethnosport\"/> Vardinogiannis family were the owners of the club the next decades.\n\nOn 22 April 2008, and under pressure from the fan base, main shareholder Giannis Vardinogiannis gave a press conference in which he announced the decision of his family to reduce their share in the club to 50%\u2014after 30 years of full ownership\u2014through a \u20ac80 million increase of the company's capital stock. After the negotiations and the share capital increase, the Vardinogiannis family would hold 56% of the club, the amateur Club 10% (as before) and the new shareholders 34%.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin.
