she and her husband, [[Saint Joachim]], are infertile, but God hears their prayers for a child, and so Mary is conceived and born, and, like Samuel, is taken to spend her childhood in the temple.{{sfn|Nixon|2004|p=11-12}} In the earliest texts, probably representing the original version, the conception occurs without [[sexual intercourse]] between Anne and Joachim, but the story does not advance the idea of an immaculate conception.{{sfn|Shoemaker|2016|p=unpaginated}} The Protevangelium does not advance the idea that Mary was conceived without [[original sin]].{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} \n\n===Original sin===\nOriginal sin was defined by [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 AD).{{sfn|Wiley|2002|p=37}} Engaged in a controversy with the monk [[Pelagius]] over the question of whether infants could sin (Pelagius said they could not and therefore would not go to hell if unbaptised), he inserted original sin and the fall from grace into the story of the [[Garden of Eden]] and Paul's [[Letter to the Romans]],{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} it is not part of the story of [[Adam and Eve]]{{sfn|Toews|2013|pp=88}} and the [[Apostle Paul]] regarded sin and death not as a punishment for Adam's sin but as the natural lot of mankind.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=301}} Augustine also identified male semen as the means by which original sin was made heritable, leaving only Jesus Christ, conceived without semen, free of the sin passed down from Adam through the sexual act,{{sfn|Stortz|2001|pp=93\u201494}} a sentiment echoed as late as 1930 by Pope [[Pius XI]] in his ''Casti Conubii'': \"The natural generation of life has become the path of death by which original sin is communicated to the children.\"{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=43}}\n\n===Medieval formulation===\n[[File:Lusenberg-Immaculata-1876.jpg|thumb|220px|''Altar of the Immaculata'' by [[Josef Moroder-Lusenberg|Joseph Lusenberg]], 1876. Saint Antony's Church, [[Urtij\u00ebi]], Italy.]]\nMary's [[sinlessness of Mary|freedom from personal sin]] was affirmed in the 4th century, but Augustine's argument that original sin was transmitted through sex raised the question of whether she could also be free of the sin of Adam.{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=209}} The English ecclesiastic and scholar [[Eadmer]] (c.1060-c.1126) reasoned that it was possible in view of God's omnipotence and appropriate in view of Mary's role as [[Mother of God]]: ''Potuit, decuit, fecit'', \"it was possible, it was fitting, therefore it was done;\"{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=36-37}} [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090-1153) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274), among others, objected that if Mary were free of original sin at her conception then she would have no need of redemption, making Christ superfluous; they were answered answered by [[Duns Scotus]] (1264-1308), who reasoned that her preservation from original sin was a redemption more perfect than that granted through Christ.{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=37-38}} \n\nNevertheless, it was not theological theory that initiated discussion of Mary's freedom from mankind's curse, but the celebration of her [[liturgy]], for the popular feast of her conception brought forth the objection that as sexual intercourse is sinful, to celebrate Mary's conception was to celebrate a sinful event.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} Some held that no sin had occurred, for Anne had conceived Mary not through sex but by kissing her husband Joachim, and that Anne's father and mother had likewise been conceived; but [[St Bridget of Sweden]] (c.1303-1373) told how Mary herself had revealed to her in a vision that although Anne and Joachim conceived their daughter through sexual union, the act was sinless because free of sexual desire.{{sfn|Solberg|2018|p=108-109}} \n\nIn 1431 the [[Council of Basel]] declared Mary's immaculate conception a \"pious opinion\" consistent with faith and Scripture; the [[Council of Trent]], held in several sessions in the early 1500s, made no explicit declaration on the subject but exempted her from the universality of original sin; and by 1571 the Pope's [[Breviary]] (prayerbook) set out an elaborate celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December.{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=4-5,117}}\n\n===''Ineffabilis Deus''===\nIt was popular support which led to the demand that the papacy elevate the doctrine to the status of dogma.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=6}} In 1830 [[Catherine Labour\u00e9]] (May 2, 1806-December 31, 1876) was granted a vision of Mary as the Immaculate Conception standing on a globe while a voice commanded Catherine to have a medal made in imitation of what she saw,{{sfn|Mack|2003}} and the apparition marked the beginning of a great 19th-century Marian revival.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=29}} At the time the church was engaged in a struggle against  modernity and the promotion of its authority,{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=249}} and in 1849 Pope [[Pius IX]] asked the bishops of the church for their views on whether the doctrine should be defined as dogma: ninety percent of those who responded were supportive, and in 1854 the papal bull ''Ineffabilis Deus'' was promulgated.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=153}} (A dogma is a divinely revealed truth proclaimed by the Church and binding on the faithful as necessary to salvation).{{sfn|O'Collins|1983|p=162}}\n\n''Ineffabilis Deus'' was one of the pivotal events of the papacy of Pius, pope from 16 June 1846 to his death on 7 February 1878.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=250}} Up until this point it had been understood that dogma had to be based in Scripture and acepted by tradition,{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} but Mary's immaculate conception is not stated in the New Testament and cannot be deduced from it,{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=35}} and it had caused a virtual civil war between [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s during the middle ages.{{sfn|Cameron|1996|p=335}} ''Ineffabilis Deus'' therefore was a novelty, being based instead on the declaration of a special commission to the effect that neither scripture nor tradition were necessary to define dogma, but only the authority of the church expressed in the Pope.{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} The Pope and his [[curia]] (the special body which forms the central government of the church) accordingly waived the absence of scriptural proof or a \"broad and ancient\" stream of tradition and promulgated Mary's immaculate conception solely on [[papal infallibility]],{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204-205}} itself promulgated as dogma in 1870.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}} (Catholics unable to accept papal infallibility left the Roman Church and formed the [[Old Catholic Church]], which rejects also the Immaculate Conception).{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Smit|2019|p=14,53}} Four years later, Mary reputedly appeared to the young [[Bernadette Soubirous]] at [[Loudes]] in southern France, to announce that she was the Immaculate Conception.{{sfn|Hammond|2003|p=602}}\n\nThe Archbishop of Paris had warned Pius that the Immaculate Conception \"could be proved neither from the Scriptures nor from tradition,\"{{sfn|Schaff|1931|p=unpaginated}} but ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' found it in the Ark of Salvation ([[Noah's Ark]]), [[Jacob's Ladder]], the [[Burning Bush]] at Sinai, the Enclosed Garden from the [[Song of Songs]], and many more.{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=35}} From this wealth of support the pope's advisors singled out [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]] as the basis for the Immaculate Conception: \"The most glorious Virgin ... was foretold by God when he said to the serpent: 'I will put enmity between you and the woman,'\"{{sfn|Manelli|1994|p=6-7}} a prophecy which reached fulfillment in the figure of the Woman in the [[Revelation of John]], crowned with stars and trampling the Dragon underfoot.{{sfn|Twomey|2008|p=73-74}} Luke 1:28, and specifically the phrase \"full of grace\" by which [[Gabriel]] greeted Mary, was another reference to her immaculate conception: \"she was never subject to the curse and was, together with her Son, the only partaker of perpetual benediction.\"{{sfn|German|2001|p=596}}\n\n==Feast and patronages==\n[[File:Quadrittu (cropped).jpg|thumb|The procession of the ''Quadrittu'' of the Immaculate Conception taken on December 7 in [[Saponara]], [[Sicily]]]]\n{{Main|Patronages of the Immaculate Conception}}\n{{Main|Feast of the Immaculate Conception}}\nThe feast day of the Immaculate Conception is December 8.{{sfn|Barrely|2014|p=40}} Its celebration seems to have begun in the Eastern church in the 7th century and may have spread to Ireland by the 8th, although the earliest well-attested record in the Western church is from England early in the 11th.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It was suppressed there after the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066), and the first thorough exposition of the doctrine was a response to this suppression.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It continued to spread despite strong theological objections{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=128}} (in 1125 [[St Bernard of Clairvaux]] wrote to Lyons Cathedral to express his surprise and concern that it had recently begun to be observed there),{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} but in 1477 [[Sixtus IV]], a Franciscan, placed it on the Roman calendar (i.e, list of Church festivals and observances).{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643}} [[Pius V]] suppressed it,{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=38}} but following the promulgation of ''Ineffabilis Deus'' it was restored with the typically Franciscan phrase \"immaculate conception\" and given a formulary for the Mass, drawn largely from one composed for Sixtus IV, beginning \"O God who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin...\". {{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643-644}}\n\nBy pontifical decree a number of countries are considered to be under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception. These include [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[South Korea|Korea]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]] (including the old kingdoms and the present state), the [[United States]] and [[Uruguay]]. By royal decree under the [[House of Bragan\u00e7a]], she is the principal Patroness of [[Portugal]].\n\n==Prayers and hymns==\nThe [[Roman Missal]] and the [[Roman Rite]] [[Liturgy of the Hours]] naturally includes references to Mary's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception. An example is the antiphon that begins: \"[[Tota pulchra es|Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula originalis non est in te]]\" (\"You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you.\" It continues: \"Your clothing is white as snow, and your face is like the sun.

Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the depiction of \"Our Lady\" seems to have been finally established by the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] in his  \"El arte de la pintura\" of 1649: a beautiful young girl of 12 or 13, wearing a white tunic and blue mantle, rays of light emanating from her head ringed by twelve stars and crowned by an imperial crown, the sun behind her and the moon beneath her feet.{{sfn|Moffitt|2001|p=676}} Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.{{sfn|Katz|Orsi|2001|p=98}} The popularity of this particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' spread across the rest of Europe, and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) God. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]]. In some paintings the putti are holding [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.{{sfn|Jenner|2009|p=3-9}}\n\n<br>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\n\nFile:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|[[Piero di Cosimo]], ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505\nFile:La Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n vista por San Juan Evangelista (Museo de Santa Cruz de Toledo).jpg|[[El Greco]], ''The Immaculate Conception with St John the Evangelist'', {{circa}} 1585\nFile:0 L'Immacul\u00e9e Conception - P.P.

from the moment of her [[Conception (biology)|conception]].{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=330}}<ref group=\"Notes\" name=\"Definition\">\"The Virgin Mary was preserved entirely free from original sin from the instant of her conception through a special prevenient grace, received in view of the merits of her Son in anticipation of the Redemption.\" See Reynolds (20102), p.330.</ref> It proved highly controversial in the Middle Ages, but revived in the 19th century and was adopted as church dogma when Pope [[Pius IX]] promulgated ''Ineffabilis Deus'' in 1854.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=153}}{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=250}} The move had the overwhelming support of the church's hierarchy, although a few, including the Archbishop of Paris, warned that it is not stated in the New Testament and could not be deduced from it.{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=35}} Protestants overwhelmingly rejected ''Ineffabilis Deus'' as an exercise in papal power and the doctrine itself as without foundation in Scripture,{{sfn|Herringer|2019|p=507}} and [[Orthodox Christianity]], although it reveres Mary in its liturgy, called on the Roman church to return to the faith of the early centuries.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1981|p=90}} The iconography of the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception shows her standing, with arms outspread or hands clasped in prayer, and her feast day is 8 December.{{sfn|Barrely|2014|p=40}}\n\n(The Immaculate Conception of Mary in the womb of her mother is not to be confused with her purity in the [[virgin birth of Jesus]]).{{sfn|Bromiley|1995|p=272}}\n\n==Doctrine==\n\nThe Immaculate Conception of Mary is one of the four [[Mariology|Marian]] dogmas of the Catholic Church, meaning that it is held to be a truth divinely revealed, the denial of which is [[heresy]].{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=133}} Defined by [[Pope Pius IX]] in 1854, it states that Mary, through God's grace, was conceived free from the stain of [[original sin]] in view of her role as the [[Mother of God]]:{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=209}}\n\n<blockquote>\nWe declare, pronounce, and define that the doctrine which holds that the most Blessed Virgin Mary, in the first instance of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Jesus Christ, the Saviour of the human race, was preserved free from all stain of original sin, is a doctrine revealed by God and therefore to be believed firmly and constantly by all the faithful.{{sfn|Sheed|1958|p=134-138}}\n</blockquote>\n\nWhile the doctrine asserts only Mary's freedom from original sin, the [[Council of Trent]], held between 1545 and 1563, affirmed in addition her freedom from personal sin.{{sfn|Fastiggi|2019|p=455}}\n\n==History==\n{{Catholic marian prayers sidebar}}\n===Anna, mother of Mary===\nThe mother of Mary is not a biblical character.{{sfn|Nixon|2004|p=11}} She first appears in the late 2nd-century [[Protevangelium of James]], which names her [[Saint Anne|Anne]], probably from [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]], the mother of the prophet [[Samuel]]; she and her husband, [[Saint Joachim]], are infertile, but God hears their prayers for a child, and so Mary is conceived and born, and, like Samuel, is taken to spend her childhood in the temple.{{sfn|Nixon|2004|p=11-12}} In the earliest texts, probably representing the original version, the conception occurs without [[sexual intercourse]] between Anne and Joachim, but the story does not advance the idea of an immaculate conception.{{sfn|Shoemaker|2016|p=unpaginated}} The Protevangelium does not advance the idea that Mary was conceived without [[original sin]].{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} \n\n===Original sin===\nOriginal sin was defined by [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354-430 AD).{{sfn|Wiley|2002|p=37}} Engaged in a controversy with the monk [[Pelagius]] over the question of whether infants could sin (Pelagius said they could not and therefore would not go to hell if unbaptised), he inserted original sin and the fall from grace into the story of the [[Garden of Eden]] and Paul's [[Letter to the Romans]],{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=41}} it is not part of the story of [[Adam and Eve]]{{sfn|Toews|2013|pp=88}} and the [[Apostle Paul]] regarded sin and death not as a punishment for Adam's sin but as the natural lot of mankind.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=301}} Augustine also identified male semen as the means by which original sin was made heritable, leaving only Jesus Christ, conceived without semen, free of the sin passed down from Adam through the sexual act,{{sfn|Stortz|2001|pp=93\u201494}} a sentiment echoed as late as 1930 by Pope [[Pius XI]] in his ''Casti Conubii'': \"The natural generation of life has become the path of death by which original sin is communicated to the children.\"{{sfn|Obach|2008|p=43}}\n\n===Medieval formulation===\n[[File:Lusenberg-Immaculata-1876.jpg|thumb|220px|''Altar of the Immaculata'' by [[Josef Moroder-Lusenberg|Joseph Lusenberg]], 1876. Saint Antony's Church, [[Urtij\u00ebi]], Italy.]]\nMary's [[sinlessness of Mary|freedom from personal sin]] was affirmed in the 4th century, but Augustine's argument that original sin was transmitted through sex raised the question of whether she could also be free of the sin of Adam.{{sfn|Collinge|2012|p=209}} The English ecclesiastic and scholar [[Eadmer]] (c.1060-c.1126) reasoned that it was possible in view of God's omnipotence and appropriate in view of Mary's role as [[Mother of God]]: ''Potuit, decuit, fecit'', \"it was possible, it was fitting, therefore it was done;\"{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=36-37}} [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090-1153) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225-1274), among others, objected that if Mary were free of original sin at her conception then she would have no need of redemption, making Christ superfluous; they were answered answered by [[Duns Scotus]] (1264-1308), who reasoned that her preservation from original sin was a redemption more perfect than that granted through Christ.{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=37-38}} \n\nNevertheless, it was not theological theory that initiated discussion of Mary's freedom from mankind's curse, but the celebration of her [[liturgy]], for the popular feast of her conception brought forth the objection that as sexual intercourse is sinful, to celebrate Mary's conception was to celebrate a sinful event.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} Some held that no sin had occurred, for Anne had conceived Mary not through sex but by kissing her husband Joachim, and that Anne's father and mother had likewise been conceived; but [[St Bridget of Sweden]] (c.1303-1373) told how Mary herself had revealed to her in a vision that although Anne and Joachim conceived their daughter through sexual union, the act was sinless because free of sexual desire.{{sfn|Solberg|2018|p=108-109}} \n\nIn 1431 the [[Council of Basel]] declared Mary's immaculate conception a \"pious opinion\" consistent with faith and Scripture; the [[Council of Trent]], held in several sessions in the early 1500s, made no explicit declaration on the subject but exempted her from the universality of original sin; and by 1571 the Pope's [[Breviary]] (prayerbook) set out an elaborate celebration of the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December.{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=4-5,117}}\n\n===''Ineffabilis Deus''===\nIt was popular support which led to the demand that the papacy elevate the doctrine to the status of dogma.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=6}} In 1830 [[Catherine Labour\u00e9]] (May 2, 1806-December 31, 1876) was granted a vision of Mary as the Immaculate Conception standing on a globe while a voice commanded Catherine to have a medal made in imitation of what she saw,{{sfn|Mack|2003}} and the apparition marked the beginning of a great 19th-century Marian revival.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=29}} At the time the church was engaged in a struggle against  modernity and the promotion of its authority,{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=249}} and in 1849 Pope [[Pius IX]] asked the bishops of the church for their views on whether the doctrine should be defined as dogma: ninety percent of those who responded were supportive, and in 1854 the papal bull ''Ineffabilis Deus'' was promulgated.{{sfn|Foley|2002|p=153}} (A dogma is a divinely revealed truth proclaimed by the Church and binding on the faithful as necessary to salvation).{{sfn|O'Collins|1983|p=162}}\n\n''Ineffabilis Deus'' was one of the pivotal events of the papacy of Pius, pope from 16 June 1846 to his death on 7 February 1878.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=250}} Up until this point it had been understood that dogma had to be based in Scripture and acepted by tradition,{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} but Mary's immaculate conception is not stated in the New Testament and cannot be deduced from it,{{sfn|Coyle|1996|p=35}} and it had caused a virtual civil war between [[Franciscan]]s and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s during the middle ages.{{sfn|Cameron|1996|p=335}} ''Ineffabilis Deus'' therefore was a novelty, being based instead on the declaration of a special commission to the effect that neither scripture nor tradition were necessary to define dogma, but only the authority of the church expressed in the Pope.{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204}} The Pope and his [[curia]] (the special body which forms the central government of the church) accordingly waived the absence of scriptural proof or a \"broad and ancient\" stream of tradition and promulgated Mary's immaculate conception solely on [[papal infallibility]],{{sfn|Lohse|1966|p=204-205}} itself promulgated as dogma in 1870.{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}} (Catholics unable to accept papal infallibility left the Roman Church and formed the [[Old Catholic Church]], which rejects also the Immaculate Conception).{{sfn|Hillerbrand|2012|p=63}}{{sfn|Smit|2019|p=14,53}} Four years later, Mary reputedly appeared to the young [[Bernadette Soubirous]] at [[Loudes]] in southern France, to announce that she was the Immaculate Conception.{{sfn|Hammond|2003|p=602}}\n\nThe Archbishop of Paris had warned Pius that the Immaculate Conception \"could be proved neither from the Scriptures nor from tradition,\"{{sfn|Schaff|1931|p=unpaginated}} but ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' found it in the Ark of Salvation ([[Noah's Ark]]), [[Jacob's Ladder]], the [[Burning Bush]] at Sinai, the Enclosed Garden from the [[Song of Songs]], and many more.{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=35}} From this wealth of support the pope's advisors singled out [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]] as the basis for the Immaculate Conception: \"The most glorious Virgin ... was foretold by God when he said to the serpent: 'I will put enmity between you and the woman,'\"{{sfn|Manelli|1994|p=6-7}} a prophecy which reached fulfillment in the figure of the Woman in the [[Revelation of John]], crowned with stars and trampling the Dragon underfoot.{{sfn|Twomey|2008|p=73-74}} Luke 1:28, and specifically the phrase \"full of grace\" by which [[Gabriel]] greeted Mary, was another reference to her immaculate conception: \"she was never subject to the curse and was, together with her Son, the only partaker of perpetual benediction.\"{{sfn|German|2001|p=596}}\n\n==Feast and patronages==\n[[File:Quadrittu (cropped).jpg|thumb|The

Ireland by the 8th, although the earliest well-attested record in the Western church is from England early in the 11th.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It was suppressed there after the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066), and the first thorough exposition of the doctrine was a response to this suppression.{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=124}} It continued to spread despite strong theological objections{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=128}} (in 1125 [[St Bernard of Clairvaux]] wrote to Lyons Cathedral to express his surprise and concern that it had recently begun to be observed there),{{sfn|Boss|2000|p=126}} but in 1477 [[Sixtus IV]], a Franciscan, placed it on the Roman calendar (i.e, list of Church festivals and observances).{{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643}} [[Pius V]] suppressed it,{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez|2019|p=38}} but following the promulgation of ''Ineffabilis Deus'' it was restored with the typically Franciscan phrase \"immaculate conception\" and given a formulary for the Mass, drawn largely from one composed for Sixtus IV, beginning \"O God who by the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin...\". {{sfn|Manelli|2008|p=643-644}}\n\nBy pontifical decree a number of countries are considered to be under the patronage of the Immaculate Conception. These include [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[South Korea|Korea]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Paraguay]], the [[Philippines]], [[Spain]] (including the old kingdoms and the present state), the [[United States]] and [[Uruguay]]. By royal decree under the [[House of Bragan\u00e7a]], she is the principal Patroness of [[Portugal]].\n\n==Prayers and hymns==\nThe [[Roman Missal]] and the [[Roman Rite]] [[Liturgy of the Hours]] naturally includes references to Mary's immaculate conception in the feast of the Immaculate Conception. An example is the antiphon that begins: \"[[Tota pulchra es|Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula originalis non est in te]]\" (\"You are all beautiful, Mary, and the original stain [of sin] is not in you.\" It continues: \"Your clothing is white as snow, and your face is like the sun.

Many artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the depiction of \"Our Lady\" seems to have been finally established by the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]] in his  \"El arte de la pintura\" of 1649: a beautiful young girl of 12 or 13, wearing a white tunic and blue mantle, rays of light emanating from her head ringed by twelve stars and crowned by an imperial crown, the sun behind her and the moon beneath her feet.{{sfn|Moffitt|2001|p=676}} Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.{{sfn|Katz|Orsi|2001|p=98}} The popularity of this particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' spread across the rest of Europe, and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) God. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]].

In Query 31 of the ''Opticks'', Newton simultaneously made an argument from design and for the necessity of intervention:\n{{quote| For while comets move in very eccentric orbs in all manner of positions, blind fate could never make all the planets move one and the same way in orbs concentric, some inconsiderable irregularities excepted which may have arisen from the mutual actions of comets and planets on one another, and which will be apt to increase, till this system wants a reformation.<ref>Newton, 1706 ''Opticks'' (2nd Edition), quoted in H. G. Alexander 1956 (ed): ''The Leibniz-Clarke correspondence'', University of Manchester Press.</ref>}}\nThis passage prompted an attack by Leibniz in a letter to his friend [[Caroline of Ansbach]]:\n{{quote|Sir Isaac Newton and his followers have also a very odd opinion concerning the work of God. According to their doctrine, God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. He had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.<ref>Leibniz, first letter, in Alexander 1956, p. 11</ref>}}\nLeibniz's letter initiated the [[Leibniz-Clarke correspondence]], ostensibly with Newton's friend and disciple [[Samuel Clarke]], although as Caroline wrote, Clarke's letters \"are not written without the advice of the Chev.

This position, in Cragg's view, leads to the elimination of the Christian revelation as neither necessary nor sufficient for human knowledge of God. This agenda is indeed the key point, as Leland describes above, of the deistic program which seeks to \"set aside\" revelatory religious texts.

A note is attached to the Bible indicating that it \"was given by Sir Isaac Newton in his last illness to the woman who nursed him\". The book was eventually bequeathed to the Library in 1878. The places Newton marked or annotated in his Bible bear witness to his investigations into theology, chronology, alchemy, and natural philosophy; and some of these actually relate to passages of the ''General Scholium'' to the second edition of the ''Principia''. Some other passages he marked offer glimpses of his devotional practices and reveal distinct tensions in his personality.

They applied the [[day-year principle]] (in which a day represents a year in prophecy) to certain key verses in the books of Daniel<ref>the \"time, times and half a time\" of Daniel 7:25 and 12:7</ref> and Revelation<ref>the \"42 months\" of Revelation 11:2 and 13:5 equals the \"1260 days\" of Revelation 11:3 and 12:6</ref> (also known as the Apocalypse), and looked for significant dates in the Papacy's rise to power to begin this timeline. Newton's calculation ending in 2060 is based on the 1,260-year timeline commencing in 800 AD when [[Charlemagne]] became the first Holy Roman Emperor and reconfirmed the earlier (756 AD) [[Donation of Pepin]] to the Papacy.<ref name=\"paper\"/>\n\n=== 2016 vs 2060 ===\n\nHowever, between the time he wrote his 2060 prediction (about 1704) until his death in 1727 Newton conversed, both first hand and by correspondence, with other famous theologians of his time. Those contemporaries who knew him during the remaining 23 years of his life appear to be in agreement that Newton, and the \"best interpreters\" including [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[Robert Fleming the younger|Robert Fleming]], [[Moses Lowman]], [[Phillip Doddridge]], and Bishop [[Thomas Newton]], were eventually \"pretty well agreed\" that the 1,260-year timeline should be calculated from the year 756 AD.<ref>Jonathan Edwards \u201dHistory of Redemption\" New York: T. and J. Swords (1793) page 431: \"The Beginning of the reign of Antichrist.] The best interpreters (as Mr. Fleming, Sir I. Newton, Mr. Lowman, Dr. Doddridge, Bp. Newton, and Mr. Reader) are pretty well agreed that this reign is to be dated from about A. D. 756, when the Pope began to be a temporal power, (that is, in prophetic language, a beast) by assuming temporal dominion; 1260 years from this period will bring us to about A. D. 2000, and about the 6000th year of the world, which agrees with a tradition at least as ancient as the epistle ascribed to the apostle Barnabas (f 15.] which says, that \" in six thousand years shall all things be accomplished.\"</ref>\n\nF.A. Cox also confirmed that this was the view of Newton and others, including himself:\n\n{{bquote | ''\"The author adopts the hypothesis of Fleming, Sir Isaac Newton, and Lowman, that the 1260 years commenced in A.d. 756; and consequently that the millennium will not begin till the year 2016\".''<ref>Rev.

Sumner (1837) Vol. 2-page 1417</ref>}}\n \nIn April of 756 AD, [[Pepin the Short|Pepin]], King of France, accompanied by [[Pope Stephen II]] entered northern Italy, forcing the Lombard King [[Aistulf]] to lift his siege of Rome, and return to [[Pavia]]. Following Aistulf's capitulation, Pepin gave the newly conquered territories to the Papacy by means of the [[Donation of Pepin]], thereby elevating the Pope from being a subject of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to [[head of state]], with [[temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] over the newly constituted [[Papal States]].\n\nThe end of the timeline is based on Daniel 8:25 which reads ''\"...but he shall be broken without hand\"'' and is understood to mean that the end of the Papacy will not be caused by any human action.<ref>Bishop Thomas Newton \"DISSERTATIONS ON THE PROPHECIES\" London: J.F. and C.

Unaware that Papal rule would be restored, (albeit on a greatly diminished scale) in 1929 as head of the [[Vatican City]] state, the historicist view that the Papacy is the Antichrist and the associated timelines delineating his rule rapidly declined in popularity as one of the defining characteristics of the Antichrist (i.e. that he would also be a political temporal power at the time of the return of Jesus) were no longer met.\n\nEventually, the prediction was largely forgotten and no major Protestant denomination currently subscribes to this timeline.\n\nDespite the dramatic nature of a prediction of the end of the world, Newton may not have been referring to the 2060 date as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the earth and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian theology, this concept is often referred to as The [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the establishment of [[Paradise]] by The [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth.<ref name=Snobelen/>\n\n==Other beliefs==\n{{Main|Isaac Newton's occult studies}}\n[[File:Isaac Newton grave in Westminster Abbey.jpg|thumb|upright|Newton's grave in [[Westminster Abbey]]]]\n[[Henry More]]'s belief in the universe and rejection of [[Cartesian dualism]] may have influenced Newton's religious ideas.

This agenda is indeed the key point, as Leland describes above, of the deistic program which seeks to \"set aside\" revelatory religious texts.

They applied the [[day-year principle]] (in which a day represents a year in prophecy) to certain key verses in the books of Daniel<ref>the \"time, times and half a time\" of Daniel 7:25 and 12:7</ref> and Revelation<ref>the \"42 months\" of Revelation 11:2 and 13:5 equals the \"1260 days\" of Revelation 11:3 and 12:6</ref> (also known as the Apocalypse), and looked for significant dates in the Papacy's rise to power to begin this timeline. Newton's calculation ending in 2060 is based on the 1,260-year timeline commencing in 800 AD when [[Charlemagne]] became the first Holy Roman Emperor and reconfirmed the earlier (756 AD) [[Donation of Pepin]] to the Papacy.<ref name=\"paper\"/>\n\n=== 2016 vs 2060 ===\n\nHowever, between the time he wrote his 2060 prediction (about 1704) until his death in 1727 Newton conversed, both first hand and by correspondence, with other famous theologians of his time. Those contemporaries who knew him during the remaining 23 years of his life appear to be in agreement that Newton, and the \"best interpreters\" including [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]], [[Robert Fleming the younger|Robert Fleming]], [[Moses Lowman]], [[Phillip Doddridge]], and Bishop [[Thomas Newton]], were eventually \"pretty well agreed\" that the 1,260-year timeline should be calculated from the year 756 AD.<ref>Jonathan Edwards \u201dHistory of Redemption\" New York: T. and J. Swords (1793) page 431: \"The Beginning of the reign of Antichrist.] The best interpreters (as Mr. Fleming, Sir I. Newton, Mr. Lowman, Dr. Doddridge, Bp. Newton, and Mr. Reader) are pretty well agreed that this reign is to be dated from about A.

D. 2000, and about the 6000th year of the world, which agrees with a tradition at least as ancient as the epistle ascribed to the apostle Barnabas (f 15.] which says, that \" in six thousand years shall all things be accomplished.\"</ref>\n\nF.A. Cox also confirmed that this was the view of Newton and others, including himself:\n\n{{bquote | ''\"The author adopts the hypothesis of Fleming, Sir Isaac Newton, and Lowman, that the 1260 years commenced in A.d. 756; and consequently that the millennium will not begin till the year 2016\".''<ref>Rev.

Following Aistulf's capitulation, Pepin gave the newly conquered territories to the Papacy by means of the [[Donation of Pepin]], thereby elevating the Pope from being a subject of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to [[head of state]], with [[temporal power (papal)|temporal power]] over the newly constituted [[Papal States]].\n\nThe end of the timeline is based on Daniel 8:25 which reads ''\"...but he shall be broken without hand\"'' and is understood to mean that the end of the Papacy will not be caused by any human action.<ref>Bishop Thomas Newton \"DISSERTATIONS ON THE PROPHECIES\" London: J.F. and C.

Unaware that Papal rule would be restored, (albeit on a greatly diminished scale) in 1929 as head of the [[Vatican City]] state, the historicist view that the Papacy is the Antichrist and the associated timelines delineating his rule rapidly declined in popularity as one of the defining characteristics of the Antichrist (i.e. that he would also be a political temporal power at the time of the return of Jesus) were no longer met.\n\nEventually, the prediction was largely forgotten and no major Protestant denomination currently subscribes to this timeline.\n\nDespite the dramatic nature of a prediction of the end of the world, Newton may not have been referring to the 2060 date as a destructive act resulting in the annihilation of the earth and its inhabitants, but rather one in which he believed the world was to be replaced with a new one based upon a transition to an era of divinely inspired peace. In Christian theology, this concept is often referred to as The [[Second Coming]] of [[Jesus Christ]] and the establishment of [[Paradise]] by The [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth.<ref name=Snobelen/>\n\n==Other beliefs==\n{{Main|Isaac Newton's occult studies}}\n[[File:Isaac Newton grave in Westminster Abbey.jpg|thumb|upright|Newton's grave in [[Westminster Abbey]]]]\n[[Henry More]]'s belief in the universe and rejection of [[Cartesian dualism]] may have influenced Newton's religious ideas.

Hirschberg and Talbi note that Ibn Khaldun seems to have been referring to a time before the advent of the late [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] empires, and a little later in the same paragraph seems to say that by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times \"the tribes\" had become [[Christianized]]. As early as 1963, the Israeli historian H.Z. Hirschberg, in retranslating the text of Ibn Khaldun and rigorously repeating the whole document, questioned this interpretation, and in general the existence of large Jewish Berber tribes in the end of Antiquity.<ref name=\"EB1306\" /> In the words of H.Z.

A number of them refer to her long [[hair]] or great size, both legendary characteristics of [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]]. She is also supposed to have had the gift of [[prophecy]] and she had three sons, which is characteristic of witches in legends. Even the fact that two were her own and one was adopted (an [[Arab]] officer she had captured) was an alleged trait of sorcerers in tales. Another [[legend]] claims that in her youth, she had supposedly freed her people from a [[tyrant]] by agreeing to marry him and then murdering him on their [[wedding]] night. Virtually nothing else of her personal life is known.{{According to whom|date=May 2016}}\n\n== Conflicts and legends ==\n\nDihya succeeded [[Kusaila]] as the war leader of the [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes in the 680s and opposed the encroaching Arab Islamic armies of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Dynasty]]. [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]] marched from [[Egypt]] and captured the major [[Byzantine]] city of [[Carthage]] and other cities (see [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest of North Africa]]). Searching for another enemy to defeat, he was told that the most powerful monarch in North Africa was \"the Queen of the Berbers\" (Arabic: ''malikat al-barbar'') Dihy\u0101, and accordingly marched into [[Numidia]]. In 698, the armies met near [[Meskiana]]<ref>Talbi (1971) suggests that based on the topography reported by al-M\u0101lik\u012b, the actual battlefield was the Wadi N\u012bn\u012b.</ref> in the present-day province of [[Oum el-Bouaghi Province|Oum el-Bouaghi]] at the {{ill|Battle of Meskiana|fr|Bataille de l'oued Nini}} (or \"battle of camels\") in [[Algeria]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Philippe S\u00e9nac|author2=Patrice Cressier|title=Histoire du Maghreb m\u00e9di\u00e9val: VIIe-XIe si\u00e8cle|editor=Armand Colin|year=2012|page=111|language=French|isbn=}}</ref> She defeated Hasan so soundly that he fled [[Ifriqiya]] and holed up in [[Cyrenaica]] (Libya) for four or five years. Realizing that the enemy was too powerful and bound to return, she was said to have embarked on a [[scorched earth]] campaign, which had little impact on the mountain and desert tribes, but lost her the crucial support of the sedentary oasis-dwellers. Instead of discouraging the Arab armies, her desperate decision hastened defeat.<ref>However, even if true, the Arab accounts are considered to be greatly exaggerated. See Talbi (1971) and Mod\u00e9ran (2005). One thing that is certain is that Dihy\u0101 loved ornithology.</ref>\n\nThe story of the Kahina is told by a variety of cultures, and each story often offers a different, or even contradictory, perspective. For example, the story is used to promote feminist beliefs. Additionally, it is even told by Arabs to promote their own nationalism. For the Arabs, they told the story in a perspective that made the Kahina seem like a sorcerer, all in an attempt to discredit her. Some Arab historians took it even farther by saying that the Kahina eventually tried to have her sons adopt Islam as their religion. Another group that told the story of the Kahina was the French. The story of the Kahina was told to paint colonialism in a positive light. The story was told with a message saying that it represented the freeing of Berbers from the Arabs.<ref name=Becker>Becker, Cynthia, [http://www.mizanproject.org/the-kahina-the-female-face-of-berber-history/#_ftn2 \"The Kahina: The Female Face of Berber History\"].

This final act occurred in the 690s or 700s, with 703 CE given as the most likely year.<ref name=\"EB1306\" /> In that year, she was, according to [[Ibn Khaldun]], 127 years old. This is evidently yet another of the many myths which surround her.\n\nAccording to many historians,{{Who|date=June 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} her sons Bagay and Khanchla converted, and led the Berber army to [[Iberia]].

Her face is often seen in graffiti and sculptures around Algeria to showcase their support for the progressive ideals she represents. While her true appearance is still unknown, artists have depicted her with certain aspects that reinforce the progressive movement she is known to represent.
