As much of Mama's time on ''Mama's Family'' was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping [[apron]].

Lawrence recognized the modifications early on and disapproved. She has revealed that she originally found the softening of the \"Mama\" character to be unfunny. However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the \"Ed\" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from \"The Family\" sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence |title=Vicki Lawrence Interview &#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Persona evolution===\nThe character of \"Mama\" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice.<ref name=\"origin\">McMahon, Tom (15 November 1986). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cZE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2947,3546407&dq=carol-burnett+mama&hl=en No sour grapes from Carol Burnett], ''Montreal Gazette''</ref> Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from [[Missouri]] in the genesis of Mama.<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#</ref>\n\n===Mama's catch phrases===\nUnlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is ''\"Good Lord!\"'' also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as ''\"Good Lord in heaven!\"'' or ''\"Good night Louise!\"'' Among her other locutions included ''\"Now hear this!\"'' ''\"Hell's bells!\"'' ''\"God-awful!\"'' ''\"The hell you say,\"'' ''\"Smut,\"'' ''\"For heaven's sake!\"'' ''\"For crying out loud!\"'' ''\"In a pig's eye,\"'' ''\"Shoot!\"'' ''\"Real good,\"'' ''\"Oh I bet the neighbors are just lovin' this.\"'' etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as ''\"Nitwit,\"'' ''\"Dimwit,\"'' ''\"Goon,\"'' ''\"Goober Goon,\"'' ''\"Lamebrain,\"'' ''\"Dunce,\"'' ''\"Tramp,\"'' etc.\n\n==Evolution of family members' personas==\nUnlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in \"The Family\" sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of ''Mama's Family'', the supporting characters in the second life of ''Mama's Family'' weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of ''Mama's Family'' was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma & family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.\n\n== Mama's life history ==\nIn \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: [[Ellen Harper|Ellen]], [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]], Philip Harper, Larry, and Jack. This created marked [[plothole]]s as in the \"Eunice\" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip Harper. In ''[[Mama's Family]]'', they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by [[Vinton \"Vint\" Harper|Vinton]]. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an [[unseen character]], portrayed in voice only. In the movie ''Eunice'' Carl was voiced by [[Dick Clair]] and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during \"Mama's Family.\" (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)\n\nThelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, [[Ed Higgins|Ed]], was the ongoing theme of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nIn ''Mama's Family'', Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer [[Fran Crowley]]. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper Jr. and [[Sonja Harper]], move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to become a cocktail waitress.\n\nVinton soon marries [[Naomi Harper]], Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.\n\nThelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.\n\nThelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, [[Iola Boylan]], who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the [[NBC]] episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola  spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma ''do'' have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.\n\nAfter Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.\n\nThelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: ''\"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!\"'') Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba makes a tearful and heartfelt apology to Thelma, swearing off beer from that point forward, and Thelma, seeing how remorseful Bubba was for the incident, gladly forgives him and lifts his punishment.\n\nThelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: \"Old lady\". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, ''\"Get the hell out of my life!\"''\n\nThelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, \"Food Circus\", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.\n\nOne of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.\n\nAs a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, [[Alberta Meechum]], who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge \"no-no\".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later [[Marge Redmond]]), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is [[illiterate]]. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend [[Lloyd Meechum]], the man who married Vint and Naomi, although he has no real grudge against her like his wife.. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.\n\nThelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire [[dysfunctional family]] move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill. To Thelma's shock, the house she had lived in since she was married had once been a brothel where the town's founder, James A. Ray, died. Thus, it was made a Raytown historical landmark, to mayor [[Alvin Tutweiler]]'s chagrin, and her neighbors ire. They wanted a lot of money to leave that neighborhood and lose Thelma as a neighbor, but it was not to be. Even Iola was irate.\n\n==Post-television show appearances==\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, 2009]]\nLawrence has resurrected the character of Thelma (still in her late sixties) several times on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', on stage in her two-woman show, on her talk show in the early 1990s, on the TNN talk show Primetime Country and in the 2008 TV Land Awards, and on numerous comedy tours.\n\nThelma \"wrote\" a book in 2008 entitled ''Mama for President''.<ref name=\"ref9of100\">Harper, Thelma with Vicki Lawrence & Monty Aidem.

She ended up winning $8,000 [[USD]], getting nine out of ten questions correct, and opted not to answer the eleventh question (the bonus question), as missing that question results in a loss of all the player's winnings.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Thelma was seen once again on Logo's ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]'' as the special comedian in which the contestants had to interact and have a comedic sketch.

She is a [[senior citizen]] who has lived in an unspecified part in the [[Southern United States]] for her entire life which is evident by the [[Southern American English|southern]] [[drawl]] of her speech and her customs.  She is an exaggerated version of a prototype middle twentieth century lower middle class grandmother in the United States South.

She is a buxom, pursed-lipped widow, with silvery blue curls. All of her outfits have consisted of various short-sleeved, floral-print dresses that carry lace collars. As much of Mama's time on ''Mama's Family'' was spent cooking and cleaning, her dresses were often worn with an overlapping [[apron]]. Mama's lower legs have been clasped by visible support hose since the outset of ''Mama's Family''; she wore no support hose during \"The Family\" sketches nor the ''Eunice'' movie.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=758mUmQxV6gC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+Mama's+orthopedic+shoes&source=bl&ots=duy-zxLKkw&sig=So6pPTb4V_ZePwU42hrRObEh4K8&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OvM5UfumGqrr2QWShIEY&ved=0CGIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=Vicki%20Lawrence%20Mama's%20orthopedic%20shoes&f=false |title=Funny Ladies - Michael Karol - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref> For [[footwear]], Mama has invariably worn white, orthopedic shoes of a [[High-heeled footwear|high heeled]] [[brogue shoe|brogue]] style.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DuoCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA96&dq=Mama's+Family+Thelma+Harper&hl=en&sa=X&ei=iPA5Ua3WH4bk2AWnw4GgCw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=Mama's%20Family%20Thelma%20Harper&f=false |title=Indianapolis Monthly - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-09}}</ref>\n\nMama has also invariably worn a few [[fashion accessory|fashion accessories]]: a white pearl necklace and white pearl earrings. \n \nMama's outerwear has always consisted of the same purple sweater, worn casually, draped over her shoulders without arms in the sleeves; inconstant floral [[headpiece]]s; and a white purse, which she didn't hesitate to use as a weapon when given the opportunity.\n\n==Mama's persona==\n\n===Vicki Lawrence on Mama's persona evolution===\n\nThe persona of the \"Mama\" character was revolutionized as between \"The Family\" sketches and the first life of ''Mama's Family''. Lawrence recognized the modifications early on and disapproved. She has revealed that she originally found the softening of the \"Mama\" character to be unfunny. However, Lawrence has stated that after counsel about the character needing reshaping to fit sitcom television from Harvey Korman (played the \"Ed\" character), she came to accept and later embrace the adjusted version of Mama. She has stated that to this day, she appreciates how the character has \"blossomed\" and \"matured\" from \"The Family\" sketches. The original writers of the character had based Mama on their real-life family members and thus disapproved of the adjustments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence |title=Vicki Lawrence Interview &#124; Archive of American Television |publisher=Emmytvlegends.org |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref>\n\n===Persona evolution===\nThe character of \"Mama\" was originally based, at least in part, on the relationship between Carol Burnett's mother and grandmother and was intended to be a maternal, elderly version of Eunice.<ref name=\"origin\">McMahon, Tom (15 November 1986). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cZE0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RKgFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2947,3546407&dq=carol-burnett+mama&hl=en No sour grapes from Carol Burnett], ''Montreal Gazette''</ref> Lawrence has noted that she also used her southern ex-mother-in-law and her own grandmother from [[Missouri]] in the genesis of Mama.<ref>http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#</ref>\n\n===Mama's catch phrases===\nUnlike the sketches and the television movie, Mama had several locutions in the sitcom. Her most frequently used locution in the series is ''\"Good Lord!\"'' also occasionally stated in alternate ways, such as ''\"Good Lord in heaven!\"'' or ''\"Good night Louise!\"'' Among her other locutions included ''\"Now hear this!\"'' ''\"Hell's bells!\"'' ''\"God-awful!\"'' ''\"The hell you say,\"'' ''\"Smut,\"'' ''\"For heaven's sake!\"'' ''\"For crying out loud!\"'' ''\"In a pig's eye,\"'' ''\"Shoot!\"'' ''\"Real good,\"'' ''\"Oh I bet the neighbors are just lovin' this.\"'' etc. Thelma also had a series of name-calling catch phrases she often used to refer to certain members of her family or her family as a whole, such as ''\"Nitwit,\"'' ''\"Dimwit,\"'' ''\"Goon,\"'' ''\"Goober Goon,\"'' ''\"Lamebrain,\"'' ''\"Dunce,\"'' ''\"Tramp,\"'' etc.\n\n==Evolution of family members' personas==\nUnlike the ill-tempered and stormy personalities alongside Mama in \"The Family\" sketches and the assertive and forceful personalities in the first life of ''Mama's Family'', the supporting characters in the second life of ''Mama's Family'' weren't nearly as quarrelsome or assertive. Due to the supporting characters being more easily subjugated and Mama's own adjustments, the second life of ''Mama's Family'' was much more lighthearted, less serious, and less contentious than all previous Thelma & family broadcasts. There are some moments, though, in the show's second life in which the supporting characters band together against Mama with petulant complaints and finger-pointing, causing heated arguments to ensue.\n\n== Mama's life history ==\nIn \"[[The Family (sketch)|The Family]]\" sketches, Thelma and her late husband, Carl Harper, have five children: [[Ellen Harper|Ellen]], [[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice]], Philip Harper, Larry, and Jack. This created marked [[plothole]]s as in the \"Eunice\" TV movie, they have three children: Ellen, Eunice, and Phillip Harper. In ''[[Mama's Family]]'', they have three children, but the character of Phillip is replaced by [[Vinton \"Vint\" Harper|Vinton]]. Thelma's husband, Carl, is a deceased character in all three broadcasts. He's only present in flashbacks as an [[unseen character]], portrayed in voice only. In the movie ''Eunice'' Carl was voiced by [[Dick Clair]] and was heard from the main floor bathroom. Thelma is in her late sixties during \"Mama's Family.\" (Vicki Lawrence was in her thirties during this time and would not turn sixty until 2009.)\n\nThelma's squabbles, resulting from her ingratitude and spite for her daughter Eunice and Eunice's husband, [[Ed Higgins|Ed]], was the ongoing theme of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nIn ''Mama's Family'', Thelma lived originally with her sister, newspaper writer [[Fran Crowley]]. In the first episode, Vinton and his two children, Vinton \"Buzz\" Harper Jr. and [[Sonja Harper]], move in with Thelma after being evicted from their house. Vinton has just gone through a divorce from a woman named Mitzi, who moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] to become a cocktail waitress.\n\nVinton soon marries [[Naomi Harper]], Thelma's next door neighbor, whom Thelma despises. Thelma becomes so enraptured and relieved to find out Naomi, Vint and the kids are going to move to Arizona to run a trailer park, that she consents to having them marry in her living room. Following the wedding, they all return to Thelma's house to stay because Naomi's partner in the trailer park venture has absconded with every cent of Vint and Naomi's life's savings and had never actually owned a trailer park.\n\nThelma's relationships with her grandchildren are different than those with her children. She gets along rather well with Buzz, since he isn't always worrying her into the grave, the way his older sister does and Thelma's own children had done when they were younger.\n\nThelma is best friends with her neighbor across the street, [[Iola Boylan]], who is crazy about Vinton and agrees with Thelma that Naomi wasn't the right kind of wife for him. In fact, Iola, who did not appear in the [[NBC]] episodes but makes her debut in the first episode of the third season, thinks she would be Vint's perfect mate. Thelma and Iola  spend a great deal of time together, and Iola often comes over for dinner when she isn't helping her eccentric and infirmed parents. Although they are best friends, Iola and Thelma ''do'' have their share of disagreements as well, most of which are instigated by outside forces.\n\nAfter Buzz and Sonja move out of the house for parts unknown and Fran dies in 1986, Thelma is joined by her other grandson, Bubba, Eunice and Ed's son. Her relationship with him is vastly different from the one she had with Buzz. Bubba is his mother's son, and while not as contentious and selfish as Eunice was, he is just as headstrong and stubborn, although he matured as the series progressed. He makes no fan of his Uncle Vint and Aunt Naomi when he is given Fran's old bedroom, meaning their bedroom will remain in the basement. Thelma did this because she wanted his bedroom to be next to hers, enabling her to keep better watch over him. However, with Bubba's parents having left him in Raytown while moving to Florida without telling him, Vint and Naomi were not about to begrudge him a bedroom.\n\nThelma has a very strong aversion to her grandchildren drinking to excess. In one instance, when Bubba comes home drunk after several beers, she punished him harshly. At first, nobody in her family understands why, considering that she regularly drinks beer, until Iola tells everyone about a terrible situation with Bubba's mother, Eunice. During a Mother-Daughter banquet several years before, presumably in the 1950s, Eunice showed up quite intoxicated. Then, during a song, Eunice and Thelma started having a violent argument on stage, during which Mama revealed to everyone present the circumstances under which Eunice was conceived. (Mama: ''\"If your daddy hadn't gotten me as drunk as you are now, you never would have been!\"'') Such a statement might explain the rancor between Thelma and Eunice. Taking the story to heart, Bubba makes a tearful and heartfelt apology to Thelma, swearing off beer from that point forward, and Thelma, seeing how remorseful Bubba was for the incident, gladly forgives him and lifts his punishment.\n\nThelma's embattled relationship with Eunice was not unlike the somewhat contentious relationship she had with her own mother. In her mind, Thelma's mother had no liking for anything Thelma did. In an episode where she deals with her own austere mother who haunts her for entertaining the idea of selling her brooch, Thelma calls her the same epithet that Eunice sometimes uses on her: \"Old lady\". At the end of the episode, Thelma's mother's haunting ends when Thelma sells the brooch, and then screams at her mother's apparition, ''\"Get the hell out of my life!\"''\n\nThelma has held various jobs in Raytown. She works with Meals on Wheels; had a short stint as Mayor of Raytown, worked at a travel agency (for less than a day), worked at the local grocery store, \"Food Circus\", went to night school and also worked at a fast food restaurant.\n\nOne of Thelma's lifelong dreams is to go to Hawaii. She gets her wish when she appears on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' While Thelma loses the main part of the competition, she does win a Hawaiian vacation as a consolation prize. The next two-part episode features Thelma, Iola, Vint, Naomi and Bubba's adventures in Hawaii.\n\nAs a former president of the Church Ladies League, Thelma has to deal with the ladies of the church, including the gossipy pastor's wife, [[Alberta Meechum]], who brazenly tries to break up Thelma and Iola's friendship by suggesting that Iola run for president of the CLL. (Mrs. Meechum did this because Thelma had helped Alberta's husband spank their grandson, Little Eugene, for causing trouble for the Harpers and for kicking her husband in his sore leg. In her mind, Little Eugene was an angel, and helping to hurt him was a huge \"no-no\".) Neither Thelma nor Iola wins and Thelma's eventual successor is a woman named Lolly Perdue (first played by Doris Hess and later [[Marge Redmond]]), who wins because she was the only person big enough to separate the squabbling Thelma and Iola. Some time later, Lolly is the target of an impeachment attempt by Thelma and Iola, but they end up backing down when they discover Lolly is [[illiterate]]. Thelma also has to contend with Reverend [[Lloyd Meechum]], the man who married Vint and Naomi, although he has no real grudge against her like his wife.. She also babysat their grandson, a little demon named Eugene, with disastrous results.\n\nThelma was known for her somewhat uneasy relations with her neighbors, going back to when Naomi lived next door. Most of her neighbors wouldn't mind seeing her and her entire [[dysfunctional family]] move away and never come back. A large part of this animosity came about during an aborted attempt to knock down the neighborhood and replace it with a landfill. To Thelma's shock, the house she had lived in since she was married had once been a brothel where the town's founder, James A. Ray, died. Thus, it was made a Raytown historical landmark, to mayor [[Alvin Tutweiler]]'s chagrin, and her neighbors ire. They wanted a lot of money to leave that neighborhood and lose Thelma as a neighbor, but it was not to be. Even Iola was irate.\n\n==Post-television show appearances==\n[[File:Thelma Harper.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, 2009]]\nLawrence has resurrected the character of Thelma (still in her late sixties) several times on the game show ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', on stage in her two-woman show, on her talk show in the early 1990s, on the TNN talk show Primetime Country and in the 2008 TV Land Awards, and on numerous comedy tours.\n\nThelma \"wrote\" a book in 2008 entitled ''Mama for President''.<ref name=\"ref9of100\">Harper, Thelma with Vicki Lawrence & Monty Aidem.

(U.S. syndicated game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' on October 2, 2009 playing for charity. She ended up winning $8,000 [[USD]], getting nine out of ten questions correct, and opted not to answer the eleventh question (the bonus question), as missing that question results in a loss of all the player's winnings.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, Thelma was seen once again on Logo's ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]'' as the special comedian in which the contestants had to interact and have a comedic sketch. Later seen out of the Thelma persona, Vicki Lawrence played as a special guest judge to the contestants alongside RuPaul.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-2-season-1-rupauls-all-stars-drag-race/1696401/playlist.jhtml#vid=851720 |title=RuPaul's Drag Race, Eden's World Full Episodes, Reality TV Shows |publisher=LogoTV |date= |accessdate=2013-03-05}}</ref>\n\nOn February 5, 2013, Thelma appeared in a special sketch during ''[[Betty White]]'s 2nd Annual 90th Birthday'' in honor of Betty White.

The sketch has a run time just over two minutes.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n[[MeTV]]'s insertion of ''Mama's Family'' into their 2015\u20132016 schedule also brought with it several new video spots of Vicki Lawrence as Thelma Harper, used for bumpers and promotional commercials on the network.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{The Carol Burnett Show}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Harper, Thelma}}\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1974]]\n[[Category:Mama's Family characters]]\n[[Category:Comedy characters]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelma_Harper"}

It was the Hurricanes' 62nd season of football. The Hurricanes were led by fourth-year head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] and played their home games at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]. They finished the season 12\u20130 overall. They were invited to the [[1988 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] where they defeated [[1987 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], 20-14, to win the school's second national championship.\n\n==Pre-season==\nAfter taking over as head coach in 1984, [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] had a winning record, but some critics questioned whether he could gain a national championship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1985, Miami finished the regular season 10-1, and had a chance to win the national title with Penn State's loss to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. Needing a victory over Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl, Miami jumped out to a 7-0 lead. Tennessee then scored 35 unanswered to derail Miami's title hopes.\n\nIn 1986, Miami achieved a perfect 11-0 regular season record.  Led by [[Heisman Trophy]]-winner [[Vinny Testaverde]], a record breaking offense, and the 5th-ranked defense in the country, #1 Miami was a prohibitive favorite heading into its [[1987 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] matchup against #2 [[1986 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]].  However, Penn State was able to disrupt the Miami passing game and force the Hurricanes into seven turnovers.  Penn State won the national championship with a 14-10 victory over Miami that was sealed when a Testaverde pass from the Penn State 6-yard line was intercepted in the endzone by [[linebacker]] Pete Giftopoulos with 0:18 left in the game.\n\nDespite losing three key players (Testaverde, [[Alonzo Highsmith]], and [[Jerome Brown]]) from the '86 squad who were selected within the first nine picks of the [[1987 NFL Draft]], 1987 was expected to be somewhat of a reloading year for Miami, which began the season ranked 10th in the nation by the AP poll.\n\nBy year's end, the Hurricanes had allowed a mere 125 points. Miami took down six ranked opponents that fall \u2013 including No. 20 Florida, No. 4 FSU, No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 1 Oklahoma. The Canes earned victories by an average of 23.9 points, scoring over 40 points on five different games.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n| rankyear = 1987\n| poll = AP\n| timezone = Eastern\n\n|{{CFB

The October 3 game featured not only high drama, but also an astounding 56 players who would go on to play in the [[National Football League|NFL]].  Miami scored first with a second-quarter field goal, but Florida State, fielding a team many consider to be the best in school history, took control of the game after that.  A 67-yard run by Florida State [[running back]] Sammie Smith was followed by a 1-yard touchdown run from Dayne Williams, giving FSU a 7-3 lead.  A 36-yard field goal from Derek Schmidt pushed the Seminoles' lead to 10-3 at the half.\n\nAfter Schmidt missed a third-quarter field goal wide right, Miami took over, but went three-and-out and was forced to punt.  The ensuing punt by [[Jeff Feagles]] was blocked and returned by Florida State for a touchdown, increasing the Florida State lead to 16-3 (Schmidt missed the extra point).  Miami was forced to punt again, and a big return by FSU's [[Deion Sanders]] put Florida State in position to add another Schmidt field goal to make the score 19-3.\n\nWith Miami having been unable to mount any offense to that point, the Hurricanes looked to be in dire straits late in the third quarter.  Spurred on by an impassioned speech from receiver [[Michael Irvin]], the Hurricanes were able to keep their focus and climbed back into the game when Walsh found a [[streaking]] Melvin Bratton for a 49-yard touchdown.  Miami went for [[two-point conversion|two]], which they converted when Walsh was able to hook up with receiver [[Brian Blades]], trimming the FSU lead to 19-11 heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe final quarter was filled with back-and-forth [[drama]].  Irvin started things off when he was on the receiving end of a 26-yard touchdown pass from Walsh.  With the score now at 19-17, Miami again went for two, which Miami, again, converted, this time on a pass from Walsh to [[Warren Williams (American football)|Warren Williams]].  With the game now tied at 19-19 and its 16-point lead evaporated, Florida State staged a drive of its own, taking the ball down to the Miami 17-yard line before quarterback Danny McManus fumbled the snap, which was recovered by [[Bennie Blades]].  Miami wasted little time in capitalizing on the miscue, as four plays later Walsh hooked up with Irvin for one of the most famous plays in University of Miami history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Walsh walked to the line, read the FSU defense, and called an audible for Irvin, who was appropriately nicknamed \"The Playmaker\" due to his penchant for making big plays.  Walsh took a quick three-step drop and hung the ball up perfectly for Irvin on a fly route.  Irvin was in double coverage, but was able to get behind the coverage, catch the pass, and take it 73-yards for a Miami touchdown.  With 2:22 left to play, Miami led 26-19.\n\nFlorida State would not go meekly, though, as the Seminoles valiantly fought back after taking possession on their own 25-yard line.  Before long, the Seminoles were in the endzone when McManus hit Ronald Lewis on a perfect corner route for 18-yards.  With college football not having [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] at the time, Florida State head coach [[Bobby Bowden]] was faced with a decision: attempt the extra point and settle for a 26-26 tie, or attempt a two-point conversion and go for the win.  Complicating matters was the fact that Schmidt, FSU's kicker, had looked shaky on this day, already missing on a field goal attempt and on an extra point attempt.  Nevertheless, Bowden initially had decided to kick the extra point and settle for the tie, as he had stated{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} when asked before the game what he would if he found himself in this exact predicament.  But after the FSU offense protested and urged their coach to go for the win, Bowden changed his mind and decided to go for the two, betting both FSU's and Miami's national championship hopes on the outcome.  FSU called a pass play.  McManus took the snap, looked for a receiver, and then threw into the right corner of the endzone.

Oklahoma was a dominant force in college football, winning the national championship in 1985 and losing just one game in each of the preceding two years.  Miami, though, had proven to be the thorn in Oklahoma's side, as the Sooners' losses in '85 and '86 had both come at the hands of Miami.  Now, with the national championship on the line, Miami sought to make it three-losses-in-three-years for Oklahoma, and also their first postseason bowl win under Jimmy Johnson after three straight bowl losses, two in which they struggled and lost their chances to win the national championships.  Further fuel for the fire was provided by the growing personal animosity between former Arkansas player Johnson and Oklahoma head coach [[Barry Switzer]], who was also a former Arkansas player.\n\nMiami's vaunted defense set the tone early, forcing the Sooners to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] on their first five possessions.  Meanwhile, Walsh settled into a nice rhythm, putting Miami on the board first with a 30-yard touchdown pass to fullback Melvin Bratton, who caught 9 passes for 102 yards for the game.  Oklahoma got on the board with a second-quarter touchdown to tie things up, but Miami responded with 10 unanswered third quarter points, coming on an Orange Bowl record 56-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by kicker Greg Cox and a 23-yard touchdown pass from Walsh to Irvin.  Oklahoma would add a fourth-quarter touchdown to trim the score to 20-14, but Miami held on for the win and the national championship.  Johnson received a [[Gatorade#The Gatorade shower|Gatorade bath]], which messed his trademark impeccably coiffed hair, and was carried off the field, having finally won \"the big one\" at Miami.\n\nThe Hurricane defense held Oklahoma to just 255 yards of offense, while Walsh's efficient play (18 of 30, 209 yards, 2 touchdowns) paced the Hurricane offense.  Middle linebacker Bernard \"Tiger\" Clark- a backup middle linebacker who was forced to start after starting MLB George Mira Jr. was suspended for failing a drug test- was named the MVP of the Orange Bowl after recording 14 tackles (12 unassisted).\n\nWith the win, Miami completed its first ever undefeated season.  In winning their second national championship, the Canes once again had to go through the nation's top-ranked team at the Orange Bowl, just as they had done in [[1983 Miami Hurricanes football team|1983]].\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n===[[College Football All-America Team|Consensus All-Americans]]===\n*Bennie Blades, FS\n*Daniel Stubbs, LE\n\n===Awards finalists===\n'''Bold''' indicates winners\n*'''Bennie Blades''', FS \u2013 '''[[Jim Thorpe Award]]'''<ref>http://football.about.com/cs/history/a/jimthorpeaward.htm</ref>\n*Daniel Stubbs, LE \u2013 [[Outland Trophy]]\n\n===Jack Harding University of Miami MVP Award===\n*Steve Walsh, QB\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{1987 Miami Hurricanes football navbox}}\n{{Miami Hurricanes football navbox}}\n{{College Football National Champion navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1987 Miami Hurricanes Football Team}}\n[[Category:1987 NCAA Division I-A independents football season|Miami]]\n[[Category:Miami Hurricanes football seasons]]\n[[Category:College football national champions]]\n[[Category:Orange Bowl champion seasons]]\n[[Category:College football undefeated seasons]]\n[[Category:1987 in sports in Florida|Miami Hurricanes football]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American college football season}}\n{{Infobox NCAA team season|sport=football\n  |year=1987\n  |team=Miami Hurricanes\n  |image=Miami Hurricanes logo.svg\n  |image_size=125\n  |conference=Independent\n  |division=\n  |short_conf=\n  |CoachRank=1\n  |APRank=1\n  |record=12\u20130\n  |conf_record=\n  |head_coach=[[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]]\n  |hc_year=4th\n  |off_coach=[[Gary Stevens (American football)|Gary Stevens]]\n  |oc_year=5th\n  |off_scheme=[[Pro-style offense|Pro-style]]\n  |def_coach=[[Dave Wannstedt]]\n  |dc_year=2nd\n  |def_scheme=[[4\u20133 defense|4\u20133]]\n  |stadium=[[Miami Orange Bowl]]<br>(Capacity: 75,500)\n  |champion=Consensus National Champion<br>Orange Bowl champion\n  |bowl=[[1988 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]\n  |bowl_result= W 20\u201314 vs. [[1987 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]]\n}}\n{{1987 Division I-A independents football standings}}\nThe '''1987 Miami Hurricanes football team''' represented the [[University of Miami]] during the [[1987 NCAA Division I-A football season]]. It was the Hurricanes' 62nd season of football. The Hurricanes were led by fourth-year head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] and played their home games at the [[Miami Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]]. They finished the season 12\u20130 overall. They were invited to the [[1988 Orange Bowl|Orange Bowl]] where they defeated [[1987 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], 20-14, to win the school's second national championship.\n\n==Pre-season==\nAfter taking over as head coach in 1984, [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] had a winning record, but some critics questioned whether he could gain a national championship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn 1985, Miami finished the regular season 10-1, and had a chance to win the national title with Penn State's loss to Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl. Needing a victory over Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl, Miami jumped out to a 7-0 lead. Tennessee then scored 35 unanswered to derail Miami's title hopes.\n\nIn 1986, Miami achieved a perfect 11-0 regular season record.  Led by [[Heisman Trophy]]-winner [[Vinny Testaverde]], a record breaking offense, and the 5th-ranked defense in the country, #1 Miami was a prohibitive favorite heading into its [[1987 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]] matchup against #2 [[1986 Penn State Nittany Lions football team|Penn State]].  However, Penn State was able to disrupt the Miami passing game and force the Hurricanes into seven turnovers.  Penn State won the national championship with a 14-10 victory over Miami that was sealed when a Testaverde pass from the Penn State 6-yard line was intercepted in the endzone by [[linebacker]] Pete Giftopoulos with 0:18 left in the game.\n\nDespite losing three key players (Testaverde, [[Alonzo Highsmith]], and [[Jerome Brown]]) from the '86 squad who were selected within the first nine picks of the [[1987 NFL Draft]], 1987 was expected to be somewhat of a reloading year for Miami, which began the season ranked 10th in the nation by the AP poll.\n\nBy year's end, the Hurricanes had allowed a mere 125 points. Miami took down six ranked opponents that fall \u2013 including No. 20 Florida, No. 4 FSU, No. 10 Notre Dame and No. 1 Oklahoma. The Canes earned victories by an average of 23.9 points, scoring over 40 points on five different games.\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n| rankyear = 1987\n| poll = AP\n| timezone = Eastern\n\n|{{CFB

The October 3 game featured not only high drama, but also an astounding 56 players who would go on to play in the [[National Football League|NFL]].  Miami scored first with a second-quarter field goal, but Florida State, fielding a team many consider to be the best in school history, took control of the game after that.  A 67-yard run by Florida State [[running back]] Sammie Smith was followed by a 1-yard touchdown run from Dayne Williams, giving FSU a 7-3 lead.  A 36-yard field goal from Derek Schmidt pushed the Seminoles' lead to 10-3 at the half.\n\nAfter Schmidt missed a third-quarter field goal wide right, Miami took over, but went three-and-out and was forced to punt.  The ensuing punt by [[Jeff Feagles]] was blocked and returned by Florida State for a touchdown, increasing the Florida State lead to 16-3 (Schmidt missed the extra point).  Miami was forced to punt again, and a big return by FSU's [[Deion Sanders]] put Florida State in position to add another Schmidt field goal to make the score 19-3.\n\nWith Miami having been unable to mount any offense to that point, the Hurricanes looked to be in dire straits late in the third quarter.  Spurred on by an impassioned speech from receiver [[Michael Irvin]], the Hurricanes were able to keep their focus and climbed back into the game when Walsh found a [[streaking]] Melvin Bratton for a 49-yard touchdown.  Miami went for [[two-point conversion|two]], which they converted when Walsh was able to hook up with receiver [[Brian Blades]], trimming the FSU lead to 19-11 heading into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe final quarter was filled with back-and-forth [[drama]].  Irvin started things off when he was on the receiving end of a 26-yard touchdown pass from Walsh.  With the score now at 19-17, Miami again went for two, which Miami, again, converted, this time on a pass from Walsh to [[Warren Williams (American football)|Warren Williams]].  With the game now tied at 19-19 and its 16-point lead evaporated, Florida State staged a drive of its own, taking the ball down to the Miami 17-yard line before quarterback Danny McManus fumbled the snap, which was recovered by [[Bennie Blades]].  Miami wasted little time in capitalizing on the miscue, as four plays later Walsh hooked up with Irvin for one of the most famous plays in University of Miami history.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  Walsh walked to the line, read the FSU defense, and called an audible for Irvin, who was appropriately nicknamed \"The Playmaker\" due to his penchant for making big plays.  Walsh took a quick three-step drop and hung the ball up perfectly for Irvin on a fly route.  Irvin was in double coverage, but was able to get behind the coverage, catch the pass, and take it 73-yards for a Miami touchdown.  With 2:22 left to play, Miami led 26-19.\n\nFlorida State would not go meekly, though, as the Seminoles valiantly fought back after taking possession on their own 25-yard line.  Before long, the Seminoles were in the endzone when McManus hit Ronald Lewis on a perfect corner route for 18-yards.  With college football not having [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] at the time, Florida State head coach [[Bobby Bowden]] was faced with a decision: attempt the extra point and settle for a 26-26 tie, or attempt a two-point conversion and go for the win.  Complicating matters was the fact that Schmidt, FSU's kicker, had looked shaky on this day, already missing on a field goal attempt and on an extra point attempt.  Nevertheless, Bowden initially had decided to kick the extra point and settle for the tie, as he had stated{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} when asked before the game what he would if he found himself in this exact predicament.  But after the FSU offense protested and urged their coach to go for the win, Bowden changed his mind and decided to go for the two, betting both FSU's and Miami's national championship hopes on the outcome.  FSU called a pass play.  McManus took the snap, looked for a receiver, and then threw into the right corner of the endzone.  The ball was underthrown and broken up by Miami defensive back Bubba McDowell before it could reach its intended target.  With Miami up 26-25, Florida State attempted an [[onside kick]] on the ensuing kickoff, but Miami recovered the ball with 0:42 left and was able to run out the clock, sealing the Hurricane victory.\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Maryland===\n{{see also|1987 Maryland Terrapins football team}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Miami Hurricanes|Overall record|Last meeting|Result}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 6\u20137\n| 1985\n| '''W''' 29\u201322\n|}\n\nHaving successfully negotiated its brutal early season schedule, Miami won its next four games with ease, beating [[1987 Maryland Terrapins football team|Maryland]] (46-16), [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] (48-10), [[1987 East Carolina Pirates football team|East Carolina]] (41-3), and [[1987 Miami RedHawks football team|Miami (Ohio)]] (54-3).\n\n<ref>{{cite web|title=COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SOUTH; L.S.U.

Oklahoma was a dominant force in college football, winning the national championship in 1985 and losing just one game in each of the preceding two years.  Miami, though, had proven to be the thorn in Oklahoma's side, as the Sooners' losses in '85 and '86 had both come at the hands of Miami.  Now, with the national championship on the line, Miami sought to make it three-losses-in-three-years for Oklahoma, and also their first postseason bowl win under Jimmy Johnson after three straight bowl losses, two in which they struggled and lost their chances to win the national championships.  Further fuel for the fire was provided by the growing personal animosity between former Arkansas player Johnson and Oklahoma head coach [[Barry Switzer]], who was also a former Arkansas player.\n\nMiami's vaunted defense set the tone early, forcing the Sooners to [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]] on their first five possessions.  Meanwhile, Walsh settled into a nice rhythm, putting Miami on the board first with a 30-yard touchdown pass to fullback Melvin Bratton, who caught 9 passes for 102 yards for the game.  Oklahoma got on the board with a second-quarter touchdown to tie things up, but Miami responded with 10 unanswered third quarter points, coming on an Orange Bowl record 56-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] by kicker Greg Cox and a 23-yard touchdown pass from Walsh to Irvin.  Oklahoma would add a fourth-quarter touchdown to trim the score to 20-14, but Miami held on for the win and the national championship.  Johnson received a [[Gatorade#The Gatorade shower|Gatorade bath]], which messed his trademark impeccably coiffed hair, and was carried off the field, having finally won \"the big one\" at Miami.\n\nThe Hurricane defense held Oklahoma to just 255 yards of offense, while Walsh's efficient play (18 of 30, 209 yards, 2 touchdowns) paced the Hurricane offense.  Middle linebacker Bernard \"Tiger\" Clark- a backup middle linebacker who was forced to start after starting MLB George Mira Jr. was suspended for failing a drug test- was named the MVP of the Orange Bowl after recording 14 tackles (12 unassisted).\n\nWith the win, Miami completed its first ever undefeated season.  In winning their second national championship, the Canes once again had to go through the nation's top-ranked team at the Orange Bowl, just as they had done in [[1983 Miami Hurricanes football team|1983]].\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Awards and honors==\n===[[College Football All-America Team|Consensus All-Americans]]===\n*Bennie Blades, FS\n*Daniel Stubbs, LE\n\n===Awards finalists===\n'''Bold''' indicates winners\n*'''Bennie Blades''', FS \u2013 '''[[Jim Thorpe Award]]'''<ref>http://football.about.com/cs/history/a/jimthorpeaward.htm</ref>\n*Daniel Stubbs, LE \u2013 [[Outland Trophy]]\n\n===Jack Harding University of Miami MVP Award===\n*Steve Walsh, QB\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{1987 Miami Hurricanes football navbox}}\n{{Miami Hurricanes football navbox}}\n{{College Football National Champion navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:1987 Miami Hurricanes Football Team}}\n[[Category:1987 NCAA Division I-A independents football season|Miami]]\n[[Category:Miami Hurricanes football seasons]]\n[[Category:College football national champions]]\n[[Category:Orange Bowl champion seasons]]\n[[Category:College football undefeated seasons]]\n[[Category:1987 in sports in Florida|Miami Hurricanes football]]\n", "name_user": "KingSkyLord", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRoster", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_Miami_Hurricanes_football_team"}
