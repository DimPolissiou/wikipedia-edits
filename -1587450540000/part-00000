Wiselius was a witty, [[Voltaire|Voltairian]] spirit with political views far ahead of his time who would end his days writing dramas on Classical themes. ...<ref>Hooft, H.

He was also a poet, historian and superintendent of the police.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nSamuel was born in [[Amsterdam]], the only son of the oil merchant Iperus Wiselius, himself a Patriot and a captain in the [[schutterij|civic guard]], promoted to colonel in May 1787. He grew up on Nieuwezijds Kolk, probably the  oldest spot in the city centre. Samuel studied law and classics on the [[Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam|Athenaeum Illustre]]. In 1786 he travelled to [[Franeker]], and showed his essay on dismissing the local [[militia]] in 1650 to [[Johan Valckenaer]] and [[Theodorus van Kooten]], then progressive professors at the local University.<ref>Limburg Brouwer, P. van (1846) Het leven van Mr S.I. Wiselius, p. 24-5.</ref> Although the article went missing, the friendship remained, when the three took a prominent role in the country's future after the year 1795.\n\nSamuel had to write a new thesis and obtained his doctorate from [[Leiden University|Leiden]] in 1790. He immediately became a lawyer at the Council of Holland, which also served as a court of law. In 1791 Wiselius was the founder of the brotherhood of ''l'Infanterie des Cinq Sabres'' (\"Infantry of the Five Sabres\") at Leiden, a flirtation with [[freemasonry]].<ref>Kluit, M.E. (1953) Cornelis Felix van Maanen tot het herstel der onafhankelijkheid.</ref> ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] had gained great success that year with his masonically-inspired opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]'').  Wiselius moved with his family to Amsterdam in a house at [[Prinsengracht]], across the [[Noorderkerk]]. He had full house in 1793 with three lectures for the society ''Doctrina et Amicitia'' in the [[Kalverstraat]].<ref>Wit, C.H.E. de (1965) De strijd tussen aristocratie en democratie in Nederland 1780-1848, p. 83-93.</ref> Wiselius proclaimed that the [[French Revolution]] signalled a radical new beginning. No longer was it necessary to take heed of the heavy burden of the past, he argued, but the future could be based on development and progress.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_EsKX3r0Mv4C&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=%22samuel+wiselius%22&source=web&ots=eLrE3BXciX&sig=XLBuQ9SknkNFXY-MTcVPAT37PHk Dutch Culture in a European Perspective] by Willem Frijhoff, Marijke Spies, Published 2004\nUitgeverij Van Gorcum {{ISBN|90-232-3964-4}} accessed 28 September 2007</ref>\n\n===Batavian Republic===\n[[File:Wiselius.jpg|thumb|left|[[Physionotrace]] of Wiselius by [[Gilles-Louis Chr\u00e9tien]], probably made in 1797 or 1798 when Wiselius visited Paris for negotiations about Dutch ships (under non-Dutch flags), full of trade goods, which had been impounded by the French. Wiselius was bullied and returned frustrated and empty-handed.]]\n\nWhen French troops had approached the rivers [[River Rhine|Rhine]] and [[River Meuse|Meuse]] in November 1794, the Patriots started to prepare for a revolution and to stockpile weapons. The hiding place was discovered, and Jacobus van Staphorst and [[Cornelis Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff]] had to leave the city to avoid being captured. The society in the Kalverstraat was closed down by the police and Wiselius, the president, had to announce the message to its members. In January 1795 Wiselius and [[Nicolaas van Staphorst]] were part of the revolutionary committee that occupied the townhall. Wiselius stood before the city government in the nearby [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|townhall]] on the [[Dam Square]] to state that the time had arrived for them to resign.<ref>Dunk, H.W. von der (1995) Het gebouw van de Vaderlandsche Soci\u00ebteit. In: Maandblad Amstelodamum, Jrg 82, p. 65-75.</ref> The next morning, the new leaders moved in without much ado and voted [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck]] as their president. [[Stadholder William V]] escaped by boat from the beach near the Hague to England; there were no casualties and it is known as a [[velvet revolution]].\n\nTogether with [[Pieter Paulus]], Wiselius advocated an entirely new order, with more powerful central leadership. He distanced himself clearly from the [[Union of Utrecht]], which in his view was only \"a weak, barely coherent, and in many senses useless treaty violated almost daily\" (''een zwak, weinig samenhangend, veelszins nutteloos en schier dagelijks geschonden tractaat'').<ref>Vles, E.J.

The committee had to come up with a way of dealing with the bankrupt VOC, a symbol of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'s power. The [[Dutch East India Company]] was nationalised, its so-called Outer Chambers in [[Middelburg]], [[Delft]], [[Enkhuizen]] and [[Hoorn]] closed down and its surplus employees dismissed.  In 1798 the Unitarists Wiselius, Von Liebeherr, [[Wybo Fijnje]] and [[Quint Ondaatje]] were involved in the plans of a coup by [[Daendels]]. The French ambassador [[Charles Delacroix]] was willing to help if the Dutch came up with a substantial financial reward.<ref>Hooft, H.

Wiselius was a witty, [[Voltaire|Voltairian]] spirit with political views far ahead of his time who would end his days writing dramas on Classical themes. ...<ref>Hooft, H.

He was also a poet, historian and superintendent of the police.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Early life===\nSamuel was born in [[Amsterdam]], the only son of the oil merchant Iperus Wiselius, himself a Patriot and a captain in the [[schutterij|civic guard]], promoted to colonel in May 1787. He grew up on Nieuwezijds Kolk, probably the  oldest spot in the city centre. Samuel studied law and classics on the [[Athenaeum Illustre of Amsterdam|Athenaeum Illustre]]. In 1786 he travelled to [[Franeker]], and showed his essay on dismissing the local [[militia]] in 1650 to [[Johan Valckenaer]] and [[Theodorus van Kooten]], then progressive professors at the local University.<ref>Limburg Brouwer, P. van (1846) Het leven van Mr S.I. Wiselius, p. 24-5.</ref> Although the article went missing, the friendship remained, when the three took a prominent role in the country's future after the year 1795.\n\nSamuel had to write a new thesis and obtained his doctorate from [[Leiden University|Leiden]] in 1790. He immediately became a lawyer at the Council of Holland, which also served as a court of law. In 1791 Wiselius was the founder of the brotherhood of ''l'Infanterie des Cinq Sabres'' (\"Infantry of the Five Sabres\") at Leiden, a flirtation with [[freemasonry]].<ref>Kluit, M.E. (1953) Cornelis Felix van Maanen tot het herstel der onafhankelijkheid.</ref> ([[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] had gained great success that year with his masonically-inspired opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]'').  Wiselius moved with his family to Amsterdam in a house at [[Prinsengracht]], across the [[Noorderkerk]]. He had full house in 1793 with three lectures for the society ''Doctrina et Amicitia'' in the [[Kalverstraat]].<ref>Wit, C.H.E. de (1965) De strijd tussen aristocratie en democratie in Nederland 1780-1848, p. 83-93.</ref> Wiselius proclaimed that the [[French Revolution]] signalled a radical new beginning. No longer was it necessary to take heed of the heavy burden of the past, he argued, but the future could be based on development and progress.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_EsKX3r0Mv4C&pg=PA59&lpg=PA59&dq=%22samuel+wiselius%22&source=web&ots=eLrE3BXciX&sig=XLBuQ9SknkNFXY-MTcVPAT37PHk Dutch Culture in a European Perspective] by Willem Frijhoff, Marijke Spies, Published 2004\nUitgeverij Van Gorcum {{ISBN|90-232-3964-4}} accessed 28 September 2007</ref>\n\n===Batavian Republic===\n[[File:Wiselius.jpg|thumb|left|[[Physionotrace]] of Wiselius by [[Gilles-Louis Chr\u00e9tien]], probably made in 1798 when Wiselius visited Paris for negotiations about Dutch ships (under non-Dutch flags), full of trade goods, which had been impounded by the French.

The hiding place was discovered, and Jacobus van Staphorst and [[Cornelis Rudolphus Theodorus Krayenhoff]] had to leave the city to avoid being captured. The society in the Kalverstraat was closed down by the police and Wiselius, the president, had to announce the message to its members. In January 1795 Wiselius and [[Nicolaas van Staphorst]] were part of the revolutionary committee that occupied the townhall. Wiselius stood before the city government in the nearby [[Royal Palace (Amsterdam)|townhall]] on the [[Dam Square]] to state that the time had arrived for them to resign.<ref>Dunk, H.W. von der (1995) Het gebouw van de Vaderlandsche Soci\u00ebteit. In: Maandblad Amstelodamum, Jrg 82, p. 65-75.</ref> The next morning, the new leaders moved in without much ado and voted [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck]] as their president. [[Stadholder William V]] escaped by boat from the beach near the Hague to England; there were no casualties and it is known as a [[velvet revolution]].\n\nTogether with [[Pieter Paulus]], Wiselius advocated an entirely new order, with more powerful central leadership. He distanced himself clearly from the [[Union of Utrecht]], which in his view was only \"a weak, barely coherent, and in many senses useless treaty violated almost daily\" (''een zwak, weinig samenhangend, veelszins nutteloos en schier dagelijks geschonden tractaat'').<ref>Vles, E.J.

The committee had to come up with a way of dealing with the bankrupt VOC, a symbol of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'s power. The [[Dutch East India Company]] was nationalised, its so-called Outer Chambers in [[Middelburg]], [[Delft]], [[Enkhuizen]] and [[Hoorn]] closed down and its surplus employees dismissed.  In 1798 the Unitarists Wiselius, Von Liebeherr, [[Wybo Fijnje]] and [[Quint Ondaatje]] were involved in the plans of a coup by [[Daendels]]. The French ambassador [[Charles Delacroix]] was willing to help if the Dutch came up with a substantial financial reward.<ref>Hooft, H.

In addition, Tonner Doll Company Inc. contracts with and designs for many major film studios. They have designed dolls for such contemporary films as ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'', ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', and ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'', as well as classic films, such as ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref>http://www.tonnerdoll.com/</ref>\n\nRobert Tonner has received national and international artistic awards and recognition including a permanent piece at [[The Louvre]] Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris.

Martin Tonner, his father, was a self-educated engineer, and his mother, Virginia, a housewife.  Robert has one older brother, John; his twin brother, David; and a younger sister, Mary.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\">Finnegan, Stephanie. ''The Robert Tonner Story: Dreams and Dolls''.Portfolio Press 2000</ref>\n\nTonner's mother Virginia was plagued with several illnesses throughout her life, including; [[epilepsy]], [[encephalitis]], [[cancer of the kidney]] and [[myasthenia gravis]].  The continual cost of his mother's health-care would lead to very low economic and family stability throughout Tonner's childhood.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\nAs a child, Tonner turned to drawing and television as an escape from the difficult home-situation.  Programs such as ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', as well as many comic book superheroes, such as the members of ''[[The Justice League]]'', would be his greatest inspiration.  At the age of eight, Tonner learned to sew.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\nTonner began his college career as a pre-med major, attending three different universities.  However, in 1973 the struggling student abandoned his goal of becoming a surgeon and decided to pursue his true passion of becoming a fashion designer.  That same year he would attend the [[Parsons School of Design]] in New York City.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\n==Fashion career==\n\nIn 1975, at the age of 23, Tonner was hired as the Personal Assistant to Don Sayres, a designer for Gamut, a sportswear company located in New York City.  After three years with Gamut, Tonner accepted a position with fashion designer [[Bill Blass]] and was later asked to head the Blassport label. In 1983 Tonner launched his personal fashion label, \"Robert Tonner for Tudor Square\". \n\nAfter leaving the fashion industry, Tonner joined the National Institute of American Doll Artists (NIADA). He served as Standards chairman from 1991 to 1995 and was later elected President of NIADA 1995, a post which he held until 1997.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Finnegan, Stephanie. ''The Robert Tonner Story: Dreams and Dolls''. Portfolio Press 2000</ref>\n\nTonner launched Robert Tonner Doll Design (RTDD) in 1991 with his partner, Harris Safier. The first RTDD designs were introduced at the [[American International Toy Fair]] that same year. Backed by past connections within the NIADA and fashion design world, and the aggressive publicizing by Tonner's partner Harris, RTDD saw exponential growth within the first few years. In 2000, RTDD was renamed Tonner Doll Company, Inc.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn 2006, Robert Tonner created the direct-marketing company Wilde Imagination, which built a collectible [[fashion doll]] design business based on Tonner's fictional character Ellowyne Wilde.  Wilde Imagination continues to market direct to the consumer with new collections featuring Evangeline Ghastly and licensed pop-culture dolls based on [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|''The Wizard of Oz'' film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildeimagination.com/ |title=Wilde Imagination |publisher=Wilde Imagination |accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>   \n\nRecently, Tonner has returned to the world of fashion design with the introduction of the Robert Tonner 2010 Spring Collection, which debuted on September 9, 2009, at the Metropolitan Pavilion in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roberttonner.com/index.cfm?page=press |title=Welcome To Robert Tonner |publisher=Roberttonner.com |accessdate=14 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Current activities==\n\nToday, Robert Tonner resides in the Mid-Hudson River Valley town of [[Stone Ridge, New York]] with his family. An avid reader and pop-culture connoisseur, Tonner spends a great deal of time traveling for business.

In addition, Tonner Doll Company Inc. contracts with and designs for many major film studios. They have designed dolls for such contemporary films as ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'', ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', and ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'', as well as classic films, such as ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.<ref>http://www.tonnerdoll.com/</ref>\n\nRobert Tonner has received national and international artistic awards and recognition including a permanent piece at [[The Louvre]] Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris.

Martin Tonner, his father, was a self-educated engineer, and his mother, Virginia, a housewife.  Robert has one older brother, John; his twin brother, David; and a younger sister, Mary.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\">Finnegan, Stephanie. ''The Robert Tonner Story: Dreams and Dolls''.Portfolio Press 2000</ref>\n\nTonner's mother Virginia was plagued with several illnesses throughout her life, including; [[epilepsy]], [[encephalitis]], [[cancer of the kidney]] and [[myasthenia gravis]].  The continual cost of his mother's health-care would lead to very low economic and family stability throughout Tonner's childhood.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\nAs a child, Tonner turned to drawing and television as an escape from the difficult home-situation.  Programs such as ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', as well as many comic book superheroes, such as the members of ''[[The Justice League]]'', would be his greatest inspiration.  At the age of eight, Tonner learned to sew.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\nTonner began his college career as a pre-med major, attending three different universities.  However, in 1973 the struggling student abandoned his goal of becoming a surgeon and decided to pursue his true passion of becoming a fashion designer.  That same year he would attend the [[Parsons School of Design]] in New York City.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\n==Fashion career==\n\nIn 1975, at the age of 23, Tonner was hired as the Personal Assistant to Don Sayres, a designer for Gamut, a sportswear company located in New York City.  After three years with Gamut, Tonner accepted a position with fashion designer [[Bill Blass]] and was later asked to head the Blassport label. In 1983 Tonner launched his personal fashion label, \"Robert Tonner for Tudor Square\". \n\nAfter leaving the fashion industry, Tonner joined the National Institute of American Doll Artists (NIADA). He served as Standards chairman from 1991 to 1995 and was later elected President of NIADA 1995, a post which he held until 1997.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Finnegan, Stephanie. ''The Robert Tonner Story: Dreams and Dolls''. Portfolio Press 2000</ref>\n\nTonner launched Robert Tonner Doll Design (RTDD) in 1991 with his partner, Harris Safier. The first RTDD designs were introduced at the [[American International Toy Fair]] that same year. Backed by past connections within the NIADA and fashion design world, and the aggressive publicizing by Tonner's partner Harris, RTDD saw exponential growth within the first few years. In 2000, RTDD was renamed Tonner Doll Company, Inc.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nIn 2006, Robert Tonner created the direct-marketing company Wilde Imagination, which built a collectible [[fashion doll]] design business based on Tonner's fictional character Ellowyne Wilde.  Wilde Imagination continues to market direct to the consumer with new collections featuring Evangeline Ghastly and licensed pop-culture dolls based on [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|''The Wizard of Oz'' film]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildeimagination.com/ |title=Wilde Imagination |publisher=Wilde Imagination |accessdate=14 February 2010}}</ref>   \n\nRecently, Tonner has returned to the world of fashion design with the introduction of the Robert Tonner 2010 Spring Collection, which debuted on September 9, 2009, at the Metropolitan Pavilion in New York City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roberttonner.com/index.cfm?page=press |title=Welcome To Robert Tonner |publisher=Roberttonner.com |accessdate=14 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Current activities==\n\nToday, Robert Tonner resides in the Mid-Hudson River Valley town of [[Stone Ridge, New York]] with his family.

Rooted in 1960s [[garage rock]], punk bands rejected the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They typically produced short, fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, [[anti-establishment]] lyrics. Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic]]; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through [[independent record label]]s.\n\nThe term \"punk rock\" was first used by American [[Music criticism|rock critics]] in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and certain subsequent acts they perceived as stylistic inheritors. When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976, acts such as [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Patti Smith]], and the [[Ramones]] in New York City; the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] in London; and [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] in Brisbane formed its vanguard. As 1977 approached, punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK. It spawned a [[punk subculture]] expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing and adornment]] (such as deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, safety pins, and bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]].\n\nIn 1977, the influence of the music and subculture became more pervasive, spreading worldwide, especially in England. It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the [[mainstream]]. In the late 1970s, punk experienced a second wave as new acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style. By the early 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres such as [[hardcore punk]] (e.g. [[Minor Threat]]), [[street punk]] (e.g. [[the Exploited]]), and [[anarcho-punk]] (e.g. [[Crass]]) became the predominant modes of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued other musical directions, giving rise to spinoffs such as [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]], and later [[indie pop]], [[alternative rock]], and [[noise rock]]. By the 1990s, punk re-emerged into the mainstream with the success of punk rock and [[pop punk]] bands such as [[Green Day]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Blink-182]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{See also|Punk subculture|List of punk artists and styles}}\n<!-- not combined because a different direction for the reader --><!-- note deorphaning -->\n\n===Philosophy===\nThe first wave of punk rock was \"aggressively modern\" and differed from what came before.<ref name=\"RMB\">Robb (2006), p. xi.</ref> According to [[Ramones]] drummer [[Tommy Ramone]], \"In its initial form, a lot of [1960s] stuff was innovative and exciting.

[[UK pub rock]] from 1972-1975 contributed to the emergence of punk rock by developing a network of small venues, such as pubs, where non-mainstream bands could play.<ref name=\"Laing, Dave 2015. p. 18\">Laing, Dave. ''One Chord Wonders: Power and Meaning in Punk Rock''. PM Press, 2015. p. 18</ref> Pub rock also introduced the idea of [[independent record label]]s, such as [[Stiff Records]], which put out basic, low-cost records.<ref name=\"Laing, Dave 2015. p. 18\"/> Pub rock bands organized their own small venue tours and put out small pressings of their records. In the early days of punk rock, this DIY ethic stood in marked contrast to what those in the scene regarded as the ostentatious musical effects and technological demands of many mainstream rock bands.<ref>Rodel (2004), p. 237; Bennett (2001), pp. 49\u201350.</ref> Musical virtuosity was often looked on with suspicion. According to Holmstrom, punk rock was \"rock and roll by people who didn't have very many skills as musicians but still felt the need to express themselves through music\".<ref name=\"MM\"/> In December 1976, the English [[fanzine]] ''Sideburns'' published a now-famous illustration of three chords, captioned \"This is a chord, this is another, this is a third. Now form a band\".<ref>Savage (1992), pp. 280\u2013281, including reproduction of the original image. Several sources incorrectly ascribe the illustration to the leading fanzine of the London punk scene, ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'' (e.g., Wells [2004], p. 5; Sabin [1999], p. 111). Robb (2006) ascribes it to [[the Stranglers]]' in-house fanzine, ''Strangled'' (p. 311). In fact, ''Strangled'', which only began appearing in 1977, evolved out of ''Sideburns'' (see, e.g., {{cite web|url=http://www.xulucomics.com/strangled.html|title=''Strangled'' |publisher=Xulu Brand Comics|accessdate=2009-03-19}})</ref>\n\nBritish punk rejected contemporary mainstream rock, the broader culture it represented, and their music predecessors: \"No [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]], [[The Beatles|Beatles]] or [[the Rolling Stones]] in 1977\", declared [[the Clash]] song \"1977\".<ref>Harris (2004), p. 202.</ref> 1976, when the punk revolution began in Britain, became a musical and a cultural \"Year Zero\".<ref name=\"Reynolds p4\">Reynolds (2005), p. 4.</ref> As nostalgia was discarded, many in the scene adopted a [[nihilism|nihilistic]] attitude summed up by the [[Sex Pistols]] slogan \"No Future\";<ref name=\"RMB\"/> in the later words of one observer, amid the unemployment and social unrest in 1977, \"punk's nihilistic swagger was the most thrilling thing in England.\"<ref>Jeffries, Stuart. \"A Right Royal Knees-Up\".

Others, such as [[Robert Quine]], lead guitarist of [[the Voidoids]], have employed a wild, \"[[Gonzo journalism|gonzo]]\" attack, a style that stretches back through [[the Velvet Underground]] to the 1950s' recordings of [[Ike Turner]].<ref>Palmer (1992), p. 37.</ref> Bass guitar lines are often uncomplicated; the quintessential approach is a relentless, repetitive \"forced rhythm\",{{sfn|Laing|1985|p=62}} although some punk rock bass players\u2014such as [[Mike Watt]] of [[Minutemen (band)|the Minutemen]] and [[Firehose (band)|Firehose]]\u2014emphasize more technical bass lines. Bassists often use a [[Plectrum|pick]] due to the rapid succession of notes, which makes [[fingerpicking]] impractical. Drums typically sound heavy and dry, and often have a minimal set-up.

Anti-sentimental depictions of relationships and sex are common, as in \"Love Comes in Spurts\", written by [[Richard Hell]] and recorded by him with the Voidoids. [[Anomie]], variously expressed in the poetic terms of Hell's \"[[Blank Generation (song)|Blank Generation]]\" and the bluntness of the Ramones' \"Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue\", is a common theme. Identifying punk with such topics aligns with the view expressed by [[V. Vale]], founder of San Francisco fanzine ''[[RE/Search|Search and Destroy]]'': \"Punk was a total cultural revolt. It was a hardcore confrontation with the black side of history and culture, right-wing imagery, sexual taboos, a delving into it that had never been done before by any generation in such a thorough way\".<ref>Savage (1991), p. 440.

A rivalry developed between adherents of the new sound and the older punk rock crowd. Hardcore, appealing to a younger, more suburban audience, was perceived by some as anti-intellectual, overly violent, and musically limited. In Los Angeles, the opposing factions were often described as \"Hollywood punks\" and \"beach punks\", referring to Hollywood's central position in the original L.A. punk rock scene and to hardcore's popularity in the shoreline communities of [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].<ref>Blush (2001), p. 18; Reynolds (2006), p. 211; Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 217\u201332; Stark (2006), \"Dissolution\" (pp. 91\u201393); see also, [http://flipsidefanzine.com/PortalHome.html \"Round-Table Discussion: Hollywood Vanguard vs. Beach Punks!\"] (Flipsidezine.com article archive).</ref>\n\nAs hardcore became the dominant punk rock style, many bands of the older California punk rock movement split up.<ref>Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 274\u201379.</ref> Across North America, many other first and second wave punk bands also dissolved, while younger musicians inspired by the movement explored new variations on punk. Some early punk bands transformed into hardcore acts. A few, most notably the Ramones, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, continued to pursue the style they had helped create. Crossing the lines between \"classic\" punk, [[post-punk]], and hardcore, San Francisco's [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] was founded in 1979 by former members of Negative Trend and the Sleepers.<ref>See also Reynolds (2005), pp. 208\u201311.</ref> They became \"the reigning kings of American underground rock, for a few years\".<ref>Dougan, John.

Meanwhile, the [[Oi!]] and [[anarcho-punk]] movements were emerging. Musically in the same aggressive vein as American hardcore, they addressed different constituencies with overlapping but distinct anti-establishment messages. As described by Dave Laing, \"The model for self-proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight-to-the-bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash.&nbsp;...

Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as [[the Queers]] and [[Screeching Weasel]], began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like [[Green Day]] and [[the Offspring]], who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as [[the Vandals]] and [[Guttermouth]] developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like [[Dillinger Four]] who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as [[Blink-182]] is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\"<ref>Di Bella, Christine.

Rooted in 1960s [[garage rock]], punk bands rejected the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They typically produced short, fast-paced songs with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, [[anti-establishment]] lyrics. Punk embraces a [[DIY ethic]]; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through [[independent record label]]s.\n\nThe term \"punk rock\" was first used by American [[Music criticism|rock critics]] in the early 1970s to describe 1960s garage bands and certain subsequent acts they perceived as stylistic inheritors. When the movement now bearing the name developed from 1974 to 1976, acts such as [[Television (band)|Television]], [[Patti Smith]], and the [[Ramones]] in New York City; the [[Sex Pistols]], [[the Clash]], and [[The Damned (band)|the Damned]] in London; and [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]] in Brisbane formed its vanguard. As 1977 approached, punk became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK. It spawned a [[punk subculture]] expressing youthful rebellion through distinctive [[Punk fashion|styles of clothing and adornment]] (such as deliberately offensive T-shirts, leather jackets, studded or spiked bands and jewelry, safety pins, and bondage and S&M clothes) and a variety of [[Punk ideologies|anti-authoritarian ideologies]].\n\nIn 1977, the influence of the music and subculture became more pervasive, spreading worldwide, especially in England. It took root in a wide range of local scenes that often rejected affiliation with the [[mainstream]]. In the late 1970s, punk experienced a second wave as new acts that were not active during its formative years adopted the style. By the early 1980s, faster and more aggressive subgenres such as [[hardcore punk]] (e.g. [[Minor Threat]]), [[street punk]] (e.g. [[the Exploited]]), and [[anarcho-punk]] (e.g. [[Crass]]) became the predominant modes of punk rock. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued other musical directions, giving rise to spinoffs such as [[post-punk]], [[new wave music|new wave]], and later [[indie pop]], [[alternative rock]], and [[noise rock]]. By the 1990s, punk re-emerged into the mainstream with the success of punk rock and [[pop punk]] bands such as [[Green Day]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Blink-182]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{See also|Punk subculture|List of punk artists and styles}}\n<!-- not combined because a different direction for the reader --><!-- note deorphaning -->\n\n===Philosophy===\nThe first wave of punk rock was \"aggressively modern\" and differed from what came before.<ref name=\"RMB\">Robb (2006), p. xi.</ref> According to [[Ramones]] drummer [[Tommy Ramone]], \"In its initial form, a lot of [1960s] stuff was innovative and exciting.

[[UK pub rock]] from 1972-1975 contributed to the emergence of punk rock by developing a network of small venues, such as pubs, where non-mainstream bands could play.<ref name=\"Laing, Dave 2015. p. 18\">Laing, Dave. ''One Chord Wonders: Power and Meaning in Punk Rock''.

According to Holmstrom, punk rock was \"rock and roll by people who didn't have very many skills as musicians but still felt the need to express themselves through music\".<ref name=\"MM\"/> In December 1976, the English [[fanzine]] ''Sideburns'' published a now-famous illustration of three chords, captioned \"This is a chord, this is another, this is a third.

Robb (2006) ascribes it to [[the Stranglers]]' in-house fanzine, ''Strangled'' (p. 311).

A rivalry developed between adherents of the new sound and the older punk rock crowd. Hardcore, appealing to a younger, more suburban audience, was perceived by some as anti-intellectual, overly violent, and musically limited. In Los Angeles, the opposing factions were often described as \"Hollywood punks\" and \"beach punks\", referring to Hollywood's central position in the original L.A. punk rock scene and to hardcore's popularity in the shoreline communities of [[South Bay, Los Angeles|South Bay]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].<ref>Blush (2001), p. 18; Reynolds (2006), p. 211; Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 217\u201332; Stark (2006), \"Dissolution\" (pp. 91\u201393); see also, [http://flipsidefanzine.com/PortalHome.html \"Round-Table Discussion: Hollywood Vanguard vs. Beach Punks!\"] (Flipsidezine.com article archive).</ref>\n\nAs hardcore became the dominant punk rock style, many bands of the older California punk rock movement split up.<ref>Spitz and Mullen (2001), pp. 274\u201379.</ref> Across North America, many other first and second wave punk bands also dissolved, while younger musicians inspired by the movement explored new variations on punk. Some early punk bands transformed into hardcore acts. A few, most notably the Ramones, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Johnny Thunders and the Heartbreakers, continued to pursue the style they had helped create. Crossing the lines between \"classic\" punk, [[post-punk]], and hardcore, San Francisco's [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] was founded in 1979 by former members of Negative Trend and the Sleepers.<ref>See also Reynolds (2005), pp. 208\u201311.</ref> They became \"the reigning kings of American underground rock, for a few years\".<ref>Dougan, John.

As described by Dave Laing, \"The model for self-proclaimed punk after 1978 derived from the Ramones via the eight-to-the-bar rhythms most characteristic of the Vibrators and Clash.&nbsp;...

Bands that fused punk with light-hearted pop melodies, such as [[the Queers]] and [[Screeching Weasel]], began appearing around the country, in turn influencing bands like [[Green Day]] and [[the Offspring]], who brought pop punk wide popularity and major record sales. Bands such as [[the Vandals]] and [[Guttermouth]] developed a style blending pop melodies with humorous and offensive lyrics. Eventually, the geographically large Midwest U.S. punk scene, anchored largely in places like Chicago and Minneapolis, would spawn bands like [[Dillinger Four]] who would take a catchy, hooky pop-punk approach and reinfuse it with some of punk's earlier grit and fury, creating a distinctive punk rock sound with a regional tag. This particular substrate still maintains an identity today. The mainstream pop punk of latter-day bands such as [[Blink-182]] is criticized by many punk rock devotees; in critic Christine Di Bella's words, \"It's punk taken to its most accessible point, a point where it barely reflects its lineage at all, except in the three-chord song structures.\"<ref>Di Bella, Christine.

By the 1990s, punk rock was sufficiently ingrained in Western culture that punk trappings were often used to market highly commercial bands as \"rebels\". Marketers capitalized on the style and hipness of punk rock to such an extent that a 1993 ad campaign for an automobile, the [[Subaru Impreza]], claimed that the car was \"like punk rock\".<ref>Klein (2000), p. 300.</ref>\n\nIn 1993, California's [[Green Day]] and [[Bad Religion]] were both signed to major labels.

It was largely built in its present form in the late 13th century by Laurence de Ludlow, on the earlier castle (some of which still survives) founded by its original owners the de Lacy family, from whom it passed to their de Verdun heirs, who retained feudal overlordship of Stokesay until at least 1317. Laurence 'of' Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England, who intended it to form a secure private house and generate income as a commercial estate. Laurence's descendants continued to own the castle until the 16th century, when it passed through various private owners. By the time of the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1641, Stokesay was owned by [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608\u20131697)|William Craven]], the first [[Earl of Craven]] and a supporter of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. After the Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle in June and quickly forced its garrison to surrender. Parliament ordered the property to be [[slighting|slighted]], but only minor damage was done to the walls, allowing Stokesay to continue to be used as a house by the Baldwyn family until the end of the 17th century.\n\nIn the 18th century the Baldwyns rented the castle out for a range of agricultural and manufacturing purposes. It fell into disrepair, and the [[antiquarian]] [[John Britton (antiquary)|John Britton]] noted during his visit in 1813 that it had been \"abandoned to neglect, and rapidly advancing to ruin\". Restoration work was carried out in the 1830s and 1850s by [[William Craven, 2nd Earl of Craven|William Craven]], the second Earl of Craven. In 1869 the Craven estate, now heavily in debt, was sold to the wealthy industrialist [[John Derby Allcroft]] who paid for another round of extensive restoration during the 1870s. Both of these owners attempted to limit any alterations to the existing buildings during their conservation work, which was unusual for this period. The castle became a popular location for tourists and artists, and was formally opened to paying visitors in 1908.\n\nAllcroft's descendants fell into financial difficulties during the early 20th century, however, and it became increasingly difficult for them to cover the costs of maintaining Stokesay. In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of [[English Heritage]], and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s. In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010.\n\nArchitecturally, Stokesay Castle is \"one of the best-preserved medieval fortified manor houses in England\", according to historian Henry Summerson.<ref name=Summerson2012P1>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=1}}</ref> The castle comprises a walled, [[moat]]ed  enclosure, with an entrance way through a 17th-century timber and plaster [[gatehouse]]. Inside, the courtyard faces a stone [[hall]] and [[Solar (room)|solar]] block, protected by two stone towers. The hall features a 13th-century wooden-beamed ceiling, and 17th-century carved figures ornament the gatehouse and the solar. The castle was never intended to be a serious military fortification, but its style was intended to echo the much larger castles being built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in [[North Wales]]. Originally designed as a prestigious, secure, comfortable home, the castle has changed very little since the 13th century, and is a rare, surviving example of a near complete set of medieval buildings. English Heritage has minimised the amount of interpretative material displayed at the property and kept the castle largely unfurnished.\n\n==History==\n\n===13th\u201315th centuries===\n[[File:Stokesay Castle from the west.jpg|thumb|The castle viewed from the west with the south tower to the right]]\n   \nStokesay Castle was largely built in its present form during the 1280s and 1290s in the village of [[Stokesay]] by Laurence of Ludlow, a very wealthy wool merchant.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|pp=25\u201327}}</ref> Stokesay took its name from the Anglo-Saxon word ''stoches'', meaning cattle farm, and the surname of the de Says family, who had held the land from the beginning of the 12th century onwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=25}}</ref> \n\nStokesay was originally owned by the de Lacy family, who had built the first Ludlow Castle within their manor of Stanton Lacy. In Domesday Book, ''Roger de Laci'' is recorded as holding ''Stoches'' of the King in capite.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n44 page 29].</ref> The manor was later held under the de Lacys by members of the de Say family, whose name attached to 'Stoke' created the name - Stokesay - by which it is still known today. In 1241, the then lord of Stokesay, [[Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Walter de Lacy]], Lord of Meath, died. His son Gilbert had predeceased him, so his extensive estates were divided among Walter's granddaughters. One of these, Margery, had married Sir John de Verdun of [[Alton Castle]] in Staffordshire, son of the heiress [[Roesia de Verdun]] and [[Theobald le Botiller, 2nd Chief Butler of Ireland|Theobald le Botiller]]. Margery's share of her grandfather's estates included Stokesay and a moiety of nearby Ludlow, which thereafter were held by the de Verduns. On 1 September 1270, to raise money to pay for going on the [[Eighth Crusade]] with Prince Edward, John de Verdun conveyed a tenancy of his manor of Stokesay to Philip de Whichecote for a term of 3 years,<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=25}}; {{harvnb|La Touche|1899|p=301}}</ref> which was later extended for the term of Philip's life, when it would revert to John de Verdun.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 page 35].</ref> However, John died in 1274 and Stokesay was inherited by his son Theobald I de Verdun.<ref>{{harvnb|La Touche|1899|p=301}}</ref> The Inquisition Post Mortem following John's death revealed that the de Verduns' feofee at Stokesay at the time was Reginald de Grey. In the feodaries of 1284, Laurence de Ludlow is said to ''hold the Vill of Stokesay for one knight's-fee under John de Grey, which John held it under Theobald de Verdun, who held of the King''.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 pages 34-37]].</ref> \n\nIt appears that in 1317, Stokesay was still being held by the Ludlows under the de Verduns. This is shown by the Inquest Post Mortem of Theobald II de Verdun (son of Theobald I de Verdun), taken in March of that year, which ''gives the Heirs of Sir William de Lodlowe as holding of the deceased a knight's-fee in Southstoke'' ('north Stoke' was one of the de Verdun's other manors in Shropshire, Stoke-on-Tern).<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Volume V, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n54 page 37]</ref> It was only sometime after this date that Stokesay finally passed entirely into the possession of the Ludlow family. \n\nBy chance there may have been earlier connections between Laurence de Ludlow and the de Verduns, which may add to the context within which he became their tenant. Laurence de Ludlow's wife was Agnes de Audley, daughter of [[James Audley (died 1272)|James de Audley]], Justiciar of Ireland and Sheriff of Staffordshire & Shropshire. James de Audley's family had been tenants and close associates of the de Verdons of Alton. James's father, [[Henry de Audley]] was the son of Adam de Audley and Emma, daughter of Ralph/Radulphus fitzOrm whose niece Alina, daughter of Robert fitzOrm, had married Engenulph de Gresley, one of the de Stafford family whose great grandfather was [[Robert de Stafford]].<ref>Assize Rolls, 12 H. III. (p. 50, Vol. IV, Staff. Hist. Coll.), see [https://archive.org/stream/newcollectionsfo12stafuoft#page/8/mode/2up p.8 Walter Chetwynd's History of Pirehill Hundred], published in 'Collections for a History of Staffordshire', Vol. XXII New Series (1909)</ref> Engenulph and Alina's daughter Hawise de Gresley was Henry de Audley's 2nd cousin; she had married Henry de Verdun, son of [[Bertram de Verdun|Bertram III de Verdun]]. This means that Laurence de Ludlow was related by marriage to cousins of his feudal lord Theobald de Verdun. Laurence's mother-in-law Ela de Audley was the daughter of William II Longesp\u00e9e, whose father [[William Longesp\u00e9e, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William I Longesp\u00e9e]], Earl of Salisbury was the illegitimate son of [[King Henry II of England|Henry II]] by [[Ida de Tosny]], who became the wife of Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk.

It was largely built in its present form in the late 13th century by Laurence de Ludlow, on the earlier castle (some of which still survives) founded by its original owners the de Lacy family, from whom it passed to their de Verdun heirs, who retained feudal overlordship of Stokesay until at least 1317. Laurence 'of' Ludlow was one of the leading wool merchants in England, who intended it to form a secure private house and generate income as a commercial estate. Laurence's descendants continued to own the castle until the 16th century, when it passed through various private owners. By the time of the outbreak of the [[English Civil War]] in 1641, Stokesay was owned by [[William Craven, 1st Earl of Craven (1608\u20131697)|William Craven]], the first [[Earl of Craven]] and a supporter of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. After the Royalist war effort collapsed in 1645, Parliamentary forces besieged the castle in June and quickly forced its garrison to surrender. Parliament ordered the property to be [[slighting|slighted]], but only minor damage was done to the walls, allowing Stokesay to continue to be used as a house by the Baldwyn family until the end of the 17th century.\n\nIn the 18th century the Baldwyns rented the castle out for a range of agricultural and manufacturing purposes. It fell into disrepair, and the [[antiquarian]] [[John Britton (antiquary)|John Britton]] noted during his visit in 1813 that it had been \"abandoned to neglect, and rapidly advancing to ruin\". Restoration work was carried out in the 1830s and 1850s by [[William Craven, 2nd Earl of Craven|William Craven]], the second Earl of Craven. In 1869 the Craven estate, now heavily in debt, was sold to the wealthy industrialist [[John Derby Allcroft]] who paid for another round of extensive restoration during the 1870s. Both of these owners attempted to limit any alterations to the existing buildings during their conservation work, which was unusual for this period. The castle became a popular location for tourists and artists, and was formally opened to paying visitors in 1908.\n\nAllcroft's descendants fell into financial difficulties during the early 20th century, however, and it became increasingly difficult for them to cover the costs of maintaining Stokesay. In 1986 Jewell Magnus-Allcroft finally agreed to place Stokesay Castle into the guardianship of [[English Heritage]], and the castle was left to the organisation on her death in 1992. English Heritage carried out extensive restoration of the castle in the late 1980s. In the 21st century, Stokesay Castle continues to be operated as a tourist attraction, receiving 39,218 visitors in 2010.\n\nArchitecturally, Stokesay Castle is \"one of the best-preserved medieval fortified manor houses in England\", according to historian Henry Summerson.<ref name=Summerson2012P1>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=1}}</ref> The castle comprises a walled, [[moat]]ed  enclosure, with an entrance way through a 17th-century timber and plaster [[gatehouse]]. Inside, the courtyard faces a stone [[hall]] and [[Solar (room)|solar]] block, protected by two stone towers. The hall features a 13th-century wooden-beamed ceiling, and 17th-century carved figures ornament the gatehouse and the solar. The castle was never intended to be a serious military fortification, but its style was intended to echo the much larger castles being built by [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] in [[North Wales]]. Originally designed as a prestigious, secure, comfortable home, the castle has changed very little since the 13th century, and is a rare, surviving example of a near complete set of medieval buildings. English Heritage has minimised the amount of interpretative material displayed at the property and kept the castle largely unfurnished.\n\n==History==\n\n===13th\u201315th centuries===\n[[File:Stokesay Castle from the west.jpg|thumb|The castle viewed from the west with the south tower to the right]]\n   \nStokesay Castle was largely built in its present form during the 1280s and 1290s in the village of [[Stokesay]] by Laurence of Ludlow, a very wealthy wool merchant.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|pp=25\u201327}}</ref> Stokesay took its name from the Anglo-Saxon word ''stoches'', meaning cattle farm, and the surname of the de Says family, who had held the land from the beginning of the 12th century onwards.<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=25}}</ref> \n\nStokesay was originally owned by the de Lacy family, who had built the first Ludlow Castle within their manor of Stanton Lacy. In Domesday Book, ''Roger de Laci'' is recorded as holding ''Stoches'' of the King in capite.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n44 page 29].</ref> The manor was later held under the de Lacys by members of the de Say family, whose name attached to 'Stoke' created the name - Stokesay - by which it is still known today. In 1241, the then lord of Stokesay, [[Walter de Lacy, Lord of Meath|Walter de Lacy]], Lord of Meath, died. His son Gilbert had predeceased him, so his extensive estates were divided among Walter's granddaughters. One of these, Margery, had married Sir John de Verdun of [[Alton Castle]] in Staffordshire, son of the heiress [[Roesia de Verdun]] and [[Theobald le Botiller, 2nd Chief Butler of Ireland|Theobald le Botiller]]. Margery's share of her grandfather's estates included Stokesay and a moiety of nearby Ludlow, which thereafter were held by the de Verduns. On 1 September 1270, to raise money to pay for going on the [[Eighth Crusade]] with Prince Edward, John de Verdun conveyed a tenancy of his manor of Stokesay to Philip de Whichecote for a term of 3 years,<ref>{{harvnb|Summerson|2012|p=25}}; {{harvnb|La Touche|1899|p=301}}</ref> which was later extended for the term of Philip's life, when it would revert to John de Verdun.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 page 35].</ref> However, John died in 1274 and Stokesay was inherited by his son Theobald I de Verdun.<ref>{{harvnb|La Touche|1899|p=301}}</ref> The Inquisition Post Mortem following John's death revealed that the de Verduns' feofee at Stokesay at the time was Reginald de Grey. In the feodaries of 1284, Laurence de Ludlow is said to ''hold the Vill of Stokesay for one knight's-fee under John de Grey, which John held it under Theobald de Verdun, who held of the King''.<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Vol. V, MDCCCLVII, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n50 pages 34-37]].</ref> \n\nIt appears that in 1317, Stokesay was still being held by the Ludlows under the de Verduns. This is shown by the Inquest Post Mortem of Theobald II de Verdun (son of Theobald I de Verdun), taken in March of that year, which ''gives the Heirs of Sir William de Lodlowe as holding of the deceased a knight's-fee in Southstoke'' ('north Stoke' was one of the de Verdun's other manors in Shropshire, Stoke-on-Tern).<ref>Eyton's Antiquities of Shropshire, Volume V, [https://archive.org/details/antiquitiesshro09eytogoog/page/n54 page 37]</ref> It was only sometime after this date that Stokesay finally passed entirely into the possession of the Ludlow family. \n\nBy chance there may have been earlier connections between Laurence de Ludlow and the de Verduns, which may add to the context within which he became their tenant. Laurence de Ludlow's wife was Agnes de Audley, daughter of [[James Audley (died 1272)|James de Audley]], Justiciar of Ireland and Sheriff of Staffordshire & Shropshire. James de Audley's family had been tenants and close associates of the de Verdons of Alton. James's father, [[Henry de Audley]] was the son of Adam de Audley and Emma, daughter of Ralph/Radulphus fitzOrm whose niece Alina, daughter of Robert fitzOrm, had married Engenulph de Gresley, one of the de Stafford family whose great grandfather was [[Robert de Stafford]].<ref>Assize Rolls, 12 H.

Coll.), see [https://archive.org/stream/newcollectionsfo12stafuoft#page/8/mode/2up p.8 Walter Chetwynd's History of Pirehill Hundred], published in 'Collections for a History of Staffordshire', Vol. XXII New Series (1909)</ref> Engenulph and Alina's daughter Hawise de Gresley was Henry de Audley's 2nd cousin; she had married Henry de Verdun, son of [[Bertram de Verdun|Bertram III de Verdun]]. This means that Laurence de Ludlow was related by marriage to cousins of his feudal lord Theobald de Verdun.

[[R. W.

The council prohibited marriage, [[concubinage]], and drunkenness to all those in holy orders,{{sfnp|Partner|1973|pp=467\u2013475, 468}} condemned [[sodomy]]{{sfnp|Boswell|1980|p=215}} and [[simony]],{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} and regulated [[vestments|clerical dress]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} Anselm also obtained a resolution against the [[Slavery in the British Isles|British slave trade]].{{sfnp|Crawley|1910}} Henry supported Anselm's reforms and his authority over the English church, but continued to assert his own authority over Anselm. Upon their return, the three bishops he had dispatched on his second delegation to the pope claimed\u2014in defiance of Paschal's sealed letter to Anselm, his public acts, and the testimony of the two monks who had accompanied them\u2014that the pontiff had been receptive to Henry's counsel and secretly approved of Anselm's submission to the crown.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA489 489\u201391]}} In 1103, then, Anselm consented to journey himself to Rome, along with the king's envoy [[William Warelwast]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=71}} Anselm supposedly travelled in order to argue the king's case for a dispensation{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 74]}} but, in response to this third mission, Paschal fully excommunicated the bishops who had accepted investment from Henry, though sparing the king himself.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}\n\n====Second exile====\nAfter this ruling, Anselm received a letter forbidding his return and withdrew to Lyon to await Paschal's response.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} On 26 March 1105, Paschal again excommunicated prelates who had accepted investment from Henry and the advisors responsible, this time including [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], Henry's chief advisor.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=74}} He further finally threatened Henry with the same;{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|pp=19\u201320}} in April, Anselm sent messages to the king directly{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA496 496\u201397]}} and through his sister [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]] expressing his own willingness to excommunicate Henry.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} This was probably a negotiation tactic{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=75}} but it came at a critical period in Henry's reign{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} and it worked: a meeting was arranged and a compromise concluded at [[L'Aigle]] on 22 July 1105.

Henry was forced to make further concessions. He restored to Canterbury all the churches that had been seized by William or during Anselm's exile, promising that nothing more would be taken from them and even providing Anselm with a security payment.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Henry had initially taxed married clergy and, when their situation had been outlawed, had made up the lost revenue by controversially extending the tax over all churchmen.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=297}} He now agreed that any prelate who had paid this would be exempt from taxation for three years.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} These compromises on Henry's part strengthened the rights of the Church against the king.

Atonement for humanity, however, could only be made through the figure of [[Jesus]], as a sinless being both fully divine and fully human.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=\u00a77}} Taking it upon himself to offer his own life on our behalf, his crucifixion accrues infinite worth, more than redeeming mankind and permitting it to enjoy a just will in accord with its intended nature.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=\u00a74.3}} This interpretation is notable for permitting divine justice and mercy to be entirely compatible{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006}} and has exercised immense influence over church doctrine,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}}{{sfnp|Foley|1909}} largely supplanting the earlier theory developed by [[Origen]] and [[Gregory of Nyssa]]{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 74]}} that had focused primarily on [[Satan]]'s power over [[Fall of Man|fallen man]].{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} {{lang|la|Cur Deus Homo}} is often accounted Anselm's greatest work,{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 74]}} but the legalist and amoral nature of the argument, along with its neglect of the individuals actually being redeemed, has been criticized both by comparison with the treatment by [[Abelard]]{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}} and for its subsequent development in [[Protestant Christianity|Protestant]] theology.{{sfnp|Foley|1909|pp=256\u20137}}\n\n[[File:XII c.

The first is that it was proper that Mary should be so pure that\u2014apart from God\u2014no purer being could be imagined. The second was his treatment of original sin. Earlier theologians had held that it was transmitted from generation to generation by the sinful nature of [[sexual intercourse|sex]]. As in his earlier works, Anselm instead held that [[Adam]]'s sin was borne by his descendants through the change in human nature which occurred during the Fall. Parents were unable to establish a just nature in their children which they had never had themselves.{{sfnp|Janaro|2006|p=52}} This would subsequently be addressed in Mary's case by dogma surrounding the circumstances of her own birth.\n\n{{lang|la|De Processione Spiritus Sancti Contra Graecos}} (\"On the Procession of the Holy Spirit Against the Greeks\"),{{sfnp|Forshall|1840|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=qvNfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA74 74]}} written in 1102,{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=\u00a71}} is a recapitulation of Anselm's treatment of the subject at the [[Council of Bari]].{{sfnp|Fortescue|1907|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Gu5d7_bByvIC&pg=PA203 203]}} He discussed the Trinity first by stating that human beings could not know God from Himself but only from analogy. The analogy that he used was the self-consciousness of man. The peculiar double-nature of consciousness, memory, and intelligence represent the relation of the Father to the Son. The mutual love of these two (memory and intelligence), proceeding from the relation they hold to one another, symbolizes the Holy Spirit.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=93}}\n\n{{lang|la|De Concordia Praescientiae et Praedestinationis et Gratiae Dei cum Libero Arbitrio}} (\"On the Harmony of Foreknowledge and Predestination and the Grace of God with Free Choice\") was written from 1107 to 1108.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=\u00a71}} Like the {{lang|la|De Conceptu Virginali}}, it takes the form of a single narrator in a dialogue, offering presumable objections from the other side.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=\u00a73}} Its treatment of free will relies on Anselm's earlier works, but goes into greater detail as to the ways in which there is no actual incompatibility or paradox created by the divine attributes.{{sfnp|Davies & al.|2004|[https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8zGpbpwRhIC&pg=PA201 201]}} In its 5th chapter, Anselm reprises his consideration of [[eternity]] from the ''[[#Monologion|Monologion]]''. \"Although nothing is there except what is present, it is not the temporal present, like ours, but rather the eternal, within which all times altogether are contained. If in a certain way the present time contains every place and all the things that are in any place, likewise, every time is encompassed in the eternal present, and everything that is in any time.\"{{refn|{{harvnb|Anselm of Canterbury|loc=''De Concordia'', p.&nbsp;254}}, translated by [[Greg Sadler|Sadler]].{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=\u00a712}}}} It is an overarching present, all beheld at once by God, thus permitting both his \"foreknowledge\" and genuine free choice on the part of mankind.{{sfnp|Holland|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=o3oNBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT43 43]}}\n\nFragments survive of the work Anselm left unfinished at his death, which would have been a dialogue concerning certain pairs of opposites, including ability/inability, possibility/impossibility, and necessity/freedom.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=\u00a713}} It is thus sometimes cited under the name {{lang|la|De Potestate et Impotentia, Possibilitate et Impossibilitate, Necessitate et Libertate}}.{{sfnp|''PEF''|2000}} Another work, probably left unfinished by Anselm and subsequently revised and expanded, was {{lang|la|De Humanis Moribus per Similitudines}} (\"On Mankind's Morals, Told Through Likenesses\") or {{lang|la|De Similitudinibus}} (\"On Likenesses\").{{sfnp|Dinkova-Bruun|2015|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pA6yCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA85 85]}} A collection of his sayings ({{lang|la|Dicta Anselmi}}) was compiled, probably by the monk Alexander.{{sfnp|''IEP''|2006|loc=\u00a714}} He also composed prayers to various saints.{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA73 73]}}\n\nAnselm wrote nearly 500 surviving letters ({{lang|la|Epistolae}}) to clerics, monks, relatives, and others,{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=361}} the earliest being those written to the Norman monks who followed Lanfranc to England in 1070.{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA73 73]}} [[Richard Southern|Southern]] asserts that all of Anselm's letters \"even the most intimate\" are statements of his religious beliefs, consciously composed so as to be read by many others.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=396}} His long letters to [[Waltram]], [[bishop of Naumburg|bishop]] of [[diocese of Naumburg|Naumberg]] in [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] ({{lang|la|Epistolae ad Walerannum}}) {{lang|la|De Sacrificio Azymi et Fermentati}} (\"On Unleavened and Leavened Sacrifice\") and {{lang|la|De Sacramentis Ecclesiae}} (\"On the Church's Sacraments\") were both written between 1106 and 1107 and are sometimes bound as separate books.{{sfnp|''SEP''|2007|loc=\u00a71}} Although he seldom asked others to pray for him, two of his letters to hermits do so, \"evidence of his belief in their spiritual prowess\".{{sfnp|Hughes-Edwards|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFSuBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA19 19]}} His letters of guidance\u2014one to Hugh, a hermit near [[Caen]], and two to a community of lay nuns\u2014endorse their lives as a refuge from the difficulties of the political world with which Anselm had to contend.{{sfnp|Hughes-Edwards|2012|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=PFSuBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA19 19]}}\n\n[[File:Eadmer of Canterbury Writing - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A 12th-century [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]] of Eadmer composing Anselm's biography]]\nMany of Anselm's letters contain passionate expressions of attachment and affection, often addressed \"to the beloved lover\" ({{lang|la|dilecto dilectori}}).

Henry invited Anselm to return, pledging in his letter to submit himself to the archbishop's counsel.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=63}} The cleric's support of Robert would have caused great trouble but Anselm returned before establishing any other terms than those offered by Henry.{{sfnp|Southern|1990|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=lxf-LvQvvwIC&pg=PA291 291]}} Once in England, Anselm was ordered by Henry to do homage for his Canterbury estates{{sfnp|Hollister|1983|p=120}} and to receive his investiture by [[episcopal ring|ring]] and [[crozier]] anew.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=67}} Despite having done so under William, the bishop now refused to violate [[canon law]]. Henry for his part refused to relinquish a right possessed by his predecessors and even sent an embassy to [[Pope&nbsp;Paschal&nbsp;II]] to present his case.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} Paschal reaffirmed Urban's bans to that mission and the one that followed it.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}\n\nMeanwhile, Anselm publicly supported Henry against the claims and threatened invasion of his brother [[Robert Curthose]]. Anselm wooed wavering barons to the king's cause, emphasizing the religious nature of their oaths and duty of loyalty;{{sfnp|Hollister|2003|pp=137\u2013138}} he supported the deposition of [[Ranulf Flambard]], the disloyal new [[bishop of Durham]];{{sfnp|Hollister|2003|pp=135\u2013136}} and he threatened Robert with excommunication.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} The lack of popular support greeting his invasion near [[Portsmouth]] compelled Robert to accept the [[Treaty of Alton]] instead, renouncing his claims for an annual payment of 3000&nbsp;[[mark (currency)|marks]].\n\nAnselm held a council at [[Lambeth Palace]] which found that Henry's beloved [[Matilda of Scotland|Matilda]] had not technically become a [[nun]] and was thus eligible to wed and become queen.{{sfnp|Hollister|2003|pp=128\u2013129}} On [[Michaelmas]] in 1102, Anselm was finally able to convene a [[Council of London in 1102|general church council at London]], establishing the [[Gregorian Reform]] within England. The council prohibited marriage, [[concubinage]], and drunkenness to all those in holy orders,{{sfnp|Partner|1973|pp=467\u2013475, 468}} condemned [[sodomy]]{{sfnp|Boswell|1980|p=215}} and [[simony]],{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} and regulated [[vestments|clerical dress]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=295}} Anselm also obtained a resolution against the [[Slavery in the British Isles|British slave trade]].{{sfnp|Crawley|1910}} Henry supported Anselm's reforms and his authority over the English church, but continued to assert his own authority over Anselm. Upon their return, the three bishops he had dispatched on his second delegation to the pope claimed\u2014in defiance of Paschal's sealed letter to Anselm, his public acts, and the testimony of the two monks who had accompanied them\u2014that the pontiff had been receptive to Henry's counsel and secretly approved of Anselm's submission to the crown.{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA489 489\u201391]}} In 1103, then, Anselm consented to journey himself to Rome, along with the king's envoy [[William Warelwast]].{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=71}} Anselm supposedly travelled in order to argue the king's case for a dispensation{{sfnp|''ODCC''|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=fUqcAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74 74]}} but, in response to this third mission, Paschal fully excommunicated the bishops who had accepted investment from Henry, though sparing the king himself.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}}\n\n====Second exile====\nAfter this ruling, Anselm received a letter forbidding his return and withdrew to Lyon to await Paschal's response.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} On 26 March 1105, Paschal again excommunicated prelates who had accepted investment from Henry and the advisors responsible, this time including [[Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert de Beaumont]], Henry's chief advisor.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=74}} He further finally threatened Henry with the same;{{sfnp|Charlesworth|2003|pp=19\u201320}} in April, Anselm sent messages to the king directly{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA496 496\u201397]}} and through his sister [[Adela of Normandy|Adela]] expressing his own willingness to excommunicate Henry.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} This was probably a negotiation tactic{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=75}} but it came at a critical period in Henry's reign{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} and it worked: a meeting was arranged and a compromise concluded at [[L'Aigle]] on 22 July 1105. Henry would forsake lay investiture if Anselm obtained Paschal's permission for clerics to do homage for their lands;{{sfnp|Vaughn|1978|p=367}}{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=76}} Henry's bishops'{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=92}} and counselors' excommunications were to be lifted provided they advise him to obey the papacy (Anselm performed this act on his own authority and latter had to answer for it to Paschal);{{sfnp|Vaughn|1978|p=367}} the revenues of Canterbury would be returned to the archbishop; and priests would no longer be permitted to marry.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=76}} Anselm insisted on the agreement's ratification by the pope before he would consent to return to England, but wrote to Paschal in favour of the deal, arguing that Henry's forsaking of lay investiture was a greater victory than the matter of homage.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=77}} On 23 March 1106, Paschal wrote Anselm accepting the terms established at L'Aigle, although both clerics saw this as a temporary compromise and intended to continue pressing for reforms,{{sfnp|''Rambler''|1853|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Xw4AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA497 497\u201398]}} including the ending of homage to lay authorities.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|pp=296\u2013297}}\n\nEven after this, Anselm refused to return to England.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1980|p=80}} Henry travelled to [[Le Bec-Hellouin|Bec]] and met with him on 15 August 1106. Henry was forced to make further concessions. He restored to Canterbury all the churches that had been seized by William or during Anselm's exile, promising that nothing more would be taken from them and even providing Anselm with a security payment.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Henry had initially taxed married clergy and, when their situation had been outlawed, had made up the lost revenue by controversially extending the tax over all churchmen.{{sfnp|Vaughn|1975|p=297}} He now agreed that any prelate who had paid this would be exempt from taxation for three years.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} These compromises on Henry's part strengthened the rights of the Church against the king.
