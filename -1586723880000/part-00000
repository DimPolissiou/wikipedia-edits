Cultural groups had their own preferences and prohibitions. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians developed an intricate transmigration-of-soul theology, which prohibited cremation. This was also widely adopted by Semitic peoples. The Babylonians, according to [[Herodotus]], embalmed their dead. Early [[Persia]]ns practiced cremation, but this became prohibited during the [[Zoroastrian]] Period. [[Phoenicia]]ns practiced both cremation and burial. From the [[Cycladic civilisation]] in 3000 BCE until the Sub-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] era in 1200\u20131100 BCE, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] practiced inhumation. Cremation appeared around the 12th century BCE, constituting a new practice of burial, probably influenced by [[Anatolia]]. Until the Christian era, when inhumation again became the only burial practice, both combustion and inhumation had been practiced, depending on the era and location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ims.forth.gr/joint_projects/e-mem/burial_customs-gr.htm#archaic|title=IMS-FORTH: About IMS|website=Ims.forth.gr|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> [[Roman Empire|Romans]] practiced both, with cremation the rule until the later imperial period.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn Europe, there are traces of cremation dating to the Early [[Bronze Age]] (c. 2000 BCE) in the [[Pannonian Plain]] and along the middle [[Danube]]. The custom became dominant throughout Bronze Age Europe with the [[Urnfield culture]] (from c. 1300 BCE). In the [[Iron Age]], [[inhumation]] again becomes more common, but cremation persisted in the [[Villanovan culture]] and elsewhere. [[Homer]]'s account of [[Patroclus]]' burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a [[tumulus]], similar to Urnfield burials, and qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites. This may be an anachronism, as during Mycenaean times burial was generally preferred, and Homer may have been reflecting the more common use of cremation at the time the Iliad was written, centuries later.\n\n[[File:The Funeral Rites of Auitzotl WDL6755.png|thumbnail|The [[Aztec]] emperor [[Ahuitzotl]] being cremated.

Cremation in India is first attested in the [[Cemetery H culture]] (from c. 1900 BCE), considered the formative stage of [[Vedic civilization]]. The [[Rigveda]] contains a reference to the emerging practice, in [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].15.14, where the forefathers \"both cremated (''agnidagdh\u00e1-'') and uncremated (''\u00e1nagnidagdha-'')\" are invoked.\n\nCremation remained common but not universal, in both [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]].

It then reappeared in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration era, when sacrificed animals were sometimes included with the human bodies on the [[pyre]], and the deceased were dressed in costume and with ornaments for the burning. That custom was also very widespread among the Germanic peoples of the northern continental lands from which the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] migrants are supposed to have been derived, during the same period. These ashes were usually thereafter deposited in a vessel of clay or bronze in an \"urn cemetery\". The custom again died out with the Christian conversion of the Anglo-Saxons or Early English during the 7th century, when Christian burial became general.<ref>S.J.

His furnace operated at a high temperature by using [[Air preheater|regenerative preheating]] of fuel and air for [[combustion]]. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal. Charles's nephew, [[Carl Friedrich von Siemens]] perfected the use of this furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in [[Dresden]]. The radical politician, Sir [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]], took the corpse of his dead wife there to be cremated in 1874. The efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMOuJm345vsC|title=Between Mass Death And Individual Loss: The Place of the Dead in Twentieth-Century Germany|author1=Alon Confino |author2=Paul Betts |author3=Dirk Schumann |year=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=94}}</ref>\n\nThe first crematorium in the Western World opened in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in 1876.

Australians had their first purpose-built modern crematorium and chapel in the [[West Terrace Cemetery]] in the [[South Australia]]n capital of [[Adelaide]] in 1901.

Inside is typically a layer of insulation brick, mostly calcium silicate in nature. Heavy duty cremators are usually designed with two layers of fire bricks inside the insulation layer.

When not pulverised, the bones are collected by the family and stored as one might do with ashes.\n\nThe appearance of cremated remains after grinding is one of the reasons they are called ''ashes'', although a non-technical term sometimes used is \"cremains\",<ref name=Carlson80/><ref name=Sublette/> a [[portmanteau]] of \"cremated\" and \"remains\". (The Cremation Association of North America prefers that the word \"cremains\" not be used for referring to \"human cremated remains\". The reason given is that \"cremains\" is thought to have less connection with the deceased, whereas a loved one's \"cremated remains\" has a more identifiable human connection.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cremationassociation.org/?page=AboutCANA|title=Cremation Association of North America \u2013 About CANA|year=2008|accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref>)\n\nAfter final grinding, the ashes are placed in a container, which can be anything from a simple cardboard box to a decorative [[urn]]. The default container used by most crematoria, when nothing more expensive has been selected, is usually a hinged, snap-locking plastic box.\n\nAn unavoidable consequence of cremation is that a tiny residue of bodily remains is left in the chamber after cremation and mixes with subsequent cremations.\n\n=== Ash weight and composition ===\n[[File:Human cremains.jpg|thumb|Cremated human remains still in plastic bag]]\nCremated remains are mostly dry [[calcium phosphates]] with some minor minerals, such as salts of sodium and potassium. Sulfur and most carbon are driven off as oxidized gases during the process, although about [https://www.zmescience.com/science/physics/cremation-science-memorial-diamonds-052634/ 1% -4% of carbon remain]s as carbonate.\n\nThe ash remaining represents very roughly 3.5% of the body's original mass (2.5% in children). Because the weight of dry bone fragments is so closely connected to skeletal mass, their weight varies greatly from person to person. Because many changes in body composition (such as fat and muscle loss or gain) do not affect the weight of cremated remains, the weight of the remains can be more closely predicted from the person's height and sex (which predicts skeletal weight), than it can be predicted from the person's simple weight.\n\nAshes of adults can be said to weigh from {{cvt|876|to|3784|g|lboz|-1}}, with women's ashes generally weighing below {{cvt|2750|g|lboz|-1}} and men's ashes generally weighing above {{cvt|1887|g|lboz|-1}}.<ref name=\"Warren, M; Maples, W (1997)\">{{cite journal| last=Warren| first=M|author2=Maples, W| title=The anthropometry of contemporary commercial cremation| journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences| volume=42| issue=3| pages=417\u2013423| year=1997| pmid=9144931| doi=10.1520/JFS14141J}}</ref>\n\nNot all that remains is bone.

Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground.) Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous [[scrap metal]]. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as ''gleanings'') are sieved out and may be later interred in common, [[consecrate]]d ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.\n\n== Methods of retaining or disposing of the cremated remains ==\n[[File:US Navy 030501-N-6141B-022 Officers ^ sailors aboard the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Donald Cook (DDG 75).jpg|thumb|A U.S. Navy sailor scatters cremated remains at sea. Visible is the clear plastic inner bag containing the remains, and next to it the labeled black plastic box that contained the inner bag. This is normal in American packaging.]]\nCremated remains are returned to the next of kin in different manners according to custom and country. In the United States, the cremated remains are almost always contained in a thick watertight [[polyethylene]] [[plastic bag]] contained within a hard snap-top rectangular [[plastic container]], which is labeled with a printed paper label. The basic sealed plastic container bag may be contained within a further cardboard box or velvet sack, or they may be contained within an urn if the family had already purchased one. An official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains, and if required by law, the permit for disposition of human remains, which must remain with the cremated remains.\n\nCremated remains can be kept in an [[urn]], stored in a special memorial building ([[columbarium]]), buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field, mountain, or [[Burial at sea|in the sea]]. In addition, there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered in a variety of ways and locations. Some examples are via a helium balloon, through fireworks, shot from shotgun shells, by boat<ref name=\"Scattering Ashes by boat\">{{cite web|title=Scattering Ashes by boat|url=http://www.frenchbrothers.co.uk/private-hire/ashes-scattering|publisher=FrenchBrothersLtd|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> or scattered from an aeroplane. One service sends a lipstick-tube sized sample of the cremated remains into low earth orbit, where they remain for years (but not permanently) before reentering the atmosphere. Some companies<ref>{{cite web |title=Eterneva \u2013 Diamonds from Ashes |url=https://www.eterneva.com/ |website=Eterneva}}</ref> offer a service to turn part of the [[Memorial diamond|cremated remains into synthetic diamonds]] which can then be made into jewelry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/entry/turning-the-dead-into-diamonds-meet-the-ghoul-jewelers_us_57ab1021e4b08c46f0e45afd|title=Turning The Dead into Diamonds: Meet The Ghoul Jewelers of Switzerland|first=Brian|last=Roberts|date=10 August 2016|website=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nCremated remains may also be incorporated, with urn and cement, into part of an artificial reef, or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased. Some individuals use a very small amount of the remains in tattoo ink, for remembrance portraits. Cremated remains can be scattered in national parks in the United States with a special permit. They can also be scattered on private property with the permission of the owner. A portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry, or even blown into special glass keepsakes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solsticeglass.com/solstice-glass-info/faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203122320/http://www.solsticeglass.com/solstice-glass-info/faq.html |archivedate=3 December 2013  }}</ref> and glass orbs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Spirit Pieces Memorial Glass Orbs with Cremation Ashes|url = http://www.spiritpieces.com|website = Spirit Pieces Memorials|accessdate = 4 December 2015}}</ref> The cremated remains may also be entombed. Most cemeteries will grant permission for burial of cremated remains in occupied cemetery plots that have already been purchased or are in use by the families disposing of the cremated remains without any additional charge or oversight.\n\nConcerns have been raised at the amount of ashes scattered at the peak of [[Snowdon]], as they change the nature of the soil, and may affect the ecology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/dont-scatter-ashes-snowdon-2359993|title=(Don't) scatter my ashes on Snowdon|first=Rhodri|last=Clark|date=26 January 2006|website=Walesonline.co.uk|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe final disposition depends on the personal preferences of the deceased as well as their cultural and religious beliefs. Some religions will permit the cremated remains to be sprinkled or retained at home. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, prefer to either bury or entomb the remains. Hinduism obliges the closest male relative (son, grandson, etc.) of the deceased to immerse the cremated remains in the holy river [[Ganges]], preferably at one of the holy cities [[Triveni Sangam]], [[Allahabad]], [[Varanasi]], or [[Haridwar]] in India. The [[Sikhs]] immerse the remains in [[Sutlej]], usually at [[Sri Harkiratpur]]. In southern India, the ashes are immersed in the river [[Kaveri]] at Paschima vahini in [[Srirangapattana]] at a stretch where the river flows from east to west, depicting the life of a human being from sunrise to sunset. In Japan and Taiwan, the remaining bone fragments are given to the family and are used in a burial ritual before final interment.{{further|Japanese funeral|Cremation in Japan}}\n\n==Reasons for choosing cremation==\n[[File:Helsinki-cemetery-mini-gravestones-1841.JPG|thumb|left|Cremation allows for very economical use of cemetery space. Mini-gravestones in [[Helsinki]].]]\nAside from religious reasons (discussed below), some people find they prefer cremation over traditional burial for personal reasons. The thought of a long and slow decomposition process is unappealing to some;<ref name=\"aiken\">{{cite book| last = Aiken| first = Lewis R.| title = Dying, Death, and Bereavement| year = 2000| publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates| isbn = 0-8058-3504-0| pages = 131 }}</ref> many people find that they prefer cremation because it disposes of the body instantly.<ref name=\"sublette-p53\">Sublette & Flagg, p. 53</ref>\n\nOther people view cremation as a way of simplifying their funeral process. These people view a traditional ground burial as an unneeded complication of their funeral process, and thus choose cremation to make their services as simple as possible. Cremation is a more simple disposition method to plan than a burial funeral. This is because with a burial funeral one would have to plan for more transportation services for the body as well as embalming and other body preservation methods. With a burial funeral one will also have to purchase a casket, headstone, grave plot, opening and closing of the grave fee, and mortician fees. Cremation funerals only require planning the transportation of the body to a crematorium, cremation of the body, and a cremation urn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://safepassageurns.com/blogs/blog/5-reasons-why-you-should-choose-cremation|title=5 Reasons Why You Should Choose Cremation|work=Safe Passage Urns|access-date=6 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe cost factor tends to make cremation attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service,<ref name=\"NCRC\">{{cite web|title=Average Cost of Cremation|url=http://cremationresearch.org/average-cost-of-cremation/|website=National Cremation Research Council|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> especially if direct cremation is chosen, in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. However, for some even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially as a lot of fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.\n\nFor surviving kin, cremation is preferred because of simple portability. Survivors relocating to another city or country have the option of transporting the remains of their loved ones with the ultimate goal of being interred or scattered together.\n\nCremated remains can be scattered or buried. Cremation plots or [[columbarium]] niches are usually cheaper than a traditional burial plot or mausoleum crypt, and require less space. Some religions, such as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], require the burial or entombment of cremated remains, but burial of cremated remains may often be accomplished in the burial plot of another person, such as a family member, without any additional cost. This option is charged for in England in an Anglican church where the fee is set by the Table of Parochial Fees (\u00a336 to incumbent and \u00a378 to church council) a total of \u00a3114 in 2010 with a marker charged as extra. It is also very common to scatter the remains in a place the deceased liked\u2014such as the sea, a river, a beach, a park, or mountains, following their last will. This is generally forbidden in public places but easy to do. Some persons choose to have a small part of their ashes (usually less than 1 part in 1000, because of cost constraints) scattered in space (known as [[space burial]] and offered by companies such as [[Elysium Space]], [[Celestis]] and Ascending Memories). Cremated remains can now also be converted to [[diamond]]s.\n\n== Environmental impact ==\nDespite being an obvious source of carbon emissions, cremation also has [[natural environment|environmental]] advantages over burial, depending on local practice. Studies by Elisabeth Keijzer for the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Research found that cremation has less of an environmental impact than a traditional burial ([[natural burial]] was not addressed), while the newer method of [[alkaline hydrolysis (body disposal)|alkaline hydrolysis]] (sometimes called ''green cremation'' or ''resomation'') had less impact than both.

The [[Roman catacombs]] and veneration of [[relics]] of [[saint]]s witness to this preference. For them, the body was not a mere receptacle for a spirit that was the real person, but an integral part of the human person.<ref>Robert Pasnau, in the introduction to his translation of ''Summa Theologiae'', says that Aquinas is \"...quite clear in rejecting the sort of substance dualism proposed by Plato [...] which goes so far as to identify human beings with their souls alone, as if the body were a kind of clothing that we put on,\" and that Aquinas believed that \"we are a composite of soul and body, that a soul all by itself would not be a human being.\" See {{cite book| last = Aquinas| first = St. Thomas| others = trans.

See also Davies & Mates, p. 107-108.</ref> And while there was a clear preference for burial, there was no general Church law forbidding cremation until 1866. Even in [[Medieval Europe]], cremation was practiced in situations where there were multitudes of corpses simultaneously present, such as after a [[battle]], after a [[Epidemic|pestilence]] or [[famine]], and where there was an imminent fear of diseases spreading from the corpses, since individual burials with digging graves would take too long and body decomposition would begin before all the corpses had been interred.\n\nBeginning in the [[Middle Ages]], and even more so in the 18th century and later, rationalists and classicists began to advocate cremation again as a statement denying the resurrection and/or the afterlife,<ref>Prothero, p. 74-75</ref> although the pro-cremation movement more often than not took care to address and refute theological concerns about cremation in their works.<ref name=\"prothero-p74\">Prothero, p. 74.</ref> Sentiment within the Catholic Church against cremation became hardened in the face of the association of cremation with \"professed enemies of God.\"<ref name=\"prothero-p74\" /> When some Masonic groups advocated cremation as a means of rejecting Christian belief in the resurrection, the [[Holy See]] forbade Catholics to practise cremation in 1886. The 1917 Code of Canon Law incorporated this ban, but in 1963, recognizing that, in general, cremation was being sought for practical purposes and not as a denial of bodily resurrection, the choice of cremation was permitted in many circumstances.<ref name=McNamara>[Edward McNamara, \"Mixing Ashes of the Dead\"]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rkdocumenten.nl/rkdocs/index.php?mi=600&doc=4933|title=Piam et constantem \u2013 Over de crematie \u2013 RKDocumenten.nl|website=Rkdocumenten.nl|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> The current [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], states: \"The Church earnestly recommends the pious custom of burial be retained; but it does not forbid cremation, unless this is chosen for reasons which are contrary to Christian teaching.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4A.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1176 \u00a73] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008214742/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4A.HTM |date=8 October 2014 }}; cf.

There is a beautiful symbolism in it.  The whole terminology of eschatology presupposes it.  Cremation is purely heathenish.  It was the practice among the Greeks and Romans.  The mass of the Hindoos thus dispose of their dead.  It is dishonoring to the body, intended for a temple of the Holy Ghost and to bear the image of God.

A family grave can contain urns of many generations and also the urns of spouses and loved ones.\n\n==== Methodism ====\nAn early [[Methodist]] tract titled ''Immortality and Resurrection'' noted that \"burial is the result of a belief in the [[resurrection of the body]], while cremation anticipates its annihilation.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Kelley |first=William|title=The Methodist Review|year=1898|publisher=Methodist Book Concern|location=Cincinnati |page=986}}</ref> ''The Methodist Review'' noted that \"Three thoughts alone would lead us to suppose that the early Christians would have special care for their dead, namely, the essential Jewish origin of the Church; the mode of burial of their founder; and the doctrine of the resurrection of the body, so powerfully urged by the apostles, and so mighty in its influence on the [[primitive Christian]]s.

Cultural groups had their own preferences and prohibitions. The [[ancient Egypt]]ians developed an intricate transmigration-of-soul theology, which prohibited cremation. This was also widely adopted by Semitic peoples. The Babylonians, according to [[Herodotus]], embalmed their dead. Early [[Persia]]ns practiced cremation, but this became prohibited during the [[Zoroastrian]] Period. [[Phoenicia]]ns practiced both cremation and burial. From the [[Cycladic civilisation]] in 3000 BCE until the Sub-[[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] era in 1200\u20131100 BCE, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] practiced inhumation. Cremation appeared around the 12th century BCE, constituting a new practice of burial, probably influenced by [[Anatolia]]. Until the Christian era, when inhumation again became the only burial practice, both combustion and inhumation had been practiced, depending on the era and location.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ims.forth.gr/joint_projects/e-mem/burial_customs-gr.htm#archaic|title=IMS-FORTH: About IMS|website=Ims.forth.gr|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> [[Roman Empire|Romans]] practiced both, with cremation the rule until the later imperial period.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn Europe, there are traces of cremation dating to the Early [[Bronze Age]] (c. 2000 BCE) in the [[Pannonian Plain]] and along the middle [[Danube]]. The custom became dominant throughout Bronze Age Europe with the [[Urnfield culture]] (from c. 1300 BCE). In the [[Iron Age]], [[inhumation]] again becomes more common, but cremation persisted in the [[Villanovan culture]] and elsewhere. [[Homer]]'s account of [[Patroclus]]' burial describes cremation with subsequent burial in a [[tumulus]], similar to Urnfield burials, and qualifying as the earliest description of cremation rites. This may be an anachronism, as during Mycenaean times burial was generally preferred, and Homer may have been reflecting the more common use of cremation at the time the Iliad was written, centuries later.\n\n[[File:The Funeral Rites of Auitzotl WDL6755.png|thumbnail|The [[Aztec]] emperor [[Ahuitzotl]] being cremated.

Cremation in India is first attested in the [[Cemetery H culture]] (from c. 1900 BCE), considered the formative stage of [[Vedic civilization]]. The [[Rigveda]] contains a reference to the emerging practice, in [[Mandala 10|RV 10]].15.14, where the forefathers \"both cremated (''agnidagdh\u00e1-'') and uncremated (''\u00e1nagnidagdha-'')\" are invoked.\n\nCremation remained common but not universal, in both [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome]].

It then reappeared in the 5th and 6th centuries during the migration era, when sacrificed animals were sometimes included with the human bodies on the [[pyre]], and the deceased were dressed in costume and with ornaments for the burning. That custom was also very widespread among the Germanic peoples of the northern continental lands from which the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] migrants are supposed to have been derived, during the same period. These ashes were usually thereafter deposited in a vessel of clay or bronze in an \"urn cemetery\".

His furnace operated at a high temperature by using [[Air preheater|regenerative preheating]] of fuel and air for [[combustion]]. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an open-hearth furnace can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal. Charles's nephew, [[Carl Friedrich von Siemens]] perfected the use of this furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in [[Dresden]]. The radical politician, Sir [[Charles Wentworth Dilke]], took the corpse of his dead wife there to be cremated in 1874. The efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMOuJm345vsC|title=Between Mass Death And Individual Loss: The Place of the Dead in Twentieth-Century Germany|author1=Alon Confino |author2=Paul Betts |author3=Dirk Schumann |year=2013|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=94}}</ref>\n\nThe first crematorium in the Western World opened in [[Milan]], [[Italy]] in 1876.

When not pulverised, the bones are collected by the family and stored as one might do with ashes.\n\nThe appearance of cremated remains after grinding is one of the reasons they are called ''ashes'', although a non-technical term sometimes used is \"cremains\",<ref name=Carlson80/><ref name=Sublette/> a [[portmanteau]] of \"cremated\" and \"remains\". (The Cremation Association of North America prefers that the word \"cremains\" not be used for referring to \"human cremated remains\". The reason given is that \"cremains\" is thought to have less connection with the deceased, whereas a loved one's \"cremated remains\" has a more identifiable human connection.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cremationassociation.org/?page=AboutCANA|title=Cremation Association of North America \u2013 About CANA|year=2008|accessdate=13 November 2008}}</ref>)\n\nAfter final grinding, the ashes are placed in a container, which can be anything from a simple cardboard box to a decorative [[urn]]. The default container used by most crematoria, when nothing more expensive has been selected, is usually a hinged, snap-locking plastic box.\n\nAn unavoidable consequence of cremation is that a tiny residue of bodily remains is left in the chamber after cremation and mixes with subsequent cremations.\n\n=== Ash weight and composition ===\n[[File:Human cremains.jpg|thumb|Cremated human remains still in plastic bag]]\nCremated remains are mostly dry [[calcium phosphates]] with some minor minerals, such as salts of sodium and potassium. Sulfur and most carbon are driven off as oxidized gases during the process, although about [https://www.zmescience.com/science/physics/cremation-science-memorial-diamonds-052634/ 1% -4% of carbon remain]s as carbonate.\n\nThe ash remaining represents very roughly 3.5% of the body's original mass (2.5% in children). Because the weight of dry bone fragments is so closely connected to skeletal mass, their weight varies greatly from person to person. Because many changes in body composition (such as fat and muscle loss or gain) do not affect the weight of cremated remains, the weight of the remains can be more closely predicted from the person's height and sex (which predicts skeletal weight), than it can be predicted from the person's simple weight.\n\nAshes of adults can be said to weigh from {{cvt|876|to|3784|g|lboz|-1}}, with women's ashes generally weighing below {{cvt|2750|g|lboz|-1}} and men's ashes generally weighing above {{cvt|1887|g|lboz|-1}}.<ref name=\"Warren, M; Maples, W (1997)\">{{cite journal| last=Warren| first=M|author2=Maples, W| title=The anthropometry of contemporary commercial cremation| journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences| volume=42| issue=3| pages=417\u2013423| year=1997| pmid=9144931| doi=10.1520/JFS14141J}}</ref>\n\nNot all that remains is bone.

Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground.) Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous [[scrap metal]]. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as ''gleanings'') are sieved out and may be later interred in common, [[consecrate]]d ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.\n\n== Methods of retaining or disposing of the cremated remains ==\n[[File:US Navy 030501-N-6141B-022 Officers ^ sailors aboard the Arleigh Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Donald Cook (DDG 75).jpg|thumb|A U.S. Navy sailor scatters cremated remains at sea. Visible is the clear plastic inner bag containing the remains, and next to it the labeled black plastic box that contained the inner bag. This is normal in American packaging.]]\nCremated remains are returned to the next of kin in different manners according to custom and country. In the United States, the cremated remains are almost always contained in a thick watertight [[polyethylene]] [[plastic bag]] contained within a hard snap-top rectangular [[plastic container]], which is labeled with a printed paper label. The basic sealed plastic container bag may be contained within a further cardboard box or velvet sack, or they may be contained within an urn if the family had already purchased one. An official certificate of cremation prepared under the authority of the crematorium accompanies the remains, and if required by law, the permit for disposition of human remains, which must remain with the cremated remains.\n\nCremated remains can be kept in an [[urn]], stored in a special memorial building ([[columbarium]]), buried in the ground at many locations or sprinkled on a special field, mountain, or [[Burial at sea|in the sea]]. In addition, there are several services in which the cremated remains will be scattered in a variety of ways and locations. Some examples are via a helium balloon, through fireworks, shot from shotgun shells, by boat<ref name=\"Scattering Ashes by boat\">{{cite web|title=Scattering Ashes by boat|url=http://www.frenchbrothers.co.uk/private-hire/ashes-scattering|publisher=FrenchBrothersLtd|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> or scattered from an aeroplane. One service sends a lipstick-tube sized sample of the cremated remains into low earth orbit, where they remain for years (but not permanently) before reentering the atmosphere. Some companies<ref>{{cite web |title=Eterneva \u2013 Diamonds from Ashes |url=https://www.eterneva.com/ |website=Eterneva}}</ref> offer a service to turn part of the [[Memorial diamond|cremated remains into synthetic diamonds]] which can then be made into jewelry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://huffingtonpost.com/entry/turning-the-dead-into-diamonds-meet-the-ghoul-jewelers_us_57ab1021e4b08c46f0e45afd|title=Turning The Dead into Diamonds: Meet The Ghoul Jewelers of Switzerland|first=Brian|last=Roberts|date=10 August 2016|website=Huffingtonpost.com|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nCremated remains may also be incorporated, with urn and cement, into part of an artificial reef, or they can also be mixed into paint and made into a portrait of the deceased. Some individuals use a very small amount of the remains in tattoo ink, for remembrance portraits. Cremated remains can be scattered in national parks in the United States with a special permit. They can also be scattered on private property with the permission of the owner. A portion of the cremated remains may be retained in a specially designed locket known as cremation jewelry, or even blown into special glass keepsakes<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solsticeglass.com/solstice-glass-info/faq.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=28 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203122320/http://www.solsticeglass.com/solstice-glass-info/faq.html |archivedate=3 December 2013  }}</ref> and glass orbs.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Spirit Pieces Memorial Glass Orbs with Cremation Ashes|url = http://www.spiritpieces.com|website = Spirit Pieces Memorials|accessdate = 4 December 2015}}</ref> The cremated remains may also be entombed. Most cemeteries will grant permission for burial of cremated remains in occupied cemetery plots that have already been purchased or are in use by the families disposing of the cremated remains without any additional charge or oversight.\n\nConcerns have been raised at the amount of ashes scattered at the peak of [[Snowdon]], as they change the nature of the soil, and may affect the ecology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/dont-scatter-ashes-snowdon-2359993|title=(Don't) scatter my ashes on Snowdon|first=Rhodri|last=Clark|date=26 January 2006|website=Walesonline.co.uk|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe final disposition depends on the personal preferences of the deceased as well as their cultural and religious beliefs. Some religions will permit the cremated remains to be sprinkled or retained at home. Some religions, such as Roman Catholicism, prefer to either bury or entomb the remains. Hinduism obliges the closest male relative (son, grandson, etc.) of the deceased to immerse the cremated remains in the holy river [[Ganges]], preferably at the holy city of [[Triveni Sangam]], [[Allahabad]], or [[Varanasi]] or [[Haridwar]], India. The [[Sikhs]] immerse the remains in [[Sutlej]], usually at [[Sri Harkiratpur]]. In southern India, the ashes are immersed in the river [[Kaveri]] at Paschima vahini in [[Srirangapattana]] at a stretch where the river flows from east to west, depicting the life of a human being from sunrise to sunset. In Japan and Taiwan, the remaining bone fragments are given to the family and are used in a burial ritual before final interment.{{further|Japanese funeral|Cremation in Japan}}\n\n==Reasons for choosing cremation==\n[[File:Helsinki-cemetery-mini-gravestones-1841.JPG|thumb|left|Cremation allows for very economical use of cemetery space. Mini-gravestones in [[Helsinki]].]]\nAside from religious reasons (discussed below), some people find they prefer cremation over traditional burial for personal reasons. The thought of a long and slow decomposition process is unappealing to some;<ref name=\"aiken\">{{cite book| last = Aiken| first = Lewis R.| title = Dying, Death, and Bereavement| year = 2000| publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates| isbn = 0-8058-3504-0| pages = 131 }}</ref> many people find that they prefer cremation because it disposes of the body instantly.<ref name=\"sublette-p53\">Sublette & Flagg, p. 53</ref>\n\nOther people view cremation as a way of simplifying their funeral process. These people view a traditional ground burial as an unneeded complication of their funeral process, and thus choose cremation to make their services as simple as possible. Cremation is a more simple disposition method to plan than a burial funeral. This is because with a burial funeral one would have to plan for more transportation services for the body as well as embalming and other body preservation methods. With a burial funeral one will also have to purchase a casket, headstone, grave plot, opening and closing of the grave fee, and mortician fees. Cremation funerals only require planning the transportation of the body to a crematorium, cremation of the body, and a cremation urn.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://safepassageurns.com/blogs/blog/5-reasons-why-you-should-choose-cremation|title=5 Reasons Why You Should Choose Cremation|work=Safe Passage Urns|access-date=6 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe cost factor tends to make cremation attractive. Generally speaking, cremation is cheaper than a traditional burial service,<ref name=\"NCRC\">{{cite web|title=Average Cost of Cremation|url=http://cremationresearch.org/average-cost-of-cremation/|website=National Cremation Research Council|accessdate=24 April 2016}}</ref> especially if direct cremation is chosen, in which the body is cremated as soon as legally possible without any sort of services. However, for some even cremation is still relatively expensive, especially as a lot of fuel is required to perform it. Methods to reduce fuel consumption/fuel cost include the use of different fuels (i.e. natural gas or propane, compared to wood) and by using an incinerator (retort) (closed cabin) rather than an open fire.\n\nFor surviving kin, cremation is preferred because of simple portability. Survivors relocating to another city or country have the option of transporting the remains of their loved ones with the ultimate goal of being interred or scattered together.\n\nCremated remains can be scattered or buried. Cremation plots or [[columbarium]] niches are usually cheaper than a traditional burial plot or mausoleum crypt, and require less space. Some religions, such as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], require the burial or entombment of cremated remains, but burial of cremated remains may often be accomplished in the burial plot of another person, such as a family member, without any additional cost. This option is charged for in England in an Anglican church where the fee is set by the Table of Parochial Fees (\u00a336 to incumbent and \u00a378 to church council) a total of \u00a3114 in 2010 with a marker charged as extra. It is also very common to scatter the remains in a place the deceased liked\u2014such as the sea, a river, a beach, a park, or mountains, following their last will. This is generally forbidden in public places but easy to do. Some persons choose to have a small part of their ashes (usually less than 1 part in 1000, because of cost constraints) scattered in space (known as [[space burial]] and offered by companies such as [[Elysium Space]], [[Celestis]] and Ascending Memories). Cremated remains can now also be converted to [[diamond]]s.\n\n== Environmental impact ==\nDespite being an obvious source of carbon emissions, cremation also has [[natural environment|environmental]] advantages over burial, depending on local practice. Studies by Elisabeth Keijzer for the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Research found that cremation has less of an environmental impact than a traditional burial ([[natural burial]] was not addressed), while the newer method of [[alkaline hydrolysis (body disposal)|alkaline hydrolysis]] (sometimes called ''green cremation'' or ''resomation'') had less impact than both. The study was based off Dutch practices; American crematoria are more likely to emit [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], but are less likely to burn hardwood coffins.<ref name=\"bbc-ah\"/> Keijzer's studies also found that a cremation or burial accounts for only about a quarter of a funeral's environmental impact; the carbon emissions of people travelling to the funeral are far greater.<ref name=\"bbc-ah\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/dissolving_the_dead|title=Dissolving the dead: Alkaline hydrolysis, a new alternative to | date=22 May 2017|accessdate=4 January 2020|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nEach cremation requires about {{cvt|28|usgal|L|order=flip}} of fuel and releases about {{cvt|540|lbs|kg|order=flip}} of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus, the roughly 1 million bodies that are cremated annually in the United States produce about {{cvt|270,000|short ton|t|order=flip}} of carbon dioxide, which is more CO<sub>2</sub> pollution than 22,000 average American homes generate in a year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/5/29/11775976/natural-green-burial|title=A different way to die: the story of a natural burial|last=Herzog|first=Katie|date=29 May 2016|work=|access-date=29 May 2016|via=}}</ref> The environmental impact may be reduced by using cremators for longer periods, and not cremating on the same day as the coffin is received, which reduces the use of fossil fuel and hence carbon emissions.

Cremation can also release contaminants, such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] from [[Dental restoration|dental fillings]].<ref name=\"bbc-ah\"/> In some countries such as the United Kingdom, the law now requires that cremators be fitted with abatement equipment (filters) that remove serious pollutants such as mercury.\n\nAnother environmental concern is that traditional burial takes up a great deal of space. In a traditional burial, the body is buried in a casket made from a variety of materials. In the United States, the casket is often placed inside a [[concrete]] vault or liner before burial in the ground. While individually this may not take much room, combined with other burials, it can over time cause serious space concerns.

The [[Roman catacombs]] and veneration of [[relics]] of [[saint]]s witness to this preference. For them, the body was not a mere receptacle for a spirit that was the real person, but an integral part of the human person.<ref>Robert Pasnau, in the introduction to his translation of ''Summa Theologiae'', says that Aquinas is \"...quite clear in rejecting the sort of substance dualism proposed by Plato [...] which goes so far as to identify human beings with their souls alone, as if the body were a kind of clothing that we put on,\" and that Aquinas believed that \"we are a composite of soul and body, that a soul all by itself would not be a human being.\" See {{cite book| last = Aquinas| first = St. Thomas| others = trans.

See also Davies & Mates, p. 107-108.</ref> And while there was a clear preference for burial, there was no general Church law forbidding cremation until 1866. Even in [[Medieval Europe]], cremation was practiced in situations where there were multitudes of corpses simultaneously present, such as after a [[battle]], after a [[Epidemic|pestilence]] or [[famine]], and where there was an imminent fear of diseases spreading from the corpses, since individual burials with digging graves would take too long and body decomposition would begin before all the corpses had been interred.\n\nBeginning in the [[Middle Ages]], and even more so in the 18th century and later, rationalists and classicists began to advocate cremation again as a statement denying the resurrection and/or the afterlife,<ref>Prothero, p. 74-75</ref> although the pro-cremation movement more often than not took care to address and refute theological concerns about cremation in their works.<ref name=\"prothero-p74\">Prothero, p. 74.</ref> Sentiment within the Catholic Church against cremation became hardened in the face of the association of cremation with \"professed enemies of God.\"<ref name=\"prothero-p74\" /> When some Masonic groups advocated cremation as a means of rejecting Christian belief in the resurrection, the [[Holy See]] forbade Catholics to practise cremation in 1886. The 1917 Code of Canon Law incorporated this ban, but in 1963, recognizing that, in general, cremation was being sought for practical purposes and not as a denial of bodily resurrection, the choice of cremation was permitted in many circumstances.<ref name=McNamara>[Edward McNamara, \"Mixing Ashes of the Dead\"]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rkdocumenten.nl/rkdocs/index.php?mi=600&doc=4933|title=Piam et constantem \u2013 Over de crematie \u2013 RKDocumenten.nl|website=Rkdocumenten.nl|accessdate=3 October 2017}}</ref> The current [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], states: \"The Church earnestly recommends the pious custom of burial be retained; but it does not forbid cremation, unless this is chosen for reasons which are contrary to Christian teaching.\"<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4A.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1176 \u00a73] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008214742/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4A.HTM |date=8 October 2014 }}; cf.

There is a beautiful symbolism in it.  The whole terminology of eschatology presupposes it.  Cremation is purely heathenish.  It was the practice among the Greeks and Romans.  The mass of the Hindoos thus dispose of their dead.  It is dishonoring to the body, intended for a temple of the Holy Ghost and to bear the image of God.
