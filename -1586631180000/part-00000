It has the largest database available of contact information on US residents.<ref name=\"VB\"/>\n\nWhitepages was founded in 1997 as a hobby for then-[[Stanford]] student [[Alex Algard]]. It was incorporated in 2000 and received $45 million in funding in 2005. Investors were later bought-out by Algard in 2013. From 2008 to 2013, Whitepages released several mobile apps, a re-design in 2009, the ability for consumers to control their contact information, and other features. From 2010 to 2016, the company shifted away from advertising revenue and began focusing more on selling business services and subscription products.\n\n==History==\nThe idea for Whitepages was conceived by [[Alex Algard]], while studying at [[Stanford]] in 1996.

Explorations such as those of [[Pedro Fages]] and [[Francisco Garc\u00e9s]] sought to extend Catholic influence to the indigenous people and the dominion of the Spanish crown into the area in the 1770s. The [[Serrano Indians|Serrano]] (Mountain-Dwellers) village of '''Guachama''', located just to the west of present-day Redlands, was visited by Fr. [[Francisco Dumetz]] in 1810, and was the reason the site was chosen for a mission outpost. Dumetz reached the village on May 20, the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of [[Saint Bernardino of Siena]], and thus named the region the [[San Bernardino Valley]].<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Robinson\n  | first = W.W.\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = The Story of San Bernardino County\n  | publisher = Title Insurance and Trust Company\n  | year = 1962\n  | location = San Bernardino, California\n  | pages = \n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = }}</ref> The Franciscan friars from [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel|Mission San Gabriel]] established the [[San Bernardino Asistencia]] in 1819 and embarked on the usual program of training the native tribes to raise crops and encouraging permanent settlements. By 1820, a ditch, known as a [[Mill Creek Zanja|''zanja'']], was dug by coerced native labor for the friars from Mill Creek to the Asistencia. In 1822, word of the Mexican triumph in the [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]] reached the inland area, and lands previously claimed by Spain passed to the custody of the [[Mexican government]].\n\nIn 1842, the [[Antonio Maria Lugo|Lugo]] family bought the [[Rancho San Bernardino]] Mexican land grant and this became the first fixed settler civilization in the area. The area northwest of current Redlands, astride the [[Santa Ana River]], would become known as Lugonia. In 1851, the area received its first Anglo inhabitants in the form of several hundred [[Mormon]] pioneers, who purchased the entire ''Rancho San Bernardino'', founded nearby [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], and established a prosperous farming community watered by the many lakes and streams of the [[San Bernardino Mountains]]. The Mormon community left wholesale in 1857, recalled to [[Utah]] by [[Brigham Young]] during the tensions with the federal government that ultimately led to the brief [[Utah War]].

Today only one packing house remains to serve the needs of approximately the {{convert|2500|acre|km2}} of citrus that remains in production in the area.\n\n===Community===\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Redlands was the \"Palm Springs\" of the next century, with roses being planted along many city thoroughfares. Some of these plantings would survive as wild thickets into the 1970s, especially adjacent to orange groves where property management was lax. Washingtonia palms (''Washingtonia robusta'') were planted along many main avenues. So beautifully kept was the area, with the dramatic mountain backdrops, that for several years the Santa Fe Railroad operated excursion trains along the loop that passed through the orange groves of Redlands and [[Mentone, California|Mentone]], across the [[Santa Ana River]], and back into [[San Bernardino]] via East Highlands, Highlands and [[Patton, California|Patton]], and advertised as the \"Kite Route\" due to its multi-sided alignment. The trestle over \"the Wash\" north of Mentone was carried away during a flood in March 1938 and never replaced, the line being truncated there. The Southern Pacific branch line from the [[San Timoteo Canyon]] to [[Crafton, California|Crafton]] was abandoned after the downtown packing house business died. A thru-truss bridge over the ''Zanja'' (locally pronounced \"san-kee\") exists today, abandoned in place. [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]], result of the [[AT&SF]]-[[Burlington Northern]] merger, applied to abandon its San Bernardino-connected branch line east of downtown Redlands in 2007, the last shippers at Crafton and Mentone having ceased operations. A move was made by transit activists beginning in the 1990s to have this branch revitalized as part of the Southern California transit districts, but it came to nothing for many years.  In 2019, (re)construction began on the branch from San Bernardino to end-of-track on the eastern side of town adjacent to the campus of the University of Redlands. When complete, the line will feature 5 stations with mostly local service to and from the San Bernardino Transit Center.\n\nThe city has been visited by three [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]: [[William McKinley]] was the first in 1901, followed by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1903 and [[William Howard Taft]] in 1909. Local landmarks include the [[A.K. Smiley Public Library]], a Moorish-style library built in 1898, and the [[Redlands Bowl]], built in 1930 and home of the oldest continuously free outdoor concert series in the United States. Located behind the Smiley Library is the Lincoln Shrine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshrine.org/|title=The Lincoln Memorial Shrine \u2013 A Lincoln Museum in Redlands, CA|author=|date=|website=www.lincolnshrine.org}}</ref> the only memorial honoring the \"Great Emancipator\", the sixteenth president, west of the [[Mississippi River]].

Explorations such as those of [[Pedro Fages]] and [[Francisco Garc\u00e9s]] sought to extend Catholic influence to the indigenous people and the dominion of the Spanish crown into the area in the 1770s. The [[Serrano Indians|Serrano]] (Mountain-Dwellers) village of '''Guachama''', located just to the west of present-day Redlands, was visited by Fr. [[Francisco Dumetz]] in 1810, and was the reason the site was chosen for a mission outpost. Dumetz reached the village on May 20, the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of [[Saint Bernardino of Siena]], and thus named the region the [[San Bernardino Valley]].<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Robinson\n  | first = W.W.\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = The Story of San Bernardino County\n  | publisher = Title Insurance and Trust Company\n  | year = 1962\n  | location = San Bernardino, California\n  | pages = \n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = }}</ref> The Franciscan friars from [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel|Mission San Gabriel]] established the [[San Bernardino Asistencia]] in 1819 and embarked on the usual program of training the native tribes to raise crops and encouraging permanent settlements. By 1820, a ditch, known as a [[Mill Creek Zanja|''zanja'']], was dug by coerced native labor for the friars from Mill Creek to the Asistencia. In 1822, word of the Mexican triumph in the [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]] reached the inland area, and lands previously claimed by Spain passed to the custody of the [[Mexican government]].\n\nIn 1842, the [[Antonio Maria Lugo|Lugo]] family bought the [[Rancho San Bernardino]] Mexican land grant and this became the first fixed settler civilization in the area. The area northwest of current Redlands, astride the [[Santa Ana River]], would become known as Lugonia. In 1851, the area received its first Anglo inhabitants in the form of several hundred [[Mormon]] pioneers, who purchased the entire ''Rancho San Bernardino'', founded nearby [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], and established a prosperous farming community watered by the many lakes and streams of the [[San Bernardino Mountains]]. The Mormon community left wholesale in 1857, recalled to [[Utah]] by [[Brigham Young]] during the tensions with the federal government that ultimately led to the brief [[Utah War]].

Today only one packing house remains to serve the needs of approximately the {{convert|2500|acre|km2}} of citrus that remains in production in the area.\n\n===Community===\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Redlands was the \"Palm Springs\" of the next century, with roses being planted along many city thoroughfares. Some of these plantings would survive as wild thickets into the 1970s, especially adjacent to orange groves where property management was lax. Washingtonia palms (''Washingtonia robusta'') were planted along many main avenues. So beautifully kept was the area, with the dramatic mountain backdrops, that for several years the Santa Fe Railroad operated excursion trains along the loop that passed through the orange groves of Redlands and [[Mentone, California|Mentone]], across the [[Santa Ana River]], and back into [[San Bernardino]] via East Highlands, Highlands and [[Patton, California|Patton]], and advertised as the \"Kite Route\" due to its multi-sided alignment. The trestle over \"the Wash\" north of Mentone was carried away during a flood in March 1938 and never replaced, the line being truncated there. The Southern Pacific branch line from the [[San Timoteo Canyon]] to [[Crafton, California|Crafton]] was abandoned after the downtown packing house business died. A thru-truss bridge over the ''Zanja'' (locally pronounced \"san-kee\") exists today, abandoned in place. [[Burlington Northern Santa Fe]], result of the [[AT&SF]]-[[Burlington Northern]] merger, applied to abandon its San Bernardino-connected branch line east of downtown Redlands in 2007, the last shippers at Crafton and Mentone having ceased operations. A move was made by transit activists beginning in the 1990s to have this branch revitalized as part of the Southern California transit districts, but it came to nothing for many years.  In 2019, (re)construction began on the branch from San Bernardino to end-of-track on the eastern side of town adjacent to the campus of the University of Redlands. When complete, the line will feature 5 stations with mostly local service to and from the San Bernardino Transit Center.\n\nThe city has been visited by three [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]: [[William McKinley]] was the first in 1901, followed by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in 1903 and [[William Howard Taft]] in 1909. Local landmarks include the [[A.K. Smiley Public Library]], a Moorish-style library built in 1898, and the [[Redlands Bowl]], built in 1930 and home of the oldest continuously free outdoor concert series in the United States. Located behind the Smiley Library is the Lincoln Shrine,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lincolnshrine.org/|title=The Lincoln Memorial Shrine \u2013 A Lincoln Museum in Redlands, CA|author=|date=|website=www.lincolnshrine.org}}</ref> the only memorial honoring the \"Great Emancipator\", the sixteenth president, west of the [[Mississippi River]].

Eventually the Edwards family moved into the structure and occupied it continually until 1958 when Mrs. Edwards died.  Almost a decade later, Plymouth Village acquired the home and used it for their business offices until it was acquired by the Edwards Mansion complex in 1973 for one dollar.
