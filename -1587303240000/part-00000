It was one among the 4 Panchayats sanctioned by [[C. P. Ramaswami Iyer|Sir C.P.Ramaswamy Iyer]] ([[List of Diwans of Travancore|Diwan]]-[[travancore|Thiruvithamcore]]). The others were [[Paravur, Kollam|Paravur]], [[Boothapandi]]  and [[Perumbavoor]].<ref>[http://paravoorsouth.blogspot.in/p/history.html Historic Paravur]</ref> In 1978 Nedumangad Municipality was established.\n\n===Social and Cultural History===\nThe adivasis are the tribal people of the region. From 1677 to 1689 AD, Umayamurani, who ruled Travancore, lost to the battlefield and escaped to [[Koyikkal Palace]], Nedumangad. The queen sought the help of Kerala Varma to defeat the Mukkappappa. History has indicated that Kerala Varma defeated Mukulapada in Thiruvattar and took [[Umayamma Rani]] into [[Trivandrum]]. The arrival of [[Umayamma Rani]]  [[Koyikkal]] headquarters came to this place by the merchants of the merchants, golden tattans and the [[Tamil Brahmins]] who became Puaris. The Tamil Brahmins became the heirs of most land in the area. The palace at Karipur, Pulellunthu Mallan's family head, Karippur Mudipura are the historical findings of the ancient history of Nedumangad. [[Nedumangad Koyikkal palace]] is one of the few buildings built in the shape of the sea in the 15th century Kerala Architectural Architecture. The historic [[Koyikkal Palace]] has been maintained since 1979 by the [[Kerala State Department of Archaeology]]. Nedumangad Street struggle was one of the historical struggles of the national movement during Independence. The LLA LP School, which started as \"Pallalu school\", is the first school to be established here. The first library of the library is the Guruvayur Vidyalaya. Karimbikkavu Sree DharmaSastha Temple,Mannamkonam Sree Bhagavathy Temple,Indalayappan Temple, Ardhanarisheshwara Temple, Muthumariamman Temple, Melamcode Temple, Mutharamman Temple, Pathadavu, Pazhavadi Ganapati Temple, Paranthokha Bhagwati Temple, Nedumangad Town Muslim jamaath Complex and the Christian Church are some of the oldest shrines of the region. Nedumangad's commercial history is concerned with agriculture. Nedumangad Public Market is the largest market in the district of [[Thiruvananthapuram]]. It is the largest market for the hill stations and agricultural commodities. The Agrarian Sales Complex, with the help of the Department of Agriculture is set up with the help of the European Economic Community. [[Thiruvananthapuram - Chenkotta]]  ([[State Highway 2 (Kerala)|State Highway 2]]) and Shorlakode - Nedumangad State Highway   ([[State Highway 3 (Kerala)|SH 3]])  is one of the most important interstate routes through Nedumangad. The main road that passes through [[Ponmudi]] is the main road that passes through Nedumangad. The distance from Nedumangad to the capital city is only 18&nbsp;km. In the state of [[Kerala]], the first of its kind in the state of Kerala was started by the Folklore Museum and the Museum of Numismatics at [[Nedumangad Koyikkal Palace]] on 27 March 1992. The [[Koyikkal Palace]] is located next to the municipal office. The museum is located in Coimbatore and is under the control of Government of Kerala. Nedumangad is also a place on the journey to the [[Ponmudi]] hill resort. PSLV, a subsidiary of [[ISRO]] and [[VSSC]] The project is located at Nedumangad, [[Valiyamala]].

It is similar to [[Selective laser melting|Selective Laser Melting]] (SLM); the two are instantiations of the same concept but differ in technical details. [[Selective laser melting]] (SLM) uses a comparable concept, but in SLM the material is fully melted rather than sintered, allowing different properties ([[crystal structure]], [[porosity]], and so on). SLS (as well as the other mentioned AM techniques) is a relatively new technology that so far has mainly been used for [[rapid prototyping]] and for [[Job production|low-volume production]] of component parts. Production roles are expanding as the [[commercialization]] of AM technology improves.\n\n==History==\nSelective laser sintering (SLS) was developed and patented by Dr. [[Carl R. Deckard|Carl Deckard]] and academic adviser, Dr. [[Joe Beaman]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in the mid-1980s, under sponsorship of [[DARPA]].<ref>Deckard, C., \"Method and apparatus for producing parts by selective sintering\", {{US patent|4863538}}, filed October 17, 1986, published September 5, 1989.</ref> Deckard and Beaman were involved in the resulting start up company DTM, established to design and build the SLS machines. In 2001, 3D Systems, the biggest competitor to DTM and SLS technology, acquired DTM.<ref>Lou, Alex and Grosvenor, Carol \"[http://www.me.utexas.edu/news/2012/0712_sls_history.php#ch4 Selective Laser Sintering, Birth of an Industry]\", ''The University of Texas'', December 07, 2012. Retrieved on March 22, 2013.</ref> The most recent patent regarding Deckard's SLS technology was issued 28 January 1997 and expired 28 Jan 2014.<ref>[https://www.google.com/patents/US5597589?dq=US5597589&hl=en&sa=X&ei=XG3qUnbC-qAE056C0AQ&ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA US5597589]</ref>\n\nA similar process was patented without being commercialized by R. F. Housholder in 1979.<ref>Housholder, R., \"Molding Process\", {{US patent|4247508}}, filed December 3, 1979, published January 27, 1981.</ref>\n\nAs SLS requires the use of high-powered lasers it is often too expensive, not to mention possibly too dangerous, to use in the home. The expense and potential danger of SLS printing means that the home market for SLS printing is not as large as the market for other additive manufacturing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM).\n\n==Technology==\nAn additive manufacturing layer technology, SLS involves the use of a high power [[laser]] (for example, a [[carbon dioxide laser]]) to fuse small particles of [[plastic]], [[metal]], [[ceramic]], or [[glass]] powders into a mass that has a desired three-dimensional shape. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part (for example from a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] file or scan data) on the surface of a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the part is completed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/340051/Design_Guides/Xometry_DesignGuide_SLS.pdf|title=Design Guide: Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)|last=|first=|date=|website=Xometry|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:SLS_schematic.svg|center|780px|thumb|\nSelective laser sintering process<br/>\n'''1''' Laser '''2''' Scanner system '''3''' Powder delivery system '''4''' Powder delivery piston '''5''' Roller '''6''' Fabrication piston '''7''' Fabrication powder bed '''8''' Object being fabricated (see inset)\n\n'''A''' Laser scanning direction '''B''' Sintered powder particles (brown state) '''C''' Laser beam '''D''' Laser sintering '''E''' Pre-placed powder bed (green state) '''F''' Unsintered material in previous layers\n]]\n\nBecause finished part density depends on peak laser power, rather than laser duration, a SLS machine typically uses a [[pulsed laser]]. The SLS machine preheats the bulk powder material in the powder bed somewhat below its melting point, to make it easier for the laser to raise the temperature of the selected regions the rest of the way to the melting point.<ref name=\"Yarlagadda\">{{cite book|author1=Prasad K. D. V. Yarlagadda|author2=S. Narayanan|title=GCMM 2004: 1st International Conference on Manufacturing and Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v4Tm1of3UEcC&pg=PA73|accessdate=18 June 2011|date=February 2005|publisher=Alpha Science Int'l |isbn=978-81-7319-677-5|pages=73\u2013}}\n</ref>\n\nIn contrast with some other additive manufacturing processes, such as [[stereolithography]] (SLA) and [[fused deposition modeling]] (FDM), which most often require special support structures to fabricate overhanging designs, SLS does not need a separate feeder for support material because the part being constructed is surrounded by unsintered powder at all times, this allows for the construction of previously impossible geometries.

It is similar to [[Selective laser melting|Selective Laser Melting]] (SLM); the two are instantiations of the same concept but differ in technical details. [[Selective laser melting]] (SLM) uses a comparable concept, but in SLM the material is fully melted rather than sintered, allowing different properties ([[crystal structure]], [[porosity]], and so on). SLS (as well as the other mentioned AM techniques) is a relatively new technology that so far has mainly been used for [[rapid prototyping]] and for [[Job production|low-volume production]] of component parts. Production roles are expanding as the [[commercialization]] of AM technology improves.\n\n==History==\nSelective laser sintering (SLS) was developed and patented by Dr. [[Carl R. Deckard|Carl Deckard]] and academic adviser, Dr. [[Joe Beaman]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in the mid-1980s, under sponsorship of [[DARPA]].<ref>Deckard, C., \"Method and apparatus for producing parts by selective sintering\", {{US patent|4863538}}, filed October 17, 1986, published September 5, 1989.</ref> Deckard and Beaman were involved in the resulting start up company DTM, established to design and build the SLS machines. In 2001, 3D Systems, the biggest competitor to DTM and SLS technology, acquired DTM.<ref>Lou, Alex and Grosvenor, Carol \"[http://www.me.utexas.edu/news/2012/0712_sls_history.php#ch4 Selective Laser Sintering, Birth of an Industry]\", ''The University of Texas'', December 07, 2012.

F. Housholder in 1979.<ref>Housholder, R., \"Molding Process\", {{US patent|4247508}}, filed December 3, 1979, published January 27, 1981.</ref>\n\nAs SLS requires the use of high-powered lasers it is often too expensive, not to mention possibly too dangerous, to use in the home. The expense and potential danger of SLS printing means that the home market for SLS printing is not as large as the market for other additive manufacturing technologies, such as Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM).\n\n==Technology==\nAn additive manufacturing layer technology, SLS involves the use of a high power [[laser]] (for example, a [[carbon dioxide laser]]) to fuse small particles of [[plastic]], [[metal]], [[ceramic]], or [[glass]] powders into a mass that has a desired three-dimensional shape. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part (for example from a [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] file or scan data) on the surface of a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the part is completed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/340051/Design_Guides/Xometry_DesignGuide_SLS.pdf|title=Design Guide: Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)|last=|first=|date=|website=Xometry|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:SLS_schematic.svg|center|780px|thumb|\nSelective laser sintering process<br/>\n'''1''' Laser '''2''' Scanner system '''3''' Powder delivery system '''4''' Powder delivery piston '''5''' Roller '''6''' Fabrication piston '''7''' Fabrication powder bed '''8''' Object being fabricated (see inset)\n\n'''A''' Laser scanning direction '''B''' Sintered powder particles (brown state) '''C''' Laser beam '''D''' Laser sintering '''E''' Pre-placed powder bed (green state) '''F''' Unsintered material in previous layers\n]]\n\nBecause finished part density depends on peak laser power, rather than laser duration, a SLS machine typically uses a [[pulsed laser]]. The SLS machine preheats the bulk powder material in the powder bed somewhat below its melting point, to make it easier for the laser to raise the temperature of the selected regions the rest of the way to the melting point.<ref name=\"Yarlagadda\">{{cite book|author1=Prasad K.

Also, since the machine's chamber is always filled with powder material the fabrication of multiple parts has a far lower impact on the overall difficulty and price of the design because through a technique known as '[[Nesting (process)|Nesting]]' multiple parts can be positioned to fit within the boundaries of the machine.

As the southern portion of the country, Wallonia is primarily [[Francophone|French-speaking]], and accounts for 55% of Belgium's territory, but only a third of its population. The Walloon Region was not merged with the [[French Community of Belgium]], which is the political entity responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education, because the French Community of Belgium encompasses both Wallonia and the majority French-Speaking [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]]. \n\nThe German-speaking minority in eastern Wallonia results from [[World War I]] and the subsequent annexation of three [[Eupen-Malmedy|cantons]] that were initially part of the former German empire. This community represents less than 1%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/countries/belgium.shtml|title=BBC - Languages - Languages|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> of the Belgian population. It forms the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues.\n\nDuring the industrial revolution, Wallonia was second only to the United Kingdom in industrialization, capitalizing on its extensive deposits of [[coal]] and [[iron]]. This brought the region wealth, and from the beginning of the 19th to the middle of the 20th century, Wallonia was the more prosperous half of Belgium. Since [[World War II]], the importance of heavy industry has greatly diminished, and the [[Flemish Region]] surpassed Wallonia in wealth, as Wallonia declined economically. Wallonia now suffers from high unemployment and has a significantly lower GDP per capita than Flanders. The economic inequalities and linguistic divide between the two are major sources of political conflicts in Belgium and a major factor in [[Flemish separatism]].\n\nThe capital of Wallonia is [[Namur (city)|Namur]], and the most populous city is [[Li\u00e8ge]]. Most of Wallonia's major cities and two-thirds of its population lie along the [[Sambre and Meuse valley]], the former industrial backbone of Belgium. To the north lies the Central Belgian Plateau, which, like Flanders, is relatively flat and agriculturally fertile. In the southeast lie the [[Ardennes]], hilly and sparsely populated. Wallonia borders [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]] ([[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]) in the north, [[France]] ([[Grand Est]] and [[Hauts-de-France]]) to the south and west, and [[Germany]] ([[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]) and [[Luxembourg]] ([[Capellen (canton)|Capellen]], [[Clervaux (canton)|Clervaux]], [[Esch-sur-Alzette (canton)|Esch-sur-Alzette]], [[Redange (canton)|Redange]] and [[Wiltz (canton)|Wiltz]]) to the east. Wallonia has been a member of the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1980.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term \"Wallonia\" can mean slightly different things in different contexts. One of the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|federal regions of Belgium]] is still constitutionally defined as the Walloon Region, but the region's government has renamed it Wallonia, and it is commonly called Wallonia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gouvernement.wallonie.be/identite-wallonne-la-region-wallonne-fait-place-la-wallonie-et-namur-est-sa-capitale-01-04-10|title=French : Le Gouvernement a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de promouvoir le terme \u00ab Wallonie \u00bb en lieu et place de \u00ab R\u00e9gion wallonne \u00bb.|publisher=}}</ref><ref>For example, the [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html CIA World Factbook] states Wallonia is the short form and Walloon Region is the long form.

On Lotharingia's breakup in 959, the present-day territory of Belgium became part of [[Lower Lotharingia]], which then fragmented into rival principalities and duchies by 1190.

After [[World War II]], major strikes included the [[general strike against Leopold III of Belgium]] (1950), and the [[1960-1961 Winter General Strike]] for autonomy for Wallonia.\n\nThe profitability of the heavy industries to which Wallonia owed its prosperity started declining in the first half of the 20th century, and the center of industrial activity shifted north to Flanders. The loss of prosperity caused social unrest, and Wallonia sought greater autonomy in order to address its economic problems. In the wake of the [[1960-1961 Winter General Strike]], the process of [[state reform in Belgium]] got under way. This reform started partly with the [[Language legislation in Belgium|linguistic laws of 1962-63]], which defined the four language areas within the [[Constitution of Belgium|constitution]]. But the strikes of 1960 which took place in Wallonia more than in [[Flanders]] are not principally linked with the four language areas nor with the Communities but with the Regions.  In 1968, the conflict between the communities burst out. The French speakers were driven out of the Leuven campus of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] amid shouts of \"Walen buiten!\" (\"Walloons out!\") and were given a [[Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain|brand new campus]] in the French-speaking area of the province.<ref name=\"RegionAsserts\" /> This led to [[State reform in Belgium]], which resulted in the creation of the Walloon Region and the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]], both of which have considerable autonomy.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Belgium resources 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Coalmining and steelmaking industrial areas in Belgium.  The [[sillon industriel]] is the blue area along the [[Meuse river|Meuse]] and [[Sambre]].]][[File:R\u00e9gions naturelles de Belgique.jpg|thumb|350px|The natural regions of Belgium]]\n\nWallonia is [[landlocked]], with an area of {{convert|16901|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or 55 percent of the total area of Belgium. The [[Sambre and Meuse valley]], from [[Li\u00e8ge]] ({{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}}) to [[Charleroi]] ({{convert|120|m|ft|abbr=on}}) is an [[entrenched river]] in a [[fault (geology)|fault line]] which separates Middle Belgium (elevation {{convert|100|\u2013|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and High Belgium ({{convert|200|\u2013|700|m|ft|abbr=on}}). This fault line corresponds to a part of the southern coast of the late [[London-Brabant Massif]]. The valley, along with [[Haine]] and [[Vesdre]] valleys form the ''[[sillon industriel]]'', the historical centre of the Belgian coalmining and steelmaking industry, and is also called the Walloon industrial backbone.  Due to their long industrial historic record, several segments of the valley have received specific names: [[Borinage]], around [[Mons]], le [[Centre (Wallonia)|Centre]], around [[La Louvi\u00e8re]], the [[Pays noir]], around [[Charleroi]] and the [[Basse-Sambre]], near [[Namur (city)|Namur]].\n\nTo the north of the Sambre and Meuse valley lies the Central Belgian plateau, which is characterized by [[intensive agriculture]]. The Walloon part of this plateau is traditionally divided into several regions: [[Walloon Brabant]] around [[Nivelles]],  [[Western Hainaut]] ({{lang-fr|Wallonie picarde}}, around [[Tournai]]), and [[Hesbaye]] around [[Waremme]].  South of the sillon industriel, the land is more rugged and is characterized by more [[extensive farming]]. It is traditionally divided into the regions of [[Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse]], [[Condroz]], [[Fagne (natural region)|Fagne]]-[[Famenne]], the [[Ardennes]] and [[Land of Herve]], as well as the [[Belgian Lorraine]] around [[Arlon]] and [[Virton]]. Dividing it into [[Condroz]], [[Famenne]], [[Calestienne]], [[Ardennes]] (including [[Thi\u00e9rache]]), and Belgian Lorraine (which includes the [[Gaume]]) is more reflective of the physical geography.  The larger region, the Ardennes, is a thickly forested plateau with caves and small gorges.  It is host to much of Belgium's wildlife but little agricultural capacity.

But that was already the case before the Industrial Revolution, with an engineer as [[Rennequin Sualem]] for instance.\n\nEngineer [[Zenobe Gramme]] invented the [[Gramme dynamo]], the first generator to produce power on a commercial scale for industry. Chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] gave his name to the [[Solvay process]] for production of [[soda ash]], important chemical for many industrial uses.  Ernest Solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave its name to the [[Solvay Institute of Sociology]], the [[Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management]] and the [[International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry]] which are now part of the [[Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles]].

In ancient times, the [[Sambre and Meuse valley]] was an important industrial area in the [[Roman Empire]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], Wallonia became a center for [[brass]] working and [[bronze]] working, with [[Huy]], [[Dinant]] and [[Chimay]] being important regional centers. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the iron masters of [[Li\u00e8ge]] developed a method of refining iron ore by the use of a blast furnace, called the [[Oregrounds iron|Walloon Method]]. There were also a few coal mines around [[Charleroi]] and the [[Borinage]] during this period, but their output was small, and was principally consumed as a fuel by various industries such as the important glass making industry that sprang up in the [[Charleroi]] basin during the 14th century.<ref>Allan H.

One of these is the Walloon Region, which is governed by the [[Parliament of Wallonia]] and the executive [[Walloon Government]]. The Walloon Region's autonomy extends even to foreign policy; Wallonia is entitled to pursue its own foreign policy, including the signing of treaties, and in many domains even the Belgian federal government is not able to sign an international treaty without the agreement of the Parliament of Wallonia.\n\nWallonia is also home to about 80 percent of the population of the [[French Community of Belgium]], a political level responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education, with the remainder living in [[Brussels]].  Wallonia is also home to the small [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]] in the east, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues. Although in [[Flanders]], the [[Flemish Region]] assigned all of its powers to the [[Flemish Community]], the Walloon Region remains in principle distinct from and independent from the French Community, and vice versa. Despite this, the [[Parliament of the French Community|French Community's parliament]] is almost entirely composed of members of Wallonia's and Brussels' parliaments, so the bodies are governed by the same individuals. Additionally, the French Community of Belgium has controversially begun referring to itself exclusively as the 'Wallonia-Brussels Federation' to emphasize the links between the French Community, Wallonia and Brussels.\n\nThe Walloon Region has a [[unicameral parliament]] with 75 members elected for five years by direct [[universal suffrage]], and an executive, the [[Walloon Government]], elected by a political majority in Parliament. The Government numbers nine members with the president. Each member is called a ''Walloon minister''. The head of the Government is called the [[Minister-President of Wallonia]]. The coalition government for the 2014\u20132019 legislature was a center-left coalition [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|PS]]-[[cdH]] until July 28 when it was replaced by a center-left coalition MR-cdH. The current Minister-President is [[Elio Di Rupo]].\n\n===History of Walloon autonomy===\n{{main|Walloon Movement|History of the Walloon Movement}}\n\"From 1831, the year of Belgium's independence, until the federalization of the country in 1970, Wallonia has increasingly asserted itself as a region in its own right.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallonie.be/en/discover-wallonia/history/index.html|title=Official Website of the Walloon Region|publisher=}}</ref> Following several [[State reform in Belgium|state reforms]], especially the 1993 state reform, Belgium became a federal state made up of three communities and three regions, with Wallonia being represented by the Walloon Region and its two language communities. The directly elected Walloon Parliament was created in June 1995, replacing the ''Conseil r\u00e9gional wallon'' (Regional Council of Wallonia). The first Council had sat on 15 October 1980 and was composed of members of the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Belgian Chamber of Representatives]] and the [[Belgian Senate]] elected in Wallonia.\n\n==Symbols==\n[[File:Fosses-la-Ville JPG01W.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A red rooster is the main symbol of Wallonia]]\nThe first appearance of the French word ''Wallonie'' as a reference to the romance world as opposed to Germany is said to date from 1842.<ref>There is also a mention of ''Wallonie'' in 1825 : {{in lang|fr}} \u00ab les Germains, au contraire, r\u00e9servant pour eux seuls le noble nom de Franks, s'obstinaient, d\u00e8s le onzi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, \u00e0 ne plus voir de Franks dans la Gaule, qu'ils nommaient d\u00e9daigneusement Wallonie, terre des Wallons ou des Welsches \u00bb [[Augustin Thierry]], ''Histoire de la conqu\u00eate de l'Angleterre par les Normands'', \u00c9d.

Note that in all areas, except the German-speaking part, French is currently the dominant language.]]\n\nFrench is the major language spoken in Wallonia. German is spoken in the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], in the east. Belgian French is rather similar to that spoken in France, with slight differences in pronunciation and some vocabulary differences, notably the use of the words ''septante'' (70) and ''nonante'' (90), as opposed to ''soixante-dix'' and ''quatre-vingt-dix'' in France.\n\nThere are noticeable Walloon accents, with the accent from [[Li\u00e8ge]] and its surroundings being perhaps the most striking. Other regions of Wallonia also have characteristic accents, often linked to the regional language.\n\n[[Walloons]] traditionally also speak regional Romance languages, all from the ''[[Langues d'o\u00efl]]'' group. Wallonia includes almost all of the area where [[Walloon language|Walloon]] is spoken, a [[Picard language|Picard]] zone corresponding to the major part of the [[Province of Hainaut]], the [[Gaume]] (district of [[Virton]]) with the [[Lorrain language]] and a [[Champenois]] zone. There are also regional Germanic languages, such as the [[Luxembourgish language]] in [[Arelerland]] (Land of [[Arlon]]). The regional languages of Wallonia are more important than in France, and they have been officially recognized by the government. With the development of education in French, however, these dialects have been in continual decline. There is currently an effort to revive Walloon dialects; some schools offer language courses in Walloon, and Walloon is also spoken in some radio programmes, but this effort remains very limited.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n===Literature===\n[[Image:Marionetes Tchantch\u00e8s.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Traditional puppets ([[Charlemagne]] [[Tchantch\u00e8s]]) of an (also)   [[avant-garde]]  theater linking [[French language]] and [[Walloon language]] literature ]]\n\n====In Walloon====\nLiterature is written principally in French but also in Walloon and other regional languages, colloquially called Walloon literature. [[Walloon language|Walloon]] literature (regional language not French) has been printed since the 16th century. But it did have its golden age, paradoxically, during the peak of the [[Flemish immigration to Wallonia]] in the 19th century:  \"That period saw an efflorescence of Walloon literature, plays and poems primarily, and the founding of many theaters and periodicals.\"<ref>'Switching Languages', Translingual Writers Reflect on Their Craft, Edited by Steven G.

Out of nearly a thousand, twenty-six were published before 1880. Thereafter the numbers rise gradually year by year, reaching a peak of sixty-nine in 1903, and then they fall again, down to eleven in 1913. See 'Switching Languages', p.&nbsp;153. Yves Quairiaux counted 4800 plays for 1860\u20131914, published or not. In this period plays were almost the only popular show in Wallonia. But this theater remains popular in the present-day Wallonia: Theater is still flourishing, with over 200 non-professional companies playing in the cities and villages of Wallonia for an audience of over 200,000 each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/lorint/wallang/index.html|title=The Walloon language page|work=skynet.be}}</ref>  There are links between French literature and (the very small)  Walloon literature.

Among them the masterpiece of [[Renier de Huy]] and perhaps of the whole Mosan art [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge]]. The architecture of Roman churches of the [[Walloon country]] are also named mosan, exemplified by the [[Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude]] in [[Nivelles]], and the churches of [[Waha]] and [[Hasti\u00e8re]], [[Dinant]]. The [[Ornamental brassware]] is also a part of the Mosan art and among these dinandiers [[Hugo d'Oignies]] and [[Nicholas of Verdun]].\n\n[[Jacques du Broeucq]] was a sculptor of the 16th century.\n\n[[Flemish art]] was not confined to the boundaries of modern Flanders and several leading artists came from or worked in areas in which langues d'o\u00efl were spoken, from the region of modern Wallonia, e.g. [[Robert Campin]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (Rogier de la Pasture) and [[Jacques Daret]]. [[Joachim Patinir]] [[Herri met de Bles|Henri Bl\u00e8s]] are generally called [[Mosan art|mosan]] painters.

Robert Wangerm\u00e9e and Philippe Mercier wrote in their encyclopedic book about the Walloon music that [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Cambrai]] and  [[Province of Hainaut|Hainaut]]  played a leading part in the so-called Franco-Flemish School.<ref>Robert Wangerm\u00e9e et Philippe Mercier,  La musique en Wallonie et \u00e0 Bruxelles, La Renaissance du livre, Bruxelles, 1980, Tome I, p. 10.</ref>\n\nAmong them were [[Orlande de Lassus]], [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Guillaume Dufay]] In the 19th and 20th centuries, there was an emergence of major violinists, such as [[Henri Vieuxtemps]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]] (author of the unique opera in [[Walloon language|Walloon]] during the 20th century ''Pi\u00e9re li houye\u00fb'' - Pierre the miner - based on a real incident which occurred in 1877 during a miners' strike in the Li\u00e8ge region), and [[Arthur Grumiaux]], while [[Adolphe Sax]] (born in [[Dinant]]) invented the [[saxophone]] in 1846.

Pousseur's music employs [[serialism]], mobile forms, and aleatory, often mediating between or among seemingly irreconcilable styles, such as those of [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]] and [[Anton Webern|Webern]] (''[[Votre Faust]]''), or Pousseur's own serial style and the protest song \"We shall overcome\" (''Couleurs crois\u00e9es'').

It is perhaps the reason why the documentary ''[[Mis\u00e8re au Borinage]]'', and especially its co-director [[Henri Storck]], is considered by Robert Stallaerts as the father of the Walloon cinema. He wrote: \"Although a Fleming, he can be called the father of the Walloon cinema.\".<ref>''Historical dictionary of Belgium''  (Scarecrow press, 1999, p. 191 {{ISBN|0-8108-3603-3}}).</ref> For F.Andr\u00e9 between ''Mis\u00e8re au Borinage'' and the films like those of the [[Dardenne brothers]] (since 1979), there is ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 s'envole la fleur maigre]]'' (1960) (also shot in the [[Borinage]]),<ref>''Cin\u00e9ma wallon et r\u00e9alit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re'', in TOUDI, n\u00b0 49/50, septembre-octobre 2002, p.13.</ref> a film regarded as a point of reference in the history of the cinema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autourdu1ermai.fr/motscles/chemins/motcle-chemins-5.html|title=les films rep\u00e8res dans l'histoire du cin\u00e9ma|work=autourdu1ermai.fr}}</ref>  Like those of the [[Dardenne brothers]], [[Thierry Michel]], [[Jean-Jacques Andrien]], [[Beno\u00eet Mariage]], or, e.g.  the social documentaries of [[Patric Jean]], the director of [[Les enfants du Borinage]] writing his film as a letter to Henri Storck. On the other hand, films such as [[Thierry Z\u00e9no]]'s ''[[Vase de noces]]'' (1974), ''Mireille in the life of the others'' by [[Jean-Marie Buchet]] (1979), ''C'est arriv\u00e9 pr\u00e8s de chez vous'' (English title: ''[[Man Bites Dog (film)|Man bites dog]]'') by [[R\u00e9my Belvaux]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Bonzel]] (1992) and the works of [[No\u00ebl Godin]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau (author-filmmaker)|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] are influenced by [[surrealism]], [[absurdism]] and [[black comedy]]. The films of the [[Dardenne brothers]] are also inspired by the Bible and ''[[Le Fils]]'' for instance is regarded as one of the most spiritually significant films.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsandfaith.com/t100|title=The Arts & Faith Top 100 Films|work=artsandfaith.com}}</ref>\n\n===Festivals===\n[[Image:DragonLumecon.jpg|thumb|right|The dragon and the ''white men'' of the [[Ducasse de Mons]]]]\nThe [[Ducasse de Mons]] (Walloon French for [[Kermesse (festival)|Kermesse]]), is one of the [[UNESCO]] [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].  It comprises two important parts: the procession, the descent and the ascent of the shrine of [[Waltrude]], and the combat between [[Saint George]] and the dragon.  The combat (after the procession), plays out on the Trinity Sunday between 12:30 pm and 1:00 pm on the [[Mons]]'s central square. It represents the fight between Saint George (the good) and the dragon (the evil). The dragon is a mannequin carried and moved by the ''white men'' (''fr:Hommes blancs'').  The dragon fights Saint George by  attacking with his tail. Saint George on his horse turns clockwise and the dragon turns in the other direction. Saint George finally kills the dragon.\n\nThe [[Gilles]] of  [[Binche]] and the giants' procession in  [[Ath]] are also [[UNESCO]] [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n[[File:Orval et son verre crop.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Trappist beer]] [[Orval Brewery|Orval]], with a branded glass]]\n\nWallonia is famous for a number of different foods and drinks, a great many of which are specialties of certain cities or regions. The 1957 [[Michelin Guide]] noted that \"regional food has put up heroic resistance and the Walloon provinces and Flemish provinces are proud of their specialities.\"<ref>quoted by \"Culinary cultures of Europe: identity, diversity and dialogue\", by Darra Goldstein, Kathrin Merkle, Fabio Parasecoli, Stephen Mennell, Council of Europe. Directorate General IV--Education, Culture and Heritage, Youth and Sport, Council of Europe, 2005</ref>  The [[Li\u00e8ge waffle]] a rich, dense, sweet, and chewy waffle native to Li\u00e8ge, is the most popular type of waffle in Belgium, and can be found in stores and even vending machines throughout the country. [[Cougnou]], or the ''bread of Jesus'', is a sweet bread typically eaten around [[Christmas]] time and found throughout the region.\n\nOther specialties include [[Herve cheese]], an [[apple butter]] called ''[[sirop de Li\u00e8ge]]'', the [[Garden strawberry]] of [[W\u00e9pion]]. Also notable is the [[Dinant]] specialty [[Flamiche]]: These cheese tarts are not found in window displays as they are meant to be eaten straight from the oven. As one restaurateur said so well in a book about Walloon gastronomy \"it is the client who waits for the flamiche, as the flamiche does not wait for the client.<ref>[http://www.dinant.be/index.htm?lg=3&m1=28&m2=152 Dinant Official Web Site]</ref> There are also the [[Ardennes]] [[ham]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/ardennesham|title=Ardenne Ham|publisher=}}</ref> the ''tarte al djote'' from [[Nivelles]], a dessert pie made with beet leaves and cheese,<ref>The Simon and Schuster international pocket food guide, 1981.</ref> while [[tarte au riz]] is a rice-pudding filled pie from [[Verviers]].\n\nIn terms of drink, Wallonia mirrors Belgium as a whole; beer and wine are both popular, and a great diversity of beers are made and enjoyed in Wallonia. Installed in Bierghes in the Senne valley, the Gueuzerie Tilquin is the only gueuze blendery in Wallonia. Wallonia boasts three of the seven [[Trappist beer]]s (from [[Chimay]], [[Orval Brewery|Orval]] and [[Rochefort, Belgium|Rochefort]]) in addition to a great number of other locally brewed beers. Wallonia is also home to the last bastion of traditional rustic ''[[saison]]'', most notably those produced at the Brasserie de Silly and the Brasserie Dupont (located in [[:fr:Tourpes|Tourpes]], in the region of Western [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] historically known for its production of rustic farmhouse ales).  [[Jupiler]], the best-selling beer in Belgium, is brewed in [[Jupille-sur-Meuse]] in [[Li\u00e8ge]]. Wallonia also home to a [[Jenever]] called Peket, and a [[May wine]] called Maitrank.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe two largest cities in Wallonia each have an airport. The [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]] has become an important passenger airport, especially with low fares companies such as [[Ryanair]] or [[Wizzair]]. It serves as a low-cost alternative to [[Brussels Airport]], and it saw 7 303 720 passengers in 2016. The [[Li\u00e8ge Airport]] is specialized in freight, although it also operates tourist-oriented charter flights. Today, Li\u00e8ge is the 8th airport for European freight and aims to reach the 5th rank in the next decade.\n\n=== Railways, motorways, buses ===\n[[TEC (transport)|TEC]] is the single [[public transit]] authority for all of Wallonia, operating buses and trams. [[Charleroi]] is the sole Walloon city to have a [[Rapid transit|metro system]], the [[Charleroi Pre-metro]].\n\nWallonia has an extensive and well-developed rail network, served by the Belgian National Railway Company, [[SNCB]].\n\nWallonia's numerous motorways fall within the scope of the TransEuropean Transport network programme (TEN-T). This priority programme run by the European Union provides more than 70,000&nbsp;km of transport infrastructure, including motorways, express rail lines and roadways, and has been developed to carry substantial volumes of traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investinwallonia.be/ofi-belgium/investir-en-wallonie/vivre-en-wallonie/se-deplacer.php|title=AWEX|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Waterways ===\nWith traffic of over 20 million tonnes and 26 kilometres of quays, the [[autonomous port]] of Li\u00e8ge (PAL) is the third largest inland port in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liege.port-autonome.be/en/pages/liege-port-autonome.aspx|title=Liege port authority|publisher=}}</ref> It carries out the management of 31 ports along the Meuse and the [[Albert Canal]]. It is accessible to sea and river transporters weighing up to 2,500 tonnes, and to push two-barge convoys (4,500 tonnes, soon to be raised to 9,000 tonnes). Even if Wallonia does not have direct access to the sea, it is very well connected to the major ports thanks to an extensive network of navigable waterways that pervades Belgium, and it has effective river connections to [[Antwerp]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Dunkirk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.logisticsinwallonia.be/index.php?page=94&lng=en&text=L%252592excellence+logistique|title=Qui sommes-nous? - logistics in Wallonia|website=www.logisticsinwallonia.be}}</ref>\n\nOn the west side of Wallonia, in the [[Province of Hainaut]], the [[Str\u00e9py-Thieu boat lift]], permits river traffic of up to the new 1350-tonne standard to pass between the waterways of the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] and [[Scheldt]] rivers.

As the southern portion of the country, Wallonia is primarily [[Francophone|French-speaking]], and accounts for 55% of Belgium's territory, but only a third of its population. The Walloon Region was not merged with the [[French Community of Belgium]], which is the political entity responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education, because the French Community of Belgium encompasses both Wallonia and the majority French-Speaking [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]]. \n\nThe German-speaking minority in eastern Wallonia results from [[World War I]] and the subsequent annexation of three [[Eupen-Malmedy|cantons]] that were initially part of the former German empire. This community represents less than 1%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/european_languages/countries/belgium.shtml|title=BBC - Languages - Languages|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> of the Belgian population. It forms the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues.\n\nDuring the industrial revolution, Wallonia was second only to the United Kingdom in industrialization, capitalizing on its extensive deposits of [[coal]] and [[iron]]. This brought the region wealth, and from the beginning of the 19th to the middle of the 20th century, Wallonia was the more prosperous half of Belgium. Since [[World War II]], the importance of heavy industry has greatly diminished, and the [[Flemish Region]] surpassed Wallonia in wealth, as Wallonia declined economically. Wallonia now suffers from high unemployment and has a significantly lower GDP per capita than Flanders. The economic inequalities and linguistic divide between the two are major sources of political conflicts in Belgium and a major factor in [[Flemish separatism]].\n\nThe capital of Wallonia is [[Namur (city)|Namur]], and the most populous city is [[Li\u00e8ge]]. Most of Wallonia's major cities and two-thirds of its population lie along the [[Sambre and Meuse valley]], the former industrial backbone of Belgium. To the north lies the Central Belgian Plateau, which, like Flanders, is relatively flat and agriculturally fertile. In the southeast lie the [[Ardennes]], hilly and sparsely populated. Wallonia borders [[Flanders]] and the [[Netherlands]] ([[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]) in the north, [[France]] ([[Grand Est]] and [[Hauts-de-France]]) to the south and west, and [[Germany]] ([[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]) and [[Luxembourg]] ([[Capellen (canton)|Capellen]], [[Clervaux (canton)|Clervaux]], [[Esch-sur-Alzette (canton)|Esch-sur-Alzette]], [[Redange (canton)|Redange]] and [[Wiltz (canton)|Wiltz]]) to the east. Wallonia has been a member of the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1980.\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe term \"Wallonia\" can mean slightly different things in different contexts. One of the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|federal regions of Belgium]] is still constitutionally defined as the Walloon Region, but the region's government has renamed it Wallonia, and it is commonly called Wallonia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gouvernement.wallonie.be/identite-wallonne-la-region-wallonne-fait-place-la-wallonie-et-namur-est-sa-capitale-01-04-10|title=French : Le Gouvernement a d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de promouvoir le terme \u00ab Wallonie \u00bb en lieu et place de \u00ab R\u00e9gion wallonne \u00bb.|publisher=}}</ref><ref>For example, the [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/be.html CIA World Factbook] states Wallonia is the short form and Walloon Region is the long form.

Wallonia is named after the [[Walloons]], the population of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] speaking [[Romance languages]].

On Lotharingia's breakup in 959, the present-day territory of Belgium became part of [[Lower Lotharingia]], which then fragmented into rival principalities and duchies by 1190.

After [[World War II]], major strikes included the [[general strike against Leopold III of Belgium]] (1950), and the [[1960-1961 Winter General Strike]] for autonomy for Wallonia.\n\nThe profitability of the heavy industries to which Wallonia owed its prosperity started declining in the first half of the 20th century, and the center of industrial activity shifted north to Flanders. The loss of prosperity caused social unrest, and Wallonia sought greater autonomy in order to address its economic problems. In the wake of the [[1960-1961 Winter General Strike]], the process of [[state reform in Belgium]] got under way. This reform started partly with the [[Language legislation in Belgium|linguistic laws of 1962-63]], which defined the four language areas within the [[Constitution of Belgium|constitution]]. But the strikes of 1960 which took place in Wallonia more than in [[Flanders]] are not principally linked with the four language areas nor with the Communities but with the Regions.  In 1968, the conflict between the communities burst out. The French speakers were driven out of the Leuven campus of the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] amid shouts of \"Walen buiten!\" (\"Walloons out!\") and were given a [[Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain|brand new campus]] in the French-speaking area of the province.<ref name=\"RegionAsserts\" /> This led to [[State reform in Belgium]], which resulted in the creation of the Walloon Region and the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]], both of which have considerable autonomy.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[Image:Belgium resources 1968.jpg|thumb|left|Coalmining and steelmaking industrial areas in Belgium.

This fault line corresponds to a part of the southern coast of the late [[London-Brabant Massif]]. The valley, along with [[Haine]] and [[Vesdre]] valleys form the ''[[sillon industriel]]'', the historical centre of the Belgian coalmining and steelmaking industry, and is also called the Walloon industrial backbone.  Due to their long industrial historic record, several segments of the valley have received specific names: [[Borinage]], around [[Mons]], le [[Centre (Wallonia)|Centre]], around [[La Louvi\u00e8re]], the [[Pays noir]], around [[Charleroi]] and the [[Basse-Sambre]], near [[Namur (city)|Namur]].\n\nTo the north of the Sambre and Meuse valley lies the Central Belgian plateau, which is characterized by [[intensive agriculture]]. The Walloon part of this plateau is traditionally divided into several regions: [[Walloon Brabant]] around [[Nivelles]],  [[Western Hainaut]] ({{lang-fr|Wallonie picarde}}, around [[Tournai]]), and [[Hesbaye]] around [[Waremme]].  South of the sillon industriel, the land is more rugged and is characterized by more [[extensive farming]]. It is traditionally divided into the regions of [[Entre-Sambre-et-Meuse]], [[Condroz]], [[Fagne (natural region)|Fagne]]-[[Famenne]], the [[Ardennes]] and [[Land of Herve]], as well as the [[Belgian Lorraine]] around [[Arlon]] and [[Virton]]. Dividing it into [[Condroz]], [[Famenne]], [[Calestienne]], [[Ardennes]] (including [[Thi\u00e9rache]]), and Belgian Lorraine (which includes the [[Gaume]]) is more reflective of the physical geography.  The larger region, the Ardennes, is a thickly forested plateau with caves and small gorges.  It is host to much of Belgium's wildlife but little agricultural capacity. This area extends westward into France and eastward to the [[Eifel]] in Germany via the [[High Fens]] plateau, on which the [[Signal de Botrange]] forms the highest point in Belgium at 694 metres (2,277&nbsp;ft).\n[[File:Charleroi - place Charles II.jpg|150px|thumb|right|View of Charleroi]]\n\n== Subdivisions ==\nThe [[Wallonia|Walloon region]] covers {{convert|16901|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and is divided into [[Provinces of Belgium|five provinces]], [[Arrondissements of Belgium|20 arrondissements]] and [[List of municipalities of Wallonia|262 cities or municipalities]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Province !!

Chemist [[Ernest Solvay]] gave his name to the [[Solvay process]] for production of [[soda ash]], important chemical for many industrial uses.  Ernest Solvay also acted as a major philanthropist and gave its name to the [[Solvay Institute of Sociology]], the [[Solvay Brussels School of Economics and Management]] and the [[International Solvay Institutes for Physics and Chemistry]] which are now part of the [[Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles]]. In 1911, he started a series of conferences, the [[Solvay Conference|Solvay Conferences on Physics and Chemistry]], which have had a deep impact on the evolution of quantum physics and chemistry.\n\n[[Georges Lema\u00eetre]] of the [[Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain]] is credited with proposing the [[Big Bang]] theory of the origin of the universe in 1927.\n\nThree [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine]] were awarded to Walloons: [[Jules Bordet]] ([[Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles]]) in 1919,  [[Albert Claude]] (Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles) together with [[Christian De Duve]] (Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain) in 1974.\n\nIn the present day, [[Bureau Greisch]] has acquired an international reputation as consulting engineer and architect in the fields of structures, civil engineering and buildings, including the [[Millau Viaduct]] in France.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[Image:Ougree 16.jpg|thumb|[[Steel]]making along the [[Meuse River]] at [[Ougr\u00e9e]], near [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]], on the ''[[sillon industriel]]'']]\nWallonia is rich in [[iron]] and [[coal]], and these resources and related industries have played an important role in its history. In ancient times, the [[Sambre and Meuse valley]] was an important industrial area in the [[Roman Empire]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], Wallonia became a center for [[brass]] working and [[bronze]] working, with [[Huy]], [[Dinant]] and [[Chimay]] being important regional centers. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the iron masters of [[Li\u00e8ge]] developed a method of refining iron ore by the use of a blast furnace, called the [[Oregrounds iron|Walloon Method]]. There were also a few coal mines around [[Charleroi]] and the [[Borinage]] during this period, but their output was small, and was principally consumed as a fuel by various industries such as the important glass making industry that sprang up in the [[Charleroi]] basin during the 14th century.<ref>Allan H.

One of these is the Walloon Region, which is governed by the [[Parliament of Wallonia]] and the executive [[Walloon Government]]. The Walloon Region's autonomy extends even to foreign policy; Wallonia is entitled to pursue its own foreign policy, including the signing of treaties, and in many domains even the Belgian federal government is not able to sign an international treaty without the agreement of the Parliament of Wallonia.\n\nWallonia is also home to about 80 percent of the population of the [[French Community of Belgium]], a political level responsible for matters related mainly to culture and education, with the remainder living in [[Brussels]].  Wallonia is also home to the small [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]] in the east, which has its own government and parliament for culture-related issues. Although in [[Flanders]], the [[Flemish Region]] assigned all of its powers to the [[Flemish Community]], the Walloon Region remains in principle distinct from and independent from the French Community, and vice versa. Despite this, the [[Parliament of the French Community|French Community's parliament]] is almost entirely composed of members of Wallonia's and Brussels' parliaments, so the bodies are governed by the same individuals. Additionally, the French Community of Belgium has controversially begun referring to itself exclusively as the 'Wallonia-Brussels Federation' to emphasize the links between the French Community, Wallonia and Brussels.\n\nThe Walloon Region has a [[unicameral parliament]] with 75 members elected for five years by direct [[universal suffrage]], and an executive, the [[Walloon Government]], elected by a political majority in Parliament. The Government numbers nine members with the president. Each member is called a ''Walloon minister''. The head of the Government is called the [[Minister-President of Wallonia]]. The coalition government for the 2014\u20132019 legislature was a center-left coalition [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|PS]]-[[cdH]] until July 28 when it was replaced by a center-left coalition MR-cdH. The current Minister-President is [[Elio Di Rupo]].\n\n===History of Walloon autonomy===\n{{main|Walloon Movement|History of the Walloon Movement}}\n\"From 1831, the year of Belgium's independence, until the federalization of the country in 1970, Wallonia has increasingly asserted itself as a region in its own right.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallonie.be/en/discover-wallonia/history/index.html|title=Official Website of the Walloon Region|publisher=}}</ref> Following several [[State reform in Belgium|state reforms]], especially the 1993 state reform, Belgium became a federal state made up of three communities and three regions, with Wallonia being represented by the Walloon Region and its two language communities. The directly elected Walloon Parliament was created in June 1995, replacing the ''Conseil r\u00e9gional wallon'' (Regional Council of Wallonia). The first Council had sat on 15 October 1980 and was composed of members of the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Belgian Chamber of Representatives]] and the [[Belgian Senate]] elected in Wallonia.\n\n==Symbols==\n[[File:Fosses-la-Ville JPG01W.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A red rooster is the main symbol of Wallonia]]\nThe first appearance of the French word ''Wallonie'' as a reference to the romance world as opposed to Germany is said to date from 1842.<ref>There is also a mention of ''Wallonie'' in 1825 : {{in lang|fr}} \u00ab les Germains, au contraire, r\u00e9servant pour eux seuls le noble nom de Franks, s'obstinaient, d\u00e8s le onzi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, \u00e0 ne plus voir de Franks dans la Gaule, qu'ils nommaient d\u00e9daigneusement Wallonie, terre des Wallons ou des Welsches \u00bb [[Augustin Thierry]], ''Histoire de la conqu\u00eate de l'Angleterre par les Normands'', \u00c9d.

Note that in all areas, except the German-speaking part, French is currently the dominant language.]]\n\nFrench is the major language spoken in Wallonia. German is spoken in the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], in the east. Belgian French is rather similar to that spoken in France, with slight differences in pronunciation and some vocabulary differences, notably the use of the words ''septante'' (70) and ''nonante'' (90), as opposed to ''soixante-dix'' and ''quatre-vingt-dix'' in France.\n\nThere are noticeable Walloon accents, with the accent from [[Li\u00e8ge]] and its surroundings being perhaps the most striking. Other regions of Wallonia also have characteristic accents, often linked to the regional language.\n\n[[Walloons]] traditionally also speak regional Romance languages, all from the ''[[Langues d'o\u00efl]]'' group. Wallonia includes almost all of the area where [[Walloon language|Walloon]] is spoken, a [[Picard language|Picard]] zone corresponding to the major part of the [[Province of Hainaut]], the [[Gaume]] (district of [[Virton]]) with the [[Lorrain language]] and a [[Champenois]] zone. There are also regional Germanic languages, such as the [[Luxembourgish language]] in [[Arelerland]] (Land of [[Arlon]]). The regional languages of Wallonia are more important than in France, and they have been officially recognized by the government. With the development of education in French, however, these dialects have been in continual decline. There is currently an effort to revive Walloon dialects; some schools offer language courses in Walloon, and Walloon is also spoken in some radio programmes, but this effort remains very limited.\n\n== Culture ==\n\n===Literature===\n[[Image:Marionetes Tchantch\u00e8s.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Traditional puppets ([[Charlemagne]] [[Tchantch\u00e8s]]) of an (also)   [[avant-garde]]  theater linking [[French language]] and [[Walloon language]] literature ]]\n\n====In Walloon====\nLiterature is written principally in French but also in Walloon and other regional languages, colloquially called Walloon literature. [[Walloon language|Walloon]] literature (regional language not French) has been printed since the 16th century. But it did have its golden age, paradoxically, during the peak of the [[Flemish immigration to Wallonia]] in the 19th century:  \"That period saw an efflorescence of Walloon literature, plays and poems primarily, and the founding of many theaters and periodicals.\"<ref>'Switching Languages', Translingual Writers Reflect on Their Craft, Edited by Steven G.

Out of nearly a thousand, twenty-six were published before 1880. Thereafter the numbers rise gradually year by year, reaching a peak of sixty-nine in 1903, and then they fall again, down to eleven in 1913. See 'Switching Languages', p.&nbsp;153. Yves Quairiaux counted 4800 plays for 1860\u20131914, published or not. In this period plays were almost the only popular show in Wallonia. But this theater remains popular in the present-day Wallonia: Theater is still flourishing, with over 200 non-professional companies playing in the cities and villages of Wallonia for an audience of over 200,000 each year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/lorint/wallang/index.html|title=The Walloon language page|work=skynet.be}}</ref>  There are links between French literature and (the very small)  Walloon literature. For instance [[Raymond Queneau]] set  [[Editions Gallimard]] the publication of a Walloon Poets' anthology. [[Ubu roi]] was translated in Walloon by [[Andr\u00e9 Blavier]] ( an important [['Pataphysics|pataphysician]] of [[Verviers]], friend of Queneau), for the new and important [[Puppets]] theater of Li\u00e8ge of Jacques Ancion, the [[Al Botro\u00fble]] theater \"at the umbilical cord\" in Walloon indicating a desire to return to the source (according to Joan Cross).

Among them the masterpiece of [[Renier de Huy]] and perhaps of the whole Mosan art [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Li\u00e8ge]]. The architecture of Roman churches of the [[Walloon country]] are also named mosan, exemplified by the [[Collegiate Church of Saint Gertrude]] in [[Nivelles]], and the churches of [[Waha]] and [[Hasti\u00e8re]], [[Dinant]]. The [[Ornamental brassware]] is also a part of the Mosan art and among these dinandiers [[Hugo d'Oignies]] and [[Nicholas of Verdun]].\n\n[[Jacques du Broeucq]] was a sculptor of the 16th century.\n\n[[Flemish art]] was not confined to the boundaries of modern Flanders and several leading artists came from or worked in areas in which langues d'o\u00efl were spoken, from the region of modern Wallonia, e.g. [[Robert Campin]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]] (Rogier de la Pasture) and [[Jacques Daret]]. [[Joachim Patinir]] [[Herri met de Bles|Henri Bl\u00e8s]] are generally called [[Mosan art|mosan]] painters.

Robert Wangerm\u00e9e and Philippe Mercier wrote in their encyclopedic book about the Walloon music that [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Cambrai]] and  [[Province of Hainaut|Hainaut]]  played a leading part in the so-called Franco-Flemish School.<ref>Robert Wangerm\u00e9e et Philippe Mercier,  La musique en Wallonie et \u00e0 Bruxelles, La Renaissance du livre, Bruxelles, 1980, Tome I, p. 10.</ref>\n\nAmong them were [[Orlande de Lassus]], [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Guillaume Dufay]] In the 19th and 20th centuries, there was an emergence of major violinists, such as [[Henri Vieuxtemps]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe]] (author of the unique opera in [[Walloon language|Walloon]] during the 20th century ''Pi\u00e9re li houye\u00fb'' - Pierre the miner - based on a real incident which occurred in 1877 during a miners' strike in the Li\u00e8ge region), and [[Arthur Grumiaux]], while [[Adolphe Sax]] (born in [[Dinant]]) invented the [[saxophone]] in 1846.

It is perhaps the reason why the documentary ''[[Mis\u00e8re au Borinage]]'', and especially its co-director [[Henri Storck]], is considered by Robert Stallaerts as the father of the Walloon cinema. He wrote: \"Although a Fleming, he can be called the father of the Walloon cinema.\".<ref>''Historical dictionary of Belgium''  (Scarecrow press, 1999, p. 191 {{ISBN|0-8108-3603-3}}).</ref> For F.Andr\u00e9 between ''Mis\u00e8re au Borinage'' and the films like those of the [[Dardenne brothers]] (since 1979), there is ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 s'envole la fleur maigre]]'' (1960) (also shot in the [[Borinage]]),<ref>''Cin\u00e9ma wallon et r\u00e9alit\u00e9 particuli\u00e8re'', in TOUDI, n\u00b0 49/50, septembre-octobre 2002, p.13.</ref> a film regarded as a point of reference in the history of the cinema.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autourdu1ermai.fr/motscles/chemins/motcle-chemins-5.html|title=les films rep\u00e8res dans l'histoire du cin\u00e9ma|work=autourdu1ermai.fr}}</ref>  Like those of the [[Dardenne brothers]], [[Thierry Michel]], [[Jean-Jacques Andrien]], [[Beno\u00eet Mariage]], or, e.g.  the social documentaries of [[Patric Jean]], the director of [[Les enfants du Borinage]] writing his film as a letter to Henri Storck.

It comprises two important parts: the procession, the descent and the ascent of the shrine of [[Waltrude]], and the combat between [[Saint George]] and the dragon.  The combat (after the procession), plays out on the Trinity Sunday between 12:30 pm and 1:00 pm on the [[Mons]]'s central square. It represents the fight between Saint George (the good) and the dragon (the evil). The dragon is a mannequin carried and moved by the ''white men'' (''fr:Hommes blancs'').  The dragon fights Saint George by  attacking with his tail. Saint George on his horse turns clockwise and the dragon turns in the other direction. Saint George finally kills the dragon.\n\nThe [[Gilles]] of  [[Binche]] and the giants' procession in  [[Ath]] are also [[UNESCO]] [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n[[File:Orval et son verre crop.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Trappist beer]] [[Orval Brewery|Orval]], with a branded glass]]\n\nWallonia is famous for a number of different foods and drinks, a great many of which are specialties of certain cities or regions. The 1957 [[Michelin Guide]] noted that \"regional food has put up heroic resistance and the Walloon provinces and Flemish provinces are proud of their specialities.\"<ref>quoted by \"Culinary cultures of Europe: identity, diversity and dialogue\", by Darra Goldstein, Kathrin Merkle, Fabio Parasecoli, Stephen Mennell, Council of Europe. Directorate General IV--Education, Culture and Heritage, Youth and Sport, Council of Europe, 2005</ref>  The [[Li\u00e8ge waffle]] a rich, dense, sweet, and chewy waffle native to Li\u00e8ge, is the most popular type of waffle in Belgium, and can be found in stores and even vending machines throughout the country. [[Cougnou]], or the ''bread of Jesus'', is a sweet bread typically eaten around [[Christmas]] time and found throughout the region.\n\nOther specialties include [[Herve cheese]], an [[apple butter]] called ''[[sirop de Li\u00e8ge]]'', the [[Garden strawberry]] of [[W\u00e9pion]]. Also notable is the [[Dinant]] specialty [[Flamiche]]: These cheese tarts are not found in window displays as they are meant to be eaten straight from the oven. As one restaurateur said so well in a book about Walloon gastronomy \"it is the client who waits for the flamiche, as the flamiche does not wait for the client.<ref>[http://www.dinant.be/index.htm?lg=3&m1=28&m2=152 Dinant Official Web Site]</ref> There are also the [[Ardennes]] [[ham]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/ardennesham|title=Ardenne Ham|publisher=}}</ref> the ''tarte al djote'' from [[Nivelles]], a dessert pie made with beet leaves and cheese,<ref>The Simon and Schuster international pocket food guide, 1981.</ref> while [[tarte au riz]] is a rice-pudding filled pie from [[Verviers]].\n\nIn terms of drink, Wallonia mirrors Belgium as a whole; beer and wine are both popular, and a great diversity of beers are made and enjoyed in Wallonia. Installed in Bierghes in the Senne valley, the Gueuzerie Tilquin is the only gueuze blendery in Wallonia. Wallonia boasts three of the seven [[Trappist beer]]s (from [[Chimay]], [[Orval Brewery|Orval]] and [[Rochefort, Belgium|Rochefort]]) in addition to a great number of other locally brewed beers. Wallonia is also home to the last bastion of traditional rustic ''[[saison]]'', most notably those produced at the Brasserie de Silly and the Brasserie Dupont (located in [[:fr:Tourpes|Tourpes]], in the region of Western [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]] historically known for its production of rustic farmhouse ales).  [[Jupiler]], the best-selling beer in Belgium, is brewed in [[Jupille-sur-Meuse]] in [[Li\u00e8ge]]. Wallonia also home to a [[Jenever]] called Peket, and a [[May wine]] called Maitrank.\n\n==Transportation==\n\n=== Airports ===\nThe two largest cities in Wallonia each have an airport. The [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]] has become an important passenger airport, especially with low fares companies such as [[Ryanair]] or [[Wizzair]]. It serves as a low-cost alternative to [[Brussels Airport]], and it saw 7 303 720 passengers in 2016. The [[Li\u00e8ge Airport]] is specialized in freight, although it also operates tourist-oriented charter flights. Today, Li\u00e8ge is the 8th airport for European freight and aims to reach the 5th rank in the next decade.\n\n=== Railways, motorways, buses ===\n[[TEC (transport)|TEC]] is the single [[public transit]] authority for all of Wallonia, operating buses and trams. [[Charleroi]] is the sole Walloon city to have a [[Rapid transit|metro system]], the [[Charleroi Pre-metro]].\n\nWallonia has an extensive and well-developed rail network, served by the Belgian National Railway Company, [[SNCB]].\n\nWallonia's numerous motorways fall within the scope of the TransEuropean Transport network programme (TEN-T). This priority programme run by the European Union provides more than 70,000&nbsp;km of transport infrastructure, including motorways, express rail lines and roadways, and has been developed to carry substantial volumes of traffic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investinwallonia.be/ofi-belgium/investir-en-wallonie/vivre-en-wallonie/se-deplacer.php|title=AWEX|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Waterways ===\nWith traffic of over 20 million tonnes and 26 kilometres of quays, the [[autonomous port]] of Li\u00e8ge (PAL) is the third largest inland port in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liege.port-autonome.be/en/pages/liege-port-autonome.aspx|title=Liege port authority|publisher=}}</ref> It carries out the management of 31 ports along the Meuse and the [[Albert Canal]]. It is accessible to sea and river transporters weighing up to 2,500 tonnes, and to push two-barge convoys (4,500 tonnes, soon to be raised to 9,000 tonnes). Even if Wallonia does not have direct access to the sea, it is very well connected to the major ports thanks to an extensive network of navigable waterways that pervades Belgium, and it has effective river connections to [[Antwerp]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[Dunkirk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.logisticsinwallonia.be/index.php?page=94&lng=en&text=L%252592excellence+logistique|title=Qui sommes-nous? - logistics in Wallonia|website=www.logisticsinwallonia.be}}</ref>\n\nOn the west side of Wallonia, in the [[Province of Hainaut]], the [[Str\u00e9py-Thieu boat lift]], permits river traffic of up to the new 1350-tonne standard to pass between the waterways of the [[Meuse (river)|Meuse]] and [[Scheldt]] rivers.
