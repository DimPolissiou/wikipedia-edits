That summer Phelps borrowed $61 from Alexander Badlam, Sam Brannan's brother-in-law, to purchase a Ramage press in Boston. Buying a press, type and newsprint was one thing, but hauling it 1,100 miles from the Missouri River was another. To do the job, the Mormons turned to Howard Egan, a veteran frontiersman and future Pony Express agent. By May 1849, Egan was on his way west with 57 emigrants, the mail, six dogs, a cat and the printing press. By the first week in August, Egan's 22 wagons rumbled into Salt Lake Valley.}} </ref>\n|-\n| 1851\n|''[[The New York Times]]''\n| English\n| New York\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1851\n| ''[[Placerville Mountain Democrat]]''\n| English\n| [[Placerville, California]]\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1852\n|''[[The Wheeling Intelligencer]]''\n| English\n| [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1852\n|''[[The Casket]]''\n| English <br/>(Formerly [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]])\n| [[Antigonish, Nova Scotia]]\n| Canada\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1853\n| ''[[Guelph Mercury]]''\n| English\n| [[Guelph, Ontario]]\n| Canada\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1853\n| ''[[La Estrella de Panam\u00e1]]''\n| Spanish\n| [[Panam\u00e1]]\n| Panam\u00e1\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1854\n| ''[[The Union Democrat]]''\n| English\n| [[Sonora, California]]\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1854\n| ''[[The Daily Citizen (Searcy)|The Daily Citizen]]''\n| English\n| [[Searcy, Arkansas|Searcy]]\n| [[Arkansas]]\n| Still published<ref name=\"surreycomet.co.uk\"/>\n|-\n| 1857\n| ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]''\n| English\n| [[Sacramento, California]]\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1859\n| ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''\n| English\n| [[Denver, Colorado]]\n| United States\n| Published from 23 April 1859 to 27 February 2009.\n|-\n| 1861\n| ''[[Buenos Aires Standard]]''\n| English\n| [[Buenos Aires]]\n| [[Argentina]] \n| Defunct\n|-\n| 1862\n| ''[[Telegraph-Journal]]''\n| English\n| [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]\n| Canada\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1864\n| ''[[The Marietta Times]]''\n| English\n| [[Marietta, Ohio]]\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1865\n| ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]''\n| English\n| [[San Antonio, Texas]]\n| United States\n| Still Published\n|-\n| 1865\n| ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''\n| English\n| [[San Francisco]]\n| United States\n| Still Published\n|-\n| 1867\n| ''[[La Capital]]''\n| Spanish\n| [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]\n| [[Argentina]] \n| Still published.

That summer Phelps borrowed $61 from Alexander Badlam, Sam Brannan's brother-in-law, to purchase a Ramage press in Boston. Buying a press, type and newsprint was one thing, but hauling it 1,100 miles from the Missouri River was another. To do the job, the Mormons turned to Howard Egan, a veteran frontiersman and future Pony Express agent. By May 1849, Egan was on his way west with 57 emigrants, the mail, six dogs, a cat and the printing press. By the first week in August, Egan's 22 wagons rumbled into Salt Lake Valley.}} </ref>\n|-\n| 1851\n|''[[The New York Times]]''\n| English\n| New York\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1851\n| ''[[Placerville Mountain Democrat]]''\n| English\n| [[Placerville, California]]\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1852\n|''[[The Wheeling Intelligencer]]''\n| English\n| [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1852\n|''[[The Casket]]''\n| English <br/>(Formerly [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]])\n| [[Antigonish, Nova Scotia]]\n| Canada\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1853\n| ''[[Guelph Mercury]]''\n| English\n| [[Guelph, Ontario]]\n| Canada\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1853\n| ''[[La Estrella de Panam\u00e1]]''\n| Spanish\n| [[Panam\u00e1]]\n| Panam\u00e1\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1854\n| ''[[The Union Democrat]]''\n| English\n| [[Sonora, California]]\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1854\n| ''[[The Daily Citizen (Searcy)|The Daily Citizen]]''\n| English\n| [[Searcy, Arkansas|Searcy]]\n| [[Arkansas]]\n| Still published<ref name=\"surreycomet.co.uk\"/>\n|-\n| 1857\n| ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]''\n| English\n| [[Sacramento, California]]\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1859\n| ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]''\n| English\n| [[Denver, Colorado]]\n| United States\n| Published from 23 April 1859 to 27 February 2009.\n|-\n| 1861\n| ''[[Buenos Aires Standard]]''\n| English\n| [[Buenos Aires]]\n| [[Argentina]] \n| Defunct\n|-\n| 1862\n| ''[[Telegraph-Journal]]''\n| English\n| [[Saint John, New Brunswick]]\n| Canada\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1864\n| ''[[The Marietta Times]]''\n| English\n| [[Marietta, Ohio]]\n| United States\n| Still published\n|-\n| 1865\n| ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]''\n| English\n| [[San Antonio, Texas]]\n| United States\n| Still Published\n|-\n| 1865\n| ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''\n| English\n| [[San Francisco]]\n| United States\n| Still Published\n|-\n| 1867\n| ''[[La Capital]]''\n| Spanish\n| [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]\n| [[Argentina]] \n| Still published.

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n|headline = ''3.15.20'' track listing\n| title1 = 0.00 (We Are)\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.

No, as in life, there's beauty in uncertainty.\" While praising Glover's songwriting and the features on ''3.15.20'', Jones criticized the production and vocals on a few of the album's tracks.<ref name=\"COS\"/> ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s reviewer Dean Van Nguyen acclaimed the album, saying that \"The actor, comedian and musician Donald Glover has made the first truly outstanding album of the decade, offsetting cultural examinations with moments of sweet levity.\" Nguyen further stated that the themes of the album fits to the present day insecurities with the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], saying that \"The disruption caused by the coronavirus forces us to question how strong the foundations of civilisation really are. Glover never could have seen the pandemic coming when he was recording the album, yet at a time when much of what we thought was strong is weak - what we thought was eternal is potentially fleeting \u2013 ''3.15.20'' captures the insecurity of lived reality and the humanity that truly defines our existence.\"<ref name=\"Nguyen\"/> Sam Moore of ''[[NME]]'' gave the album a favorable review, particularly praising Glover's decision to bring up more private matters on the album, referring to the song \"47.48\". Moore wrote that \"The rolling groove of '47.48' is another highlight: Glovers doomy proclamations about the violent and unjust aspects of society ('little boys playing 'round, shot down') eventually subside for a more optimistic outlook for the future as Glover sweetly interacts with his young son Legend about the people they each love.\" Moore continued by saying that \"Glover\u2019s willingness to share such a candid moment on record is particularly interesting given his past proclivity towards keeping his private life largely offline, and may be a sign that the star is beginning to let his guard down as the outside world continues to try to peer in.\"<ref name=\"NME\"/>\n\nSome reviews were more mixed. Debbie Ijaduola of [[Clash (magazine)|''Clash'']] unfavorably compared the album to Childish Gambino's previous efforts, stating that \"Lacking the strong narrative thrust so apparent on his [Glover's] past albums, the project is incredibly disappointing. From what it looks like, it seems like there was a reason he said he was quitting music.\" However, Ijaduola highlighted the songs \"Algorhythm\", \"42.26\" and \"47.48\" as the album's most enjoyable tracks.<ref name=\"Clash\"/> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''{{'}}s critic Paul A. Thompson stated that \"''3.15.20'' is studded with little hooks and big ideas that serve as lures. Its spiritual largesse is weighed down by impulses carried halfway to their endpoints and moments of frustrating pretense.\" Thompson, alike other reviewers, praised the song \"47.48\", saying that the track \"sounds like a locked-in house band; the lyrics are actually about a crushing and ever-present violence, and the tension mesmerizes. That song ends with a conversation between Glover and his young son about love-sweeter than it sounds on paper, chilling given the juxtaposition.\"<ref name=\"PF\"/>\n\n== Track listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| extra_column = Producer(s)\n| total_length = 57:44\n|headline = ''3.15.20'' track listing\n| title1 = 0.00 (We Are)\n| writer1 = {{hlist|[[Donald Glover]]|[[James Francies|James Francies, Jr.]]|Denise Renee}}\n| extra1 = D.
