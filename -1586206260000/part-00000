The Navy also heads the [[Indonesian Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].\n\nAll commissioned ships of the TNI-AL have the prefix ''KRI'', standing for ''Kapal Republik Indonesia'' (''Republic of Indonesia Ship'').\n\n==Mission==\nAccording to Article 9 of Law No.34/2004 on the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|National Armed Forces]], the Navy has the following tasks:<ref>{{cite act|url=http://www.dpr.go.id/dokblog/dokumen/F_20150616_4760.PDF|title=UU No. 34 Tahun 2004 tentang Tentara Nasional Indonesia|trans-title=Law No. 34/2004 on National Armed Forces|index=34|year=2004}}</ref>\n# perform military duties in national defence;\n# enforce the law and secure the order in the sea area of national jurisdiction in accordance with national laws and ratified international laws;\n# perform diplomatic duties in support of foreign policy set by the government;\n# engage other duties relevant for the maintenance and development of naval power;\n# support civilian empowerment in sea defence areas.\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation and actions during the revolution===\nThe official Indonesian Navy's history began on 10 September 1945, at the outset of the [[Indonesian National Revolution]]. The administration of the early Indonesian government established the People's Marine Security Agency (''Badan Keamanan Rakyat Laut/ [[:id:Badan Keamanan Rakyat|BKR]] Laut'') on 22 August 1945, the predecessor to the modern Indonesian Navy. BKR Laut with only wooden ships, a few landing craft and weapons left by Japan,  was initially composed of Indonesian sailors who had served in the ranks of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] during the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial period]], and who had fought the Japanese during the years of [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|military occupation]], plus active militias who served with the Japanese and ex-Indonesian officers and ratings of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The formation of the Indonesian military organisation known as the People's Security Army (''Tentara Keamanan Rakyat / TKR'') on 5 October 1945, at the height of the National Revolution, helped spur the further existence of the TKR Naval Branch \u2013 the Peoples' Security Navy (''TLKR''), which later became the Republic of Indonesia Navy (''Angkatan Laut Republik Indonesia''/ ALRI). The name ALRI was used until 1970, when it was changed to ''Tentara Nasional Indonesia Angkatan Laut'' (TNI-AL).\n\nAs the revolution grew and the Navy began its work, naval bases were established throughout the archipelago. Former ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy handed down to the new republic were acquired. Simple strength did not discourage the Navy to deploy Sea Traffic Operations in order to spread the news of the proclamation and helping to form and train Republican military forces and militias nationwide. Besides, they also attempted to breach the Dutch naval blockade in order to obtain aid from abroad.\n\nThe newly formed navy confronted the more superior Royal Netherlands Navy in [[Bali]], [[Sibolga]] and [[Cirebon]]. Cross-sea operations are also able to prepare the armed forces in [[South Kalimantan]], [[Bali]] and [[Sulawesi]]. Limitations in strength and ability to lead the Navy had to divert the struggle in the countryside, after most boats were sunk and nearly all bases battered by the Dutch and Allied military forces. But the determination to participate again in the sea never subsided. In the hard times during the National Revolution the Navy succeeded in forming the Fleet Forces (CA), Marine Corps (''Corps Mariniers/ CM''), and educational institutions in various places. The formation of these elements mark the presence of aspects for the formation of a modern national navy.\n\n===After the revolution===\n[[File:Indonesian Navy Albatross UF-2, Jalesveva Jayamahe, p198.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grumman HU-16 Albatross]] of the naval aviation, 1950s\u20131960s]]\nThe end of the War of Independence marked the development of the Navy as a modern naval power. In accordance to the results of the [[Round Table Conference]], in 1949, the Navy received a variety of war equipment such as warships and its supporting facilities such as naval bases. This step in the consolidation of the body along with the Navy, revamping the organization and recruitment of personnel through educational institutions before manning naval equipment. During 1949\u20131959, the Indonesian Navy managed to enhance its strength and improve its capabilities. In the field of organization the navy reorganized its Fleet Forces, the Marine Corps \u2013 then ''Korps Komando Angkatan Laut'' (''KKO-AL'' \u2013 Naval Commando Corps Command), naval aviation and a number of regions as territorial defense command aspects of the sea. Navy combat equipment grew, both from the Dutch and from other various countries.\n\nWith the increased strength and the capability, the Navy began refining the strategy, tactics, and techniques of marine operations, which are directly applied in a variety of military operations in order to deal with separatist movements that have sprung up in the year from 1950 to 1959. In operations against PRRI in Sumatra, [[Permesta]] , [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] in West Java, and [[Republic of South Maluku|RMS]] in the [[Moluccas]], the Navy gained lessons in applying the concept of marine operations, amphibious operations, and joint operations with other forces.\n\n===At the height of the [[Cold War]]===\n[[File:Submarine Monument Surabaya 3.JPG|thumb|right|200px|KRI Pasopati, a [[Whiskey-class submarine]] which is now a museum ship]]\n[[File:RI Siliwangi, Jalesveva Jayamahe, p44.jpg|thumb|left|200px|KRI Siliwangi]]\n\nAt the time the country started to recover from the threat of disintegration, in 1959, the Navy launched a program known as ''Menuju Angkatan Laut yang Jaya'' (rough translation - \"Toward Distinguished Navy\"). The Navy experienced a significant progress until 1965 which was motivated by the politics of confrontation in order to seize [[West Irian]], which Indonesia claimed as part of its territory, a claim refuted by the Dutch government. As part of the increasing military ties between Indonesia and the [[Warsaw Pact]], various naval combat equipments from Eastern European countries strengthened the Navy and become the dominant force at the time. Some military equipment of Soviet production served in the ranks of the Navy, among others [[Sverdlov-class cruiser]], [[Skoryy-class destroyer]], [[Riga-class frigate]], [[Whiskey-class submarine]] (the first such vessels to be used in [[Southeast Asia]]), [[Komar-class missile boat]], [[Ilyushin Il-28]]  long-range bomber aircraft of Naval Aviation and the [[PT-76]] Amphibious light tanks, [[BTR-50]] APCs and BM-13 MRLs (Southeast Asia's first ever MRL system in service) of the Commando Corps, the first of their kind in the region. With such power in the era of the 1960s the Navy was called  the largest Navy in Southeast Asia and one of the strongest within the Asia-Pacific, outranking those of its neighbors in armament and prestige.\n\nBy January 1962 the Indonesian Navy started preparing a couple of naval operations for the liberation of [[West Irian]] known as [[Operation Trikora]], which began on 15 December the year before as part of the military component of that operation under the Mandala Command for the Liberation of West Irian (''Komando Mandala Pembebasan Irian Barat'') . Beginning 1 January, fast-ship torpedo vessels of the Navy were forward deployed to deal with destroyers, frigates and aircraft of the Royal Netherlands Navy. On January 15, 1962 Commodore [[Yos Sudarso]] along with RI Macan Tutul sank in the sea battle in the [[Arafura Sea]]. This battle is known as the [[Battle of Arafura Sea|Vlakke Hoek incident]].By mid-year the Navy was preparing to organize its role in the planned Operation Jayawijaya which would have been the largest amphibious operation in the history of Indonesian military operations if commenced. The naval component was made up of 100 warships and 16,000 sailors and Marines. The deployment of forces preparatory to the planned landings in West Papua forced the Dutch to return to negotiations and reached an agreement to hand over West Irian to Indonesia.\n\nAfter seizing West Irian, Sukarno by 1963 moved his sights on  [[Malaysia]]. Indonesia political confrontation against [[Neocolonialism]] and [[Imperialism]] (Nekolim) continued in Operation Dwikora to oppose the formation of Malaysia. Although elements of the National Armed Forces were prepared for operational deployments to the new state,  the operations were limited to the infiltration operation along the Borneo frontier. Soldiers from the marine corps were involved in the operations which targeted both the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. The Marine Corps, though, would figure in the 1964 [[MacDonald House bombing]] in Singapore.\n\n===1965 onwards===\n[[File:USS John R. Perry (DE-1034) underway in the Pacific Ocean, circa in 1971 (K-88514).jpg|thumb|{{USS|John R. Perry|DE-1034|6}}, a {{sclass-|Claud Jones|destroyer escort|1}} that would later become KRI ''Samadikun'']]\nOperation Dwikora was discontinued in 1965 along with a succession of governments in Indonesia after an abortive ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' <ref>\"The assassination of generals on the morning of 1 October was not really a coup attempt against the government, but the event has been almost universally described as an 'abortive coup attempt,' so I have continued to use the term.\" {{Harvnb|Crouch|1978|p=101|Ref=none}}.</ref> took place in [[Jakarta]], which were organized by the self-proclaimed organization of [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] members who, in the early hours of 1 October 1965, assassinated six [[Indonesian Army]] generals and killed 3 more. Since 1966, the Navy experienced a new chapter in its history as the military integration efforts. With the integration of the armed forces organizationally and operationally been able to keep up on the implementation of tasks in the field of defense and security so doctrinally, the direction of development of the power and capabilities of each branch to be concentrated. The operations were prominent during the period of the 1970s was [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Operation Seroja]] in the framework of the integration of [[East Timor]] to Indonesia. The Navy played an active role in the operation of landings, a joint ground operation, and transporting troops by sea.\n\nStarting the 1980s the Navy began to modernize combat equipment. Ships made in Eastern Europe that has been the core strength of the Navy in the era of the 1960s and 1970s were not suited to meet the growing and changing needs for the navy and its branches (saving for its submarines and several corvettes and frigates, the submarines were retired in 1990). The worsening relations between Indonesia and the [[Soviet Union]] after the government of President Sukarno resulted a cessation of military cooperation between the two countries and the Warsaw Pact. Therefore, the Navy switched once more to using Western technology to modernize the power and ability to buy warships, logistics vessels and other major combat equipment from various countries. Included among those commissioned during the [[Suharto]] presidency were [[KRI Fatahillah (361)|''Fatahillah''-class corvette]] and {{sclass-|Van Speijk|frigate}} from the [[Netherlands]], [[Type 209 submarine]] from [[West Germany]], fast patrol boat from [[South Korea]], and the [[GAF Nomad]] patrol aircraft from [[Australia]]. In 1993 the Navy also received 39 ships from the former ''[[Volksmarine]]'' (East German Navy), including 16 {{sclass2-|Parchim|corvette|1}}s, 14 Frosch-class landing ship tanks (LSTs), and 9 [[Project 89 Kondor Minesweeper|Kondor II-class minessweepers]]. Aside from these the Navy reorganized its forces. In 1984, as part of an-Armed Forces wide unit reorganization, the former Naval Regions, which in turn governed Naval Bases and Naval Districts and subordinate Naval Stations and Naval Air Stations, were turned into Main Naval Bases of the Navy Fleet Commands, divided from the formerly unified National Fleet Command.\n\n[[File:CutNyakDien.jpg|thumb|KRI ''Cut Nyak Dien'']]\nAt the same time the Navy began to develop a non-combat military operations in the form of humanitarian service program ''Surya Bhaskara Jaya'' in various remote areas in Indonesia that can only be reached by sea. The core of the operating activities are health services, construction and rehabilitation of public facilities and various counseling in health, law, and civil defense. This event is held regularly every year until now. A number of countries also participated in these activities, among others, Singapore, Australia and the United States. The navy also seeks promoting the development of the maritime sector, especially those related to aspects of defense and security at sea, activities that had been present since independence before the formation of the [[Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (Indonesia)|Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries]]. The actual activities undertaken today by the Navy are establishing marine development assessment bodies together with the government and private sectors in some areas, coastal village pilot programs are summarized in Coastal Rural Development (Bindesir), and the National Potential Development Program for Maritime Defense (Binpotnaskuatmar). In order to encourage the spirit of the seafaring nation, the Navy held an international scale maritime event  ''Arung Samudera'' 1995. The navy was responsible for the programs for National Maritime Year 1996 and the Bunaken Declaration of 1998, which is a manifestation of marine development in Indonesia.\n\n=== Expansion in the 21st century ===\nDuring the presidencies of [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] and [[Joko Widodo]], the Navy has begun a program of expansion of its combat commands and has begun a program of national warship construction in naval arsenals, while acquiring nationally produced transport aircraft for the needs of the Navy.\n\n== Organisation ==\n[[File:Kri makassar-590.PNG|thumb|right|KRI ''Makassar'' 590]]\nAccording to presidential decree No. 62/ 2016,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kemendagri.go.id/media/documents/2016/10/11/p/e/perpres_nomor_62_tahun_2016.pdf |title=Law |publisher=kemendagri.go.id |date=14 July 2016 |accessdate=9 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128052431/http://www.kemendagri.go.id/media/documents/2016/10/11/p/e/perpres_nomor_62_tahun_2016.pdf |archive-date=28 January 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the organizational structure of the navy comprises the following components:\n\n=== Leadership Elements===\n* [[Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Navy|Chief of Staff of the Navy]], position held by a four-star admiral or marine general.\n* [[:id:Wakil Kepala Staf TNI Angkatan Laut|Vice Chief of Staff of the Navy]], position held by a three-star admiral or marine general.\n\n=== Assistant for Leadership Element ===\n* Inspector General of the Navy, position held by two-star admiral.\n* Naval Expert Advisor, position held by two-star or one-star admiral.\n* Naval Planning and Budgeting Advisor\n* Naval Security Advisor\n* Naval Operation Advisor\n* Naval Human Resource Advisor\n* Naval Supply Advisor\n* Marine Potential Advisor\n\n=== Other Service Element as may be organized by the Chief of Staff of the Navy ===\n=== Central Executive Agencies ===\n[[File:Indonesian Naval Academy promotional recruiting poster.jpg|thumb|An [[Indonesian Naval Academy]] recruiting poster]]\n# Naval [[Security]] Service (''Dinas Keamanan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[Public affairs (military)|Public Relations]] and Media Directorate (''Dinas Penerangan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[Communication]] and [[Electronics]] Service (''Dinas Komunikasi dan Elektronika TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[Military justice|Legal Counsel]] Service (''Dinas Pembinaan Hukum TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Marine Potential Development Service (''Dinas Potensi Maritim TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Personnel Administration Service (''Dinas Administrasi Personal TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Education Service (''Dinas Pendidikan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Personnel Maintenance Service (''Dinas Perawatan Personel TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[Medicine|Medical]] Department (''Dinas Kesehatan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Ordnance Department (''Dinas Materiil TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[List of naval weapon systems|Weapons]] and Electronics Equipment Service (''Dinas Materiil Senjata dan Elektronika TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[Seakeeping|Seaworthiness]] Equipment Service (''Dinas Kelaikan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# [[Naval Base]] Facility Service (''Dinas Fasilitas Pangkalan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Procurement Service (''Dinas Pengadaan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Supply Corps(''Dinas Pembekalan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Finance Corps (''Dinas Keuangan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# [[Military science|Naval Research and Development]] Department (''Dinas Penelitian dan Pengembangan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Information and Data Processing Service (''Dinas Informasi dan Pengolahan Data TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Psychology Service (''Dinas Psikologi TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Operations and Training Command (''Dinas Operasi dan Latihan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# [[Indonesian Naval Aviation Command|Naval Aviation]] Command (''Pusat Penerbangan Angkatan Laut / Puspenerbal'')\n# [[Naval Military Police Corps (Indonesia)|Naval Military Police]] Command (''Pusat Polisi Militer TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# [[Indonesian Naval Academy]] Surabaya (''Akademi TNI Angkatan Laut/ AAL'')\n# Naval Command and Staff College (''Sekolah Staf dan Komando Angkatan Laut / Seskoal'')\n# Naval Technological College (''Sekolah Tinggi Teknologi TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n\n[[File:Bo 105 Indonesian navy Bo 105 helicopter during a deck landing on the USS Fort Worth (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[MBB Bo 105]] of the Naval Aviation landing on the&nbsp;[[flight deck]]&nbsp;of&nbsp;[[USS Fort Worth|USS&nbsp;''Fort Worth'']]]]\n\n==== Naval Aviation ====\nThe Naval Aviation Centre (Pusat Penerbangan Angkatan Laut - Puspenerbal) is a part of the Navy's Central Executive Agencies led by a Rear Admiral (upper half).

Puspenerbal is not just a combat unit, but also participates in various Marine Corps operational tasks as well as providing logistics and personnel tactical transport facilities for marine and airbase systems. In carrying out these tasks, Puspenerbal carries out flight functions which include: Air surveillance, anti-submarine, fast logistics support, maritime patrol, marine combat operations, and the provision of material coaching functions. This unit is in charge of supporting naval operations, both for combat operations, SAR operations and humanitarian relief operations. Marine security to monitor the movement of foreign ships, especially in the archipelagic sea lanes of Indonesia, environmental protection from the pollution of dangerous materials, the prevention of smuggling and theft of marine wealth is also an important mission carried by Dispenerbal, in cooperation with other air force elements such as TNI-AU and Police.

The Navy also heads the [[Indonesian Marine Corps|Marine Corps]].\n\nAll commissioned ships of the TNI-AL have the prefix ''KRI'', standing for ''Kapal Republik Indonesia'' (''Republic of Indonesia Ship'').\n\n==Mission==\nAccording to Article 9 of Law No.34/2004 on the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|National Armed Forces]], the Navy has the following tasks:<ref>{{cite act|url=http://www.dpr.go.id/dokblog/dokumen/F_20150616_4760.PDF|title=UU No. 34 Tahun 2004 tentang Tentara Nasional Indonesia|trans-title=Law No. 34/2004 on National Armed Forces|index=34|year=2004}}</ref>\n# perform military duties in national defence;\n# enforce the law and secure the order in the sea area of national jurisdiction in accordance with national laws and ratified international laws;\n# perform diplomatic duties in support of foreign policy set by the government;\n# engage other duties relevant for the maintenance and development of naval power;\n# support civilian empowerment in sea defence areas.\n\n==History==\n\n===Creation and actions during the revolution===\nThe official Indonesian Navy's history began on 10 September 1945, at the outset of the [[Indonesian National Revolution]]. The administration of the early Indonesian government established the People's Marine Security Agency (''Badan Keamanan Rakyat Laut/ [[:id:Badan Keamanan Rakyat|BKR]] Laut'') on 22 August 1945, the predecessor to the modern Indonesian Navy. BKR Laut with only wooden ships, a few landing craft and weapons left by Japan,  was initially composed of Indonesian sailors who had served in the ranks of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] during the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial period]], and who had fought the Japanese during the years of [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|military occupation]], plus active militias who served with the Japanese and ex-Indonesian officers and ratings of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. The formation of the Indonesian military organisation known as the People's Security Army (''Tentara Keamanan Rakyat / TKR'') on 5 October 1945, at the height of the National Revolution, helped spur the further existence of the TKR Naval Branch \u2013 the Peoples' Security Navy (''TLKR''), which later became the Republic of Indonesia Navy (''Angkatan Laut Republik Indonesia''/ ALRI). The name ALRI was used until 1970, when it was changed to ''Tentara Nasional Indonesia Angkatan Laut'' (TNI-AL).\n\nAs the revolution grew and the Navy began its work, naval bases were established throughout the archipelago. Former ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy handed down to the new republic were acquired. Simple strength did not discourage the Navy to deploy Sea Traffic Operations in order to spread the news of the proclamation and helping to form and train Republican military forces and militias nationwide. Besides, they also attempted to breach the Dutch naval blockade in order to obtain aid from abroad.\n\nThe newly formed navy confronted the more superior Royal Netherlands Navy in [[Bali]], [[Sibolga]] and [[Cirebon]]. Cross-sea operations are also able to prepare the armed forces in [[South Kalimantan]], [[Bali]] and [[Sulawesi]]. Limitations in strength and ability to lead the Navy had to divert the struggle in the countryside, after most boats were sunk and nearly all bases battered by the Dutch and Allied military forces. But the determination to participate again in the sea never subsided. In the hard times during the National Revolution the Navy succeeded in forming the Fleet Forces (CA), Marine Corps (''Corps Mariniers/ CM''), and educational institutions in various places. The formation of these elements mark the presence of aspects for the formation of a modern national navy.\n\n===After the revolution===\n[[File:Indonesian Navy Albatross UF-2, Jalesveva Jayamahe, p198.jpg|thumb|left|[[Grumman HU-16 Albatross]] of the naval aviation, 1950s\u20131960s]]\nThe end of the War of Independence marked the development of the Navy as a modern naval power. In accordance to the results of the [[Round Table Conference]], in 1949, the Navy received a variety of war equipment such as warships and its supporting facilities such as naval bases. This step in the consolidation of the body along with the Navy, revamping the organization and recruitment of personnel through educational institutions before manning naval equipment. During 1949\u20131959, the Indonesian Navy managed to enhance its strength and improve its capabilities. In the field of organization the navy reorganized its Fleet Forces, the Marine Corps \u2013 then ''Korps Komando Angkatan Laut'' (''KKO-AL'' \u2013 Naval Commando Corps Command), naval aviation and a number of regions as territorial defense command aspects of the sea. Navy combat equipment grew, both from the Dutch and from other various countries.\n\nWith the increased strength and the capability, the Navy began refining the strategy, tactics, and techniques of marine operations, which are directly applied in a variety of military operations in order to deal with separatist movements that have sprung up in the year from 1950 to 1959. In operations against PRRI in Sumatra, [[Permesta]] , [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] in West Java, and [[Republic of South Maluku|RMS]] in the [[Moluccas]], the Navy gained lessons in applying the concept of marine operations, amphibious operations, and joint operations with other forces.\n\n===At the height of the [[Cold War]]===\n[[File:Submarine Monument Surabaya 3.JPG|thumb|right|200px|KRI Pasopati, a [[Whiskey-class submarine]] which is now a museum ship]]\n[[File:RI Siliwangi, Jalesveva Jayamahe, p44.jpg|thumb|left|200px|KRI Siliwangi]]\n\nAt the time the country started to recover from the threat of disintegration, in 1959, the Navy launched a program known as ''Menuju Angkatan Laut yang Jaya'' (rough translation - \"Toward Distinguished Navy\"). The Navy experienced a significant progress until 1965 which was motivated by the politics of confrontation in order to seize [[West Irian]], which Indonesia claimed as part of its territory, a claim refuted by the Dutch government. As part of the increasing military ties between Indonesia and the [[Warsaw Pact]], various naval combat equipments from Eastern European countries strengthened the Navy and become the dominant force at the time. Some military equipment of Soviet production served in the ranks of the Navy, among others [[Sverdlov-class cruiser]], [[Skoryy-class destroyer]], [[Riga-class frigate]], [[Whiskey-class submarine]] (the first such vessels to be used in [[Southeast Asia]]), [[Komar-class missile boat]], [[Ilyushin Il-28]]  long-range bomber aircraft of Naval Aviation and the [[PT-76]] Amphibious light tanks, [[BTR-50]] APCs and BM-13 MRLs (Southeast Asia's first ever MRL system in service) of the Commando Corps, the first of their kind in the region. With such power in the era of the 1960s the Navy was called  the largest Navy in Southeast Asia and one of the strongest within the Asia-Pacific, outranking those of its neighbors in armament and prestige.\n\nBy January 1962 the Indonesian Navy started preparing a couple of naval operations for the liberation of [[West Irian]] known as [[Operation Trikora]], which began on 15 December the year before as part of the military component of that operation under the Mandala Command for the Liberation of West Irian (''Komando Mandala Pembebasan Irian Barat'') . Beginning 1 January, fast-ship torpedo vessels of the Navy were forward deployed to deal with destroyers, frigates and aircraft of the Royal Netherlands Navy. On January 15, 1962 Commodore [[Yos Sudarso]] along with RI Macan Tutul sank in the sea battle in the [[Arafura Sea]]. This battle is known as the [[Battle of Arafura Sea|Vlakke Hoek incident]].By mid-year the Navy was preparing to organize its role in the planned Operation Jayawijaya which would have been the largest amphibious operation in the history of Indonesian military operations if commenced. The naval component was made up of 100 warships and 16,000 sailors and Marines. The deployment of forces preparatory to the planned landings in West Papua forced the Dutch to return to negotiations and reached an agreement to hand over West Irian to Indonesia.\n\nAfter seizing West Irian, Sukarno by 1963 moved his sights on  [[Malaysia]]. Indonesia political confrontation against [[Neocolonialism]] and [[Imperialism]] (Nekolim) continued in Operation Dwikora to oppose the formation of Malaysia. Although elements of the National Armed Forces were prepared for operational deployments to the new state,  the operations were limited to the infiltration operation along the Borneo frontier. Soldiers from the marine corps were involved in the operations which targeted both the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. The Marine Corps, though, would figure in the 1964 [[MacDonald House bombing]] in Singapore.\n\n===1965 onwards===\n[[File:USS John R. Perry (DE-1034) underway in the Pacific Ocean, circa in 1971 (K-88514).jpg|thumb|{{USS|John R. Perry|DE-1034|6}}, a {{sclass-|Claud Jones|destroyer escort|1}} that would later become KRI ''Samadikun'']]\nOperation Dwikora was discontinued in 1965 along with a succession of governments in Indonesia after an abortive ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'' <ref>\"The assassination of generals on the morning of 1 October was not really a coup attempt against the government, but the event has been almost universally described as an 'abortive coup attempt,' so I have continued to use the term.\" {{Harvnb|Crouch|1978|p=101|Ref=none}}.</ref> took place in [[Jakarta]], which were organized by the self-proclaimed organization of [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] members who, in the early hours of 1 October 1965, assassinated six [[Indonesian Army]] generals and killed 3 more. Since 1966, the Navy experienced a new chapter in its history as the military integration efforts. With the integration of the armed forces organizationally and operationally been able to keep up on the implementation of tasks in the field of defense and security so doctrinally, the direction of development of the power and capabilities of each branch to be concentrated. The operations were prominent during the period of the 1970s was [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Operation Seroja]] in the framework of the integration of [[East Timor]] to Indonesia. The Navy played an active role in the operation of landings, a joint ground operation, and transporting troops by sea.\n\nStarting the 1980s the Navy began to modernize combat equipment. Ships made in Eastern Europe that has been the core strength of the Navy in the era of the 1960s and 1970s were not suited to meet the growing and changing needs for the navy and its branches (saving for its submarines and several corvettes and frigates, the submarines were retired in 1990). The worsening relations between Indonesia and the [[Soviet Union]] after the government of President Sukarno resulted a cessation of military cooperation between the two countries and the Warsaw Pact. Therefore, the Navy switched once more to using Western technology to modernize the power and ability to buy warships, logistics vessels and other major combat equipment from various countries. Included among those commissioned during the [[Suharto]] presidency were [[KRI Fatahillah (361)|''Fatahillah''-class corvette]] and {{sclass-|Van Speijk|frigate}} from the [[Netherlands]], [[Type 209 submarine]] from [[West Germany]], fast patrol boat from [[South Korea]], and the [[GAF Nomad]] patrol aircraft from [[Australia]]. In 1993 the Navy also received 39 ships from the former ''[[Volksmarine]]'' (East German Navy), including 16 {{sclass2-|Parchim|corvette|1}}s, 14 Frosch-class landing ship tanks (LSTs), and 9 [[Project 89 Kondor Minesweeper|Kondor II-class minessweepers]]. Aside from these the Navy reorganized its forces. In 1984, as part of an-Armed Forces wide unit reorganization, the former Naval Regions, which in turn governed Naval Bases and Naval Districts and subordinate Naval Stations and Naval Air Stations, were turned into Main Naval Bases of the Navy Fleet Commands, divided from the formerly unified National Fleet Command.\n\n[[File:CutNyakDien.jpg|thumb|KRI ''Cut Nyak Dien'']]\nAt the same time the Navy began to develop a non-combat military operations in the form of humanitarian service program ''Surya Bhaskara Jaya'' in various remote areas in Indonesia that can only be reached by sea. The core of the operating activities are health services, construction and rehabilitation of public facilities and various counseling in health, law, and civil defense. This event is held regularly every year until now. A number of countries also participated in these activities, among others, Singapore, Australia and the United States. The navy also seeks promoting the development of the maritime sector, especially those related to aspects of defense and security at sea, activities that had been present since independence before the formation of the [[Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries (Indonesia)|Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries]]. The actual activities undertaken today by the Navy are establishing marine development assessment bodies together with the government and private sectors in some areas, coastal village pilot programs are summarized in Coastal Rural Development (Bindesir), and the National Potential Development Program for Maritime Defense (Binpotnaskuatmar). In order to encourage the spirit of the seafaring nation, the Navy held an international scale maritime event  ''Arung Samudera'' 1995. The navy was responsible for the programs for National Maritime Year 1996 and the Bunaken Declaration of 1998, which is a manifestation of marine development in Indonesia.\n\n=== Expansion in the 21st century ===\nDuring the presidencies of [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]] and [[Joko Widodo]], the Navy has begun a program of expansion of its combat commands and has begun a program of national warship construction in naval arsenals, while acquiring nationally produced transport aircraft for the needs of the Navy.\n\n== Organisation ==\n[[File:Kri makassar-590.PNG|thumb|right|KRI ''Makassar'' 590]]\nAccording to presidential decree No. 62/ 2016,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kemendagri.go.id/media/documents/2016/10/11/p/e/perpres_nomor_62_tahun_2016.pdf |title=Law |publisher=kemendagri.go.id |date=14 July 2016 |accessdate=9 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180128052431/http://www.kemendagri.go.id/media/documents/2016/10/11/p/e/perpres_nomor_62_tahun_2016.pdf |archive-date=28 January 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the organizational structure of the navy comprises the following components:\n\n=== Leadership Elements===\n* [[Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Navy|Chief of Staff of the Navy]], position held by a four-star admiral or marine general.\n* [[:id:Wakil Kepala Staf TNI Angkatan Laut|Vice Chief of Staff of the Navy]], position held by a three-star admiral or marine general.\n\n=== Assistant for Leadership Element ===\n* Inspector General of the Navy, position held by two-star admiral.\n* Naval Expert Advisor, position held by two-star or one-star admiral.\n* Naval Planning and Budgeting Advisor\n* Naval Security Advisor\n* Naval Operation Advisor\n* Naval Human Resource Advisor\n* Naval Supply Advisor\n* Marine Potential Advisor\n\n=== Other Service Element as may be organized by the Chief of Staff of the Navy ===\n=== Central Executive Agencies ===\n[[File:Indonesian Naval Academy promotional recruiting poster.jpg|thumb|An [[Indonesian Naval Academy]] recruiting poster]]\n# Naval [[Security]] Service (''Dinas Keamanan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[Public affairs (military)|Public Relations]] and Media Directorate (''Dinas Penerangan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[Communication]] and [[Electronics]] Service (''Dinas Komunikasi dan Elektronika TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[Military justice|Legal Counsel]] Service (''Dinas Pembinaan Hukum TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Marine Potential Development Service (''Dinas Potensi Maritim TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Personnel Administration Service (''Dinas Administrasi Personal TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Education Service (''Dinas Pendidikan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Personnel Maintenance Service (''Dinas Perawatan Personel TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[Medicine|Medical]] Department (''Dinas Kesehatan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Ordnance Department (''Dinas Materiil TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[List of naval weapon systems|Weapons]] and Electronics Equipment Service (''Dinas Materiil Senjata dan Elektronika TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval [[Seakeeping|Seaworthiness]] Equipment Service (''Dinas Kelaikan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# [[Naval Base]] Facility Service (''Dinas Fasilitas Pangkalan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Procurement Service (''Dinas Pengadaan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Supply Corps(''Dinas Pembekalan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Finance Corps (''Dinas Keuangan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# [[Military science|Naval Research and Development]] Department (''Dinas Penelitian dan Pengembangan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Information and Data Processing Service (''Dinas Informasi dan Pengolahan Data TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Psychology Service (''Dinas Psikologi TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# Naval Operations and Training Command (''Dinas Operasi dan Latihan TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# [[Indonesian Naval Aviation Command|Naval Aviation]] Command (''Pusat Penerbangan Angkatan Laut / Puspenerbal'')\n# [[Naval Military Police Corps (Indonesia)|Naval Military Police]] Command (''Pusat Polisi Militer TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n# [[Indonesian Naval Academy]] Surabaya (''Akademi TNI Angkatan Laut/ AAL'')\n# Naval Command and Staff College (''Sekolah Staf dan Komando Angkatan Laut / Seskoal'')\n# Naval Technological College (''Sekolah Tinggi Teknologi TNI Angkatan Laut'')\n\n[[File:Bo 105 Indonesian navy Bo 105 helicopter during a deck landing on the USS Fort Worth (cropped).jpg|thumb|[[MBB Bo 105]] of the Naval Aviation landing on the&nbsp;[[flight deck]]&nbsp;of&nbsp;[[USS Fort Worth|USS&nbsp;''Fort Worth'']]]]\n\n==== Naval Aviation ====\nThe Naval Aviation Centre (Pusat Penerbangan Angkatan Laut - Puspenerbal) is a part of the Navy's Central Executive Agencies led by a Rear Admiral (upper half).

Puspenerbal is not just a combat unit, but also participates in various Marine Corps operational tasks as well as providing logistics and personnel tactical transport facilities for marine and airbase systems. In carrying out these tasks, Puspenerbal carries out flight functions which include: Air surveillance, anti-submarine, fast logistics support, maritime patrol, marine combat operations, and the provision of material coaching functions. This unit is in charge of supporting naval operations, both for combat operations, SAR operations and humanitarian relief operations. Marine security to monitor the movement of foreign ships, especially in the archipelagic sea lanes of Indonesia, environmental protection from the pollution of dangerous materials, the prevention of smuggling and theft of marine wealth is also an important mission carried by Dispenerbal, in cooperation with other air force elements such as TNI-AU and Police.

They had also considered the mode of election of the executive but had not reached consensus. This all changed on September 4, when the committee recommended that the nation's chief executive be elected by an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], with each [[U.S. state|state]] having a number of presidential electors equal to the sum of that state's allocation of [[United States House of Representatives|representatives]] and [[United States Senate|senators]].<ref name=Garvey/><ref name=RA2005TLR>{{cite journal|last=Albert|first=Richard|title=The Evolving Vice Presidency|journal=Temple Law Review|date=Winter 2005|volume=78|issue=4|url=https://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1624&context=lsfp|pages=811\u2013896|publisher=Temple University of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=July 29, 2018|via=Digital Commons @ Boston College Law School}}</ref>\n\nThe proposed presidential election process called for each state to choose members of the electoral college, who would use their discretion to select the candidates they individually viewed as best qualified.<ref>{{cite web|last=Holcombe|first=Randall G.|title=Origins of the Electoral College|url=https://mises.org/library/origins-electoral-college|date=November 9, 2000|work=Mises Daily|publisher=[[Mises Institute]]|location=Auburn, Alabama|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref> Recognizing that loyalty to one's individual state outweighed loyalty to the new federation, the Constitution's framers assumed individual electors would be inclined to choose a candidate from their own state (a so-called \"[[favorite son]]\" candidate) over one from another state.

In the [[1796 United States presidential election|election of 1796]], [[Federalist Party|Federalist]] [[John Adams]] won the presidency, but his bitter rival, [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] came second and became vice president. Thus, the president and vice president were from opposing parties; and Jefferson used the vice presidency to frustrate the president's policies.

Eisenhower]] openly addressed his health issues and made it a point to enter into an agreement with Vice President Richard Nixon that provided for Nixon to act on his behalf in the event that Eisenhower became unable to provide effective presidential leadership (Nixon did informally assume some of the president's duties for several weeks on each of three occasions when Eisenhower was ill), discussions began in Congress about clearing up the Constitution's ambiguity on the subject.<ref name=FordhamLaw2011/><ref name=NCC25th>{{cite web| title=The Twenty-fifth Amendment| last1=Kalt| first1=Brian C.| last2=Pozen| first2=David| url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxv| work=The Interactive Constitution| publisher=The National Constitution Center| location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania| accessdate=July 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nSections 3 and 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provide for situations where the president is temporarily unable to lead, such as if the president has a surgical procedure, becomes seriously ill or injured, or is otherwise unable to discharge the powers or duties of the presidency.

The influence of the vice president in this role depends almost entirely on the characteristics of the particular administration. Dick Cheney, for instance, was widely regarded as one of President George W. Bush's closest confidants. Al Gore was an important adviser to President [[Bill Clinton]] on matters of [[foreign policy]] and the [[environmental policy|environment]].\n\nUnder the American [[Presidential system|system of government]] the president is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Government: The Executive Branch|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-executive-branch/|website=whitehouse.gov|publisher=The White House|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=July 31, 2018}}</ref> and the ceremonial duties of the former position are often delegated to the vice president. The vice president will on occasion represent the president and the U.S. government at state funerals abroad, or at various events in the United States. This often is the most visible role of the vice president. The vice president may also meet with other heads of state at times when the administration wishes to demonstrate concern or support but cannot send the president personally.\n\n==Selection process==\n===Eligibility===\n\n[[File:Johnadamsvp.flipped.jpg|thumb|[[John Adams]], the first vice president of the United States]]\n\nTo be Constitutionally eligible to serve as the nation's vice president, a person must, according to the Twelfth Amendment, meet the eligibility requirements to become president (which are stated in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article II, Section 1, Clause 5]]). Thus, to serve as vice president, an individual must:\n* be a [[Natural-born citizen|natural-born]] [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizen]];\n* be at least 35 years old;\n* be a [[Residency (domicile)#United States|resident in the U.S.]] for at least 14 years.<ref name=AC-XII>{{cite web|title=Twelfth Amendment|url=http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/page/twelfth-amendment|work=Annenberg Classroom|publisher=The Annenberg Public Policy Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA person who meets the above qualifications is still disqualified from holding the office of vice president under the following conditions:\n* Under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction|Article I, Section 3, Clause 7]], upon conviction in impeachment cases, the Senate has the option of disqualifying convicted individuals from holding federal office, including that of vice president;\n* Under [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion|Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment]], no person who has sworn an oath to support the Constitution, who has later gone to war against the United States, or given aid and comfort to the nation's enemies can serve in a state or federal office\u2014including as vice president.

The vice presidential candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party's quadrennial nominating convention, following the selection of the party's presidential candidate. The official process is identical to the one by which the presidential candidates are chosen, with delegates placing the names of candidates into nomination, followed by a ballot in which candidates must receive a majority to secure the party's nomination.\n\nIn practice, the presidential nominee has considerable influence on the decision, and in the 20th century it became customary for that person to select a preferred running mate, who is then nominated and accepted by the convention. In recent years, with the presidential nomination usually being a foregone conclusion as the result of the primary process, the selection of a vice presidential candidate is often announced prior to the actual balloting for the presidential candidate, and sometimes before the beginning of the convention itself. The first presidential aspirant to announce his selection for vice president before the beginning of the convention was [[Ronald Reagan]] who, prior to the [[1976 Republican National Convention]] announced that [[Richard Schweiker]] would be his running mate. Reagan's supporters then sought to amend the convention rules so that [[Gerald R. Ford]] would be required to name his vice presidential running mate in advance as well. The proposal was defeated, and Reagan did not receive the nomination in 1976. Often, the presidential nominee will name a vice presidential candidate who will bring geographic or ideological balance to the ticket or appeal to a particular constituency.\n\nThe vice presidential candidate might also be chosen on the basis of traits the presidential candidate is perceived to lack, or on the basis of name recognition. To foster party unity, popular runners-up in the presidential nomination process are commonly considered. While this selection process may enhance the chances of success for a national ticket, in the past it often insured that the vice presidential nominee represented regions, constituencies, or ideologies at odds with those of the presidential candidate. As a result, vice presidents were often excluded from the policy-making process of the new administration. Many times their relationships with the president and his staff were aloof, non-existent, or even adversarial.\n\nThe ultimate goal of vice presidential candidate selection is to help and not hurt the party's chances of getting elected; nonetheless, several vice presidential selections have been controversial. In 1984, Democratic nominee [[Walter Mondale]]'s groundbreaking choice of [[Geraldine Ferraro]] as his running mate (the first woman in U.S. history nominated for vice president by a major political party), became a drag on the ticket due to repeated questions about her husband's finances. A selection whose positive traits make the presidential candidate look less favorable in comparison or which can cause the presidential candidate's judgment to be questioned often backfire, such as in 1988 when Democratic candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] chose experienced Texas Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]]; Bentsen was considered a more seasoned statesman in federal politics and somewhat overshadowed Dukakis. Questions about [[Dan Quayle]]'s experience were raised in the 1988 presidential campaign of [[George H. W. Bush]], but the Bush\u2013Quayle ticket still won handily. [[James Stockdale]], the choice of third-party candidate [[Ross Perot]] in 1992, was seen as unqualified by many and Stockdale had little preparation for the vice presidential debate, but the Perot\u2013Stockdale ticket still won about 19% of the vote. In 2008, Republican [[John McCain]] chose [[Sarah Palin]] as his running mate over his primary rivals and/or campaign surrogates such as [[Mitt Romney]] or [[Tom Ridge]]. This surprise move would, it was hoped, draw women voters disappointed by [[Hillary Clinton]]'s defeat in the Democratic presidential primaries into the McCain camp. Palin's selection soon came to be seen as a negative for McCain, due to her several controversies during her gubernatorial tenure which were highlighted by the press, and her feuding with McCain campaign chairman [[Steve Schmidt]]. This perception continued to grow throughout the campaign, especially after [[Sarah Palin interviews with Katie Couric|her interviews with Katie Couric]] led to concerns about her fitness for the presidency.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |authorlink=Adam Nagourney |title=Concerns About Palin's Readiness as Big Test Nears |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 30, 2008 |page=A16 |url=http://www.newyorktimes.com/2008/09/30/us/politics/30palin.htm |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, vice presidential candidates were chosen to provide geographic and ideological balance to a presidential ticket, widening a presidential candidate's appeal to voters from outside their regional base or wing of the party. Candidates from electoral-vote rich states were usually preferred. However, in 1992, moderate Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] (of [[Arkansas]]) chose moderate Democrat [[Al Gore]] (of [[Tennessee]]) as his running mate. Despite the two candidates' near-identical ideological and regional backgrounds, Gore's extensive experience in national affairs enhanced the appeal of a ticket headed by Clinton, whose political career had been spent entirely at the local and state levels of government. In 2000, [[George W. Bush]] chose [[Dick Cheney]] of [[Wyoming]], a reliably Republican state with only three electoral votes, and in 2008, [[Barack Obama]] mirrored Bush's strategy when he chose [[Joe Biden]] of [[Delaware]], a reliably Democratic state, likewise one with only three electoral votes. Both Cheney and Biden were chosen for their experience in national politics (experience lacked by both Bush and Obama) rather than the ideological balance or electoral vote advantage they would provide.\n\nPrior to the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]], both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney lived in and voted in Texas. While nothing in the Constitution prohibits a presidential candidate and his or her running mate being from the same state, the \"inhabitant clause\" of the Twelfth Amendment does mandate that every presidential elector must cast a ballot for at least one candidate who is not from their own state. To avoid creating a potential problem for Texas' electors, Cheney changed his residency back to Wyoming prior to the campaign.<ref name=AC-XII/>\n\nThe first presidential candidate to choose his vice presidential candidate was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940.<ref name=\"sigelman\">[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2952169 The \"Veepstakes\": Strategic Choice in Presidential Running Mate Selection], by Lee Sigelman and Paul J. Wahlbeck, American Political Science Review, December 1997</ref> The last not to name a vice presidential choice, leaving the matter up to the convention, was [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in 1956. The convention chose [[Tennessee]] Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] over [[Massachusetts]] Senator (and later president) [[John F. Kennedy]]. At the tumultuous 1972 Democratic convention, presidential nominee [[George McGovern]] selected Senator [[Thomas Eagleton]] as his running mate, but numerous other candidates were either nominated from the floor or received votes during the balloting. Eagleton nevertheless received a majority of the votes and the nomination, though he later resigned from the ticket, resulting in [[Sargent Shriver]] becoming McGovern's final running mate; both lost to the Nixon\u2013Agnew ticket by a wide margin, carrying only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn cases where the presidential nomination is still in doubt as the convention approaches, the campaigns for the two positions may become intertwined. In 1976, [[Ronald Reagan]], who was trailing President [[Gerald R. Ford]] in the presidential delegate count, announced prior to the Republican National Convention that, if nominated, he would select Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] as his running mate. This move backfired to a degree, as Schweiker's relatively liberal voting record alienated many of the more conservative delegates who were considering a challenge to party delegate selection rules to improve Reagan's chances.

I'm running for president of the United States of America\" while noting \"With all due respect. I won twice as many states as Senator Clinton. I've won more of the popular vote than Senator Clinton.

In 1923, the residence was reassigned to be the home of the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] (CNO), which it was until it was turned over to the office of the vice president fifty years later.\n\n==Office as stepping stone to the presidency==\n\nIn addition to the nine vice presidents who succeeded to the presidency intra-term (four of whom subsequently won election to a full term), five became president after serving one or more full terms as vice president, namely: John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Martin Van Buren, Richard Nixon, and George H. W. Bush. Of these, all but Nixon went directly from one office to the other.\n\nIn recent decades, the vice presidency has frequently been used as a platform to launch bids for the presidency. The transition of the office to its modern stature occurred primarily as a result of Franklin Roosevelt's 1940 nomination, when he captured the ability to nominate his running mate instead of leaving the nomination to the convention. Prior to that, party bosses often used the vice presidential nomination as a consolation prize for the party's minority faction. A further factor potentially contributing to the rise in prestige of the office was the adoption of presidential preference primaries in the early 20th century. By adopting primary voting, the field of candidates for vice president was expanded by both the increased quantity and quality of presidential candidates successful in some primaries, yet who ultimately failed to capture the presidential nomination at the convention.\n\nOf the thirteen presidential elections from 1956 to 2004, nine featured the incumbent president; the other four ([[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988]], [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]]) all featured the incumbent vice president. Former vice presidents also ran in [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984]] ([[Walter Mondale]]) and in 1968 ([[Richard Nixon]], against the incumbent vice president, [[Hubert Humphrey]]). The presidential election of 2008 was the first since 1928 that saw neither an incumbent president nor an incumbent or former vice president take part in any primary or general election for the presidency on a major party ticket. Nixon is the only vice president to have been elected president while not an incumbent, as well as the only person elected twice to the presidency ''and'' twice to the vice presidency.\n\n==Vacancies==\n\n[[File:Mr. and Mrs. Ford and Nixon 13&nbsp;Oct&nbsp;1973.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Two women are flanked by two men in suits, standing in a room of the White House.|(Left to right) President [[Richard Nixon]], First Lady [[Pat Nixon]], [[Betty Ford]] and Congressman [[Gerald Ford]] after President Nixon nominated Congressman Ford to be vice president, October 13, 1973]]\n\nPrior to the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency. \n\nAs a result, when one occurred, the office was left vacant until filled through the next ensuing election and inauguration. Between 1812 and 1965, the vice presidency was vacant on sixteen occasions, as a result of seven deaths, one resignation, and eight cases of the vice president succeeding to the presidency. With the vacancy that followed the succession of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1963, the nation had been without a vice president for a cumulative total of 37 years.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Feerick| first=John D.| title=The Vice-Presidency and the Problems of Presidential Succession and Inability| journal=Fordham Law Review| year=1964| volume=31| issue=3| publisher=Fordham University School of Law| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol32/iss3/2| pages=457\u2013498| accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref><ref name=succesionfacts>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/us/succession-presidential-and-vice-presidential-fast-facts/|title=Succession: Presidential and Vice Presidential Fast Facts|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=September 26, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSection 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provides that, \"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.\"<ref name=XXVHeritage/> This procedure has been implemented twice since the amendment [[Coming into force|came into force]]: the first instance occurred in 1973 following the October 10 resignation of [[Spiro Agnew]], when [[Gerald Ford]] was nominated by President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[United States vice presidential selection, 1973|confirmed by Congress]].

Ironically, both the presidents making the offer to Webster died in office, meaning the three-time candidate would have become president had he accepted either. Since presidents rarely die in office, however, the better preparation for the presidency was considered to be the office of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], in which Webster served under Harrison, Tyler, and later, Taylor's successor, Fillmore.\n\nIn the first hundred years of the United States' existence no fewer than seven proposals to abolish the office of vice president were advanced.<ref name=\"ames\">{{cite book|last1=Ames|first1=Herman|title=The Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States During the First Century of Its History|date=1896|publisher=[[American Historical Association]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/proposedamendmen00amesrich/page/70 70]\u201372|url=https://archive.org/details/proposedamendmen00amesrich}}</ref> The first such constitutional amendment was presented by [[Samuel W.

Roosevelt raised the stature of the office by renewing the practice of inviting the vice president to cabinet meetings, which every president since has maintained. Roosevelt's first vice president, [[John Nance Garner]], broke with him over the \"[[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing]]\" issue, early in his second term, and became Roosevelt's leading critic. At the start of that term, on [[Second inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|January 20, 1937]], Garner had been the first vice president to be sworn into office on the Capitol steps in the same ceremony with the president; a tradition that continues. Prior to that time, vice presidents were traditionally inaugurated at a separate ceremony in the Senate chamber. [[Gerald R. Ford]] and [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]], who were each appointed to the office under the terms of the 25th amendment, were inaugurated in the House and Senate chambers respectively.\n\n[[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], Roosevelt's vice president during his third term (1941\u20131945), was given major responsibilities during World War II. However, after numerous policy disputes between Wallace and other [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt Administration]] and Democratic Party officials, he was denied renomination to office at the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]]. [[Harry Truman]] was selected instead. During his {{age in days|January 20, 1945|April 12, 1945}} day vice presidency, Truman was not informed about any war or post-war plans, including the [[Manhattan Project]], leading Truman to remark, wryly, that the job of the vice president was to \"go to weddings and funerals\". As a result of this experience, Truman, after succeeding to the presidency upon Roosevelt's death, recognized the need to keep the vice president informed on national security issues. Congress made the vice president one of four statutory members of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] in 1949.\n\nThe stature of the vice presidency grew again while [[Richard Nixon]] was in office (1953\u20131961). He attracted the attention of the media and the Republican party, when [[Dwight Eisenhower]] authorized him to preside at [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meetings in his absence. Nixon was also the first vice president to formally assume temporary control of the executive branch, which he did after Eisenhower suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on September 24, 1955, [[ileitis]] in June 1956, and a [[stroke]] in November 1957.\n\nUntil 1961, vice presidents had their offices on [[Capitol Hill]], a formal office in the Capitol itself and a working office in the [[Russell Senate Office Building]]. [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was the first vice president to be given an office in the White House complex, in the [[Old Executive Office Building]]. The former Navy Secretary's office in the OEOB has since been designated the \"Ceremonial Office of the Vice President\" and is today used for formal events and press interviews. President [[Jimmy Carter]] was the first president to give his vice president, [[Walter Mondale]], an office in the [[West Wing]] of the White House, which all vice presidents have since retained. Because of their function as Presidents of the Senate, vice presidents still maintain offices and staff members on Capitol Hill.\n\nThough Walter Mondale's tenure was the beginning of the modern day power of the vice presidency, the tenure of [[Dick Cheney]] saw a rapid growth in the office of the vice president. Vice President Cheney held a tremendous amount of power and frequently made policy decisions on his own, without the knowledge of the president.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/031013/13cheney.htm|title=Dick Cheney is the most powerful vice president in history.

The vice president may also meet with other heads of state at times when the administration wishes to demonstrate concern or support but cannot send the president personally.\n\n==Selection process==\n===Eligibility===\n\n[[File:Johnadamsvp.flipped.jpg|thumb|[[John Adams]], the first vice president of the United States]]\n\nTo be Constitutionally eligible to serve as the nation's vice president, a person must, according to the Twelfth Amendment, meet the eligibility requirements to become president (which are stated in [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 5: Qualifications for office|Article II, Section 1, Clause 5]]). Thus, to serve as vice president, an individual must:\n* be a [[Natural-born citizen|natural-born]] [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizen]];\n* be at least 35 years old;\n* be a [[Residency (domicile)#United States|resident in the U.S.]] for at least 14 years.<ref name=AC-XII>{{cite web|title=Twelfth Amendment|url=http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/page/twelfth-amendment|work=Annenberg Classroom|publisher=The Annenberg Public Policy Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\nA person who meets the above qualifications is still disqualified from holding the office of vice president under the following conditions:\n* Under [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Clause 7: Judgment in cases of impeachment; Punishment on conviction|Article I, Section 3, Clause 7]], upon conviction in impeachment cases, the Senate has the option of disqualifying convicted individuals from holding federal office, including that of vice president;\n* Under [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Participants in rebellion|Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment]], no person who has sworn an oath to support the Constitution, who has later gone to war against the United States, or given aid and comfort to the nation's enemies can serve in a state or federal office\u2014including as vice president. This disqualification, originally aimed at former supporters of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], may be removed by a two-thirds vote of each house of the Congress.<ref>{{cite web| title=Fourteenth Amendment|url=http://www.annenbergclassroom.org/page/fourteenth-amendment|work=Annenberg Classroom|publisher=The Annenberg Public Policy Center|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |accessdate=February 21, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Nominating process===\n\nThough the vice president does not need to have any political experience, most major-party vice presidential nominees are current or former United States senators or representatives, with the occasional nominee being a current or former governor, a high-ranking military officer, or a holder of a major post within the Executive Department. The vice presidential candidates of the major national political parties are formally selected by each party's quadrennial nominating convention, following the selection of the party's presidential candidate. The official process is identical to the one by which the presidential candidates are chosen, with delegates placing the names of candidates into nomination, followed by a ballot in which candidates must receive a majority to secure the party's nomination.\n\nIn practice, the presidential nominee has considerable influence on the decision, and in the 20th century it became customary for that person to select a preferred running mate, who is then nominated and accepted by the convention. In recent years, with the presidential nomination usually being a foregone conclusion as the result of the primary process, the selection of a vice presidential candidate is often announced prior to the actual balloting for the presidential candidate, and sometimes before the beginning of the convention itself. The first presidential aspirant to announce his selection for vice president before the beginning of the convention was [[Ronald Reagan]] who, prior to the [[1976 Republican National Convention]] announced that [[Richard Schweiker]] would be his running mate. Reagan's supporters then sought to amend the convention rules so that [[Gerald R. Ford]] would be required to name his vice presidential running mate in advance as well. The proposal was defeated, and Reagan did not receive the nomination in 1976. Often, the presidential nominee will name a vice presidential candidate who will bring geographic or ideological balance to the ticket or appeal to a particular constituency.\n\nThe vice presidential candidate might also be chosen on the basis of traits the presidential candidate is perceived to lack, or on the basis of name recognition. To foster party unity, popular runners-up in the presidential nomination process are commonly considered. While this selection process may enhance the chances of success for a national ticket, in the past it often insured that the vice presidential nominee represented regions, constituencies, or ideologies at odds with those of the presidential candidate. As a result, vice presidents were often excluded from the policy-making process of the new administration. Many times their relationships with the president and his staff were aloof, non-existent, or even adversarial.\n\nThe ultimate goal of vice presidential candidate selection is to help and not hurt the party's chances of getting elected; nonetheless, several vice presidential selections have been controversial. In 1984, Democratic nominee [[Walter Mondale]]'s groundbreaking choice of [[Geraldine Ferraro]] as his running mate (the first woman in U.S. history nominated for vice president by a major political party), became a drag on the ticket due to repeated questions about her husband's finances. A selection whose positive traits make the presidential candidate look less favorable in comparison or which can cause the presidential candidate's judgment to be questioned often backfire, such as in 1988 when Democratic candidate [[Michael Dukakis]] chose experienced Texas Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]]; Bentsen was considered a more seasoned statesman in federal politics and somewhat overshadowed Dukakis. Questions about [[Dan Quayle]]'s experience were raised in the 1988 presidential campaign of [[George H. W. Bush]], but the Bush\u2013Quayle ticket still won handily. [[James Stockdale]], the choice of third-party candidate [[Ross Perot]] in 1992, was seen as unqualified by many and Stockdale had little preparation for the vice presidential debate, but the Perot\u2013Stockdale ticket still won about 19% of the vote. In 2008, Republican [[John McCain]] chose [[Sarah Palin]] as his running mate over his primary rivals and/or campaign surrogates such as [[Mitt Romney]] or [[Tom Ridge]]. This surprise move would, it was hoped, draw women voters disappointed by [[Hillary Clinton]]'s defeat in the Democratic presidential primaries into the McCain camp. Palin's selection soon came to be seen as a negative for McCain, due to her several controversies during her gubernatorial tenure which were highlighted by the press, and her feuding with McCain campaign chairman [[Steve Schmidt]]. This perception continued to grow throughout the campaign, especially after [[Sarah Palin interviews with Katie Couric|her interviews with Katie Couric]] led to concerns about her fitness for the presidency.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |authorlink=Adam Nagourney |title=Concerns About Palin's Readiness as Big Test Nears |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 30, 2008 |page=A16 |url=http://www.newyorktimes.com/2008/09/30/us/politics/30palin.htm |accessdate=April 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nHistorically, vice presidential candidates were chosen to provide geographic and ideological balance to a presidential ticket, widening a presidential candidate's appeal to voters from outside their regional base or wing of the party. Candidates from electoral-vote rich states were usually preferred. However, in 1992, moderate Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] (of [[Arkansas]]) chose moderate Democrat [[Al Gore]] (of [[Tennessee]]) as his running mate. Despite the two candidates' near-identical ideological and regional backgrounds, Gore's extensive experience in national affairs enhanced the appeal of a ticket headed by Clinton, whose political career had been spent entirely at the local and state levels of government. In 2000, [[George W. Bush]] chose [[Dick Cheney]] of [[Wyoming]], a reliably Republican state with only three electoral votes, and in 2008, [[Barack Obama]] mirrored Bush's strategy when he chose [[Joe Biden]] of [[Delaware]], a reliably Democratic state, likewise one with only three electoral votes. Both Cheney and Biden were chosen for their experience in national politics (experience lacked by both Bush and Obama) rather than the ideological balance or electoral vote advantage they would provide.\n\nPrior to the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]], both George W. Bush and Dick Cheney lived in and voted in Texas. While nothing in the Constitution prohibits a presidential candidate and his or her running mate being from the same state, the \"inhabitant clause\" of the Twelfth Amendment does mandate that every presidential elector must cast a ballot for at least one candidate who is not from their own state. To avoid creating a potential problem for Texas' electors, Cheney changed his residency back to Wyoming prior to the campaign.<ref name=AC-XII/>\n\nThe first presidential candidate to choose his vice presidential candidate was [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940.<ref name=\"sigelman\">[https://www.jstor.org/pss/2952169 The \"Veepstakes\": Strategic Choice in Presidential Running Mate Selection], by Lee Sigelman and Paul J. Wahlbeck, American Political Science Review, December 1997</ref> The last not to name a vice presidential choice, leaving the matter up to the convention, was [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in 1956. The convention chose [[Tennessee]] Senator [[Estes Kefauver]] over [[Massachusetts]] Senator (and later president) [[John F. Kennedy]]. At the tumultuous 1972 Democratic convention, presidential nominee [[George McGovern]] selected Senator [[Thomas Eagleton]] as his running mate, but numerous other candidates were either nominated from the floor or received votes during the balloting. Eagleton nevertheless received a majority of the votes and the nomination, though he later resigned from the ticket, resulting in [[Sargent Shriver]] becoming McGovern's final running mate; both lost to the Nixon\u2013Agnew ticket by a wide margin, carrying only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.\n\nIn cases where the presidential nomination is still in doubt as the convention approaches, the campaigns for the two positions may become intertwined. In 1976, [[Ronald Reagan]], who was trailing President [[Gerald R. Ford]] in the presidential delegate count, announced prior to the Republican National Convention that, if nominated, he would select Senator [[Richard Schweiker]] as his running mate. This move backfired to a degree, as Schweiker's relatively liberal voting record alienated many of the more conservative delegates who were considering a challenge to party delegate selection rules to improve Reagan's chances. In the end, Ford narrowly won the presidential nomination and Reagan's selection of Schweiker became moot.\n\nIn the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries which pitted [[Hillary Clinton]] against [[Barack Obama]], Clinton suggested a Clinton\u2013Obama ticket with Obama in the vice president slot as it would be \"unstoppable\" against the presumptive Republican nominee. Obama rejected the offer outright saying \"I want everybody to be absolutely clear. I'm not running for vice president. I'm running for president of the United States of America\" while noting \"With all due respect. I won twice as many states as Senator Clinton. I've won more of the popular vote than Senator Clinton. I have more delegates than Senator Clinton. So, I don't know how somebody who's in second place is offering vice presidency to the person who's in first place.\" Obama said the nomination process would have to be a choice between himself and Clinton, saying \"I don't want anybody here thinking that 'Somehow, maybe I can get both,'\" by nominating Clinton and assuming he would be her running mate.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/mar/10/barackobama.hillaryclinton|title=Obama scoffs at Clinton's vice-presidential hint |first1=Allegra|last1=Stratton|first2=Daniel|last2=Nasaw |date=March 11, 2008|newspaper=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/10/dems.campaign/index.html?iref=nextin|title=Obama rejects being Clinton's No.{{nbsp}}2 |publisher=CNN|date=March 11, 2008}}</ref> Some suggested that it was a ploy by the Clinton campaign to denigrate Obama as less qualified for the presidency.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.politico.com/story/2016/06/trump-obama-clinton-2008-ad-224189 |title=Trump throws 2008 Obama ad in Clinton's face |work= Politico |date=June 10, 2016}}</ref> Later, when Obama became the presumptive Democratic nominee, former president [[Jimmy Carter]] cautioned against Clinton being picked for the vice president slot on the ticket, saying \"I think it would be the worst mistake that could be made.

W. Bush. Of these, all but Nixon went directly from one office to the other.\n\nIn recent decades, the vice presidency has frequently been used as a platform to launch bids for the presidency. The transition of the office to its modern stature occurred primarily as a result of Franklin Roosevelt's 1940 nomination, when he captured the ability to nominate his running mate instead of leaving the nomination to the convention. Prior to that, party bosses often used the vice presidential nomination as a consolation prize for the party's minority faction. A further factor potentially contributing to the rise in prestige of the office was the adoption of presidential preference primaries in the early 20th century. By adopting primary voting, the field of candidates for vice president was expanded by both the increased quantity and quality of presidential candidates successful in some primaries, yet who ultimately failed to capture the presidential nomination at the convention.\n\nOf the thirteen presidential elections from 1956 to 2004, nine featured the incumbent president; the other four ([[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988]], [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000]]) all featured the incumbent vice president. Former vice presidents also ran in [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984]] ([[Walter Mondale]]) and in 1968 ([[Richard Nixon]], against the incumbent vice president, [[Hubert Humphrey]]). The presidential election of 2008 was the first since 1928 that saw neither an incumbent president nor an incumbent or former vice president take part in any primary or general election for the presidency on a major party ticket. Nixon is the only vice president to have been elected president while not an incumbent, as well as the only person elected twice to the presidency ''and'' twice to the vice presidency.\n\n==Vacancies==\n\n[[File:Mr. and Mrs. Ford and Nixon 13&nbsp;Oct&nbsp;1973.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=Two women are flanked by two men in suits, standing in a room of the White House.|(Left to right) President [[Richard Nixon]], First Lady [[Pat Nixon]], [[Betty Ford]] and Congressman [[Gerald Ford]] after President Nixon nominated Congressman Ford to be vice president, October 13, 1973]]\n\nPrior to the ratification of the Twenty-fifth Amendment in 1967, no constitutional provision existed for filling an intra-term vacancy in the vice presidency. \n\nAs a result, when one occurred, the office was left vacant until filled through the next ensuing election and inauguration. Between 1812 and 1965, the vice presidency was vacant on sixteen occasions, as a result of seven deaths, one resignation, and eight cases of the vice president succeeding to the presidency. With the vacancy that followed the succession of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1963, the nation had been without a vice president for a cumulative total of 37 years.<ref>{{Cite journal| last=Feerick| first=John D.| title=The Vice-Presidency and the Problems of Presidential Succession and Inability| journal=Fordham Law Review| year=1964| volume=31| issue=3| publisher=Fordham University School of Law| url=https://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol32/iss3/2| pages=457\u2013498| accessdate=October 1, 2019}}</ref><ref name=succesionfacts>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/us/succession-presidential-and-vice-presidential-fast-facts/|title=Succession: Presidential and Vice Presidential Fast Facts|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=September 26, 2016|access-date=January 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nSection 2 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment provides that, \"Whenever there is a vacancy in the office of the Vice President, the President shall nominate a Vice President who shall take office upon confirmation by a majority vote of both Houses of Congress.\"<ref name=XXVHeritage/> This procedure has been implemented twice since the amendment [[Coming into force|came into force]]: the first instance occurred in 1973 following the October 10 resignation of [[Spiro Agnew]], when [[Gerald Ford]] was nominated by President [[Richard Nixon]] and [[United States vice presidential selection, 1973|confirmed by Congress]].

Roosevelt raised the stature of the office by renewing the practice of inviting the vice president to cabinet meetings, which every president since has maintained. Roosevelt's first vice president, [[John Nance Garner]], broke with him over the \"[[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937|court-packing]]\" issue, early in his second term, and became Roosevelt's leading critic. At the start of that term, on [[Second inauguration of Franklin D. Roosevelt|January 20, 1937]], Garner had been the first vice president to be sworn into office on the Capitol steps in the same ceremony with the president; a tradition that continues. Prior to that time, vice presidents were traditionally inaugurated at a separate ceremony in the Senate chamber. [[Gerald R. Ford]] and [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]], who were each appointed to the office under the terms of the 25th amendment, were inaugurated in the House and Senate chambers respectively.\n\n[[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], Roosevelt's vice president during his third term (1941\u20131945), was given major responsibilities during World War II. However, after numerous policy disputes between Wallace and other [[Presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt Administration]] and Democratic Party officials, he was denied renomination to office at the [[1944 Democratic National Convention]]. [[Harry Truman]] was selected instead. During his {{age in days|January 20, 1945|April 12, 1945}} day vice presidency, Truman was not informed about any war or post-war plans, including the [[Manhattan Project]], leading Truman to remark, wryly, that the job of the vice president was to \"go to weddings and funerals\". As a result of this experience, Truman, after succeeding to the presidency upon Roosevelt's death, recognized the need to keep the vice president informed on national security issues. Congress made the vice president one of four statutory members of the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] in 1949.\n\nThe stature of the vice presidency grew again while [[Richard Nixon]] was in office (1953\u20131961). He attracted the attention of the media and the Republican party, when [[Dwight Eisenhower]] authorized him to preside at [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meetings in his absence. Nixon was also the first vice president to formally assume temporary control of the executive branch, which he did after Eisenhower suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on September 24, 1955, [[ileitis]] in June 1956, and a [[stroke]] in November 1957.\n\nUntil 1961, vice presidents had their offices on [[Capitol Hill]], a formal office in the Capitol itself and a working office in the [[Russell Senate Office Building]]. [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] was the first vice president to be given an office in the White House complex, in the [[Old Executive Office Building]]. The former Navy Secretary's office in the OEOB has since been designated the \"Ceremonial Office of the Vice President\" and is today used for formal events and press interviews. President [[Jimmy Carter]] was the first president to give his vice president, [[Walter Mondale]], an office in the [[West Wing]] of the White House, which all vice presidents have since retained. Because of their function as Presidents of the Senate, vice presidents still maintain offices and staff members on Capitol Hill.\n\nThough Walter Mondale's tenure was the beginning of the modern day power of the vice presidency, the tenure of [[Dick Cheney]] saw a rapid growth in the office of the vice president. Vice President Cheney held a tremendous amount of power and frequently made policy decisions on his own, without the knowledge of the president.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/031013/13cheney.htm|title=Dick Cheney is the most powerful vice president in history.

Wreck Cove makes up half of that hydro capacity, making it a key provider of reliable, renewable energy needed to complement and back up the 600 MW of clean \u2013 but unpredictable \u2013 [[wind power]] on the province's electrical system. The Wreck Cove hydroelectric facility is the only one in the province that can go from zero to full output in under 10 minutes.<ref name=\"Tour\">{{cite news |last1=McNeil |first1=Greg |title=Public heads underground to tour Wreck Cove Hydro facility |url=https://www.saltwire.com/news/local/public-heads-underground-to-tour-wreck-cove-hydro-facility-9466/ |accessdate=5 April 2020 |work=Cape Breton Post |publisher=SaltWire Network |date=7 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nWreck Cove primary purpose is to generate electricity, to supply Nova Scotia Powers' [[electrical grid]], but the unique nature of the installation also allows Wreck Cove to play a critical role in NS Power\u2019s ability to meet the reliability standards defined by [[North American Electric Reliability Corporation]] (NERC) and [[Northeast Power Coordinating Council]] (NPCC) and also provides other Grid Reliability Services:\n\n===NERC/NPCC requirements===\n\n====Black Start Requirements====\nUnder NERC, Nove Scotia Power must maintain multiple [[black start]] pathways to re-start the grid should a black-out ever occur. Wreck Cove is one of the two pathways Nova Scotia Power uses to meet this NERC requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Planning Reserve Margin====\nNova Scotia Power must maintain sufficient capacity to serve its firm peak load as well as additional capacity for the planning reserve margin (PRM). The PRM acts as a resource to respond to a contingency to ensure customer load can be served in the event unexpected generation restrictions or supply requirements arise. For example, the PRM capacity ensures adequate generation in the event that one or more generation resources are unavailable or cannot run at full capacity at the time of system peak. Planning reserves also account for uncertainties in demand forecasting and resource availability. The Wreck Cove system contributes approximately 8 percent towards NS Power\u2019s total required capacity in 2020, assuming a PRM of 20 percent.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Operating Reserve Capacity Requirements (10 min reserve)====\nNERC/NPCC requires electric utilities to have their largest single energy production source covered by an alternative source in reserve capacity. Currently, NS Power\u2019s largest single unit is [[Point Aconi Generating Station]] which produces 168 MW of operating capacity. Wreck Cove Units 1 and 2 have an accredited capability of 106 MW each unit (212 MW total), making this facility an important provider of this service. As such, the reliable operation of the Wreck Cove Generating Station provides Nova Scotia Power\u2019s ability to meet this requirement. NPCC also requires that operating reserve capacity be available and on the grid within 10 minutes. If Wreck Cove\u2019s Units 1 and 2 are off-line, they can be brought onto the grid and reach full capacity within the 10-minute requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Tie-Line Regulation====\nWreck Cove assists with providing tie-line regulation. Nova Scotia Power is required to have reserve capacity available for changes in demand across the tie-line to [[New Brunswick]]. Because Wreck Cove is capable of changing its output at the rate of 20 MW/min, it is more effective in responding to fluctuations in Nova Scotia system load and wind generation than slower acting thermal generation sources, which can be moved at a rate of 0.5 MW to 2 MW per minute.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Energy Balancing and Wind Following===\nWreck Cove 1 has been utilized in recent years as a means of balancing energy generation throughout the cycles associated with wind generation. Nova Scotia Power\u2019s hydroelectric generation provides load/wind following services, meaning that the hydroelectric generation is dispatchable and can be used to mitigate the impacts resulting from the high variability of wind generation resources and associated forecasting variations. Although wind following was not the original intent for the use of Wreck Cove, having the ability to utilize Wreck Cove in this way has supported the development and integration of wind generation on the grid. This service is related to the Tie-Line Regulation discussed above, but over a longer time frame. The flexibility of Wreck Cove\u2019s load response is also critical to managing periods of short term, large scale load changes (pickup and drop-off) from industrial customers on the grid.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Grid Reliability Services===\n\n====Load Shaving Capacity====\nWreck Cove provides critical peak load shaving capacity for the short periods of high load that occur daily, typically during morning and evening peak hours. Given Wreck Cove can be brought on-line quickly for these periods of high load ramping, thermal generation resources which cannot be cycled off-and-on frequently can be more economically dispatched.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Scheduling and Dispatch====\nWreck Cove is a source of 212 MW of stored power for Nova Scotia Power to use when needed. It can operate at maximum power for 4-6 hours depending on conditions, at which time it needs to allow water from farther upstream in the watershed to make its way to Surge Lake.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Reactive Supply and Voltage Control====\nNova Scotia Power\u2019s 33 hydro plants/50 hydro units provide 180 MVar of dynamic reactive power to the system. The Nova Scotia Power System Operator controls generators to absorb or produce reactive power to control system voltage. Wreck Cove is located at the eastern end of the transmission grid and therefore its ability to support load is less important than generation closer to the load centre; however, due to its relative size, its dynamic reactive power contributes to stabilizing the grid following disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Primary Frequency Response====\nWreck Cove, like all hydro and thermal generators, is equipped with speed governors which maintain the scheduled grid frequency of 60 Hz. It provides a significant contribution to system inertia, which stabilizes the grid frequency during disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====System Strength====\nHydro generation contributes to system inertia, which allows the system to ride through fault conditions, and short circuit strength, which provides the high fault current levels needed to activate system protection devices (inverter-based wind, tidal and solar do not materially contribute to this).<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nBetween 1975 and 1978, more than 2.5 million cubic metres of rock were blasted and removed to construct the facility\u2019s 11 major [[dam]]s and associated wing dams.  All are [[Dam#Earth-fill_dams|earth dams]] or [[Dam#Rock-fill_dams|rockfill dams]] with an impervious material in the middle (the core dam), with filter material at both sides and rockfill on each dam for stability.<ref name=\"Investigation\">{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Ronald |title=Wreck Cove Hydro-Electric Investigation |journal=Cape Breton's Magazine |date=1 October 1974 |issue=9 |pages=1-12 |url=http://capebretonsmagazine.com/modules/publisher/item.php?itemid=243 |accessdate=5 April 2020 |publisher=Breton Books |location=Wreck Cove, NS |issn=0319-4639 |oclc=1941799}}</ref>\n\nThe development involved the diversion of seven headwater streams, including Indian Brook, West Indian Brook and MacMillan's Brook, Wreck Cove River, MacLeod's Brook, the Ingonish River and the headwaters of [[Ch\u00e9ticamp River]].

The Wreck Cove system contributes approximately 8 percent towards NS Power\u2019s total required capacity in 2020, assuming a PRM of 20 percent.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Operating Reserve Capacity Requirements (10 min reserve)====\nNERC/NPCC requires electric utilities to have their largest single energy production source covered by an alternative source in reserve capacity. Currently, NS Power\u2019s largest single unit is [[Point Aconi Generating Station]] which produces 168 MW of operating capacity. Wreck Cove Units 1 and 2 have an accredited capability of 106 MW each unit (212 MW total), making this facility an important provider of this service. As such, the reliable operation of the Wreck Cove Generating Station provides Nova Scotia Power\u2019s ability to meet this requirement. NPCC also requires that operating reserve capacity be available and on the grid within 10 minutes. If Wreck Cove\u2019s Units 1 and 2 are off-line, they can be brought onto the grid and reach full capacity within the 10-minute requirement.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Tie-Line Regulation====\nWreck Cove assists with providing tie-line regulation. Nova Scotia Power is required to have reserve capacity available for changes in demand across the tie-line to [[New Brunswick]]. Because Wreck Cove is capable of changing its output at the rate of 20 MW/min, it is more effective in responding to fluctuations in Nova Scotia system load and wind generation than slower acting thermal generation sources, which can be moved at a rate of 0.5 MW to 2 MW per minute.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Energy Balancing and Wind Following===\nWreck Cove 1 has been utilized in recent years as a means of balancing energy generation throughout the cycles associated with wind generation. Nova Scotia Power\u2019s hydroelectric generation provides load/wind following services, meaning that the hydroelectric generation is dispatchable and can be used to mitigate the impacts resulting from the high variability of wind generation resources and associated forecasting variations. Although wind following was not the original intent for the use of Wreck Cove, having the ability to utilize Wreck Cove in this way has supported the development and integration of wind generation on the grid. This service is related to the Tie-Line Regulation discussed above, but over a longer time frame. The flexibility of Wreck Cove\u2019s load response is also critical to managing periods of short term, large scale load changes (pickup and drop-off) from industrial customers on the grid.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n===Grid Reliability Services===\n\n====Load Shaving Capacity====\nWreck Cove provides critical peak load shaving capacity for the short periods of high load that occur daily, typically during morning and evening peak hours. Given Wreck Cove can be brought on-line quickly for these periods of high load ramping, thermal generation resources which cannot be cycled off-and-on frequently can be more economically dispatched.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Scheduling and Dispatch====\nWreck Cove is a source of 212 MW of stored power for Nova Scotia Power to use when needed. It can operate at maximum power for 4-6 hours depending on conditions, at which time it needs to allow water from farther upstream in the watershed to make its way to Surge Lake.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Reactive Supply and Voltage Control====\nNova Scotia Power\u2019s 33 hydro plants/50 hydro units provide 180 MVar of dynamic reactive power to the system. The Nova Scotia Power System Operator controls generators to absorb or produce reactive power to control system voltage. Wreck Cove is located at the eastern end of the transmission grid and therefore its ability to support load is less important than generation closer to the load centre; however, due to its relative size, its dynamic reactive power contributes to stabilizing the grid following disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====Primary Frequency Response====\nWreck Cove, like all hydro and thermal generators, is equipped with speed governors which maintain the scheduled grid frequency of 60 Hz. It provides a significant contribution to system inertia, which stabilizes the grid frequency during disturbances.<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n====System Strength====\nHydro generation contributes to system inertia, which allows the system to ride through fault conditions, and short circuit strength, which provides the high fault current levels needed to activate system protection devices (inverter-based wind, tidal and solar do not materially contribute to this).<ref name=\"NSURB\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nBetween 1975 and 1978, more than 2.5 million cubic metres of rock were blasted and removed to construct the facility\u2019s 11 major [[dam]]s and associated wing dams.  All are [[Dam#Earth-fill_dams|earth dams]] or [[Dam#Rock-fill_dams|rockfill dams]] with an impervious material in the middle (the core dam), with filter material at both sides and rockfill on each dam for stability.<ref name=\"Investigation\">{{cite journal |last1=Caplan |first1=Ronald |title=Wreck Cove Hydro-Electric Investigation |journal=Cape Breton's Magazine |date=1 October 1974 |issue=9 |pages=1-12 |url=http://capebretonsmagazine.com/modules/publisher/item.php?itemid=243 |accessdate=5 April 2020 |publisher=Breton Books |location=Wreck Cove, NS |issn=0319-4639 |oclc=1941799}}</ref>\n\nThe development involved the diversion of seven headwater streams, including Indian Brook, West Indian Brook and MacMillan's Brook, Wreck Cove River, MacLeod's Brook, the Ingonish River and the headwaters of [[Ch\u00e9ticamp River]].

{"title_page": "History of the Imperial Japanese Navy (1882-1893)", "text_new": "The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the 1870s, failed in engage in significant expansion. This was due in part to the domestic turmoils such as peasant and samurai uprisings faced by the nascent Meiji government and financial difficulties, as acquiring a large navy was an expensive proposition. Consequently, the IJN concentrated on developing its officer corps and the training of its personnel. However, in the early 1880s, in the aftermath of the [[Imo Incident]] in 1882 and with internal threats to its security eliminated, the Meiji government undertook the first significant naval expansion in Japan's history. The IJN developed plans for the expansion of the fleet to forty-two vessels, thirty-two of which would have to be newly constructed. Between 1882\u20131884, twelve new vessels were purchased or put under construction.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=62}} Spurred on by anxieties over China, Japanese military expenditures grew steadily in the 1880s. In 1880 the share of military spending had amounted to 19 percent of total government expenditures, in 1886 it had risen to 25 percent and by 1890 it stood at 31 percent.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=62}} \n\n==Japanese military buildup==\n===Imo Incident===\nDuring 1882, the [[Imo incident]] occurred in the Korean capital of Seoul. The initial mutiny was triggered by corrupt officials embezzling rice from soldiers pay, it later manifested itself to attacks on Japanese including the death of Horimoto Reizo who had been in the country to train Korean soldiers. The Japanese legation was burned and the minister to Korea, [[Hanabusa Yoshitada]], and twenty seven members of his staff were forced to flee to Japan.{{sfn|Keene|2002|p=373}} There was significant indignation in Japan at the treatment of its nationals.{{sfn|Keene|2002|p=374}} Hanabusa was ordered back to Seoul by the Japanese foreign office to negotiate a settlement with the Koreans, including the punishment of the rioters and compensation for Japanese victims. On August 10, a squadron of eight warships under the command of Admiral [[Nire Kagenori]], was assembled in [[Shimonoseki]] to escort Minister Hanabusa back to Korea.{{sfn|Falk|2006|p=114}} The squadron included the {{ship|Japanese corvette|Amagi||2}}, with a young Lieutenant [[T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d]] as [[executive officer]].{{sfn|Falk|2006|p=114}} This squadron was later assigned to patrols off the Korean coast as a [[show of force]]. The Chinese, however, were able to dispatch a much larger force and quickly gain control of the capital and reasserted Korea's dependency on China.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=54}}\n\nThe Imo crisis had persuaded top civilian leaders in Japan that it was undesirable to postpone expenditure on a larger military.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=62}} During the 1870s, the Japanese government was faced with internal peasant uprisings and samurai rebellions, which had led to rampant inflation and financial difficulties. Consequently, the government had decided in late 1880 to stabilize the currency by increased taxation and financial retrenchment.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=62}} However, the Imo mutiny had underscored the urgency of military expansion, as Japan's limited military and naval power was made apparent. In contrast to the Chinese who had quickly dispatched an expeditionary force to Seoul, where they quickly established order and controlled the situation with their military superiority over the rioters, the Japanese had been forced to pursue a reactive or passive policy.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=62}} To many in the country, including [[Yamagata Aritomo]], the lesson was clear \u2014 that a conscript army of forty thousand men was no longer adequate to Japan's needs and neither was a navy lacking transport ships to dispatch troops abroad: were hostilities to break out with Korea or China, the country would be in a serious predicament. If Japan went to war, it would not have enough vessels to protect the home islands and if it used its fleet to protect the home islands it would not be able to mount an attack overseas. As the Chinese were building up their naval forces, and Japan would be unable to defend itself against China in a possible future conflict. Iwakura argued that it was of the utmost urgency to spend more on the navy even if this meant raising taxes.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=62}} Even Finance Minister [[Matsukata Masayoshi]], who had implemented the fiscal retrenchment policy, agreed that financial resources had to be found for a military and naval buildup if the international situation required. \n\n===Naval expansion bill of 1882===\n[[File:Japanese cruiser Naniwa in 1887.jpg|thumb|300px|The British-built ''{{ship|Japanese cruiser|Naniwa||2}}'' in 1887, was one of the ships ordered as part of the 1882 expansion bill.]]\nAfter the [[Imo Incident]] in July 1882, [[Iwakura Tomomi]] submitted a document to the ''[[Daij\u014d-kan]]'' titled \"Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion\" asserting that a strong navy was essential to maintaining Japanese security.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=26}} In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions were no longer Japan's primary military concern and that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns; a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=26}} Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=26}} and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}} Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}}\n\nAfter lengthy discussions, Iwakura eventually convinced the ruling coalition to support Japan's first multi-year naval expansion plan in history.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}} In May 1883, the government approved a plan that, when completed, would add 32 warships over eight years at a cost of just over \u00a526 million.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}} This development was very significant for the navy, as the amount allocated virtually equaled the navy's entire budget between 1873 and 1882.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}} The 1882 naval expansion plan succeeded in a large part because of [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]] power, influence, and patronage.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=34}} Between 19 August and 23 November 1882, Satsuma forces with Iwakura's leadership, worked tirelessly to secure support for the Navy's expansion plan.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=34}}  After uniting the other Satsuma members of the Dajokan, Iwakura approached the emperor the [[Meiji emperor]] arguing persuasively just as he did with the Daj\u014dkan, that naval expansion was critical to Japan's security and that the standing army of forty thousand men was more than sufficient for domestic purposes.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=34}} While the government should direct the larger share of future military appropriations toward the navy, a powerful navy would legitimize an increase in tax revenue.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=35}} On November 24, the emperor assembled select ministers of the ''daij\u014d-kan'' together with military officers, and announced the need for increased tax revenues to provide adequate funding for military expansion, this was followed by an imperial re-script. The following month, in December, an annual \u00a57.5-million tax increase on sake, soy, and tobacco was fully approved, in the hopes that it would provide \u00a53.5 million annually for warship construction and \u00a52.5 million for warship maintenance.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=35}}  In February 1883, the government directed further revenues from other ministries to support an increase in the navy's warship construction and purchasing budget. By March 1883, the navy secured the \u00a56.5 million required annually to support an eight-year expansion plan, this was the largest that the Imperial Japanese Navy had secured in its young existence.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=35}}\n\nHowever, naval expansion remained a highly contentious issue for both the government and the navy throughout much of the 1880s. Overseas advances in naval technology increased the costs of purchasing large components of a modern fleet, so that by 1885 cost overruns had jeopardized the entire 1883 plan. Furthermore, increased costs coupled with decreased domestic tax revenues, heightened concern and political tension in Japan regarding funding naval expansion.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}}\n\n===Public support===\nThe planned tax-increase of 1882 failed to deliver the estimated revenue for expansion.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}} Consequently, the government sought an alternative means by which to support naval expansion. In 1886, after prolonged discussions, the government  proposed the issuance of public bonds to provide the navy with the necessary funds.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}} With support from the emperor, the government provided a loan to the navy underwritten by [[public bonds]], this was the first bond campaign of the Meiji state that specifically earmarked funds exclusively for military expansion.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}} The total monetary amount of bonds to be issued was \u00a516.7 million, to be divided over three years, with the assumption that roughly \u00a55 million or so would be purchased each year. However, when the first-term bonds were issued, Japanese citizens purchased three times the estimated amount. In 1886 alone, the government secured \u00a516,642,300 from the public. The bonds proved so popular that the emperor asked prime minister Ito Hirobumi to establish a fund to which other citizens could donate money for naval expansion. Serving as an example, on 14 March 1887, the emperor informed the government that the Imperial family would make an initial donation of \u00a5300,000 to help assist naval port development and warship purchases.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}} Commencing on 23 March 1887, the naval collection campaign raised more than \u00a52 million by that September.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}}\n\nRich industrialists and aristocrats also provided large contributions: Prince Shimazu and Prince Mori, the former daimy\u014ds of Satsuma and Ch\u014dshu, respectively, each donated \u00a5100,000; [[Iwasaki Yataro]] of Mitsubishi shipbuilding and his eldest son, Hisaya, each provided \u00a550,000; Kawasaki Hachiroemon of Kawasaki banking and shipbuilding provided \u00a550,000; and Hara Rokur\u014d, president of the [[Yokohama Specie Bank]], donated \u00a550,000.

The initial mutiny was triggered by corrupt officials embezzling rice from soldiers pay, it later manifested itself to attacks on Japanese including the death of Horimoto Reizo who had been in the country to train Korean soldiers. The Japanese legation was burned and the minister to Korea, [[Hanabusa Yoshitada]], and twenty seven members of his staff were forced to flee to Japan.{{sfn|Keene|2002|p=373}} There was significant indignation in Japan at the treatment of its nationals.{{sfn|Keene|2002|p=374}} Hanabusa was ordered back to Seoul by the Japanese foreign office to negotiate a settlement with the Koreans, including the punishment of the rioters and compensation for Japanese victims. On August 10, a squadron of eight warships under the command of Admiral [[Nire Kagenori]], was assembled in [[Shimonoseki]] to escort Minister Hanabusa back to Korea.{{sfn|Falk|2006|p=114}} The squadron included the {{ship|Japanese corvette|Amagi||2}}, with a young Lieutenant [[T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d]] as [[executive officer]].{{sfn|Falk|2006|p=114}} This squadron was later assigned to patrols off the Korean coast as a [[show of force]]. The Chinese, however, were able to dispatch a much larger force and quickly gain control of the capital and reasserted Korea's dependency on China.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=54}}\n\nThe Imo crisis had persuaded top civilian leaders in Japan that it was undesirable to postpone expenditure on a larger military.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=62}} During the 1870s, the Japanese government was faced with internal peasant uprisings and samurai rebellions, which had led to rampant inflation and financial difficulties. Consequently, the government had decided in late 1880 to stabilize the currency by increased taxation and financial retrenchment.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=62}} However, the Imo mutiny had underscored the urgency of military expansion, as Japan's limited military and naval power was made apparent. In contrast to the Chinese who had quickly dispatched an expeditionary force to Seoul, where they quickly established order and controlled the situation with their military superiority over the rioters, the Japanese had been forced to pursue a reactive or passive policy.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=62}} To many in the country, including [[Yamagata Aritomo]], the lesson was clear \u2014 that a conscript army of forty thousand men was no longer adequate to Japan's needs and neither was a navy lacking transport ships to dispatch troops abroad: were hostilities to break out with Korea or China, the country would be in a serious predicament. If Japan went to war, it would not have enough vessels to protect the home islands and if it used its fleet to protect the home islands it would not be able to mount an attack overseas. As the Chinese were building up their naval forces, and Japan would be unable to defend itself against China in a possible future conflict. Iwakura argued that it was of the utmost urgency to spend more on the navy even if this meant raising taxes.{{sfn|Duus|1998|p=62}} Even Finance Minister [[Matsukata Masayoshi]], who had implemented the fiscal retrenchment policy, agreed that financial resources had to be found for a military and naval buildup if the international situation required. \n\n===Naval expansion bill of 1882===\n[[File:Japanese cruiser Naniwa in 1887.jpg|thumb|300px|The British-built ''{{ship|Japanese cruiser|Naniwa||2}}'' in 1887, was one of the ships ordered as part of the 1882 expansion bill.]]\nAfter the [[Imo Incident]] in July 1882, [[Iwakura Tomomi]] submitted a document to the ''[[Daij\u014d-kan]]'' titled \"Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion\" asserting that a strong navy was essential to maintaining Japanese security.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=26}} In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions were no longer Japan's primary military concern and that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns; a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=26}} Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=26}} and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}} Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}}\n\nAfter lengthy discussions, Iwakura eventually convinced the ruling coalition to support Japan's first multi-year naval expansion plan in history.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}} In May 1883, the government approved a plan that, when completed, would add 32 warships over eight years at a cost of just over \u00a526 million.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}} This development was very significant for the navy, as the amount allocated virtually equaled the navy's entire budget between 1873 and 1882.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}} The 1882 naval expansion plan succeeded in a large part because of [[Satsuma han|Satsuma]] power, influence, and patronage.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=34}} Between 19 August and 23 November 1882, Satsuma forces with Iwakura's leadership, worked tirelessly to secure support for the Navy's expansion plan.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=34}}  After uniting the other Satsuma members of the Dajokan, Iwakura approached the emperor the [[Meiji emperor]] arguing persuasively just as he did with the Daj\u014dkan, that naval expansion was critical to Japan's security and that the standing army of forty thousand men was more than sufficient for domestic purposes.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=34}} While the government should direct the larger share of future military appropriations toward the navy, a powerful navy would legitimize an increase in tax revenue.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=35}} On November 24, the emperor assembled select ministers of the ''daij\u014d-kan'' together with military officers, and announced the need for increased tax revenues to provide adequate funding for military expansion, this was followed by an imperial re-script. The following month, in December, an annual \u00a57.5-million tax increase on sake, soy, and tobacco was fully approved, in the hopes that it would provide \u00a53.5 million annually for warship construction and \u00a52.5 million for warship maintenance.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=35}}  In February 1883, the government directed further revenues from other ministries to support an increase in the navy's warship construction and purchasing budget. By March 1883, the navy secured the \u00a56.5 million required annually to support an eight-year expansion plan, this was the largest that the Imperial Japanese Navy had secured in its young existence.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=35}}\n\nHowever, naval expansion remained a highly contentious issue for both the government and the navy throughout much of the 1880s. Overseas advances in naval technology increased the costs of purchasing large components of a modern fleet, so that by 1885 cost overruns had jeopardized the entire 1883 plan. Furthermore, increased costs coupled with decreased domestic tax revenues, heightened concern and political tension in Japan regarding funding naval expansion.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=27}}\n\n===Public support===\nThe planned tax-increase of 1882 failed to deliver the estimated revenue for expansion.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}} Consequently, the government sought an alternative means by which to support naval expansion. In 1886, after prolonged discussions, the government  proposed the issuance of public bonds to provide the navy with the necessary funds.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}} With support from the emperor, the government provided a loan to the navy underwritten by [[public bonds]], this was the first bond campaign of the Meiji state that specifically earmarked funds exclusively for military expansion.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}} The total monetary amount of bonds to be issued was \u00a516.7 million, to be divided over three years, with the assumption that roughly \u00a55 million or so would be purchased each year. However, when the first-term bonds were issued, Japanese citizens purchased three times the estimated amount. In 1886 alone, the government secured \u00a516,642,300 from the public. The bonds proved so popular that the emperor asked prime minister Ito Hirobumi to establish a fund to which other citizens could donate money for naval expansion. Serving as an example, on 14 March 1887, the emperor informed the government that the Imperial family would make an initial donation of \u00a5300,000 to help assist naval port development and warship purchases.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}} Commencing on 23 March 1887, the naval collection campaign raised more than \u00a52 million by that September.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}}\n\nRich industrialists and aristocrats also provided large contributions: Prince Shimazu and Prince Mori, the former daimy\u014ds of Satsuma and Ch\u014dshu, respectively, each donated \u00a5100,000; [[Iwasaki Yataro]] of Mitsubishi shipbuilding and his eldest son, Hisaya, each provided \u00a550,000; Kawasaki Hachiroemon of Kawasaki banking and shipbuilding provided \u00a550,000; and Hara Rokur\u014d, president of the [[Yokohama Specie Bank]], donated \u00a550,000. These donations provided funds to cover purchases as well as the cost overruns associated with the construction of Kure and Sasebo naval stations.{{sfn|Schencking|2005|p=37}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|last=Duus|first=Peter|title=The Abacus and the Sword: The Japanese Penetration of Korea|publisher=University of California Press|year=1998|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-52092-090-2|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Evans|first=David C|last2=Peattie|first2=Mark R|authorlink2=Mark Peattie|title=Kaigun: strategy, tactics, and technology in the Imperial Japanese Navy, 1887\u20131941|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|year=1997|isbn=0-87021-192-7|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Falk|first=Edwin A.|title=Togo and the Rise of Japanese Sea Power|year=2006|location=|publisher=Scholar's Bookshelf|edition=illustrated, reprint - 1936|isbn=1-601-05046-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Keene|first=Donald|authorlink=Donald Keene|title=Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852\u20131912|url=https://archive.org/details/emperorofjapanme00keen|url-access=registration|year=2002|location=New York|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=0-231-12341-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Peattie|first=Mark R|year=1992|title=Nan'y\u014d: The Rise and Fall of the Japanese in Micronesia, 1885\u20131945|series=Pacific Islands Monograph|volume=4|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=0-8248-1480-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Schencking|first=J.

This was a record for the most victories in a single season since the franchise moved to California. It was also only the second winning season in Sterling's tenure as owner.  In the lockout-shortened 2011\u20132012 season they made the playoffs with the best winning percentage in their history (.606) and they won their first round series against the Memphis Grizzlies, 4\u20133, before being swept by the San Antonio Spurs, 4\u20130, in the conference semi-finals.  Led by [[Blake Griffin]] and [[Chris Paul]], the Clippers posted two more winning campaigns in [[2012\u201313 Los Angeles Clippers season|2012\u201313]] and [[2013\u201314 Los Angeles Clippers season|2013\u201314]], setting new franchise records for regular-season wins with 56 and 57, respectively.\n\nSterling rebuffed numerous offers from other cities to relocate the Clippers and was steadfast in his refusal to move the team out of Los Angeles, let alone sell the team.  While the team played a few games in [[Anaheim]] in the [[Arrowhead Pond]] (now the Honda Center) for a few years before the Staples Center opened, he was not willing to move the team there permanently.  In later years, he showed an increased willingness to spend. In 2003, Sterling signed [[Elton Brand]] to a six-year, $82 million deal, the biggest contract in franchise history. He matched the contract the [[Utah Jazz]] offered [[Nba free agency#Types of free agency|restricted free agent]] [[Corey Maggette]]: a deal worth $45 million over six years. The Clippers signed higher-priced veteran free agents, such as [[Cuttino Mobley]] in 2005, [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] in 2006, and Los Angeles native [[Baron Davis]] in 2008. In another first during the Sterling tenure of Clippers ownership, the team gave a four-year contract extension to head coach [[Mike Dunleavy, Sr.]], as well as a five-year extension to center [[Chris Kaman]]. Both extensions took effect starting in the [[2007\u201308 NBA season]].\n\nUnder Sterling's ownership, only Dunleavy and [[Bill Fitch]] (1994\u20131998) lasted four seasons or more as Clippers head coach; as of the [[2009\u201310 NBA season]], Dunleavy entered his seventh season as Clippers head coach, by far the longest tenure in franchise history, but was relieved of his coaching duties on February 4, 2010.

The lawsuit featured several racist statements allegedly made by Sterling to employees, such as that \"black people smell and attract vermin\" and \"hispanics just smoke and hang around the building\" as well as Sterling's alleged intent to rent only to Korean tenants because \"they will pay the rent and live in whatever conditions I give them\". Part of the HRC case's resolution included U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer awarding the plaintiffs' attorney $4.9 million in attorneys fees. While the final terms for the plaintiffs were confidential, the judge said the fees were justified as the settlement obtained by the plaintiffs against Sterling was one of the largest of its kind and the public benefit terms were significant and wide-ranging.{{Citation needed|reason=no source provided lawsuit or verdict|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Sterling for housing discrimination for using race as a factor in filling some of his apartment buildings. The suit charged that Sterling refused to rent to non-Koreans in the Koreatown neighborhood and to African Americans in Beverly Hills. In November 2009, ESPN reported that Sterling agreed to pay a fine of $2.7 million to settle the lawsuit.<ref name=\"2006lawsuit\">{{cite news | title=Sterling settles housing bias lawsuit | date=November 3, 2009 | agency=Associated Press | work=ESPN | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=4619819}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2009, the Clippers were sued in L.A.

This was a record for the most victories in a single season since the franchise moved to California. It was also only the second winning season in Sterling's tenure as owner.  In the lockout-shortened 2011\u20132012 season they made the playoffs with the best winning percentage in their history (.606) and they won their first round series against the Memphis Grizzlies, 4\u20133, before being swept by the San Antonio Spurs, 4\u20130, in the conference semi-finals.  Led by [[Blake Griffin]] and [[Chris Paul]], the Clippers posted two more winning campaigns in [[2012\u201313 Los Angeles Clippers season|2012\u201313]] and [[2013\u201314 Los Angeles Clippers season|2013\u201314]], setting new franchise records for regular-season wins with 56 and 57, respectively.\n\nSterling rebuffed numerous offers from other cities to relocate the Clippers and was steadfast in his refusal to move the team out of Los Angeles, let alone sell the team.  While the team played a few games in [[Anaheim]] in the [[Arrowhead Pond]] (now the Honda Center) for a few years before the Staples Center opened, he was not willing to move the team there permanently.  In later years, he showed an increased willingness to spend. In 2003, Sterling signed [[Elton Brand]] to a six-year, $82 million deal, the biggest contract in franchise history. He matched the contract the [[Utah Jazz]] offered [[Nba free agency#Types of free agency|restricted free agent]] [[Corey Maggette]]: a deal worth $45 million over six years. The Clippers signed higher-priced veteran free agents, such as [[Cuttino Mobley]] in 2005, [[Tim Thomas (basketball)|Tim Thomas]] in 2006, and Los Angeles native [[Baron Davis]] in 2008. In another first during the Sterling tenure of Clippers ownership, the team gave a four-year contract extension to head coach [[Mike Dunleavy, Sr.]], as well as a five-year extension to center [[Chris Kaman]]. Both extensions took effect starting in the [[2007\u201308 NBA season]].\n\nUnder Sterling's ownership, only Dunleavy and [[Bill Fitch]] (1994\u20131998) lasted four seasons or more as Clippers head coach; as of the [[2009\u201310 NBA season]], Dunleavy entered his seventh season as Clippers head coach, by far the longest tenure in franchise history, but was relieved of his coaching duties on February 4, 2010.

Part of the HRC case's resolution included U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer awarding the plaintiffs' attorney $4.9 million in attorneys fees.
