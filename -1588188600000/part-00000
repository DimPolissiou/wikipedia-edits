The [[Vasquez Rocks]], {{convert|40|mi}} north of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], were one of his many hideouts and are named after him.\n\n== Early life ==\nTiburcio Vasquez was born in [[Monterey]], [[Alta California]], Mexico (present-day [[California]], United States) on April 11, 1835 to Jos\u00e9 Hermenegildo Vasquez and Mar\u00eda Guadalupe Cantua.<ref name=\"Acu\u00f1a\">{{harvnb|Acu\u00f1a|2011|p=140}}</ref><ref name=\"Boessenecker_013\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|p=13}}</ref> In accord with Spanish tradition, Vasquez's birth was celebrated on the feast day of his namesake, St. Tiburtius. Thus, he always referred to his birthday as August 11, 1835.<ref name=\"Boessenecker\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010}}</ref> His great-grandfather came to Alta California with the [[De Anza Expedition]] of 1776. Vasquez was slightly built,  about {{convert|5|ft|7|in|cm}}. His family sent him to school, and he was fluent in both English and Spanish.\n\nIn 1852, Vasquez was influenced by [[Anastacio Garc\u00eda]], one of California's most dangerous bandits.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_046\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=46\u201348}}</ref> In 1854, Vasquez was present at the slaying of Monterey Constable William Hardmount in a fight with Anastacio Garc\u00eda at a [[fandango (dance)|fandango]]. Vasquez denied any involvement and fled, becoming an outlaw. Vasquez later claimed his crimes were the result of discrimination by the ''norteamericanos'' and insisted that he was a defender of Mexican-American rights.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_049\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=49\u201353}}</ref> Vasquez and Garc\u00eda played leading roles in Monterey County's murderous Roach-Belcher feud, which ended when Garc\u00eda was executed by hanging in 1875.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_054-069\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=54\u201369}}</ref>\n\nBy 1856, Vasquez was rustling horses. A sheriff's posse caught up with him near [[Santa Clarita, California|Newhall]], and he spent the next five years behind bars in [[San Quentin]] prison. There he helped organize, and participated in, four bloody prison breaks which left twenty convicts dead.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_070\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=70\u2013101}}</ref> After his release, he committed numerous burglaries, cattle thefts, and highway robberies in Sonoma County in 1866. He was captured after a store burglary in [[Petaluma]] and sent to prison again for three years.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_102\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=102\u2013120}}</ref> His \"trademark\" was \"binding [his victims'] hands behind their back and leaving them face down in the dust.\"<ref name=\"Roddy\">{{harvnb|Roddy|1970}}</ref>\n\n== Final years ==\nIn 1870, Vasquez organized a bandit gang, which included the notorious Juan Soto, and later, [[Procopio|Procopio Bustamante]]. After numerous bandit raids, he was shot and badly wounded in a gunfight with [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]] police officer Robert Liddell. He managed to escape, and his sisters nursed him back to health.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_165\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=165\u2013172}}</ref>\n\nIn 1873, he gained statewide, and then nationwide, notoriety. Vasquez and his gang stole $2,200 from Snyder's Store in [[Tres Pinos]], now called [[Paicines, California|Paicines]], in [[San Benito County]]. Three were killed, but not by Tiburcio. [[Posse Comitatus (Common Law)|Posses]] began searching for him, and Governor [[Newton Booth]] placed a $1,000 reward on his head. Sheriff John H. Adams from San Jose pursued the band to Southern California; Vasquez escaped after a gunfight.<ref>{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=213\u2013241}}</ref>\n\nVasquez hid for a while in Southern California, where he was less well known. With his two most trusted men, he rode over the [[Tejon Pass (Kern County)|old Tejon Pass]], through the [[Antelope Valley]], and rested at Jim Hefner's ranch at [[Elizabeth Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Elizabeth Lake]]. Vasquez's brother, Francisco, lived nearby. After resting, Vasquez rode on to [[Littlerock, California|Littlerock]] Creek, which became his first [[Southern California]] hideout.\n\nVasquez was popular in the Mexican-American community, and had many friends and family members from Santa Rosa in Northern California to Los Angeles in the south.

The groundskeeper directed Vasquez relative, Patrick McAnaney, to the grave in 1980, telling him \"Vasquez lived at odds with the people, and he was buried at odds with them.\" This was in reference to his gravestone being set at an angle relative to the other gravestones. \n\nAs of Aug 12, 2017, historian and Psychic Medium, Michael J. Kouri and friends found his grave after a long search. Online photos show his grave beside two large cacti and in front of a palm tree, no longer standing. However, they fail to mention that his carved granite headstone is the only stone in the entire cemetery to stand at an angle. All the rest are in uniform rows, and many other graves surrounding Vasquez's grave are flat to the ground as if no one else wanted to be interred near the famous bandido until decades later when his fame had died down. Vasquez's ghost is said to haunt many places, including the cemetery, some of his hideouts, areas where gruesome crimes were committed, and the prison cells where he was held.\n\nWith his upper-class [[Californio]] background, Vasquez is thought to have been one of several sources for the bandit-hero character [[Zorro]].<ref>{{harvnb|Deutch|2008|}}</ref>\n\nThe actor [[Anthony Caruso (actor)|Anthony Caruso]] played Vasquez in ''[[Stories of the Century]].''\n\nArmand Alzamora (1928\u20132009) played Vasquez in the 1957 episode, \"The Last Bad Man\" of the syndicated anthology series, ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]].

Vasquez was slightly built,  about {{convert|5|ft|7|in|cm}}. His family sent him to school, and he was fluent in both English and Spanish.\n\nIn 1852, Vasquez was influenced by [[Anastacio Garc\u00eda]], one of California's most dangerous bandits.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_046\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=46\u201348}}</ref> In 1854, Vasquez was present at the slaying of Monterey Constable William Hardmount in a fight with Anastacio Garc\u00eda at a [[fandango (dance)|fandango]]. Vasquez denied any involvement and fled, becoming an outlaw. Vasquez later claimed his crimes were the result of discrimination by the ''norteamericanos'' and insisted that he was a defender of Mexican-American rights.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_049\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=49\u201353}}</ref> Vasquez and Garc\u00eda played leading roles in Monterey County's murderous Roach-Belcher feud, which ended when Garc\u00eda was executed by hanging in 1875.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_054-069\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=54\u201369}}</ref>\n\nBy 1856, Vasquez was rustling horses. A sheriff's posse caught up with him near [[Santa Clarita, California|Newhall]], and he spent the next five years behind bars in [[San Quentin]] prison. There he helped organize, and participated in, four bloody prison breaks which left twenty convicts dead.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_070\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=70\u2013101}}</ref> After his release, he committed numerous burglaries, cattle thefts, and highway robberies in Sonoma County in 1866.

He managed to escape, and his sisters nursed him back to health.<ref name=\"Boessenecker_165\">{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=165\u2013172}}</ref>\n\nIn 1873, he gained statewide, and then nationwide, notoriety.

[[Posse Comitatus (Common Law)|Posses]] began searching for him, and Governor [[Newton Booth]] placed a $1,000 reward on his head. Sheriff John H. Adams from San Jose pursued the band to Southern California; Vasquez escaped after a gunfight.<ref>{{harvnb|Boessenecker|2010|pp=213\u2013241}}</ref>\n\nVasquez hid for a while in Southern California, where he was less well known. With his two most trusted men, he rode over the [[Tejon Pass (Kern County)|old Tejon Pass]], through the [[Antelope Valley]], and rested at Jim Hefner's ranch at [[Elizabeth Lake (Los Angeles County, California)|Elizabeth Lake]]. Vasquez's brother, Francisco, lived nearby. After resting, Vasquez rode on to [[Littlerock, California|Littlerock]] Creek, which became his first [[Southern California]] hideout.\n\nVasquez was popular in the Mexican-American community, and had many friends and family members from Santa Rosa in Northern California to Los Angeles in the south. He was handsome, literate, charming, played guitar, and was a skillful dancer. Women were attracted to him and he had many love affairs.

The groundskeeper directed Vasquez relative, Patrick McAnaney, to the grave in 1980, telling him \"Vasquez lived at odds with the people, and he was buried at odds with them.\" This was in reference to his gravestone being set at an angle relative to the other gravestones. \n\nAs of Aug 12, 2017, historian and Psychic Medium, Michael J. Kouri and friends found his grave after a long search. Online photos show his grave beside two large cacti and in front of a palm tree, no longer standing. However, they fail to mention that his carved granite headstone is the only stone in the entire cemetery to stand at an angle. All the rest are in uniform rows, and many other graves surrounding Vasquez's grave are flat to the ground as if no one else wanted to be interred near the famous bandido until decades later when his fame had died down. Vasquez's ghost is said to haunt many places, including the cemetery, some of his hideouts, areas where gruesome crimes were committed, and the prison cells where he was held.\n\nWith his upper-class [[Californio]] background, Vasquez is thought to have been one of several sources for the bandit-hero character [[Zorro]].<ref>{{harvnb|Deutch|2008|}}</ref>\n\nThe actor [[Anthony Caruso (actor)|Anthony Caruso]] played Vasquez in ''[[Stories of the Century]].''\n\nArmand Alzamora (1928\u20132009) played Vasquez in the 1957 episode, \"The Last Bad Man\" of the syndicated anthology series, ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', hosted by [[Stanley Andrews]]. The segment focuses on Vasquez's early life of crime, his hatred for the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|US takeover of California]], the prison escape, and his hanging at the age of 39.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0556823/|title=The Last Bad Man on ''Death Valley Days''|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=September 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe trunk and knife that belonged to Tiburcio are on display at the [[Andres Pico Adobe]] in [[Mission Hills, Los Angeles|Mission Hills]], part of the [[San Fernando Valley Historical Society]] collection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://californiahistoricalsociety.blogspot.com/2016/08/history-keepers-knife-and-trunk-of.html|title=History Keepers: Knife and Trunk of Tiburcio Vasquez|last=|first=|date=2016-08-03|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Places named for Vasquez ===\n==== Geographical features ====\n* [[Vasquez Rocks]], an area of distinctive rock formations in the [[Sierra Pelona Mountains]] that is popular as a filming location for movies and television\n* Vasquez Canyon in [[Saugus, California]]\n* Vasquez Tree, outside of the 21-mile house, in [[Morgan Hill, California]]\n* Vasquez day use area in the [[Angeles National Forest]]\n* Tiburcio's X and (Vasquez's) Monolith, two rock faces popular with climbers in [[Pinnacles National Park, California|Pinnacles National Park]], were named for the legend that Vasquez hid out in a cave below the Monolith.<ref>{{harvnb|Rubine|1995|pp=12,55,62}}</ref>\n\n==== Buildings and facilities ====\n* Tiburcio Vasquez Health Center, [[Hayward, California]] and [[Union City, California|Union City]]<ref>{{harvnb|Our History: What's in a name?|2013}}</ref>\n* Vasquez High School in [[Acton, California#Education|Acton, California]]\n* The Alisal Union School District near [[Salinas, California]] named a new school Tiburcio Vasquez Elementary School in 2012.
