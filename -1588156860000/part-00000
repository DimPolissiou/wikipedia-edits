Even when the line to Mughalsarai was being constructed and only the lines near Howrah were put in operation, the first train ran from Allahabad to Kanpur in 1859 and the Kanpur-Etawah section was opened to traffic in the 1860s. For the first through train from Howrah to Delhi in 1864, coaches were ferried on boats across the [[Yamuna]] at Allahabad. With the completion of the [[Old Naini Bridge]] across the Yamuna  through trains started running in 1865-66.<ref name=irfcai>{{cite web| url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-hist.html  |title = IR History: Early History (1832-1869) | publisher= IRFCA| accessdate = 23 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,396,403,500 |title=Allahabad Division: A Historical Perspective |publisher=North Central Railway |accessdate=24 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601154617/http://www.ncr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0%2C1%2C396%2C403%2C500 |archive-date= 1 June 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-12/patna/31330356_1_indian-railways-danapur-division-railway-board |title = Railways enter 159th year of its journey| publisher= The Times of India, 23 June 2013| accessdate = 24 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe {{RailGauge|1000mm}} wide [[metre gauge]] Delhi-Bandikui and Bandikui-Agra lines of Rajputana State Railway were opened in 1874.<ref name=irfcaii>{{cite web| url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history2.html|title = IR History:Early Days II (1870-1899)| publisher= IRFCA| accessdate =23 June 2013 }}</ref> The lines were converted to broad gauge in early 2000s.\n\nThe Hathras Road-Mathura Cantt broad gauge line was opened in 1875 and the Agra-Gwalior broad gauge line was opened in 1881.<ref name=irfcaii/>\n\nThe broad gauge Agra-Delhi chord was opened in 1904.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-history3.html|title = IR History: Part III (1900-1947)| publisher= IRFCA| accessdate =23 June 2013 }}</ref> Some parts of it were relaid during the construction of New Delhi (inaugurated in 1927-28).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/TopStories/A-fine-balance-of-luxury-and-care/Article1-723880.aspx | title = A fine balance of luxury and care | publisher = Hindusthan Times, 21 July 2011 | accessdate = 2 July 2013 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130602112944/http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/TopStories/A-fine-balance-of-luxury-and-care/Article1-723880.aspx | archive-date = 2 June 2013 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe  {{convert|61.80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long  {{RailGauge|1676mm}} wide [[Indian gauge|broad gauge]] Barhan-Etah line was constructed in 1959.<ref name=transport>{{cite web| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v21-4YYgocUC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=Muri-Chandrapura+line&source=bl&ots=2lfbxydpeo&sig=k1wlrhY-A8FVApK4K4u1NYGqLGY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=nx9yUca-D4iErQeVn4G4CA&ved=0CDgQ6AEwAjge#v=onepage&q=Muri-Chandrapura%20line&f=false |title = Transport Geography of India: Commodity Flow and the Regional Structure of Indian Economy| work= page 60|last= Moonis Raza & Yash Aggarwal|publisher= Concept Publishing Company, A-15/16 Commercial Block, Mohan Garden, New Delhi - 110059| ISBN = 81-7022-089-0|accessdate = 26 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe  {{convert|54.3|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long {{RailGauge|1676mm}} wide [[Indian gauge|broad gauge]] Ghaziabad-Tughlakabad line, including bridge across [[Yamuna]], was completed in 1966.<ref name=transport/>\n\n==Electrification==\nThe Kanpur-Panki sector was electrified in 1968-69, Panki-Tundla in 1971-72, Tundla-Aligarh-Ghaziabad in 1975-76, Ghaziabad-Nizamuddin-New Delhi-Delhi in 1976-77, Tilak Bridge-Fairdabad in 1982-83, Raja ki Mandi-Agra-Dhoulpur in 1984-85, Tundla-Yamuna Bridge in 1998-99 and Yamuna Bridge-Agra in 1990-91.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://irfca.org/docs/electrification-history.html|title = History of Electrification| publisher= IRFCA| accessdate = 24 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Loco sheds==\nKanpur Central electric loco shed accommodates [[Indian locomotive class WAP-4|WAP-4]] and [[Indian locomotive class WAG-7|WAG-7]] electric locos.

They had another demo EP planned for release in 2005 (no such EP materialized, although recordings surfaced online). For this the first versions of \"Return To Energiser\" and \"Labyrinth\" were recorded. Early versions of \"OK Time for Plan B\" and \"We Can Breathe in Space\" were also recorded around this time but it's unclear if these were destined for the EP. It was at this time that Kerrang! Radio's Alex Baker picked up on the band, and as he didn't have a physical release to play, he streamed \"OK Time For Plan B\" off the band's Myspace page, straight onto the airwaves.\n\nIn August 2006 they released a video of the single \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\" which became the single of the week on the [[iTunes Store]]. Their 1st physical single featured re-recorded versions of \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which had previously been featured on one of the demo EPs. It was released on 30 October 2006. It was limited to 1000 copies of each format and sold out within the first week of release. In mid January 2007, Enter Shikari's first single, \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\", entered the UK singles chart for one week at number 151, on Downloads only (despite its physical formats not being eligible for charts [at the band's request]). This was followed a week later by \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which charted at number 182 on the singles chart (despite its physical formats being ineligible for charts [at the band's request]) and number 146 in the Download Chart. In addition \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\" featured on the [[EA Sports]] video game titles [[NHL 08]] and [[Madden 08]]. Enter Shikari secured a spot on the Gibson/Myspace stage at 2006's [[Download Festival#Download 2006|Download Festival]].\n\nThey also had interviews with popular music press such as ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and ''[[Rock Sound]]''.

This was the band's second single to be released from their forthcoming debut album. It contained a re-recorded version of the song \"Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour\". It reached 27 in the Official UK chart.\n\nThe band released a compilation album titled ''[[The Zone (Enter Shikari)|The Zone]]'' just before the debut album, this contained various demo tracks and previously released singles.\n\n=== ''Take to the Skies'' (2007\u201308) ===\n{{main|Take to the Skies}}\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]'', was released on 19 March 2007 and on 25 March it reached number 4 in the UK Official Album Charts.

So much happened over those two years [since the release of their previous album], globally and in my personal life, so before. I was kind of comfortable. I have a very finely attuned cringe muscle, I don\u2019t like writing about things that have been written about a thousand times.

In 2003, guitarist Rory Clewlow joined the band to complete its current lineup, and it adopted its current name. In 2006, they performed to a growing fanbase at [[Download Festival]] as well as a sold-out concert at the [[London Astoria]]. Their debut studio album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]'', was released in 2007 and reached number 4 in the [[UK Albums Chart|Official UK Album Chart]], and has since been certified gold in the UK. Their second, ''[[Common Dreads]]'', was released in 2009 and debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 16;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/albums.shtml |title=Radio 1 \u2013 The Official Chart with Reggie Yates \u2013 The Official UK Top 40 Albums Chart |publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 March 2011}}</ref> while their third, ''[[A Flash Flood of Colour]]'', was released in 2012 and debuted on the chart at number 4. Both have since been certified silver in the UK. The band spent a considerable amount of time supporting the latter release through the [[A Flash Flood of Colour World Tour]], before beginning work on a fourth studio album, ''[[The Mindsweep]]'', which was released in 2015. Their fifth studio album ''[[The Spark (album)|The Spark]]'' was released in 2017. Their sixth album ''[[Nothing Is True & Everything Is Possible]]'' was released in April 2020.\n\nEnter Shikari have their own record label, Ambush Reality. However, they have also signed distribution deals with several major labels to help with worldwide distribution. Their eclectic musical style combines influences from rock music genres with those from various [[electronic music]] genres.\n\n==History==\n\n=== Beginnings (1999\u20132006) ===\n\nIn 1999 a band named Hybryd formed, consisting of Rou Reynolds on guitar and vocals, Chris Batten on bass guitar, and Rob Rolfe on drums. They released an EP called ''[[Commit No Nuisance]]'', which featured the tracks \"Perfect Pygmalion\", \"Look Inside\", \"Torch Song\", \"Honesty Box\" and \"Fake\". In 2003, with the addition of guitarist Rory Clewlow, Hybryd became Enter Shikari. The band was named after ''Shikari'', a boat belonging to vocalist Rou Reynolds' uncle. \"Shikari is a [[Hindi]] word for hunter.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Access All Areas.net.au |url=http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Enter_Shikari.php |title=Enter Shikari &#124; Artist Interviews |publisher=Access All Areas |accessdate=12 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304025238/http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Enter_Shikari.php |archivedate=4 March 2011 }}</ref> After the band's lineup and name change, Reynolds focused his musical efforts on vocals and electronics instead of guitar.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enter Shikari: Unplugged & Personal|url=https://headlinermagazine.net/headliners/enter-shikari-unplugged-and-personal.html|website=Headliner Magazine|accessdate=13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring 2003 and 2004, the band released three demo EPs (''[[Nodding Acquaintance]]'', ''[[Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour EP|Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour]]'' and ''[[Sorry You're Not a Winner EP|Sorry You're Not a Winner]]'') that were available from their gigs and their website, featuring original versions of some songs that were eventually rerecorded for their debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]''. They had another demo EP planned for release in 2005 (no such EP materialized, although recordings surfaced online). For this the first versions of \"Return To Energiser\" and \"Labyrinth\" were recorded. Early versions of \"OK Time for Plan B\" and \"We Can Breathe in Space\" were also recorded around this time but it's unclear if these were destined for the EP. It was at this time that Kerrang! Radio's Alex Baker picked up on the band, and as he didn't have a physical release to play, he streamed \"OK Time For Plan B\" off the band's Myspace page, straight onto the airwaves.\n\nIn August 2006 they released a video of the single \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\" which became the single of the week on the [[iTunes Store]]. Their 1st physical single featured re-recorded versions of \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which had previously been featured on one of the demo EPs. It was released on 30 October 2006. It was limited to 1000 copies of each format and sold out within the first week of release. In mid January 2007, Enter Shikari's first single, \"[[Mothership (song)|Mothership]]\", entered the UK singles chart for one week at number 151, on Downloads only (despite its physical formats not being eligible for charts [at the band's request]). This was followed a week later by \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\", which charted at number 182 on the singles chart (despite its physical formats being ineligible for charts [at the band's request]) and number 146 in the Download Chart. In addition \"[[Sorry You're Not a Winner/OK Time for Plan B]]\" featured on the [[EA Sports]] video game titles [[NHL 08]] and [[Madden 08]]. Enter Shikari secured a spot on the Gibson/Myspace stage at 2006's [[Download Festival#Download 2006|Download Festival]].\n\nThey also had interviews with popular music press such as ''[[Kerrang!]]'' and ''[[Rock Sound]]''. On 4 November 2006, they became only the second unsigned band to ever sell out [[London Astoria]] (the first being [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]]).\n\nThey also made the ''[[NME]]'''s \"New Noise 2007\", a list of the bands it considers most likely to achieve success in the coming year (previous years lists have included the likes of [[Arcade Fire]], [[Hot Chip]] and [[Bloc Party]]).\n\nThe next single released was \"[[Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour]]\", on 5 March 2007. This was the band's second single to be released from their forthcoming debut album. It contained a re-recorded version of the song \"Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour\". It reached 27 in the Official UK chart.\n\nThe band released a compilation album titled ''[[The Zone (Enter Shikari)|The Zone]]'' just before the debut album, this contained various demo tracks and previously released singles.\n\n=== ''Take to the Skies'' (2007\u201308) ===\n{{main|Take to the Skies}}\n\nThe band's debut album, ''[[Take to the Skies]]'', was released on 19 March 2007 and on 25 March it reached number 4 in the UK Official Album Charts. It contained re-recordings of many of the songs that had featured on the demo EPs and singles that were released prior to the release of the album.\n\nDuring the month of March 2007 it was announced they would be playing at [[Download Festival]], [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]], [[Give it a Name]], [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[Oxegen]] festival in Ireland and [[Rock am Ring]] in Germany.

This was followed by three more North American tours.\n\nOn 13 May 2008, the band released the first in a series of videos called \"Enter Shikari: In the 'Low\". The videos, posted on the band's YouTube page, showcased the band as they recorded their new single, \"[[We Can Breathe In Space, They Just Don't Want Us To Escape]]\", and demoed new material. One of the new songs set to feature on the album was 'Step Up', which was first performed at [[Milton Keynes]] Pitz on 28 June 2008, the warm up show to [[Projekt Revolution]] the following day.\n\n===''Common Dreads'' (2009\u20132011)===\n{{main|Common Dreads}}\n[[File:Enter Shikari Live @ Heaven.jpg|thumb|left|Enter Shikari live at [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]] in London in 2009.

So much happened over those two years [since the release of their previous album], globally and in my personal life, so before. I was kind of comfortable. I have a very finely attuned cringe muscle, I don\u2019t like writing about things that have been written about a thousand times.

He was the elder son of [[Alfred the Great]] and his wife [[Ealhswith]]. When Edward succeeded to the throne, he had to defeat a challenge from his cousin [[\u00c6thelwold \u00e6theling|\u00c6thelwold]], who had a strong claim to the throne as the son of Alfred's elder brother and predecessor, [[\u00c6thelred I, King of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].\n\nAlfred had succeeded \u00c6thelred as king of [[Wessex]] in 871, and almost faced defeat against the Danish [[Viking]]s until his decisive victory at the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878. After the battle, the Vikings still ruled [[Northumbria]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and eastern [[Mercia]], leaving only Wessex and western Mercia under Anglo-Saxon control. In the early 880s [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]], the ruler of western Mercia, accepted Alfred's lordship and married his daughter [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]], and around 886 Alfred adopted the new title King of the Anglo-Saxons as the ruler of all Anglo-Saxons not subject to Danish rule.\n\nIn 910 a Mercian and West Saxon army inflicted a decisive defeat on an invading Northumbrian army, ending the threat from the northern Vikings. In the 910s, Edward conquered Viking-ruled southern England in partnership with his sister \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, who had succeeded as Lady of the Mercians following the death of her husband in 911. Historians dispute how far Mercia was dominated by Wessex during this period, and after \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death in June 918, her daughter [[\u00c6lfwynn]], briefly became second Lady of the Mercians, but in December Edward took her into Wessex and imposed direct rule on Mercia. By the end of the 910s he ruled Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia, and only Northumbria remained under Viking rule. In 924 he faced a Mercian and Welsh revolt at [[Chester]], and after putting it down he died at [[Farndon, Cheshire|Farndon]] in [[Cheshire]] on 17 July 924. He was succeeded by his eldest son [[\u00c6thelstan]].\n\nEdward was admired by medieval chroniclers, and in the view of [[William of Malmesbury]], he was \"much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters\" but \"incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule\". He was largely ignored by modern historians until the 1990s, and [[Nick Higham (historian)|Nick Higham]] described him as \"perhaps the most neglected of English kings\", partly because few primary sources for his reign survive. His reputation rose in the late twentieth century and he is now seen as destroying the power of the Vikings in southern England while laying the foundations for a south-centred Germany nazi hitler\n\n==Background==\n[[Mercia]] was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by [[Wessex]] at the [[Battle of Ellandun]] in 825. Thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, which was to be an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings.{{sfn|Keynes and Lapidge|1983|pp=11\u201312}} In 865 the Danish Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] landed in [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and used this as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians were forced to pay off the Vikings, who invaded [[Northumbria]] the following year. They appointed a puppet king in 867, and then moved on Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867\u2013868. King [[Burgred]] of Mercia was joined by King [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex]] and his brother, the future [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]], for a combined attack on the Vikings, who refused an engagement; in the end the Mercians bought peace with them. The following year, the Danes conquered East Anglia, and in 874 they expelled King Burgred and, with their support, [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceolwulf]] became the last King of Mercia. In 877 the Vikings partitioned Mercia, taking the eastern regions for themselves and allowing Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. In early 878 they invaded Wessex, and many West Saxons submitted to them. Alfred, who was now king, was reduced to a remote base in the [[Isle of Athelney]] in [[Somerset]], but the situation was transformed when he won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Edington]]. He was thus able to prevent the Vikings from taking Wessex and western Mercia, although they still occupied Northumbria, East Anglia and eastern Mercia.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|pp=245\u201357}}\n\n==Childhood==\n[[File:Will of Alfred the Great (New Minster Liber Vitae) - BL Stowe MS 944, f 30v.jpg|thumb|A page from the will of Alfred the Great, which left the bulk of his estate to Edward]]\nEdward's parents, Alfred and [[Ealhswith]], married in 868. Her father was [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]], and her mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family. Alfred and Ealhswith had five children who survived childhood. The oldest was [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]], who married [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]], and ruled as Lady of the Mercians after his death. Edward was next, and the second daughter, [[\u00c6thelgifu, abbess of Shaftesbury|\u00c6thelgifu]], became [[Shaftesbury Abbey|abbess of Shaftesbury]]. The third daughter, [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]], married [[Baldwin II, Margrave of Flanders|Baldwin, Count of Flanders]], and the younger son, [[\u00c6thelweard (son of Alfred)|\u00c6thelweard]], was given a scholarly education, including learning Latin. This would usually suggest that he was intended for the church, but it is unlikely in \u00c6thelweard's case as he later had sons. There were also an unknown number of children who died young. Neither part of Edward's name, which means 'protector of wealth', had been used previously by the West Saxon royal house, and [[Barbara Yorke]] suggests that he may have been named after his maternal grandmother Eadburh, reflecting the West Saxon policy of strengthening links with Mercia.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=25\u201328}}\n\nHistorians estimate that Edward was probably born in the mid-870s. His eldest sister, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, was probably born about a year after her parents' marriage, and Edward was brought up with his youngest sister, \u00c6lfthryth; Yorke argues that he was therefore probably nearer in age to \u00c6lfthryth than \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. Edward led troops in battle in 893, and must have been of marriageable age in that year as his oldest son \u00c6thelstan was born about 894.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1pp=25\u201326|2a1=Miller|2y=2004}} According to [[Asser]] in his ''Life of King Alfred'', Edward and \u00c6lfthryth were educated at court by male and female tutors, and read ecclesiastical and secular works in English, such as the [[Psalms]] and [[Old English poetry|Old English poems]]. They were taught the courtly qualities of gentleness and humility, and Asser wrote that they were obedient to their father and friendly to visitors. This is the only known case of an Anglo-Saxon prince and princess receiving the same upbringing.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n==\u00c6theling==\n[[File:Britain 886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of Britain in 886]]\nAs a son of a king, Edward was an [[\u00e6theling]], a prince of the royal house who was eligible for kingship. Even though he had the advantage of being the eldest son of the reigning king, his accession was not assured as he had cousins who had a strong claim to the throne. [[\u00c6thelhelm]] and [[\u00c6thelwold of Wessex|\u00c6thelwold]] were sons of \u00c6thelred, Alfred's older brother and predecessor as king, but they had been passed over because they were infants when their father died. Asser gives more information about Edward's childhood and youth than is known about other Anglo-Saxon princes, providing details about the training of a prince in a period of [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] influence, and Yorke suggest that we may know so much due to Alfred's efforts to portray his son as the most throneworthy \u00e6theling.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=25, 29\u201330}}\n\n\u00c6thelhelm is only recorded in Alfred's will of the mid-880s, and probably died at some time in the next decade, but \u00c6thelwold is listed above Edward in the only [[charter]] where he appears, probably indicating a higher status. \u00c6thelwold may also have had an advantage because his mother Wulfthryth witnessed a charter as queen, whereas Edward's mother Ealhswith never had a higher status than king's wife.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00c6thelhelm|1y= PASE |2a1=S 356|2y=Sawyer|3a1=Yorke|3y=2001|3p=31}} However, Alfred was in a position to give his own son considerable advantages. In his will, he left only a handful of estates to his brother's sons, and the bulk of his property to Edward, including all his [[Bookland (law)|booklands]] (land vested in a charter which could be alienated by the holder, as opposed to folkland, which had to pass to [[heirs of the body]]) in [[Kent]].{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes and Lapidge|1y=1983|1pp=175\u201376, 321\u201322|2a1=Yorke|2y=2001|2p=30}} Alfred also advanced men who could be depended on to support his plans for his succession, such as his brother-in-law, a Mercian ealdorman called \u00c6thelwulf, and his son-in-law \u00c6thelred. Edward witnessed several of his father's charters, and often accompanied him on royal peregrinations.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=31\u201335}} In a Kentish charter of 898 Edward witnessed as ''rex Saxonum'', suggesting that Alfred may have followed the strategy adopted by his grandfather [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]] of strengthening his son's claim to succeed to the West Saxon throne by making him sub-king of Kent.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=32}}\n\nOnce Edward grew up, Alfred was able to give him military commands and experience in royal administration.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=31\u201332}} The English defeated renewed Viking attacks in 893 to 896, and in [[Richard Abels]]' view, the glory belonged to \u00c6thelred and Edward rather than Alfred himself. In 893 Edward defeated the Vikings in the Battle of Farnham, although he was unable to follow up his victory as his troops' period of service had expired and he had to release them. The situation was saved by the arrival of troops from London led by \u00c6thelred.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=294\u2013304}} Yorke argues that although Alfred packed the [[witan]] with members whose interests lay in the continuation of Alfred's line, that may not have been sufficient to ensure Edward's accession if he had not displayed his fitness for kingship.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=37}}\n\nIn about 893, Edward probably married [[Ecgwynn]], who bore him two children, the future King \u00c6thelstan and a daughter who married [[Sitric C\u00e1ech]], a Viking King of York. The twelfth-century chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] described Ecgwynn as an ''illustris femina'' (noble lady), and stated that Edward chose \u00c6thelstan as his heir as king. She may have been related to St [[Dunstan]], the aristocratic tenth-century [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. But William of Malmesbury also stated that \u00c6thelstan's accession in 924 was opposed by a nobleman who claimed that his mother was a concubine of low birth.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1pp=33\u201334|2a1=Bailey|2y=2001|2p=114|3a1=Mynors, Thomson and Winterbottom|3y=1998|3p=199}} The suggestion that Ecgwynn was Edward's mistress is accepted by some historians such as [[Simon Keynes]] and Richard Abels,{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes|1y=1999|1p=467|2a1=Abels|2y=1998|2p=307}} but Yorke and \u00c6thelstan's biographer, [[Sarah Foot]], disagree, arguing that the allegations should be seen in the context of the disputed succession in 924, and were not an issue in the 890s.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1p=33|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2p=31}} Ecgwynn probably died by 899, as around the time of Alfred's death Edward married [[\u00c6lffl\u00e6d, wife of Edward the Elder|\u00c6lffl\u00e6d]], the daughter of Ealdorman \u00c6thelhelm, probably of [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=33}}\n\n[[Janet Nelson]] suggests that there was conflict between Alfred and Edward in the 890s. She points out that the contemporary ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', produced under court auspices in the 890s, does not mention Edward's military successes. These are known only from the late tenth century chronicle of [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], such as his account of the Battle of Farnham, in which in Nelson's view \"Edward's military prowess, and popularity with a following of young warriors, are highlighted\". Towards the end of his life Alfred invested his young grandson \u00c6thelstan in a ceremony which historians see as designation as eventual successor to the kingship. Nelson argues that while this may have been proposed by Edward to support the accession of his own son, on the other hand it may have been intended by Alfred as part of a scheme to divide the kingdom between his son and grandson. \u00c6thelstan was sent to be brought up in Mercia by \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d and \u00c6thelred, but it is not known whether this was Alfred's idea or Edward's. Alfred's wife Ealhswith was ignored in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' in her husband's lifetime, but emerged from obscurity when her son acceded. This may be because she supported her son against her husband.{{sfn|Nelson|1996| pp= 53\u201354, 63\u201366}}\n\n==\u00c6thelwold's revolt==\n{{further|\u00c6thelwold's Revolt}}\n[[File:Coin of King Edward the Elder.JPG|thumb|240px|Coin of Edward the Elder]]\nAlfred died on 26 October 899 and Edward succeeded to the throne, but \u00c6thelwold disputed the succession.{{sfn|Miller|2004}} He seized the royal estates of [[Wimborne]], symbolically important as the place where his father was buried, and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], both in [[Dorset]].

Edward retaliated by ravaging East Anglia, but when he retreated the men of Kent disobeyed the order to retire, and were intercepted by the Danish army. The two sides met at the [[Battle of the Holme]] (perhaps [[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme]] in [[Huntingdonshire]]) on 13 December 902. According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', the Danes \"kept the place of slaughter\", meaning that they won the battle, but they suffered heavy losses, including \u00c6thelwold and a King Eohric, possibly of the East Anglian Danes. Kentish losses included Sigehelm, ealdorman of Kent and father of Edward's third wife, Eadgifu. \u00c6thelwold's death ended the threat to Edward's throne.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1pp=321\u2013322|2a1=Hart|2y=1992|2pp=512\u201315|3a1=Miller|3y=2004}}\n\n==King of the Anglo-Saxons==\nIn London in 886 Alfred had received the formal submission of \"all the English people that were not under subjection to the Danes\", and thereafter he adopted the title ''Anglorum Saxonum rex'' (King of the Anglo-Saxons), which is used in his later charters and all but two of Edward's. This is seen by Keynes as \"the invention of a wholly new and distinctive polity\", covering both West Saxons and Mercians, which was inherited by Edward with the support of Mercians at the West Saxon court, of whom the most important was [[Plegmund]], Archbishop of Canterbury. In 903 Edward issued several charters concerning land in Mercia. Three of them are witnessed by the Mercian leaders and their daughter [[\u00c6lfwynn]], and they all contain a statement that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d \"then held rulership and power over the race of the Mercians, under the aforesaid king\". Other charters were issued by the Mercian leaders which did not contain any acknowledgment of Edward's authority, but they did not issue their own coinage.{{sfn|Keynes|2001|pp=44\u201358}} This view of Edward's status is accepted by Martin Ryan, who states that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d had \"a considerable but ultimately subordinate share of royal authority\" in English Mercia.{{sfn|Ryan|2013|p=298}}\n\nOther historians disagree. [[Pauline Stafford]] describes \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as \"the last Mercian queen\",{{sfn|Stafford|2001|p=45}} while in Charles Insley's view Mercia kept its independence until \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death in 918.{{sfn|Insley|2009|p=330}} Michael Davidson contrasts the 903 charters with one of 901 in which the Mercian rulers were \"by grace of God, holding, governing and defending the monarchy of the Mercians\". Davidson comments that \"the evidence for Mercian subordination is decidedly mixed. Ultimately, the ideology of the 'Kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons' may have been less successful in achieving the absorption of Mercia and more something which I would see as a murky political coup.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' was compiled at the West Saxon court from the 890s, and the entries for the late ninth and early tenth centuries are seen by historians as reflecting the West Saxon viewpoint; Davidson observes that \"Alfred and Edward possessed skilled 'spin doctors'\".{{sfnm|1a1=Davidson|1y=2001|1pp=203\u201305|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2p=43}} Some versions of the ''Chronicle'' incorporate part of a lost ''Mercian Register'', which gives a Mercian perspective and details of \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's campaign against the Vikings.{{sfn |Ryan|2013|p=298}}\n\nIn the late ninth and early tenth centuries, connection by marriage with the West Saxon royal house was seen as prestigious by continental rulers. In the mid-890s Alfred had married his daughter \u00c6lfthryth to Baldwin II of Flanders, and in 919 Edward married his daughter [[Eadgifu of Wessex|Eadgifu]] to [[Charles the Simple]], King of [[West Francia]]. In 925, after Edward's death, another daughter [[Eadgyth]] married [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], the future [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]] and (after Eadgyth's death) [[Holy Roman Emperor]].{{sfn|Sharp|2001|pp=81\u201386}}\n\n==Conquest of the southern Danelaw==\nNo battles are recorded between the Anglo-Saxons and the Danish Vikings for several years after the [[Battle of the Holme]], but in 906 Edward agreed peace with the East Anglian and Northumbrian Danes, suggesting that there had been conflict. According to one version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' he made peace \"of necessity\", which implies that he was forced to buy them off.{{sfn|Miller|2004}} He encouraged Englishmen to purchase land in Danish territory, and two charters survive relating to estates in [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Derbyshire]].{{sfn|Abrams|2001|p=136}} In 909 Edward sent a combined West Saxon and Mercian army which harassed the Northumbrian Danes, and seized the bones of the Northumbrian royal saint [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]] from [[Bardney Abbey]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. Oswald was [[Translation (relic)|translated]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|a new Mercian minster]] established by \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d in [[Gloucester]] and the Danes were compelled to accept peace on Edward's terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=323|2a1=Heighway|2y=2001|2p=108}} In the following year, the Northumbrian Danes retaliated by raiding Mercia, but on their way home they were met by a combined Mercian and West Saxon army at the [[Battle of Tettenhall]], where the Vikings suffered a disastrous defeat. After that, the Northumbrian Danes never ventured south of the River [[Humber]], and Edward and his Mercian allies were able to concentrate on conquering the southern Danelaw in East Anglia and the [[Five Boroughs]] of Viking east Mercia: [[Derby]], [[Leicester]], [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]].{{sfn|Miller|2004}} \n\nIn 911 \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians, died, and Edward took control of the Mercian lands around London and [[Oxford]]. \u00c6thelred was succeeded as ruler by his widow \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as Lady of the Mercians, and she had probably been acting as ruler for several years as \u00c6thelred seems to have been incapacitated in later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=324, n. 1|2a1=Wainwright|2y=1975|2pp=308\u201309|3a1=Bailey|3y=2001|3p=113}}\n\nEdward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d then began the construction of fortresses to guard against Viking attacks and protect territory captured from them. In November 911, he constructed a fort on the north bank of the [[River Lea]] at [[Hertford]] to guard against attack by the Danes of [[Bedford]] and [[Cambridge]]. In 912, he marched with his army to [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex, and ordered the building of a fort at [[Witham]] and a second fort at Hertford, which protected London from attack and encouraged many English living under Danish rule in Essex to submit to him. In 913 there was a pause in his activities, although \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d continued her fortress building in Mercia.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=324\u201325}} \n\nIn 914, a Viking army sailed from [[Brittany]] and ravaged the [[Severn]] estuary. It then attacked [[Ergyng]] in south-east Wales (now [[Archenfield]] in [[Herefordshire]]) and captured the Bishop, referred to as Cameleac, Cimeliauc and Cyfeilliog, depending on the source. Edward ransomed him for the large sum of forty pounds of silver. The Vikings were defeated in 915 by the armies of Hereford and Gloucester, and gave hostages and oaths to keep the peace. According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', one of the two jarls who had led the raids, Hroald, was killed, as was the brother of the other jarl.<ref>Worcester Manuscript, p. 99, quoted in {{cite web |url=https://htt.herefordshire.gov.uk/herefordshires-past/the-anglo-saxon-period/the-vikings/the-vikings-in-herefordshire/ |title=The Vikings in Herefordshire |date=2005|last=Greene|first=Miranda |publisher=Herefordshire Council |access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nEdward maintained an army on the south side of the estuary in case the Vikings broke their promises, and he twice had to repel attacks. In the autumn the Vikings moved on to Ireland. The episode suggests that south-east Wales fell within the West Saxon sphere of power, unlike [[Brycheiniog]] just to the north, where Mercia was dominant.{{sfnm|1a1=Charles-Edwards|1y=2013|1p=506|2a1=Miller|2y=2004}} In late 914 Edward built two forts at [[Buckingham]], and Earl Thurketil, the leader of the Danish army at Bedford submitted to him. The following year he occupied Bedford, and constructed another fortification on the south bank of the [[River Great Ouse]] against a Viking one on the north bank. In 916 Edward returned to Essex and built a fort at Maldon to bolster the defence of Witham. He also helped Earl Thurketil and his followers to leave England, reducing the number of Viking armies in the Midlands.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|pp=325\u201326}}\n\nThe decisive year in the war was 917. In April Edward built a fort at [[Towcester]] as a defence against the Danes of [[Northampton]], and another at an unidentified place called Wigingamere. The Danes launched unsuccessful attacks on Towcester, Bedford and Wigingamere, while \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d captured Derby, showing the value of the English defensive measures, which were aided by disunity and a lack of coordination among the Viking armies. The Danes had built their own fortress at [[Tempsford]] in Bedfordshire, but at the end of the summer the English stormed it and killed the last Danish king of East Anglia. The English then took [[Colchester]], although they did not try to hold it. The Danes retaliated by sending a large army to lay siege to Maldon, but the garrison held out until it was relieved and the retreating army was heavily defeated. Edward then returned to Towcester and reinforced its fort with a stone wall, and the Danes of nearby Northampton submitted to him. The armies of Cambridge and East Anglia also submitted, and by the end of the year the only Danish armies still holding out were those of four of the Five Boroughs, Leicester, Stamford, Nottingham, and Lincoln.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=327\u201329}}\n\nIn early 918, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d secured the submission of Leicester without a fight, and the Danes of Northumbrian York offered her their allegiance, probably for protection against [[Norwegians#Viking Age|Norse]] (Norwegian) Vikings who had invaded Northumbria from Ireland, but she died on 12 June before she could take up the proposal. The same offer is not known to have been made to Edward, and the Norse Vikings took York in 919. According to the main West Saxon version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', after \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death the Mercians submitted to Edward, but the Mercian version (the ''Mercian Register'') states that in December 918 her daughter \u00c6lfwynn \"was deprived of all authority in Mercia and taken into Wessex\". Mercia may have made a bid for continued semi-independence which was suppressed by Edward, and it then came under his direct rule. Stamford had surrendered to Edward before \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death, and Nottingham did the same shortly afterwards. According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for 918, \"all the people who had settled in Mercia, both Danish and English, submitted to him\". This would mean that he ruled all England south of the Humber, but it is not clear whether Lincoln was an exception, as coins of Viking York in the early 920s were probably minted at Lincoln.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=329\u201331}} Some Danish [[earl|jarls]] were allowed to keep their estates, although Edward probably also rewarded his supporters with land, and some he kept in his own hands. Coin evidence suggests that his authority was stronger in the East Midlands than in East Anglia.{{sfnm|1a1=Abrams|1y=2001|1pp=138\u201339|2a1=Lyon|2y=2001|2p=74}} Three Welsh kings, [[Hywel Dda]], Clydog and [[Idwal Foel]], who had previously been subject to \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, now gave their allegiance to Edward.{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|2013|pp=484, 498\u2013500}}\n[[File:Early-Medieval coin , Penny of Edward the Elder (FindID 223825).jpg|thumb|Penny of Edward the Elder|alt=Penny of Edward the Elder]]\n\n==Coinage==\nThe principal currency in later Anglo-Saxon England was the [[Penny (English coin)|silver penny]], and some coins carried a stylised portrait of the king. Edward's coins had \"EADVVEARD REX\" on the [[obverse]] and the name of the moneyer on the reverse. The places of issue were not shown in his reign, but they were in that of his son \u00c6thelstan, allowing the location of many moneyers of Edward's reign to be established. There were mints in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Canterbury]], Chester, [[Chichester]], Derby, [[Exeter]], [[Hereford]], London, Oxford, [[Shaftesbury]], [[Shrewsbury]], [[Southampton]], [[Stafford]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]], Winchester and probably other towns. No coins were struck in the name of \u00c6thelred or \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, but from around 910 mints in English Mercia produced coins with an unusual decorative design on the reverse. This ceased before 920, and probably represents \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's way of distinguishing her coinage from that of her brother. There was also a minor issue of coins in the name of Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury. There was a dramatic increase in the number of moneyers over Edward's reign, fewer than 25 in the south in the first ten years rising to 67 in the last ten years, around five in English Mercia rising to 23, plus 27 in the conquered Danelaw.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyon|1y=2001|1pp=67\u201373, 77|2a1=Blackburn|2y=2014}}\n\n==Church==\nIn 908, Plegmund conveyed the alms of the English king and people to the Pope, the first visit to Rome by an Archbishop of Canterbury for almost a century, and the journey may have been to seek papal approval for a proposed re-organisation of the West Saxon sees.{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=210, 213}} When Edward came to the throne Wessex had two dioceses, [[Diocese of Winchester|Winchester]], held by [[Denewulf]], and [[Diocese of Sherborne|Sherborne]], held by Asser.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|pp=230\u201331}} In 908 Denewulf died and was replaced the following year by [[Frithestan]]; soon afterwards Winchester was divided into two sees, with the creation of the [[diocese of Ramsbury]] covering Wiltshire and [[Berkshire]], while Winchester was left with [[Hampshire]] and [[Surrey]]. Forged charters date the division to 909, but this may not be correct. Asser died in the same year, and at some date between 909 and 918 Sherborne was divided into three sees, [[Diocese of Crediton|Crediton]] covering [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and [[diocese of Wells|Wells]] covering Somerset, leaving Sherborne with Dorset.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2004b|2a1=Brooks|2y=1984|2pp=212\u201313}} The effect of the changes was to strengthen the status of Canterbury compared with Winchester and Sherborne, but the division may have been related to a change in the secular functions of West Saxon bishops, to become agents of royal government in shires rather than provinces, assisting in defence and taking part in shire courts.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|p=243}}\n\nAt the beginning of Edward's reign, his mother Ealhswith founded the abbey of St Mary for nuns, known as the [[Nunnaminster]], in Winchester.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|p=231}} Edward's daughter [[Eadburh of Winchester|Eadburh]] became a nun there, and she was venerated as a saint and the subject of a hagiography by [[Osbert of Clare]] in the twelfth century.{{sfn|Thacker|2001|pp=259\u201360}} In 901, Edward started building a major religious community for men, possibly in accordance with his father's wishes. The monastery was next to Winchester Cathedral, which became known as the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] while Edward's foundation was called the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]]. It was much larger than the Old Minster, and was probably intended as a royal mausoleum.{{sfnm|1a1=Rumble|1y=2001|1pp=231\u201334|2a1=Marafioti|2y=2014|2pp=26\u201329}} It acquired relics of the Breton [[Saint Judoc]], which probably arrived in England from [[Ponthieu]] in 901, and the body of one of Alfred's closest advisers, [[Grimbald]], who died in the same year and who was soon venerated as a saint. Edward's mother died in 902, and he buried her and Alfred there, moving his father's body from the Old Minster. Burials in the early 920s included Edward himself, his brother \u00c6thelweard, and his son [[\u00c6lfweard of Wessex|\u00c6lfweard]]. On the other hand, when \u00c6thelstan became king in 924, he did not show any favour to his father's foundation, probably because Winchester sided against him when the throne was disputed after Edward's death. The only other king buried at the New Minster was [[Eadwig]], in 959.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2001|1pp=xxv\u2013xxix|2a1=Thacker|2y=2001|2pp=253\u201354}}\n\nEdward's decision not to expand the Old Minster, but rather to overshadow it with a much larger building, suggests animosity towards Bishop Denewulf, and this was compounded by forcing the Old Minster to cede both land for the new site, and an estate of 70 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] at [[Beddington]] to provide an income for the New Minster. Edward was remembered by the New Minster as a benefactor, but at the Old Minster as ''rex avidus'' (greedy king).{{sfnm|1a1=Rumble|1y=2001|1pp=234\u201337, 244|2a1=Thacker|2y=2001|2p=254}} He may have built the new church because he did not think that the Old Minster was grand enough to be the royal mausoleum for kings of the Anglo-Saxons, not just the West Saxons like their predecessors.{{sfn|Marafioti|2014|pp=28\u201331}} Alan Thacker comments:\n:Edward's method of endowing New Minster was of a piece with his ecclesiastical policy in general. Like his father he gave little to the church \u2014 indeed, judging by the dearth of charters for much of his reign he seems to have given away little at all{{nbsp}}... More than any other, Edward's kingship seems to epitomise the new hard-nosed monarchy of Wessex, determined to exploit all its resources, lay and ecclesiastical, for its own benefit.{{sfn|Thacker|2001|p=254}} \n[[Patrick Wormald]] observes: \"The thought occurs that neither Alfred nor Edward was greatly beloved at Winchester Cathedral; and one reason for Edward's moving his father's body into the new family shrine next door was that he was surer of sincere prayers there.\"{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=274\u201375}}\n\n==Learning and culture==\nThe standard of Anglo-Saxon learning declined severely in the ninth century, particularly in Wessex, and Mercian scholars such as Plegmund played a major part in the revival of learning initiated by Alfred. Mercians were prominent at the courts of Alfred and Edward, and the Mercian dialect and scholarship commanded West Saxon respect.{{sfn|Gretsch|2001|p=287}} It is uncertain how far Alfred's programmes continued during his son's reign. English translations of works in Latin made during Alfred's reign continued to be copied, but few original works are known. The script known as Anglo-Saxon Square [[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]] reached maturity in the 930s, and its earliest phases date to Edward's reign. The main scholarly and scriptorial centres were the cathedral centres of Canterbury, Winchester and Worcester; monasteries did not make a significant contribution until \u00c6thelstan's reign.{{sfn|Lapidge|1993|pp=12\u201316}} Very little survives of the manuscript production of Edward's reign.{{sfn|Higham|2001a|p=2}}\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxon art#Textile art|only surviving large scale embroideries]] which were certainly made in Anglo-Saxon England date to Edward's reign. They are a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], a maniple and a possible [[girdle]] removed from the coffin of [[St Cuthbert]] in [[Durham Cathedral]] in the nineteenth century. They were donated to the shrine by \u00c6thelstan in 934, but inscriptions on the embroideries show that they were commissioned by Edward's second wife, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d, as a gift to Frithestan, [[Bishop of Winchester]]. They probably did not reach their intended destination because \u00c6thelstan was on bad terms with Winchester.{{sfnm|1a1=Coatsworth|1y=2001|1pp=292\u201396|2a1=Wilson|2y=1984|2p=154}}\n\n==Law and administration==\nAlmost all surviving charters from Edward's reign are later copies, and the only surviving original is not a charter of Edward himself, but a grant by \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d in 901.{{sfn|Lapidge|1993|p=13}} In the same year a meeting at Southampton was attended by his brother and sons, his household [[thegn]]s and nearly all bishops, but no ealdormen. It was on this occasion that the king acquired land from the Bishop of Winchester for the foundation of the New Minster, Winchester. No charters survive for the period from 910 to the king's death in 924, much to the puzzlement and distress of historians. Charters were usually issued when the king made grants of land, and it is possible that Edward followed a policy of retaining property which came into his hands to help finance his campaigns against the Vikings.{{sfn|Keynes|2001|pp=50\u201351, 55\u201356}} Charters rarely survive unless they concerned property which passed to the church and were preserved in their archives, and another possibility is that Edward was making grants of property only on terms which ensured that they returned to male members of the royal house; such charters would not be found in church archives.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=275}}\n\nClause 3 of the law code called ''I Edward'' provides that people convincingly charged with perjury shall not be allowed to clear themselves by oath, but only by [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal]].

Smyth]] points out that Edward was not in a position to impose the same conditions on the Scots and the Northumbrians as he could on conquered Vikings, and argues that the ''Chronicle'' presented a treaty between kings as a submission to Wessex.{{sfn|Smyth|1984|p=199}} Stafford observes that the rulers had met at [[Bakewell]] on the border between Mercia and Northumbria, and that meetings on borders were generally considered to avoid any implication of submission by either side.{{sfn|Stafford|1989|p=33}} Davidson points out that the wording \"chosen as father and lord\" applied to conquered army groups and burhs, not relations with other kings. In his view:\n:The idea that this meeting represented a 'submission', while it must remain a possibility, does however seem unlikely. The textual context of the chronicler's passage makes his interpretation of the meeting suspect, and ultimately, Edward was in no position to force the subordination of, or dictate terms to, his fellow kings in Britain.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|pp=206, 209}}\n\nEdward continued \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's policy of founding burhs in the north-west, at [[Thelwall]] and [[Manchester]] in 919, and ''Cledematha'' ([[Rhuddlan]]) at the mouth of the [[River Clwyd]] in North Wales in 921.{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=168}}\n\nNothing is known of his relations with the Mercians between 919 and the last year of his life, when he put down a Mercian and Welsh revolt at Chester. Mercia and the eastern Danelaw were organised into shires at an unknown date in the tenth century, ignoring traditional boundaries, and historians such as Sean Miller and David Griffiths suggest that Edward's imposition of direct control from 919 is a likely context for a change which ignored Mercian sensibilities. Resentment at the changes, at the imposition of rule by distant Wessex, and at fiscal demands by Edward's reeves, may have provoked the revolt at Chester. He died at the royal estate of Farndon, twelve miles south of Chester, on 24 July 924, shortly after putting down the revolt, and was buried in the New Minster, Winchester.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Griffiths|2y=2001|2pp=167, 182\u201383}} In 1109, the New Minster was moved outside the city walls to become [[Hyde Abbey]], and the following year the remains of Edward and his parents were translated to the new church.{{sfn|Doubleday|Page|1903|pp=116\u201322}}\n\n==Reputation==\nAccording to William of Malmesbury, Edward was \"much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters\", but \"incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule\". Other medieval chroniclers expressed similar views, and he was generally seen as inferior in book learning, but superior in military success. [[John of Worcester]] described him as \"the most invincible King Edward the Elder\". However, even as war leader he was only one of a succession of successful kings; his achievements were overshadowed because he did not have a famous victory like Alfred's at Edington and \u00c6thelstan's at [[Battle of Brunanburh|Brunanburh]], and William of Malmesbury qualified his praise of Edward by saying that \"the chief prize of victory, in my judgment, is due to his father\".{{efn|All quotations in this paragraph are from Higham, 'Edward the Elder's Reputation: An Introduction', pp. 2-3}} Edward has also been overshadowed by chroniclers' admiration for his highly regarded sister, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d.{{sfnm|1a1=Higham|1y=2001a|1pp=2\u20134|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2pp=40\u201341}}\n\nA principal reason for the neglect of Edward is that very few primary sources for his reign survive, whereas there are many for Alfred. He was largely ignored by historians until the late twentieth century, but he is now highly regarded. He is described by Keynes as \"far more than the bellicose bit between Alfred and \u00c6thelstan\",{{sfnm|1a1=Higham|1y=2001a|1pp=3\u20139|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2p=57}} and according to Nick Higham: \"Edward the Elder is perhaps the most neglected of English kings. He ruled an expanding realm for twenty-five years and arguably did as much as any other individual to construct a single, south-centred, Anglo-Saxon kingdom, yet posthumously his achievements have been all but forgotten.\" In 1999 a conference on his reign was held at the [[University of Manchester]], and the papers given on this occasion were published as a book in 2001. Prior to this conference, no monographs had been published on Edward's reign, whereas his father has been the subject of numerous biographies and other studies.{{sfn|Higham|2001a|pp=1\u20134}}\n\nIn the view of F. T. Wainwright: \"Without detracting from the achievements of Alfred, it is well to remember that it was Edward who reconquered the Danish Midlands and gave England nearly a century of respite from serious Danish attacks.\"{{sfn|Wainwright|1975|p= 77}} Higham summarises Edward's legacy as follows:\n:Under Edward's leadership, the scale of alternative centres of power diminished markedly: the separate court of Mercia was dissolved; the Danish leaders were in large part brought to heel or expelled; the Welsh princes were constrained from aggression of the borders and even the West Saxon bishoprics divided. Late Anglo-Saxon England is often described as the most centralised polity in western Europe at the time, with its shires, its shire-reeves and its systems of regional courts and royal taxation. If so \u2014 and the matter remains debatable \u2014 much of that centrality derives from Edward's activities, and he has as good a claim as any other to be considered the architect of medieval England.{{sfn|Higham|2001b|p=311}}\n\nEdward's [[cognomen]] 'the Elder' was first used in [[Wulfstan the Cantor|Wulfstan]]'s ''Life of St \u00c6thelwold'' at the end of the tenth century, to distinguish him from King [[Edward the Martyr]].{{sfn|Miller|2004}}\n\n==Marriages and children==\nEdward had about fourteen children from three marriages.{{efn| The order in which Edward's children are listed is based on the family tree in Foot's ''\u00c6thelstan: the First King of England'', which shows sons of each wife before daughters. The daughters are listed in their birth order according to William of Malmesbury's ''[[Gesta Regum Anglorum]]''.{{sfn|Foot|2011|p=xv}} The earliest primary sources do not distinguish whether Sihtric's wife was \u00c6thelstan's full or half sister, and a tradition recorded at Bury in the early twelfth century makes her a daughter of Edward's second wife, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d. She is described as the daughter of Edward and Ecgwynn in William of Malmesbury's twelfth century Deeds of the English Kings, and Michael Wood's argument that this is partly based on a lost early life of \u00c6thelstan has been generally accepted.{{sfnm|1a1=Thacker|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2pp=251\u201358}} Modern historians follow William of Malmesbury's testimony in showing her as \u00c6thelstan's full sister.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=1991|1pp=xxix, 123|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2p=xv|3a1=Miller|3y=2004}} William did not know her name, but some late sources name her as Edith or Eadgyth, an identification accepted by some historians.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Williams|2y=1991|2pp=xxix, 123}} She is also identified in late sources with saint Edith of Polesworth, a view accepted by Alan Thacker, but dismissed as \"dubious\" by Sarah Foot, who thinks that it is likely that she entered the cloister in widowhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Thacker|1y=2001|1pp=257\u201358|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2p=48|3a1=Foot|3y=2010|3p=243}}}}\n\nHe first married [[Ecgwynn]] around 893.{{sfn|Foot|2011|p=11}} Their children were:\n* [[\u00c6thelstan]], King of England 924\u2013939{{sfn|Miller|2004}}\n* A daughter, perhaps called Edith, married [[Sihtric C\u00e1ech|Sihtric]], Viking King of York in 926, who died in 927.

He was the elder son of [[Alfred the Great]] and his wife [[Ealhswith]]. When Edward succeeded to the throne, he had to defeat a challenge from his cousin [[\u00c6thelwold \u00e6theling|\u00c6thelwold]], who had a strong claim to the throne as the son of Alfred's elder brother and predecessor, [[\u00c6thelred I, King of Wessex|\u00c6thelred]].\n\nAlfred had succeeded \u00c6thelred as king of [[Wessex]] in 871, and almost faced defeat against the Danish [[Viking]]s until his decisive victory at the [[Battle of Edington]] in 878. After the battle, the Vikings still ruled [[Northumbria]], [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and eastern [[Mercia]], leaving only Wessex and western Mercia under Anglo-Saxon control. In the early 880s [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]], the ruler of western Mercia, accepted Alfred's lordship and married his daughter [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]], and around 886 Alfred adopted the new title King of the Anglo-Saxons as the ruler of all Anglo-Saxons not subject to Danish rule.\n\nIn 910 a Mercian and West Saxon army inflicted a decisive defeat on an invading Northumbrian army, ending the threat from the northern Vikings. In the 910s, Edward conquered Viking-ruled southern England in partnership with his sister \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, who had succeeded as Lady of the Mercians following the death of her husband in 911. Historians dispute how far Mercia was dominated by Wessex during this period, and after \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death in June 918, her daughter [[\u00c6lfwynn]], briefly became second Lady of the Mercians, but in December Edward took her into Wessex and imposed direct rule on Mercia. By the end of the 910s he ruled Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia, and only Northumbria remained under Viking rule. In 924 he faced a Mercian and Welsh revolt at [[Chester]], and after putting it down he died at [[Farndon, Cheshire|Farndon]] in [[Cheshire]] on 17 July 924. He was succeeded by his eldest son [[\u00c6thelstan]].\n\nEdward was admired by medieval chroniclers, and in the view of [[William of Malmesbury]], he was \"much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters\" but \"incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule\". He was largely ignored by modern historians until the 1990s, and [[Nick Higham (historian)|Nick Higham]] described him as \"perhaps the most neglected of English kings\", partly because few primary sources for his reign survive. His reputation rose in the late twentieth century and he is now seen as destroying the power of the Vikings in southern England while laying the foundations for a south-centred united English kingdom.\n\n==Background==\n[[Mercia]] was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by [[Wessex]] at the [[Battle of Ellandun]] in 825. Thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, which was to be an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings.{{sfn|Keynes and Lapidge|1983|pp=11\u201312}} In 865 the Danish Viking [[Great Heathen Army]] landed in [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] and used this as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians were forced to pay off the Vikings, who invaded [[Northumbria]] the following year. They appointed a puppet king in 867, and then moved on Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867\u2013868. King [[Burgred]] of Mercia was joined by King [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex]] and his brother, the future [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]], for a combined attack on the Vikings, who refused an engagement; in the end the Mercians bought peace with them. The following year, the Danes conquered East Anglia, and in 874 they expelled King Burgred and, with their support, [[Ceolwulf II of Mercia|Ceolwulf]] became the last King of Mercia. In 877 the Vikings partitioned Mercia, taking the eastern regions for themselves and allowing Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. In early 878 they invaded Wessex, and many West Saxons submitted to them. Alfred, who was now king, was reduced to a remote base in the [[Isle of Athelney]] in [[Somerset]], but the situation was transformed when he won a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Edington]]. He was thus able to prevent the Vikings from taking Wessex and western Mercia, although they still occupied Northumbria, East Anglia and eastern Mercia.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|pp=245\u201357}}\n\n==Childhood==\n[[File:Will of Alfred the Great (New Minster Liber Vitae) - BL Stowe MS 944, f 30v.jpg|thumb|A page from the will of Alfred the Great, which left the bulk of his estate to Edward]]\nEdward's parents, Alfred and [[Ealhswith]], married in 868. Her father was [[\u00c6thelred Mucel]], [[Ealdorman]] of the [[Gaini]], and her mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family. Alfred and Ealhswith had five children who survived childhood. The oldest was [[\u00c6thelfl\u00e6d]], who married [[\u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians]], and ruled as Lady of the Mercians after his death. Edward was next, and the second daughter, [[\u00c6thelgifu, abbess of Shaftesbury|\u00c6thelgifu]], became [[Shaftesbury Abbey|abbess of Shaftesbury]]. The third daughter, [[\u00c6lfthryth, Countess of Flanders|\u00c6lfthryth]], married [[Baldwin II, Margrave of Flanders|Baldwin, Count of Flanders]], and the younger son, [[\u00c6thelweard (son of Alfred)|\u00c6thelweard]], was given a scholarly education, including learning Latin. This would usually suggest that he was intended for the church, but it is unlikely in \u00c6thelweard's case as he later had sons. There were also an unknown number of children who died young. Neither part of Edward's name, which means 'protector of wealth', had been used previously by the West Saxon royal house, and [[Barbara Yorke]] suggests that he may have been named after his maternal grandmother Eadburh, reflecting the West Saxon policy of strengthening links with Mercia.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=25\u201328}}\n\nHistorians estimate that Edward was probably born in the mid-870s. His eldest sister, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, was probably born about a year after her parents' marriage, and Edward was brought up with his youngest sister, \u00c6lfthryth; Yorke argues that he was therefore probably nearer in age to \u00c6lfthryth than \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. Edward led troops in battle in 893, and must have been of marriageable age in that year as his oldest son \u00c6thelstan was born about 894.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1pp=25\u201326|2a1=Miller|2y=2004}} According to [[Asser]] in his ''Life of King Alfred'', Edward and \u00c6lfthryth were educated at court by male and female tutors, and read ecclesiastical and secular works in English, such as the [[Psalms]] and [[Old English poetry|Old English poems]]. They were taught the courtly qualities of gentleness and humility, and Asser wrote that they were obedient to their father and friendly to visitors. This is the only known case of an Anglo-Saxon prince and princess receiving the same upbringing.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n==\u00c6theling==\n[[File:Britain 886.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Map of Britain in 886]]\nAs a son of a king, Edward was an [[\u00e6theling]], a prince of the royal house who was eligible for kingship. Even though he had the advantage of being the eldest son of the reigning king, his accession was not assured as he had cousins who had a strong claim to the throne. [[\u00c6thelhelm]] and [[\u00c6thelwold of Wessex|\u00c6thelwold]] were sons of \u00c6thelred, Alfred's older brother and predecessor as king, but they had been passed over because they were infants when their father died. Asser gives more information about Edward's childhood and youth than is known about other Anglo-Saxon princes, providing details about the training of a prince in a period of [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] influence, and Yorke suggest that we may know so much due to Alfred's efforts to portray his son as the most throneworthy \u00e6theling.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=25, 29\u201330}}\n\n\u00c6thelhelm is only recorded in Alfred's will of the mid-880s, and probably died at some time in the next decade, but \u00c6thelwold is listed above Edward in the only [[charter]] where he appears, probably indicating a higher status. \u00c6thelwold may also have had an advantage because his mother Wulfthryth witnessed a charter as queen, whereas Edward's mother Ealhswith never had a higher status than king's wife.{{sfnm|1a1=\u00c6thelhelm|1y= PASE |2a1=S 356|2y=Sawyer|3a1=Yorke|3y=2001|3p=31}} However, Alfred was in a position to give his own son considerable advantages. In his will, he left only a handful of estates to his brother's sons, and the bulk of his property to Edward, including all his [[Bookland (law)|booklands]] (land vested in a charter which could be alienated by the holder, as opposed to folkland, which had to pass to [[heirs of the body]]) in [[Kent]].{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes and Lapidge|1y=1983|1pp=175\u201376, 321\u201322|2a1=Yorke|2y=2001|2p=30}} Alfred also advanced men who could be depended on to support his plans for his succession, such as his brother-in-law, a Mercian ealdorman called \u00c6thelwulf, and his son-in-law \u00c6thelred. Edward witnessed several of his father's charters, and often accompanied him on royal peregrinations.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=31\u201335}} In a Kentish charter of 898 Edward witnessed as ''rex Saxonum'', suggesting that Alfred may have followed the strategy adopted by his grandfather [[Egbert of Wessex|Egbert]] of strengthening his son's claim to succeed to the West Saxon throne by making him sub-king of Kent.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=32}}\n\nOnce Edward grew up, Alfred was able to give him military commands and experience in royal administration.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|pp=31\u201332}} The English defeated renewed Viking attacks in 893 to 896, and in [[Richard Abels]]' view, the glory belonged to \u00c6thelred and Edward rather than Alfred himself. In 893 Edward defeated the Vikings in the Battle of Farnham, although he was unable to follow up his victory as his troops' period of service had expired and he had to release them. The situation was saved by the arrival of troops from London led by \u00c6thelred.{{sfn|Abels|1998|pp=294\u2013304}} Yorke argues that although Alfred packed the [[witan]] with members whose interests lay in the continuation of Alfred's line, that may not have been sufficient to ensure Edward's accession if he had not displayed his fitness for kingship.{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=37}}\n\nIn about 893, Edward probably married [[Ecgwynn]], who bore him two children, the future King \u00c6thelstan and a daughter who married [[Sitric C\u00e1ech]], a Viking King of York. The twelfth-century chronicler [[William of Malmesbury]] described Ecgwynn as an ''illustris femina'' (noble lady), and stated that Edward chose \u00c6thelstan as his heir as king. She may have been related to St [[Dunstan]], the aristocratic tenth-century [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. But William of Malmesbury also stated that \u00c6thelstan's accession in 924 was opposed by a nobleman who claimed that his mother was a concubine of low birth.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1pp=33\u201334|2a1=Bailey|2y=2001|2p=114|3a1=Mynors, Thomson and Winterbottom|3y=1998|3p=199}} The suggestion that Ecgwynn was Edward's mistress is accepted by some historians such as [[Simon Keynes]] and Richard Abels,{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes|1y=1999|1p=467|2a1=Abels|2y=1998|2p=307}} but Yorke and \u00c6thelstan's biographer, [[Sarah Foot]], disagree, arguing that the allegations should be seen in the context of the disputed succession in 924, and were not an issue in the 890s.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2001|1p=33|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2p=31}} Ecgwynn probably died by 899, as around the time of Alfred's death Edward married [[\u00c6lffl\u00e6d, wife of Edward the Elder|\u00c6lffl\u00e6d]], the daughter of Ealdorman \u00c6thelhelm, probably of [[Wiltshire]].{{sfn|Yorke|2001|p=33}}\n\n[[Janet Nelson]] suggests that there was conflict between Alfred and Edward in the 890s. She points out that the contemporary ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', produced under court auspices in the 890s, does not mention Edward's military successes. These are known only from the late tenth century chronicle of [[\u00c6thelweard (historian)|\u00c6thelweard]], such as his account of the Battle of Farnham, in which in Nelson's view \"Edward's military prowess, and popularity with a following of young warriors, are highlighted\". Towards the end of his life Alfred invested his young grandson \u00c6thelstan in a ceremony which historians see as designation as eventual successor to the kingship. Nelson argues that while this may have been proposed by Edward to support the accession of his own son, on the other hand it may have been intended by Alfred as part of a scheme to divide the kingdom between his son and grandson. \u00c6thelstan was sent to be brought up in Mercia by \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d and \u00c6thelred, but it is not known whether this was Alfred's idea or Edward's. Alfred's wife Ealhswith was ignored in the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' in her husband's lifetime, but emerged from obscurity when her son acceded. This may be because she supported her son against her husband.{{sfn|Nelson|1996| pp= 53\u201354, 63\u201366}}\n\n==\u00c6thelwold's revolt==\n{{further|\u00c6thelwold's Revolt}}\n[[File:Coin of King Edward the Elder.JPG|thumb|240px|Coin of Edward the Elder]]\nAlfred died on 26 October 899 and Edward succeeded to the throne, but \u00c6thelwold disputed the succession.{{sfn|Miller|2004}} He seized the royal estates of [[Wimborne]], symbolically important as the place where his father was buried, and [[Christchurch, Dorset|Christchurch]], both in [[Dorset]]. Edward marched with his army to the nearby [[Iron Age]] hillfort at [[Badbury Rings]]. \u00c6thelwold declared that he would live or die at Wimborne, but then left in the night and rode to Northumbria, where the Danes accepted him as king.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=321|2a1=Lavelle|2y=2009|2pp=53, 61}} Edward was crowned on 8{{nbsp}}June 900 at [[Kingston upon Thames]].{{efn|The twelfth-century chronicler [[Ralph of Diceto]] stated that the coronation took place at Kingston, and this is accepted by [[Simon Keynes]], although [[Sarah Foot]] says that \"Edward might well have held the ceremony at Winchester\".{{sfnm|1a1=Keynes|1y=2001| 1p= 48|2a1= Foot|2y=2011| 2p= 74, n. 46}}}}\n\nIn 901, \u00c6thelwold came with a fleet to [[Essex]], and the following year he persuaded the East Anglian Danes to invade English Mercia and northern Wessex, where his army looted and then returned home. Edward retaliated by ravaging East Anglia, but when he retreated the men of Kent disobeyed the order to retire, and were intercepted by the Danish army. The two sides met at the [[Battle of the Holme]] (perhaps [[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme]] in [[Huntingdonshire]]) on 13 December 902. According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', the Danes \"kept the place of slaughter\", meaning that they won the battle, but they suffered heavy losses, including \u00c6thelwold and a King Eohric, possibly of the East Anglian Danes. Kentish losses included Sigehelm, ealdorman of Kent and father of Edward's third wife, Eadgifu. \u00c6thelwold's death ended the threat to Edward's throne.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1pp=321\u2013322|2a1=Hart|2y=1992|2pp=512\u201315|3a1=Miller|3y=2004}}\n\n==King of the Anglo-Saxons==\nIn London in 886 Alfred had received the formal submission of \"all the English people that were not under subjection to the Danes\", and thereafter he adopted the title ''Anglorum Saxonum rex'' (King of the Anglo-Saxons), which is used in his later charters and all but two of Edward's. This is seen by Keynes as \"the invention of a wholly new and distinctive polity\", covering both West Saxons and Mercians, which was inherited by Edward with the support of Mercians at the West Saxon court, of whom the most important was [[Plegmund]], Archbishop of Canterbury. In 903 Edward issued several charters concerning land in Mercia. Three of them are witnessed by the Mercian leaders and their daughter [[\u00c6lfwynn]], and they all contain a statement that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d \"then held rulership and power over the race of the Mercians, under the aforesaid king\". Other charters were issued by the Mercian leaders which did not contain any acknowledgment of Edward's authority, but they did not issue their own coinage.{{sfn|Keynes|2001|pp=44\u201358}} This view of Edward's status is accepted by Martin Ryan, who states that \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d had \"a considerable but ultimately subordinate share of royal authority\" in English Mercia.{{sfn|Ryan|2013|p=298}}\n\nOther historians disagree. [[Pauline Stafford]] describes \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as \"the last Mercian queen\",{{sfn|Stafford|2001|p=45}} while in Charles Insley's view Mercia kept its independence until \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death in 918.{{sfn|Insley|2009|p=330}} Michael Davidson contrasts the 903 charters with one of 901 in which the Mercian rulers were \"by grace of God, holding, governing and defending the monarchy of the Mercians\". Davidson comments that \"the evidence for Mercian subordination is decidedly mixed. Ultimately, the ideology of the 'Kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons' may have been less successful in achieving the absorption of Mercia and more something which I would see as a murky political coup.\" The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' was compiled at the West Saxon court from the 890s, and the entries for the late ninth and early tenth centuries are seen by historians as reflecting the West Saxon viewpoint; Davidson observes that \"Alfred and Edward possessed skilled 'spin doctors'\".{{sfnm|1a1=Davidson|1y=2001|1pp=203\u201305|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2p=43}} Some versions of the ''Chronicle'' incorporate part of a lost ''Mercian Register'', which gives a Mercian perspective and details of \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's campaign against the Vikings.{{sfn |Ryan|2013|p=298}}\n\nIn the late ninth and early tenth centuries, connection by marriage with the West Saxon royal house was seen as prestigious by continental rulers. In the mid-890s Alfred had married his daughter \u00c6lfthryth to Baldwin II of Flanders, and in 919 Edward married his daughter [[Eadgifu of Wessex|Eadgifu]] to [[Charles the Simple]], King of [[West Francia]]. In 925, after Edward's death, another daughter [[Eadgyth]] married [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto]], the future [[Kingdom of Germany|King of Germany]] and (after Eadgyth's death) [[Holy Roman Emperor]].{{sfn|Sharp|2001|pp=81\u201386}}\n\n==Conquest of the southern Danelaw==\nNo battles are recorded between the Anglo-Saxons and the Danish Vikings for several years after the [[Battle of the Holme]], but in 906 Edward agreed peace with the East Anglian and Northumbrian Danes, suggesting that there had been conflict. According to one version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' he made peace \"of necessity\", which implies that he was forced to buy them off.{{sfn|Miller|2004}} He encouraged Englishmen to purchase land in Danish territory, and two charters survive relating to estates in [[Bedfordshire]] and [[Derbyshire]].{{sfn|Abrams|2001|p=136}} In 909 Edward sent a combined West Saxon and Mercian army which harassed the Northumbrian Danes, and seized the bones of the Northumbrian royal saint [[Oswald of Northumbria|Oswald]] from [[Bardney Abbey]] in [[Lincolnshire]]. Oswald was [[Translation (relic)|translated]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|a new Mercian minster]] established by \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d in [[Gloucester]] and the Danes were compelled to accept peace on Edward's terms.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=323|2a1=Heighway|2y=2001|2p=108}} In the following year, the Northumbrian Danes retaliated by raiding Mercia, but on their way home they were met by a combined Mercian and West Saxon army at the [[Battle of Tettenhall]], where the Vikings suffered a disastrous defeat. After that, the Northumbrian Danes never ventured south of the River [[Humber]], and Edward and his Mercian allies were able to concentrate on conquering the southern Danelaw in East Anglia and the [[Five Boroughs]] of Viking east Mercia: [[Derby]], [[Leicester]], [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], [[Nottingham]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]].{{sfn|Miller|2004}} \n\nIn 911 \u00c6thelred, Lord of the Mercians, died, and Edward took control of the Mercian lands around London and [[Oxford]]. \u00c6thelred was succeeded as ruler by his widow \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d as Lady of the Mercians, and she had probably been acting as ruler for several years as \u00c6thelred seems to have been incapacitated in later life.{{sfnm|1a1=Stenton|1y=1971|1p=324, n. 1|2a1=Wainwright|2y=1975|2pp=308\u201309|3a1=Bailey|3y=2001|3p=113}}\n\nEdward and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d then began the construction of fortresses to guard against Viking attacks and protect territory captured from them. In November 911, he constructed a fort on the north bank of the [[River Lea]] at [[Hertford]] to guard against attack by the Danes of [[Bedford]] and [[Cambridge]]. In 912, he marched with his army to [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] in Essex, and ordered the building of a fort at [[Witham]] and a second fort at Hertford, which protected London from attack and encouraged many English living under Danish rule in Essex to submit to him. In 913 there was a pause in his activities, although \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d continued her fortress building in Mercia.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=324\u201325}} \n\nIn 914, a Viking army sailed from [[Brittany]] and ravaged the [[Severn]] estuary. It then attacked [[Ergyng]] in south-east Wales (now [[Archenfield]] in [[Herefordshire]]) and captured the Bishop, referred to as Cameleac, Cimeliauc and Cyfeilliog, depending on the source. Edward ransomed him for the large sum of forty pounds of silver. The Vikings were defeated in 915 by the armies of Hereford and Gloucester, and gave hostages and oaths to keep the peace. According to the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', one of the two jarls who had led the raids, Hroald, was killed, as was the brother of the other jarl.<ref>Worcester Manuscript, p. 99, quoted in {{cite web |url=https://htt.herefordshire.gov.uk/herefordshires-past/the-anglo-saxon-period/the-vikings/the-vikings-in-herefordshire/ |title=The Vikings in Herefordshire |date=2005|last=Greene|first=Miranda |publisher=Herefordshire Council |access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nEdward maintained an army on the south side of the estuary in case the Vikings broke their promises, and he twice had to repel attacks. In the autumn the Vikings moved on to Ireland. The episode suggests that south-east Wales fell within the West Saxon sphere of power, unlike [[Brycheiniog]] just to the north, where Mercia was dominant.{{sfnm|1a1=Charles-Edwards|1y=2013|1p=506|2a1=Miller|2y=2004}} In late 914 Edward built two forts at [[Buckingham]], and Earl Thurketil, the leader of the Danish army at Bedford submitted to him. The following year he occupied Bedford, and constructed another fortification on the south bank of the [[River Great Ouse]] against a Viking one on the north bank. In 916 Edward returned to Essex and built a fort at Maldon to bolster the defence of Witham. He also helped Earl Thurketil and his followers to leave England, reducing the number of Viking armies in the Midlands.{{sfn|Stenton|1971|pp=325\u201326}}\n\nThe decisive year in the war was 917. In April Edward built a fort at [[Towcester]] as a defence against the Danes of [[Northampton]], and another at an unidentified place called Wigingamere. The Danes launched unsuccessful attacks on Towcester, Bedford and Wigingamere, while \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d captured Derby, showing the value of the English defensive measures, which were aided by disunity and a lack of coordination among the Viking armies. The Danes had built their own fortress at [[Tempsford]] in Bedfordshire, but at the end of the summer the English stormed it and killed the last Danish king of East Anglia. The English then took [[Colchester]], although they did not try to hold it. The Danes retaliated by sending a large army to lay siege to Maldon, but the garrison held out until it was relieved and the retreating army was heavily defeated. Edward then returned to Towcester and reinforced its fort with a stone wall, and the Danes of nearby Northampton submitted to him. The armies of Cambridge and East Anglia also submitted, and by the end of the year the only Danish armies still holding out were those of four of the Five Boroughs, Leicester, Stamford, Nottingham, and Lincoln.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=327\u201329}}\n\nIn early 918, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d secured the submission of Leicester without a fight, and the Danes of Northumbrian York offered her their allegiance, probably for protection against [[Norwegians#Viking Age|Norse]] (Norwegian) Vikings who had invaded Northumbria from Ireland, but she died on 12 June before she could take up the proposal. The same offer is not known to have been made to Edward, and the Norse Vikings took York in 919. According to the main West Saxon version of the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', after \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death the Mercians submitted to Edward, but the Mercian version (the ''Mercian Register'') states that in December 918 her daughter \u00c6lfwynn \"was deprived of all authority in Mercia and taken into Wessex\". Mercia may have made a bid for continued semi-independence which was suppressed by Edward, and it then came under his direct rule. Stamford had surrendered to Edward before \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's death, and Nottingham did the same shortly afterwards. According to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for 918, \"all the people who had settled in Mercia, both Danish and English, submitted to him\". This would mean that he ruled all England south of the Humber, but it is not clear whether Lincoln was an exception, as coins of Viking York in the early 920s were probably minted at Lincoln.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Stenton|2y=1971|2pp=329\u201331}} Some Danish [[earl|jarls]] were allowed to keep their estates, although Edward probably also rewarded his supporters with land, and some he kept in his own hands. Coin evidence suggests that his authority was stronger in the East Midlands than in East Anglia.{{sfnm|1a1=Abrams|1y=2001|1pp=138\u201339|2a1=Lyon|2y=2001|2p=74}} Three Welsh kings, [[Hywel Dda]], Clydog and [[Idwal Foel]], who had previously been subject to \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, now gave their allegiance to Edward.{{sfn|Charles-Edwards|2013|pp=484, 498\u2013500}}\n[[File:Early-Medieval coin , Penny of Edward the Elder (FindID 223825).jpg|thumb|Penny of Edward the Elder|alt=Penny of Edward the Elder]]\n\n==Coinage==\nThe principal currency in later Anglo-Saxon England was the [[Penny (English coin)|silver penny]], and some coins carried a stylised portrait of the king. Edward's coins had \"EADVVEARD REX\" on the [[obverse]] and the name of the moneyer on the reverse. The places of issue were not shown in his reign, but they were in that of his son \u00c6thelstan, allowing the location of many moneyers of Edward's reign to be established. There were mints in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Canterbury]], Chester, [[Chichester]], Derby, [[Exeter]], [[Hereford]], London, Oxford, [[Shaftesbury]], [[Shrewsbury]], [[Southampton]], [[Stafford]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], [[Wareham, Dorset|Wareham]], Winchester and probably other towns. No coins were struck in the name of \u00c6thelred or \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, but from around 910 mints in English Mercia produced coins with an unusual decorative design on the reverse. This ceased before 920, and probably represents \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's way of distinguishing her coinage from that of her brother. There was also a minor issue of coins in the name of Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury. There was a dramatic increase in the number of moneyers over Edward's reign, fewer than 25 in the south in the first ten years rising to 67 in the last ten years, around five in English Mercia rising to 23, plus 27 in the conquered Danelaw.{{sfnm|1a1=Lyon|1y=2001|1pp=67\u201373, 77|2a1=Blackburn|2y=2014}}\n\n==Church==\nIn 908, Plegmund conveyed the alms of the English king and people to the Pope, the first visit to Rome by an Archbishop of Canterbury for almost a century, and the journey may have been to seek papal approval for a proposed re-organisation of the West Saxon sees.{{sfn|Brooks|1984|pp=210, 213}} When Edward came to the throne Wessex had two dioceses, [[Diocese of Winchester|Winchester]], held by [[Denewulf]], and [[Diocese of Sherborne|Sherborne]], held by Asser.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|pp=230\u201331}} In 908 Denewulf died and was replaced the following year by [[Frithestan]]; soon afterwards Winchester was divided into two sees, with the creation of the [[diocese of Ramsbury]] covering Wiltshire and [[Berkshire]], while Winchester was left with [[Hampshire]] and [[Surrey]]. Forged charters date the division to 909, but this may not be correct. Asser died in the same year, and at some date between 909 and 918 Sherborne was divided into three sees, [[Diocese of Crediton|Crediton]] covering [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]], and [[diocese of Wells|Wells]] covering Somerset, leaving Sherborne with Dorset.{{sfnm|1a1=Yorke|1y=2004b|2a1=Brooks|2y=1984|2pp=212\u201313}} The effect of the changes was to strengthen the status of Canterbury compared with Winchester and Sherborne, but the division may have been related to a change in the secular functions of West Saxon bishops, to become agents of royal government in shires rather than provinces, assisting in defence and taking part in shire courts.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|p=243}}\n\nAt the beginning of Edward's reign, his mother Ealhswith founded the abbey of St Mary for nuns, known as the [[Nunnaminster]], in Winchester.{{sfn|Rumble|2001|p=231}} Edward's daughter [[Eadburh of Winchester|Eadburh]] became a nun there, and she was venerated as a saint and the subject of a hagiography by [[Osbert of Clare]] in the twelfth century.{{sfn|Thacker|2001|pp=259\u201360}} In 901, Edward started building a major religious community for men, possibly in accordance with his father's wishes. The monastery was next to Winchester Cathedral, which became known as the [[Old Minster, Winchester|Old Minster]] while Edward's foundation was called the [[New Minster, Winchester|New Minster]]. It was much larger than the Old Minster, and was probably intended as a royal mausoleum.{{sfnm|1a1=Rumble|1y=2001|1pp=231\u201334|2a1=Marafioti|2y=2014|2pp=26\u201329}} It acquired relics of the Breton [[Saint Judoc]], which probably arrived in England from [[Ponthieu]] in 901, and the body of one of Alfred's closest advisers, [[Grimbald]], who died in the same year and who was soon venerated as a saint. Edward's mother died in 902, and he buried her and Alfred there, moving his father's body from the Old Minster. Burials in the early 920s included Edward himself, his brother \u00c6thelweard, and his son [[\u00c6lfweard of Wessex|\u00c6lfweard]]. On the other hand, when \u00c6thelstan became king in 924, he did not show any favour to his father's foundation, probably because Winchester sided against him when the throne was disputed after Edward's death. The only other king buried at the New Minster was [[Eadwig]], in 959.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2001|1pp=xxv\u2013xxix|2a1=Thacker|2y=2001|2pp=253\u201354}}\n\nEdward's decision not to expand the Old Minster, but rather to overshadow it with a much larger building, suggests animosity towards Bishop Denewulf, and this was compounded by forcing the Old Minster to cede both land for the new site, and an estate of 70 [[Hide (unit)|hides]] at [[Beddington]] to provide an income for the New Minster. Edward was remembered by the New Minster as a benefactor, but at the Old Minster as ''rex avidus'' (greedy king).{{sfnm|1a1=Rumble|1y=2001|1pp=234\u201337, 244|2a1=Thacker|2y=2001|2p=254}} He may have built the new church because he did not think that the Old Minster was grand enough to be the royal mausoleum for kings of the Anglo-Saxons, not just the West Saxons like their predecessors.{{sfn|Marafioti|2014|pp=28\u201331}} Alan Thacker comments:\n:Edward's method of endowing New Minster was of a piece with his ecclesiastical policy in general. Like his father he gave little to the church \u2014 indeed, judging by the dearth of charters for much of his reign he seems to have given away little at all{{nbsp}}... More than any other, Edward's kingship seems to epitomise the new hard-nosed monarchy of Wessex, determined to exploit all its resources, lay and ecclesiastical, for its own benefit.{{sfn|Thacker|2001|p=254}} \n[[Patrick Wormald]] observes: \"The thought occurs that neither Alfred nor Edward was greatly beloved at Winchester Cathedral; and one reason for Edward's moving his father's body into the new family shrine next door was that he was surer of sincere prayers there.\"{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=274\u201375}}\n\n==Learning and culture==\nThe standard of Anglo-Saxon learning declined severely in the ninth century, particularly in Wessex, and Mercian scholars such as Plegmund played a major part in the revival of learning initiated by Alfred. Mercians were prominent at the courts of Alfred and Edward, and the Mercian dialect and scholarship commanded West Saxon respect.{{sfn|Gretsch|2001|p=287}} It is uncertain how far Alfred's programmes continued during his son's reign. English translations of works in Latin made during Alfred's reign continued to be copied, but few original works are known. The script known as Anglo-Saxon Square [[Carolingian minuscule|minuscule]] reached maturity in the 930s, and its earliest phases date to Edward's reign. The main scholarly and scriptorial centres were the cathedral centres of Canterbury, Winchester and Worcester; monasteries did not make a significant contribution until \u00c6thelstan's reign.{{sfn|Lapidge|1993|pp=12\u201316}} Very little survives of the manuscript production of Edward's reign.{{sfn|Higham|2001a|p=2}}\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxon art#Textile art|only surviving large scale embroideries]] which were certainly made in Anglo-Saxon England date to Edward's reign. They are a [[Stole (vestment)|stole]], a maniple and a possible [[girdle]] removed from the coffin of [[St Cuthbert]] in [[Durham Cathedral]] in the nineteenth century. They were donated to the shrine by \u00c6thelstan in 934, but inscriptions on the embroideries show that they were commissioned by Edward's second wife, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d, as a gift to Frithestan, [[Bishop of Winchester]]. They probably did not reach their intended destination because \u00c6thelstan was on bad terms with Winchester.{{sfnm|1a1=Coatsworth|1y=2001|1pp=292\u201396|2a1=Wilson|2y=1984|2p=154}}\n\n==Law and administration==\nAlmost all surviving charters from Edward's reign are later copies, and the only surviving original is not a charter of Edward himself, but a grant by \u00c6thelred and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d in 901.{{sfn|Lapidge|1993|p=13}} In the same year a meeting at Southampton was attended by his brother and sons, his household [[thegn]]s and nearly all bishops, but no ealdormen. It was on this occasion that the king acquired land from the Bishop of Winchester for the foundation of the New Minster, Winchester. No charters survive for the period from 910 to the king's death in 924, much to the puzzlement and distress of historians. Charters were usually issued when the king made grants of land, and it is possible that Edward followed a policy of retaining property which came into his hands to help finance his campaigns against the Vikings.{{sfn|Keynes|2001|pp=50\u201351, 55\u201356}} Charters rarely survive unless they concerned property which passed to the church and were preserved in their archives, and another possibility is that Edward was making grants of property only on terms which ensured that they returned to male members of the royal house; such charters would not be found in church archives.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|p=275}}\n\nClause 3 of the law code called ''I Edward'' provides that people convincingly charged with perjury shall not be allowed to clear themselves by oath, but only by [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal]].

There was increasing confusion in the period as to what was really bookland; Edward urged prompt settlement in bookland and folkland disputes, and his legislation established that jurisdiction belonged to the king and his officers.{{sfn|Wormald|2001|pp=264, 276}}\n\n==Later life==\nAccording to the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', there was a general submission of rulers in Britain to Edward in 920:\n:Then [Edward] went from there into the [[Peak District]] to [[Bakewell]] and ordered a borough to be built in the neighbourhood and manned. And then the king of the Scots and all the people of the Scots, and [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair|R\u00e6gnald]] and the sons of [[Eadwulf II of Northumbria|Eadwulf]]{{efn|R\u00e6gnald was the Norse Viking king of York in southern Northumbria, and Eadwulf was the Anglo-Saxon ruler of northern Northumbria, which was not conquered by the Vikings.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|p=205}} }} and all who live in Northumbria, both English and Danish, Norsemen and others, and also the king of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|Strathclyde]] Welsh and all the Strathclyde Welsh, chose him as father and lord.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|pp=200\u201301}}\nThis passage was regarded as a straightforward report by most historians until the late twentieth century,{{sfn|Davidson|2001|p=201}} and [[Frank Stenton]] observed that \"each of the rulers named in this list had something definite to gain from an acknowledgement of Edward's overlordship\".{{sfn|Stenton|1971|p=334}} Since the 1980s this submission has been viewed with increasing scepticism, particularly as the passage in the ''Chronicle'' is the only evidence for it, unlike other submissions such as that one in 927 to \u00c6thelstan, for which there is independent support from literary sources and coins.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|pp=206\u201307}} [[Alfred P. Smyth]] points out that Edward was not in a position to impose the same conditions on the Scots and the Northumbrians as he could on conquered Vikings, and argues that the ''Chronicle'' presented a treaty between kings as a submission to Wessex.{{sfn|Smyth|1984|p=199}} Stafford observes that the rulers had met at [[Bakewell]] on the border between Mercia and Northumbria, and that meetings on borders were generally considered to avoid any implication of submission by either side.{{sfn|Stafford|1989|p=33}} Davidson points out that the wording \"chosen as father and lord\" applied to conquered army groups and burhs, not relations with other kings. In his view:\n:The idea that this meeting represented a 'submission', while it must remain a possibility, does however seem unlikely. The textual context of the chronicler's passage makes his interpretation of the meeting suspect, and ultimately, Edward was in no position to force the subordination of, or dictate terms to, his fellow kings in Britain.{{sfn|Davidson|2001|pp=206, 209}}\n\nEdward continued \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's policy of founding burhs in the north-west, at [[Thelwall]] and [[Manchester]] in 919, and ''Cledematha'' ([[Rhuddlan]]) at the mouth of the [[River Clwyd]] in North Wales in 921.{{sfn|Griffiths|2001|p=168}}\n\nNothing is known of his relations with the Mercians between 919 and the last year of his life, when he put down a Mercian and Welsh revolt at Chester. Mercia and the eastern Danelaw were organised into shires at an unknown date in the tenth century, ignoring traditional boundaries, and historians such as Sean Miller and David Griffiths suggest that Edward's imposition of direct control from 919 is a likely context for a change which ignored Mercian sensibilities. Resentment at the changes, at the imposition of rule by distant Wessex, and at fiscal demands by Edward's reeves, may have provoked the revolt at Chester. He died at the royal estate of Farndon, twelve miles south of Chester, on 24 July 924, shortly after putting down the revolt, and was buried in the New Minster, Winchester.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Griffiths|2y=2001|2pp=167, 182\u201383}} In 1109, the New Minster was moved outside the city walls to become [[Hyde Abbey]], and the following year the remains of Edward and his parents were translated to the new church.{{sfn|Doubleday|Page|1903|pp=116\u201322}}\n\n==Reputation==\nAccording to William of Malmesbury, Edward was \"much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters\", but \"incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule\". Other medieval chroniclers expressed similar views, and he was generally seen as inferior in book learning, but superior in military success. [[John of Worcester]] described him as \"the most invincible King Edward the Elder\". However, even as war leader he was only one of a succession of successful kings; his achievements were overshadowed because he did not have a famous victory like Alfred's at Edington and \u00c6thelstan's at [[Battle of Brunanburh|Brunanburh]], and William of Malmesbury qualified his praise of Edward by saying that \"the chief prize of victory, in my judgment, is due to his father\".{{efn|All quotations in this paragraph are from Higham, 'Edward the Elder's Reputation: An Introduction', pp. 2-3}} Edward has also been overshadowed by chroniclers' admiration for his highly regarded sister, \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d.{{sfnm|1a1=Higham|1y=2001a|1pp=2\u20134|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2pp=40\u201341}}\n\nA principal reason for the neglect of Edward is that very few primary sources for his reign survive, whereas there are many for Alfred. He was largely ignored by historians until the late twentieth century, but he is now highly regarded. He is described by Keynes as \"far more than the bellicose bit between Alfred and \u00c6thelstan\",{{sfnm|1a1=Higham|1y=2001a|1pp=3\u20139|2a1=Keynes|2y=2001|2p=57}} and according to Nick Higham: \"Edward the Elder is perhaps the most neglected of English kings. He ruled an expanding realm for twenty-five years and arguably did as much as any other individual to construct a single, south-centred, Anglo-Saxon kingdom, yet posthumously his achievements have been all but forgotten.\" In 1999 a conference on his reign was held at the [[University of Manchester]], and the papers given on this occasion were published as a book in 2001. Prior to this conference, no monographs had been published on Edward's reign, whereas his father has been the subject of numerous biographies and other studies.{{sfn|Higham|2001a|pp=1\u20134}}\n\nIn the view of F. T. Wainwright: \"Without detracting from the achievements of Alfred, it is well to remember that it was Edward who reconquered the Danish Midlands and gave England nearly a century of respite from serious Danish attacks.\"{{sfn|Wainwright|1975|p= 77}} Higham summarises Edward's legacy as follows:\n:Under Edward's leadership, the scale of alternative centres of power diminished markedly: the separate court of Mercia was dissolved; the Danish leaders were in large part brought to heel or expelled; the Welsh princes were constrained from aggression of the borders and even the West Saxon bishoprics divided. Late Anglo-Saxon England is often described as the most centralised polity in western Europe at the time, with its shires, its shire-reeves and its systems of regional courts and royal taxation. If so \u2014 and the matter remains debatable \u2014 much of that centrality derives from Edward's activities, and he has as good a claim as any other to be considered the architect of medieval England.{{sfn|Higham|2001b|p=311}}\n\nEdward's [[cognomen]] 'the Elder' was first used in [[Wulfstan the Cantor|Wulfstan]]'s ''Life of St \u00c6thelwold'' at the end of the tenth century, to distinguish him from King [[Edward the Martyr]].{{sfn|Miller|2004}}\n\n==Marriages and children==\nEdward had about fourteen children from three marriages.{{efn| The order in which Edward's children are listed is based on the family tree in Foot's ''\u00c6thelstan: the First King of England'', which shows sons of each wife before daughters. The daughters are listed in their birth order according to William of Malmesbury's ''[[Gesta Regum Anglorum]]''.{{sfn|Foot|2011|p=xv}} The earliest primary sources do not distinguish whether Sihtric's wife was \u00c6thelstan's full or half sister, and a tradition recorded at Bury in the early twelfth century makes her a daughter of Edward's second wife, \u00c6lffl\u00e6d. She is described as the daughter of Edward and Ecgwynn in William of Malmesbury's twelfth century Deeds of the English Kings, and Michael Wood's argument that this is partly based on a lost early life of \u00c6thelstan has been generally accepted.{{sfnm|1a1=Thacker|1y=2001|1p=257|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2pp=251\u201358}} Modern historians follow William of Malmesbury's testimony in showing her as \u00c6thelstan's full sister.\"{{sfnm|1a1=Williams|1y=1991|1pp=xxix, 123|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2p=xv|3a1=Miller|3y=2004}} William did not know her name, but some late sources name her as Edith or Eadgyth, an identification accepted by some historians.{{sfnm|1a1=Miller|1y=2004|2a1=Williams|2y=1991|2pp=xxix, 123}} She is also identified in late sources with saint Edith of Polesworth, a view accepted by Alan Thacker, but dismissed as \"dubious\" by Sarah Foot, who thinks that it is likely that she entered the cloister in widowhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Thacker|1y=2001|1pp=257\u201358|2a1=Foot|2y=2011|2p=48|3a1=Foot|3y=2010|3p=243}}}}\n\nHe first married [[Ecgwynn]] around 893.{{sfn|Foot|2011|p=11}} Their children were:\n* [[\u00c6thelstan]], King of England 924\u2013939{{sfn|Miller|2004}}\n* A daughter, perhaps called Edith, married [[Sihtric C\u00e1ech|Sihtric]], Viking King of York in 926, who died in 927.

Studies of modern grey wolves have identified distinct sub-populations that live in close proximity to each other.<ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=schweizer2016a/> This variation in sub-populations is closely linked to differences in habitat \u2013 precipitation, temperature, vegetation, and prey specialization \u2013 which affect cranio-dental plasticity.<ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nThe archaeological and paleontological records show grey wolf continuous presence for at least the last 300,000 years.<ref name=sotnikova2010/> This continuous presence contrasts with genomic analyses, which suggest that all modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=fan2016/> that existed as recently as 20,000 years ago.<ref name=freedman2014/> These analyses indicate a [[population bottleneck]], followed by a rapid radiation from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original wolf populations were out-competed by a new type of wolf which replaced them. However, the geographic origin of this radiation is not known.\n\n==Fossil record==\n{{further|Canis#Taxonomy|label1=Evolution of Canis|Canidae#Phylogenetic relationships|label2=Canid relationships}}\n[[File:Canisetr.JPG|thumb|''Canis etruscus'' skull in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum.]]\n\nThe fossil record for ancient vertebrates is composed of rarely occurring fragments from which it is often impossible to obtain genetic material. Researchers are limited to [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic analysis]] but it is difficult to estimate the intra-species and inter-species variations and relationships that existed between specimens across time and place. Some observations are debated by researchers who do not always agree, and hypotheses that are supported by some authors are challenged by others.<ref name=sardella2014/>\n\nThere is general agreement on the most ancient record, which shows that [[Feliformia|feliform]]s and [[Caniformia|caniform]]s emerged within the super-family [[Carnivoramorpha]] 43 million [[years before present]] (YBP).<ref name=flynn2005/> The caniforms included the fox-like genus ''[[Leptocyon]]'' whose various species existed from 34 million YBP before branching 11.9 million YBP into ''[[Vulpes]]'' (foxes) and [[Canis|Canini]] (canines). The jackal-sized ''[[Eucyon]]'' existed in North America from 10 million YBP and by the [[Early Pliocene]] about 6\u20135 million YBP the coyote-like ''[[Eucyon#Eucyon davisi|Eucyon davisi]]''<ref name=fossilworks5/> invaded Eurasia. In North America it gave rise to early ''Canis'' which first appeared in the [[Miocene]] (6 million YBP) in south-western US and Mexico. By 5 million YBP the larger ''[[Canis lepophagus]]'' appeared in the same region.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p58}}\n\nThe canids that had immigrated from North America to Eurasia \u2013 ''[[Eucyon]]'', ''[[Vulpes]]'', and ''[[Nyctereutes]]'' \u2013 were small to medium-sized predators during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene but they were not the top predators. The position of the canids would change with the arrival of ''Canis'' to become a dominant predator across the [[Holarctic]]. The wolf-sized ''[[Evolution of the wolf#Canis chihliensis|C. chihliensis]]'' appeared in northern China in the Mid-Pliocene around 4\u20133 million YBP.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p148}} The large wolf-sized ''Canis'' appeared in the Middle [[Pliocene]] about 3 million years ago in the Yushe Basin, [[Shanxi]] Province, China. By 2.5 million years ago its range included the Nihewan Basin in [[Yangyuan County]], [[Hebei]], China and Kuruksay, Tadzhikistan.<ref name=vislobokova2003/> This was followed by an explosion of ''Canis'' evolution across Eurasia in the Early Pleistocene around 1.8 million YBP in what is commonly referred to as the ''wolf event''. It is associated with the formation of the [[mammoth steppe]] and continental glaciation. ''Canis'' spread to Europe in the forms of ''[[Canis arnensis|C. arnensis]]'', ''[[Canis etruscus|C. etruscus]]'', and ''[[Canis falconeri|C. falconeri]]''.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p148}}\n\nThe fossil record is incomplete but it is likely that wolves arose from a population of small, early canids.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p241}} Morphological evidence<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p239}}<ref name=nowak1979/> and genetic evidence<ref name=wayne1995/> both suggest that wolves evolved during the [[Pliocene]] and Early [[Pleistocene]] eras from the same lineage that also led to the coyote,<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p239}} with fossil specimens indicating that the coyote and the wolf diverged from a common ancestor 1.5 million years ago.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p240}}<ref name=nowak1979/> The ancestor of the jackal and the other extant members of the genus ''Canis'' had split from the lineage before this time.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p240}}\n\nAfter this separation from a common ancestor the species that were believed to be involved in the further evolution of the wolf and coyote \u2013 and the beliefs of some [[Paleontology|paleontologists]] \u2013 diverged.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p240}} A number of researchers believed that the lines of ''[[Canis edwardii|C. priscolatrans]]'', ''C. etruscus'', ''[[Canis rufus|C. rufus]]'' and ''[[Canis lupus|C. lupus]]'' were components involved in some way that lead to the modern wolf and coyote.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p240}}<ref name=hoffmeister1954/><ref name=lawrence1967/><ref name=lawrence1975/><ref name=martin1974/><ref name=webb1974/><ref name=wayne1991/>\n\n{{Cladogram|title=Wolf evolution|caption=Proposed evolution and branching of genus ''Canis'' towards the wolf.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p240}} \n|cladogram={{clade |style=font-size:75%; line-height:65%;width:450px;\n |label1=\u2020''[[Canis lepophagus]]'' \n |1={{clade\n  |label1=''[[Canis latrans]]'' (Coyote)\n  |1={{clade\n   |1=[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).jpg|50 px]]\n  }}  \n  |label2=\u2020''Canis priscolatrans''\n  |2={{clade\n   |1=extinct taxa\n   |label2=\u2020[[Canis ambrusteri]]  \n   |2={{clade \n    |label1=\u2020''[[Canis dirus]]'' (Dire wolf)\n    |1=[[File:The American Museum journal (c1900-(1918)) (Canis dirus).jpg|80 px]]\n    |label2=\u2020''[[Canis nehringi]]'' \n    |2=[[File:Large sized canid icon.jpg|50 px]]\n    |label3=\u2020''[[Canis nehringi#Canis gezi|Canis gezi]]'' \n    |3={{clade\n     |1=[[File:Large sized canid icon.jpg|50 px]]\n     }}  \n    }}\n   }}\n  |label3=\u2020''Canis etruscus'' \n  |3={{clade\n   |1=\u2020[[Canis variabilis]][[File:Canis lupus variabilis.jpg|50 px]]\n   |label2=\u2020[[Evolution of the wolf#Canis mosbachensis|Canis mosbachensis]]''\n   |2={{clade \n    |label1=''[[Canis rufus]]'' (red wolf)\n    |1=[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate V) C. l. rufus mod.jpg|50 px]]\n    |label2=''[[Canis lupus]]'' (gray wolf)\n    |2=[[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).jpg|50 px]]\n    |label3=''[[Canis familiaris]]'' (dog)\n    |3={{clade\n     |1=[[File:Tibetan mastiff (white background).jpg|50 px]]\n     }}\n    }}\n   }}\n  }}\n }}\n}}\n\n===''Canis lepophagus''===\n''[[Canis lepophagus]]'' lived in the early Pliocene in North America.<ref name=wang2008/> [[Bj\u00f6rn Kurt\u00e9n|Kurten]] proposed that the [[Blancan]] ''C. lepophagus''<ref name=fossilworks1/> derived from smaller [[Miocene]] ''Canis'' species in North America.

Moreover, domestic dogs occupy a range of novel shapes outside the domain of wild carnivorans.\"<ref name=drake2010/>\n\nThe domestic dog compared to the wolf shows the greatest variation in the size and shape of the skull (Evans 1979) that range from 7 to 28&nbsp;cm in length (McGreevy 2004). Wolves are [[dolichocephaly|dolichocephalic]] (long skulled) but not as extreme as some breeds of such as greyhounds and Russian wolfhounds (McGreevy 2004). Canine [[brachycephaly]] (short-skulledness) is found only in domestic dogs and is related to [[paedomorphosis]] (Goodwin 1997). Puppies are born with short snouts, with the longer skull of dolichocephalic dogs emerging in later development (Coppinger 1995). Other differences in head shape between brachycephalic and dolichocephalic dogs include changes in the craniofacial angle (angle between the [[Basilar plexus|basilar axis]] and [[hard palate]]) (Regod\u00f3n 1993), morphology of the [[temporomandibular joint]] (Dickie 2001), and radiographic anatomy of the [[cribriform plate]] (Schwarz 2000).<ref name=roberts2010/>\n\nNowak indicated that orbital angle of the eye socket is an important characteristic defining the difference between the dog and the wolf, with the wolf having the lower angle.

The orbital angle of the eye socket was clearly larger in the dog than in the coyote and the wolf; why it was almost the same as that of the dire wolf was not commented on.<ref name=nowak1979/>\n\nMany authors have concluded that compared to the adult extant wolf, the adult domestic dog has a relatively reduced rostrum (front part of the skull), an elevated [[frontal bone]], a wider [[palate]], a broader [[cranium]], and smaller teeth (Hildebrand1954; Clutton-Brock, Corbet & Hills 1976; Olsen 1985; Wayne 1986; Hemmer 1990; Morey 1990). Other authors have disagreed and have stated that these traits can overlap and vary within the two (Crockford 1999; Harrison 1973). Wolf cubs have similar relative skull proportions as adult dogs and this was proposed as evidence that the domestic dog is a [[Neoteny|neotenic wolf]]. This was proposed to be due to either  human selection for juvenile appearance or due to a [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] effect as a result of selection for juvenile behavior (Clutton-Brock 1977; Belyaev 1979; Wayne 1986; Coppinger and Schneider 1995). Wayne (1986) concluded that his dog samples did not have significant relative shortening of the rostrum compared to wolves, calling this identification feature into question.<ref name=koler2002/> A 2004 study that used 310 wolf skulls and over 700 dog skulls representing 100 breeds concluded that the evolution of dog skulls can generally not be described by heterochronic processes such as neoteny although some pedomorphic dog breeds have skulls that resemble the skulls of juvenile wolves.<ref name=drake2004>Drake, Abby Grace, \"Evolution and development of the skull morphology of canids: An investigation of morphological integration and heterochrony\" (January 1, 2004).

However, Kieser and Groeneveld (1992) compared the mandibulo-dental measurements of jackals (''C. adustus, C. mesomelas'') and Cape foxes (''Vulpes chama'') to equivalent-sized dogs and found that the canines of these other canids tended to be slightly smaller and their second molars larger compared to dogs, otherwise the proportions were essentially the same in all species. They concluded that \"...the teeth of canids appear to have evolved in concert with one another and relatively independently of differences in dimorphism, size or functional demands\". This calls into question the assumption that dog teeth are relatively small due to recent selection, suggesting that dog dentition is plesiomorphic from an ancestor that was smaller than the wolf.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe reduced body size of the early dog compared to a wolf is thought due to niche selection (Olsen 1985; Morey 1992; Coppinger &\nCoppinger 2001). Morey (1992:199) states that \"Results...are consistent with a hypothesis that early domestic dogs are evolutionary paedomorphs, products of strong selection for ontogenetically channeled size reduction and alterations of reproductive timing associated with the new domestic way of life.\"<ref name=koler2002/> However, in an domestication experiment the domesticated foxes remained the same size as unselected foxes (Trutt 1999:167).<ref name=morey2015/>\n\nWayne (1986) concluded that the dog is closer in skull morphology to ''C. latrans, C. aureus, C. adustus, C. mesomelas, Cuon alpinus'' and ''Lycaon pictus'' than to the wolf. Dahr (1942) concluded that the shape of the dog brain case is closer to that of the coyote than to that of the wolf. Manwell and Baker (1983) reviewed Dahr's work with the addition of dental data for canids and concluded that the dog ancestor was probably within the range of 13.6\u201320.5&nbsp;kg, which is smaller than the range 27\u201354&nbsp;kg for extant wolves (Mech 1970) and is comparable with the [[Dingo]].<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe auditory [[Tympanic part of the temporal bone|bulla]] of the dog is relatively smaller and flatter than that of the wolf (Harrison 1973; Clutton-Brock, Corbet & Hill 1976; Nowak 1979; Olsen 1985; Wayne 1986), which is proposed to be due to relaxed selection under domestication as the dog no longer required the acute hearing of the wolf. However, bulla shape has been shown to facilitate increased sensitivity to specific frequencies but shape and size may not be correlated with acuity (Ewer 1973). Therefore, the observed difference could be that the dog bulla has retained its ancestral shape.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe ventral edge of the dog's horizontal [[ramus of the mandible]] has a convex curve that does not exist in the wolf (Olsen 1985; Clutton-Brock 1995), and no discussion of this difference could be found in the literature. However, Biknevicius and Van Valkenburgh (1997) noticed that the horizontal ramus of bone-processing predators is thicker dorso-ventrally at the point [[Anatomical terms of location#caudal|caudal]] to the site of bone processing. This thickening may have been a function for niche adaptation by the dog's ancestor.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nA description of the superficial brain morphology of jackals (''C. mesomelas, C. aureus''), coyotes (''C. latrans''), wolves (''C. lupus, C. rufus''), and dogs indicated that the [[cerebellum]] of the dog closely approximates that of the coyote, which is closely aligned with the jackals, and that the wolves show numerous brain traits distinct from the other species (Atkins and Dillon 1971). Wolves also have serological and biochemical traits distinct from dogs (Leone and Wiens 1956; Lauer, Kuyt & Baker 1969).<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum, there was greater wolf [[genetic diversity]] than there is today,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=thalmann2013/> and within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.<ref name=perri2016/> One author has proposed that the most likely explanation for the different morphological characteristics of the dog compared to the wolf is that the dog's ancestor was adapted to a different niche than the wolf.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\n==Genetic record==\n\n===DNA sequences===\nThe [[mitochondria]] within each [[Cell (biology)|cell]] contain many copies of a small circular [[DNA genome]] and in mammals it is 16,000\u201318,000 [[base pairs]] in length.

There is evidence of gene flow between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackals]], and gray wolves. The study suggests that the African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically [[genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72% grey [[wolf]] and 28% [[Ethiopian wolf]] ancestry, and that the Ethiopian wolf once had a wider range in Africa. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] showed high admixture with the Middle Eastern gray wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and Eurasian continents in canid evolution. There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. The study proposes that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American gray wolves. The study indicates that the common ancestor of the [[coyote]] and gray wolf has genetically [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid.  The canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and has evolved after the divergence of the African hunting dog from the other canid species. The [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] position of the coyote compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unknown canid.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\nA genomic study on the wolves of China included museum specimens of wolves from southern China that were collected between 1963-1988. The wolves in the study formed 3 clades: [[Himalayan wolf]], north Asian wolves that incuded those from northern China and eastern Russia, and a unique population from southern China. One specimen from [[Jiangxi]] province in eastern China shared gene flow with the the wolves from southern China, however its genome was 12-14 percent admixed with a canid that may be the dhole or an unknown canid that predates the genetic divergence of the dhole.

A comparison of current and past frequencies indicated that in Europe haplogroup 2 became outnumbered by haplogroup 1 over the past several thousand years<ref name=miklosi2015/> but in North America haplogroup 2 became extinct and was replaced by haplogroup 1 after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/> Access into North America was available between 20,000\u201311,000 years ago after the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] had retreated but before the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] became inundated by the sea.<ref name=tamm2007/> Therefore, haplogroup 1 was able to enter into North America during this period.\n\nStable [[isotope analysis]] conducted on the bone of a specimen allows researchers to form conclusions about the diet, and therefore the ecology, of extinct wolf populations. This analysis suggests that the Pleistocene wolves from haplogroup 2 found in [[Beringia]] and Belgium preyed mainly on Pleistocene megafauna,<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=leonard2007/> which became rare at the beginning of the Holocene 12,000 years ago.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2010/> One study found the Beringian wolf to be [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to all other gray wolves except for the extant [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]] and the extant [[Himalayan wolf]].<ref name=leonard2007/> The Pleistocene Eurasian wolves have been found to be morphologically and genetically comparable to the Pleistocene eastern-[[Beringian wolf|Beringian wolves]],<ref name=germonpre2013/> with some of the ancient European and Beringian wolves sharing a common haplotype (a17),<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=leonard2007/> which makes ecological similarity likely.<ref name=pilot2010/> Two ancient wolves from the Ukraine dated around 30,000 YBP and the 33,000 YBP [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog \u2013 33,000 YBP|\"Altai dog\"]] had the same sequence as six Beringian wolves, and another from the Czech Republic dated 44,000 YBP had the same sequence as two Beringian wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/>\n\nIt has been proposed that the Pleistocene wolves across northern Eurasia and northern North America represented a continuous and almost [[Panmixia|panmictic]] population that was genetically and probably also ecologically distinct from the wolves living in this area today.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2007/> The specialized Pleistocene wolves did not contribute to the genetic diversity of modern wolves, and the modern wolf populations across the Holarctic are likely to be the descendants of wolves from populations that came from more southern refuges.<ref name=hofreiter2007/> Extant haplogroup 2 wolves can be found in Italy, the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains but rare elsewhere in Europe. In Asia, only four haplotypes have been identified as belonging to this haplogroup, and two of them occur in the Middle East.<ref name=pilot2014/> Haplogroup 2 did not become extinct in Europe, and if before the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] haplogroup 2 was exclusively associated with the wolf ecomorph specialized in preying on megafauna, it would mean that in Europe it was capable of adapting to changing prey.<ref name=pilot2010/>\n\nIn 2013, a mitochondrial DNA sequencing of ancient wolf-like canids revealed another separate lineage of 3 haplotypes (forming a haplogroup) that was found in 3 Late Pleistocene specimens from Belgium; however, it has not been detected in extant wolves.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=pilot2014/> One of these was the [[Paleolithic dog#Goyet dog \u2013 36,000 YBP|\"Goyet dog\"]].<ref name=thalmann2013/>\n\n====Dissenting view====\n[[File:Phylogenetic tree for wolves.jpg|thumb|mDNA [[phylogenetic tree]] for wolves.

[[Beringian wolf]] (Alaska 28,000 YBP) haplotype found in the modern clade XVI from China.]]\nIn 2016, a study was undertaken due to concerns that previous mDNA studies may have been conducted with insufficient genetic resolution or limited geographical coverage and had not included sufficient specimens from Russia, China, and the Middle East. The study compared a 582 [[base pair]] [[DNA sequences|sequence]] of the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] which gave twice the phylogenetic resolution of the 2010 study.<ref name=pilot2010/> The study compared the sequences of both modern wolves and ancient wolf specimens, including specimens from the remote areas of North America, Russia and China. The study included the [[#Taimyr wolf|Taimyr wolves]], the [[Paleolithic dog#Goyet dog \u2013 36,000 YBP|Goyet \"dog\"]], the [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog \u2013 33,000 YBP|Altai \"dog\"]], Beringian wolves, and other ancient specimens.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\nThe study found 114 different wolf haplotypes among 314 sequences, with the new haplotypes being found in Siberia and China. The phylogenetic tree resolved into 19 clades that included both modern and ancient wolves, which showed that the most basal clades included the [[Indian wolf#Canis Indica|Indian gray wolf]] and the [[Himalayan wolf]], with a subclade of wolves from China and Mongolia falling within the Himalayan wolf clade. The two most basal North American haplotypes included the [[Mexican wolf]] and the [[Vancouver Island wolf]], however the Vancouver Island wolf showed the same haplotype as a dog which indicates admixture,<ref name=ersmark2016/> with the dog lineage basal to all extant North American subspecies.<ref name=fan2016/> In Europe, the two most genetically distinct haplotypes form the [[Iberian wolf]] and separately the [[Italian wolf]] that was positioned close to the ancient wolves. The [[Greenland wolf|Greenland wolves]] all belonged to one haplotype that had been previously found among North American wolves and which indicates their origin from North America. The Eastern wolf was confirmed as a coyote/wolf hybrid. Wolves found in the regions of the [[Chukotka Peninsula]], the North Korean border, [[Amur Oblast]] and [[Khakassia]] showed the greatest genetic diversity and with close links to all other wolves found across the holarctic. One ancient haplotype that had been found in Alaska (Eastern Beringia 28,000 YBP) and Russia (Medvezya \"Bear\" Cave, [[Pechora]] area, Northern [[Urals]] 18,000 YBP) was shared with some modern wolves found in China and Mongolia.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\nThe previous finding of two wolf haplogroups<ref name=pilot2010/> was not clearly delineated in this study but it agreed that the genetic diversity of past wolves has been lost at the beginning of the Holocene in Alaska, Siberia, and Europe with limited overlap with modern wolves. For the ancient wolves of North America, instead of an extinction/replacement model suggested by a previous study,<ref name=leonard2007/> this study found substantial evidence of a population bottleneck in North America in which the ancient wolf diversity was almost lost around the beginning of the Holocene (no further elaboration in the study). In Eurasia, the loss of ancient lineages could not be simply explained and appears to have been slow across time with the reasons unclear.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\n===Into America and Japan===\n{{See also|Japanese wolf|Ezo Wolf}}\n[[File:Beringia land bridge-noaagov.gif|right|320px|Shrinking of the Bering land bridge]]\n[[File:Japan glaciation.gif|thumb|right|Japanese archipelago 20,000 years ago with Hokkaido island bridged to the mainland, thin black line indicates present-day shoreline]]\n\nIn 2016, a study built on the work of another major study<ref name=thalmann2013/> and analyzed the sequences of 12 genes that are located on the [[heavy strand]] of the mitochondrial genome of extinct and modern ''C. lupus''. The study excluded the sequences of the divergent [[Himalayan wolf]] and the [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]]. The ancient specimens were [[radiocarbon dated]] and [[Stratigraphy|stratagraphically]] dated, and together with the sequences generated a time-based phylogenetic tree. From the tree, the study was able to infer the most recent common ancestor for all other ''C. lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct \u2013 was 80,000 YBP and this date concurred with the earlier study.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> The study could find no evidence of a population bottleneck for wolves until a few thousand years ago.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nThe phylogenetic tree showed the [[polyphyly]] of American wolves, the Mexican wolf was divergent from other North American wolves, and these other North American wolves formed two closely related clades. A scenario consistent with the phylogenetic, ice sheet and sea-level data was that during the Ice Age when sea levels were at their lowest, there was a single wave of wolf colonization into North America starting with the opening of the [[Bering land bridge]] 70,000 YBP and closing during the [[Late Glacial Maximum]] of the Yukon corridor that ran through the division between the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] and the [[Cordilleran Ice Sheet]] 23,000 YBP. Mexican wolves were part of the single wave and either diverged from the other wolves before entering North America or once in North America due to the change in its environment.\n\nAs wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but modern wolves could trace their ancestry back  only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through admixture.<ref name=koblmuller2016/> The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one supported the findings of earlier studies.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/><ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> There possibly existed a panmictic wolf population with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America until the closing of the ice sheets.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2007/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> Once the sheets closed, the southern wolves were isolated and north of the sheets only the [[Beringian wolf]] existed. The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000 YBP, the sheets receded 12,000\u20136,000 YBP, the Beringian wolf went extinct and the southern wolves expanded to recolonize the rest of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the ice sheets. However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nStudies using [[mitochondrial DNA]] have indicated that the wolves of coastal south-east Alaska are genetically distinct from inland gray wolves, reflecting a pattern also observed in other taxa. They show a phylogenetic relationship with extirpated wolves from the south (Oklahoma), indicating that these wolves are the last remains of a once widespread group that has been largely extirpated during the last century, and that the wolves of northern North America had originally expanded from southern refuges below the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] after the ice had melted at the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=weckworth2005/><ref name=weckworth2010/><ref name=weckworth2011/> A [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome]] DNA study indicated that all North American wolves were [[monophyletic]] and therefore are the descendants of a common ancestor.<ref name=vonholdt2016/>\n\nDuring the same period, the [[Soya Strait]] between [[Hokkaido]] and [[Sakhalin Island]] was dry for 75,000 years and it was proposed that the extinct [[Ezo Wolf|Ezo wolf]] (''C. l. hattai'') arrived on Hokkaido from Sakhalin.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/><ref name=abe1999/> However, the sequences indicated that it arrived in Hokkaido less than 10,000 YBP. The Ezo wolf was closely related to one of the North American clades,<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/><ref name=ishiguro2010/> but different to the more southerly [[Japanese wolf]] (''C. l. hodophilax'') that was basal to modern wolves.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> The Japanese wolf inhabited Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu islands<ref name=walker2008/><ref name=ishiguro2009/> but not Hokkaido Island.<ref name=ishiguro2009/> This indicates that its ancestor may have migrated from the Asian continent through the Korean Peninsula into Japan.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=ishiguro2009/> The past sea levels of the [[Korean Strait]] together with the timing of the Japanese wolf sequences indicated that it arrived to the southern islands less than 20,000 YBP.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nThe dog was a very successful invader of North America and had established a widespread [[ecological niche]] by the Early\u2013Middle Holocene. There was no overlap in niche between the dog and the wolf in comparison to the dog and other North American canids. By the Late Holocene, the dog's niche area was less in size than researchers had expected to find, indicating that it was limited by [[Biotic component|biotic factors]]. These regions include the northeast and northwest of the United States that correlate with the greatest densities of early human occupation, indicating that the dog had \"defected\" from the wolf niche to the human niche and explains why the dog's niche area was not as large as expected. The separation between dog and wolf may reflect the rapid rate in which domestication occurred,<ref name=pardi2016/> including the possibility of a second domestication event occurring in North America.<ref name=witt2015/><ref name=pardi2016/> Packs of wolves and hunter-gatherers hunt similar prey in a similar way within a similar group social structure that may have facilitated wolf domestication.<ref name=hall1978/><ref name=olsen1985/>\n\nThe wolf was exterminated in the southern part of their historic geographical range in North America by the middle of the 20th century. An mDNA study of 34 wolf remains from North America dated between 1856 and 1915 found their genetic diversity to be twice that of modern wolves in these regions, and two thirds of the haplotypes identified were unique. These results indicate that a historic population of several hundred thousand wolves once existed in Mexico and the western US.<ref name=leonard2004/><ref name=miklosi2015/>\n\n===Beringia===\nGrey wolves suffered a species-wide [[population bottleneck]] (reduction) approximately 25,000 YBP during the Last Glacial Maximum. This was followed by a single population of modern wolves expanding out of a [[Beringia#Beringian refugium|Beringia refuge]] to repopulate the wolf's former range, replacing the remaining Late Pleistocene wolf populations across Eurasia and North America as they did so.<ref name=Loog2018/><ref name=Werhahn2018/><ref name=Schweizer2020/> This source population probably did not give rise to dogs, but admixed with dogs which allowed them to gain coat colour genes that are also related to immunity, and provided dogs with genes which allowed them to adapt to high-altitude environments (e.g. Tibet). This suggests that the genetic divergence of European and East Asian dogs could be based on admixture with different sub-populations of wolves.<ref name=Schweizer2020/>\n\nThere is little genetic information available on the ancient wolves that existed prior to the bottleneck. However, studies show that one or more of these ancient populations is more directly ancestral to dogs than are modern wolves, and conceivably these were more prone to domestication by the first humans to invade Eurasia.<ref name=Schweizer2020/>\n\n===Divergence with the coyote===\nIn 1993, a study proposed that the wolves of North America display skull traits more similar towards the coyote than those wolves from  Eurasia.<ref name=goulet1993/> In 2016, a [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome]] DNA study proposed, based on the assumptions made, that all of the North American wolves and coyotes diverged from a common ancestor less than 6,000\u2013117,000 years ago. The study also indicated that all North America wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the [[red wolf]] and [[eastern wolf]] are highly [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. One test indicated a wolf/coyote divergence time of 51,000 years before present that matched other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time. Another test indicated that the red wolf diverged from the coyote between 55,000\u2013117,000 years before present and the Great Lakes region wolf 32,000 years before present. Other tests and modelling showed various divergence ranges and the conclusion was a range of less than 6,000 and 117,000 years before present.<ref name=vonholdt2016/><ref name=virginia2016/> This finding conflicts with the fossil record that indicates a coyote-like specimen dated to 1 million years before present.<ref name=wang2008/>\n\nThe modern gray wolf expanded out of Beringia 25,000 years ago. This implies that if the coyote and red wolf were derived from this invasion, their histories date only tens of thousands and not hundreds of thousands of years ago, which is consistent with other studies.<ref name=Schweizer2020/>\n\n{{further|Pleistocene coyote}}\n\n===Domestic dog===\n{{further|Origin of the domestic dog}}\n\nThe domestic dog (''Canis lupus familiaris'') is the most widely abundant large carnivore.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=fan2016/><ref name=vila1999/> Over the past million years, numerous wolf-like forms existed but their turnover has been high, and modern wolves are not the lineal ancestors of dogs.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=fan2016/><ref name=leonard2004/> Although research had suggested that dogs and wolves were genetically very close relatives,<ref name=vila1997/><ref name=wayne1999/><ref name=wayne1993/> later [[phylogenetic analysis]] strongly supported the hypothesis that dogs and wolves are reciprocally [[monophyly|monophylic]] [[taxa]] that form two sister [[clades]].<ref name=vila1997/><ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=larson2014/> This suggests that none of the modern wolf populations are related to the wolves that were first domesticated and the wolf ancestor of dogs is therefore presumed extinct.<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=larson2014/> Recent [[mitochondrial DNA]] analyses of ancient and modern gray wolf specimens supports a pattern of population reduction and turnover.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=leonard2007/> An alternate proposal is that during the ecological upheavals of the Late Pleistocene all of the remaining members of a dwindling lineage joined humans.<ref name=morey2016/><ref name=morey2015/>\n\nIn 2016, a study investigated for the first time the population subdivisions, demography, and the relationships of gray wolves based on their [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome sequences]]. The study indicated that the dog was a divergent subspecies of the gray wolf and was derived from a now-extinct [[ghost population]] of Late Pleistocene wolves,<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=fan2016/> and the dog and the dingo are not separate species.<ref name=fan2016/> The genome-wide [[phylogenetic tree]] indicated a [[genetic divergence]] between New World and Old World wolves, which was then followed by a divergence between the dog and Old World wolves 27,000YBP<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=fan2016/> \u2013 29,000 YBP.<ref name=fan2016/> The dog forms a sister taxon with Eurasian gray wolves but not North American wolves.

Glaciation may have caused its habitat loss, genetic isolation then local adaption.<ref name=fan2016/>\n\nThe study indicated that there has been extensive [[genetic admixture]] between domestic dogs and wolves, with up to 25% of the genome of Old World wolves showing signs of dog ancestry, possibly as the result of [[gene flow]] from dogs into wolves that were ancestral to all modern wolves. There was evidence of significant gene flow between the European wolves plus the Israeli wolf with the [[basenji]] and [[Boxer (Dog)|boxer]], which suggests admixture between the lineages ancestral to these breeds and wolf populations.<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=fan2016/> For the lowland Asian wolves: the Central Russian and East Russian wolves and all of the lowland Chinese wolves had significant gene flow with the Chinese indigenous dogs, the [[Tibetan Mastiff]] and the [[dingo]].

Past studies based on SNPs, genome-wide similarities with Chinese wolves, and lower [[linkage disequilibrium]] might reflect regional admixture between dogs with wolves and gene flow between dog populations, with divergent dog breeds possibly maintaining more wolf ancestry in their genome. The study proposed that analysis of ancient DNA might be a better approach.<ref name=fan2016/>\n\nIn the same year, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs.

This implies that the ancestry of the majority of gray wolf populations today stems from an ancestral population that lived less than 35,000&nbsp;years ago but before the inundation of the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] with the subsequent isolation of Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nA comparison of the ancestry of the Taimyr-1 lineage to the dog lineage indicated that some modern dog breeds have a closer association with either the gray wolf or Taimyr-1 due to [[Genetic admixture|admixture]]. The [[Saarloos wolfdog]] showed more association with the gray wolf, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with gray wolves in this breed. Taimyr-1 shared more alleles (gene expressions) with those breeds that are associated with high latitudes: the [[Siberian husky]] and [[Greenland dog]]<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=gross2015/> that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the [[Shar Pei]] and [[Finnish spitz]]. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, although an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taimyr-1 population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. These results can be explained either by a very early presence of dogs in northern Eurasia or by the genetic legacy of Taimyr-1 being preserved in northern wolf populations until the arrival of dogs at high latitudes. This [[introgression]] could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates that the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nAn attempt to explore admixture between Taimyr-1 and gray wolves produced unreliable results.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nAs the Taimyr wolf had contributed to the genetic makeup of the Arctic breeds, a later study suggested that descendants of the Taimyr wolf survived until dogs were domesticated in Europe and arrived at high latitudes where they mixed with local wolves, and these both contributed to the modern Arctic breeds. Based on the most widely accepted oldest zooarchaeological dog remains, domestic dogs most likely arrived at high latitudes within the last 15,000&nbsp;years. The mutation rates calibrated from both the Taimyr wolf and the [[Origin of the domestic dog#Two domestication events|Newgrange dog]] genomes suggest that modern wolf and dog populations diverged from a common ancestor between 20,000\u201360,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]]. This indicates that either dogs were domesticated much earlier than their first appearance in the archaeological record, or they arrived in the Arctic early, or both.<ref name=machugh2016/>\n\nThe finding of a second wolf specimen from the same area (\u201c''Taimry-2''\u201d) and dated to 42,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]] has also been sequenced but yielded only mitochondrial DNA.<ref name=ersmark2016b/>\n\n===''Canis variabilis''===\nIn 2015, a study looked at the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] sequences of 13 ancient canid remains and one modern wolf from five sites across Arctic north-east Siberia. The fourteen canids revealed nine mitochondrial [[haplotype]]s, three of which were on record and the others not reported before. The phylogentic tree generated from the sequences showed that four of the Siberian canids dated 28,000 YBP and one [[Canis lupus variabilis|''Canis c.f. variabilis'']] dated 360,000 YBP were highly divergent. The haplotype designated as S805 (28,000 YBP) from the [[Yana River]] was one mutation away from another haplotype S902 (8,000 YBP) that represents Clade A of the modern wolf and domestic dog lineages. Closely related to this haplotype was one that was found in the recently-extinct [[Japanese wolf]]. Several ancient haplotypes were oriented around S805, including ''Canis c.f. variabilis'' (360,000 YBP), Belgium (36,000 YBP \u2013 the \"Goyet dog\"), Belgium (30,000 YBP), and Konsteki, Russia (22,000 YBP). Given the position of the S805 haplotype on the phylogenetic tree, it may potentially represent a direct link from the [[progenitor]] (including ''Canis c.f. variabilis'') to the domestic dog and modern wolf lineages. The gray wolf is thought to be ancestral to the domestic dog, however its relationship to ''C. variabilis'', and the genetic contribution of ''C. variabilis'' to the dog, is the subject of debate.<ref name=lee2015/>\n\nThe [[Zhokhov Island]] (8,700 YBP) and Aachim (1,700 YBP) canid haplotypes fell within the domestic dog clade, cluster with S805, and also share their haplotypes with \u2013 or are one mutation away from \u2013 the [[Tibetan wolf]] (''C. l. filchneri'') and the recently-extinct Japanese wolf (''C. l. hodophilax''). This may indicate that these canids retained the genetic signature of admixture with regional wolf populations. Another haplotype designated as S504 (47,000 YBP) from [[Silene stenophylla#Duvanny Yar|Duvanny Yar]] appeared on the phylogenetic tree as not being connected to wolves (both ancient and modern) yet ancestral to dogs, and may represent a genetic source for regional dogs.<ref name=lee2015/>\n\nThe authors concluded that the structure of the modern dog [[gene pool]] was contributed to from ancient Siberian wolves and possibly from ''Canis c.f. variabilis''.<ref name=lee2015/><ref name=Irizarry2018/>\n\n==Rise to dominant predator==\nIn 2015, a study looked at the paleoecology of large carnivores across the [[Mammoth steppe]] during the [[Late Pleistocene]] by using stable isotope analysis of their fossil [[collagen]] to reconstruct their diets. Based on testing in Belgium, around 40,000 YBP the [[Cave hyena]]s preyed on mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horses and reindeer, with [[Panthera leo spelaea|cave lion]]s taking reindeer and young [[cave bear]]s. Wolves appear to have been out-competed by [[cave hyena]]s and had their diet restricted to chamois, giant deer and red deer. However, after the Last Glacial Maximum around 14,000 YBP, wolves had access to all prey species, the cave lion was restricted to reindeer, and the cave hyena had gone extinct.<ref name=bocherens2011/><ref name=yeakel2013/><ref name=bocherens2015/> The data suggests that the extinction of the cave hyena allowed the wolf to become the dominant predator rather than the cave lion, just before the cave lion's extinction.<ref name=bocherens2015/> Another study indicated that the wolf thrived compared to the cave hyena when there was greater snow cover.<ref name=dinnis2016/>\n\n==Wolf population differences==\n{{See also|Beringian wolf|Cave wolf|Megafaunal wolf|Paleolithic dog}}\n\nThe grey wolf ''Canis lupus'' is a highly adaptable species that is able to exist in a range of environments and which possesses a wide distribution across the [[Holarctic]]. Studies of modern grey wolves have identified distinct sub-populations that live in close proximity to each other.<ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=schweizer2016a/> This variation in sub-populations is closely linked to differences in habitat \u2013 precipitation, temperature, vegetation, and prey specialization \u2013 which affect cranio-dental plasticity.<ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=leonard2014/> The archaeological and paleontological records show their continuous presence for at least the last 300,000 years.<ref name=sotnikova2010/> This continuous wolf presence contrasts with [[Genome|genomic]] studies, which suggest that all modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=fan2016/> that existed as recently as 20,000 years ago.<ref name=freedman2014/> These studies indicate that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid radiation from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original wolf populations were out-competed by a new type of wolf which replaced them.<ref name=koblmuller2016/> However, the geographic origin of this radiation is not known.\n\nApart from domestication, humans have harmed the wolf by restricting its habitat through persecution. This has caused a dramatic decrease in its population size over the last two centuries.<ref name=boitani2003/><ref name=leonard2005/> The shrinking of its habitats that overlap with those of close-relatives such as dogs and coyotes have led to numerous occurrences of hybridization.<ref name=vonholdt2011/><ref name=vonholdt2013/> These events, in addition to recent turnovers (extinctions and repopulations by other geneotypes), has made the unravelling of the [[Phylogeography|phylogeographic]] history of the wolf difficult.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\n===Ecotypes===\n\nAn [[ecotype]] is a variant in which the [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences are too few or too subtle to warrant being classified as a subspecies. These can occur in the same geographic region where distinct habitats such as meadow, forest, swamp, and sand dunes provide ecological niches. Where similar ecological conditions occur in widely separated places it is possible for a similar ecotype to occur. This is different to a subspecies, which may exist across a number of different habitats. In animals, ecotypes can be regarded as micro-subspecies that owe their differing characteristics to the effects of a very local environment.<ref name=mayr1999/> Ecotypes have no [[taxonomic rank]].\n\nGray wolves have a wide, natural distribution across the [[Holarctic]] that includes many different habitats, which can vary from the high arctic to dense forests, open steppe and deserts. The genetic differences between different populations of gray wolves is tightly linked to the type of habitat in which they live.<ref name=leonard2014/> Differences in genetic markers among the Scandinavian wolf population has arisen in only just over a decade due to their small population size,<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=vila2003/> which indicates that these differences are not dependent on a long time spent in isolation and that larger population patterns can evolve in just a few thousand years.<ref name=leonard2014/> These differences can also include fur color and density, and body size.<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=munoz2009/><ref name=musiani2007/> The differences can also include behavior, as coastal wolves eat fish<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=munoz2009/> and tundra wolves migrate.<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=musiani2007/> These differences have been observed between two wolf populations that are living in close proximity. It has been shown that mountain wolves do not interbreed with nearby coastal wolves, and the Alps of France and Switzerland have been repopulated with wolves from the mountains of nearby Italy<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=valiere2003/> and from the far away mountains of Croatia<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=fabbri2014/> rather than from the nearer lowlands, which indicates that distance is not the driving force in differences between the two [[Ecomorphology|ecomorphs]].<ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nIn 2013, a genetic study found that the wolf population in Europe was divided along a north\u2013south axis and formed five major clusters. Three clusters were identified occupying southern and central Europe in Italy, the Carpathians, and the Dinaric-Balkans. Another two clusters were identified occupying north-central Europe and the Ukrainian steppe. The Italian wolf consisted of an isolated population with low genetic diversity. Wolves from Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece formed the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. Wolves from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia formed the north-central Europe cluster with wolves from the Carpathians cluster a mixture of wolves from the north-central cluster and the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. The wolves from the Carpathians were more similar to the wolves from the Ukrainian Steppe than they were to wolves from north-central Europe. These clusters may have been the result of expansion from glacial refugia, an adaptation to local environments, and landscape fragmentation and the killing of wolves in some areas by humans.<ref name=stronen2013/>\n\nIn 2016, two studies compared the sequences of 42,000 [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] in North American gray wolves and found that they formed six ecotypes. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables on sequence variation.<ref name=schweizer2016a/><ref name=schweizer2016b/> These findings were in accord with previous findings that precipitation influenced morphology,<ref name=okeefe2013/> and that vegetation<ref name=geffen2004/> and habitat type<ref name=munoz2009/><ref name=carmichael2007/> influenced wolf differences. One of these studies found that the variation in 11 key genes affected wolf vision, sense of smell, hearing, coat color, metabolism, and immunity. The study identified 1,040 genes that are potentially under selection due to habitat variation, and therefore that there was evidence of local adaption of the wolf ecotypes at a molecular level. Most notable was the positive selection of genes that influence vision, coat color, metabolism and immunity in the Artic and High Arctic ecotypes, and that the British Columbia ecotype also has a unique set of adaptions.<ref name=schweizer2016b/> The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference to remain in the type of habitat that it was born into.<ref name=schweizer2016a/>\n\nEcological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence gray wolf [[population genetics|genetic population structure]] and cranio-dental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]].<ref name=hofreiter2010/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=carmichael2001/><ref name=carmichael2006/><ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/> During the Last Glacial Maximum, there was greater wolf [[genetic diversity]] than there is today,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=thalmann2013/> and within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.<ref name=perri2016/>\n\n===Pleistocene wolves===\nThe oldest ''Canis'' remains found in Europe were from France and dated to 3.1 million YBP,<ref name=lacombat2008/> followed by ''Canis cf. etruscus'' (where [[Open nomenclature#Usage of open nomenclature|cf.]] in Latin means confer, uncertain) from Italy dated to 2.2 million YBP.<ref name=rook1996/> ''C. lupus'' first appeared in Italy during [[Marine Isotope Stage]] 9<ref name=gliozzi1997/> (337,000 YBP). In Britain, it was the only canid species present from MIS 7 (243,000 YBP), with the oldest record from [[Pontnewydd Cave]] in north Wales.<ref name=currant1984/> During the Ice Age, Britain was separated from Europe by only the [[Channel River]].\n\nA study of Pleistocene ''C. lupus'' in Britain at different time periods found that its abilities to crush, slice meat and eat bone highlighted its cranio-dental plasticity. These responses to dietary changes showed species-wide dietary shifts, and not just local ecomorphs, in response to climatic and ecological variables. The survival of ''C. lupus'' during the Pleistocene can be attributed largely to its plastic cranio-dental morphology.<ref name=flower2014/>\n[[File:Unnatural selection, 2 heads, one species.jpg|thumb|220px|right|''Canis lupus'' cranio-dental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] \u2013 grey wolf and chihuahua skulls.]]\n[[File:Wolf_mandible_diagram.jpg|thumb|right|Wolf mandible diagram showing the names and positions of the teeth.]]\n[[File:Scandinavian grey wolf Canis lupus.jpg|thumb|right|Scandinavian wolf in forest habitat]]\n[[File:Beringian wolf reconstruction.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Artist's impression of a [[Beringian wolf]]]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Comparison of ''Canis lupus'' variation in Britain from 243,000 YBP (MIS refers to [[Marine isotope stage]])\n! scope=\"col\" | Time YBP\n! scope=\"col\" | Variables\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 243,000 [[Marine isotope stage|MIS]] 7\n| Paleoenvironment was open grasslands with summer temperatures between 16&nbsp;\u00b0C and 23&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperatures between \u22127&nbsp;\u00b0C and \u22126&nbsp;\u00b0C dominated by steppe mammoth and horse. Competitors included the lion, brown bear, and rarely the spotted hyena. The wolves of MIS 7 were slightly smaller in body size than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today. These wolves were out-competed by the larger competitors, leading to a more omnivorous diet with increased crushing ability in an open environment that supported more types of prey and more non-meat foods than the MIS 5 period. They had shallower and narrower jaws than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today, which indicated that they could take only small to medium-sized prey.

A large form of brown bear was top predator, with no hyena at this time. The wolves of MIS 5 were larger in body size than those found in Sweden today. These wolves suffered from a severe climate, low prey availability and dietary stress leading to a more carnivorous diet, with increased scavenging of frozen carcasses and bone consumption. They developed strong jaws and the highest flesh-slicing ability compared to the other wolves, with shallower jaws than the modern wolf but broader and deeper jaws than MIS 7 and MIS 5 wolves. They exhibited the longest and narrowest upper P4 that suggests improved slicing ability, and longest upper M1 and M2 but with reduced width and therefore reduced crushing ability, indicating a hypercarnivore. They exhibited a higher percentage of tooth breakage and severely worn teeth compared to the other wolves, and may have been using their upper P4 and lower m1 to crush bone rather than their molars, leading to a higher frequency of damage.<ref name=flower2014/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 57,000 MIS 3\n| Paleoenvironment of open grasslands with summer temperature of around 12&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperature around \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C dominated by woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, and giant deer.

The prey species includes elk, reindeer, roe deer, boar, hares, rabbit, and beaver. Competitors include the brown bear and lynx but the wolf is top carnivore. The wolves found in Sweden today are smaller in body size than MIS 5 wolves but larger than those of MIS 7 and MIS 3.  The upper M1 and M2 length is longer than for MIS 7 and MIS 3 wolves, and the jaws deeper and broader, which indicates the ability to hunt and subdue large prey. However, the large molars retained a crushing ability and to process non-meat foods. These wolves live in boreal forests where small to medium game is hard to detect and labour-intensive to subdue, leading to an adaption for hunting larger game with higher reward. They are hypercarnivores similar to MIS 5 wolves but not with the same slicing ability.<ref name=flower2014/> \n|-\n|}\n\nDuring the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] 20,000 YBP, the [[Mammoth steppe|Pleistocene steppe]] stretched across northern and central Eurasia and through [[Beringia]] into North America. The Pleistocene [[Beringian wolf|wolves of Beringia]], and perhaps those across the steppe, were adapted to this habitat. Their tooth and skull morphology indicates that they specialized in preying on now-extinct [[Pleistocene megafauna]], and their tooth wear indicates that their behavior was different to modern wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=fox2008/><ref name=baryshnikov2009/> This highlights the success of ''C. lupus'' as a species in adapting to different environmental conditions.<ref name=flower2014/> This gray wolf ecomorph became extinct at the end of the glaciation, along with the horse and other species on which it depended, and was replaced by wolves from southern North America. This indicates that specialized wolf ecomorphs can become extinct when their environment changes even though the habitat may still support other wolves.<ref name=leonard2014/> Wolves went through a [[population bottleneck]] 20,000 YBP that coincides with the Last Glacial Maximum,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=pilot2014/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=leonard2014/> which indicates that many wolf populations may have gone extinct at the same time as the Beringian wolves.<ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nThere are a small number of ''Canis'' remains that have been found at Goyet Cave, Belgium (36,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2009/> Razboinichya Cave, Russia (33,500 YBP)<ref name=ovodov2011/>  Kostenki 8, Russia (33,500\u201326,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2015/> Predmosti, Czech Republic (31,000 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2012/> and Eliseevichi 1, Russia (17,000 YBP).<ref name=sablin2002/> Based on cranial morphometric study of the characteristics thought to be associated with the domestication process, these have been proposed as early Paleolithic dogs.<ref name=germonpre2015/> These characteristics of shortened rostrum, tooth crowding, and absence or rotation of premolars have been documented in both ancient and modern wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=boudadi2010/><ref name=dimitrijevic2015/><ref name=crockford2012/> Rather than representing early dogs, these specimens may represent \"a morphologically distinct local, now extinct, population of wolves\".<ref name=perri2016/><ref name=larson2012/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=abe1999>{{cite book|last=Abe|first=H.|year=1999|chapter=Diversity and conservation of mammals of Japan|editor-last=Yokohata|editor-first=Y.|editor2-last=Nakamura|editor2-first=S.|title=Recent Advances in the Biology of Japanese Insectivore|publisher=Hiba Society of Natural History|location=[[Sh\u014dbara, Hiroshima|Sh\u014dbara]]|pages=89\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=aggarwal2007>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aggarwal | first1 = R.

Studies of modern grey wolves have identified distinct sub-populations that live in close proximity to each other.<ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=schweizer2016a/> This variation in sub-populations is closely linked to differences in habitat \u2013 precipitation, temperature, vegetation, and prey specialization \u2013 which affect cranio-dental plasticity.<ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nThe archaeological and paleontological records show grey wolf continuous presence for at least the last 300,000 years.<ref name=sotnikova2010/> This continuous presence contrasts with genomic analyses, which suggest that all modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=fan2016/> that existed as recently as 20,000 years ago.<ref name=freedman2014/> These analyses indicate a [[population bottleneck]], followed by a rapid radiation from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original wolf populations were out-competed by a new type of wolf which replaced them. However, the geographic origin of this radiation is not known.\n\n==Fossil record==\n{{further|Canis#Taxonomy|label1=Evolution of Canis|Canidae#Phylogenetic relationships|label2=Canid relationships}}\n[[File:Canisetr.JPG|thumb|''Canis etruscus'' skull in the [[Montevarchi]] Paleontological Museum.]]\n\nThe fossil record for ancient vertebrates is composed of rarely occurring fragments from which it is often impossible to obtain genetic material. Researchers are limited to [[Morphology (biology)|morphologic analysis]] but it is difficult to estimate the intra-species and inter-species variations and relationships that existed between specimens across time and place. Some observations are debated by researchers who do not always agree, and hypotheses that are supported by some authors are challenged by others.<ref name=sardella2014/>\n\nThere is general agreement on the most ancient record, which shows that [[Feliformia|feliform]]s and [[Caniformia|caniform]]s emerged within the super-family [[Carnivoramorpha]] 43 million [[years before present]] (YBP).<ref name=flynn2005/> The caniforms included the fox-like genus ''[[Leptocyon]]'' whose various species existed from 34 million YBP before branching 11.9 million YBP into ''[[Vulpes]]'' (foxes) and [[Canis|Canini]] (canines). The jackal-sized ''[[Eucyon]]'' existed in North America from 10 million YBP and by the [[Early Pliocene]] about 6\u20135 million YBP the coyote-like ''[[Eucyon#Eucyon davisi|Eucyon davisi]]''<ref name=fossilworks5/> invaded Eurasia. In North America it gave rise to early ''Canis'' which first appeared in the [[Miocene]] (6 million YBP) in south-western US and Mexico. By 5 million YBP the larger ''[[Canis lepophagus]]'' appeared in the same region.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p58}}\n\nThe canids that had immigrated from North America to Eurasia \u2013 ''[[Eucyon]]'', ''[[Vulpes]]'', and ''[[Nyctereutes]]'' \u2013 were small to medium-sized predators during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene but they were not the top predators. The position of the canids would change with the arrival of ''Canis'' to become a dominant predator across the [[Holarctic]]. The wolf-sized ''[[Evolution of the wolf#Canis chihliensis|C. chihliensis]]'' appeared in northern China in the Mid-Pliocene around 4\u20133 million YBP.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p148}} The large wolf-sized ''Canis'' appeared in the Middle [[Pliocene]] about 3 million years ago in the Yushe Basin, [[Shanxi]] Province, China. By 2.5 million years ago its range included the Nihewan Basin in [[Yangyuan County]], [[Hebei]], China and Kuruksay, Tadzhikistan.<ref name=vislobokova2003/> This was followed by an explosion of ''Canis'' evolution across Eurasia in the Early Pleistocene around 1.8 million YBP in what is commonly referred to as the ''wolf event''. It is associated with the formation of the [[mammoth steppe]] and continental glaciation.

Nowak compared the orbital angles of four North American [[Canis|canines]] (including the Indian dog) and produced the following values in degrees: coyote-42.8, wolf-42.8, dog-52.9 dire wolf-53.1. The orbital angle of the eye socket was clearly larger in the dog than in the coyote and the wolf; why it was almost the same as that of the dire wolf was not commented on.<ref name=nowak1979/>\n\nMany authors have concluded that compared to the adult extant wolf, the adult domestic dog has a relatively reduced rostrum (front part of the skull), an elevated [[frontal bone]], a wider [[palate]], a broader [[cranium]], and smaller teeth (Hildebrand1954; Clutton-Brock, Corbet & Hills 1976; Olsen 1985; Wayne 1986; Hemmer 1990; Morey 1990). Other authors have disagreed and have stated that these traits can overlap and vary within the two (Crockford 1999; Harrison 1973). Wolf cubs have similar relative skull proportions as adult dogs and this was proposed as evidence that the domestic dog is a [[Neoteny|neotenic wolf]]. This was proposed to be due to either  human selection for juvenile appearance or due to a [[Pleiotropy|pleiotropic]] effect as a result of selection for juvenile behavior (Clutton-Brock 1977; Belyaev 1979; Wayne 1986; Coppinger and Schneider 1995). Wayne (1986) concluded that his dog samples did not have significant relative shortening of the rostrum compared to wolves, calling this identification feature into question.<ref name=koler2002/> A 2004 study that used 310 wolf skulls and over 700 dog skulls representing 100 breeds concluded that the evolution of dog skulls can generally not be described by heterochronic processes such as neoteny although some pedomorphic dog breeds have skulls that resemble the skulls of juvenile wolves.<ref name=drake2004>Drake, Abby Grace, \"Evolution and development of the skull morphology of canids: An investigation of morphological integration and heterochrony\" (January 1, 2004).

However, Kieser and Groeneveld (1992) compared the mandibulo-dental measurements of jackals (''C. adustus, C. mesomelas'') and Cape foxes (''Vulpes chama'') to equivalent-sized dogs and found that the canines of these other canids tended to be slightly smaller and their second molars larger compared to dogs, otherwise the proportions were essentially the same in all species. They concluded that \"...the teeth of canids appear to have evolved in concert with one another and relatively independently of differences in dimorphism, size or functional demands\". This calls into question the assumption that dog teeth are relatively small due to recent selection, suggesting that dog dentition is plesiomorphic from an ancestor that was smaller than the wolf.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe reduced body size of the early dog compared to a wolf is thought due to niche selection (Olsen 1985; Morey 1992; Coppinger &\nCoppinger 2001). Morey (1992:199) states that \"Results...are consistent with a hypothesis that early domestic dogs are evolutionary paedomorphs, products of strong selection for ontogenetically channeled size reduction and alterations of reproductive timing associated with the new domestic way of life.\"<ref name=koler2002/> However, in an domestication experiment the domesticated foxes remained the same size as unselected foxes (Trutt 1999:167).<ref name=morey2015/>\n\nWayne (1986) concluded that the dog is closer in skull morphology to ''C. latrans, C. aureus, C. adustus, C. mesomelas, Cuon alpinus'' and ''Lycaon pictus'' than to the wolf. Dahr (1942) concluded that the shape of the dog brain case is closer to that of the coyote than to that of the wolf. Manwell and Baker (1983) reviewed Dahr's work with the addition of dental data for canids and concluded that the dog ancestor was probably within the range of 13.6\u201320.5&nbsp;kg, which is smaller than the range 27\u201354&nbsp;kg for extant wolves (Mech 1970) and is comparable with the [[Dingo]].<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe auditory [[Tympanic part of the temporal bone|bulla]] of the dog is relatively smaller and flatter than that of the wolf (Harrison 1973; Clutton-Brock, Corbet & Hill 1976; Nowak 1979; Olsen 1985; Wayne 1986), which is proposed to be due to relaxed selection under domestication as the dog no longer required the acute hearing of the wolf. However, bulla shape has been shown to facilitate increased sensitivity to specific frequencies but shape and size may not be correlated with acuity (Ewer 1973). Therefore, the observed difference could be that the dog bulla has retained its ancestral shape.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nThe ventral edge of the dog's horizontal [[ramus of the mandible]] has a convex curve that does not exist in the wolf (Olsen 1985; Clutton-Brock 1995), and no discussion of this difference could be found in the literature. However, Biknevicius and Van Valkenburgh (1997) noticed that the horizontal ramus of bone-processing predators is thicker dorso-ventrally at the point [[Anatomical terms of location#caudal|caudal]] to the site of bone processing. This thickening may have been a function for niche adaptation by the dog's ancestor.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nA description of the superficial brain morphology of jackals (''C. mesomelas, C. aureus''), coyotes (''C. latrans''), wolves (''C. lupus, C. rufus''), and dogs indicated that the [[cerebellum]] of the dog closely approximates that of the coyote, which is closely aligned with the jackals, and that the wolves show numerous brain traits distinct from the other species (Atkins and Dillon 1971). Wolves also have serological and biochemical traits distinct from dogs (Leone and Wiens 1956; Lauer, Kuyt & Baker 1969).<ref name=koler2002/>\n\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum, there was greater wolf [[genetic diversity]] than there is today,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=thalmann2013/> and within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.<ref name=perri2016/> One author has proposed that the most likely explanation for the different morphological characteristics of the dog compared to the wolf is that the dog's ancestor was adapted to a different niche than the wolf.<ref name=koler2002/>\n\n==Genetic record==\n\n===DNA sequences===\nThe [[mitochondria]] within each [[Cell (biology)|cell]] contain many copies of a small circular [[DNA genome]] and in mammals it is 16,000\u201318,000 [[base pairs]] in length. A cell contains hundreds or thousands of mitochondria and therefore the [[genes]] contained within those mitochondria are more abundant than the genes that occur in the nucleus of the cell.<ref name=rand2001/><ref name=wayne2006/> The abundance of [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mDNA) is useful for the genetic analysis of ancient remains where the DNA has degraded.<ref name=wayne2006/><ref name=hofreiter2001/>\n\nMitochondrial [[DNA sequences]] have a higher [[mutation rate]] than the mutation rate of nuclear genes and for mammals this rate is 5\u201310 times faster.<ref name=wayne2006/><ref name=li1997/><ref name=persole1999/> The mitochondrial protein-coding genes evolve much faster and are powerful markers for inferring evolution history at category levels such as families, genera, and species. However, they have evolved at a faster rate than other DNA markers and there is a timing difference in its molecular clock that needs to be validated against other sources. The taxonomic status of uncertain species is better resolved through using [[nuclear DNA]] from the nucleus of the cell, which is more suitable for analyzing the recent history.<ref name=wan2003/> In most cases, mDNA is inherited from the maternal ancestor.<ref name=wayne2006/><ref name=birky2001/> Therefore, [[phylogenetic analysis]] of mDNA sequences within species provides a history of maternal lineages that can be represented as a [[phylogenetic tree]].<ref name=wayne2006/><ref name=avice1994/><ref name=avice2000/>\n\n{{Gallery|title=From specimen to phylogenetic tree\n|width=130 | height=220|align=left\n|File:Razboinichya canid.tif\n|The 33,500 year old skull of the [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog \u2013 33,000 YBP|\"Altai dog\"]]\n|File:Eukaryote DNA-en.svg\n|Location of [[nuclear DNA]] within the [[chromosomes]] of a [[cell nucleus]]\n|File:DNA animation.gif\n|The structure of part of a DNA [[double helix]]\n|File:Radioactive Fluorescent Seq.jpg \n|The results of [[DNA sequencing]] listing the DNA molecule's [[nucleobases]] (coded as [[Guanine|G]], [[Cytosine|C]], [[Adenine|A]] or [[Thymine|T]]) \n|File:dna-SNP.svg\n|DNA molecule 1 differs from DNA molecule 2 at a single [[base pair]] location, called a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (a SNP [[mutation]])\n|File:Phylogenetic tree for wolves.jpg\n|[[Phylogenetic tree]] of wolves under study\n}}\n\n<div style=\"clear:left; margin-left: 5px; width: 900px; border: #C0C0C0 solid 4px; padding: 5px; overflow-x:auto;max-width:100%;box-sizing:border-box;\">\n{{Cladogram|align=right|title=Phylogenetic tree|caption=Phylogenetic relationship between four canids.<ref name=lindblad2005/><ref name=koepfli2015/>\n|cladogram={{clade | style = font-size: 85%;line-height:85%;width:325px;\n  |label1=common ancestor\n\n     |1={{clade\n        |1=[[Golden jackal]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate X).jpg|50 px]]\n        |2={{clade\n           |1=[[Coyote]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate IX).jpg|50 px]]\n           |2={{clade\n              |1=[[Gray wolf]] [[File:Dogs, jackals, wolves, and foxes (Plate I).jpg|50 px]]\n              |2=[[Dog]] [[File:Tibetan mastiff (white background).jpg|50 px]]\n              }}\n           }}\n        }}\n     }}\n  \n}}\nThe mutations that are different in these 4 [[Sequence alignment|sequences]] have been numbered and bolded.

The techniques used to [[DNA extraction|extract]], [[DNA sequencing|locate]] and [[DNA analysis|compare]] genetic sequences can be applied using advances in technology, which allows researchers to observe longer lengths of [[Base pair#Length measurements|base pairs]] that provide more data to give better [[phylogenetic]] resolution.<ref name=pang2009/> [[Phylogenetic trees]] compiled using different [[genetic markers]] have given conflicting results on the relationship between the wolf, dog and coyote. One study based on [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNPs]]<ref name=cronin2014/> (a single [[mutation]]), and another based on [[nuclear gene]] sequences<ref name=bardeleben2005/> (taken from the [[cell nucleus]]), showed dogs clustering with coyotes and separate from wolves.

The time between generations for wolves is assumed to be three years based on the extant gray wolf, and two years for the dog based on the extant dog.<ref name=lindblad2005/> One recent major study assumed a generation time of 2 years for the dog for as far back as 10,000 years ago, and then assumed a generation time of 3 years (the same as the wolf) before that to calculate a proposed divergence time between the two.<ref name=freedman2014/> In 2017, the wolf research scientist [[L. David Mech]] queried why evolutionary biologists were calculating the approximate time of the dog diverging from the wolf through using a wolf generation time of three years when published works using large data sets demonstrate a figure of 4.2\u20134.7 years. They were encouraged to recalculate their divergence dates accordingly.<ref name=mech2017/>\n\nDNA studies are conducted but with \"the mutation rate as the dominant source of uncertainty.\"<ref name=freedman2014/> In 2005, Lindblad-Toh sequenced the first draft genome of the extant dog, and calculated a proposed mutation rate of 1x10<sup>\u22128</sup> mutations per generation.<ref name=lindblad2005/> In 2015, Skoglund was able to sequence the first draft genome of the 35,000 YBP [[Evolution of the wolf#Taimyr wolf|Taimyr wolf]] and used its radio-carbon date to validate a proposed genetic mutation rate of 0.4x10<sup>\u22128</sup> mutations per generation.<ref name=skoglund2015/> The difference is a timing factor of 2.5, however another study stated that because only one Pleistocene wolf specimen has so far been sequenced, then the result should be treated with caution, with that study then providing both estimates to calculate the proposed divergence times between the wolf and dog.<ref name=fan2016/> However, in 2016 the mutation rate of the 4,800 YBP [[Origin of the domestic dog#Newgrange dog \u2013 two domestication events|Newgrange dog]] matched that of the Taimyr wolf.<ref name=frantz2016/>\n\n===Wolf-like canids===\n{{Further|Canidae#Phylogenetic relationships}}\n\nThe wolf-like canids (the canid subfamily [[Caninae]]) are a group of large carnivores that are genetically closely related because their [[chromosome]]s number 78. The group includes genus ''Canis'', ''Cuon'' and ''Lycaon''. The members are the [[dog]] ''(C. lupus familiaris)'', [[gray wolf]] (''C. lupus''),  [[coyote]] (''C. latrans''), [[golden jackal]] (''C. aureus''), [[Ethiopian wolf]] (''C. simensis''), [[black-backed jackal]] (''C. mesomelas''), [[side-striped jackal]] (''C. adustus''), [[dhole]] (''Cuon alpinus''), and [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'').<ref name=wayne1993/><ref name=wayne1989/><ref name=vila2012/> Newly proposed members include the [[red wolf]] (''Canis rufus''), [[eastern wolf]] (''Canis lycaon''), and [[African golden wolf]] (''C. anthus''). As they possess 78 chromosomes, all members of the genus ''Canis'' (coyotes, wolves, jackals) are [[Karyology|karyologically]] indistinguishable from each other, and from the dhole and the African hunting dog.<ref name=wayne2006/>{{rp|p279}}<ref name=wurster1982/> The members of ''Canis'' can potentially [[hybrid (biology)|interbreed]]<ref name=wayne1999/> and there is evidence that the Ethiopian wolf has hybridized with dogs.<ref name=gottelli1994/> According to zoologist [[Reginald Innes Pocock|Reginald Pocock]], a dhole interbred with a golden jackal.<ref name=pocock1941/> The African hunting dog is large, highly mobile, known to disperse over large distances and are rare throughout much of their geographical range,<ref name=girman2001/> making opportunities for hybridization difficult. A study of the maternal [[mitochondrial DNA]] of the black-backed jackal could find no evidence of [[genotypes]] from the most likely mates \u2013 the side-striped jackal nor the golden jackal \u2013 indicating that male black-backed jackals had not bred with these.<ref name=wayne1990/> A search of the scientific literature could not find evidence of hybridization for the rare side-striped jackal.\n\nA DNA sequence alignment for the wolf-like canids gave a phylogenetic tree with the gray wolf and dog being the most closely related, followed by a close affiliation with the coyote, golden jackal and Ethiopian wolf, and the dog can hybridize in the wild with these three species. Next closest to this group are the dhole and African wild dog that both have unique meat-slicing teeth, suggesting that this adaptation was later lost by the other members.<ref name=lindblad2005/> The two African jackals are shown as the most [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] members of this clade, which means that this tree is indicating an African origin for the clade.<ref name=lindblad2005/><ref name=kaminski2014/> The tree illustrates the [[genotype-phenotype distinction]], where a [[genotype]] is an organism's full [[hereditary]] information and a [[phenotype]] is an organism's actual observed properties, such as [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[Developmental biology|development]], or [[behavior]]. By phenotype, the dhole (genus ''Cuon'') and the African hunting dog (genus ''Lycaon'') are not  classified as members of the genus ''Canis'', but by genotype they are closer to dogs, wolves and coyotes than are the two genus ''Canis'' jackals \u2013 the Side-striped jackal (''C. adustus'') and the Black-backed jackal (''C. mesomelas'').\n\nIn 2015, a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and nuclear genome sequences of African and Eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf-like canids had colonized Africa from Eurasia at least 5 times throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of the African canid diversity resulted from the immigration of Eurasian ancestors, likely coincident with Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions.<ref name=koepfli2015/>\n\n\n'''[[Phylogenetic tree]] of the extant wolf-like canids,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=mtdna_seq_desc|[[Phylogenetic tree|Phylogenetic relationships]] and time of [[genetic divergence]] for the extant [[Evolution of the wolf#Wolf-like canids|wolf-like canids]] based on DNA of the entire [[cell nucleus]].<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/> Exception 1: Side-striped jackal and Black-backed jackal added based on segments of DNA taken from the [[cell nucleus]]<ref name=lindblad2005/><ref name=koepfli2015/> with proposed divergence times in millions of years.<ref name=koepfli2015/> Exception 2: The position of the Himalayan wolf is based on segments of [[mitochondrial DNA]]<ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=ersmark2016/><ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> and segments from the cell nucleus.<ref name=koepfli2015/><ref name=werhahn2017/><ref name=werhahn2018/> Exception 3: The position of the Indian plains wolf is based on mDNA.<ref name=aggarwal2007/><ref name=sharma2004/><ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=rueness2011/><ref name=miklosi2015/> and its timing 120,000 years ago.<ref name=Loog2018/> Exception 4: [[Late Pleistocene]] wolf included for time-line purposes only - the [[most recent common ancestor]] for all other ''Canis lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct but excluding the Indian plains wolf and the Himalayan wolf \u2013 was 80,000 years before present.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> Exception 5: Gray wolf and dog timing 25,000 years ago.<ref name=Loog2018/><ref name=Werhahn2018/><ref name=Schweizer2020/>}} with the pink shading representing the species ''Canis lupus''.'''\n\n{{cladeN    |style=background-color:#ccccff;font-size:85%;\n            |length=50px    |sublabelstyle1=border-left:1px solid black;

There is evidence of gene flow between [[African golden wolves]], [[golden jackals]], and gray wolves. The study suggests that the African golden wolf is a descendant of a genetically [[genetic admixture|admixed]] canid of 72% grey [[wolf]] and 28% [[Ethiopian wolf]] ancestry, and that the Ethiopian wolf once had a wider range in Africa. One African golden wolf from the Egyptian [[Sinai Peninsula]] showed high admixture with the Middle Eastern gray wolves and dogs, highlighting the role of the land bridge between the African and Eurasian continents in canid evolution. There is evidence of gene flow between golden jackals and Middle Eastern wolves, less so with European and Asian wolves, and least with North American wolves. The study proposes that the golden jackal ancestry found in North American wolves may have occurred before the divergence of the Eurasian and North American gray wolves. The study indicates that the common ancestor of the [[coyote]] and gray wolf has genetically [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] with a [[ghost population]] of an extinct unidentified canid.  The canid is genetically close to the [[dhole]] and has evolved after the divergence of the African hunting dog from the other canid species. The [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] position of the coyote compared to the wolf is proposed to be due to the coyote retaining more of the mitochondrial genome of this unknown canid.<ref name=gopalakrishnan2018/>\n\nA genomic study on the wolves of China included museum specimens of wolves from southern China that were collected between 1963-1988. The wolves in the study formed 3 clades: [[Himalayan wolf]], north Asian wolves that matched those from Russia, and a unique population from southern China. One specimen from [[Jiangxi]] province in eastern China shared gene flow with the the wolves from southern China, however its genome was 12-14 percent admixed with a canid that may be the dhole or an unknown canid that predates the genetic divergence of the dhole. The wolf population from southern China is believed to be still existing in that region.<ref name=Wang2019/>\n\n===Two wolf haplogroups===\n{{See also|Beringian wolf|Megafaunal wolf}}\n\nA [[haplotype]] ([[haploid]] [[genotype]]) is a group of [[genes]] in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent.<ref name=cox2016/><ref name=editorial2012/> A [[haplogroup]] is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (a [[mutation]]).<ref name=arora2015/><ref name=ISGS2015/> Mitochondrial DNA passes along a maternal lineage that can date back thousands of years.<ref name=arora2015/>\n\nIn 2010, a study compared [[DNA sequences]] that were 230 [[base pairs]] in length from the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] of 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000\u20131,200 YBP with those of modern gray wolves. Most of the sequences could be represented on a [[phylogenetic tree]]. However, the haplotypes of the [[Himalayan wolf]] and the [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]] could not because they were 8 mutations apart from the other wolves,<ref name=pilot2010/> indicating distinct lineages which had previously been found in other studies.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=aggarwal2007/><ref name=sharma2004/> The study found that there were 75 different gray wolf [[mitochondrial DNA|mDNA]] haplotypes that include 23 in Europe, 30 in Asia, 18 in North America, 3 in both Europe and Asia, and 1 in both Europe and North America.<ref name=pilot2010/> These haplotypes could be allocated into two haplogroups<ref name=miklosi2015/><ref name=pilot2010/> that were separated from each other by 5 [[mutations]]. Haplogroup 1 formed a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]] (indicating that they all carried the same mutation inherited from a single female ancestor). All other haplotypes were basal in the tree, and these formed 2\u20133 smaller clades that were assigned to haplogroup 2 that was not monophyletic.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/>\n\nHaplogroups 1 and 2 could be found spread across Eurasia but only haplogroup 1 could be found in North America. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup 2 indicating a haplogroup 2 predominance in this region for over 40,000 years before and after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicated that in Europe haplogroup 2 became outnumbered by haplogroup 1 over the past several thousand years<ref name=miklosi2015/> but in North America haplogroup 2 became extinct and was replaced by haplogroup 1 after the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/> Access into North America was available between 20,000\u201311,000 years ago after the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] had retreated but before the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] became inundated by the sea.<ref name=tamm2007/> Therefore, haplogroup 1 was able to enter into North America during this period.\n\nStable [[isotope analysis]] conducted on the bone of a specimen allows researchers to form conclusions about the diet, and therefore the ecology, of extinct wolf populations. This analysis suggests that the Pleistocene wolves from haplogroup 2 found in [[Beringia]] and Belgium preyed mainly on Pleistocene megafauna,<ref name=germonpre2009/><ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=leonard2007/> which became rare at the beginning of the Holocene 12,000 years ago.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2010/> One study found the Beringian wolf to be [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to all other gray wolves except for the extant [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]] and the extant [[Himalayan wolf]].<ref name=leonard2007/> The Pleistocene Eurasian wolves have been found to be morphologically and genetically comparable to the Pleistocene eastern-[[Beringian wolf|Beringian wolves]],<ref name=germonpre2013/> with some of the ancient European and Beringian wolves sharing a common haplotype (a17),<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=leonard2007/> which makes ecological similarity likely.<ref name=pilot2010/> Two ancient wolves from the Ukraine dated around 30,000 YBP and the 33,000 YBP [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog \u2013 33,000 YBP|\"Altai dog\"]] had the same sequence as six Beringian wolves, and another from the Czech Republic dated 44,000 YBP had the same sequence as two Beringian wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/>\n\nIt has been proposed that the Pleistocene wolves across northern Eurasia and northern North America represented a continuous and almost [[Panmixia|panmictic]] population that was genetically and probably also ecologically distinct from the wolves living in this area today.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2007/> The specialized Pleistocene wolves did not contribute to the genetic diversity of modern wolves, and the modern wolf populations across the Holarctic are likely to be the descendants of wolves from populations that came from more southern refuges.<ref name=hofreiter2007/> Extant haplogroup 2 wolves can be found in Italy, the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains but rare elsewhere in Europe. In Asia, only four haplotypes have been identified as belonging to this haplogroup, and two of them occur in the Middle East.<ref name=pilot2014/> Haplogroup 2 did not become extinct in Europe, and if before the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] haplogroup 2 was exclusively associated with the wolf ecomorph specialized in preying on megafauna, it would mean that in Europe it was capable of adapting to changing prey.<ref name=pilot2010/>\n\nIn 2013, a mitochondrial DNA sequencing of ancient wolf-like canids revealed another separate lineage of 3 haplotypes (forming a haplogroup) that was found in 3 Late Pleistocene specimens from Belgium; however, it has not been detected in extant wolves.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=pilot2014/> One of these was the [[Paleolithic dog#Goyet dog \u2013 36,000 YBP|\"Goyet dog\"]].<ref name=thalmann2013/>\n\n====Dissenting view====\n[[File:Phylogenetic tree for wolves.jpg|thumb|mDNA [[phylogenetic tree]] for wolves.

[[Beringian wolf]] (Alaska 28,000 YBP) haplotype found in the modern clade XVI from China.]]\nIn 2016, a study was undertaken due to concerns that previous mDNA studies may have been conducted with insufficient genetic resolution or limited geographical coverage and had not included sufficient specimens from Russia, China, and the Middle East. The study compared a 582 [[base pair]] [[DNA sequences|sequence]] of the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] which gave twice the phylogenetic resolution of the 2010 study.<ref name=pilot2010/> The study compared the sequences of both modern wolves and ancient wolf specimens, including specimens from the remote areas of North America, Russia and China. The study included the [[#Taimyr wolf|Taimyr wolves]], the [[Paleolithic dog#Goyet dog \u2013 36,000 YBP|Goyet \"dog\"]], the [[Paleolithic dog#Altai dog \u2013 33,000 YBP|Altai \"dog\"]], Beringian wolves, and other ancient specimens.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\nThe study found 114 different wolf haplotypes among 314 sequences, with the new haplotypes being found in Siberia and China. The phylogenetic tree resolved into 19 clades that included both modern and ancient wolves, which showed that the most basal clades included the [[Indian wolf#Canis Indica|Indian gray wolf]] and the [[Himalayan wolf]], with a subclade of wolves from China and Mongolia falling within the Himalayan wolf clade. The two most basal North American haplotypes included the [[Mexican wolf]] and the [[Vancouver Island wolf]], however the Vancouver Island wolf showed the same haplotype as a dog which indicates admixture,<ref name=ersmark2016/> with the dog lineage basal to all extant North American subspecies.<ref name=fan2016/> In Europe, the two most genetically distinct haplotypes form the [[Iberian wolf]] and separately the [[Italian wolf]] that was positioned close to the ancient wolves. The [[Greenland wolf|Greenland wolves]] all belonged to one haplotype that had been previously found among North American wolves and which indicates their origin from North America. The Eastern wolf was confirmed as a coyote/wolf hybrid. Wolves found in the regions of the [[Chukotka Peninsula]], the North Korean border, [[Amur Oblast]] and [[Khakassia]] showed the greatest genetic diversity and with close links to all other wolves found across the holarctic. One ancient haplotype that had been found in Alaska (Eastern Beringia 28,000 YBP) and Russia (Medvezya \"Bear\" Cave, [[Pechora]] area, Northern [[Urals]] 18,000 YBP) was shared with some modern wolves found in China and Mongolia.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\nThe previous finding of two wolf haplogroups<ref name=pilot2010/> was not clearly delineated in this study but it agreed that the genetic diversity of past wolves has been lost at the beginning of the Holocene in Alaska, Siberia, and Europe with limited overlap with modern wolves. For the ancient wolves of North America, instead of an extinction/replacement model suggested by a previous study,<ref name=leonard2007/> this study found substantial evidence of a population bottleneck in North America in which the ancient wolf diversity was almost lost around the beginning of the Holocene (no further elaboration in the study). In Eurasia, the loss of ancient lineages could not be simply explained and appears to have been slow across time with the reasons unclear.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\n===Into America and Japan===\n{{See also|Japanese wolf|Ezo Wolf}}\n[[File:Beringia land bridge-noaagov.gif|right|320px|Shrinking of the Bering land bridge]]\n[[File:Japan glaciation.gif|thumb|right|Japanese archipelago 20,000 years ago with Hokkaido island bridged to the mainland, thin black line indicates present-day shoreline]]\n\nIn 2016, a study built on the work of another major study<ref name=thalmann2013/> and analyzed the sequences of 12 genes that are located on the [[heavy strand]] of the mitochondrial genome of extinct and modern ''C. lupus''. The study excluded the sequences of the divergent [[Himalayan wolf]] and the [[Indian wolf#Canis indica|Indian gray wolf]]. The ancient specimens were [[radiocarbon dated]] and [[Stratigraphy|stratagraphically]] dated, and together with the sequences generated a time-based phylogenetic tree. From the tree, the study was able to infer the most recent common ancestor for all other ''C. lupus'' specimens \u2013 modern and extinct \u2013 was 80,000 YBP and this date concurred with the earlier study.<ref name=thalmann2013/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> The study could find no evidence of a population bottleneck for wolves until a few thousand years ago.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nThe phylogenetic tree showed the [[polyphyly]] of American wolves, the Mexican wolf was divergent from other North American wolves, and these other North American wolves formed two closely related clades. A scenario consistent with the phylogenetic, ice sheet and sea-level data was that during the Ice Age when sea levels were at their lowest, there was a single wave of wolf colonization into North America starting with the opening of the [[Bering land bridge]] 70,000 YBP and closing during the [[Late Glacial Maximum]] of the Yukon corridor that ran through the division between the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] and the [[Cordilleran Ice Sheet]] 23,000 YBP. Mexican wolves were part of the single wave and either diverged from the other wolves before entering North America or once in North America due to the change in its environment.\n\nAs wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but modern wolves could trace their ancestry back  only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through admixture.<ref name=koblmuller2016/> The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one supported the findings of earlier studies.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=randi2011/><ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> There possibly existed a panmictic wolf population with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America until the closing of the ice sheets.<ref name=pilot2010/><ref name=hofreiter2007/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> Once the sheets closed, the southern wolves were isolated and north of the sheets only the [[Beringian wolf]] existed. The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000 YBP, the sheets receded 12,000\u20136,000 YBP, the Beringian wolf went extinct and the southern wolves expanded to recolonize the rest of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the ice sheets. However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nStudies using [[mitochondrial DNA]] have indicated that the wolves of coastal south-east Alaska are genetically distinct from inland gray wolves, reflecting a pattern also observed in other taxa. They show a phylogenetic relationship with extirpated wolves from the south (Oklahoma), indicating that these wolves are the last remains of a once widespread group that has been largely extirpated during the last century, and that the wolves of northern North America had originally expanded from southern refuges below the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] after the ice had melted at the end of the [[Last Glacial Maximum]].<ref name=weckworth2005/><ref name=weckworth2010/><ref name=weckworth2011/> A [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome]] DNA study indicated that all North American wolves were [[monophyletic]] and therefore are the descendants of a common ancestor.<ref name=vonholdt2016/>\n\nDuring the same period, the [[Soya Strait]] between [[Hokkaido]] and [[Sakhalin Island]] was dry for 75,000 years and it was proposed that the extinct [[Ezo Wolf|Ezo wolf]] (''C. l. hattai'') arrived on Hokkaido from Sakhalin.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/><ref name=abe1999/> However, the sequences indicated that it arrived in Hokkaido less than 10,000 YBP. The Ezo wolf was closely related to one of the North American clades,<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/><ref name=ishiguro2010/> but different to the more southerly [[Japanese wolf]] (''C. l. hodophilax'') that was basal to modern wolves.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=koblmuller2016/> The Japanese wolf inhabited Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu islands<ref name=walker2008/><ref name=ishiguro2009/> but not Hokkaido Island.<ref name=ishiguro2009/> This indicates that its ancestor may have migrated from the Asian continent through the Korean Peninsula into Japan.<ref name=matsumura2014/><ref name=ishiguro2009/> The past sea levels of the [[Korean Strait]] together with the timing of the Japanese wolf sequences indicated that it arrived to the southern islands less than 20,000 YBP.<ref name=koblmuller2016/>\n\nThe dog was a very successful invader of North America and had established a widespread [[ecological niche]] by the Early\u2013Middle Holocene. There was no overlap in niche between the dog and the wolf in comparison to the dog and other North American canids. By the Late Holocene, the dog's niche area was less in size than researchers had expected to find, indicating that it was limited by [[Biotic component|biotic factors]]. These regions include the northeast and northwest of the United States that correlate with the greatest densities of early human occupation, indicating that the dog had \"defected\" from the wolf niche to the human niche and explains why the dog's niche area was not as large as expected. The separation between dog and wolf may reflect the rapid rate in which domestication occurred,<ref name=pardi2016/> including the possibility of a second domestication event occurring in North America.<ref name=witt2015/><ref name=pardi2016/> Packs of wolves and hunter-gatherers hunt similar prey in a similar way within a similar group social structure that may have facilitated wolf domestication.<ref name=hall1978/><ref name=olsen1985/>\n\nThe wolf was exterminated in the southern part of their historic geographical range in North America by the middle of the 20th century. An mDNA study of 34 wolf remains from North America dated between 1856 and 1915 found their genetic diversity to be twice that of modern wolves in these regions, and two thirds of the haplotypes identified were unique. These results indicate that a historic population of several hundred thousand wolves once existed in Mexico and the western US.<ref name=leonard2004/><ref name=miklosi2015/>\n\n===Beringia===\nGrey wolves suffered a species-wide [[population bottleneck]] (reduction) approximately 25,000 YBP during the Last Glacial Maximum. This was followed by a single population of modern wolves expanding out of a [[Beringia#Beringian refugium|Beringia refuge]] to repopulate the wolf's former range, replacing the remaining Late Pleistocene wolf populations across Eurasia and North America as they did so.<ref name=Loog2018/><ref name=Werhahn2018/><ref name=Schweizer2020/> This source population probably did not give rise to dogs, but admixed with dogs which allowed them to gain coat colour genes that are also related to immunity, and provided dogs with genes which allowed them to adapt to high-altitude environments (e.g. Tibet). This suggests that the genetic divergence of European and East Asian dogs could be based on admixture with different sub-populations of wolves.<ref name=Schweizer2020/>\n\nThere is little genetic information available on the ancient wolves that existed prior to the bottleneck. However, studies show that one or more of these ancient populations is more directly ancestral to dogs than are modern wolves, and conceivably these were more prone to domestication by the first humans to invade Eurasia.<ref name=Schweizer2020/>\n\n===Divergence with the coyote===\nIn 1993, a study proposed that the wolves of North America display skull traits more similar towards the coyote than those wolves from  Eurasia.<ref name=goulet1993/> In 2016, a [[Whole genome sequencing|whole-genome]] DNA study proposed, based on the assumptions made, that all of the North American wolves and coyotes diverged from a common ancestor less than 6,000\u2013117,000 years ago. The study also indicated that all North America wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the [[red wolf]] and [[eastern wolf]] are highly [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. One test indicated a wolf/coyote divergence time of 51,000 years before present that matched other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time. Another test indicated that the red wolf diverged from the coyote between 55,000\u2013117,000 years before present and the Great Lakes region wolf 32,000 years before present.

The sample provided the first draft [[genome]] of the [[cell nucleus]] for a Pleistocene [[carnivore]], and the sequence was identified as belonging to ''Canis lupus''.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nUsing the Taimyr-1 specimen's radiocarbon date, its genome sequence and that of a modern wolf, a direct estimate of the genome-wide mutation rate in dogs / wolves could be made to calculate the time of divergence. The data indicated that the previously unknown Taimyr-1 lineage was a wolf population separate to modern wolves and dogs and indicated that the Taimyr-1 genotype, gray wolves and dogs diverged from a now-extinct common ancestor<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=gross2015/> before the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum, 27,000\u201340,000&nbsp;years ago. The separation of the dog and wolf did not have to coincide with selective breeding by humans.<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=nature2015/> Such an early divergence is consistent with several paleontological reports of dog-like canids dated up to 36,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]], as well as evidence that domesticated dogs most likely accompanied early colonizers into the Americas.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nComparison to the gray wolf lineage indicated that Taimyr-1 was basal to gray wolves from the Middle East, China, Europe and North America but shared a substantial amount of history with the present-day gray wolves after their divergence from the coyote. This implies that the ancestry of the majority of gray wolf populations today stems from an ancestral population that lived less than 35,000&nbsp;years ago but before the inundation of the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] with the subsequent isolation of Eurasian and North American wolves.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nA comparison of the ancestry of the Taimyr-1 lineage to the dog lineage indicated that some modern dog breeds have a closer association with either the gray wolf or Taimyr-1 due to [[Genetic admixture|admixture]]. The [[Saarloos wolfdog]] showed more association with the gray wolf, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with gray wolves in this breed. Taimyr-1 shared more alleles (gene expressions) with those breeds that are associated with high latitudes: the [[Siberian husky]] and [[Greenland dog]]<ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=gross2015/> that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the [[Shar Pei]] and [[Finnish spitz]]. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, although an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taimyr-1 population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. These results can be explained either by a very early presence of dogs in northern Eurasia or by the genetic legacy of Taimyr-1 being preserved in northern wolf populations until the arrival of dogs at high latitudes. This [[introgression]] could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates that the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nAn attempt to explore admixture between Taimyr-1 and gray wolves produced unreliable results.<ref name=skoglund2015/>\n\nAs the Taimyr wolf had contributed to the genetic makeup of the Arctic breeds, a later study suggested that descendants of the Taimyr wolf survived until dogs were domesticated in Europe and arrived at high latitudes where they mixed with local wolves, and these both contributed to the modern Arctic breeds. Based on the most widely accepted oldest zooarchaeological dog remains, domestic dogs most likely arrived at high latitudes within the last 15,000&nbsp;years. The mutation rates calibrated from both the Taimyr wolf and the [[Origin of the domestic dog#Two domestication events|Newgrange dog]] genomes suggest that modern wolf and dog populations diverged from a common ancestor between 20,000\u201360,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]]. This indicates that either dogs were domesticated much earlier than their first appearance in the archaeological record, or they arrived in the Arctic early, or both.<ref name=machugh2016/>\n\nThe finding of a second wolf specimen from the same area (\u201c''Taimry-2''\u201d) and dated to 42,000&nbsp;[[Before Present|YBP]] has also been sequenced but yielded only mitochondrial DNA.<ref name=ersmark2016b/>\n\n===''Canis variabilis''===\nIn 2015, a study looked at the [[mtDNA control region|mitochondrial control region]] sequences of 13 ancient canid remains and one modern wolf from five sites across Arctic north-east Siberia. The fourteen canids revealed nine mitochondrial [[haplotype]]s, three of which were on record and the others not reported before. The phylogentic tree generated from the sequences showed that four of the Siberian canids dated 28,000 YBP and one [[Canis lupus variabilis|''Canis c.f. variabilis'']] dated 360,000 YBP were highly divergent. The haplotype designated as S805 (28,000 YBP) from the [[Yana River]] was one mutation away from another haplotype S902 (8,000 YBP) that represents Clade A of the modern wolf and domestic dog lineages. Closely related to this haplotype was one that was found in the recently-extinct [[Japanese wolf]]. Several ancient haplotypes were oriented around S805, including ''Canis c.f. variabilis'' (360,000 YBP), Belgium (36,000 YBP \u2013 the \"Goyet dog\"), Belgium (30,000 YBP), and Konsteki, Russia (22,000 YBP). Given the position of the S805 haplotype on the phylogenetic tree, it may potentially represent a direct link from the [[progenitor]] (including ''Canis c.f. variabilis'') to the domestic dog and modern wolf lineages. The gray wolf is thought to be ancestral to the domestic dog, however its relationship to ''C. variabilis'', and the genetic contribution of ''C. variabilis'' to the dog, is the subject of debate.<ref name=lee2015/>\n\nThe [[Zhokhov Island]] (8,700 YBP) and Aachim (1,700 YBP) canid haplotypes fell within the domestic dog clade, cluster with S805, and also share their haplotypes with \u2013 or are one mutation away from \u2013 the [[Tibetan wolf]] (''C. l. filchneri'') and the recently-extinct Japanese wolf (''C. l. hodophilax''). This may indicate that these canids retained the genetic signature of admixture with regional wolf populations. Another haplotype designated as S504 (47,000 YBP) from [[Silene stenophylla#Duvanny Yar|Duvanny Yar]] appeared on the phylogenetic tree as not being connected to wolves (both ancient and modern) yet ancestral to dogs, and may represent a genetic source for regional dogs.<ref name=lee2015/>\n\nThe authors concluded that the structure of the modern dog [[gene pool]] was contributed to from ancient Siberian wolves and possibly from ''Canis c.f. variabilis''.<ref name=lee2015/><ref name=Irizarry2018/>\n\n==Rise to dominant predator==\nIn 2015, a study looked at the paleoecology of large carnivores across the [[Mammoth steppe]] during the [[Late Pleistocene]] by using stable isotope analysis of their fossil [[collagen]] to reconstruct their diets. Based on testing in Belgium, around 40,000 YBP the [[Cave hyena]]s preyed on mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horses and reindeer, with [[Panthera leo spelaea|cave lion]]s taking reindeer and young [[cave bear]]s. Wolves appear to have been out-competed by [[cave hyena]]s and had their diet restricted to chamois, giant deer and red deer. However, after the Last Glacial Maximum around 14,000 YBP, wolves had access to all prey species, the cave lion was restricted to reindeer, and the cave hyena had gone extinct.<ref name=bocherens2011/><ref name=yeakel2013/><ref name=bocherens2015/> The data suggests that the extinction of the cave hyena allowed the wolf to become the dominant predator rather than the cave lion, just before the cave lion's extinction.<ref name=bocherens2015/> Another study indicated that the wolf thrived compared to the cave hyena when there was greater snow cover.<ref name=dinnis2016/>\n\n==Wolf population differences==\n{{See also|Beringian wolf|Cave wolf|Megafaunal wolf|Paleolithic dog}}\n\nThe grey wolf ''Canis lupus'' is a highly adaptable species that is able to exist in a range of environments and which possesses a wide distribution across the [[Holarctic]]. Studies of modern grey wolves have identified distinct sub-populations that live in close proximity to each other.<ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=schweizer2016a/> This variation in sub-populations is closely linked to differences in habitat \u2013 precipitation, temperature, vegetation, and prey specialization \u2013 which affect cranio-dental plasticity.<ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=leonard2014/> The archaeological and paleontological records show their continuous presence for at least the last 300,000 years.<ref name=sotnikova2010/> This continuous wolf presence contrasts with [[Genome|genomic]] studies, which suggest that all modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=skoglund2015/><ref name=fan2016/> that existed as recently as 20,000 years ago.<ref name=freedman2014/> These studies indicate that a [[population bottleneck]] was followed by a rapid radiation from an ancestral population at a time during, or just after, the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. This implies that the original wolf populations were out-competed by a new type of wolf which replaced them.<ref name=koblmuller2016/> However, the geographic origin of this radiation is not known.\n\nApart from domestication, humans have harmed the wolf by restricting its habitat through persecution. This has caused a dramatic decrease in its population size over the last two centuries.<ref name=boitani2003/><ref name=leonard2005/> The shrinking of its habitats that overlap with those of close-relatives such as dogs and coyotes have led to numerous occurrences of hybridization.<ref name=vonholdt2011/><ref name=vonholdt2013/> These events, in addition to recent turnovers (extinctions and repopulations by other geneotypes), has made the unravelling of the [[Phylogeography|phylogeographic]] history of the wolf difficult.<ref name=ersmark2016/>\n\n===Ecotypes===\n\nAn [[ecotype]] is a variant in which the [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences are too few or too subtle to warrant being classified as a subspecies. These can occur in the same geographic region where distinct habitats such as meadow, forest, swamp, and sand dunes provide ecological niches. Where similar ecological conditions occur in widely separated places it is possible for a similar ecotype to occur. This is different to a subspecies, which may exist across a number of different habitats. In animals, ecotypes can be regarded as micro-subspecies that owe their differing characteristics to the effects of a very local environment.<ref name=mayr1999/> Ecotypes have no [[taxonomic rank]].\n\nGray wolves have a wide, natural distribution across the [[Holarctic]] that includes many different habitats, which can vary from the high arctic to dense forests, open steppe and deserts. The genetic differences between different populations of gray wolves is tightly linked to the type of habitat in which they live.<ref name=leonard2014/> Differences in genetic markers among the Scandinavian wolf population has arisen in only just over a decade due to their small population size,<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=vila2003/> which indicates that these differences are not dependent on a long time spent in isolation and that larger population patterns can evolve in just a few thousand years.<ref name=leonard2014/> These differences can also include fur color and density, and body size.<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=munoz2009/><ref name=musiani2007/> The differences can also include behavior, as coastal wolves eat fish<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=munoz2009/> and tundra wolves migrate.<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=musiani2007/> These differences have been observed between two wolf populations that are living in close proximity. It has been shown that mountain wolves do not interbreed with nearby coastal wolves, and the Alps of France and Switzerland have been repopulated with wolves from the mountains of nearby Italy<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=valiere2003/> and from the far away mountains of Croatia<ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=fabbri2014/> rather than from the nearer lowlands, which indicates that distance is not the driving force in differences between the two [[Ecomorphology|ecomorphs]].<ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nIn 2013, a genetic study found that the wolf population in Europe was divided along a north\u2013south axis and formed five major clusters. Three clusters were identified occupying southern and central Europe in Italy, the Carpathians, and the Dinaric-Balkans. Another two clusters were identified occupying north-central Europe and the Ukrainian steppe. The Italian wolf consisted of an isolated population with low genetic diversity. Wolves from Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece formed the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. Wolves from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia formed the north-central Europe cluster with wolves from the Carpathians cluster a mixture of wolves from the north-central cluster and the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. The wolves from the Carpathians were more similar to the wolves from the Ukrainian Steppe than they were to wolves from north-central Europe. These clusters may have been the result of expansion from glacial refugia, an adaptation to local environments, and landscape fragmentation and the killing of wolves in some areas by humans.<ref name=stronen2013/>\n\nIn 2016, two studies compared the sequences of 42,000 [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] in North American gray wolves and found that they formed six ecotypes. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables on sequence variation.<ref name=schweizer2016a/><ref name=schweizer2016b/> These findings were in accord with previous findings that precipitation influenced morphology,<ref name=okeefe2013/> and that vegetation<ref name=geffen2004/> and habitat type<ref name=munoz2009/><ref name=carmichael2007/> influenced wolf differences. One of these studies found that the variation in 11 key genes affected wolf vision, sense of smell, hearing, coat color, metabolism, and immunity. The study identified 1,040 genes that are potentially under selection due to habitat variation, and therefore that there was evidence of local adaption of the wolf ecotypes at a molecular level. Most notable was the positive selection of genes that influence vision, coat color, metabolism and immunity in the Artic and High Arctic ecotypes, and that the British Columbia ecotype also has a unique set of adaptions.<ref name=schweizer2016b/> The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf's preference to remain in the type of habitat that it was born into.<ref name=schweizer2016a/>\n\nEcological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence gray wolf [[population genetics|genetic population structure]] and cranio-dental [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]].<ref name=hofreiter2010/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=musiani2007/><ref name=carmichael2001/><ref name=carmichael2006/><ref name=geffen2004/><ref name=pilot2006/><ref name=flower2014/> During the Last Glacial Maximum, there was greater wolf [[genetic diversity]] than there is today,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=thalmann2013/> and within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.<ref name=perri2016/>\n\n===Pleistocene wolves===\nThe oldest ''Canis'' remains found in Europe were from France and dated to 3.1 million YBP,<ref name=lacombat2008/> followed by ''Canis cf. etruscus'' (where [[Open nomenclature#Usage of open nomenclature|cf.]] in Latin means confer, uncertain) from Italy dated to 2.2 million YBP.<ref name=rook1996/> ''C. lupus'' first appeared in Italy during [[Marine Isotope Stage]] 9<ref name=gliozzi1997/> (337,000 YBP).

These wolves were out-competed by the larger competitors, leading to a more omnivorous diet with increased crushing ability in an open environment that supported more types of prey and more non-meat foods than the MIS 5 period. They had shallower and narrower jaws than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today, which indicated that they could take only small to medium-sized prey. They exhibited a lower percentage of tooth breakage comparable with MIS-3 wolves. However, they had the highest percentage of moderately worn teeth.<ref name=flower2014/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 82,000 MIS 5A\n| Paleoenvironment was cold, open tundra with summer temperatures between 7&nbsp;\u00b0C and 11&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperatures between \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C and \u221230&nbsp;\u00b0C dominated by reindeer and bison. A large form of brown bear was top predator, with no hyena at this time. The wolves of MIS 5 were larger in body size than those found in Sweden today. These wolves suffered from a severe climate, low prey availability and dietary stress leading to a more carnivorous diet, with increased scavenging of frozen carcasses and bone consumption. They developed strong jaws and the highest flesh-slicing ability compared to the other wolves, with shallower jaws than the modern wolf but broader and deeper jaws than MIS 7 and MIS 5 wolves. They exhibited the longest and narrowest upper P4 that suggests improved slicing ability, and longest upper M1 and M2 but with reduced width and therefore reduced crushing ability, indicating a hypercarnivore. They exhibited a higher percentage of tooth breakage and severely worn teeth compared to the other wolves, and may have been using their upper P4 and lower m1 to crush bone rather than their molars, leading to a higher frequency of damage.<ref name=flower2014/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | 57,000 MIS 3\n| Paleoenvironment of open grasslands with summer temperature of around 12&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperature around \u221220&nbsp;\u00b0C dominated by woolly mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horse, and giant deer. Competitors included the lion, brown bear, and the spotted hyena as the top carnivore. The wolves of MIS 3 were smaller in body size than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today. These wolves were out-competed by the lion and hyena, leading to a more omnivorous diet with increased crushing ability in an open environment that supported more types of prey and more non-meat foods than the MIS 5 period. They had shallower and narrower jaws than MIS 5 wolves and those found in Sweden today, which indicated that they could take only small to medium-sized prey. They exhibited a lower percentage of tooth breakage comparable with MIS-7 wolves with moderate tooth wear.<ref name=flower2014/>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | Today (Sweden)\n| Wolves have been extirpated in Britain but not in Sweden, where the temperatures are similar to those of Britain during the MIS 7 period. Environment of [[boreal forest]] with summer temperatures between 14&nbsp;\u00b0C and 18&nbsp;\u00b0C and winter temperatures between 1&nbsp;\u00b0C and \u221210&nbsp;\u00b0C. The prey species includes elk, reindeer, roe deer, boar, hares, rabbit, and beaver. Competitors include the brown bear and lynx but the wolf is top carnivore. The wolves found in Sweden today are smaller in body size than MIS 5 wolves but larger than those of MIS 7 and MIS 3.  The upper M1 and M2 length is longer than for MIS 7 and MIS 3 wolves, and the jaws deeper and broader, which indicates the ability to hunt and subdue large prey. However, the large molars retained a crushing ability and to process non-meat foods. These wolves live in boreal forests where small to medium game is hard to detect and labour-intensive to subdue, leading to an adaption for hunting larger game with higher reward. They are hypercarnivores similar to MIS 5 wolves but not with the same slicing ability.<ref name=flower2014/> \n|-\n|}\n\nDuring the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] 20,000 YBP, the [[Mammoth steppe|Pleistocene steppe]] stretched across northern and central Eurasia and through [[Beringia]] into North America. The Pleistocene [[Beringian wolf|wolves of Beringia]], and perhaps those across the steppe, were adapted to this habitat. Their tooth and skull morphology indicates that they specialized in preying on now-extinct [[Pleistocene megafauna]], and their tooth wear indicates that their behavior was different to modern wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=leonard2014/><ref name=fox2008/><ref name=baryshnikov2009/> This highlights the success of ''C. lupus'' as a species in adapting to different environmental conditions.<ref name=flower2014/> This gray wolf ecomorph became extinct at the end of the glaciation, along with the horse and other species on which it depended, and was replaced by wolves from southern North America. This indicates that specialized wolf ecomorphs can become extinct when their environment changes even though the habitat may still support other wolves.<ref name=leonard2014/> Wolves went through a [[population bottleneck]] 20,000 YBP that coincides with the Last Glacial Maximum,<ref name=freedman2014/><ref name=pilot2014/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=leonard2014/> which indicates that many wolf populations may have gone extinct at the same time as the Beringian wolves.<ref name=leonard2014/>\n\nThere are a small number of ''Canis'' remains that have been found at Goyet Cave, Belgium (36,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2009/> Razboinichya Cave, Russia (33,500 YBP)<ref name=ovodov2011/>  Kostenki 8, Russia (33,500\u201326,500 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2015/> Predmosti, Czech Republic (31,000 YBP)<ref name=germonpre2012/> and Eliseevichi 1, Russia (17,000 YBP).<ref name=sablin2002/> Based on cranial morphometric study of the characteristics thought to be associated with the domestication process, these have been proposed as early Paleolithic dogs.<ref name=germonpre2015/> These characteristics of shortened rostrum, tooth crowding, and absence or rotation of premolars have been documented in both ancient and modern wolves.<ref name=leonard2007/><ref name=perri2016/><ref name=flower2014/><ref name=boudadi2010/><ref name=dimitrijevic2015/><ref name=crockford2012/> Rather than representing early dogs, these specimens may represent \"a morphologically distinct local, now extinct, population of wolves\".<ref name=perri2016/><ref name=larson2012/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=abe1999>{{cite book|last=Abe|first=H.|year=1999|chapter=Diversity and conservation of mammals of Japan|editor-last=Yokohata|editor-first=Y.|editor2-last=Nakamura|editor2-first=S.|title=Recent Advances in the Biology of Japanese Insectivore|publisher=Hiba Society of Natural History|location=[[Sh\u014dbara, Hiroshima|Sh\u014dbara]]|pages=89\u2013104}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=aggarwal2007>{{Cite journal | last1 = Aggarwal | first1 = R.

She gained a cadetship at [[WIN Television]]'s [[Canberra]] bureau in 1990, later becoming their weather presenter. Doyle then moved to [[Prime Television]] in 1993, where she was a news anchor and general reporter.\n\nAfter her stint at Prime ended in 1995, Doyle joined the Seven Network as a Canberra-based political reporter before moving to Sydney where she read the news on ''11AM'', reported the news and read the afternoon updates. Doyle was one of ''Sunrise's'' original hosts before it was axed in 1999, before being resurrected in 2000, and which she rejoined in 2002. In 1999 she was the fill in presenter of the last bulletin of 11AM due to the incumbent presenter [[Anne Fulwood]] having already relocated to Melbourne.<ref>{{Citation|last=TelevisionAU|title=HSV7 Eleven AM final edition 1999|date=2014-05-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU14ER2bzxI|accessdate=2016-07-19}}</ref>  She also had a stint reading the ''[[Seven News|Seven Late News]]''.\n\nIn 2000, she took over as host of Sydney's ''[[Today Tonight]]'' following the departure of [[Stan Grant (journalist)|Stan Grant]].

Together, Doyle and Koch under the guidance of Executive producer Adam Boland, surpassed their incumbent opposition and market leaders, ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' on the [[Nine Network]]. They built the program from a virtually zero viewer base to be the leading breakfast television program in Australia and there it remained throughout Doyle's tenure on the program. She was then dubbed the 'Queen of Australian Brekky TV'.\n\nIn 2003, Doyle enjoyed a very public pregnancy with her second child, who was born in December of that year.\n\nDoyle was nominated for the Silver Logie as Most Popular Television Presenter in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. She was the only female nominated in that category.\n\nDoyle was involved in legal proceedings in which it was alleged she identified a minor who was divorcing his parents. The divorce case was being heard in the Victorian Children's Court and because the boy was only 14 years old he couldn't be named. But ''Sunrise'', as well as a number of other news outlets, including the ''[[Herald Sun|Sunday Herald Sun]]'' and ''Today Tonight'', allegedly identified him and the journalists/presenters were charged with contempt of court. The journalists and presenters/hosts were all acquitted but the Seven Network, its news director, ''Today Tonight''{{'}}s executive producer and the ''Sunday Herald Sun'' and its editor-in-chief were convicted.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nWhile at the helm of Sunrise she was at the front line of many of Australia's biggest stories of the era including, but not limited to, [[Beaconsfield Mine collapse]] and the [[2010\u201311 Queensland floods]], and international stories such as the Royal Wedding.\n\nOn 20 June 2013, Doyle announced that she would be stepping down as ''Sunrise'' co-host to take on a national role within the Seven Network. She presented her final show on 9 August of the same year. Her farewell program was the highest rating edition of the show that year.\n\n===After ''Sunrise''===\nIt was revealed in August 2013 that Doyle would present a new national bulletin of [[Seven News|''Seven Afternoon News'']] at 4pm on weekdays with former ''Today Tonight'' host [[Matthew White (journalist)|Matt White]], as well as a new national bulletin ''[[Seven News|Seven News at 7]] ''on Seven's digital channel [[7Two]].

In 1999 she was the fill in presenter of the last bulletin of 11AM due to the incumbent presenter [[Anne Fulwood]] having already relocated to Melbourne.<ref>{{Citation|last=TelevisionAU|title=HSV7 Eleven AM final edition 1999|date=2014-05-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kU14ER2bzxI|accessdate=2016-07-19}}</ref>  She also had a stint reading the ''[[Seven News|Seven Late News]]''.\n\nIn 2000, she took over as host of Sydney's ''[[Today Tonight]]'' following the departure of [[Stan Grant (journalist)|Stan Grant]].

Together, Doyle and Koch under the guidance of Executive producer Adam Boland, surpassed their incumbent opposition and market leaders, ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|Today]]'' on the [[Nine Network]]. They built the program from a virtually zero viewer base to be the leading breakfast television program in Australia and there it remained throughout Doyle's tenure on the program. She was then dubbed the 'Queen of Australian Brekky TV'.\n\nIn 2003, Doyle enjoyed a very public pregnancy with her second child, who was born in December of that year.\n\nDoyle was nominated for the Silver Logie as Most Popular Television Presenter in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010. She was the only female nominated in that category.\n\nDoyle was involved in legal proceedings in which it was alleged she identified a minor who was divorcing his parents. The divorce case was being heard in the Victorian Children's Court and because the boy was only 14 years old he couldn't be named. But ''Sunrise'', as well as a number of other news outlets, including the ''[[Herald Sun|Sunday Herald Sun]]'' and ''Today Tonight'', allegedly identified him and the journalists/presenters were charged with contempt of court. The journalists and presenters/hosts were all acquitted but the Seven Network, its news director, ''Today Tonight''{{'}}s executive producer and the ''Sunday Herald Sun'' and its editor-in-chief were convicted.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nWhile at the helm of Sunrise she was at the front line of many of Australia's biggest stories of the era including, but not limited to, [[Beaconsfield Mine collapse]] and the [[2010\u201311 Queensland floods]], and international stories such as the Royal Wedding.\n\nOn 20 June 2013, Doyle announced that she would be stepping down as ''Sunrise'' co-host to take on a national role within the Seven Network. She presented her final show on 9 August of the same year. Her farewell program was the highest rating edition of the show that year.\n\n===After ''Sunrise''===\nIt was revealed in August 2013 that Doyle would present a new national bulletin of [[Seven News|''Seven Afternoon News'']] at 4pm on weekdays with former ''Today Tonight'' host [[Matthew White (journalist)|Matt White]], as well as a new national bulletin ''[[Seven News|Seven News at 7]] ''on Seven's digital channel [[7Two]]. This bulletin was discontinued in May 2014.\n\nDoyle began presenting ''Seven News at 7 ''on 12 August and ''Seven Afternoon News'' on 19 August.

It sold over 10,000 copies in its first print run. In 2014, she released her second book, ''Alphabet Soup''. The memoir was the biggest selling Australian memoir in the market during its first few months on bookshelves. Doyle and Koch also co-hosted another [[Seven Network]] production ''[[Where Are They Now?

It is situated {{convert|38|mi|km|abbr=off}} north of [[Dundee]] between the mouths of the North and South Esk rivers. It is the northernmost coastal town in Angus and developed as a natural harbour that traded in skins, hides and cured salmon in medieval times.\n\nWith a population of approximately 12,000, the town functions as a port, but the major employer is [[GlaxoSmithKline]], which was saved from closure in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contractorsunlimited.co.uk/news/060406-glaxosmithkline.shtml|title=GlaxoSmithKline - Montrose Plant|author=|date=|website=www.contractorsunlimited.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2018}}</ref> The skyline of Montrose is dominated by the {{convert|220|ft|m|adj=on}} [[steeple (architecture)|steeple]] of [[Montrose Old and St Andrew's Church|Old and St Andrew's Church]], designed by [[James Gillespie Graham]] and built between 1832 and 1834.\n\nMontrose is a town with a wealth of architecture, and is a centre for international trade.

Michael Hogan, ''Stone of Morphie'', 2007, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.
