Yoga's effects are to some extent shared with other forms of [[exercise]],<ref name=\"Novella 2013\" group=O/> though it differs in the amount of stretching involved, and because of its frequent use of long holds and relaxation, in its ability to reduce stress. Yoga is here treated separately from [[meditation]], which has effects of its own, though yoga and meditation are combined in some schools of yoga.\n\nYoga has been studied scientifically since the 19th century [[physiology]] experiments of [[N. C. Paul]]. The early 20th century pioneers [[Yogendra]] and [[Kuvalayananda]] both set up institutes to study yoga systematically.\n\nYoga helps to maintain bone strength, joint mobility, and joint stability. It improves posture, muscle strength, coordination, and confidence, in turn reducing the risk of injury and bone fracture. As it is generally slow and conducted with awareness, it may be safer than many other sports; but some postures such as [[Sirsasana|headstand]], [[Sarvangasana|shoulderstand]], and [[lotus position]] have been reported as causes of injury.\n\nYoga is also used directly [[Yoga for therapeutic purposes|as therapy]], especially for psychological conditions such as [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], but the evidence for this remains weak. Yoga has sometimes been marketed with [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] claims for specific benefits, when it may be no better than other forms of exercise in those cases;<ref name=\"Novella 2013\" group=O/> and some claims for its effects on particular organs, such as that forward bends eject toxins from the liver, are entirely unfounded. Reviewers have noted the need for more high-quality studies of yoga's effects.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 19th century, the Bengali physician [[N. C. Paul]] began the study of the [[physiology]] of yoga with his 1851 book ''Treatise on Yoga Philosophy'', noting that yoga can raise [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the blood ([[hypercapnia]]).{{sfn|Broad|2012|pp=20ff}}{{sfn|Singleton|2010|p=52}}{{sfn|Paul|1882}}\n\nEarly in the 20th century, two pioneers of [[yoga as exercise]] in India, [[Yogendra]] and [[Kuvalayananda]], worked to make [[Ha\u1e6dha yoga]] acceptable, seeking scientific evidence for the health benefits of yoga postures ([[asana]]s) and yoga breathing ([[pranayama]]).

This causes blood vessels in the brain to constrict, reducing the brain's uptake of oxygen, resulting in symptoms such as [[dizziness]] and [[fainting]].

Breathing. 2:1 Breathing}}\n\nBreathing can equally be used to energise the body. The pranayama method of [[bhastrika]] (bellows breath) and the [[satkarma]] purification of [[kapalabhati]] (skull polishing) both energise the body with vigorous [[abdominal breathing]], using the diaphragm to make the abdomen move in and out.{{sfn|Coulter|2007|loc=Chapter 2.

He writes that instead, fast vigorous breathing as with bhastrika may indeed feel exhilarating, as B. K. S. Iyengar reported, but it lowers the level of [[carbon dioxide]] in the blood. This causes blood vessels in the brain to constrict, reducing the brain's uptake of oxygen, resulting in symptoms such as [[dizziness]] and [[fainting]].

In return, he was promised military and economic aid from Henry II in order to fight against the forces of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V of Habsburg]].\n[[File:Henri2entranceMetz.jpg|thumb|left|Entrance of King Henri II in [[Metz]] on 18 April 1552.]]\n\nAfter [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] Charles V had defeated a number of revolting Protestant princes in the [[Schmalkaldic War]], he in 1548 issued the ''geharnischt'' (sharply worded) [[Augsburg Interim]] in order to re-integrate the Lutheran movement into the established Catholic Church and to prevent the split of the Empire. To defend their autonomy, several Protestant [[Imperial State]]s reacted with the 1551 Alliance of [[Torgau]]; first of all the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] elector Maurice of [[House of Wettin|Wettin]], who in the Schmalkaldic War had been a strong supporter of the emperor, but also [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|William IV of Hesse-Kassel]], the warlike [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] margrave [[Albert Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach|Albert Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach]] and his cousin the [[Duchy of Prussia|Prussian]] duke [[Albert, Duke of Prussia|Albert]].\n\nAt that time, Maurice was charged by the emperor to campaign and subdue the rebellious city of [[Magdeburg]]. When he changed sides, a peace was arranged with the citizens. Meanwhile, French troops under King Henry II marched against the [[Rhine]] to occupy the Three Bishoprics. After the allied Lutheran princes had signed the Treaty of Chambord, their forces campaigned [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] in the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg hereditary lands]] and forced Charles V to flee toward the [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthian]] town of [[Villach]]. In August 1552 his younger brother Archduke [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]] concluded the [[Peace of Passau]], whereby he formally accepted the Lutheran [[Augsburg Confession]], confirmed by the emperor himself in the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]].\n\nOnce the armistice with the Protestant princes was declared, Charles V during the [[Italian War of 1551\u201359]] made several attempts to forcibly regain the overlordship over the Three Bishoprics, the disposal of which was his Imperial privilege. However, his troops were finally defeated by the French under the command of Duke [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Francis of Guise]] at the 1554 [[Battle of Renty]]. The emperor abdicated two years later and his successor Ferdinand I made no further efforts to win back the dioceses. The incorporation into France was officially acknowledged by the Empire in the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]].\n\n==Consequences==\nThe Treaty of Chambord was a typical international political example for an agreement at the expense of other parties (\"ius quaesitum tertio\", in English a \"third-party beneficiary contract\", in [[French language|French]] \u201cpromesse de porte-fort\u201d). The [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|princes]] acting on the [[Holy Roman Empire|German]] side had given [[Kingdom of France|France]] covenants, which to make they had had neither the right nor any authorization. They ceded rights over [[Imperial State|imperial territory]] to a foreign ruler, over which - not only, but mostly because neither was anything near being their very own - they did not execute anything such as a command. Thus the accord was of no account according to judicial standards.\n\nFrance used the convention as a pretence to militarily occupy the Three Bishoprics, to subsequently remove them out of the [[Imperial circles|collective]] of the Holy Roman Empire and to incorporate them into its own territory. This approach of the French crown was symptomatic for the French policy during the next decades. It was directed at the utilisation of conflicts between the Emperor and German princes and to support the emperor's respective opponents, so to take own advantage out of it.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Three Bishoprics]]\n*[[List of treaties]]\n\n==References==\n{{no footnotes|date=September 2016}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061010153411/http://vietnamnews.vnanet.vn/2004-01/15/Columns/In%20History.htm January 15 in History]\n*[http://p2.www.britannica.com/eb/article-9040028/Henry-II#173301.hook Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica - Henry II]\n*[http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/be-whtpw.html P\u00e9ruwelz (Municipality, Province of Hainaut, Belgium)]\n*[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/france/france15151559for.html Foreign Policy under Francis I, Henri II, 1515-1559]\n\n{{coord|47|36|57|N|1|31|02|E|region:FR-F_type:landmark_source:kolossus-dewiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Treaty of Chambord}}\n[[Category:1552 in France]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Holy Roman Empire|Chambord]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Kingdom of France|Chambord]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Electorate of Saxony]]\n[[Category:1552 in the Holy Roman Empire]]\n[[Category:1552 treaties]]\n[[Category:France\u2013Holy Roman Empire relations]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:France Loir-et-Cher Chambord Chateau 03.jpg|thumb|Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]]\nThe '''Treaty of Chambord''' was an agreement signed on 15 January 1552 at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]] between the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] King [[Henry II of France]] and three [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant]] princes of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] led by Elector [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony|Maurice of Saxony]].

He was one of two peers suspended for six months from admittance to the House of Lords after the [[2009 cash for influence scandal]], the first peers to be suspended since the 17th century.\n\n==Early career==\nThomas Taylor was born in Blackburn, the son of James and Edith Taylor.  He was taught at Blakey Moor elementary school, but left aged fourteen to go to work as a shop assistant in the local Co-op.  Later on he was selected as branch representative chairman of [[USDAW]].\n\nStill only twenty-one years old Thomas Taylor married Kathleen Nurton in 1950, they had a son, Paul Taylor from their union.  In 1954 he was elected to [[Blackburn]] Town Council, later becoming chairman of the education committee.  In 1960 he was appointed a JP on the Blackburn bench.  A Congregationalist and committed Christian, he was named president of the Free Church Council in 1963.<ref>Burke's Peerage, 107th ed., vol.III (2003)</ref>  Appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the [[1969 Birthday Honours]] list,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=44863 |date=14 June 1969 |page=5973 |supp=y}}</ref> he was finally raised to Leader of the council from 1972\u201376, on the recommendation of fellow church-goer and former leader [[Sir George Eddie]].  For his services local government he was promoted to [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[1974 Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=46310 |date=15 June 1974 |page=6801 |supp=y}}</ref>\n\nThroughout a period of industrial decline for British textiles, Taylor gained a reputation for handling the situation sensitively by importing immigrants as cheap labour to work in the factories.  His management of education was considered one of the best local authority areas in the country deploying a maximum 7% solution to the ethnic mix of local schools: to ensure social integration students were bussed across town.  He became leader of education services on Lancashire County Council, as well as being Chairman of the juvenile bench.  A consensual politician in the tradition of Hugh Gaitskell he steered comprehensive education through despite some concerns in the town.  There he developed the Rochdale tradition of co-operative societies on the council bringing together teachers and parents on a corporatist model.  He utilised the leverage of businesses to help finance educational needs by brokerage of a third way for community uses of premises out of school hours and in the holidays.<ref name=whowho>{{cite web |title=Taylor of Blackburn, Baron | url = http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U37058 | publisher=[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]] | accessdate =6 December 2011 }}</ref>  He was not a particular friend of Barbara Castle the local MP who was so close to Wilson, but was delighted to influence the succession of [[Jack Straw]] to the seat on her retirement.  Taylor's socialist circle included [[James Callaghan]], so when he lost his seat on Blackburn Council in 1976 he was a natural recruit for the labour peerage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/29/lord-taylor-of-blackburn-obituary|title=Lord Taylor of Blackburn obituary|first=Julia|last=Langdon|date=29 November 2016|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> His ''froideur'' for Castle was not helped when he was asked to share an office at the House of Lords.\n\n==National education and Labour governments==\nTaylor was an acolyte of Harold Wilson.  Sitting on the Public School Commission in 1958 he attacked Public Schools Headmasters Conference reluctance to relinquish their independent status.  Their refusal to integrate in the comprehensive system caused Labour and Taylor to threaten class warfare for failing to modernise.  In 1972 Taylor was embroiled in a row to dismiss a communist English lecturer, Dr David Craig at the new Lancaster University of which he was a co-founder and deputy Pro-Chancellor.<ref name=whowho />  Students staged a sit-in when the Vice-Chancellor refused to lift a threat of disciplinary action against the political agitation.  Taylor was remitted to act independently but investigate the causes.  Taylor's Report of July 1972 exonerated the local authority of any blame, but thought the whole case has poisoned the atmosphere and culture of the university.  Craig was reinstated but outside the faculty, while the Vice-Chancellor archly refused any assistance for delegations.  The following year he accused the Conservative government of a failure to invest: a creaking management had invested the system with paralysis by analysis.\n\nIn his role as president of the [[Association of Education Committees]] he continued to press for more investment in schools and universities.  A somewhat cynical approach was dictated by his disdain for the peerage, \"or as third best chose a mother who has a degree.\"  He carried forward the tripartite industrial strategies of Labour's super-ministries into the new Wilsonian era, when the Education Secretary [[Reg Prentice]] asked him to report on school management.

He was one of two peers suspended for six months from admittance to the House of Lords after the [[2009 cash for influence scandal]], the first peers to be suspended since the 17th century.\n\n==Early career==\nThomas Taylor was born in Blackburn, the son of James and Edith Taylor.  He was taught at Blakey Moor elementary school, but left aged fourteen to go to work as a shop assistant in the local Co-op.  Later on he was selected as branch representative chairman of [[USDAW]].\n\nStill only twenty-one years old Thomas Taylor married Kathleen Nurton in 1950, they had a son, Paul Taylor from their union.  In 1954 he was elected to [[Blackburn]] Town Council, later becoming chairman of the education committee.  In 1960 he was appointed a JP on the Blackburn bench.  A Congregationalist and committed Christian, he was named president of the Free Church Council in 1963.<ref>Burke's Peerage, 107th ed., vol.III (2003)</ref>  Appointed [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the [[1969 Birthday Honours]] list,<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=44863 |date=14 June 1969 |page=5973 |supp=y}}</ref> he was finally raised to Leader of the council from 1972\u201376, on the recommendation of fellow church-goer and former leader [[Sir George Eddie]].  For his services local government he was promoted to [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[1974 Birthday Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=46310 |date=15 June 1974 |page=6801 |supp=y}}</ref>\n\nThroughout a period of industrial decline for British textiles, Taylor gained a reputation for handling the situation sensitively by importing immigrants as cheap labour to work in the factories.  His management of education was considered one of the best local authority areas in the country deploying a maximum 7% solution to the ethnic mix of local schools: to ensure social integration students were bussed across town.  He became leader of education services on Lancashire County Council, as well as being Chairman of the juvenile bench.  A consensual politician in the tradition of Hugh Gaitskell he steered comprehensive education through despite some concerns in the town.  There he developed the Rochdale tradition of co-operative societies on the council bringing together teachers and parents on a corporatist model.  He utilised the leverage of businesses to help finance educational needs by brokerage of a third way for community uses of premises out of school hours and in the holidays.<ref name=whowho>{{cite web |title=Taylor of Blackburn, Baron | url = http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U37058 | publisher=[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who]] | accessdate =6 December 2011 }}</ref>  He was not a particular friend of Barbara Castle the local MP who was so close to Wilson, but was delighted to influence the succession of [[Jack Straw]] to the seat on her retirement.  Taylor's socialist circle included [[James Callaghan]], so when he lost his seat on Blackburn Council in 1976 he was a natural recruit for the labour peerage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/nov/29/lord-taylor-of-blackburn-obituary|title=Lord Taylor of Blackburn obituary|first=Julia|last=Langdon|date=29 November 2016|publisher=|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> His ''froideur'' for Castle was not helped when he was asked to share an office at the House of Lords.\n\n==National education and Labour governments==\nTaylor was an acolyte of Harold Wilson.  Sitting on the Public School Commission in 1958 he attacked Public Schools Headmasters Conference reluctance to relinquish their independent status.  Their refusal to integrate in the comprehensive system caused Labour and Taylor to threaten class warfare for failing to modernise.  In 1972 Taylor was embroiled in a row to dismiss a communist English lecturer, Dr David Craig at the new Lancaster University of which he was a co-founder and deputy Pro-Chancellor.<ref name=whowho />  Students staged a sit-in when the Vice-Chancellor refused to lift a threat of disciplinary action against the political agitation.  Taylor was remitted to act independently but investigate the causes.  Taylor's Report of July 1972 exonerated the local authority of any blame, but thought the whole case has poisoned the atmosphere and culture of the university.  Craig was reinstated but outside the faculty, while the Vice-Chancellor archly refused any assistance for delegations.  The following year he accused the Conservative government of a failure to invest: a creaking management had invested the system with paralysis by analysis.\n\nIn his role as president of the [[Association of Education Committees]] he continued to press for more investment in schools and universities.  A somewhat cynical approach was dictated by his disdain for the peerage, \"or as third best chose a mother who has a degree.\"  He carried forward the tripartite industrial strategies of Labour's super-ministries into the new Wilsonian era, when the Education Secretary [[Reg Prentice]] asked him to report on school management.  The report ''New Partnership for Our Schools''  was the first attempt to put schools on the same footing as independents by giving overall management control to a board of Governors, in co-operation with the teachers and parents.<ref name=whowho /><ref name=a-division-bio>{{Cite document|url=http://www.adivisiongroup.com/v.asp?level2id=5903&depth=1&rootid=5903|title=A Division - Our Chairman|publisher=A Division Group|accessdate=2009-01-28|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201134740/http://www.adivisiongroup.com/v.asp?level2id=5903&depth=1&rootid=5903|archivedate=1 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1977-80 he was Chairman of the [[Electricity Consultative Council]] for the North West and a member of the Board of [[Norweb]].

With the home team winning 1\u20130 in both matches, the [[aggregate score]] was tied 1\u20131, and, with no away goal advantage, the play-off was decided by a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]], which Australia won 4\u20132 in order to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup]] for the first time since the [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974 tournament]].\n\nIt was the second consecutive [[FIFA World Cup]] where the two sides had played each other for a place in the tournament.

This experience led him to launch other well known companies in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, employing more than one hundred employees through B&B Communications.  Brown continued on the path to become a successful business owner, entrepreneur, investor, and philanthropist.\n\nBrown is Chairman of Education Online Service Corp. (EOServe Corp), an organization dedicated to helping colleges and universities maximize online higher education. His strong desire to help the underserved market of [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs) extend their geographical reach with online marketing technology was the initial inspiration for creating Education Online Services Corporation as well as the fact that online degree programs are now being considered as \"strategically important\" by HBCUs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidehighered.com/news/2010/11/23/hbcu|title=Modest Gains for Black Colleges Online|work=insidehighered.com}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2009, Brown hired long-time [[civil rights]] leader [[Benjamin Chavis|Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.]] as President of EOServe Corp. Together they announced a historic partnership with [[Morris Brown College]] in April 2009 to lead the resurgence of that institution by enhancing its academic offering and aggressively recruiting and enrolling more students. By August of that same year Education Online Services launched a full, Internet-based degree program in Organizational Leadership and Management for Morris Brown College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campustechnology.com/articles/2009/05/04/struggling-morris-brown-college-takes-courses-online.aspx|title=Struggling Morris Brown College Takes Courses Online \u2013 Campus Technology|work=campustechnology.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the success of Morris Brown College, other schools quickly followed suit and partnered with Education Online Services Corporation such as [[Langston University]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eddnews.com/education-online-services-corp-and-langston-university-announce-launch-of-online-degree-program/22313/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425150150/http://eddnews.com/education-online-services-corp-and-langston-university-announce-launch-of-online-degree-program/22313/ |archive-date=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Jackson State University]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnewsuniversitydirectory.com/articles/university-creates-online-bachelorrsquos-degree-in_11017.aspx?mcid|title=University Creates Online Bachelor's Degree in Childcare and Family Education|work=U.S. News University Directory}}</ref> [[Virginia University of Lynchburg]] and [[Tougaloo College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/online3-education/articles/2010/12/23/more-hbcus-offer-online-degrees.html|title=More HBCUs Offer Online Degrees|author=Brian Burnsed|work=US News & World Report}}</ref> In August 2011, EOServe Corp. and the College of Business at Jackson State University launched the [[Master of Business Administration]] online degree program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hbcubuzz.com/jackson-state-university-and-education-online-services-corporation-announce-launch-of-online-mba-program|title=HBCU Buzz \u2013 Jackson State University and Education Online Services Corporation Announce Launch of Online MBA Program|author=HBCU|date=June 29, 2011|work=HBCU Buzz}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, EOServe Corp. partnered with the National Association For Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO). This partnership provides NAFEO's 123 member institutions with a cost-effective way of expanding their reach beyond their campuses, to offer their current curriculum to thousands of students who want a degree but for whom a campus-based experience is not optimal.\n\n== Other memberships ==\nBrown serves as Chairman of the Advancement through Education Program, (formerly known as the Under21Foundation), an organization committed to decreasing generational poverty through education by providing financial assistance to mothers between the ages of 21\u201364 who lack high school diplomas.\n\nHe is also an honorary member of the U.S. board of directors for Upliftment Jamaica, an organization committed to empowering impoverished communities throughout [[Jamaica]] and the [[Caribbean]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nBrown met his future wife and business partner, Roshunda Young Brown (born September 23, 1969) of Sulphur Springs, Texas, on the campus of the University of Texas during the summer of 1989.  They dated for one and half years and married on December 1, 1990 in Dallas, Texas.  They have two daughters, Kailee and Kiersten, and they currently reside in Parkland, Florida.\n\nIn 2015 Brown lost all his businesses due to mismanagement on his part. His fake life of being a business man and philanthropist was all a lie to entice investors to invest in his company. Ezell no longer runs any companies and has been evicted from his residence over 10 times in the past 3 years.\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nIn the summer of 2008, Ezell and Roshunda Brown founded the Ezell Brown Foundation, a privately owned, non-profit corporation whose mission and purpose is to provide educational opportunity scholarships for underprivileged persons who wish to obtain a high school diploma. The Foundation works closely with numerous corporate sponsors to achieve its fundraising and educational goals.\n\nAn independent review board oversees the scholarship program and determines the eligibility of applicants. The review board may also grant access to Higher Education Partner Programs on a test basis to qualified efforts and applicants.  The Board votes on a simple majority basis within approximately one month after applications are collected.\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 2009 Ezell Brown was honored with The Steward Wiley/Wesley John Gaines President's Leadership Award from Morris Brown College.  This award honors persons who have provided exemplary leadership and demonstrated innovative ways to improve their organizations, community, or environment.

This experience led him to launch other well known companies in the Dallas/Fort Worth area, employing more than one hundred employees through B&B Communications.  Brown continued on the path to become a successful business owner, entrepreneur, investor, and philanthropist.\n\nBrown is Chairman of Education Online Service Corp. (EOServe Corp), an organization dedicated to helping colleges and universities maximize online higher education. His strong desire to help the underserved market of [[historically black colleges and universities]] (HBCUs) extend their geographical reach with online marketing technology was the initial inspiration for creating Education Online Services Corporation as well as the fact that online degree programs are now being considered as \"strategically important\" by HBCUs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidehighered.com/news/2010/11/23/hbcu|title=Modest Gains for Black Colleges Online|work=insidehighered.com}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2009, Brown hired long-time [[civil rights]] leader [[Benjamin Chavis|Dr. Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.]] as President of EOServe Corp. Together they announced a historic partnership with [[Morris Brown College]] in April 2009 to lead the resurgence of that institution by enhancing its academic offering and aggressively recruiting and enrolling more students. By August of that same year Education Online Services launched a full, Internet-based degree program in Organizational Leadership and Management for Morris Brown College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campustechnology.com/articles/2009/05/04/struggling-morris-brown-college-takes-courses-online.aspx|title=Struggling Morris Brown College Takes Courses Online \u2013 Campus Technology|work=campustechnology.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the success of Morris Brown College, other schools quickly followed suit and partnered with Education Online Services Corporation such as [[Langston University]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eddnews.com/education-online-services-corp-and-langston-university-announce-launch-of-online-degree-program/22313/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425150150/http://eddnews.com/education-online-services-corp-and-langston-university-announce-launch-of-online-degree-program/22313/ |archive-date=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Jackson State University]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usnewsuniversitydirectory.com/articles/university-creates-online-bachelorrsquos-degree-in_11017.aspx?mcid|title=University Creates Online Bachelor's Degree in Childcare and Family Education|work=U.S. News University Directory}}</ref> [[Virginia University of Lynchburg]] and [[Tougaloo College]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/online3-education/articles/2010/12/23/more-hbcus-offer-online-degrees.html|title=More HBCUs Offer Online Degrees|author=Brian Burnsed|work=US News & World Report}}</ref> In August 2011, EOServe Corp. and the College of Business at Jackson State University launched the [[Masters of Business Administration]] online degree program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hbcubuzz.com/jackson-state-university-and-education-online-services-corporation-announce-launch-of-online-mba-program|title=HBCU Buzz \u2013 Jackson State University and Education Online Services Corporation Announce Launch of Online MBA Program|author=HBCU|date=June 29, 2011|work=HBCU Buzz}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, EOServe Corp. partnered with the National Association For Equal Opportunity in Higher Education (NAFEO). This partnership provides NAFEO's 123 member institutions with a cost-effective way of expanding their reach beyond their campuses, to offer their current curriculum to thousands of students who want a degree but for whom a campus-based experience is not optimal.\n\n== Other memberships ==\nBrown serves as Chairman of the Advancement through Education Program, (formerly known as the Under21Foundation), an organization committed to decreasing generational poverty through education by providing financial assistance to mothers between the ages of 21\u201364 who lack high school diplomas.\n\nHe is also an honorary member of the U.S. board of directors for Upliftment Jamaica, an organization committed to empowering impoverished communities throughout [[Jamaica]] and the [[Caribbean]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nBrown met his future wife and business partner, Roshunda Young Brown (born September 23, 1969) of Sulphur Springs, Texas, on the campus of the University of Texas during the summer of 1989.  They dated for one and half years and married on December 1, 1990 in Dallas, Texas.  They have two daughters, Kailee and Kiersten, and they currently reside in Parkland, Florida.\n\nIn 2015 Brown lost all his businesses due to mismanagement on his part. His fake life of being a business man and philanthropist was all a lie to entice investors to invest in his company. Ezell no longer runs any companies and has been evicted from his residence over 10 times in the past 3 years.\n\n== Philanthropy ==\nIn the summer of 2008, Ezell and Roshunda Brown founded the Ezell Brown Foundation, a privately owned, non-profit corporation whose mission and purpose is to provide educational opportunity scholarships for underprivileged persons who wish to obtain a high school diploma. The Foundation works closely with numerous corporate sponsors to achieve its fundraising and educational goals.\n\nAn independent review board oversees the scholarship program and determines the eligibility of applicants. The review board may also grant access to Higher Education Partner Programs on a test basis to qualified efforts and applicants.  The Board votes on a simple majority basis within approximately one month after applications are collected.\n\n== Recognition ==\nIn 2009 Ezell Brown was honored with The Steward Wiley/Wesley John Gaines President's Leadership Award from Morris Brown College.  This award honors persons who have provided exemplary leadership and demonstrated innovative ways to improve their organizations, community, or environment.  They have given generously and unselfishly to the development of others to become leaders and have inspired others to reach their full potential in pursuit of a common vision.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.urbanprofessionals.com/5_pr_detail.php?id_pr=163%2F |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425145917/http://www.urbanprofessionals.com/5_pr_detail.php?id_pr=163%2F |archive-date=25 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brown, Ezell}}\n[[Category:American technology chief executives]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Morris Brown College alumni]]\n[[Category:People from San Antonio]]\n", "name_user": "EdmundT", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCareer:Spelling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezell_Brown"}
