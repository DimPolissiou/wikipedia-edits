Historically, it was priced similar to cars on the [[Compact executive car|compact luxury]] spectrum; but it has always been sized closely to its mid-size rivals. The third generation competes directly with the mid-size luxury cars. Initially available only as a 4-door sedan on the [[GM Sigma platform]], GM had offered the second generation CTS in three body styles: 4-door sedan, 2-door coupe, and 5-door sport wagon also using the Sigma platform \u2014 and the third generation was offered only as a sedan, using a stretched version of the [[GM Alpha platform]].\n\nThe third-generation CTS's indirect successor is the smaller CT5, which, like the first- and second-generation CTS, takes on the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, while maintaining its 5 Series/E-Class size.\n\n[[Wayne Cherry]] and Kip Wasenko designed the exterior of the first generation CTS, marking the production debut of a [[design language]] (marketed as \"Art and Science\") first seen on the [[Cadillac Evoq|Evoq]] concept car.

The 3.2&nbsp;L engine went out of production in 2005, when a new 2.8&nbsp;L version of the [[DOHC]] V6 debuted in an entry-level version of the CTS. In Europe, the 2.8&nbsp;L replaced the previous entry-level 2.6&nbsp;L engine.\n\nThe CTS was originally offered with either GM's in-house five-speed [[GM 5L40-E transmission|5L40-E]] [[automatic transmission]] or a five-speed [[Getrag]] [[Getrag 260 transmission|260]] [[manual transmission]]. For the 2005 model year, the Getrag was replaced with an [[Aisin]] [[Aisin AY transmission|AY-6]] six-speed.\n\nIn 2004, GM introduced the CTS-V, a high performance version of the CTS intended to compete with luxury performance sedans like the BMW M3/M5, Audi S4/S6, and Mercedes-Benz C and E-class AMGs. The 2004 and 2005 CTS-Vs were equipped with the 5.7L LS6 V-8 ({{convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm, {{convert|395|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,800&nbsp;rpm), a Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission, 14+\" rotors and Brembo 4-piston calipers front and rear, suspension upgrades (higher spring rates, stiffer anti-roll bars, two available damper packages), and subtle exterior changes. As the LS6 was phased out, the 2006 and 2007 CTS-Vs received the 6.0L LS2 V-8, which carried the same HP and torque ratings (with peak torque coming 400 rpm sooner).\n\nA prototype first generation CTS station wagon was made but it was never put into production.\n\n<div  style=\"text-align:center; text-align:left;\">\n<gallery>\nFile:Cadillac CTS 002.JPG|Japanese CTS\nFile:CTS interior.jpg|Interior\nFile:Cadillac CTS China 2016-04-07.jpg|Chinese CTS\n</gallery>\n</div>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Second generation (2008\u20132013) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Second generation\n| image        = 2010 Cadillac CTS sedan -- 10-30-2009.jpg\n| production   = 2007\u20132014\n| model_years  = 2008\u20132013 (sedan, 2014 for V only) <br> 2010\u20132014 (wagon) <br> 2011\u20132014 (coupe, 2015 for V only)\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list | United States: Lansing, Michigan (Lansing Grand River Assembly) | Russia: [[Kaliningrad]], Kaliningrad Oblast ([[Avtotor]])<ref name=\"avtotor.ru\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> }}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[coup\u00e9]] (2011\u20132014) | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (2008\u20132013) | 5-door [[station wagon]] (2010\u20132014) }}\n| layout       = {{unbulleted list | [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] | [[Front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, four-wheel drive]] }}\n| platform     = [[GM Sigma platform#Sigma II|GM Sigma II]]\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list |2.8 L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LP1|LP1]]'' V6 (gasoline)| 3.0 L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LF1|LF1]]'' V6 (gasoline)|3.0 L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LFW|LFW]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 3.6&nbsp;L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LY7|LY7]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 3.6&nbsp;L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LLT|LLT]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 3.6&nbsp;L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LFX|LFX]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 6.2 L ''[[LS based GM small-block engine#LSA|LSA]]'' V8 ([[supercharger|supercharged]] gasoline)}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list |6-speed ''[[GM 6L50 transmission|6L50]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]|6-speed ''[[GM 6L80 transmission|6L90]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] (CTS-V)|6-speed [[Aisin]] ''[[Aisin AY transmission|AY-6]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]]|6-speed [[Tremec]] ''[[Tremec TR-6060 transmission|6L95M]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]]}}\n| wheelbase    = {{Convert|113.4|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}\n| length       = {{Convert|191.6|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (2008\u20132011 sedan)<br /> {{Convert|191.3|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (2010\u201311 wagon)<br /> {{Convert|188.5|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (coupe)<br />{{Convert|192.0|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (2012\u2013present wagon)\n| width        = {{Convert|72.5|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (sedan)<br />{{Convert|72.6|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (wagon)<br />{{Convert|74.1|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (coupe)\n| height       = {{Convert|58|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (sedan)<br />{{Convert|59.1|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (wagon)<br />{{Convert|55.9|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (coupe)\n| weight        = {{Convert|3860|lbs|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (sedan)\n| designer     = {{unbulleted list | John Manoogian II (2004) | [[Eric Clough]] (2004) }}\n}}\n\nGM revealed the all-new 2008 CTS at the [[North American International Auto Show#2007|North American International Auto Show]] in January 2007.

The use of a V8 engine required a unique engine cradle distinct from the base CTS V6.  Larger anti-roll bars and larger shocks were also added.  The spring rate was significantly increased.  The 2006-2007 update also included a stronger rear differential and [[half shaft]] design. Unique front and rear treatments also included mesh grilles over the front openings, a track-ready suspension, and 18\u00d78.5&nbsp;inch wheels inside of P245/45R18 Z-rated [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] Eagle F1 Supercar [[run-flat tire]]s. Brakes were {{Convert|13.97|in|mm|abbr=on}} rotors in the front, with {{Convert|14.37|in|mm|abbr=on}} rotors in the rear - each with four-piston [[Brembo]] calipers on the front and rear wheels.  In addition, GM badges were added on 2006 models. For performance enthusiasts, a high performance suspension package (RPO FG2) was available as a dealer installed option.\n\n====Engine====\nThe [[Cadillac CTS|CTS sedan]] is enhanced with GM performance parts like a [[GM LS engine]] [[V8 engine|V8]] from the C5-generation [[Chevrolet Corvette]] Z06, as well as the Corvette Z06's six-speed [[Tremec]] [[manual transmission]] gear ratios. From 2004 and 2005, the CTS-V came with the 5.7&nbsp;L pushrod [[OHV]] [[GM LS6 engine|LS6]] engine producing {{Convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|395|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,800&nbsp;rpm. The {{convert|5|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque reduction of the CTS-V vs the LS6 used in the C5 Z06, was due to the exhaust manifold that needed to be used on the CTS-V.  From 2006 to 2007, the previous [[GM LS6 engine|LS6]] engine was superseded by the new 6.0&nbsp;L OHV [[GM LS2 engine|LS2]] [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] as used in the base 2005 [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. The new LS2 engine was rated at the same {{Convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm with the peak torque of {{convert|395|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,400&nbsp;rpm.  While both engines offer the same HP and torque specifications, the LS2's benefit was a wider torque band, due to the  higher displacement it offered.\n\n====Transmission====\nThe only available transmission was the six-speed manual [[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission|Tremec T56]].  The transmission used the [[skip-shift]] feature to conserve fuel during light loads by preventing drivers from using the second and third gears, and a dual mass flywheel to reduce \"rattle\" in no load conditions.  The rear axle was a Getrag limited slip IRS unit with a 3.73:1 ratio.\n\n====Performance====\nGeneral Motors states a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of 4.6 seconds for the first generation CTS-V, with the quarter mile time estimated at 13.1 seconds at {{Convert|109|mph|0|abbr=on}}, onward to a stated top speed of {{Convert|163|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The 14 inch diameter Brembo brakes can slow the vehicle from 60&nbsp;mph in 110 feet. The first generation CTS-V also posted a lap time of 8 minutes 19 seconds at Germany's famed N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife, competitive with rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG, BMW M5, and Lexus IS-F.\n\n=== Second generation (2008\u20132014)===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Second generation\n| image        = Cadillac CTS-V 2 -- 08-25-2009.jpg\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| production   = 2008-2014\n| model_years  = 2009-2014 (sedan) <br> 2011-2014 (wagon) <br> 2011-2015 (Coupe)\n| assembly     =[[Lansing Grand River Assembly]] in [[Lansing, Michigan]], United States\n| designer=\n| class        = \n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[coup\u00e9]] | 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] | 5-door [[station wagon]] }}\n| layout       = [[FR layout]]<ref>{{cite web |year=2011 |title=2011 CTS V Coupe Specs and Features |url=http://www.cadillac.com/ctsVCoupe/2011/features-specs/ |website=Cadillac |publisher=General Motors |accessdate=May 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511103038/http://www.cadillac.com/ctsVCoupe/2011/features-specs/# |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| platform     = [[GM Sigma platform#Sigma II|GM Sigma II]]\n| related      = [[Cadillac CTS]]\n| engine       = 6.2 L ''[[LS based GM small-block engine#LSA|LSA]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Supercharger|supercharged]] (gasoline)\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 6-speed ''[[GM 6L80 transmission|GM 6L90]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]| | 6-speed [[Tremec]] ''[[Tremec TR-6060 transmission|TR-6060]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]]}} \n| wheelbase    = {{convert|113.4|in|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length       = {{convert|191.6|in|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width        = {{convert|72.5|in|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height       = {{convert|58|in|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| sp           = us\n}}\n\n====Chassis====\nThe second generation CTS-V is based on the new [[GM Sigma platform|GM Sigma II platform]].

Historically, it was priced similar to cars on the [[Compact executive car|compact luxury]] spectrum; but it has always been sized closely to its mid-size rivals. The third generation competes directly with the mid-size luxury cars. Initially available only as a 4-door sedan on the [[GM Sigma platform]], GM had offered the second generation CTS in three body styles: 4-door sedan, 2-door coupe, and 5-door sport wagon also using the Sigma platform \u2014 and the third generation was offered only as a sedan, using a stretched version of the [[GM Alpha platform]].\n\nThe third-generation CTS's indirect successor is the smaller CT5, which, like the first- and second-generation CTS, takes on the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz C-Class, while maintaining its 5 Series/E-Class size.\n\n[[Wayne Cherry]] and Kip Wasenko designed the exterior of the first generation CTS, marking the production debut of a [[design language]] (marketed as \"Art and Science\") first seen on the [[Cadillac Evoq|Evoq]] concept car. Bob Boniface and Robin Krieg designed the exterior of the third generation CTS.\n\n== First generation (2003\u20132007) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = First generation\n| image        = Cadillac-CTS.jpg\n| production   =2002\u2013June 2007\n| model_years  = 2003\u20132007\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list | United States: [[Lansing, Michigan]] ([[Lansing Grand River Assembly]]) | [[People's Republic of China|China]]: [[Shanghai]] ([[Shanghai GM]])<br/>[[Republic of China|Taiwan]]: [[Miaoli City|Miaoli]] | Russia: [[Kaliningrad]], [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] ([[Avtotor]])<ref name=\"avtotor.ru\">{{cite web|url=http://www.avtotor.ru/gm/ |title=\u0413\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043f\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440 :: \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u0438 GM |language=Russian |publisher=Avtotor.ru |date= |accessdate=November 19, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160210120547/http://www.avtotor.ru/gm/ |archivedate=February 10, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|title=GM2009|url=http://www.avtotor.ru/upload/pictures/gm2009.jpg |accessdate=May 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904192557/http://www.avtotor.ru/upload/pictures/gm2009.jpg |archivedate=September 4, 2011 }}</ref> }}\n| designer     = {{unbulleted list | [[Wayne Cherry]] (1998) | Kip Wasenko (1998) }}\n| body_style   = 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n| platform     = [[GM Sigma platform]]\n| layout       = [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]]\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list | 2.6&nbsp;L ''[[General Motors 54\u00b0 V6 engine#2.6|LY9]]'' [[V6]] ([[gasoline]]) | 2.8&nbsp;L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LP1|LP1]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 3.2&nbsp;L ''[[General Motors 54\u00b0 V6 engine#LA3|LA3]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 3.6&nbsp;L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LY7|LY7]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 5.7&nbsp;L ''[[LS based GM small-block engine#LS6|LS6]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] (gasoline) | 6.0&nbsp;L ''[[LS based GM small-block engine#LS2|LS2]]'' V8 (gasoline) }}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 5-speed ''[[GM 5L40-E transmission#5L40-E|5L40-E]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] | 5-speed [[Getrag]] ''[[Getrag 260 transmission|260]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]] | 6-speed [[Aisin]] ''[[Aisin AY transmission|AY-6]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]] | 6-speed [[Tremec]] ''[[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission|T-56]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]] }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|113.4|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|190.1|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"newbury2002\">{{cite book |last=Newbury |first=Stephen |title=The Car Design Yearbook 1 |year=2002 |publisher=Merrell Publishers Limited |isbn=1-85894-190-3}}</ref>\n| width        = {{convert|70.6|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|56.7|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight       = {{convert|3568|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nIntroduced in early 2002 as a 2003 model, the CTS sedan was built on GM's new [[rear-wheel drive]] [[GM Sigma platform|Sigma platform]] and sported a fully independent suspension.

The 3.2&nbsp;L engine went out of production in 2005, when a new 2.8&nbsp;L version of the [[DOHC]] V6 debuted in an entry-level version of the CTS. In Europe, the 2.8&nbsp;L replaced the previous entry-level 2.6&nbsp;L engine.\n\nThe CTS was originally offered with either GM's in-house five-speed [[GM 5L40-E transmission|5L40-E]] [[automatic transmission]] or a five-speed [[Getrag]] [[Getrag 260 transmission|260]] [[manual transmission]]. For the 2005 model year, the Getrag was replaced with an [[Aisin]] [[Aisin AY transmission|AY-6]] six-speed.\n\nIn 2004, GM introduced the CTS-V, a high performance version of the CTS intended to compete with luxury performance sedans like the BMW M3/M5, Audi S4/S6, and Mercedes-Benz C and E-class AMGs. The 2004 and 2005 CTS-Vs were equipped with the 5.7L LS6 V-8 ({{convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm, {{convert|395|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,800&nbsp;rpm), a Tremec T56 6-speed manual transmission, 14+\" rotors and Brembo 4-piston calipers front and rear, suspension upgrades (higher spring rates, stiffer anti-roll bars, two available damper packages), and subtle exterior changes. As the LS6 was phased out, the 2006 and 2007 CTS-Vs received the 6.0L LS2 V-8, which carried the same HP and torque ratings (with peak torque coming 400 rpm sooner).\n\nA prototype first generation CTS station wagon was made but it was never put into production.\n\n<div  style=\"text-align:center; text-align:left;\">\n<gallery>\nFile:Cadillac CTS 002.JPG|Japanese CTS\nFile:CTS interior.jpg|Interior\nFile:Cadillac CTS China 2016-04-07.jpg|Chinese CTS\n</gallery>\n</div>\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Second generation (2008\u20132013) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Second generation\n| image        = 2010 Cadillac CTS sedan -- 10-30-2009.jpg\n| production   = 2007\u20132014\n| model_years  = 2008\u20132013 (sedan, 2014 for V only) <br> 2010\u20132014 (wagon) <br> 2011\u20132014 (coupe, 2015 for V only)\n| assembly     = {{unbulleted list | United States: Lansing, Michigan (Lansing Grand River Assembly) | Russia: [[Kaliningrad]], Kaliningrad Oblast ([[Avtotor]])<ref name=\"avtotor.ru\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> }}\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[coup\u00e9]] (2011\u20132014) | 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (2008\u20132013) | 5-door [[station wagon]] (2010\u20132014) }}\n| layout       = {{unbulleted list | [[Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, rear-wheel drive]] | [[Front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout|Front-engine, four-wheel drive]] }}\n| platform     = [[GM Sigma platform#Sigma II|GM Sigma II]]\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list |2.8 L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LP1|LP1]]'' V6 (gasoline)| 3.0 L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LF1|LF1]]'' V6 (gasoline)|3.0 L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LFW|LFW]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 3.6&nbsp;L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LY7|LY7]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 3.6&nbsp;L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LLT|LLT]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 3.6&nbsp;L ''[[GM High Feature engine#LFX|LFX]]'' V6 (gasoline) | 6.2 L ''[[LS based GM small-block engine#LSA|LSA]]'' V8 ([[supercharger|supercharged]] gasoline)}}\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list |6-speed ''[[GM 6L50 transmission|6L50]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]|6-speed ''[[GM 6L80 transmission|6L90]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]] (CTS-V)|6-speed [[Aisin]] ''[[Aisin AY transmission|AY-6]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]]|6-speed [[Tremec]] ''[[Tremec TR-6060 transmission|6L95M]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]]}}\n| wheelbase    = {{Convert|113.4|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}}\n| length       = {{Convert|191.6|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (2008\u20132011 sedan)<br /> {{Convert|191.3|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (2010\u201311 wagon)<br /> {{Convert|188.5|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (coupe)<br />{{Convert|192.0|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (2012\u2013present wagon)\n| width        = {{Convert|72.5|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (sedan)<br />{{Convert|72.6|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (wagon)<br />{{Convert|74.1|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (coupe)\n| height       = {{Convert|58|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (sedan)<br />{{Convert|59.1|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (wagon)<br />{{Convert|55.9|in|mm|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (coupe)\n| weight        = {{Convert|3860|lbs|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} (sedan)\n| designer     = {{unbulleted list | John Manoogian II (2004) | [[Eric Clough]] (2004) }}\n}}\n\nGM revealed the all-new 2008 CTS at the [[North American International Auto Show#2007|North American International Auto Show]] in January 2007.

The use of a V8 engine required a unique engine cradle distinct from the base CTS V6.  Larger anti-roll bars and larger shocks were also added.  The spring rate was significantly increased.  The 2006-2007 update also included a stronger rear differential and [[half shaft]] design. Unique front and rear treatments also included mesh grilles over the front openings, a track-ready suspension, and 18\u00d78.5&nbsp;inch wheels inside of P245/45R18 Z-rated [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] Eagle F1 Supercar [[run-flat tire]]s. Brakes were {{Convert|13.97|in|mm|abbr=on}} rotors in the front, with {{Convert|14.37|in|mm|abbr=on}} rotors in the rear - each with four-piston [[Brembo]] calipers on the front and rear wheels.  In addition, GM badges were added on 2006 models. For performance enthusiasts, a high performance suspension package (RPO FG2) was available as a dealer installed option.\n\n====Engine====\nThe [[Cadillac CTS|CTS sedan]] is enhanced with GM performance parts like a [[GM LS engine]] [[V8 engine|V8]] from the C5-generation [[Chevrolet Corvette]] Z06, as well as the Corvette Z06's six-speed [[Tremec]] [[manual transmission]] gear ratios. From 2004 and 2005, the CTS-V came with the 5.7&nbsp;L pushrod [[OHV]] [[GM LS6 engine|LS6]] engine producing {{Convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|395|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,800&nbsp;rpm. The {{convert|5|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} torque reduction of the CTS-V vs the LS6 used in the C5 Z06, was due to the exhaust manifold that needed to be used on the CTS-V.  From 2006 to 2007, the previous [[GM LS6 engine|LS6]] engine was superseded by the new 6.0&nbsp;L OHV [[GM LS2 engine|LS2]] [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] as used in the base 2005 [[Chevrolet Corvette]]. The new LS2 engine was rated at the same {{Convert|400|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000&nbsp;rpm with the peak torque of {{convert|395|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 4,400&nbsp;rpm.  While both engines offer the same HP and torque specifications, the LS2's benefit was a wider torque band, due to the  higher displacement it offered.\n\n====Transmission====\nThe only available transmission was the six-speed manual [[Borg-Warner T-56 transmission|Tremec T56]].  The transmission used the [[skip-shift]] feature to conserve fuel during light loads by preventing drivers from using the second and third gears, and a dual mass flywheel to reduce \"rattle\" in no load conditions.  The rear axle was a Getrag limited slip IRS unit with a 3.73:1 ratio.\n\n====Performance====\nGeneral Motors states a 0-60&nbsp;mph time of 4.6 seconds for the first generation CTS-V, with the quarter mile time estimated at 13.1 seconds at {{Convert|109|mph|0|abbr=on}}, onward to a stated top speed of {{Convert|163|mph|0|abbr=on}}. The 14 inch diameter Brembo brakes can slow the vehicle from 60&nbsp;mph in 110 feet. The first generation CTS-V also posted a lap time of 8 minutes 19 seconds at Germany's famed N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife, competitive with rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG, BMW M5, and Lexus IS-F.\n\n=== Second generation (2008\u20132014)===\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = Second generation\n| image        = Cadillac CTS-V 2 -- 08-25-2009.jpg\n| manufacturer = [[General Motors]]\n| production   = 2008-2014\n| model_years  = 2009-2014 (sedan) <br> 2011-2014 (wagon) <br> 2011-2015 (Coupe)\n| assembly     =[[Lansing Grand River Assembly]] in [[Lansing, Michigan]], United States\n| designer=\n| class        = \n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list | 2-door [[coup\u00e9]] | 4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] | 5-door [[station wagon]] }}\n| layout       = [[FR layout]]<ref>{{cite web |year=2011 |title=2011 CTS V Coupe Specs and Features |url=http://www.cadillac.com/ctsVCoupe/2011/features-specs/ |website=Cadillac |publisher=General Motors |accessdate=May 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511103038/http://www.cadillac.com/ctsVCoupe/2011/features-specs/# |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n| platform     = [[GM Sigma platform#Sigma II|GM Sigma II]]\n| related      = [[Cadillac CTS]]\n| engine       = 6.2 L ''[[LS based GM small-block engine#LSA|LSA]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]] [[Supercharger|supercharged]] (gasoline)\n| transmission = {{unbulleted list | 6-speed ''[[GM 6L80 transmission|GM 6L90]]'' [[automatic transmission|automatic]]| | 6-speed [[Tremec]] ''[[Tremec TR-6060 transmission|TR-6060]]'' [[manual transmission|manual]]}} \n| wheelbase    = {{convert|113.4|in|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| length       = {{convert|191.6|in|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| width        = {{convert|72.5|in|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| height       = {{convert|58|in|mm|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| weight       = {{convert|4250|lb|kg|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}\n| sp           = us\n}}\n\n====Chassis====\nThe second generation CTS-V is based on the new [[GM Sigma platform|GM Sigma II platform]].
