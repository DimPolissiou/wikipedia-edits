Paul Bradshaw ''Essays on Early Eastern Eucharistic Prayers,'' {{ISBN|081466153X}} (1997) pp. 19-37</ref>\n\n==Catholic Church's position==\nWhile the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox|Oriental]] Orthodox Churches generally deny even the validity of the [[apostolic succession]] of the [[Church of the East]], and thus the validity of its priesthood, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] has always recognized its validity. Still some Catholics questioned the validity of the consecration in the absence of the Words of Institution because the [[Council of Florence]] had declared that the words (in Catholic theology, the \"form\") of the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]] are \"the words of the [[Jesus Christ|Saviour]] with which he effected this sacrament\",<ref>Council of Florence, Decr. 4 Sep 1439, Denzinger 1321</ref> words that the same council indicated as \"This is my body\" and \"This is the chalice of my blood\".<ref>Council of Florence, Decr. 4 Febr 1442, Denzinger 1352</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the Catholic Church never officially contested the validity of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari. In the closing decades of the 20th century, ecumenical rapprochement with the Assyrian Church of the East and the situation of the by then widely scattered Assyrian and Chaldean Christians who lacked a priest of their own Church made more acute the issue of the validity of the Eucharistic consecration of the form of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari that did not include the Words of Institution, as used by the Assyrian Christians, while the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] that use the East Syriac Rite include in their versions of this liturgy the Institution narrative, with its [[Words of Institution]]. Accordingly, on 20 July 2001 the [[Holy See]]<ref>Concretely, the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] in agreement with the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] and the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]].</ref> declared that the Anaphora of Addai and Mari can be considered valid. Three reasons were given for this judgment. First, the Anaphora of Addai and Mari dates back to the [[early Church]]. Secondly, the [[Church of the East]] has otherwise preserved the orthodox faith in regard to the [[Eucharist]] and [[Holy Orders]]. And finally, though the Words of Institution are not spoken expressly, their meaning is present: \"The words of Eucharistic Institution are indeed present in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, not in a coherent narrative way and ''ad litteram'', but rather in a dispersed euchological way, that is, integrated in successive prayers of thanksgiving, praise and intercession\".<ref name=\"Guidelines\">[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_20011025_chiesa-caldea-assira_en.html Guidelines issued by the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]</ref>\n\n===Guidelines for admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Church and the Assyrian Church of the East===\nCatholic [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] excludes participation by Catholics in the Eucharistic services of Christian communities whose services it considers invalid and permits participation by members of such communities in the Catholic Eucharist only in very exceptional circumstances and only if the individual members in question hold the same belief as the Catholic Church concerning the Eucharist;<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html#TITULUS_XVI Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 671 \u00a74] and cf.

[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844 \u00a7\u00a72-3]</ref> Accordingly, the 20 July 2001 document of the [[Holy See]], titled ''Guidelines for admission to the Eucharist between the [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Church]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]'',<ref name=\"Guidelines\"/> drew the following conclusions from the recognition of the validity of the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari as celebrated in the Assyrian Church of the East:\n# Assyrian faithful are permitted, when necessary, to participate and to receive Holy Communion in a Chaldean celebration of the Holy Eucharist.\n# Chaldean faithful unable to approach a Catholic minister are permitted to participate and to receive Holy Communion in an Assyrian celebration of the Holy Eucharist, even if celebrated using the Anaphora of Addai and Mari in its form without the Words of Institution.\n# Assyrian ministers are warmly invited (but not obliged) to insert the Words of Institution in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari when Chaldean faithful are present at the liturgy.\n\nThe provisions above are thus intended for occasions when it is not possible for Assyrian or Chaldean faithful to attend their own Church. They are not a declaration of [[full communion]] between the two Churches, although the document recognizes that the [[Common Christological Declaration Between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East|joint declaration]] signed by [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Patriarch Dinkha IV of the Assyrian Church of the East]] has solved the main dogmatic problem between the two Churches and that on 29 November 1996 the Assyrian and Chaldean patriarchs had agreed to a list of common proposals aimed at re-establishing full communion.\n\nUnlike the Catholic Church, the Assyrian Church of the East has an [[Open Communion]] practice, allowing any baptized Christian to receive its Eucharist.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.churchoftheeastflint.org/index.html |title=see for example |access-date=11 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627024036/http://www.churchoftheeastflint.org/index.html |archive-date=27 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDialogue between the two Churches later slowed down and was suspended in 2002.\n\n===Traditionalist Catholic reaction===\nSome [[traditionalist Catholic]]s {{which?|date=August 2015}} denounced recognition of the form of the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari in use in the Assyrian Church as valid.

Paul Bradshaw ''Essays on Early Eastern Eucharistic Prayers,'' {{ISBN|081466153X}} (1997) pp. 19-37</ref>\n\n==Catholic Church's position==\nWhile the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox|Oriental]] Orthodox Churches generally deny even the validity of the [[apostolic succession]] of the [[Church of the East]], and thus the validity of its priesthood, the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] has always recognized its validity. Still some Catholics questioned the validity of the consecration in the absence of the Words of Institution because the [[Council of Florence]] had declared that the words (in Catholic theology, the \"form\") of the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]] are \"the words of the [[Jesus Christ|Saviour]] with which he effected this sacrament\",<ref>Council of Florence, Decr. 4 Sep 1439, Denzinger 1321</ref> words that the same council indicated as \"This is my body\" and \"This is the chalice of my blood\".<ref>Council of Florence, Decr. 4 Febr 1442, Denzinger 1352</ref>\n\nNevertheless, the Catholic Church never officially contested the validity of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari. In the closing decades of the 20th century, ecumenical rapprochement with the Assyrian Church of the East and the situation of the by then widely scattered Assyrian and Chaldean Christians who lacked a priest of their own Church made more acute the issue of the validity of the Eucharistic consecration of the form of the Anaphora of Addai and Mari that did not include the Words of Institution, as used by the Assyrian Christians, while the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] that use the East Syriac Rite include in their versions of this liturgy the Institution narrative, with its [[Words of Institution]]. Accordingly, on 20 July 2001 the [[Holy See]]<ref>Concretely, the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] in agreement with the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] and the [[Congregation for the Oriental Churches]].</ref> declared that the Anaphora of Addai and Mari can be considered valid. Three reasons were given for this judgment. First, the Anaphora of Addai and Mari dates back to the [[early Church]]. Secondly, the [[Church of the East]] has otherwise preserved the orthodox faith in regard to the [[Eucharist]] and [[Holy Orders]]. And finally, though the Words of Institution are not spoken expressly, their meaning is present: \"The words of Eucharistic Institution are indeed present in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, not in a coherent narrative way and ''ad litteram'', but rather in a dispersed euchological way, that is, integrated in successive prayers of thanksgiving, praise and intercession\".<ref name=\"Guidelines\">[https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/documents/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_20011025_chiesa-caldea-assira_en.html Guidelines issued by the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]</ref>\n\n===Guidelines for admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Church and the Assyrian Church of the East===\nCatholic [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] excludes participation by Catholics in the Eucharistic services of Christian communities whose services it considers invalid and permits participation by members of such communities in the Catholic Eucharist only in very exceptional circumstances and only if the individual members in question hold the same belief as the Catholic Church concerning the Eucharist;<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_19901018_codex-can-eccl-orient-2_lt.html#TITULUS_XVI Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, canon 671 \u00a74] and cf.

[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2S.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 844 \u00a7\u00a72-3]</ref> Accordingly, the 20 July 2001 document of the [[Holy See]], titled ''Guidelines for admission to the Eucharist between the [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean Church]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]'',<ref name=\"Guidelines\"/> drew the following conclusions from the recognition of the validity of the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari as celebrated in the Assyrian Church of the East:\n# Assyrian faithful are permitted, when necessary, to participate and to receive Holy Communion in a Chaldean celebration of the Holy Eucharist.\n# Chaldean faithful unable to approach a Catholic minister are permitted to participate and to receive Holy Communion in an Assyrian celebration of the Holy Eucharist, even if celebrated using the Anaphora of Addai and Mari in its form without the Words of Institution.\n# Assyrian ministers are warmly invited (but not obliged) to insert the Words of Institution in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari when Chaldean faithful are present at the liturgy.\n\nThe provisions above are thus intended for occasions when it is not possible for Assyrian or Chaldean faithful to attend their own Church. They are not a declaration of [[full communion]] between the two Churches, although the document recognizes that the [[Common Christological Declaration Between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East|joint declaration]] signed by [[Pope John Paul II]] and [[Patriarch Dinkha IV of the Assyrian Church of the East]] has solved the main dogmatic problem between the two Churches and that on 29 November 1996 the Assyrian and Chaldean patriarchs had agreed to a list of common proposals aimed at re-establishing full communion.\n\nUnlike the Catholic Church, the Assyrian Church of the East has an [[Open Communion]] practice, allowing any baptized Christian to receive its Eucharist.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.churchoftheeastflint.org/index.html |title=see for example |access-date=11 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110627024036/http://www.churchoftheeastflint.org/index.html |archive-date=27 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDialogue between the two Churches later slowed down and was suspended in 2002.\n\n===Traditionalist Catholic reaction===\nSome [[traditionalist Catholic]]s {{which?|date=August 2015}} denounced recognition of the form of the Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari in use in the Assyrian Church as valid.

The [[libretto]], written by [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Chester Kallman]], is based loosely on the eight paintings and engravings ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' (1733\u20131735) of [[William Hogarth]], which Stravinsky had seen on 2 May 1947, in a Chicago exhibition.\n\nThe story concerns the decline and fall of one Tom Rakewell, who deserts Anne Trulove for the delights of London in the company of Nick Shadow, who turns out to be the [[Devil]]. After several misadventures, all initiated by the devious Shadow, Tom ends up in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], a hospital for the insane at that time situated in the City of London. The moral of the tale is: \"For idle hearts and hands and minds the Devil finds work to do.\"\n\n==Performance history==\nIt was first performed at the [[Teatro La Fenice]] in Venice on 11 September 1951, with [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]] creating the role of Anne Trulove, and [[Robert Rounseville]] that of Tom Rakewell. It was first given in Paris at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]] on 18 June 1952, under the baton of [[Andr\u00e9 Cluytens]] and produced by [[Louis Musy]].\n\nThe American premiere was on 14 February 1953, at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York, conducted by [[Fritz Reiner]] and produced by [[George Balanchine]]. Although the BBC had previously produced a studio recording (broadcast on 2 January 1953), and the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne Opera]] mounted a staged production at the King's Theatre in Edinburgh in August 1953, the first staging in England was by the Cambridge University Opera Group, and opened on 19 December 1956.\n\nIn 1957, it was a part of the first season of the [[Santa Fe Opera]] under the direction of [[John Crosby (conductor)|John Crosby]], who persuaded the composer to attend rehearsals. Stravinsky returned to the SFO each summer through 1963. In 1961, [[Ingmar Bergman]] produced the opera at the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] in Stockholm, where it opened on 22 April. The noteworthy 1975 [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] production was directed by [[John Cox (director)|John Cox]], used sets and costumes were designed by [[David Hockney]], and starred [[Leo Goeke]] as Tom Rakewell.\n\nIn 2010 the Berlin Staatsoper debuted [[Krzysztof Warlikowski]]'s production of The Rake's Progress, which transported the action from England to America and set it in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhFxDJyDnWI|title=THE RAKE'S PROGRESS \u2013 Oper von Igor Strawinsky &#124; Staatsoper Berlin|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> The production was full of references to American culture, such as Andy Warhol.\n\nin 2015, the [[Utah Opera]] produced the opera with the costumes and set designed by [[David Hockney]], first seen at Glyndebourne in 1975. Utah Symphony music director Thierry Fischer conducted, with stage direction by Roy Rallo, who assisted John Cox during [[San Francisco Opera|San Francisco Opera's]] 2000 revival.<ref>[https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/8/Reviews/SALT_LAKE_CITY__The_Rake\u2019s_Progress.html The Rake's Progress / Salt Lake City / Utah Opera] ''[[Opera News]]'', 5 May 2019, retrieved May 9, 2019</ref>\n\nAlso, in 2015, [[Portland Opera]] presented the David Hockney production.

Trulove has doubts about his daughter's proposed marriage and tries to arrange a regular job for Tom; but Tom resists the idea and, left on his own, declares his intention to \"live by my wits and trust to my luck.\" When Tom expresses his wish for money, Nick Shadow appears and tells him that an unknown uncle has left him a substantial fortune. He then invites Tom to employ him as a servant and accompany Tom to London to sort out the inheritance. The second scene, set in Mother Goose's brothel, shows Shadow introducing his new master to the sleazy aspects of London life. But Tom is uneasy and laments his betrayal of love, yet accepts Mother Goose's invitation to spend the night with her. Meanwhile, back in the country, Anne wonders why she has not heard from Tom. She knows somehow that he is in danger, and sets out for London to aid him.\n\n===Act 2===\nTom is bored with his dissolute life. He utters his second crucial wish, for happiness, whereupon Nick makes the odd suggestion that he demonstrate his freedom by marrying Baba the Turk, the famous [[bearded lady]]. Soon afterwards Anne finds Tom's London house, only to see him emerge from a sedan chair which also contains Baba, whom he has just married. Tom tells Anne to leave, yet genuinely regrets what has happened. In the next scene Tom is clearly finding his eccentric marriage intolerable, as Baba is a chatterbox with a fiery temper. He silences her by throwing his wig over her face, then falls asleep. Nick enters with a \"fantastic Baroque Machine\" and demonstrates how, through the use of a hidden compartment in the machine, it appears to turn stones into bread. Tom cries out in his sleep that he wishes it were true, and waking, finds the machine he has dreamt of. Nick hints that if such machines were mass-produced Tom could become a saviour of mankind and Tom sets out to market the machine, not knowing it is a sham.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:William Hogarth 019.jpg|thumb|Tom in Bedlam, comforted only by Sarah Young (Anne in the opera) \u2013 the last of Hogarth's paintings.]]\nThe plan has failed \u2013 the act starts with the auction of the ruined Tom's property by the maniac auctioneer Sellem. The objects for sale include Baba, who has remained immobile since being silenced by the wig. When unwrapped, she resumes her tantrum, now directed at the auction-goers for disturbing her belongings, but calms down when Anne enters. Baba advises her to find Tom and \"set him right\", and warns her against Nick Shadow. She announces her intent to return to her life on the stage. In a graveyard, Nick reveals his identity and demands payment from Tom, in the form of his soul; but as midnight strikes, Nick offers him an escape in the form of a game of cards, which Tom wins, thanks to the benign influence of Anne. Defeated, Nick sinks into the ground, condemning Tom to insanity as he goes. Consigned to Bedlam, Tom believes he is Adonis. Anne (\"Venus\") visits him, sings him to sleep, then quietly leaves him. When he realises she has gone, he dies.\n\nIn an epilogue, each of the principal characters gives a moral drawn from their scenes in the opera, and then come together to ascribe a final joint moral, \"for idle hands, and hearts and minds, the Devil finds a work to do.\"\n\n== Noted arias ==\n* Shadow's Aria (\"Come, master, observe the host of mankind.\")\n* Shadow's Departure (\"I burn! I freeze!\")\n* Anne's Aria (\"No word from Tom.\")\n* Tom Rakewell's Aria (\"Here I stand...\")\n* Tom Rakewell's 2nd Aria (\u201cLove Too Frequently Betrayed\u201d)\n* Tom Rakewell's 3rd Aria (\u201cVary the Song\u201d)\n* Baba the Turk's Aria and Monologue (\"As I was saying, both brothers wore moustaches...\")\n* Anne's Lullaby (\"Gently, little boat\")\n\n== Quotes ==\nShadow (goading Tom into further ridiculous behaviour): \n:''No eye his future can foretell''\n:''No law his past explain''\n:''Whom neither Passion may compel''\n:''Nor Reason can restrain''.\n\n==Recordings==\nThere have been more than half a dozen recordings of the opera. The Gala recording of the 1951 live performance is available. A Sony recording, with [[Judith Raskin]] as Ann and [[John Reardon (baritone)|John Reardon]] as Nick Shadow, is from London 1964 and is conducted by Stravinsky himself.

The [[libretto]], written by [[W. H. Auden]] and [[Chester Kallman]], is based loosely on the eight paintings and engravings ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' (1733\u20131735) of [[William Hogarth]], which Stravinsky had seen on 2 May 1947, in a Chicago exhibition.\n\nThe story concerns the decline and fall of one Tom Rakewell, who deserts Anne Trulove for the delights of London in the company of Nick Shadow, who turns out to be the [[Devil]]. After several misadventures, all initiated by the devious Shadow, Tom ends up in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], a hospital for the insane at that time situated in the City of London. The moral of the tale is: \"For idle hearts and hands and minds the Devil finds work to do.\"\n\n==Performance history==\nIt was first performed at the [[Teatro La Fenice]] in Venice on 11 September 1951, with [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]] creating the role of Anne Trulove, and [[Robert Rounseville]] that of Tom Rakewell. It was first given in Paris at the [[Op\u00e9ra-Comique]] on 18 June 1952, under the baton of [[Andr\u00e9 Cluytens]] and produced by [[Louis Musy]].\n\nThe American premiere was on 14 February 1953, at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York, conducted by [[Fritz Reiner]] and produced by [[George Balanchine]]. Although the BBC had previously produced a studio recording (broadcast on 2 January 1953), and the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne Opera]] mounted a staged production at the King's Theatre in Edinburgh in August 1953, the first staging in England was by the Cambridge University Opera Group, and opened on 19 December 1956.\n\nIn 1957, it was a part of the first season of the [[Santa Fe Opera]] under the direction of [[John Crosby (conductor)|John Crosby]], who persuaded the composer to attend rehearsals. Stravinsky returned to the SFO each summer through 1963. In 1961, [[Ingmar Bergman]] produced the opera at the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] in Stockholm, where it opened on 22 April. The noteworthy 1975 [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]] production was directed by [[John Cox (director)|John Cox]], used sets and costumes were designed by [[David Hockney]], and starred [[Leo Goeke]] as Tom Rakewell.\n\nIn 2010 the Berlin Staatsoper debuted [[Krzysztof Warlikowski]]'s production of The Rake's Progress, which transported the action from England to America and set it in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhFxDJyDnWI|title=THE RAKE'S PROGRESS \u2013 Oper von Igor Strawinsky &#124; Staatsoper Berlin|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> The production was full of references to American culture, such as Andy Warhol.\n\nin 2015, the [[Utah Opera]] produced the opera with the costumes and set designed by [[David Hockney]], first seen at Glyndebourne in 1975. Utah Symphony music director Thierry Fischer conducted, with stage direction by Roy Rallo, who assisted John Cox during [[San Francisco Opera|San Francisco Opera's]] 2000 revival.<ref>[https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/8/Reviews/SALT_LAKE_CITY__The_Rake\u2019s_Progress.html The Rake's Progress / Salt Lake City / Utah Opera] ''[[Opera News]]'', 5 May 2019, retrieved May 9, 2019</ref>\n\nAlso, in 2015, [[Portland Opera]] presented the David Hockney production.

Trulove has doubts about his daughter's proposed marriage and tries to arrange a regular job for Tom; but Tom resists the idea and, left on his own, declares his intention to \"live by my wits and trust to my luck.\" When Tom expresses his wish for money, Nick Shadow appears and tells him that an unknown uncle has left him a substantial fortune. He then invites Tom to employ him as a servant and accompany Tom to London to sort out the inheritance. The second scene, set in Mother Goose's brothel, shows Shadow introducing his new master to the sleazy aspects of London life. But Tom is uneasy and laments his betrayal of love, yet accepts Mother Goose's invitation to spend the night with her. Meanwhile, back in the country, Anne wonders why she has not heard from Tom. She knows somehow that he is in danger, and sets out for London to aid him.\n\n===Act 2===\nTom is bored with his dissolute life. He utters his second crucial wish, for happiness, whereupon Nick makes the odd suggestion that he demonstrate his freedom by marrying Baba the Turk, the famous [[bearded lady]]. Soon afterwards Anne finds Tom's London house, only to see him emerge from a sedan chair which also contains Baba, whom he has just married. Tom tells Anne to leave, yet genuinely regrets what has happened. In the next scene Tom is clearly finding his eccentric marriage intolerable, as Baba is a chatterbox with a fiery temper. He silences her by throwing his wig over her face, then falls asleep. Nick enters with a \"fantastic Baroque Machine\" and demonstrates how, through the use of a hidden compartment in the machine, it appears to turn stones into bread. Tom cries out in his sleep that he wishes it were true, and waking, finds the machine he has dreamt of. Nick hints that if such machines were mass-produced Tom could become a saviour of mankind and Tom sets out to market the machine, not knowing it is a sham.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:William Hogarth 019.jpg|thumb|Tom in Bedlam, comforted only by Sarah Young (Anne in the opera) \u2013 the last of Hogarth's paintings.]]\nThe plan has failed \u2013 the act starts with the auction of the ruined Tom's property by the maniac auctioneer Sellem. The objects for sale include Baba, who has remained immobile since being silenced by the wig. When unwrapped, she resumes her tantrum, now directed at the auction-goers for disturbing her belongings, but calms down when Anne enters. Baba advises her to find Tom and \"set him right\", and warns her against Nick Shadow. She announces her intent to return to her life on the stage. In a graveyard, Nick reveals his identity and demands payment from Tom, in the form of his soul; but as midnight strikes, Nick offers him an escape in the form of a game of cards, which Tom wins, thanks to the benign influence of Anne. Defeated, Nick sinks into the ground, condemning Tom to insanity as he goes. Consigned to Bedlam, Tom believes he is Adonis. Anne (\"Venus\") visits him, sings him to sleep, then quietly leaves him. When he realises she has gone, he dies.\n\nIn an epilogue, each of the principal characters gives a moral drawn from their scenes in the opera, and then come together to ascribe a final joint moral, \"for idle hands, and hearts and minds, the Devil finds a work to do.\"\n\n== Noted arias ==\n* Shadow's Aria (\"Come, master, observe the host of mankind.\")\n* Shadow's Departure (\"I burn! I freeze!\")\n* Anne's Aria (\"No word from Tom.\")\n* Tom Rakewell's Aria (\"Here I stand...\")\n* Tom Rakewell's 2nd Aria (\u201cLove Too Frequently Betrayed\u201d)\n* Tom Rakewell's 3rd Aria (\u201cVary the Song\u201d)\n* Baba the Turk's Aria and Monologue (\"As I was saying, both brothers wore moustaches...\")\n* Anne's Lullaby (\"Gently, little boat\")\n\n== Quotes ==\nShadow (goading Tom into further ridiculous behaviour): \n:''No eye his future can foretell''\n:''No law his past explain''\n:''Whom neither Passion may compel''\n:''Nor Reason can restrain''.\n\n==Recordings==\nThere have been more than half a dozen recordings of the opera. The Gala recording of the 1951 live performance is available. A Sony recording, with [[Judith Raskin]] as Ann and [[John Reardon (baritone)|John Reardon]] as Nick Shadow, is from London 1964 and is conducted by Stravinsky himself. It is currently available on the Sony/BMG 22-CD box set ''Works of Igor Stravinsky''.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Width=\"165\"|Cast<br>(Tom,Anne,Nick,Baba)\n!Conductor,<br>opera house and/or orchestra\n!Label\n|-\n|1953\n|[[Eugene Conley]],<br>[[Hilde Gueden]],<br>[[Mack Harrell]],<br>[[Blanche Thebom]]\n|[[Igor Stravinsky]],<br>[[Metropolitan Opera]] Chorus and Orchestra\n|CD: Naxos, <br>Catalogue No: 8.111266-67 <br>(Original recording issued by Columbia)\n|-\n|1964\n|[[Alexander Young (tenor)|Alexander Young]],<br>[[Judith Raskin]],<br>[[John Reardon (baritone)|John Reardon]],<br>[[Regina Sarfaty]]\n|[[Igor Stravinsky]],<br>[[Sadler's Wells Opera]] Chorus, <br>[[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]\n|CD: Sony (Original recording issued by Columbia)\n|-\n|1983\n|[[Philip Langridge]],<br>[[Cathryn Pope]],<br>[[Samuel Ramey]],<br>[[Sarah Walker (mezzo-soprano)|Sarah Walker]]\n|[[Riccardo Chailly]],<br>[[London Sinfonietta]] and Chorus\n|CD: DECCA\n|-\n|1993\n|[[Jon Garrison]],<br>[[Jayne West]],<br>John Cheek,<br>[[Wendy White (mezzo-soprano)|Wendy White]]\n|[[Robert Craft]],<br>Gregg Smith Singers,<br>[[Orchestra of St. Luke's]]\n|CD: Naxos,<br>Catalogue No: 8.660272-73, <br>(original recording issued by Musicmasters Classics)\n|-\n|1995\n|[[Jerry Hadley]],<br>[[Dawn Upshaw]],<br>[[Samuel Ramey]],<br>[[Grace Bumbry]]\n|[[Kent Nagano]],<br>[[Lyon Opera]] Orchestra and Chorus\n|CD: Erato<br>Cat.

The rulers of Kozhikode belonged to \"Nediyirippu swaroopam\" and followed matriliny system of inheritance. The eldest male member of Nediyirippu swaroopam became the Samoothiri of Kozhikode. There was a set pattern of succession, indicated by sthanams in the royal line. Five sthanams were defined in Kozhikode. These positions were based on the chronological seniority of the incumbent in the different thavazhis of the swaroopam and constituted what is called in the records as \"kuruvazhcha\". Unlike in the case of Cochin (Kochi), there was no rotation of position among the thavazhis. Thus no particular thavazhi enjoyed any privilege or precedence in the matter of succession, as the only criterion for succession was seniority of age.<ref name=VVHaridas />\n\nFive sthanams existed in Kozhikode, each with its own separate property enjoyed in succession by the senior members of the three kovilakams of the family.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\n# 1st sthanam: the Samoothiri of Kozhikode\n# 2nd sthanam: Eranadu Ilamkur Nambiyathiri Thirumulpadu (the Eralppadu).

However, during the partition of Chera kingdom, the Chera monarch failed to allocate any land to Nediyiruppu. Filled with guilt, the king later gave an unwanted piece of marshy tract of land called Kozhikode to the younger brother Vikraman (the elder brother died in the battle). The king also gifted his personal sword and his favourite prayer [[Shankha|conch]] \u2013 both broken \u2013 to him and told him to occupy as much as land as he could with all his might. So the Eradis conquered neighbouring kingdoms and created a large state for themselves.

The Cheraman sword was burnt in a surprise attack by the Dutch at Kodungallur (1670) while the Samoothiri was residing with Velutha Nambiyar. A new sword was made in 1672 out of the fragments of the old. The broken parts of the 1672 sword, kept in a fully sealed copper sheath, are still worshipped daily in the Bhagavathi temple attached to the palace of the Samoothiris at Thiruvachira.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rulers of Eranadu ===\nHistorical records regarding the origin of the Samoothiri of Kozhikode are obscure.

The office of the chief/senior prince of Eranadu (Eralanadu Utaya) is assumed to be the hereditary.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/><ref name=\"Narayanan\" /> The earliest reference to the chief and chiefdom of Eranadu is the Cochin Jewish copper plate (c. 1000 AD). Old Malayalam inscriptions name two titles for the rulers of Eranadu - Manvepala Manaviyata ( c. 11 century) and Manavikrama (c. 12th century). In the later period, Manavikrama, Manaveda and Viraraya were the only names given to male members in the royal family, the Samoothiri always being known as Manavikrama. Historians assume that Manaveda might be a corruption of the old Malayalam title \"Manaviyata\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Scholars tentatively identify Manaviyata and Manavikrama with the titles of the elder and younger brothers of the famous origin legend.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe strength of the \"Hundred Organisation\" of the senior prince of Eranadu was \"Six Hundred\". Hundred organisations with same capacity are also found in Ramavalanadu, Valluvanadu, Kizhmalanadu, and Venadu.

The Eradi seems to have led the Chera army to victory. The king therefore granted him, as a mark of favour, a small tract of land on the sea-coast [Kozhikode] in addition to his hereditary possessions [Eralanadu province].

The Eradi marched with his Nairs towards [[Panniyankara]] and besieged the Polarthiri at his base, resulting in a 48-year-long standoff. The Eradi was unsuccessful, and then he propitiated the [[Bhagavati]], bribed the followers of Polarthiri and even the consort of the ruler of Polanadu and won them to his side. Learning of this treachery Polarthiri fled from Kozhikode. The Eradi emerged victorious and shifted his seat from [[Nediyiruppu]] to Kozhikode - then also called \"Thrivikramapuram\". The Eradis built a fort (Koyil Kotta) at a place called \"Velapuram\" (port) to safeguard their new interests.<ref name=\":7\">Menon. A Sreedhara, \"A Survey of Kerala History\", DC Books, 2007 - Kerala (India)</ref><ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>''\n\nThe power balance in Kerala changed as Eralnadu rulers developed the port at Kozhikode. The Samoothiri became one of the most powerful chiefs in Kerala.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> In some of his military campaigns \u2013 such as that into Valluvanadu \u2013 the ruler received unambiguous assistance from the Muslim Middle Eastern sailors.<ref name=\"VVHaridas\" /> It seems that the Muslim judge of Kozhikode offered all help in \"money and material\" to the Samoothiri to strike at Thirunavaya.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nSmaller chiefdoms south of Kozhikode \u2013 Beypore, Chaliyam, Parappanadu and Tanur (Vettam) \u2013 soon had to submit and became their feudatories one by one. The rulers of Payyormala, [[Kurumbranad]]u, and other Nair chiefs on the suburbs of Kozhikode also acknowledged the supremacy of Kozhikode. There were battles between Kozhikode and Kurumbranadu for a coastal region called Payyanadu. Payyanadu was a part of Kurumbranadu in early times, and was eventually given as a \"royal gift\" to Kozhikode. Kozhikode easily overran the Kurumbranadu warriors in the battle and Kurumbranadu had to sue for peace by surrendering Valisseri.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n[[File:Treasure Boat Shipyard - stele pavilion - Calicut stele - P1080100.JPG|thumb|Modern replica of the stele installed at Kozhikode by [[Zheng He]].

Inscription specifically mentions the word \"Punturakkon\"]]\t\n\nThe ruler of Kozhikode next turned his attention to the valley of [[Bharathappuzha|Perar]]. Large parts of the valley was then ruled by Valluvakkonathiri, the ancient hereditary chief of Valluvanadu. The principal objective of Kozhikode was the capture the sacred settlement of [[Tirunavaya|Thirunavaya]]. Soon the Samoothiris found themselves intervened in the so-called ''kurmatsaram'' between Nambudiris of Panniyurkur and Chovvarakur. In the most recent event, the Nambudiris from Thirumanasseri Nadu had assaulted and burned the nearby rival village. The rulers of Valluvanadu and [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]] came to help the Chovvaram and raided Panniyur simultaneously. Thirumanasseri Nadu was overran by its neighbours on south and east. The Thirumanasseri Nambudiri appealed to the ruler of Kozhikode for help, and promised to cede the port of [[Ponnani]] to Kozhikode as the price for his protection. Kozhikode, looking for such an opportunity, gladly accepted the offer.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nAssisted by the warriors of their subordinate chiefs (Chaliyam, [[Beypore]], [[Kingdom of Tanur|Tanur]] and [[Cranganore|Kodungallur]]) and the Muslim naval fleet under the Koya of Kozhikode, the Samoothiri's fighters advanced by both land and sea.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> The main force under the command of Samoothiri himself attacked, encamping at Thripangodu, an allied force of Valluvanadu and Perumpadappu from the north. Meanwhile, another force under the Eralppadu commanded a fleet across the sea and landed at Ponnani and later moved to Thirumanasseri, with intention to descend on Thirunavaya from the south with help of the warriors of the Thirumanasseri Brahmins. Eralppadu also prevented the warriors of Perumpadappu joining Valluvanadu forces. The Muslim merchants and commanders at Ponnani supported the Kozhikode force with food, transport and provisions. The warriors of the Eralppadu moved north and crossed the River Perar and took up position on the northern side of the river.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> The Koya marched at the head of a large column, and stormed Thirunavaya. In spite of the fact that the warriors of Valluvanadu did not get the timely help of Perumpadappu, they fought vigorously and the battle dragged on. In the meantime, the Kozhikode minister Mangattachan was also successful in turning Kadannamanna Elavakayil Vellodi (junior branch of Kadannamanna) to their side. Finally, two Valluvanadu princes were killed in the battles, the Nairs abandoned the settlement and Kozhikode infested Thirunavaya.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nThe capture of Thirunavaya was not the end of Kozhikode's expansion into Valluvanadu. The Samoothiri continued surges over on Valluvanadu. [[Malappuram]], [[Nilambur]], Vallappanattukara and [[Manjeri]] were easily occupied. He encountered stiff resistance in some places and the fights went on in a protracted and sporadic fashion for a long time. Further assaults in the east against Valluvanadu were neither prolonged nor difficult for Kozhikode.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nThe battles along the western borders of Valluvanadu were bitter, for they were marked by treachery and crime. Panthalur and Ten Kalams came under Kozhikode only after a protracted struggle. The assassination of a minister of Kozhikode by the chief minister of Valluvanadu while visiting Venkatakkotta in Valluvanadu sparked the battle, which dragged on for almost a decade. At last the Valluvanadu minister was captured by Samoothiri's warriors and executed at Padapparambu, and his province (Ten Kalams, including [[Kottakkal]] and Panthalur) were occupied by the Samoothiri. The Kizhakke Kovilakam Munalappadu, who took a leading part in this campaign, received half of the newly captured province from Samoothiri as a gift. The loss of this fiercely loyal chief minister was the greatest blow to Valluvanadu after the loss of [[Tirunavaya]] and [[Ponnani]].<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\n=== Expansions to Kochi ===\n\nKozhikode faced defeat in their next assault on Perumpadappu swaroopam. The combined forces of Perumpadappu and Valluvanadu resisted Kozhikode warriors and a vicious battle ensued for three days, at the end of which Kozhikode forces was on the retreat.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nAfter a period of uneasy calm in Kerala, Kozhikode \toccupied Nedunganadu, a small polity between Valluvanadu and [[Palakkad]] (Palghat). Nedunganadu was overran without striking even a single blow. The chief of Nedunganadu surrendered to the Kozhikode forces at a place called Kodikkuni. Then the Kozhikode warriors captured a number of smaller villages around Thirunavaya \u2013 such as Thiruvegappuram \u2013 from Valluvanadu. The Valluvanadu governor tried to overcome the Kozhikode prince's advance at Kolakkadu. Near Karimpuzha in Valluvanadu, the untouchables \u2013 the Cherumas and Panans of Kotta \u2013 resisted the advancing Kozhikode forces. The Kozhikode won their affection by gifts and presents. Kozhikode prince was met by an ancestor of Kavalappara Nair, a vassal of Valluvanadu, at Karakkadu. The chiefs under Palakkad surrendered to Kozhikode at Vengotri, Nellayi and Kakkathodu. Samoothiri of Kozhikode appointed the Eralppadu as the ruler of southern Malabar region during this time. The provincial seat was at Karimpuzha. Talappilli (present day taluk of the same name and coastal regions from Ponnani to Chetwai) and Chengazhinadu submitted to Kozhikode without any resistance.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n[[File:Portuguese fort at Calicut (cropped).jpg|thumb|472x472px|left|Portuguese fort at Kozhikode]]\n\n[[Kozhikode]] then completed the subjugation Ponnani taluk from Valluvanadu and captured Vannerinadu from Perumpadappu. The Perumpadappu ruler was forced to shift their base further south to Thiruvanchikkulam.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> When Thrikkanamathilakam near Thiruvanchikkulam came under the Kozhikode control and Perumpadappu ruler again shifted their base further south to Kochi ([[Kochi|Cochin]], in 1405 AD<ref name=Malekandathil />).<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nKozhikode subjugated large parts of the state of Kochi in the subsequent years. The family feud between the elder and younger branches of the ruling family of Kochi was exploited by the Samoothiri of Kozhikode. The intervention was initiated as Kozhikode\u2019s help was sought against the ruling younger branch. The rulers of Kodungallur, Idappalli, Airur, Sarkkara, Patinjattedam [Thrissur] and Chittur supported or joined Kozhikode forces in this occupation of Kochi . Some of these were the vassals of Kochi. The Kochi chief was defeated in a battle at Thrissur and his palace was occupied. But, the defeated chief escaped to further south. Pursuing the chief to south, the Kozhikode forces under Samoothiri penetrated and occupied the town of Kochi. Unable to withstand the attacks, Kochi finally accepted Kozhikode's rule. The prince from the elder branch was installed on the throne of Kochi as vassal.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nThe battles against Kochi were followed by a battle against Palakkad and the expansion to Naduvattom by a Kozhikode prince. Kollengode of Venganadu Nambitis was also put under the sway of Kozhikode during the time. The severe and frequent battles with Valluvanadu by Kozhikode continued. But even after the loss of his superior ally Kochi, Valluvanadu did not submit to Kozhikode. The ruler of Kozhikode followed a custom of settling Muslim families and the families of other Hindu generals who had allegiance to him, in the captured areas of Valluvanadu. Kozhikode occupied Valluvanadu (now shrunk to Attappadi valley, parts of Mannarkkad, Ottappalam and Perinthalmanna) but could not make much progress into its hinterland.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nKozhikode was also successful in bringing the polity of Kolathunadu (Cannanore) under their control. During his expansions, the Samoothiri occupied Pantalayini Kollam as a preliminary advance to Kolathunadu. Kolathiri immediately sent ambassadors to submit to whatever terms Kozhikode might dictate. Kolathunadu transferred the regions already occupied to Kozhikode and certain Hindu temple rights. The stories about the origin of the [[Kadathanadu|Kadathanadu ruling family (Vatakara)]] are associated with battle of the Eradis with Polanadu. When the Samoothiri swarmed over Polanadu, he exiled a Polarthiri royal princess and she was welcomed in [[Kolathunad|Kolathunadu (Cannanore)]] \u2013 one of the Samoothiri's rivals polities. After the marriage of a Kolathu prince with this princess the Kadathanadu ruling family was born. The name Kadathanadu refers to as the passing way between Kolathunadu and Kozhikode.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Panikkassery, Velayudhan. MM Publications (2007), Kottayam India</ref>\n<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Some land and Hindu temple rights were transferred to Kozhikode during a visit to Kollam by a ruler of the Kozhikode.<ref>K. V. Krishna Iyer, Court Historian of the Samoothiris, describes the event: \"The nominal reason for the military expedition was to protect the rights of the Brahmins in Quilon. Quilon had earlier opposed the expansion Kozhikode supremacy south of Kochi (former Perumpadappu). However, the Kozhikode forces advanced by Chetwai and Kanhur River, Samoothiri Maharaja crossed the backwater at Vypin, marching through Chiranganad Karappuram, Payattukad, Alleppey, Trikunnappuzha and Kartikappally, and entered Odanad. Soon, the ruler of Quilon propitiated Kozhikode by paying the expenses of the battles, ceding the lands known as Munjiramukkattam (Munjiramukkattam was later transferred by the Kozhikode to the temple of Padmanabha or to Mathappuram shrine). Quilon also agreed to send annual tribute along with the flag of fealty to Tirunavaya for the Mamankam festival.\"</ref>\n\n==Vijayanagara conquests==\n[[File:Uru.jpg|thumb|400px|Large boats built in Kozhikode]]\n[[Deva Raya II]] (1424\u20131446 AD), king of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], conquered the whole of present-day Kerala state in the 15th century. He defeated (1443) rulers of Venadu (Kollam, Quilon), as well as Kozhikode. [[Fern\u00e3o Nunes]] says that the Samoothiri and even the kings of Burma ruling at [[Pegu]] and [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]] paid tribute to the king of Vijayanagara Empire. Later Kozhikode and Venadu seems to have rebelled against their Vijayanagara overlords, but Deva Raya II quelled the rebellion.\n\nAs the Vijayanagara power diminished over the next fifty years, Samoothiri of Kozhikode again rose to prominence in Kerala. Samoothiri built a fort at Ponnani in 1498.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nAn embassy from the Samoothiri of Kozhikode, in which the chief envoy was a Persian-speaking Muslim, came to the Timurid court of [[Shah Rukh|Mirza Shahrukh]] at [[Herat]] in the 15th century. Some Herat officials had, some years earlier, on their return journey from the Sultanate of Bengal, been stranded at port Kozhikode, and on this occasion had been received by the Samoothiri of Kozhikode. Impressed by the description of the Timurid influence, the Samoothiri decided to send his own embassy to Herat.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAbdur Razzaq, an employ of Shahrukh, was soon engaged on a mission to Kozhikode (November 1442 \u2013 April 1443). He carried a series of presents from Herat, including a horse, a [[pelisse]], headgear and ceremonial robes. \"As for duties [at Kozhikode], at one-fortieth, and that too, only on sales, they are even lower that at Hormuz [in the Persian Gulf]\", says Abdur Razzaq.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhile in Kozhikode, Razzaq was invited by the Vijayanagara ruler Deva Raya II to his court. The envoy arrived from the Vijayanagara king had \"asked\" the Samoothiri to send the Herat envoy on to his court. He also says the king of Vijayanagara does not possess \"jurisdiction\" over the kingdom of Kozhikode, but the Samoothiri was apparently \"still in great awe of the Vijayanagar king\".<ref name=\":4\">Muzaffar Alam, Sanjay Subrahmanyam. \"Indo-Persian Travels in the Age of Discoveries, 1400\u20131800\".

Historians presume that the fleet stayed from December 1406 to April 1407 at Kozhikode. Ambassadors from Kozhikode, among envoys from other states, accompanied the returning (first expedition) fleet bringing articles of \"tribute\" to [[Nanking]] in 1407. On the second expedition, in 1408\u201309, Zheng He again visited Kozhikode\u2014stopping as well in \"Chochin\" (Kochi). The envoys in the second expedition (1408\u20131409) carried out the formal \"investiture\" of the Samoothiri of Kozhikode \"Mana Piehchialaman\".  A memorial inscription was erected in Kozhikode to commemorate the investiture. The Chinese titles and gifts (brocades and gauzes) were given to the Samoothiri and his retinue by the Chinese envoys. Presumably a stay of about four months was made at Kozhikode, possibly from December 1408 to April 1409. The third expedition (1409\u20131411)  - the first one to sail to beyond India - also visited Kozhikode. The fleet sailed on from Kozhikode to Sri Lanka in 1411.

Two factors, Hans de Wolff and Lafer, were sent on an Asian ship from Aceh, but the two were captured by the chief of Tanur, and handed over to the Portuguese. These men were later hanged in Goa.<ref name=\"SanjaySubrahmanyam2\"/>\n\nA Dutch fleet under Admiral [[Steven van der Hagen]] arrived in Kozhikode in November 1604. It marked the beginning of the Dutch presence in Kerala and they concluded a treaty with Kozhikode on 11 November 1604. By this time the kingdom and the port of Kozhikode was much reduced in importance.<ref name=\"SanjaySubrahmanyam2\"/> The treaty provided for a mutual alliance between the two to expel the Portuguese from Malabar. In return the Dutch East India Company was given facilities for trade at Kozhikode and Ponnani, including spacious storehouses.\n\nIn 1610, Cornelis Jacobsz van Breekvelt and Hans Bullardm arrived at Kozhikode and re-promulgated the old treaty. In 1617, Pieter van den Broecke was asked by a Samoothiri prince to aid them in a battle against Kochi. The Dutch refused to help the Kozhikode rulers.<ref name=\"SanjaySubrahmanyam2\"/>\n\nThe Dutch, some fifteen years after the Samoothiri first asked for help, had promised much and delivered almost nothing. The Samoothiri finally turned to the English.<ref name=\"SanjaySubrahmanyam2\"/> In September 1610, the English factors at Mocha were approached by the head of the Mappilas there to their shipping in the region from the Portuguese fleets.<ref name=\"SanjaySubrahmanyam2\"/> The English reached Kozhikode under Captain William Keeling and concluded a treaty of trade (1616) under which, among others, the English were to assist Kozhikode in expelling the Portuguese from [[Fort Emmanuel|Fort Kochi]] and [[Cranganore Fort|Fort Cranganore]]. The English set up a factory at Kozhikode, and a factor, George Woolman, is sent there with a stock of presents. But the Samoothiri soon found the English as unreliable as the Dutch where military aid was concerned. The factory was wound up in March, 1617.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"SanjaySubrahmanyam2\"/>\n\nLater in 1661, Kozhikode joined a coalition led by the Dutch to defeat the Portuguese and Kochi and conducted a number of successful campaigns. As a result of the [[Kew Letters]], the Dutch settlements on the Malabar Coast were surrendered to the British in 1795 in order to prevent them being overrun by the French. Dutch Malabar remained with the British after the conclusion of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], which traded the colony with [[Bangka Island]].\n\n===Mysore occupation and settlement negotiations===\n{{See also|Mysorean invasion of Kerala}}\n[[File:The series of steps leading into the moat between two bastions.jpg|thumb|left|Palghat Fort]]\n[[File:Kozhikode railway station.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Kozhikode Railway Station was established during the Colonial rule]]\nIt was in 1732, at the invitation of the chief of [[Palakkad]], that [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] forces marched to Kerala for the first time. They appeared again in 1735, and in 1737 they raided the Samoothiri's frontier outposts. In 1745, the Mysore forces fought three battles with the Kozhikode warriors.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/><ref name=VVHaridas /> In 1756 they invaded Kozhikode for the fifth time. The chief of Palakkad had placed himself under the protection of the King of Mysore, agreeing to pay an annual tribute of 12,000 ''fanams''. The Faujdar of [[Dindigul]], [[Hyder Ali]], sent Mukhdam Sahib, with 2000 cavalry, 5,000 infantry, and 5 guns to Kerala. The Samoothiri tried to buy off the enemy by promising (Treaty, 1756) to refrain from molesting Palakkad and pay 12 [[lakh]] rupees for the expenses of the expedition. However the Samoothiri was unable pay anything to Hyder Ali.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\nIn 1766, 12,000 [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] forces under [[Hyder Ali]] marched to Malabar from [[Mangalore]]. Mysore's intentions were made easy by the help they received from the Muslims in Malabar. Ali Raja of [[Cannanore|Kannur]], a Muslim ruler in northern Kerala, also helped the invading forces. The Mysore army conquered northern Kerala up to [[Kochi]] with relative ease. Hyder Ali inflicted a major setback on the Kozhikode warriors at Perinkolam Ferry on the Kotta River.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> As Mysore edged closer to the outer reaches of the city of Kozhikode, the Samoothiri sent most of his relatives to safe haven in Ponnani, and from there to Travancore, and to avoid the humiliation of surrender committed self-immolation by setting fire to his palace at Mananchira (27 April). Hyder Ali absorbed Malabar district to his state.<ref>Logan, William. ''Malabar''. Asian Educational Services, 1887.</ref><ref name=VVHaridas />\n\nBut as soon as the Haider Ali marched to Coimbatore, Nair rebellions broke out in Malabar. Some members of the Samoothiri family rebelled against the Muslim occupiers. This included the Eralpadu [[Krishna Varma]] with his nephew [[Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam|Ravi Varma]]. The princes were aided by the British [[East India Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceofdharma.com/books/tipu/ |title=Tipu Sultan&nbsp;\u2014 Villain Or Hero? |publisher=Voiceofdharma.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}</ref> In 1768 the Samoothiri prince was restored in Kozhikode, agreeing to pay an annual tribute to Mysore. For nearly six years till 1774 nothing was heard about Hyder Ali.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> In 1774, Mysore forces under Srinivasa Rao occupied the city of Kozhikode. The prince retired to Travancore in a native vessel. The baton of resistance now passed to his nephew [[Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam|Ravi Varma]]. Ravi Varma helped the Company occupy Kozhikode in 1782.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> By the Treaty of Mangalore, concluded in 1784, Malabar was restored to Mysore. In 1785 the oppression of revenue officers led to a rebellion by the Mappilas of Manjeri. As a reward for aiding to put down the rebels, and partly as an incentive, [[Tipu Sultan]] settled upon Ravi Varma a pension and a ''jaghir'' in 1786. The peace was soon broken and Tipu sent 6,000 troops under Mon. Lally to Kerala.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nLord Cornwallis invited the Kerala chiefs to join him in 1790, promising to render them in future entirely independent of Mysore and to retain them upon reasonable terms under the protection of the Company. Prince Ravi Varma met General Meadows at [[Trichinopoly]] and settled with him the terms of the Kozhikode's cooperation. After the Third Mysore War (1790\u20131792), Malabar was placed under the control of the Company by the Treaty of Seringapatam.<ref name=VVHaridas />\n\nIn the settlement negotiations with the Joint Commission in 1792, the Samoothiri proved recalcitrant. To pressure him, a portion of his former territories (Payyanadu, Payyormala, Kizhakkumpuram, Vadakkampuram and Pulavayi) was leased to the ruler of Kurumburanadu as manager for the East India Company. Finally, after prolonged negotiations, the hereditary territory of the Samoothiri, together with the coin mint and the sea customs, was leased back to him. He was also temporarily given jurisdiction over the petty rulers and, as a mark of the Samoothiri's exceptional position in Malabar, the revenue fixed for Beypore, Parappanadu and Vettattunadu was to be paid through him. As previously noted, these tax-payment and jurisdictional arrangements were terminated later and the Samoothiri of Kozhikode became a mere pensioned landlord receiving the \"malikhana\". On 1 July 1800, Malabar was transferred to the [[Madras Presidency]]. On 15 November 1806 the agreement upon which rested the future political relations between the Samoothiri of Kozhikode and the English was executed.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/><ref name=VVHaridas />\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:The Palace of the Zamorin of Calicut (cropped).jpg|thumb|400px|The Palace of the Samoothiri of Kozhikode in 17th century - from Dutch archives]]According to historian M.

The rulers of Kozhikode belonged to \"Nediyirippu swaroopam\" and followed matriliny system of inheritance. The eldest male member of Nediyirippu swaroopam became the Samoothiri of Kozhikode. There was a set pattern of succession, indicated by sthanams in the royal line. Five sthanams were defined in Kozhikode. These positions were based on the chronological seniority of the incumbent in the different thavazhis of the swaroopam and constituted what is called in the records as \"kuruvazhcha\". Unlike in the case of Cochin (Kochi), there was no rotation of position among the thavazhis. Thus no particular thavazhi enjoyed any privilege or precedence in the matter of succession, as the only criterion for succession was seniority of age.<ref name=VVHaridas />\n\nFive sthanams existed in Kozhikode, each with its own separate property enjoyed in succession by the senior members of the three kovilakams of the family.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\n# 1st sthanam: the Samoothiri of Kozhikode\n# 2nd sthanam: Eranadu Ilamkur Nambiyathiri Thirumulpadu (the Eralppadu).

However, during the partition of Chera kingdom, the Chera monarch failed to allocate any land to Nediyiruppu. Filled with guilt, the king later gave an unwanted piece of marshy tract of land called Kozhikode to the younger brother Vikraman (the elder brother died in the battle). The king also gifted his personal sword and his favourite prayer [[Shankha|conch]] \u2013 both broken \u2013 to him and told him to occupy as much as land as he could with all his might. So the Eradis conquered neighbouring kingdoms and created a large state for themselves.

The Cheraman sword was burnt in a surprise attack by the Dutch at Kodungallur (1670) while the Samoothiri was residing with Velutha Nambiyar. A new sword was made in 1672 out of the fragments of the old.

However, it is generally agreed among historians the Eradis were originally the autonomous rulers of Eralnadu/Eranadu region of the Kodungallur Chera kingdom.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/><ref name=\"Narayanan\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> The Kodungallur Chera kingdom was a congeries of chiefdoms, which were ruled by local chiefs. The office of the chief/senior prince of Eranadu (Eralanadu Utaya) is assumed to be the hereditary.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/><ref name=\"Narayanan\" /> The earliest reference to the chief and chiefdom of Eranadu is the Cochin Jewish copper plate (c. 1000 AD). Old Malayalam inscriptions name two titles for the rulers of Eranadu - Manvepala Manaviyata ( c. 11 century) and Manavikrama (c. 12th century). In the later period, Manavikrama, Manaveda and Viraraya were the only names given to male members in the royal family, the Samoothiri always being known as Manavikrama. Historians assume that Manaveda might be a corruption of the old Malayalam title \"Manaviyata\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Scholars tentatively identify Manaviyata and Manavikrama with the titles of the elder and younger brothers of the famous origin legend.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe strength of the \"Hundred Organisation\" of the senior prince of Eranadu was \"Six Hundred\". Hundred organisations with same capacity are also found in Ramavalanadu, Valluvanadu, Kizhmalanadu, and Venadu.

Some historians are of the view that the Eradi was in fact a favourite of the last Kodungallur Chera king as he was at the forefront of the battles with the [[Chola]]\u2013[[Pandya]] forces in south Kerala. The Eradi seems to have led the Chera army to victory. The king therefore granted him, as a mark of favour, a small tract of land on the sea-coast [Kozhikode] in addition to his hereditary possessions [Eralanadu province]. The Eradis subsequently moved their seat to the coastal \"marshy lands\" and established the city of Kozhikode.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTo corroborate his assertion that Eradi prince was a member of the inner circle of the last Chera king Rama Kulasekhara (c. 1089 - 1122), scholars cites an old Malayalam inscription (AD 1102) found on a granite pillar set up in the courtyard of the Ramashwaram temple, [[Kollam]]. According to the inscription, the king, residing at Panainkavu Palace at Kurakkeni Kollam, sitting in council with Arya Brahmins, the Four Brahmin Ministers, the Leader of the Thousand Nairs, the Leader of the Six Hundred Nairs of Venadu, Punthurakkon Manavikrama - the chief of Eranadu, and other feudatories, made prayaschittam for (some) offence against the Arya Brahmins by donating paddy for daily feeding the Brahmins and leasing out a Cherikkal for that purpose to Venadu chief Kumaran Udaya Varma.<ref>Narayanan.

The Eradi marched with his Nairs towards [[Panniyankara]] and besieged the Polarthiri at his base, resulting in a 48-year-long standoff. The Eradi was unsuccessful, and then he propitiated the [[Bhagavati]], bribed the followers of Polarthiri and even the consort of the ruler of Polanadu and won them to his side. Learning of this treachery Polarthiri fled from Kozhikode. The Eradi emerged victorious and shifted his seat from [[Nediyiruppu]] to Kozhikode - then also called \"Thrivikramapuram\". The Eradis built a fort (Koyil Kotta) at a place called \"Velapuram\" (port) to safeguard their new interests.<ref name=\":7\">Menon. A Sreedhara, \"A Survey of Kerala History\", DC Books, 2007 - Kerala (India)</ref><ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>''\n\nThe power balance in Kerala changed as Eralnadu rulers developed the port at Kozhikode. The Samoothiri became one of the most powerful chiefs in Kerala.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> In some of his military campaigns \u2013 such as that into Valluvanadu \u2013 the ruler received unambiguous assistance from the Muslim Middle Eastern sailors.<ref name=\"VVHaridas\" /> It seems that the Muslim judge of Kozhikode offered all help in \"money and material\" to the Samoothiri to strike at Thirunavaya.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nSmaller chiefdoms south of Kozhikode \u2013 Beypore, Chaliyam, Parappanadu and Tanur (Vettam) \u2013 soon had to submit and became their feudatories one by one. The rulers of Payyormala, [[Kurumbranad]]u, and other Nair chiefs on the suburbs of Kozhikode also acknowledged the supremacy of Kozhikode. There were battles between Kozhikode and Kurumbranadu for a coastal region called Payyanadu. Payyanadu was a part of Kurumbranadu in early times, and was eventually given as a \"royal gift\" to Kozhikode. Kozhikode easily overran the Kurumbranadu warriors in the battle and Kurumbranadu had to sue for peace by surrendering Valisseri.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n[[File:Treasure Boat Shipyard - stele pavilion - Calicut stele - P1080100.JPG|thumb|Modern replica of the stele installed at Kozhikode by [[Zheng He]].

Inscription specifically mentions the word \"Punturakkon\"]]\t\n\nThe ruler of Kozhikode next turned his attention to the valley of [[Bharathappuzha|Perar]]. Large parts of the valley was then ruled by Valluvakkonathiri, the ancient hereditary chief of Valluvanadu. The principal objective of Kozhikode was the capture the sacred settlement of [[Tirunavaya|Thirunavaya]]. Soon the Samoothiris found themselves intervened in the so-called ''kurmatsaram'' between Nambudiris of Panniyurkur and Chovvarakur. In the most recent event, the Nambudiris from Thirumanasseri Nadu had assaulted and burned the nearby rival village. The rulers of Valluvanadu and [[Perumpadappu (Malappuram district)|Perumpadappu]] came to help the Chovvaram and raided Panniyur simultaneously. Thirumanasseri Nadu was overran by its neighbours on south and east. The Thirumanasseri Nambudiri appealed to the ruler of Kozhikode for help, and promised to cede the port of [[Ponnani]] to Kozhikode as the price for his protection. Kozhikode, looking for such an opportunity, gladly accepted the offer.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nAssisted by the warriors of their subordinate chiefs (Chaliyam, [[Beypore]], [[Kingdom of Tanur|Tanur]] and [[Cranganore|Kodungallur]]) and the Muslim naval fleet under the Koya of Kozhikode, the Samoothiri's fighters advanced by both land and sea.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> The main force under the command of Samoothiri himself attacked, encamping at Thripangodu, an allied force of Valluvanadu and Perumpadappu from the north. Meanwhile, another force under the Eralppadu commanded a fleet across the sea and landed at Ponnani and later moved to Thirumanasseri, with intention to descend on Thirunavaya from the south with help of the warriors of the Thirumanasseri Brahmins. Eralppadu also prevented the warriors of Perumpadappu joining Valluvanadu forces. The Muslim merchants and commanders at Ponnani supported the Kozhikode force with food, transport and provisions. The warriors of the Eralppadu moved north and crossed the River Perar and took up position on the northern side of the river.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> The Koya marched at the head of a large column, and stormed Thirunavaya. In spite of the fact that the warriors of Valluvanadu did not get the timely help of Perumpadappu, they fought vigorously and the battle dragged on. In the meantime, the Kozhikode minister Mangattachan was also successful in turning Kadannamanna Elavakayil Vellodi (junior branch of Kadannamanna) to their side. Finally, two Valluvanadu princes were killed in the battles, the Nairs abandoned the settlement and Kozhikode infested Thirunavaya.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nThe capture of Thirunavaya was not the end of Kozhikode's expansion into Valluvanadu. The Samoothiri continued surges over on Valluvanadu. [[Malappuram]], [[Nilambur]], Vallappanattukara and [[Manjeri]] were easily occupied. He encountered stiff resistance in some places and the fights went on in a protracted and sporadic fashion for a long time. Further assaults in the east against Valluvanadu were neither prolonged nor difficult for Kozhikode.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nThe battles along the western borders of Valluvanadu were bitter, for they were marked by treachery and crime. Panthalur and Ten Kalams came under Kozhikode only after a protracted struggle. The assassination of a minister of Kozhikode by the chief minister of Valluvanadu while visiting Venkatakkotta in Valluvanadu sparked the battle, which dragged on for almost a decade. At last the Valluvanadu minister was captured by Samoothiri's warriors and executed at Padapparambu, and his province (Ten Kalams, including [[Kottakkal]] and Panthalur) were occupied by the Samoothiri. The Kizhakke Kovilakam Munalappadu, who took a leading part in this campaign, received half of the newly captured province from Samoothiri as a gift. The loss of this fiercely loyal chief minister was the greatest blow to Valluvanadu after the loss of [[Tirunavaya]] and [[Ponnani]].<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\n=== Expansions to Kochi ===\n\nKozhikode faced defeat in their next assault on Perumpadappu swaroopam. The combined forces of Perumpadappu and Valluvanadu resisted Kozhikode warriors and a vicious battle ensued for three days, at the end of which Kozhikode forces was on the retreat.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nAfter a period of uneasy calm in Kerala, Kozhikode \toccupied Nedunganadu, a small polity between Valluvanadu and [[Palakkad]] (Palghat). Nedunganadu was overran without striking even a single blow. The chief of Nedunganadu surrendered to the Kozhikode forces at a place called Kodikkuni. Then the Kozhikode warriors captured a number of smaller villages around Thirunavaya \u2013 such as Thiruvegappuram \u2013 from Valluvanadu. The Valluvanadu governor tried to overcome the Kozhikode prince's advance at Kolakkadu. Near Karimpuzha in Valluvanadu, the untouchables \u2013 the Cherumas and Panans of Kotta \u2013 resisted the advancing Kozhikode forces. The Kozhikode won their affection by gifts and presents. Kozhikode prince was met by an ancestor of Kavalappara Nair, a vassal of Valluvanadu, at Karakkadu. The chiefs under Palakkad surrendered to Kozhikode at Vengotri, Nellayi and Kakkathodu. Samoothiri of Kozhikode appointed the Eralppadu as the ruler of southern Malabar region during this time. The provincial seat was at Karimpuzha. Talappilli (present day taluk of the same name and coastal regions from Ponnani to Chetwai) and Chengazhinadu submitted to Kozhikode without any resistance.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n[[File:Portuguese fort at Calicut (cropped).jpg|thumb|472x472px|left|Portuguese fort at Kozhikode]]\n\n[[Kozhikode]] then completed the subjugation Ponnani taluk from Valluvanadu and captured Vannerinadu from Perumpadappu. The Perumpadappu ruler was forced to shift their base further south to Thiruvanchikkulam.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> When Thrikkanamathilakam near Thiruvanchikkulam came under the Kozhikode control and Perumpadappu ruler again shifted their base further south to Kochi ([[Kochi|Cochin]], in 1405 AD<ref name=Malekandathil />).<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nKozhikode subjugated large parts of the state of Kochi in the subsequent years. The family feud between the elder and younger branches of the ruling family of Kochi was exploited by the Samoothiri of Kozhikode. The intervention was initiated as Kozhikode\u2019s help was sought against the ruling younger branch. The rulers of Kodungallur, Idappalli, Airur, Sarkkara, Patinjattedam [Thrissur] and Chittur supported or joined Kozhikode forces in this occupation of Kochi . Some of these were the vassals of Kochi. The Kochi chief was defeated in a battle at Thrissur and his palace was occupied. But, the defeated chief escaped to further south. Pursuing the chief to south, the Kozhikode forces under Samoothiri penetrated and occupied the town of Kochi. Unable to withstand the attacks, Kochi finally accepted Kozhikode's rule. The prince from the elder branch was installed on the throne of Kochi as vassal.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nThe battles against Kochi were followed by a battle against Palakkad and the expansion to Naduvattom by a Kozhikode prince. Kollengode of Venganadu Nambitis was also put under the sway of Kozhikode during the time. The severe and frequent battles with Valluvanadu by Kozhikode continued. But even after the loss of his superior ally Kochi, Valluvanadu did not submit to Kozhikode. The ruler of Kozhikode followed a custom of settling Muslim families and the families of other Hindu generals who had allegiance to him, in the captured areas of Valluvanadu. Kozhikode occupied Valluvanadu (now shrunk to Attappadi valley, parts of Mannarkkad, Ottappalam and Perinthalmanna) but could not make much progress into its hinterland.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nKozhikode was also successful in bringing the polity of Kolathunadu (Cannanore) under their control. During his expansions, the Samoothiri occupied Pantalayini Kollam as a preliminary advance to Kolathunadu. Kolathiri immediately sent ambassadors to submit to whatever terms Kozhikode might dictate. Kolathunadu transferred the regions already occupied to Kozhikode and certain Hindu temple rights. The stories about the origin of the [[Kadathanadu|Kadathanadu ruling family (Vatakara)]] are associated with battle of the Eradis with Polanadu. When the Samoothiri swarmed over Polanadu, he exiled a Polarthiri royal princess and she was welcomed in [[Kolathunad|Kolathunadu (Cannanore)]] \u2013 one of the Samoothiri's rivals polities. After the marriage of a Kolathu prince with this princess the Kadathanadu ruling family was born. The name Kadathanadu refers to as the passing way between Kolathunadu and Kozhikode.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Panikkassery, Velayudhan. MM Publications (2007), Kottayam India</ref>\n<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Some land and Hindu temple rights were transferred to Kozhikode during a visit to Kollam by a ruler of the Kozhikode.<ref>K. V. Krishna Iyer, Court Historian of the Samoothiris, describes the event: \"The nominal reason for the military expedition was to protect the rights of the Brahmins in Quilon. Quilon had earlier opposed the expansion Kozhikode supremacy south of Kochi (former Perumpadappu). However, the Kozhikode forces advanced by Chetwai and Kanhur River, Samoothiri Maharaja crossed the backwater at Vypin, marching through Chiranganad Karappuram, Payattukad, Alleppey, Trikunnappuzha and Kartikappally, and entered Odanad. Soon, the ruler of Quilon propitiated Kozhikode by paying the expenses of the battles, ceding the lands known as Munjiramukkattam (Munjiramukkattam was later transferred by the Kozhikode to the temple of Padmanabha or to Mathappuram shrine). Quilon also agreed to send annual tribute along with the flag of fealty to Tirunavaya for the Mamankam festival.\"</ref>\n\n==Vijayanagara conquests==\n[[File:Uru.jpg|thumb|400px|Large boats built in Kozhikode]]\n[[Deva Raya II]] (1424\u20131446 AD), king of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], conquered the whole of present-day Kerala state in the 15th century. He defeated (1443) rulers of Venadu (Kollam, Quilon), as well as Kozhikode. [[Fern\u00e3o Nunes]] says that the Samoothiri and even the kings of Burma ruling at [[Pegu]] and [[Tenasserim Division|Tenasserim]] paid tribute to the king of Vijayanagara Empire. Later Kozhikode and Venadu seems to have rebelled against their Vijayanagara overlords, but Deva Raya II quelled the rebellion.\n\nAs the Vijayanagara power diminished over the next fifty years, Samoothiri of Kozhikode again rose to prominence in Kerala.

Some Herat officials had, some years earlier, on their return journey from the Sultanate of Bengal, been stranded at port Kozhikode, and on this occasion had been received by the Samoothiri of Kozhikode. Impressed by the description of the Timurid influence, the Samoothiri decided to send his own embassy to Herat.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAbdur Razzaq, an employ of Shahrukh, was soon engaged on a mission to Kozhikode (November 1442 \u2013 April 1443). He carried a series of presents from Herat, including a horse, a [[pelisse]], headgear and ceremonial robes. \"As for duties [at Kozhikode], at one-fortieth, and that too, only on sales, they are even lower that at Hormuz [in the Persian Gulf]\", says Abdur Razzaq.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nWhile in Kozhikode, Razzaq was invited by the Vijayanagara ruler Deva Raya II to his court. The envoy arrived from the Vijayanagara king had \"asked\" the Samoothiri to send the Herat envoy on to his court. He also says the king of Vijayanagara does not possess \"jurisdiction\" over the kingdom of Kozhikode, but the Samoothiri was apparently \"still in great awe of the Vijayanagar king\".<ref name=\":4\">Muzaffar Alam, Sanjay Subrahmanyam. \"Indo-Persian Travels in the Age of Discoveries, 1400\u20131800\".

It marked the beginning of the Dutch presence in Kerala and they concluded a treaty with Kozhikode on 11 November 1604. By this time the kingdom and the port of Kozhikode was much reduced in importance.<ref name=\"SanjaySubrahmanyam2\"/> The treaty provided for a mutual alliance between the two to expel the Portuguese from Malabar. In return the Dutch East India Company was given facilities for trade at Kozhikode and Ponnani, including spacious storehouses.\n\nIn 1610, Cornelis Jacobsz van Breekvelt and Hans Bullardm arrived at Kozhikode and re-promulgated the old treaty. In 1617, Pieter van den Broecke was asked by a Samoothiri prince to aid them in a battle against Kochi. The Dutch refused to help the Kozhikode rulers.<ref name=\"SanjaySubrahmanyam2\"/>\n\nThe Dutch, some fifteen years after the Samoothiri first asked for help, had promised much and delivered almost nothing.

The English set up a factory at Kozhikode, and a factor, George Woolman, is sent there with a stock of presents. But the Samoothiri soon found the English as unreliable as the Dutch where military aid was concerned. The factory was wound up in March, 1617.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"SanjaySubrahmanyam2\"/>\n\nLater in 1661, Kozhikode joined a coalition led by the Dutch to defeat the Portuguese and Kochi and conducted a number of successful campaigns. As a result of the [[Kew Letters]], the Dutch settlements on the Malabar Coast were surrendered to the British in 1795 in order to prevent them being overrun by the French. Dutch Malabar remained with the British after the conclusion of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], which traded the colony with [[Bangka Island]].\n\n===Mysore occupation and settlement negotiations===\n{{See also|Mysorean invasion of Kerala}}\n[[File:The series of steps leading into the moat between two bastions.jpg|thumb|left|Palghat Fort]]\n[[File:Kozhikode railway station.jpg|thumb|400px|left|Kozhikode Railway Station was established during the Colonial rule]]\nIt was in 1732, at the invitation of the chief of [[Palakkad]], that [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] forces marched to Kerala for the first time. They appeared again in 1735, and in 1737 they raided the Samoothiri's frontier outposts. In 1745, the Mysore forces fought three battles with the Kozhikode warriors.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/><ref name=VVHaridas /> In 1756 they invaded Kozhikode for the fifth time. The chief of Palakkad had placed himself under the protection of the King of Mysore, agreeing to pay an annual tribute of 12,000 ''fanams''. The Faujdar of [[Dindigul]], [[Hyder Ali]], sent Mukhdam Sahib, with 2000 cavalry, 5,000 infantry, and 5 guns to Kerala. The Samoothiri tried to buy off the enemy by promising (Treaty, 1756) to refrain from molesting Palakkad and pay 12 [[lakh]] rupees for the expenses of the expedition. However the Samoothiri was unable pay anything to Hyder Ali.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\nIn 1766, 12,000 [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] forces under [[Hyder Ali]] marched to Malabar from [[Mangalore]]. Mysore's intentions were made easy by the help they received from the Muslims in Malabar. Ali Raja of [[Cannanore|Kannur]], a Muslim ruler in northern Kerala, also helped the invading forces. The Mysore army conquered northern Kerala up to [[Kochi]] with relative ease. Hyder Ali inflicted a major setback on the Kozhikode warriors at Perinkolam Ferry on the Kotta River.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> As Mysore edged closer to the outer reaches of the city of Kozhikode, the Samoothiri sent most of his relatives to safe haven in Ponnani, and from there to Travancore, and to avoid the humiliation of surrender committed self-immolation by setting fire to his palace at Mananchira (27 April). Hyder Ali absorbed Malabar district to his state.<ref>Logan, William. ''Malabar''. Asian Educational Services, 1887.</ref><ref name=VVHaridas />\n\nBut as soon as the Haider Ali marched to Coimbatore, Nair rebellions broke out in Malabar. Some members of the Samoothiri family rebelled against the Muslim occupiers. This included the Eralpadu [[Krishna Varma]] with his nephew [[Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam|Ravi Varma]]. The princes were aided by the British [[East India Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voiceofdharma.com/books/tipu/ |title=Tipu Sultan&nbsp;\u2014 Villain Or Hero? |publisher=Voiceofdharma.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}</ref> In 1768 the Samoothiri prince was restored in Kozhikode, agreeing to pay an annual tribute to Mysore. For nearly six years till 1774 nothing was heard about Hyder Ali.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> In 1774, Mysore forces under Srinivasa Rao occupied the city of Kozhikode. The prince retired to Travancore in a native vessel. The baton of resistance now passed to his nephew [[Ravi Varma of Padinjare Kovilakam|Ravi Varma]]. Ravi Varma helped the Company occupy Kozhikode in 1782.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/> By the Treaty of Mangalore, concluded in 1784, Malabar was restored to Mysore. In 1785 the oppression of revenue officers led to a rebellion by the Mappilas of Manjeri. As a reward for aiding to put down the rebels, and partly as an incentive, [[Tipu Sultan]] settled upon Ravi Varma a pension and a ''jaghir'' in 1786. The peace was soon broken and Tipu sent 6,000 troops under Mon. Lally to Kerala.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/>\n\nLord Cornwallis invited the Kerala chiefs to join him in 1790, promising to render them in future entirely independent of Mysore and to retain them upon reasonable terms under the protection of the Company. Prince Ravi Varma met General Meadows at [[Trichinopoly]] and settled with him the terms of the Kozhikode's cooperation. After the Third Mysore War (1790\u20131792), Malabar was placed under the control of the Company by the Treaty of Seringapatam.<ref name=VVHaridas />\n\nIn the settlement negotiations with the Joint Commission in 1792, the Samoothiri proved recalcitrant. To pressure him, a portion of his former territories (Payyanadu, Payyormala, Kizhakkumpuram, Vadakkampuram and Pulavayi) was leased to the ruler of Kurumburanadu as manager for the East India Company. Finally, after prolonged negotiations, the hereditary territory of the Samoothiri, together with the coin mint and the sea customs, was leased back to him. He was also temporarily given jurisdiction over the petty rulers and, as a mark of the Samoothiri's exceptional position in Malabar, the revenue fixed for Beypore, Parappanadu and Vettattunadu was to be paid through him. As previously noted, these tax-payment and jurisdictional arrangements were terminated later and the Samoothiri of Kozhikode became a mere pensioned landlord receiving the \"malikhana\". On 1 July 1800, Malabar was transferred to the [[Madras Presidency]]. On 15 November 1806 the agreement upon which rested the future political relations between the Samoothiri of Kozhikode and the English was executed.<ref name=\"KrishnaIyer2\"/><ref name=VVHaridas />\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:The Palace of the Zamorin of Calicut (cropped).jpg|thumb|400px|The Palace of the Samoothiri of Kozhikode in 17th century - from Dutch archives]]According to historian M.
