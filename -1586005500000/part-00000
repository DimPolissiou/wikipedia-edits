In 2005, he was chosen to be one of the group of background dancers at the [[51st Filmfare Awards]]. In 2006, he was part of the troupe that went to Australia to perform in the cultural program at the opening ceremony of the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]]. By this time, he was tired of engineering. He was happy and successful in the dance and drama classes, and decided to do what he was good at. He dropped out of engineering and devoted himself full-time to dancing and acting.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nTo make a break into films, Rajput moved to [[Mumbai]] and joined [[Nadira Babbar]]'s ''Ekjute'' theatre group, which he remained a part of for two and a half years.<ref name=\"Sushant Singh Interview\"/> During this time, he was featured in a TV advertisement for Nestle Munch, which became famous throughout India.\n\n===Television (2008\u201312)===\nIn 2008, the casting team of [[Balaji Telefilms]] saw Rajput's personality and acting talent while he was on stage for one of Ekjute's plays. They invited him to audition for them and Rajput landed the role of Preet Juneja in [[Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil]]. His character was killed quite early in the show, but he was such a popular character with the viewers that he was brought back for the series finale in the form of a [[spirit]], looking on as his family celebrates after going through difficult times.\n\nIn June 2009, Rajput began starring in [[Pavitra Rishta]] as Manav Deshmukh, a serious and mature character working as a mechanic to help support his family. His work in this serial received wide appreciation, and Rajput received three major television awards for best male actor and most popular actor. This performance was his breakthrough and gave him a stepping stone into films.\n\nIn May 2010, Rajput joined the dance reality show [[Zara Nachke Dikha]] 2. He had already proven his acting talents by winning awards for his performance in [[Pavitra Rishta]], and he wanted to establish that he had good dancing skills and could be trained further. In ''Zara Nachke Dikha'', Rajput was a part of the Mast Kalandar Boys Team. He did the shooting for both ''Pavitra Rishta'' and ''Zara Nachke Dikha 2'' at the same time. On the Mother's Day special episode, his team dedicated a performance to his mother, who had died in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/celebritymicro/videos/id/37601/type/view/videoid/1213307|title=Mother's Day Special On 'Zara Nachke Dikha' \u2013 Abhishek Awasthi \u2013 Latest Celebrity Videos \u2013 Bollywood Hungama|author=Bollywood Hungama|work=Bollywood Hungama}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2010, Rajput participated in another dance-based reality show, [[Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 4]], where he was paired with choreographer Shampa Sonthalia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-03-09/tv/28667826_1_grand-finale-prize-money-dance |title=Chang wins Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa 4 |author=Gaurav Malani |work=The Times of India |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=25 August 2012}}</ref> In October 2011, Rajput decided to quit ''Pavitra Rishta'' to pursue a film-making course abroad.\n\n===Film career (2013\u2013present)===\n[[File:Sushant, Raj Kumar, Abhishek and Amit at KAI PO CHE's success bash.jpg|thumb|left|250px|From left to right: Rajput, [[Rajkumar Rao]], [[Abhishek Kapoor]] and [[Amit Sadh]] at the promotion of ''[[Kai Po Che!]]'' in 2013]]\n\nRajput auditioned for [[Abhishek Kapoor]]'s ''[[Kai Po Che!]]'' and was selected to play one of the three leads, along with [[Rajkumar Rao]] and [[Amit Sadh]].

He was happy and successful in the dance and drama classes, and decided to do what he was good at. He dropped out of engineering and devoted himself full-time to dancing and acting.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nTo make a break into films, Rajput moved to [[Mumbai]] and joined [[Nadira Babbar]]'s ''Ekjute'' theatre group, which he remained a part of for two and a half years.<ref name=\"Sushant Singh Interview\"/> During this time, he was featured in a TV advertisement for Nestle Munch, which became famous throughout India.\n\n===Television (2008\u201312)===\nIn 2008, the casting team of [[Balaji Telefilms]] saw Rajput's personality and acting talent while he was on stage for one of Ekjute's plays.

His character was killed quite early in the show, but he was such a popular character with the viewers that he was brought back for the series finale in the form of a [[spirit]], looking on as his family celebrates after going through difficult times.\n\nIn June 2009, Rajput began starring in [[Pavitra Rishta]] as Manav Deshmukh, a serious and mature character working as a mechanic to help support his family. His work in this serial received wide appreciation, and Rajput received three major television awards for best male actor and most popular actor. This performance was his breakthrough and gave him a stepping stone into films.\n\nIn May 2010, Rajput joined the dance reality show [[Zara Nachke Dikha]] 2. He had already proven his acting talents by winning awards for his performance in [[Pavitra Rishta]], and he wanted to establish that he had good dancing skills and could be trained further. In ''Zara Nachke Dikha'', Rajput was a part of the Mast Kalandar Boys Team. He did the shooting for both ''Pavitra Rishta'' and ''Zara Nachke Dikha 2'' at the same time.

{"title_page": "Islands of lake Balkhash", "text_new": "{{inline|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Lake Balkhash]] was formed due to uneven subsidence of the Turan plate and flooding of the formed depressions presumably in the second period of the [[Cenozoic|Cenozoic era]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} Elevated areas of the plate formed many small and several large Islands.\n\nIn total, there are 43 Islands on lake Balkhash, covering 66 square km. The Islands of Basaral, Tasaral, Ortaaral, Ozinaral, and Algazi are the most important and largest of the Balkhash Islands. There are few Islands in the salty part of Balkhash. Therefore, the current name of the lake comes from the word \"Balkh\" of the [[Tatar]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and South Altaic languages, which means \"hummocks in the swamp\".\n\n==Description==\nThe island of Algazy is one of the largest and is located in the middle part of [[lake Balkhash]], stretched from North-West to South-East for 7 kilometers, width from 1 to 3 kilometers, area of about 13 kilometers square. To the North of the island is the Baigabyl Peninsula. The island is separated from the North shore by a Strait 1.5 kilometers wide, and from the South by a Strait about 4 kilometers wide. The coast is flat, the North-Western part is most elevated, the absolute height is 366 meters above sea level. It is composed of Devonian sandstones with tuff layers.\n\nThe land surface near the lake is covered with sparse sagebrush-Solyanka vegetation on brown gravelly soils.\nBetween the long Baigabyl Peninsula and the wide Balay Peninsula, the lake is deeply cut by the narrow Bay of Balyktykol, which means \"fish\". In the middle of the very beginning of the Bay, small Islands stretch one after another \u2014 a real archipelago. At the exit of the Bay, almost opposite the village of [[:ru:\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043c\u044b|Karakum]], where the fish factory \"Algazinsky\" is located, is the last island of the archipelago. The locals call it \"Shaitanka\" which is Devil's island. All the other Islands combined under the name Abdikarim.\nThe first tiny island, like a large granite monument, is covered with green reeds on one side. It was a favorite resting place for cormorants. They left a lot of \"business cards\"on the light granite.\nThe second island looks like a rounded and green hill. It is overgrown with saltpeter and teresken. These two types of shrubs predominate only in these places. On one side of the island is an area of green reeds. The island with a diameter of about seventy meters is densely populated with birds: jackdaws, grey herons, silver gulls, Kestrels. All this feathered society is tolerant of each other.\n\nOne of the Islands of the archipelago is located opposite the tiny and semi-abandoned village of Sarykamys. It is very picturesque, strongly indented, it has two large lakes connected by a narrow channel with Balkhash, several wonderful beaches. Lonely mounds crown the highest parts of the island, and on a small plain near the shore is a circle, about ten meters in diameter, laid out of large stones, half-buried in the soil.\n\nThe ancient mounds are all made of large rubble brought from the shore. Near each were groups of stones. Time has changed their location, but sometimes they have kept the shape of a regular circle or rectangle. Near one of them, a stone circle was made up of large, upright stones. All this resembled Saka burial sites.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of the area where the lake is located is of the desert type.

The Islands of Basaral, Tasaral, Ortaaral, Ozinaral, and Algazi are the most important and largest of the Balkhash Islands. There are few Islands in the salty part of Balkhash. Therefore, the current name of the lake comes from the word \"Balkh\" of the [[Tatar]], [[Kazakh]] and South Altaic languages, which means \"hummocks in the swamp\".\n\n==Description==\nThe island of Algazy is one of the largest and is located in the middle part of [[lake Balkhash]], stretched from North-West to South-East for 7 kilometers, width from 1 to 3 kilometers, area of about 13 kilometers square. To the North of the island is the Baigabyl Peninsula. The island is separated from the North shore by a Strait 1.5 kilometers wide, and from the South by a Strait about 4 kilometers wide. The coast is flat, the North-Western part is most elevated, the absolute height is 366 meters above sea level. It is composed of Devonian sandstones with tuff layers.\n\nThe land surface near the lake is covered with sparse sagebrush-Solyanka vegetation on brown gravelly soils.\nBetween the long Baigabyl Peninsula and the wide Balay Peninsula, the lake is deeply cut by the narrow Bay of Balyktykol, which means \"fish\". In the middle of the very beginning of the Bay, small Islands stretch one after another \u2014 a real archipelago. At the exit of the Bay, almost opposite the village of [[:ru:\u041a\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043c\u044b|Karakum]], where the fish factory \"Algazinsky\" is located, is the last island of the archipelago. The locals call it \"Shaitanka\" which is Devil's island. All the other Islands combined under the name Abdikarim.\nThe first tiny island, like a large granite monument, is covered with green reeds on one side. It was a favorite resting place for cormorants. They left a lot of \"business cards\"on the light granite.\nThe second island looks like a rounded and green hill. It is overgrown with saltpeter and teresken. These two types of shrubs predominate only in these places. On one side of the island is an area of green reeds. The island with a diameter of about seventy meters is densely populated with birds: jackdaws, grey herons, silver gulls, Kestrels. All this feathered society is tolerant of each other.\n\nOne of the Islands of the archipelago is located opposite the tiny and semi-abandoned village of Sarykamys. It is very picturesque, strongly indented, it has two large lakes connected by a narrow channel with Balkhash, several wonderful beaches. Lonely mounds crown the highest parts of the island, and on a small plain near the shore is a circle, about ten meters in diameter, laid out of large stones, half-buried in the soil.\n\nThe ancient mounds are all made of large rubble brought from the shore. Near each were groups of stones. Time has changed their location, but sometimes they have kept the shape of a regular circle or rectangle. Near one of them, a stone circle was made up of large, upright stones. All this resembled Saka burial sites.\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of the area where the lake is located is of the desert type. Precipitation is extremely low: the average monthly figure is no more than 11-12 mm.the wettest month is may, during which up to 16 mm of precipitation falls. On average, no more than 111 mm per year. The warmest month of the year is July, the air warms up to +30 \u00b0C. Winter is quite mild, the temperature minimum is recorded annually in January: no more than -14 \u00b0C.\n\n==Tourism==\nThe lake has recreational potential. Various sporting events have been held for several years as part of the movement to preserve the lake's diverse landscapes.

Plastic stills can  achieve a vapor alcohol content of 40%. Plastic stills are common for [[homebrewing]] of [[moonshine]] because they are cheap and easy to manufacture. The principle is that a smaller amount of liquid is placed in an open smaller vessel inside a larger one that is closed. The liquid is kept heated by an [[Electric_heating#Immersion_heater|immersion heater]] at about 50 \u00b0 C, which causes it to slowly evaporate and condense on the inner walls of the outer vessel. The condensation that accumulates in the bottom of the vessel can then be diverted directly down through a filter containing [[activated carbon]]. The final product has approximately twice as much alcohol content as the starting liquid and can be distilled several times if stronger distillate is desired. The method is slow, and is not suitable for large-scale production.\n\n===Boiling stills===\n\n====Fractional distillation====\n\n=====Column still=====\n{{main|Column still}}\n[[File:Column still.svg|thumb|left|Legend: <br/>\nA.

Column and cooler consist of a 5 meter long copper tube wound in spiral form. The tube first goes up to act as a simple column, and then down to cool the product. Cookware usually consists of a 30 liter wine bucket in pp plastic. The heat source is typically a 300W dip heater. The spiral burner is popular because despite its simple construction and low manufacturing cost it can provide 95% alcohol.\n\n====Pot still====\n{{main|Pot still}}\n[[File:Pot Still Diagram.jpg|thumb|200px|A diagram showing the metal pot and the condensation coil apparatus]]\n\nA pot still is a type of distillation apparatus or [[still]] used to [[Distillation|distill]] [[flavored liquor]]s such as [[whisky]] or [[cognac]], but not [[rectified spirit]] because they are bad at separating [[Congener (beverages)|congener]]s. Pot stills operate on a [[batch distillation]] basis (as opposed to a [[Coffey still|Coffey]] or column stills which operate on a [[continuous distillation|continuous]] basis). Traditionally constructed from [[copper]], pot stills are made in a range of shapes and sizes depending on the quantity and style of spirit desired.\n\nSpirits distilled in pots is commonly 40% ABV, and top out between 60-80% after multiple distillations.\n\n== Safety ==\nPoorly produced moonshine can be contaminated, mainly from materials used in the construction of the [[still]]. Stills employing [[Radiator (engine cooling)|automotive radiators]] as condensers are particularly dangerous; in some cases, [[glycol]] produced from [[antifreeze (coolant)|antifreeze]] can be a problem. Radiators used as condensers could also contain [[lead]] at the connections to the plumbing.

Plastic stills can  achieve a vapor alcohol content of 40%. Plastic stills are common for [[homebrewing]] of [[moonshine]] because they are cheap and easy to manufacture. The principle is that a smaller amount of liquid is placed in an open smaller vessel inside a larger one that is closed. The liquid is kept heated by an [[Electric_heating#Immersion_heater|immersion heater]] at about 50 \u00b0 C, which causes it to slowly evaporate and condense on the inner walls of the outer vessel. The condensation that accumulates in the bottom of the vessel can then be diverted directly down through a filter containing [[activated carbon]]. The final product has approximately twice as much alcohol content as the starting liquid and can be distilled several times if stronger distillate is desired. The method is slow, and is not suitable for large-scale production.\n\n===Boiling stills===\n\n====Fractional distillation====\n\n=====Column still=====\n{{main|Column still}}\n[[File:Column still.svg|thumb|left|Legend: <br/>\nA.

Column and cooler consist of a 5 meter long copper tube wound in spiral form. The tube first goes up to act as a simple column, and then down to cool the product. Cookware usually consists of a 30 liter wine bucket in pp plastic. The heat source is typically a 300W dip heater. The spiral burner is popular because despite its simple construction and low manufacturing cost it can provide 95% alcohol.\n\n====Pot still====\n{{main|Pot still}}\n[[File:Pot Still Diagram.jpg|thumb|200px|A diagram showing the metal pot and the condensation coil apparatus]]\n\nA pot still is a type of distillation apparatus or [[still]] used to [[Distillation|distill]] [[flavored liquor]]s such as [[whisky]] or [[cognac]], but not [[rectified spirit]] because they are bad at separating [[Congener (beverages)|congener]]s.
