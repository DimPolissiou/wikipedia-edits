Insomnia is a common problem involving trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting quality sleep. CBT-I aims to improve sleep habits and behaviors by identifying  and changing the thoughts and the behaviors that affect the ability of a person to sleep or sleep well.\n\nThe first step in treating insomnia with CBT-I is to identify the underlying causes of insomnia. People with insomnia should evaluate or have their sleep patterns evaluated and take into account all possible factors that may be affecting the person's ability to sleep. This would involve keeping a sleep diary or journal for a couple weeks. The journal will help to identify patterns of thoughts or behaviors, stressors, etc. that could be contributing to the person's insomnia.<ref>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Part 1. (n.d.).

In CBT-I these steps include stimulus control, sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, relaxation training, and cognitive therapy. Some sleep specialists recommend [[biofeedback]] as well.<ref>Insomnia.

It is also effective in treatment of insomnia related to or caused by mood disorders. Those who suffer with PTSD have also shown improvement.\n\n==Components of CBT-I==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; width:40em; border:solid 1px #999999; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" \n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #CCEEEE;\" | Behavioral practices to treat insomnia<ref name=\"BBDinsomnia\">{{Citation |author1 =Consumer Reports|author1-link =Consumer Reports |author2 = Drug Effectiveness Review Project |author2-link =Drug Effectiveness Review Project |date=July 2008 |title=Evaluating Newer Sleeping Pills Used to Treat Insomnia: Comparing Effectiveness, Safety, and Price |publisher = Consumer Reports |work = Best Buy Drugs |page = 4 |url = http://www.consumerreports.org/health/resources/pdf/best-buy-drugs/InsomniaUpdate-FINAL-July2008.pdf |accessdate = 4 June 2013}}</ref>\n|-\n|\n*Practicing [[sleep hygiene]] by keeping a good sleeping environment\n**Removing distractions such as television, computers, and other engaging activities<ref name=\"BBDinsomnia\"/>\n**Keeping the sleeping space dark and quiet<ref name=\"BBDinsomnia\"/>\n**Having a good bed<ref name=\"BBDinsomnia\"/>\n**Committing to a consistent bedtime<ref name=\"BBDinsomnia\"/>\n**Committing to a consistent wake-up time<ref name=\"BBDinsomnia\"/>\n**Avoiding staying in bed while awake for a longer time period than ideal for going to sleep.

People with insomnia are guided to do the following:\n* go to bed only when they are tired\n* limit activities in bed to sleep and sex\n* get out of bed at the same time every morning\n* get up and move to another room when sleep-onset does not occur within ten minutes\n\n===Sleep hygiene ===\n\n[[Sleep hygiene]] aims to control the environment and behaviors that precede sleep. This involves limiting substances that can interfere with proper sleep, particularly within 4\u20136 hours of going to bed. These substances include caffeine, nicotine and alcohol. Sometimes a light bedtime snack, such as milk or peanut butter, is recommended. The environment in which one sleeps, and the environment that directly precedes sleep, is also very important. Patients should engage in relaxing activities prior to going to bed, such as reading, writing, listening to calming music or taking a bath. Importantly, they should limit stimulating activity such as watching television, using a computer or being around bright lights.\n\n=== Sleep restriction therapy ===\n{{anchor|\"Sleep_restriction\"}}\n\nSleep restriction,<ref name=\"restriction\">{{cite journal |pmid=3563247 |year=1987 |last1=Spielman |first1=AJ |last2=Saskin |first2=P |last3=Thorpy |first3=MJ |title=Treatment of chronic insomnia by restriction of time in bed |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=45\u201356 |journal=Sleep}}</ref> also known as sleep restriction therapy, is probably the most difficult step of CBT-I. This is because CBT-I initially involves the restriction of sleep. Insomniacs typically spend a long time in bed not sleeping, which CBT-I sees as creating a mental association between the bed and insomnia. The bed therefore becomes a site of nightly frustration where it is difficult to relax. Although it is counter-intuitive, sleep restriction is a significant and effective component of CBT-I. It involves controlling time in bed (TIB) based upon the person's sleep efficiency in order to restore the [[homeostatic]] drive to sleep and thereby re-enforce the \"bed-sleep connection\".<ref name=FamilyPractice>{{cite journal|title=Teach Insomniacs That Beds Are for Sleeping|url=http://www.mdedge.com/familypracticenews/article/47384/pulmonology/teach-insomniacs-beds-are-sleeping|journal=Family Practice News|accessdate=28 December 2016|date=2012-02-07}}</ref> Sleep Efficiency (SE) is the measure of reported Total Sleep Time (TST), the actual amount of time the patient is usually able to sleep, compared with his or her TIB.\n\nSleep efficiency = (Total sleep time / Time in bed)\n\n* First, time in bed is restricted to some value, not less than 5 hours<ref name=FamilyPractice/>\n* Increase or decrease TIB weekly by only 20-30 min (or by 15 minutes every five days<ref name=FamilyPractice/>)\n* Increase TIB if SE >90% (or 85%<ref name=FamilyPractice/>)\n* Decrease TIB if SE <80% (or 85%)\n\nThis process may take several weeks or months to complete, depending on the person's initial sleep efficiency and how effective the treatment is for them individually. (According to one expert, this should result in getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep within about six weeks.<ref name=FamilyPractice/>) Daytime sleepiness is a side-effect during the first week or two of treatment, so those who operate heavy machinery or otherwise cannot safely be sleep deprived should not undergo this process.\n\nResearch has showed that sleep restriction therapy does create side effects such as \"fatigue/exhaustion\", \"extreme sleepiness\", \"reduced motivation/energy\", \"headache/migraine\", irritability, and changes in appetite. But the frequency and ratings of how much these side effects interfered were associated with improvement in sleep quality over the course of the treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kyle|first=Simon D.|last2=Morgan|first2=Kevin|last3=Spiegelhalder|first3=Kai|last4=Espie|first4=Colin A.|date=September 2011|title=No pain, no gain: An exploratory within-subjects mixed-methods evaluation of the patient experience of sleep restriction therapy (SRT) for insomnia|journal=Sleep Medicine|volume=12|issue=8|pages=735\u2013747|doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2011.03.016}}</ref> In another study, results of questionnaires measuring impairment through the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) were stabilized at a normal level at 3-months follow-up.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Christopher B.|last2=Espie|first2=Colin A.|last3=Epstein|first3=Dana R.|last4=Friedman|first4=Leah|last5=Morin|first5=Charles M.|last6=Pigeon|first6=Wilfred R.|last7=Spielman|first7=Arthur J.|last8=Kyle|first8=Simon D.|date=October 2014|title=The evidence base of sleep restriction therapy for treating insomnia disorder|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|volume=18|issue=5|pages=415\u2013424|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2014.01.006|pmid=24629826}}</ref>\n\nRestricting sleep has also been shown to be an effective but usually temporary measure for [[Sleep deprivation#Depression|treating depression]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sleep Deprivation For Depression: A Potent, Short-Term Treatment|url=http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/08/07/sleep-deprivation-for-depression-a-potent-short-term-treatment/|website=Mental Health Daily|accessdate=10 August 2016|date=2015-08-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Relaxation training ===\n\n[[Relaxation training]] is a collection of practices that can help people to relax throughout the day and particularly close to bedtime. It is useful for insomnia patients with difficulty falling asleep. However it is unclear whether or not it is useful for those who tend to wake up in the middle of the night or very early in the morning.  Techniques include hypnosis, [[guided imagery]] and meditation.\n\n===Cognitive therapy===\nCognitive therapy<ref name=\"review\" /><ref name=\"sivertsen\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.295.24.2851 |title=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy vs Zopiclone for Treatment of Chronic Primary Insomnia in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial |year=2006 |last1=Sivertsen |first1=B. |journal=JAMA |volume=295 |issue=24 |pages=2851\u20138 |pmid=16804151 |last2=Omvik |first2=S |last3=Pallesen |first3=S |last4=Bjorvatn |first4=B |last5=Havik |first5=OE |last6=Kvale |first6=G |last7=Nielsen |first7=GH |last8=Nordhus |first8=IH|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.brat.2007.04.007 |title=An open trial of cognitive therapy for chronic insomnia |year=2007 |last1=Harvey |first1=A |last2=Sharpley |first2=A |last3=Ree |first3=M |last4=Stinson |first4=K |last5=Clark |first5=D |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=45 |issue=10 |pages=2491\u2013501 |pmid=17583673}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0005-7967(01)00061-4 |title=A cognitive model of insomnia |year=2002 |last1=Harvey |first1=A.G |journal=Behaviour Research and Therapy |volume=40 |issue=8 |pages=869\u201393 |pmid=12186352}}</ref> within CBT-I is not synonymous with versions of [[Cognitive Behavioral Therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy]] that are not targeted at insomnia. When dealing with insomnia, cognitive therapy is mostly about offering education about sleep in order to target dysfunctional beliefs/attitudes about sleep.\n\nCognitive therapists will directly question the logical basis of these dysfunctional beliefs in order to point out their flaws. If applicable, the therapist will arrange a situation for the individual to test these flawed beliefs. For instance, many insomniacs believe that if they do not get enough sleep they will be tired the entire following day. They will then try to conserve energy by not moving around or by taking a nap. These responses are understandable but can exacerbate the problem, since they do not generate energy. If instead a person actively tries to generate energy by taking a walk, having an orgasm, taking a hit of crack, talking to a friend and getting plenty of sunlight, he or she may find that the original belief was self-fulfilling and not actually true.\n\nThe crucial messages that the therapist tries to communicate to the patient are the following:<ref>{{Cite book|title=wealth : psychological assessment and management|last=Morin, Charles M.|date=1993|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1572301201|oclc=455860736}}</ref>\n\n* Realistic expectations about sleep duration and the energy that the patient can expect the next day will help to manage the patient's dysfunctional thoughts about healthy sleep requirements.\n* Insomnia cannot be blamed for all the deficits the patient is experiencing in his daytime life (not all problems will go away once the patient is able to sleep), this is important to know, because it takes some of the unrealistic expectations off sleep. \n* It is not helpful to ''try'' to sleep - trying harder will only keep the patient more awake.\n* Sleep should not be given too much importance in the patient's life - it should not be the point around which the patient's life revolves.\n* Avoiding catastrophic thoughts after a night of unfulfilling sleep is key - Insomnia is unpleasant, but not detrimental to health (at least short-term) \n* Developing strategies to cope with recurring sleep problems may be helpful, since patients with insomnia are more likely to experience sleep disturbances in the future.\n\nWorry is a common factor of insomnia. Therapists will work to control worry and rumination with the use of a thought record, a log where a person writes down concerns. The therapist and the patient can then approach each of these concerns individually.\n\n=== Paradoxical Intention ===\nParadoxical Intention is a treatment method which involves telling the patient to do the exact opposite of what they have been doing in bed: They should stay awake and avoid falling asleep.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Hermann|first=Ernst|last2=Hermann|first2=Rebecca|date=2018|title=Schlaf-Wach-St\u00f6rungen|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323134534|journal=Lehrbuch der Verhaltenstherapie, Band 2|pages=185\u2013225}}</ref>  The goal of this method is to decrease performance anxiety which may inhibit sleep onset.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Morgenthaler|first=Timothy|date=2006|title=Practice Parameters for the Psychological and Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia: An Update.

Many people with PTSD relive or re-experience a traumatic event; memories of the event can appear at any time and the person feels the same fear/horror as when the event occurred. These can be either in the form of nightmares and/or flashbacks. Those with PTSD also experience hyperarousal ([[fight-or-flight]]) and can be too alert to go to sleep.<ref>PTSD: National Center for PTSD. (n.d.). Symptoms of PTSD -. Retrieved April 30, 2014, from http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/PTSD-overview/basics/symptoms_of_ptsd.asp</ref> Due to this, many experience some form of insomnia.\n\nRecent studies have shown that CBT-I offers some improvement for those suffering from PTSD.  For example, a study conducted in 2014 looked at whether CBT-I improved sleep in those with PTSD along with other PTSD related symptoms. The study showed improved sleep and improved psychosocial functioning.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=24497661 | doi=10.5665/sleep.3408 | volume=37 | issue=2 | title=Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized controlled trial | pmc=3900619 | year=2014 | journal=Sleep | pages=327\u201341 | last1 = Talbot | first1 = LS | last2 = Maguen | first2 = S | last3 = Metzler | first3 = TJ | last4 = Schmitz | first4 = M | last5 = McCaslin | first5 = SE | last6 = Richards | first6 = A | last7 = Perlis | first7 = ML | last8 = Posner | first8 = DA | last9 = Weiss | first9 = B | last10 = Ruoff | first10 = L | last11 = Varbel | first11 = J | last12 = Neylan | first12 = TC}}</ref>\n\nOther studies even suggest that CBT-I in combination with imagery rehearsal therapy helps improve sleep-related PTSD symptoms. Imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) is a modified cognitive behavioral therapy technique used to treat recurring nightmares.  This technique involves recalling the nightmare, writing it down, modifying parts of the dream to make it positive, and rehearsing the new dream to create a cognitive shift that counters the original dream.

Insomnia is a common problem involving trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or getting quality sleep. CBT-I aims to improve sleep habits and behaviors by identifying  and changing the thoughts and the behaviors that affect the ability of a person to sleep or sleep well.\n\nThe first step in treating insomnia with CBT-I is to identify the underlying causes of insomnia. People with insomnia should evaluate or have their sleep patterns evaluated and take into account all possible factors that may be affecting the person's ability to sleep. This would involve keeping a sleep diary or journal for a couple weeks. The journal will help to identify patterns of thoughts or behaviors, stressors, etc. that could be contributing to the person's insomnia.<ref>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia Part 1. (n.d.).

In CBT-I these steps include stimulus control, sleep hygiene, sleep restriction, relaxation training, and cognitive therapy. Some sleep specialists recommend [[biofeedback]] as well.<ref>Insomnia.

It is also effective in treatment of insomnia related to or caused by mood disorders.

This involves limiting substances that can interfere with proper sleep, particularly within 4\u20136 hours of going to bed. These substances include caffeine, nicotine and alcohol. Sometimes a light bedtime snack, such as milk or peanut butter, is recommended. The environment in which one sleeps, and the environment that directly precedes sleep, is also very important. Patients should engage in relaxing activities prior to going to bed, such as reading, writing, listening to calming music or taking a bath. Importantly, they should limit stimulating activity such as watching television, using a computer or being around bright lights.\n\n=== Sleep restriction therapy ===\n{{anchor|\"Sleep_restriction\"}}\n\nSleep restriction,<ref name=\"restriction\">{{cite journal |pmid=3563247 |year=1987 |last1=Spielman |first1=AJ |last2=Saskin |first2=P |last3=Thorpy |first3=MJ |title=Treatment of chronic insomnia by restriction of time in bed |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=45\u201356 |journal=Sleep}}</ref> also known as sleep restriction therapy, is probably the most difficult step of CBT-I. This is because CBT-I initially involves the restriction of sleep. Insomniacs typically spend a long time in bed not sleeping, which CBT-I sees as creating a mental association between the bed and insomnia. The bed therefore becomes a site of nightly frustration where it is difficult to relax. Although it is counter-intuitive, sleep restriction is a significant and effective component of CBT-I. It involves controlling time in bed (TIB) based upon the person's sleep efficiency in order to restore the [[homeostatic]] drive to sleep and thereby re-enforce the \"bed-sleep connection\".<ref name=FamilyPractice>{{cite journal|title=Teach Insomniacs That Beds Are for Sleeping|url=http://www.mdedge.com/familypracticenews/article/47384/pulmonology/teach-insomniacs-beds-are-sleeping|journal=Family Practice News|accessdate=28 December 2016|date=2012-02-07}}</ref> Sleep Efficiency (SE) is the measure of reported Total Sleep Time (TST), the actual amount of time the patient is usually able to sleep, compared with his or her TIB.\n\nSleep efficiency = (Total sleep time / Time in bed)\n\n* First, time in bed is restricted to some value, not less than 5 hours<ref name=FamilyPractice/>\n* Increase or decrease TIB weekly by only 20-30 min (or by 15 minutes every five days<ref name=FamilyPractice/>)\n* Increase TIB if SE >90% (or 85%<ref name=FamilyPractice/>)\n* Decrease TIB if SE <80% (or 85%)\n\nThis process may take several weeks or months to complete, depending on the person's initial sleep efficiency and how effective the treatment is for them individually. (According to one expert, this should result in getting 7 to 8 hours of sleep within about six weeks.<ref name=FamilyPractice/>) Daytime sleepiness is a side-effect during the first week or two of treatment, so those who operate heavy machinery or otherwise cannot safely be sleep deprived should not undergo this process.\n\nResearch has showed that sleep restriction therapy does create side effects such as \"fatigue/exhaustion\", \"extreme sleepiness\", \"reduced motivation/energy\", \"headache/migraine\", irritability, and changes in appetite. But the frequency and ratings of how much these side effects interfered were associated with improvement in sleep quality over the course of the treatment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kyle|first=Simon D.|last2=Morgan|first2=Kevin|last3=Spiegelhalder|first3=Kai|last4=Espie|first4=Colin A.|date=September 2011|title=No pain, no gain: An exploratory within-subjects mixed-methods evaluation of the patient experience of sleep restriction therapy (SRT) for insomnia|journal=Sleep Medicine|volume=12|issue=8|pages=735\u2013747|doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2011.03.016}}</ref> In another study, results of questionnaires measuring impairment through the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) and the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) were stabilized at a normal level at 3-months follow-up.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Christopher B.|last2=Espie|first2=Colin A.|last3=Epstein|first3=Dana R.|last4=Friedman|first4=Leah|last5=Morin|first5=Charles M.|last6=Pigeon|first6=Wilfred R.|last7=Spielman|first7=Arthur J.|last8=Kyle|first8=Simon D.|date=October 2014|title=The evidence base of sleep restriction therapy for treating insomnia disorder|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|volume=18|issue=5|pages=415\u2013424|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2014.01.006|pmid=24629826}}</ref>\n\nRestricting sleep has also been shown to be an effective but usually temporary measure for [[Sleep deprivation#Depression|treating depression]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sleep Deprivation For Depression: A Potent, Short-Term Treatment|url=http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/08/07/sleep-deprivation-for-depression-a-potent-short-term-treatment/|website=Mental Health Daily|accessdate=10 August 2016|date=2015-08-07}}</ref>\n\n=== Relaxation training ===\n\n[[Relaxation training]] is a collection of practices that can help people to relax throughout the day and particularly close to bedtime.

When dealing with insomnia, cognitive therapy is mostly about offering education about sleep in order to target dysfunctional beliefs/attitudes about sleep.\n\nCognitive therapists will directly question the logical basis of these dysfunctional beliefs in order to point out their flaws. If applicable, the therapist will arrange a situation for the individual to test these flawed beliefs. For instance, many insomniacs believe that if they do not get enough sleep they will be tired the entire following day. They will then try to conserve energy by not moving around or by taking a nap. These responses are understandable but can exacerbate the problem, since they do not generate energy. If instead a person actively tries to generate energy by taking a walk, talking to a friend and getting plenty of sunlight, he or she may find that the original belief was self-fulfilling and not actually true.\n\nThe crucial messages that the therapist tries to communicate to the patient are the following:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Insomnia : psychological assessment and management|last=Morin, Charles M.|date=1993|publisher=Guilford Press|isbn=1572301201|oclc=455860736}}</ref>\n\n* Realistic expectations about sleep duration and the energy that the patient can expect the next day will help to manage the patient's dysfunctional thoughts about healthy sleep requirements.\n* Insomnia cannot be blamed for all the deficits the patient is experiencing in his daytime life (not all problems will go away once the patient is able to sleep), this is important to know, because it takes some of the unrealistic expectations off sleep. \n* It is not helpful to ''try'' to sleep - trying harder will only keep the patient more awake.\n* Sleep should not be given too much importance in the patient's life - it should not be the point around which the patient's life revolves.\n* Avoiding catastrophic thoughts after a night of unfulfilling sleep is key - Insomnia is unpleasant, but not detrimental to health (at least short-term) \n* Developing strategies to cope with recurring sleep problems may be helpful, since patients with insomnia are more likely to experience sleep disturbances in the future.\n\nWorry is a common factor of insomnia.

Many people with PTSD relive or re-experience a traumatic event; memories of the event can appear at any time and the person feels the same fear/horror as when the event occurred. These can be either in the form of nightmares and/or flashbacks. Those with PTSD also experience hyperarousal ([[fight-or-flight]]) and can be too alert to go to sleep.<ref>PTSD: National Center for PTSD. (n.d.). Symptoms of PTSD -. Retrieved April 30, 2014, from http://www.ptsd.va.gov/public/PTSD-overview/basics/symptoms_of_ptsd.asp</ref> Due to this, many experience some form of insomnia.\n\nRecent studies have shown that CBT-I offers some improvement for those suffering from PTSD.  For example, a study conducted in 2014 looked at whether CBT-I improved sleep in those with PTSD along with other PTSD related symptoms. The study showed improved sleep and improved psychosocial functioning.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=24497661 | doi=10.5665/sleep.3408 | volume=37 | issue=2 | title=Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized controlled trial | pmc=3900619 | year=2014 | journal=Sleep | pages=327\u201341 | last1 = Talbot | first1 = LS | last2 = Maguen | first2 = S | last3 = Metzler | first3 = TJ | last4 = Schmitz | first4 = M | last5 = McCaslin | first5 = SE | last6 = Richards | first6 = A | last7 = Perlis | first7 = ML | last8 = Posner | first8 = DA | last9 = Weiss | first9 = B | last10 = Ruoff | first10 = L | last11 = Varbel | first11 = J | last12 = Neylan | first12 = TC}}</ref>\n\nOther studies even suggest that CBT-I in combination with imagery rehearsal therapy helps improve sleep-related PTSD symptoms. Imagery rehearsal therapy (IRT) is a modified cognitive behavioral therapy technique used to treat recurring nightmares.  This technique involves recalling the nightmare, writing it down, modifying parts of the dream to make it positive, and rehearsing the new dream to create a cognitive shift that counters the original dream. IRT can be used for anyone suffering from recurring nightmares.<ref>{{cite journal | year = | title = Best Practice for the Treatment of Nightmare Disorder in Adults | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 395 }}</ref>\n\n== Application to other conditions ==\nIndividuals with cancer often suffer from insomnia due to psychological, behavioral or physical consequences of cancer diagnosis and treatment.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Garland|first=Sheila|date=2014|title=Sleeping well with cancer: a systematic review of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia in cancer patients|journal=Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment|volume=10|pages=1113}}</ref> CBT-I has been shown to be an effective treatment in such individuals.<ref name=\":7\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Jillian A.|date=2016|title=A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in cancer survivors|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|volume=27|pages=20\u201328|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2015.07.001|pmid=26434673}}</ref> Furthermore, it may also improve their mood, fatigue and overall quality of life.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nCBT-I can also be applied to patients suffering from both chronic pain and insomnia.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Jungquist|first=Carla R.|date=2010|title=The efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia in patients with chronic pain|journal=Sleep Medicine|volume=11|issue=3|pages=302\u2013209|doi=10.1016/j.sleep.2009.05.018|pmid=20133188|pmc=2830371}}</ref> Chronic pain can directly contribute to the difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep via hyperarousal due to the experienced pain.<ref name=\":8\" /> CBT-I has been shown to improve sleep continuity and reduce impairment in daily functioning due to pain in such individuals.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nCBT-I has been shown to be effective in geriatric patients with insomnia as well.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Chand|first=S.P.|date=2013|title=How to adapt cognitive-behavioral therapy for older adults.|journal=Current Psychiatry|volume=12|issue=3|pages=10\u201315}}</ref> Medication might be problematic in such patients and they might prefer psychotherapy over medication.<ref name=\":6\" /> Therefore, it should be considered as a treatment option for them.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Efficacy==\n\n* Patients who have undergone CBT-I spend more time in sleep stages three and four (also known as [[slow-wave sleep]], delta sleep or deep sleep) and less time awake than those treated with [[zopiclone]] (also known as Imovane or Zimovane).

Others in the industry blame arguments, artistic differences and the ultimate loss of Neil Diamond, who was Bang's biggest artist. Diamond has said his departure from Bang had been over his direction as an artist, and away from his early \"teenybopper\" type of recordings that Berns favored, which led to his refusal to release the more introspective \"[[Shilo (song)|Shilo]]\" as a single, even though Diamond felt it was part of his development as an artist. Shortly after what was said to be a \"tense\" confrontation with Berns, Diamond departed Bang for Uni/MCA Records in 1968. By 1970, a few years after Berns' death, Diamond had racked up a few hits on the [[Uni Records|Uni]] subsidiary of [[MCA Records|MCA]]. That year Bang finally released \"Shilo\" as a single, which promptly hit the Top 40 charts. Berns' young widow signed singer/songwriter [[Paul Davis (singer)|Paul Davis]], who had a number of hit records in the 1970s and 1980s, including \"Ride 'Em Cowboy\", \"I Go Crazy\", \"Sweet Life\" and \"Do Right\". Ilene Berns also signed and developed [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] acts [[Brick (band)|Brick]] (\"[[Dazz (song)|Dazz]]\") and [[Peabo Bryson]]. Also in 1970 she hired promotion man Eddie Biscoe to help run Bang. They eventually married.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awkEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1974-05-25|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Development of the label==\nIn 1971 Ilene moved Bang's base of operations from New York City to [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_rg4EAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1998-04-11|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> In the early years Bang did its own distribution. \nIn [[1979 in music|1979]] Bang was sold to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_rg4EAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1998-04-11|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSUEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1979-02-17|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> and kept its identity as part of the CBS Associated unit until it was absorbed in 1982 by CBS' [[Columbia Records]] unit. Over the years two subsidiary labels were started: [[Shout Records]] and [[Bullet Records]]. While Sony Music owns the Bang Records catalog today, the Berns family still owns the music publishing operations. In [[1979 in music|1979]] Columbia Records turned over control of Diamond's Bang master recordings to the artist himself, at the time one of the label's hottest stars, who has remixed and re-released them several times over the years.

Others in the industry blame arguments, artistic differences and the ultimate loss of Neil Diamond, who was Bang's biggest artist. Diamond has said his departure from Bang had been over his direction as an artist, and away from his early \"teenybopper\" type of recordings that Berns favored, which led to his refusal to release the more introspective \"[[Shilo (song)|Shilo]]\" as a single, even though Diamond felt it was part of his development as an artist. Shortly after what was said to be a \"tense\" confrontation with Berns, Diamond departed Bang for Uni/MCA Records in 1968. By 1970, a few years after Berns' death, Diamond had racked up a few hits on the [[Uni Records|Uni]] subsidiary of [[MCA Records|MCA]]. That year Bang finally released \"Shilo\" as a single, which promptly hit the Top 40 charts. Berns' young widow signed singer/songwriter [[Paul Davis (singer)|Paul Davis]], who had a number of hit records in the 1970s and 1980s, including \"Ride 'Em Cowboy\", \"I Go Crazy\", \"Sweet Life\" and \"Do Right\". Ilene Berns also signed and developed [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] acts [[Brick (band)|Brick]] (\"[[Dazz (song)|Dazz]]\") and [[Peabo Bryson]]. Also in 1970 she hired promotion man Eddie Biscoe to help run Bang. They eventually married.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=awkEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1974-05-25|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Development of the label==\nIn 1971 Ilene moved Bang's base of operations from New York City to [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_rg4EAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1998-04-11|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> In the early years Bang did its own distribution. \nIn [[1979 in music|1979]] Bang was sold to [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]],<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_rg4EAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1998-04-11|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LSUEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1979-02-17|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> and kept its identity as part of the CBS Associated unit until it was absorbed in 1982 by CBS' [[Columbia Records]] unit. Over the years two subsidiary labels were started: [[Shout Records]] and [[Bullet Records]]. While Sony Music owns the Bang Records catalog today, the Berns family still owns the music publishing operations. In [[1979 in music|1979]] Columbia Records turned over control of Diamond's Bang master recordings to the artist himself, at the time one of the label's hottest stars, who has remixed and re-released them several times over the years.

He is also a ballbag \n\n== Early life ==\nNeil Druckmann was born in [[Israel]] on December 5, 1978,<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/><ref name=\"ETC\"/><ref name=\"Creative\"/> to Yehudit \"Judy\" and Jerry Ilan Druckmann.<ref name=\"Israel\"/><ref name=\"Ynet parents\"/> At a young age, Druckmann's older brother Emanuel showed him comic books, video games, and movies.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> These forms of entertainment, particularly video games by [[Sierra Entertainment]] and [[LucasArts]],<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/> helped Druckmann learn English.<ref name=\"ETC\"/> Druckmann became particularly interested in storytelling, and wrote his own comic books.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> He moved to the United States with his family in 1989.<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/> He attended middle school and high school in [[Miami, Florida]], then studied criminology at the [[University of Florida]].<ref name=\"Creative\"/> His brother sneaked him into the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] in the late 1990s.<ref name=\"Brother E3\"/> Druckmann worked as a clerk at [[My Favorite Muffin]] and as a sales person at [[PacSun]].<ref name=\"Twitter Jobs\"/>\n\nDruckmann soon became a graphics research assistant at [[Florida State University]], while living in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].<ref name=\"CMU bio\"/><ref name=\"Twitter Jobs\"/> He spent a year at the university working at the Visualization Lab<ref name=\"CMU work\"/> within the School of Computational Science and Information Technology, beginning in July 2002. During this time, he began developing the game ''Pink-Bullet'', for [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]], with some friends.<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> At one point, he wanted to be an animator, which required enlisting in art classes, but his parents forbade him from doing so.<ref name=\"Newsarama\"/> After taking a programming class, Druckmann realized that it was his preference,<ref name=\"Creative\"/> and began a [[Bachelor of Computer Science]] in December 2002, which he completed the following year.<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> Druckmann moved to [[Pittsburgh]], where he attended [[Carnegie Mellon University]];<ref name=\"Creative\"/> in August 2003, he began his Master's degree in Entertainment Technology,<ref name=\"FSU resume\"/> which he earned in 2005<ref name=\"Creative\"/> from the [[Entertainment Technology Center]].<ref name=\"Edge\"/> In April 2004, Druckmann developed the game ''Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] as a student at Carnegie Mellon, in collaboration with fellow student Allan Blomquist.<ref name=\"Dikki Painguin\"/><ref name=\"Dikki Painguin 2\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAt the [[Game Developers Conference]], Druckmann met [[Naughty Dog]] co-founder [[Jason Rubin]]. After Druckmann \"bugged\" Rubin, the latter gave him his business card.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> In 2004, Druckmann joined Naughty Dog as a programming intern, before being promoted to a full-time position as a gameplay programmer a few months later.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> During the development of ''[[Jak 3]]'' (2004) and ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'' (2005), Druckmann continued to ask co-president Evan Wells about joining the design team. Wells restrained from moving him to the design team, as he was originally employed as a programmer, but agreed to review Druckmann's design work if he completed them after working hours. Following the development of ''Jak X'', Wells concluded that Druckmann was skilled in the field of design, and gave him the role of game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> In this position, he worked closely with [[Amy Hennig]] to construct the story of ''Uncharted'', before working on ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' (2009) as a lead game designer, becoming more involved with the core writing of the game.<ref name=\"Creative\"/><ref name=\"Edge\"/> Druckmann also worked on the original design and story of ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' (2009), prior to Naughty Dog's abandonment of the game; [[High Impact Games]] completed development.<ref name=\"Frontier\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Druckmann worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', as writer and director. A prequel to ''Drake's Fortune'', ''Eye of Indra'' tells the story of [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]] prior to the events of the first game.<ref name=\"Indra\"/> Druckmann's first [[graphic novel]], ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]'', was published by Ape Entertainment in February 2010.<ref name=\"ASCAS2\"/> With illustrations by artist Joysuke Wong, the novel relates Druckmann's interest in traveling back in time to meet his wife at a younger age. \"There's something cute and poetic about that idea,\" Druckmann explained.<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> He felt that he shares many similarities with the novel's protagonist Johnny, and that \"a lot of Johnny's flaws and fears are based on [his] own shortcomings\".<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> The comic was originally released on February 24, 2010;<ref name=\"ASCAS3\"/> critics particularly praised Wong's illustrations, as well as Druckmann's writing and character development.<ref name=\"ASCAS4\"/>\n\nFollowing the development of ''Uncharted 2'', Naughty Dog split into two teams to work on projects concurrently. With one team working on ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'' (2011), co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra chose Druckmann and [[Bruce Straley]] to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on a new game; Druckmann was chosen for his determination and talent for design.<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> Though they were originally set to develop a new game in the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series, the team felt that they \"weren't doing service to the fans of [the] franchise\", and decided to create a new [[Intellectual property|game]], titled ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref name=\"Jak 4\"/>\n\n[[File:Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, PAX Prime 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Druckmann (right) with game director [[Bruce Straley]] (left) at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX Prime]] 2014. The two worked closely throughout the development of ''The Last of Us'' and ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''.|alt=A man with short brown hair, sitting next to a man with curly black hair hugging a plush giraffe, both smiling at something to the right of the camera.]]\n\nWhen conceiving ideas for ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann used a concept that he created as a student at Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the gameplay of ''[[Ico]]'' (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), with a lead character similar to [[John Hartigan]] from ''[[Sin City]]'' (1991\u20132000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to his heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based ''The Last of Us'' on this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]].<ref name=\"failure\"/> Druckmann wrote ''The Last of Us'' with the intention of having the story \"rooted firmly within reality\", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous \"light and loose\" feeling. \"It needed to go a little darker [than ''Uncharted''] to explore a sadder theme,\" he explained.<ref name=\"OPM Look Back\"/> Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to \"talk to [the actors] in the same language\".<ref name=\"Edge\"/> The game was released on June 14, 2013, with praise for Druckmann's work on the story.<ref name=\"TLOU Roundup\"/> He earned numerous awards, including a [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> a [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Award]],<ref name=\"DICE\"/> a [[Game Developers Choice Awards|Game Developers Choice Award]],<ref name=\"GDCA\"/> a [[Golden Joystick Awards|Golden Joystick Award]],<ref name=\"CVG_2013\"/> and a [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]].<ref name=\"WGAA\"/>\n\nDruckmann later worked on the [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] [[expansion pack]] ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'', a prequel focusing on Ellie's relationship with her friend Riley,<ref name=\"TLOULB\"/> which received critical acclaim.<ref name=\"VG247\"/> He earned additional accolades for his work on ''Left Behind'', including a second BAFTA<ref name=\"BAFTA15\"/> and Writers Guild of America Award.<ref name=\"WGAA15\"/> In particular, he was praised for writing a scene involving a kiss between two female characters, which was named a \"breakthrough moment\" for video games.<ref name=\"Kotaku breakthrough\"/> He also co-wrote the four-issue comic book miniseries ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'', with writer and artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]]. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], with the first issue released in April 2013,<ref name=\"TLOUAD\"/> and was lauded for Druckmann's writing and character development, as well as Hicks' simplistic illustrations.<ref name=\"TLOUAD BD\"/><ref name=\"TLOUAD IGN\"/>\n\nFollowing Hennig's departure from Naughty Dog in March 2014, it was announced that Druckmann and Straley were working on ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'' (2016) as creative director and game director respectively.<ref name=\"UC4\"/> Initial reports claimed that Hennig was \"forced out\" of Naughty Dog by Druckmann and Straley, though co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra later denied this.<ref name=\"Hennig\"/> Druckmann co-wrote the story alongside Josh Scherr;<ref name=\"U4 Ending\"/> Druckmann considered Scherr the \"funny one\", allowing him to write the humour of ''Uncharted 4'' due to Druckmann's self-professed inability to write jokes. He appreciated the collaboration of writing on ''Uncharted 4'', having written ''The Last of Us'' almost entirely independently.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> The game was released on May 10, 2016 to and praised for its story.<ref name=\"U4 Roundup\"/> It was awarded Best Narrative at [[The Game Awards 2016]],<ref name=\"Game Awards\"/> and Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2016|69th Writers Guild of America Awards]].<ref name=\"WGAA17\"/> Druckmann acted as head of narrative development for ''[[Uncharted: The Lost Legacy]]'', released in August 2017.<ref name=\"UCLL\"/>\n\nIn March 2014, Sony announced that Druckmann was writing a film adaptation of ''The Last of Us'', produced by [[Sam Raimi]] and distributed by [[Screen Gems]].<ref name=\"IGN Movie\"/> By January 2015, he had written the script's second draft, and performed a [[read-through]] with some actors.<ref name=\"IGN Movie2\"/> Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered [[development hell]],<ref name=\"IGN Movie3\"/> and in February 2018 said \"I don't want that movie to be made.\"<ref name=\"DoG Movie\"/> Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled ''The Last of Us Part II'', alongside Halley Gross;<ref name=\"Gross\"/> Straley will not return to co-direct the game.<ref name=\"TLOU2 Straley\"/> Druckmann worked as a playtester for ''[[What Remains of Edith Finch]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Edith Finch\"/> In August 2017, he was featured as a guest judge on an episode of ''[[Face Off (TV series)|Face Off]]''.<ref name=\"Face Off\"/> Druckmann was promoted to Vice President of Naughty Dog in March 2018.<ref name=\"VP\"/>\n\nDruckmann is acting as a writer and executive producer on a television adaptation of ''The Last of Us'' for [[HBO]], expected to cover events of this game and possibly some parts of its sequel.<ref name=\"TLOU HBO\"/>\n\n== Writing style ==\nDruckmann's writing philosophy, which he realized while talking to game designer [[Cory Barlog]], is \"simple story, complex characters\"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting to enter the mindset of each one. He tries to ignore character [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s in an attempt to write \"honestly\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/> Druckmann also writes with a minimalist mindset, often asking himself \"What is this scene really about? What's the least we have to say or do to convey that and no more?\"<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/>\n\nBefore writing a game, Druckmann and Straley create an entire outline of the story, before exploring the narrative more intricately, discussing the \"moment-to-moment beats\" of each level that lead to a bigger event. They generally begin with the middle of the story, as it is the core of the gameplay and narrative, before exploring the game's climax and character development.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> ''The Frame'' host John Horn identified a repeating theme in Druckmann's stories, including ''A Second Chance at Sarah'' and ''The Last of Us'', is the concept of characters attempting or hoping to alter their past in some way; Druckmann admitted he had not noticed this trend, though agreed with it and recognized its recurrence in an upcoming story of his.<ref name=\"DoG Time\"/><ref name=\"SCPR\"/>\n\n== Influences ==\nDruckmann cites game writer [[Sam Lake]] as a large inspiration, naming himself a \"longtime fan\".<ref name=\"Sam Lake\"/> Druckmann's favorite video games include ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'' (1991), ''Ico'', and ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005),<ref name=\"Reddit games\"/> and he is often inspired by character-focused comics such as ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' (1995\u20132000), and ''[[Y: The Last Man]]'' (2002\u20132008).<ref name=\"SCPR\"/> Druckmann was also influenced by the character-driven storytelling in the [[adventure game]] ''[[King's Quest]]'' by [[Roberta Williams]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ken and Roberta Williams (Sierra) - The Game Awards 2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JQkRp-VFXQ |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=Gamerview |accessdate=12 May 2019 |date=6 December 2014}}</ref> While writing ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann was inspired by several films, including: ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992), for its ability to make audiences support the protagonist despite his immorality; ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007), due to its subtle and sparse execution, forcing audience engagement;<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/> and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013), in regards to simplicity and intensity.<ref name=\"Best Film\"/>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=\"While working on ''The Last of Us'' ...

Druckmann is proud that Ellie is a \"strong, non-sexualized female lead character\", and hoped that other developers would take similar approaches to characters without fear of unpopularity.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> Druckmann and Straley were surprised by some of the backlash in regards to gender roles in ''The Last of Us'', although Druckmann noted that \"the more progress we make, the more those problems stand out\".<ref name=\"Backlash\"/> He declared it a \"misconception\" that female protagonists hinder game sales,<ref name=\"TLOU Cover\"/> evidenced by the success of ''The Last of Us''.<ref name=\"Backlash\"/>\n\n== Personal life ==\nDruckmann currently resides in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] with his wife Maya<ref name=\"WGA\"/> and children.<ref name=\"failure\"/><ref name=\"Disaster\"/><ref name=\"Blogcast\"/> He became a father during the development of ''The Last of Us'';<ref name=\"failure\"/> his daughter was a \"huge inspiration\" to him when writing the game.<ref name=\"Reddit daughter\"/> He found that the birth of his daughter reinforced his ideas about family, realizing he would \"do anything\" for her.<ref name=\"SCPR\"/> Druckmann plays video games with his children, citing ''[[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]'' (2020) and the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series.<ref name=\"Blogcast\"/> On his first day as director on ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann suffered from [[headache]]s and began [[Diplopia|seeing double]]; he discovered the following day that he required emergency eye surgery, as an infection threatened his vision in his left eye.<ref name=\"Retro Replay\"/> Druckmann is [[Judaism|Jewish]], although found he regularly writes about \"[[White people|white]], [[Heterosexual|straight]], [[Christianity|Christian]] male\" characters, encouraging him to instead create more diverse characters.<ref name=\"SCPR\"/>\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Video games ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0;\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Year !! scope=\"col\"| Game title !! scope=\"col\"| Role\n|-\n| 2004 || ''Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Dikki Painguin\"/>\n|-\n| 2004 || ''[[Jak 3]]'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Creative\"/>\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Creative\"/>\n|-\n| 2007 || ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' || Game designer, co-writer<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/>\n|-\n| 2009 || ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' || Co-lead game designer, co-writer<ref name=\"Edge\"/>\n|-\n| 2009 || ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' || Original design and story<ref name=\"Frontier\">{{cite video game |title=''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' |developer=[[High Impact Games]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=November 3, 2009 |platform=[[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]] |version=1.0 |scene=Credits }}</ref>\n|-\n| 2013 || ''[[The Last of Us]]'' || Creative director, writer<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/>\n|-\n| 2014 || ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'' || Creative director, writer<ref name=\"TLOULB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-last-of-us-developers-talk-left-behind-dlc-spo/2300-6417282/ |title=The Last of Us Developers Talk Left Behind DLC [SPOILERS] |last=Jayne |first=Jeremy |publisher=[[GameSpot]].

Wells restrained from moving him to the design team, as he was originally employed as a programmer, but agreed to review Druckmann's design work if he completed them after working hours. Following the development of ''Jak X'', Wells concluded that Druckmann was skilled in the field of design, and gave him the role of game designer for ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' (2007).<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> In this position, he worked closely with [[Amy Hennig]] to construct the story of ''Uncharted'', before working on ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' (2009) as a lead game designer, becoming more involved with the core writing of the game.<ref name=\"Creative\"/><ref name=\"Edge\"/> Druckmann also worked on the original design and story of ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' (2009), prior to Naughty Dog's abandonment of the game; [[High Impact Games]] completed development.<ref name=\"Frontier\"/>\n\nIn 2009, Druckmann worked on the motion comic ''[[Uncharted: Eye of Indra]]'', as writer and director. A prequel to ''Drake's Fortune'', ''Eye of Indra'' tells the story of [[Nathan Drake (character)|Nathan Drake]] prior to the events of the first game.<ref name=\"Indra\"/> Druckmann's first [[graphic novel]], ''[[A Second Chance at Sarah]]'', was published by Ape Entertainment in February 2010.<ref name=\"ASCAS2\"/> With illustrations by artist Joysuke Wong, the novel relates Druckmann's interest in traveling back in time to meet his wife at a younger age. \"There's something cute and poetic about that idea,\" Druckmann explained.<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> He felt that he shares many similarities with the novel's protagonist Johnny, and that \"a lot of Johnny's flaws and fears are based on [his] own shortcomings\".<ref name=\"ASCAS\"/> The comic was originally released on February 24, 2010;<ref name=\"ASCAS3\"/> critics particularly praised Wong's illustrations, as well as Druckmann's writing and character development.<ref name=\"ASCAS4\"/>\n\nFollowing the development of ''Uncharted 2'', Naughty Dog split into two teams to work on projects concurrently. With one team working on ''[[Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception]]'' (2011), co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra chose Druckmann and [[Bruce Straley]] to lead [[Development of The Last of Us|development]] on a new game; Druckmann was chosen for his determination and talent for design.<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/> Though they were originally set to develop a new game in the ''[[Jak and Daxter]]'' series, the team felt that they \"weren't doing service to the fans of [the] franchise\", and decided to create a new [[Intellectual property|game]], titled ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref name=\"Jak 4\"/>\n\n[[File:Bruce Straley and Neil Druckmann, PAX Prime 2014.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Druckmann (right) with game director [[Bruce Straley]] (left) at [[Penny Arcade Expo|PAX Prime]] 2014. The two worked closely throughout the development of ''The Last of Us'' and ''Uncharted 4: A Thief's End''.|alt=A man with short brown hair, sitting next to a man with curly black hair hugging a plush giraffe, both smiling at something to the right of the camera.]]\n\nWhen conceiving ideas for ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann used a concept that he created as a student at Carnegie Mellon University. His idea was to merge the gameplay of ''[[Ico]]'' (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), with a lead character similar to [[John Hartigan]] from ''[[Sin City]]'' (1991\u20132000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to his heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. He based ''The Last of Us'' on this concept, replacing the police officer with Joel, and naming the young girl [[Ellie (The Last of Us)|Ellie]].<ref name=\"failure\"/> Druckmann wrote ''The Last of Us'' with the intention of having the story \"rooted firmly within reality\", a stark departure from Naughty Dog's previous \"light and loose\" feeling. \"It needed to go a little darker [than ''Uncharted''] to explore a sadder theme,\" he explained.<ref name=\"OPM Look Back\"/> Prior to directing the game, Druckmann took acting classes in order to \"talk to [the actors] in the same language\".<ref name=\"Edge\"/> The game was released on June 14, 2013, with praise for Druckmann's work on the story.<ref name=\"TLOU Roundup\"/> He earned numerous awards, including a [[British Academy Video Games Awards|BAFTA]],<ref name=\"BAFTA\"/> a [[Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences|DICE Award]],<ref name=\"DICE\"/> a [[Game Developers Choice Awards|Game Developers Choice Award]],<ref name=\"GDCA\"/> a [[Golden Joystick Awards|Golden Joystick Award]],<ref name=\"CVG_2013\"/> and a [[Writers Guild of America Awards|Writers Guild of America Award]].<ref name=\"WGAA\"/>\n\nDruckmann later worked on the [[Downloadable content|downloadable]] [[expansion pack]] ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'', a prequel focusing on Ellie's relationship with her friend Riley,<ref name=\"TLOULB\"/> which received critical acclaim.<ref name=\"VG247\"/> He earned additional accolades for his work on ''Left Behind'', including a second BAFTA<ref name=\"BAFTA15\"/> and Writers Guild of America Award.<ref name=\"WGAA15\"/> In particular, he was praised for writing a scene involving a kiss between two female characters, which was named a \"breakthrough moment\" for video games.<ref name=\"Kotaku breakthrough\"/> He also co-wrote the four-issue comic book miniseries ''[[The Last of Us: American Dreams]]'', with writer and artist [[Faith Erin Hicks]]. It was published by [[Dark Horse Comics]], with the first issue released in April 2013,<ref name=\"TLOUAD\"/> and was lauded for Druckmann's writing and character development, as well as Hicks' simplistic illustrations.<ref name=\"TLOUAD BD\"/><ref name=\"TLOUAD IGN\"/>\n\nFollowing Hennig's departure from Naughty Dog in March 2014, it was announced that Druckmann and Straley were working on ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'' (2016) as creative director and game director respectively.<ref name=\"UC4\"/> Initial reports claimed that Hennig was \"forced out\" of Naughty Dog by Druckmann and Straley, though co-presidents Evan Wells and Christophe Balestra later denied this.<ref name=\"Hennig\"/> Druckmann co-wrote the story alongside Josh Scherr;<ref name=\"U4 Ending\"/> Druckmann considered Scherr the \"funny one\", allowing him to write the humour of ''Uncharted 4'' due to Druckmann's self-professed inability to write jokes. He appreciated the collaboration of writing on ''Uncharted 4'', having written ''The Last of Us'' almost entirely independently.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> The game was released on May 10, 2016 to and praised for its story.<ref name=\"U4 Roundup\"/> It was awarded Best Narrative at [[The Game Awards 2016]],<ref name=\"Game Awards\"/> and Outstanding Achievement in Videogame Writing at the [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2016|69th Writers Guild of America Awards]].<ref name=\"WGAA17\"/> Druckmann acted as head of narrative development for ''[[Uncharted: The Lost Legacy]]'', released in August 2017.<ref name=\"UCLL\"/>\n\nIn March 2014, Sony announced that Druckmann was writing a film adaptation of ''The Last of Us'', produced by [[Sam Raimi]] and distributed by [[Screen Gems]].<ref name=\"IGN Movie\"/> By January 2015, he had written the script's second draft, and performed a [[read-through]] with some actors.<ref name=\"IGN Movie2\"/> Very little work occurred following this, as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered [[development hell]],<ref name=\"IGN Movie3\"/> and in February 2018 said \"I don't want that movie to be made.\"<ref name=\"DoG Movie\"/> Druckmann is currently co-writing a sequel to the first game, titled ''The Last of Us Part II'', alongside Halley Gross;<ref name=\"Gross\"/> Straley will not return to co-direct the game.<ref name=\"TLOU2 Straley\"/> Druckmann worked as a playtester for ''[[What Remains of Edith Finch]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"Edith Finch\"/> In August 2017, he was featured as a guest judge on an episode of ''[[Face Off (TV series)|Face Off]]''.<ref name=\"Face Off\"/> Druckmann was promoted to Vice President of Naughty Dog in March 2018.<ref name=\"VP\"/>\n\nDruckmann is acting as a writer and executive producer on a television adaptation of ''The Last of Us'' for [[HBO]], expected to cover events of this game and possibly some parts of its sequel.<ref name=\"TLOU HBO\"/>\n\n== Writing style ==\nDruckmann's writing philosophy, which he realized while talking to game designer [[Cory Barlog]], is \"simple story, complex characters\"; Druckmann dislikes video games with complicated exposition, but enjoys writing complex character relationships.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> Throughout his writing, Druckmann approaches scenes with focus on every character, attempting to enter the mindset of each one. He tries to ignore character [[Trope (literature)|trope]]s in an attempt to write \"honestly\".<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/> Druckmann also writes with a minimalist mindset, often asking himself \"What is this scene really about? What's the least we have to say or do to convey that and no more?\"<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/>\n\nBefore writing a game, Druckmann and Straley create an entire outline of the story, before exploring the narrative more intricately, discussing the \"moment-to-moment beats\" of each level that lead to a bigger event. They generally begin with the middle of the story, as it is the core of the gameplay and narrative, before exploring the game's climax and character development.<ref name=\"GameInformer Challenges\"/> ''The Frame'' host John Horn identified a repeating theme in Druckmann's stories, including ''A Second Chance at Sarah'' and ''The Last of Us'', is the concept of characters attempting or hoping to alter their past in some way; Druckmann admitted he had not noticed this trend, though agreed with it and recognized its recurrence in an upcoming story of his.<ref name=\"DoG Time\"/><ref name=\"SCPR\"/>\n\n== Influences ==\nDruckmann cites game writer [[Sam Lake]] as a large inspiration, naming himself a \"longtime fan\".<ref name=\"Sam Lake\"/> Druckmann's favorite video games include ''[[Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge]]'' (1991), ''Ico'', and ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' (2005),<ref name=\"Reddit games\"/> and he is often inspired by character-focused comics such as ''[[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]]'' (1995\u20132000), and ''[[Y: The Last Man]]'' (2002\u20132008).<ref name=\"SCPR\"/> Druckmann was also influenced by the character-driven storytelling in the [[adventure game]] ''[[King's Quest]]'' by [[Roberta Williams]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Ken and Roberta Williams (Sierra) - The Game Awards 2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JQkRp-VFXQ |website=[[YouTube]] |publisher=Gamerview |accessdate=12 May 2019 |date=6 December 2014}}</ref> While writing ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann was inspired by several films, including: ''[[Unforgiven]]'' (1992), for its ability to make audiences support the protagonist despite his immorality; ''[[No Country for Old Men (film)|No Country for Old Men]]'' (2007), due to its subtle and sparse execution, forcing audience engagement;<ref name=\"GameSpot Storytelling\"/> and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013), in regards to simplicity and intensity.<ref name=\"Best Film\"/>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote box|align=right|width=30em|quote=\"While working on ''The Last of Us'' ...

Druckmann is proud that Ellie is a \"strong, non-sexualized female lead character\", and hoped that other developers would take similar approaches to characters without fear of unpopularity.<ref name=\"Creative\"/> Druckmann and Straley were surprised by some of the backlash in regards to gender roles in ''The Last of Us'', although Druckmann noted that \"the more progress we make, the more those problems stand out\".<ref name=\"Backlash\"/> He declared it a \"misconception\" that female protagonists hinder game sales,<ref name=\"TLOU Cover\"/> evidenced by the success of ''The Last of Us''.<ref name=\"Backlash\"/>\n\n== Personal life ==\nDruckmann currently resides in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] with his wife Maya<ref name=\"WGA\"/> and children.<ref name=\"failure\"/><ref name=\"Disaster\"/><ref name=\"Blogcast\"/> He became a father during the development of ''The Last of Us'';<ref name=\"failure\"/> his daughter was a \"huge inspiration\" to him when writing the game.<ref name=\"Reddit daughter\"/> He found that the birth of his daughter reinforced his ideas about family, realizing he would \"do anything\" for her.<ref name=\"SCPR\"/> Druckmann plays video games with his children, citing ''[[Animal Crossing: New Horizons]]'' (2020) and the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series.<ref name=\"Blogcast\"/> On his first day as director on ''The Last of Us'', Druckmann suffered from [[headache]]s and began [[Diplopia|seeing double]]; he discovered the following day that he required emergency eye surgery, as an infection threatened his vision in his left eye.<ref name=\"Retro Replay\"/> Druckmann is [[Judaism|Jewish]], although found he regularly writes about \"[[White people|white]], [[Heterosexual|straight]], [[Christianity|Christian]] male\" characters, encouraging him to instead create more diverse characters.<ref name=\"SCPR\"/>\n\n== Works ==\n\n=== Video games ===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border:none; margin:0;\n|- valign=\"bottom\"\n! scope=\"col\"| Year !! scope=\"col\"| Game title !! scope=\"col\"| Role\n|-\n| 2004 || ''Dikki Painguin in: TKO for the Third Reich'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Dikki Painguin\"/>\n|-\n| 2004 || ''[[Jak 3]]'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Creative\"/>\n|-\n| 2005 || ''[[Jak X: Combat Racing]]'' || Gameplay programmer<ref name=\"Creative\"/>\n|-\n| 2007 || ''[[Uncharted: Drake's Fortune]]'' || Game designer, co-writer<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/>\n|-\n| 2009 || ''[[Uncharted 2: Among Thieves]]'' || Co-lead game designer, co-writer<ref name=\"Edge\"/>\n|-\n| 2009 || ''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' || Original design and story<ref name=\"Frontier\">{{cite video game |title=''[[Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier]]'' |developer=[[High Impact Games]] |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |date=November 3, 2009 |platform=[[PlayStation Portable]] and [[PlayStation 2]] |version=1.0 |scene=Credits }}</ref>\n|-\n| 2013 || ''[[The Last of Us]]'' || Creative director, writer<ref name=\"New Tricks\"/>\n|-\n| 2014 || ''[[The Last of Us: Left Behind]]'' || Creative director, writer<ref name=\"TLOULB\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/the-last-of-us-developers-talk-left-behind-dlc-spo/2300-6417282/ |title=The Last of Us Developers Talk Left Behind DLC [SPOILERS] |last=Jayne |first=Jeremy |publisher=[[GameSpot]].

Von Ehrenfels introduced the concept of ''Gestalt'' to philosophy and psychology in 1890, before the advent of Gestalt psychology as such.<ref name = Smith1988>{{Cite book| publisher = Philosophia Verlag| editor-last = Smith| editor-first = Barry| last = Smith| first = Barry|title = Foundations of Gestalt Theory| chapter = Gestalt Theory: An Essay in Philosophy| location = Vienna| accessdate = 2019-10-12| date = 1988| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120222044129/http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/book/FoGT/Contents.htm| chapter-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120222044129/http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/gestalt.pdf| pages = 11\u201381}}</ref><ref name=Wagemans2012II/> Von Ehrenfels observed that a perceptual experience, such as perceiving a melody or a shape, is more than the sum of its sensory components.<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> He claimed that, in addition to the sensory elements of the perception, there is something extra. Although in some sense derived from the organization of the component sensory elements, this further quality is an element in its own right. He called it ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t'' or \"form-quality.\" For instance, when one hears a melody, one hears the notes plus something in addition to them that binds them together into a tune&nbsp;\u2013 the ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t''. It is this ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t'' that, according to von Ehrenfels, allows a tune to be transposed to a new key, using completely different notes, while still retaining its identity. The idea of a ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t'' has roots in theories by [[David Hume]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]],  and [[Ernst Mach]]. Both von Ehrenfels and [[Edmund Husserl]] seem to have been inspired by Mach's work ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Analyse der Empfindungen'' (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of ''gestalt'' and ''figural moment'', respectively.<ref name=\"Smith1988\" />\n\nThrough a series of experiments, Wertheimer discovered that a person observing a pair of alternating bars of light can, under the right conditions, experience the illusion of movement between one location and the other. He noted that this was a perception of motion absent any moving object. That is, it was pure phenomenal motion. He dubbed it [[phi phenomenon|phi (\"phenomenal\") motion]].<ref name = Smith1988/><ref name=Wagemans2012I>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1037/a0029333| issn = 1939-1455| volume = 138| issue = 6| pages = 1172\u20131217| last1 = Wagemans| first1 = Johan| last2 = Elder| first2 = James H.| last3 = Kubovy| first3 = Michael| last4 = Palmer| first4 = Stephen E.| last5 = Peterson| first5 = Mary A.| last6 = Singh| first6 = Manish| last7 = von der Heydt| first7 = R\u00fcdiger| title = A century of Gestalt psychology in visual perception: I.

The gestalt defines the parts from which it is composed, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/>  Wertheimer took the more radical position that \"what is given me by the melody does not arise ... as a secondary process from the sum of the pieces as such. Instead, what takes place in each single part already depends upon what the whole is\", (1925/1938). In other words, one hears the melody first and only then may perceptually divide it up into notes. Similarly, in vision, one sees the form of the circle first\u2014it is given \"im-mediately\" (i.e., its apprehension is not mediated by a process of part-summation). Only after this primary apprehension might one notice that it is made up of lines or dots or stars.\n\nThe two men who served as Wertheimer's subjects in the phi experiments were K\u00f6hler and Koffka. K\u00f6hler was an expert in physical acoustics, having studied under physicist [[Max Planck]] (1858\u20131947), but had taken his degree in psychology under [[Carl Stumpf]] (1848\u20131936). Koffka was also a student of Stumpf's, having studied movement phenomena and psychological aspects of rhythm. In 1917, K\u00f6hler (1917/1925) published the results of four years of research on learning in chimpanzees. K\u00f6hler showed, contrary to the claims of most other learning theorists, that animals can learn by \"sudden insight\" into the \"structure\" of a problem, over and above the associative and incremental manner of learning that [[Ivan Pavlov]] (1849\u20131936) and [[Edward Lee Thorndike]] (1874\u20131949) had demonstrated with dogs and cats, respectively.\n\nThe terms \"structure\" and \"organization\" were focal for the Gestalt psychologists. Stimuli were said to have a certain structure, to be organized in a certain way, and that it is to this structural organization, rather than to individual sensory elements, that the organism responds. When an animal is conditioned, it does not simply respond to the absolute properties of a stimulus, but to its properties relative to its surroundings. To use a favorite example of K\u00f6hler's, if conditioned to respond in a certain way to the lighter of two gray cards, the animal generalizes the relation between the two stimuli rather than the absolute properties of the conditioned stimulus: it will respond to the lighter of two cards in subsequent trials even if the darker card in the test trial is of the same intensity as the lighter one in the original training trials.\n\nIn 1921, Koffka published a Gestalt-oriented text on developmental psychology, ''Growth of the Mind''. With the help of American psychologist [[Robert Morris Ogden|Robert Ogden]], Koffka introduced the Gestalt point of view to an American audience in 1922 by way of a paper in ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''. It contains criticisms of then-current explanations of a number of problems of perception, and the alternatives offered by the Gestalt school. Koffka moved to the United States in 1924, eventually settling at [[Smith College]] in 1927. In 1935, Koffka published his ''Principles of Gestalt Psychology''. This textbook laid out the ''Gestalt'' vision of the scientific enterprise as a whole. Science, he said, is not the simple accumulation of facts. What makes research scientific is the incorporation of facts into a theoretical structure. The goal of the ''Gestaltists'' was to integrate the facts of inanimate nature, life, and mind into a single scientific structure. This meant that science would have to accommodate not only what Koffka called the quantitative facts of physical science but the facts of two other \"scientific categories\": questions of order and questions of ''Sinn'', a German word which has been variously translated as significance, value, and meaning. Without incorporating the meaning of experience and behavior, Koffka believed that science would doom itself to trivialities in its investigation of human beings.\n\nHaving survived the Nazis up to the mid-1930s,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henle | first1 = M | year = 1978 | title = One man against the Nazis: Wolfgang K\u00f6hler | url =https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/item/item_2347175_3/component/file_2347173/Henle_1978_One_man..pdf | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 33 | issue = 10| pages = 939\u2013944 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.33.10.939| hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-002B-9E5F-5 }}</ref> all the core members of the Gestalt movement were forced out of Germany to the United States by 1935.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henle | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = Robert M.

The founders of Gestalt therapy, [[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Laura Perls]], had worked with [[Kurt Goldstein]], a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls.<ref>Bernd Bocian: ''Fritz Perls in Berlin 1893\u20131933. Expressionism \u2013 Psychonalysis \u2013 Judaism'', 2010, p. 190, EHP Verlag Andreas Kohlhage, Bergisch Gladbach.</ref> The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, however. In any case it is not identical with Gestalt psychology. On the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term \"Gestalt\" to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the Gestalt psychologists would object to it;<ref>Joe Wysong/Edward Rosenfeld (eds): ''An Oral History of Gestalt Therapy'', Highland, New York 1982, The Gestalt Journal Press, p. 12.</ref> on the other hand Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work.<ref>Allen R. Barlow,  [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm \"Gestalt-Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident\"], ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, (Fall, 1981)</ref> Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most Gestalt psychologists emphasize that Gestalt therapy is not a form of Gestalt psychology.\n\n[[Mary Henle]] noted in her presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association (1975): \"What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions\u2014often unclear and often incompatible\u2014from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no substantive relation to scientific Gestalt psychology. To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is ''not'' Gestalt psychology\"<ref>Mary Henle 1975: [http://gestalttheory.net/archive/henle.html ''Gestalt Psychology and Gestalt Therapy'']; Presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association, Chicago, September 1975. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 14, pp 23-32.</ref> With her analysis however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method.<ref>See Barlow criticizing Henle: Allen R. Barlow: [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm ''Gestalt Therapy and Gestalt Psychology. Gestalt \u2013 Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident''], in: ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, Fall, 1981.</ref>\n\nThere have been clinical applications of Gestalt psychology in the psychotherapeutic field long before Perls'ian Gestalt therapy, in group psychoanalysis (Foulkes), Adlerian individual psychology, by Gestalt psychologists in psychotherapy like Erwin Levy, Abraham S. Luchins, by Gestalt psychologically oriented psychoanalysts in Italy (Canestrari and others), and there have been newer developments foremost in Europe. For example, a strictly Gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is [[Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy]], developed by the German Gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen Walter]] and his colleagues in Germany, Austria ([[Gerhard Stemberger]] and colleagues) and Switzerland.

The following subsections discuss these contributions in turn.\n\n===Theoretical framework and methodology===\nThe Gestalt psychologists practiced a set of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research. This is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object.\n\nThe theoretical principles are the following:\n* '''Principle of Totality'''\u2014Conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a [[system]] of dynamic relationships. Wertheimer described [[Holism in science|holism]] as fundamental to Gestalt psychology,<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> writing \"There are wholes, the behavior of which is not determined by that of their individual elements, but where the part-processes are themselves determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = Wertheimer| first = Max\n| date = 1938\n| orig-year = Original work published 1924\n| chapter = Gestalt theory\n| editor-last = Ellis| editor-first = Willis D.\n| title = A Source Book of Gestalt Psychology\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.198039/page/n14 2]\n| url = https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.198039\n| accessdate = 2019-10-16}}</ref> In other words, a perceptual whole is different from what one would predict based on only its individual parts.<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> Moreover, the nature of a part depends upon the whole in which it is embedded.<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> K\u00f6hler, for example, writes \"In psychology...we have wholes which, instead of being the sum of parts existing independently, give their parts specific functions or properties that can only be defined in relation to the whole in question.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = K\u00f6hler| first = Wolfgang\n| date = 1971\n| orig-year = Original work published 1930\n| chapter = Human perception\n| editor-last = Henle| editor-first = Mary\n| title = The Selected Papers of Wolfgang K\u00f6hler\n| publisher = Liveright\n| isbn = 978-0-87140-253-0\n| pages = 145}}</ref> Thus, the maxim that the whole is more than the sum of its parts is not a precise description of the Gestaltist view.<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> Rather, \"The whole is something else than the sum of its parts, because summing is a meaningless procedure, whereas the whole-part relationship is meaningful.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = Koffka| first = K.\n| date = 1935\n| title = Principles of Gestalt Psychology\n| location = New York\n| publisher = Harcourt, Brace\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7888/page/n191 176]\n| accessdate = 2019-10-13\n| url = https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7888}}</ref>\n\n* '''Principle of [[psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] [[isomorphism (Gestalt psychology)|isomorphism]]''' \u2013 K\u00f6hler hypothesized that there is a [[correlation]] between conscious experience and [[Human brain|cerebral]] activity.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/>\n\nBased on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:\n* '''Phenomenon experimental analysis'''\u2014In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities.\n* '''Biotic experiment'''\u2014The Gestalt psychologists established a need to conduct ''real experiments'' that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher [[fidelity]], what would be habitual for a subject.<ref>William Ray Woodward, Robert Sonn\u00e9 Cohen \u2013 World views and scientific discipline formation: science studies in the German Democratic Republic : papers from a German-American summer institute, 1988</ref>\n\n===Properties===\nThe key principles of gestalt systems are [[emergence]], reification, [[multistability]] and [[wikt:invariance|invariance]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The World in your Head: A Gestalt View of the Mechanism of Conscious Experience|last=Steven.|first=Lehar|date=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|isbn=0805841768|location=Mahwah, N.J.|pages=|oclc=52051454|url=http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/book/WIYH.html}}</ref>\n\n====Reification====<!-- This section is linked from [[Reification]] -->\n{{See also|Reification (fallacy)}}\n\n[[Image:Reification.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Reification]]\n\nReification is the ''constructive'' or ''generative'' aspect of perception, by which the experienced percept contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based.\n\nFor instance, a triangle is perceived in picture '''A''', though no triangle is there. In pictures '''B''' and '''D''' the eye recognizes disparate shapes as \"belonging\" to a single shape, in '''C''' a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.\n\nReification can be explained by progress in the study of [[illusory contours]], which are treated by the visual system as \"real\" contours.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n====Multistability====\n[[Image:Multistability.svg|left|thumb|260px|the [[Necker cube]] and the [[Rubin vase]], two examples of [[multistability]]]]\n\n[[Multistability]] (or [[multistable perception]]) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the [[Necker cube]] and [[Rubin vase|Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion]] shown here. Other examples include the [[Blivet|three-legged blivet]] and artist [[M. C. Escher]]'s artwork and the appearance of flashing [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other. Again, Gestalt psychology does not explain ''how'' images appear multistable, only that they ''do''.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n====Invariance====\n[[Image:Invariance.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Invariance]]\n\nInvariance is the property of [[perception]] whereby simple [[geometrical]] objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features. For example, the objects in '''A''' in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which are immediately distinguishable from the forms in '''B'''. They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in '''C''', and when depicted using different graphic elements as in '''D'''. Computational theories of vision, such as those by [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], have provided alternate explanations of how perceived objects are classified.\n\nEmergence, reification, multistability, and invariance are not necessarily separable modules to model individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] mechanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html |title=Gestalt Isomorphism |publisher=Sharp.bu.edu |accessdate=2012-04-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217033046/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html|archivedate=2012-02-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Figure-Ground Organization===\n\nThe perceptual field (what an organism perceives) is organized.

''Pr\u00e4gnanz'' is a German word that directly translates to \"pithiness\" and implies salience, conciseness, and orderliness.<ref name=\"todorvic\" /> The law of Pr\u00e4gnanz says that we tend to experience things as regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple. As Koffka put it, \"Of several geometrically possible organizations that one will actually occur which possesses the best, simplest and most stable shape.\"<ref name = Koffka1935>{{Cite book| publisher = Harcourt, Brace| last = Koffka| first = K.| title = Principles Of Gestalt Psychology| location = New York| accessdate = 2019-10-13| date = 1935| url = http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7888}}</ref>\n\nThe law of Pr\u00e4gnanz implies that, as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe reality in its most simplistic form.  Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning.  This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations. The law of good Gestalt focuses on the idea of conciseness, which is what all of Gestalt theory is based on.<ref name=\"stevenson\" />\n\nA major aspect of Gestalt [[psychology]] is that it implies that the [[mind]] understands external stimuli as wholes rather than as the sums of their parts.  The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws.\n\nGestalt [[psychologist]]s attempted to discover refinements of the law of ''Pr\u00e4gnanz'', and this involved writing down [[law (principle)|laws]] that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what are often called \"gestalt laws\".<ref name=\"gestaltpsych\">Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Third Edition, [[Thomson Wadsworth]]\u00a9 2003.</ref> Wertheimer defined a few principles that explain the ways humans perceive objects. Those principles were based on similarity, proximity, continuity.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7vd7JQ4zlcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+concise+corsini+encyclopedia+of+psychology+and+behavioral#v=onepage&q=gestalt&f=false|title=The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|last=Craighead|first=W.

These laws took several forms, such as the grouping of similar, or proximate, objects together, within this global process. These laws deal with the sensory modality of vision. However, there are analogous laws for other sensory modalities including auditory, tactile, gustatory and olfactory (Bregman \u2013 GP).  The visual Gestalt principles of grouping were introduced in Wertheimer (1923).  Through the 1930s and '40s Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka formulated many of the laws of grouping through the study of visual [[perception]].\n\n====Law of Proximity====\n[[Image:Gestalt proximity.svg|right|thumb|Law of proximity]]\nThe law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group.  For example, in the figure illustrating the law of proximity, there are 72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groups. Specifically, we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image, and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image.  This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated.<ref name=stevenson>{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Herb|title=Emergence: The Gestalt Approach to Change|url=http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/emergence-gestalt-approach-to-change.php|publisher=Unleashing Executive and Orzanizational Potential|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=Soegaard>{{cite web|last=Soegaard|first=Mads|title=Gestalt Principles of form Perception|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html|publisher=Interaction Design|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Law of Similarity====\n[[Image:Gestalt similarity.svg|right|thumb|Law of similarity]]\nThe law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other.  This similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities.  For example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square.  In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded light.  We perceive the dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together, forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.<ref name=\"Soegaard\"/>\n\n====Law of Closure====\n[[Image:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of closure]]\nGestalt psychologists believed that humans tend to perceive objects as complete rather than focusing on the gaps that the object might contain.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Perception|last=Hamlyn|first=D. W.|date=2017-03-27|isbn=9781315473291|doi=10.4324/9781315473291}}</ref> For example, a circle has good Gestalt in terms of completeness. However, we will also perceive an incomplete circle as a complete circle.<ref name=\"Brennan\" /> That tendency to complete shapes and figures is called closure.<ref name=\"Brennan\" /> The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete.  Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image.  However, gaps are present in the shapes.  If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures\u2014but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes.<ref name=\"stevenson\"/><ref name=\"Soegaard\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/05/why-your-brain-thinks-these-dots-are-a-dog/|title=Why Your Brain Thinks These Dots Are a Dog|website=Gizmodo UK|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n\n====Law of Symmetry====\n[[Image:Law of Symmetry.jpg|right|thumb|Law of symmetry]]\nThe law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts.  Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape.  Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets.  When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.<ref name=\"stevenson\"/><ref name=\"Soegaard\"/>\n\n====Law of Common Fate====\nThe law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that movement of elements of an object produce paths that individuals perceive that the objects are on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same path.  For example, if there are an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units.<ref name=todorvic>{{cite web|last=Todorovic|first=Dejan|title=Gestalt Principles|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gestalt_principles|volume=3|issue=12|pages=5345|work=[[Scholarpedia]] |accessdate=5 April 2012 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.5345|year=2008|bibcode=2008SchpJ...3.5345T}}</ref>\n\n====Law of Continuity====\n[[File:CrossKeys.png|alt=|thumb|Law of continuity]]\nThe law of continuity (also known as the law of good continuation) states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object.  In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap.  We are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one object.<ref name=\"stevenson\"/>\n\n====Law of Past Experience====\nThe law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience.  If two objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived together.  For example, the English language contains 26 letters that are grouped to form words using a set of rules.  If an individual reads an English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to interpret the letters \"L\" and \"I\" as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U.<ref name=\"todorvic\" />\n\n====Music====\nAn example of the Gestalt movement in effect, as it is both a process and result, is a music sequence. People are able to recognise a sequence of perhaps six or seven notes, despite them being transposed into a different tuning or key.<ref>{{cite book|title=A source book of Gestalt psychology|last1=Ellis|first1=Willis D.|date=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=Vol 2}}</ref>\n\n===Problem solving and insight===\nGestalt psychology contributed to the scientific study of problem solving.<ref name=Gobet2017 /> In fact, the early experimental work of the Gestaltists in Germany<ref name=Duncker>For example, {{cite book |author-last = Duncker| author-first = Karl| year = 1935 | title = Zur Psychologie des produktiven Denkens| language = German | trans-title = The psychology of productive thinking| location = Berlin| publisher = Julius Springer}}</ref> marks the beginning of the scientific study of problem solving. Later this experimental work continued through the 1960s and early 1970s with research conducted on relatively simple (but novel for participants) laboratory tasks of problem solving.<ref>For example Duncker's \"X-ray\" problem; Ewert & Lambert's \"disk\" problem in 1932, later known as [[Tower of Hanoi]].</ref><ref>{{Wikicite | id= Mayer| reference= Mayer, R.

He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must center a part of the image... The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving.

In any case, the structure of the [[retina]] in [[mammal]]s and in [[human being]]s is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of [[perception]] of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, \"fixes\" it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image \"marks time\" in the vicinity of this point.<ref>Valentin Fedorovich Turchin \u2013 The phenomenon of science \u2013 a cybernetic approach to human evolution \u2013 Columbia University Press, 1977</ref>\n\n===Quantum cognition modeling===\n{{main|Quantum cognition#Gestalt perception}}\n\nSimilarities between Gestalt phenomena and [[quantum mechanics]] have been pointed out by, among others, chemist [[Anton Amann]], who commented that \"similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable\" yet may give useful insight nonetheless.<ref>Anton Amann, The Gestalt problem in quantum theory: Generation of molecular shape by the environment.

Von Ehrenfels introduced the concept of ''Gestalt'' to philosophy and psychology in 1890, before the advent of Gestalt psychology as such.<ref name = Smith1988>{{Cite book| publisher = Philosophia Verlag| editor-last = Smith| editor-first = Barry| last = Smith| first = Barry|title = Foundations of Gestalt Theory| chapter = Gestalt Theory: An Essay in Philosophy| location = Vienna| accessdate = 2019-10-12| date = 1988| url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120222044129/http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/book/FoGT/Contents.htm| chapter-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120222044129/http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/gestalt.pdf| pages = 11\u201381}}</ref><ref name=Wagemans2012II/> Von Ehrenfels observed that a perceptual experience, such as perceiving a melody or a shape, is more than the sum of its sensory components.<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> He claimed that, in addition to the sensory elements of the perception, there is something extra. Although in some sense derived from the organization of the component sensory elements, this further quality is an element in its own right. He called it ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t'' or \"form-quality.\" For instance, when one hears a melody, one hears the notes plus something in addition to them that binds them together into a tune&nbsp;\u2013 the ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t''. It is this ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t'' that, according to von Ehrenfels, allows a tune to be transposed to a new key, using completely different notes, while still retaining its identity. The idea of a ''Gestalt-qualit\u00e4t'' has roots in theories by [[David Hume]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]],  and [[Ernst Mach]]. Both von Ehrenfels and [[Edmund Husserl]] seem to have been inspired by Mach's work ''Beitr\u00e4ge zur Analyse der Empfindungen'' (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of ''gestalt'' and ''figural moment'', respectively.<ref name=\"Smith1988\" />\n\nThrough a series of experiments, Wertheimer discovered that a person observing a pair of alternating bars of light can, under the right conditions, experience the illusion of movement between one location and the other. He noted that this was a perception of motion absent any moving object. That is, it was pure phenomenal motion. He dubbed it [[phi phenomenon|phi (\"phenomenal\") motion]].<ref name = Smith1988/><ref name=Wagemans2012I>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1037/a0029333| issn = 1939-1455| volume = 138| issue = 6| pages = 1172\u20131217| last1 = Wagemans| first1 = Johan| last2 = Elder| first2 = James H.| last3 = Kubovy| first3 = Michael| last4 = Palmer| first4 = Stephen E.| last5 = Peterson| first5 = Mary A.| last6 = Singh| first6 = Manish| last7 = von der Heydt| first7 = R\u00fcdiger| title = A century of Gestalt psychology in visual perception: I.

The gestalt defines the parts from which it is composed, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/>  Wertheimer took the more radical position that \"what is given me by the melody does not arise ... as a secondary process from the sum of the pieces as such. Instead, what takes place in each single part already depends upon what the whole is\", (1925/1938). In other words, one hears the melody first and only then may perceptually divide it up into notes. Similarly, in vision, one sees the form of the circle first\u2014it is given \"im-mediately\" (i.e., its apprehension is not mediated by a process of part-summation). Only after this primary apprehension might one notice that it is made up of lines or dots or stars.\n\nThe two men who served as Wertheimer's subjects in the phi experiments were K\u00f6hler and Koffka. K\u00f6hler was an expert in physical acoustics, having studied under physicist [[Max Planck]] (1858\u20131947), but had taken his degree in psychology under [[Carl Stumpf]] (1848\u20131936). Koffka was also a student of Stumpf's, having studied movement phenomena and psychological aspects of rhythm. In 1917, K\u00f6hler (1917/1925) published the results of four years of research on learning in chimpanzees. K\u00f6hler showed, contrary to the claims of most other learning theorists, that animals can learn by \"sudden insight\" into the \"structure\" of a problem, over and above the associative and incremental manner of learning that [[Ivan Pavlov]] (1849\u20131936) and [[Edward Lee Thorndike]] (1874\u20131949) had demonstrated with dogs and cats, respectively.\n\nThe terms \"structure\" and \"organization\" were focal for the Gestalt psychologists. Stimuli were said to have a certain structure, to be organized in a certain way, and that it is to this structural organization, rather than to individual sensory elements, that the organism responds. When an animal is conditioned, it does not simply respond to the absolute properties of a stimulus, but to its properties relative to its surroundings. To use a favorite example of K\u00f6hler's, if conditioned to respond in a certain way to the lighter of two gray cards, the animal generalizes the relation between the two stimuli rather than the absolute properties of the conditioned stimulus: it will respond to the lighter of two cards in subsequent trials even if the darker card in the test trial is of the same intensity as the lighter one in the original training trials.\n\nIn 1921, Koffka published a Gestalt-oriented text on developmental psychology, ''Growth of the Mind''. With the help of American psychologist [[Robert Morris Ogden|Robert Ogden]], Koffka introduced the Gestalt point of view to an American audience in 1922 by way of a paper in ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''. It contains criticisms of then-current explanations of a number of problems of perception, and the alternatives offered by the Gestalt school. Koffka moved to the United States in 1924, eventually settling at [[Smith College]] in 1927. In 1935, Koffka published his ''Principles of Gestalt Psychology''. This textbook laid out the ''Gestalt'' vision of the scientific enterprise as a whole. Science, he said, is not the simple accumulation of facts. What makes research scientific is the incorporation of facts into a theoretical structure. The goal of the ''Gestaltists'' was to integrate the facts of inanimate nature, life, and mind into a single scientific structure. This meant that science would have to accommodate not only what Koffka called the quantitative facts of physical science but the facts of two other \"scientific categories\": questions of order and questions of ''Sinn'', a German word which has been variously translated as significance, value, and meaning. Without incorporating the meaning of experience and behavior, Koffka believed that science would doom itself to trivialities in its investigation of human beings.\n\nHaving survived the Nazis up to the mid-1930s,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henle | first1 = M | year = 1978 | title = One man against the Nazis: Wolfgang K\u00f6hler | url =https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/item/item_2347175_3/component/file_2347173/Henle_1978_One_man..pdf | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 33 | issue = 10| pages = 939\u2013944 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.33.10.939| hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-002B-9E5F-5 }}</ref> all the core members of the Gestalt movement were forced out of Germany to the United States by 1935.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Henle | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = Robert M.

The founders of Gestalt therapy, [[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Laura Perls]], had worked with [[Kurt Goldstein]], a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls.<ref>Bernd Bocian: ''Fritz Perls in Berlin 1893\u20131933.

In any case it is not identical with Gestalt psychology. On the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term \"Gestalt\" to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the Gestalt psychologists would object to it;<ref>Joe Wysong/Edward Rosenfeld (eds): ''An Oral History of Gestalt Therapy'', Highland, New York 1982, The Gestalt Journal Press, p. 12.</ref> on the other hand Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work.<ref>Allen R.

Luchins, by Gestalt psychologically oriented psychoanalysts in Italy (Canestrari and others), and there have been newer developments foremost in Europe. For example, a strictly Gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is [[Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy]], developed by the German Gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist [[Hans-J\u00fcrgen Walter]] and his colleagues in Germany, Austria ([[Gerhard Stemberger]] and colleagues) and Switzerland. Other countries, especially Italy, have seen similar developments.\n\n== Contributions of Gestalt psychology ==\nGestalt psychology made many contributions to the body of psychology.

The following subsections discuss these contributions in turn.\n\n===Theoretical framework and methodology===\nThe Gestalt psychologists practiced a set of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research. This is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object.\n\nThe theoretical principles are the following:\n* '''Principle of Totality'''\u2014Conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a [[system]] of dynamic relationships. Wertheimer described [[Holism in science|holism]] as fundamental to Gestalt psychology,<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> writing \"There are wholes, the behavior of which is not determined by that of their individual elements, but where the part-processes are themselves determined by the intrinsic nature of the whole.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = Wertheimer| first = Max\n| date = 1938\n| orig-year = Original work published 1924\n| chapter = Gestalt theory\n| editor-last = Ellis| editor-first = Willis D.\n| title = A Source Book of Gestalt Psychology\n| location = London\n| publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.198039/page/n14 2]\n| url = https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.198039\n| accessdate = 2019-10-16}}</ref> In other words, a perceptual whole is different from what one would predict based on only its individual parts.<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> Moreover, the nature of a part depends upon the whole in which it is embedded.<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> K\u00f6hler, for example, writes \"In psychology...we have wholes which, instead of being the sum of parts existing independently, give their parts specific functions or properties that can only be defined in relation to the whole in question.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = K\u00f6hler| first = Wolfgang\n| date = 1971\n| orig-year = Original work published 1930\n| chapter = Human perception\n| editor-last = Henle| editor-first = Mary\n| title = The Selected Papers of Wolfgang K\u00f6hler\n| publisher = Liveright\n| isbn = 978-0-87140-253-0\n| pages = 145}}</ref> Thus, the maxim that the whole is more than the sum of its parts is not a precise description of the Gestaltist view.<ref name=Wagemans2012II/> Rather, \"The whole is something else than the sum of its parts, because summing is a meaningless procedure, whereas the whole-part relationship is meaningful.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n| last = Koffka| first = K.\n| date = 1935\n| title = Principles of Gestalt Psychology\n| location = New York\n| publisher = Harcourt, Brace\n| pages = [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7888/page/n191 176]\n| accessdate = 2019-10-13\n| url = https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7888}}</ref>\n\n* '''Principle of [[psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] [[isomorphism (Gestalt psychology)|isomorphism]]''' \u2013 K\u00f6hler hypothesized that there is a [[correlation]] between conscious experience and [[Human brain|cerebral]] activity.<ref name=Wagemans2012I/>\n\nBased on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:\n* '''Phenomenon experimental analysis'''\u2014In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities.\n* '''Biotic experiment'''\u2014The Gestalt psychologists established a need to conduct ''real experiments'' that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments.

In pictures '''B''' and '''D''' the eye recognizes disparate shapes as \"belonging\" to a single shape, in '''C''' a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.\n\nReification can be explained by progress in the study of [[illusory contours]], which are treated by the visual system as \"real\" contours.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n====Multistability====\n[[Image:Multistability.svg|left|thumb|260px|the [[Necker cube]] and the [[Rubin vase]], two examples of [[multistability]]]]\n\n[[Multistability]] (or [[multistable perception]]) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the [[Necker cube]] and [[Rubin vase|Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion]] shown here. Other examples include the [[Blivet|three-legged blivet]] and artist [[M. C. Escher]]'s artwork and the appearance of flashing [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other. Again, Gestalt psychology does not explain ''how'' images appear multistable, only that they ''do''.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n====Invariance====\n[[Image:Invariance.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Invariance]]\n\nInvariance is the property of [[perception]] whereby simple [[geometrical]] objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features. For example, the objects in '''A''' in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which are immediately distinguishable from the forms in '''B'''. They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in '''C''', and when depicted using different graphic elements as in '''D'''. Computational theories of vision, such as those by [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], have provided alternate explanations of how perceived objects are classified.\n\nEmergence, reification, multistability, and invariance are not necessarily separable modules to model individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] mechanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html |title=Gestalt Isomorphism |publisher=Sharp.bu.edu |accessdate=2012-04-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217033046/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html|archivedate=2012-02-17|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Figure-Ground Organization===\n\nThe perceptual field (what an organism perceives) is organized.

''Pr\u00e4gnanz'' is a German word that directly translates to \"pithiness\" and implies salience, conciseness, and orderliness.<ref name=\"todorvic\" /> The law of Pr\u00e4gnanz says that we tend to experience things as regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple. As Koffka put it, \"Of several geometrically possible organizations that one will actually occur which possesses the best, simplest and most stable shape.\"<ref name = Koffka1935>{{Cite book| publisher = Harcourt, Brace| last = Koffka| first = K.| title = Principles Of Gestalt Psychology| location = New York| accessdate = 2019-10-13| date = 1935| url = http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7888}}</ref>\n\nThe law of Pr\u00e4gnanz implies that, as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe reality in its most simplistic form.  Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning.  This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations. The law of good Gestalt focuses on the idea of conciseness, which is what all of Gestalt theory is based on.<ref name=\"stevenson\" />\n\nA major aspect of Gestalt [[psychology]] is that it implies that the [[mind]] understands external stimuli as wholes rather than as the sums of their parts.  The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws.\n\nGestalt [[psychologist]]s attempted to discover refinements of the law of ''Pr\u00e4gnanz'', and this involved writing down [[law (principle)|laws]] that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what are often called \"gestalt laws\".<ref name=\"gestaltpsych\">Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Third Edition, [[Thomson Wadsworth]]\u00a9 2003.</ref> Wertheimer defined a few principles that explain the ways humans perceive objects. Those principles were based on similarity, proximity, continuity.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F7vd7JQ4zlcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=the+concise+corsini+encyclopedia+of+psychology+and+behavioral#v=onepage&q=gestalt&f=false|title=The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|last=Craighead|first=W.

These laws took several forms, such as the grouping of similar, or proximate, objects together, within this global process. These laws deal with the sensory modality of vision. However, there are analogous laws for other sensory modalities including auditory, tactile, gustatory and olfactory (Bregman \u2013 GP).  The visual Gestalt principles of grouping were introduced in Wertheimer (1923).  Through the 1930s and '40s Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka formulated many of the laws of grouping through the study of visual [[perception]].\n\n====Law of Proximity====\n[[Image:Gestalt proximity.svg|right|thumb|Law of proximity]]\nThe law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group.  For example, in the figure illustrating the law of proximity, there are 72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groups. Specifically, we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image, and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image.  This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated.<ref name=stevenson>{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Herb|title=Emergence: The Gestalt Approach to Change|url=http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/emergence-gestalt-approach-to-change.php|publisher=Unleashing Executive and Orzanizational Potential|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=Soegaard>{{cite web|last=Soegaard|first=Mads|title=Gestalt Principles of form Perception|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html|publisher=Interaction Design|accessdate=8 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Law of Similarity====\n[[Image:Gestalt similarity.svg|right|thumb|Law of similarity]]\nThe law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other.  This similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities.  For example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square.  In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded light.  We perceive the dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together, forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.<ref name=\"Soegaard\"/>\n\n====Law of Closure====\n[[Image:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of closure]]\nGestalt psychologists believed that humans tend to perceive objects as complete rather than focusing on the gaps that the object might contain.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Psychology of Perception|last=Hamlyn|first=D. W.|date=2017-03-27|isbn=9781315473291|doi=10.4324/9781315473291}}</ref> For example, a circle has good Gestalt in terms of completeness. However, we will also perceive an incomplete circle as a complete circle.<ref name=\"Brennan\" /> That tendency to complete shapes and figures is called closure.<ref name=\"Brennan\" /> The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete.  Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image.  However, gaps are present in the shapes.  If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures\u2014but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes.<ref name=\"stevenson\"/><ref name=\"Soegaard\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/05/why-your-brain-thinks-these-dots-are-a-dog/|title=Why Your Brain Thinks These Dots Are a Dog|website=Gizmodo UK|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}</ref>\n\n====Law of Symmetry====\n[[Image:Law of Symmetry.jpg|right|thumb|Law of symmetry]]\nThe law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts.  Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape.  Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets.  When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.<ref name=\"stevenson\"/><ref name=\"Soegaard\"/>\n\n====Law of Common Fate====\nThe law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that movement of elements of an object produce paths that individuals perceive that the objects are on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same path.  For example, if there are an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units.<ref name=todorvic>{{cite web|last=Todorovic|first=Dejan|title=Gestalt Principles|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gestalt_principles|volume=3|issue=12|pages=5345|work=[[Scholarpedia]] |accessdate=5 April 2012 |doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.5345|year=2008|bibcode=2008SchpJ...3.5345T}}</ref>\n\n====Law of Continuity====\n[[File:CrossKeys.png|alt=|thumb|Law of continuity]]\nThe law of continuity (also known as the law of good continuation) states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object.  In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap.  We are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one object.<ref name=\"stevenson\"/>\n\n====Law of Past Experience====\nThe law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience.  If two objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived together.  For example, the English language contains 26 letters that are grouped to form words using a set of rules.  If an individual reads an English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to interpret the letters \"L\" and \"I\" as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U.<ref name=\"todorvic\" />\n\n====Music====\nAn example of the Gestalt movement in effect, as it is both a process and result, is a music sequence. People are able to recognise a sequence of perhaps six or seven notes, despite them being transposed into a different tuning or key.<ref>{{cite book|title=A source book of Gestalt psychology|last1=Ellis|first1=Willis D.|date=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=Vol 2}}</ref>\n\n===Problem solving and insight===\nGestalt psychology contributed to the scientific study of problem solving.<ref name=Gobet2017 /> In fact, the early experimental work of the Gestaltists in Germany<ref name=Duncker>For example, {{cite book |author-last = Duncker| author-first = Karl| year = 1935 | title = Zur Psychologie des produktiven Denkens| language = German | trans-title = The psychology of productive thinking| location = Berlin| publisher = Julius Springer}}</ref> marks the beginning of the scientific study of problem solving.

Fuzzy-trace theory posits that we encode information into two separate traces: verbatim and gist. Information stored in verbatim is exact memory for detail (the individual parts of a pattern, for example) while information stored in gist is semantic and conceptual (what we perceive the pattern to be). The effects seen in Gestalt psychology can be attributed to the way we encode information as gist.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Reyna|first=Valerie|year=2012|title=A new institutionism: Meaning, memory, and development in Fuzzy-Trace Theory|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|volume=7|issue=3|pages=332\u2013359|pmc=4268540|pmid=25530822}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=Lauren|year=2014|title=Visual Taxometric Approach to Image Segmentation Using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions|journal=Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems|series=Communications in Computer and Information Science|volume=443|pages=163\u2013173|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-08855-6_17|isbn=978-3-319-08854-9}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nGestalt psychology struggled to precisely define terms like Pr\u00e4gnanz, to make specific behavioral predictions, and to articulate testable models of underlying neural mechanisms.<ref name =Wagemans2012II>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1037/a0029334| issn = 1939-1455| volume = 138| issue = 6| pages = 1218\u20131252| last1 = Wagemans| first1 = Johan| last2 = Feldman| first2 = Jacob| last3 = Gepshtein| first3 = Sergei| last4 = Kimchi| first4 = Ruth| last5 = Pomerantz| first5 = James R.| last6 = van der Helm| first6 = Peter A.| last7 = van Leeuwen| first7 = Cees| title = A century of Gestalt psychology in visual perception: II.

He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must center a part of the image... The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.<ref>Lettvin, J.Y., Maturana, H.R., Pitts, W.H., and McCulloch, W.S. (1961). Two Remarks on the Visual System of the Frog. In Sensory Communication edited by Walter Rosenblith, MIT Press and John Wiley and Sons: New York</ref>\n\n:The lowest-level concepts related to visual perception for a human being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, the structure of the [[retina]] in [[mammal]]s and in [[human being]]s is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of [[perception]] of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, \"fixes\" it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image \"marks time\" in the vicinity of this point.<ref>Valentin Fedorovich Turchin \u2013 The phenomenon of science \u2013 a cybernetic approach to human evolution \u2013 Columbia University Press, 1977</ref>\n\n===Quantum cognition modeling===\n{{main|Quantum cognition#Gestalt perception}}\n\nSimilarities between Gestalt phenomena and [[quantum mechanics]] have been pointed out by, among others, chemist [[Anton Amann]], who commented that \"similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable\" yet may give useful insight nonetheless.<ref>Anton Amann, The Gestalt problem in quantum theory: Generation of molecular shape by the environment.

For this reason, they are viewed by some as redundant or uninformative. For example, a textbook on visual perception states that, \"The physiological theory of the gestaltists has fallen by the wayside, leaving us with a set of descriptive principles, but without a model of perceptual processing.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

The song first appeared on [[Radio Disney]] before its official US radio and single release in October 1999. It was released on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie]]'' in November 1999 and appears in the film's [[closing credits]]. The song was featured on M2M's debut album, ''[[Shades of Purple]]'' (2000), and also appeared on their compilation album ''[[The Day You Went Away: The Best of M2M]]'' (2003).\n\nThe song received positive reviews. [[Chuck Taylor (writer and editor)|Chuck Taylor]] from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said it was \"absolutely enchanting\" and would appeal to both young and mature listeners. It reached number 2 in Norway, number 4 in both Australia and New Zealand, number 16 in the UK and number 21 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It was [[Music recording sales certification|certified]] gold in the US and Australia and remained M2M's biggest hit. M2M performed the song on episodes of the TV series ''[[One World (TV series)|One World]]'', ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Disney Channel in Concert]]''. Two similar music videos were released for the song, with one showing clips from '' Pok\u00e9mon: The First Movie''.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[Marion Raven]] and [[Marit Larsen]] come from [[L\u00f8renskog]] in the district east of [[Oslo]].<ref name=taylortwo/> They met when they were five years old<ref name=sounds>{{cite news |date=30 June 2002 |title=Sounds From the Big Room |newspaper=[[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]] |location=Brisbane |page=Brisbane }}</ref> and became best friends, discovering they had similar interests in music.

It was formally opened in 1927 by Sir Frederick Guggisberg, then Governor of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony.

Former [[President of Ghana]], [[John Dramani Mahama]] had his primary education there while former [[Prime Minister of Ghana]], [[Kofi Abrefa Busia]] also taught at Achimota.

An alumnus/alumna of Achimota is known as an \"Akora\".\n\nThe motto of the school is ''[[Ut Omnes Unum Sint]]'' meaning \"That they all may be one\", a reference to the founders' expressed philosophy that starting in the context of school life, black and white, male and female, everyone should integrate and combine synergistically for the good of all. The stylised piano-key design of the Achimota School crest was described by Aggrey at the time: \"You can play a tune of sorts on the black keys only; and you can play a tune of sorts on the white keys only; but for perfect harmony, you must use both the black and the white keys.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724221438/http://www.ac2010.org/about_achimota.html Achimota School Capital Campaign], 24 July 2011, Ac2010.org. Retrieved 31 August 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter the First World War, the Government of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] felt the need for an advanced education. As Guggisberg put it, \"In spite of the existence of one or two educational institutions of a secondary nature, the intellectual gap between the African who had completed his education at an English University and the semi-educated African of our primary school is dangerously wide. No one is more ready than I to sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the African for advancement and for a greater share in the Government of this country, but if we are to help him to do this, if we are to protect the masses from the hasty and ill-conceived schemes of possible local [[demagogue]]s, we must hasten as rapidly as our means will allow to fill up the gap between the two classes.\"<ref name=\"gquote\">[[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], quoted in Stephanie Newell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 Literary Culture in Colonial Ghana: How to Play the Game of Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111336/http://books.google.ca/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 |date=27 September 2013 }}'', 2002, [[Manchester University Press]], 256 pages, p. 93. {{ISBN|978-0719062742}}</ref>\n\nAchimota College was therefore established as part of Guggisberg's plan to reform the Gold Coast educational system. In August 1920, Guggisberg met and befriended native-born Dr. [[James Aggrey]] who was in the Gold Coast as a member of the [[Phelps Stokes Fund]]'s African Education Commission. In 1922, as a result of the Phelps-Stokes Commission's 1920 report on education, Guggisberg appointed a committee to review its recommendations for Gold Coast education reform. That committee recommended the establishment of a comprehensive institution at Achimota to provide general secondary education, teacher training and technical education for male students. Achimota College was then conceived, thanks to the effort and support of Chiefs such as Nene Sir [[Emmanuel Mate Kole]], Konor of Manya Krobo; [[Nana Sir Ofori Atta]], Omanhene of [[Akyem Abuakwa]] and Nana Amonoo V, Omanhene of [[Anomabo]], as well as prominent statesmen of the time such as the Hon. Dr. [[Benjamin W. Quartey Quaye Papafio]], the Hon. [[F. V. Nanka-Bruce]], both of Accra; the Hon. [[Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr.]] of Accra, the Hon. E. J. P. Brown of [[Cape Coast]], and the Hon. [[J. E. Casely-Hayford]] of [[Sekondi]].\n\nThe Colonial government meant to carry out its policy to establish an excellent secondary institution where teachers as well as students would be trained. The Legislative Council went on to approve the 1923\u201324 budget for the establishment of the Prince of Wales College and School, and in March 1924, Guggisberg laid the foundation stone. Rev. Alexander G. Fraser was the first Principal (1924\u20131935), and Dr. [[James Aggrey]] was the first Vice-Principal (1924\u20131927). Fraser had previously been Principal of [[Trinity College, Kandy]], an elite school in [[Ceylon]], now [[Sri Lanka]], and was hailed as the greatest colonial headmaster of his day by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Aggrey campaigned vigorously for women's education at a time when the idea was not popular, and held the belief that to educate a man was to educate an individual, while educating a woman had more far-reaching benefits to family and community. This led to an increase in the number of places offered to girls by the College.\n\nFrom 1924 until it opened on 28 January 1927, Guggisberg, Fraser and Aggrey worked together to realise Guggisberg's dream of establishing a first-class co-educational school and college.

The guest of honour at the opening ceremony was [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]], the then Prince of Wales, after whom the school was named. As one of the most prestigious institutions of its kind, known for its high academic standards and culture, it trained [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] leaders during Sub-Saharan Africa's struggle for independence from colonial powers. From its student body and teaching college emerged many notable African personalities, including several heads of state, politicians, academics, scientists, doctors, lawyers, engineers, educators, architects, diplomats, computer scientists, agriculturists, accountants, artists, business leaders and industrialists. In a 2004 tribute to Akora Adrian Sherwood, a longtime English master at Achimota, the Ghana High Commission in London praised Achimota, quoting the words of the school's founding doctrine, for enabling its graduates \"to know the life that is life indeed and go forth from it as living waters to a thirsty land.\"<ref name=\"sherwood\">\n[http://www.modernghana.com/news/48541/1/author-of-english-for-modern-africa-dies.html \"Author of English For Modern Africa Dies\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927193921/http://www.modernghana.com/news/48541/1/author-of-english-for-modern-africa-dies.html |date=27 September 2013 }} , 30 January 2004, Ghana High Commission, London.

It was formally opened in 1927 by Sir Frederick Guggisberg, then Governor of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony.

An alumnus/alumna of Achimota is known as an \"Akora\".\n\nThe motto of the school is ''[[Ut Omnes Unum Sint]]'' meaning \"That they all may be one\", a reference to the founders' expressed philosophy that starting in the context of school life, black and white, male and female, everyone should integrate and combine synergistically for the good of all. The stylised piano-key design of the Achimota School crest was described by Aggrey at the time: \"You can play a tune of sorts on the black keys only; and you can play a tune of sorts on the white keys only; but for perfect harmony, you must use both the black and the white keys.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724221438/http://www.ac2010.org/about_achimota.html Achimota School Capital Campaign], 24 July 2011, Ac2010.org. Retrieved 31 August 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter the First World War, the Government of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] felt the need for an advanced education. As Guggisberg put it, \"In spite of the existence of one or two educational institutions of a secondary nature, the intellectual gap between the African who had completed his education at an English University and the semi-educated African of our primary school is dangerously wide. No one is more ready than I to sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the African for advancement and for a greater share in the Government of this country, but if we are to help him to do this, if we are to protect the masses from the hasty and ill-conceived schemes of possible local [[demagogue]]s, we must hasten as rapidly as our means will allow to fill up the gap between the two classes.\"<ref name=\"gquote\">[[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], quoted in Stephanie Newell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 Literary Culture in Colonial Ghana: How to Play the Game of Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111336/http://books.google.ca/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 |date=27 September 2013 }}'', 2002, [[Manchester University Press]], 256 pages, p. 93. {{ISBN|978-0719062742}}</ref>\n\nAchimota College was therefore established as part of Guggisberg's plan to reform the Gold Coast educational system. In August 1920, Guggisberg met and befriended native-born Dr. [[James Aggrey]] who was in the Gold Coast as a member of the [[Phelps Stokes Fund]]'s African Education Commission. In 1922, as a result of the Phelps-Stokes Commission's 1920 report on education, Guggisberg appointed a committee to review its recommendations for Gold Coast education reform. That committee recommended the establishment of a comprehensive institution at Achimota to provide general secondary education, teacher training and technical education for male students. Achimota College was then conceived, thanks to the effort and support of Chiefs such as Nene Sir [[Emmanuel Mate Kole]], Konor of Manya Krobo; [[Nana Sir Ofori Atta]], Omanhene of [[Akyem Abuakwa]] and Nana Amonoo V, Omanhene of [[Anomabo]], as well as prominent statesmen of the time such as the Hon. Dr. [[Benjamin W. Quartey Quaye Papafio]], the Hon. [[F. V. Nanka-Bruce]], both of Accra; the Hon. [[Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr.]] of Accra, the Hon. E. J. P. Brown of [[Cape Coast]], and the Hon. [[J. E. Casely-Hayford]] of [[Sekondi]].\n\nThe Colonial government meant to carry out its policy to establish an excellent secondary institution where teachers as well as students would be trained. The Legislative Council went on to approve the 1923\u201324 budget for the establishment of the Prince of Wales College and School, and in March 1924, Guggisberg laid the foundation stone. Rev. Alexander G. Fraser was the first Principal (1924\u20131935), and Dr. [[James Aggrey]] was the first Vice-Principal (1924\u20131927). Fraser had previously been Principal of [[Trinity College, Kandy]], an elite school in [[Ceylon]], now [[Sri Lanka]], and was hailed as the greatest colonial headmaster of his day by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Aggrey campaigned vigorously for women's education at a time when the idea was not popular, and held the belief that to educate a man was to educate an individual, while educating a woman had more far-reaching benefits to family and community. This led to an increase in the number of places offered to girls by the College.\n\nFrom 1924 until it opened on 28 January 1927, Guggisberg, Fraser and Aggrey worked together to realise Guggisberg's dream of establishing a first-class co-educational school and college.

In a 2004 tribute to Akora Adrian Sherwood, a longtime English master at Achimota, the Ghana High Commission in London praised Achimota, quoting the words of the school's founding doctrine, for enabling its graduates \"to know the life that is life indeed and go forth from it as living waters to a thirsty land.\"<ref name=\"sherwood\">\n[http://www.modernghana.com/news/48541/1/author-of-english-for-modern-africa-dies.html \"Author of English For Modern Africa Dies\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927193921/http://www.modernghana.com/news/48541/1/author-of-english-for-modern-africa-dies.html |date=27 September 2013 }} , 30 January 2004, Ghana High Commission, London.

The participants spend three or four days on the school\u2019s campus.\n*'''Constitution''': The OAA is governed by a constitution, whose principal objective is \"the formation of a bond of union between Old Achimotans and the School to promote the maintenance of their interest in the School and their willingness to assist in its welfare, and to promote the ideals for which Achimota was founded\".\n*'''National Executive Committee''': The OAA's affairs and funds are managed by a National Executive Committee. The Committee consists of three officers of the Association, two ex-officio officers, the immediate past President of the Association and eight other members.
