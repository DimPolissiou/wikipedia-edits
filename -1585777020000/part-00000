That year was also characterized by political disarray in Texas. In 1836, no fewer than five Texas sites served as temporary capitals of the new republic ([[Washington-on-the-Brazos]], [[Harrisburg, Texas|Harrisburg]], [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], [[Velasco, Texas|Velasco]] and [[Columbia, Texas|Columbia]]), before President [[Sam Houston]] moved the capital to [[Houston]] in 1837.<ref>{{cite book |last= Johnson |first= John G. |title= Capitals |journal= Handbook of Texas |url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/mzc01 |accessdate= September 10, 2011}}</ref>\n\nShortly after the election of President [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], the [[Texas Congress]] appointed a site-selection commission to locate an optimal site for a new permanent capital. They chose a site on the western frontier, after viewing it at the instruction of President Lamar, who visited the sparsely settled area in 1838. Lamar was a proponent of [[westward expansion]]. Impressed by its beauty, abundant natural resources, promise as an economic hub, and central location in Texas territory, the commission purchased {{convert|7735|acre|ha}} along the Colorado River comprising the hamlet of Waterloo and adjacent lands.<ref>{{cite book |last= Hazlewood |first= Claudia |title= Waterloo, Texas (Travis County) |journal= Handbook of Texas |url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hvw13 |accessdate= September 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBecause the area's remoteness from population centers and its vulnerability to attacks by [[Mexican army|Mexican troops]] and Native Americans displeased many Texans, [[Sam Houston]] among them, political opposition made Austin's early years precarious ones. However, Lamar prevailed in his nomination, which he felt would be a prime location that intersected the roads to [[San Antonio]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wharton|first=Clarence|title=The republic of Texas: a brief history of Texas from the first American colonies in 1821 to annexation in 1846|publisher=C.

According to local folklore, [[Stephen F.

Waller chose a {{convert|640|acre|ha|adj=on}} site on a bluff above the Colorado River, nestled between Shoal Creek to the west and Waller Creek (which was named for him) to the east. Waller surveyed a [[grid plan]] on a single square-mile plot with 14 blocks running in both directions. One grand avenue, which Lamar named [[Congress Avenue|\"Congress\"]], cut through the center of town from Capitol Square down to the Colorado River. The streets running north\u2013south (paralleling Congress) were named for Texas rivers with their order of placement matching the order of rivers on the Texas state map. The east\u2013west streets were named after trees native to the region, despite the fact that Waller had recommended using numbers. (They were eventually changed to numbers in 1884.) The city's perimeters stretched north to south from the river at 1st Street to 15th Street, and from East Avenue (now [[Interstate 35]]) to West Avenue.<ref>{{cite book |first=Spurlin |last=Charles D. |journal= Handbook of Texas |title= Waller, Edwin |url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fwa38 |accessdate= September 6, 2011}}</ref> Much of this original design is still intact in downtown Austin today.\n\nIn October 1839, the entire government of the Republic of Texas arrived by [[Red River cart|oxcart]] from [[Houston]]. By the next January, the population of the town was 839. During the Republic of Texas era, France sent Alphonse Dubois de Saligny to Austin as its [[charg\u00e9 d'affaires]]. Dubois purchased {{convert|22|acre}} of land in 1840 on a high hill just east of downtown to build a legation, or diplomatic outpost.

Lamar's successor as [[President of the Republic of Texas]], [[Sam Houston]], ordered the national archives transferred to Houston for safekeeping after Mexican troops captured San Antonio on March 5, 1842. Convinced that removal of the republic's diplomatic, financial, land, and military-service records was tantamount to choosing a new capital, Austinites refused to relinquish the archives. Houston moved the government anyway, first to Houston and then to [[Washington-on-the-Brazos]], which remained the seat of government until 1845. The archives stayed in Austin. When Houston sent a contingent of armed men to seize the [[Texas General Land Office|General Land Office]] records in December 1842, they were foiled by the citizens of Austin and [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] in an incident known as the [[Texas Archive War]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/republic/archwar/archwar.html |title= Texas Archives War |author= Texas State Library and Archives Commission |publisher= Texas State Library, Texas Treasures |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> Deprived of its political function, Austin languished. Between 1842 and 1845 its population dropped below 200 and its buildings deteriorated.\n\nDuring the summer of 1845, [[Anson Jones]], Houston's successor as president, called a constitutional convention meeting in Austin, approved the [[annexation of Texas]] to the United States and named Austin the state capital until 1850, at which time the voters of Texas were to express their preference in a general election. After resuming its role as the seat of government in 1845, Austin officially became the state capital on February 19, 1846, the date of the formal transfer of authority from the republic to the state.<ref>{{citation |last= Winfrey |first= Dorman H. |title= The Texan Archive War of 1842 |journal=Southwestern Historical Quarterly |publisher= Texas Historical Association |date= October 1960 |volume= 64 |issue= 2 |pages= 171\u2013184 |url= http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth101190/m1/197/ |accessdate= January 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAustin's status as capital city of the new U.S. state of Texas remained in doubt until 1872, when the city prevailed in a statewide election to choose once and for all the state capital, turning back challenges from Houston and [[Waco, Texas|Waco]].<ref>{{cite book |last= Winders |first= Ricard Bruce |title= Crisis in the Southwest: The United States, Mexico, and the Struggle over Texas |publisher= Lanham, Rowman & Littlefield |year= 2002 |page= 41}}</ref>\n\n===Statehood and the U.S. Civil War===\n[[File:Texas state capitol 1.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Texas State Capitol]]\nAustin recovered gradually, population reaching 854 by 1850, 225 of whom were slaves and one a free black. Forty-eight percent of Austin's family heads owned slaves. The city entered a period of accelerated growth following its decisive triumph in the 1850 election to determine the site of the state capital for the next twenty years. For the first time the government constructed permanent buildings, among them a new capitol at the head of [[Congress Avenue]], completed in 1853, and the [[Texas Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]], completed in 1856. State-run asylums for deaf, blind, and mentally ill Texans were erected on the fringes of town. Congregations of Baptists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Catholics erected permanent church buildings, and the town's elite built elegant [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] mansions. By 1860 the population had climbed to 3,546, including 1,019 slaves and twelve free blacks. That year thirty-five percent of Austin's family heads owned slaves.\n\nWhile Texas voted overwhelmingly to secede from the Union and join the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in 1861, [[Travis County]] was one of a few counties in state to vote against the secession ordinance (704 to 450). However, Unionist sentiment waned once the war began. By April 1862 about 600 Austin and Travis County men had joined some twelve volunteer companies serving the Confederacy. Austinites followed with particular concern news of the successive Union thrusts toward Texas, but the town was never directly threatened. Like other communities, Austin experienced severe shortages of goods, spiraling inflation, and the decimation of its fighting men.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Greene |first= A.C. |year= 1969 |title= The Durable Society: Austin in the Reconstruction |journal= The Southwestern Historical Quarterly |volume= 72 |issue= 4 |pages= 492\u2013518 |publisher= Texas State Historical Association |jstor= 30236542 }}</ref> The end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] brought Union occupation troops to the city and a period of explosive growth of the African-American population, which increased by 57 percent during the 1860s. During the late 1860s and early 1870s the city's newly emancipated blacks established the residential communities of Masontown, Wheatville, Pleasant Hill, and [[Clarksville Historic District (Austin, Texas)|Clarksville]]. By 1870, Austin's 1,615 black residents comprised some 36 percent of the town's 4,428 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite news |last= Cannon |first= Deborah |title= Reflections of Black Austin |journal= [[Austin American-Statesman]] |date= February 22, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Emergence of a political and educational center===\n[[File:Old Main Building at The University of Texas at Austin .jpg|right|thumbnail|The university's Old Main Building in 1903]]\nThe Reconstruction boom of the 1870s brought dramatic changes to Austin. In the [[Downtown Austin|downtown]] area, the wooden wagon yards and saloons of the 1850s and 1860s began to be replaced by the more solid masonry structures still standing today. On December 25, 1871, a new era opened with the coming of the [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]], Austin's first railroad connection. By becoming the westernmost railroad terminus in Texas and the only railroad town for scores of miles in most directions, Austin was transformed into a trading center for a vast area. Construction boomed and the population more than doubled in five years to 10,363. The many foreign-born newcomers gave Austin's citizenry a more heterogeneous character. By 1875 there were 757 inhabitants from Germany, 297 from Mexico, 215 from Ireland, and 138 from Sweden. For the first time a [[Mexican-American]] community took root in Austin, in a neighborhood near the mouth of Shoal Creek. Accompanying these dramatic changes were civic improvements, among them gas street lamps in 1874, the first [[streetcar]] line in 1875, and the first elevated bridge across the Colorado River about 1876. Although a second railroad, the [[International \u2013 Great Northern Railroad|International and Great Northern]], reached Austin in 1876, the town's fortunes turned downward after 1875 as new railroads traversed Austin's trading region and diverted much of its trade to other towns. From 1875 to 1880 the city's population increased by only 650 inhabitants to 11,013.<ref>{{cite web |last= Cox |first= Mike |title= Austin as Texas' Capital |publisher= Texas Escapes |date= September 16, 2011 |url= http://www.texasescapes.com/MikeCoxTexasTales/Austin-as-Texas-Capital.htm |accessdate= November 23, 2011}}</ref> Austin's expectations of rivaling other Texas cities for economic leadership faded.\n\nHowever, Austin solidified its position as a political center during the 1870s, after the city prevailed in the 1872 statewide election to settle the state capital question once and for all. Three years later Texas took the first steps toward constructing a new [[Texas State Capitol]] that culminated in 1888 in the dedication of a magnificent granite building towering over the town. After a fire destroyed its predecessor in 1881, a nationwide design contest was held to determine who would build the current Capitol building. Architect [[Elijah E. Myers]], who built the Capitols of [[Michigan State Capitol|Michigan]] and [[Colorado State Capitol|Colorado]], won with a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style. However, construction was held up for two years over a debate as to whether the exterior should be built from granite or limestone. It was eventually decided that it would be built of \"sunset red\" granite from [[Marble Falls, Texas|Marble Falls]]. Funded by the famous [[XIT Ranch]], the building remains part of the Austin skyline. The state capitol is smaller than the [[United States Capitol]] in total gross square footage, but is actually {{convert|15|ft|m}} taller than its Washington, D.C., counterpart.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Texas State Capitol |last= Cotner |first= Robert C. |year= 1968 |publisher= Pemberton Press |location= Austin |isbn= 0-292-73703-3 |pages= 15\u201317}}</ref>\n\nAnother statewide election in 1881 set the stage for Austin to become an educational and cultural hub as well, when it was chosen as the site for a new state university in a hotly contested election. A state constitution adopted in 1876 mandated that Texas establish a \"university of the first class\" to be located by vote of the people and styled the [[University of Texas]]. On September 6, 1881, Austin was chosen for the site of the main university and [[Galveston]] for the location of the medical department. In 1882 construction began on the Austin campus with the placement of the cornerstone of the [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|Main Building]]. The university held classes for the first time in 1883.<ref>{{cite web |last= Battle |first= William Janes |title= University of Texas at Austin |url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kcu09 |accessdate= November 23, 2011}}</ref> Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute, the forerunner of [[Huston-Tillotson University]], founded by the American Missionary Association to provide educational opportunities for African-Americans, opened its doors in East Austin by 1881. The [[Austin Independent School District]] was established the same year.\n\nBefore either UT or Huston-Tillotson opened their doors, however, St. Edward's Academy (the forerunner of today's [[St. Edward's University]]) was established by the Rev. [[Edward Sorin]] in 1878 on farmland in present-day south Austin. In 1885, the president, the Rev. P.&nbsp;J. Franciscus strengthened the prestige of the academy by securing a charter, changing its name to St. Edward's College, assembling a faculty, and increasing enrollment. Subsequently, St. Edward's began to grow, and the first school newspaper, the organization of baseball and football teams, and approval to erect an administration building all followed. Well-known architect [[Nicholas J. Clayton]] of Galveston was commissioned to design the college's Main Building, four stories tall and constructed with local white [[limestone]] in the [[Gothic Revival]], that was finished in 1888.<ref>{{cite web |title= St. Edward's University Celebrates Centennial of Main Building |publisher= St. Edward's University |date= October 8, 2003 |url= http://think.stedwards.edu/marketing/blog/post/st-edwards-university-celebrates-centennial-main-building |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222133607/http://think.stedwards.edu/marketing/blog/post/st-edwards-university-celebrates-centennial-main-building |archive-date= December 22, 2015 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOf note during this period were serial murders committed in 1884 and 1885 by an unidentified perpetrator known as the \"[[Servant Girl Annihilator]]\". According to some sources there were eight murders, seven women and one man, attributed to the serial killer, in addition to eight serious injuries. These occurred in a town that had only about 23,000 citizens total. The murders made national headlines, but only three years later [[London]] was plagued by [[Jack the Ripper]] overshadowing Austin's tragedy in the history books.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Capital Murder | author=Hollandsworth, Skip | date=July 2000 | magazine=Texas Monthly | url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/capital-murder/}}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\n\n===Learning to live with the Colorado River===\nAustin's fortunes have been tied with the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] for much of its history, no more so than in the 1890s. At the urging of local civic leader [[Alexander P. Wooldridge]], the citizens of Austin voted overwhelmingly to put themselves deeply in debt to build a dam along the river to attract manufacturing. The hope was that cheap hydroelectricity would lure industrialists who would line the riverbanks with cotton mills. Austin would become \"the [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] of the South,\" and the sleepy center of government and education would be transformed into a bustling industrial city. The town had reached its limits as a seat of politics and education, Wooldridge contended, yet its economy could not sustain its present size. Empowered by a new city charter in 1891 that more than tripled Austin's corporate area from 4 \u00bd to 16 \u00bd square miles, the city fathers implemented a plan to build a municipal water and electric system, construct a dam for power, and lease most of the hydroelectric power to manufacturers. By 1893 the sixty-foot-high [[McDonald Dam failure|Austin Dam]] was completed just northwest of town. In 1895 dam-generated electricity began powering the four-year-old electric streetcar line and the city's new water and light systems. The dammed river formed a lake that became known as \"Lake McDonald,\" for John McDonald, the mayor who had whipped up support for the project\u2014attracted new residents and developers, while the waters of the lake itself drew those seeking respite from the Texas heat. Austin boomed in the mid-1890s, driven largely by land speculation. [[Monroe Shipe]] established [[Hyde Park Historic District (Austin, Texas)|Hyde Park]], a classic [[streetcar suburb]] north of downtown, and smaller developments sprang up around the city. Thirty-one new 165-foot-high [[moonlight towers]] illuminated Austin at night. Civic pride ran strong during those years, which also saw the city blessed with the talents of sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]] and writer [[O.

But [[Scientific American]] magazine was sufficiently impressed to feature the dam on its cover. However, structurally the dam was likely doomed from the start, as it was constructed on the spot where the [[Balcones Fault]] passes under the river. Silt had filled nearly half the lake by February 1900, and the dam's design failed to accommodate the force that could be created by a large volume of water. However, the flow of the Colorado proved to be far more variable than the project's promoters had claimed, and the dam was never able to produce the kind of steady power needed to drive a bank of mills. The manufacturers never came, periodic power shortfalls disrupted city services, Lake McDonald silted up, and, on April 7, 1900, the Austin Dam was dealt its final blow after a spring storm. At 11:20&nbsp;am, floodwaters crested at 11 feet atop the dam before it disintegrated, with two 250-foot sections \u2013 almost half the dam \u2013 breaking away. In all, the flood drowned 18 people and destroyed 100 houses in Austin, at a total estimated loss of $1.4 million, in 1900 dollars.<ref>{{cite web |last= Hunt |first= Bruce J. |title= The Rise and Fall of the Austin Dam |publisher= Not Even Past |date= July 13, 2011 |url= http://www.notevenpast.org/texas/rise-and-fall-austin-dam |accessdate= November 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1900, the people of Austin did what they could to recover from the disaster. Having gotten a taste of city-owned electric power, they refused to go back; they bought out the local private power company, which used steam-driven generators, and today's Austin Energy municipal utility is in a sense a legacy of the old Austin Dam. The city also tried to rebuild the dam itself, but a dispute with the contractor left the repairs unfinished in 1912, and another flood in 1915 damaged it further. The wrecked dam sat derelict, \"a tombstone on the river,\" until the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] stepped in and, with federal money, rebuilt it as [[Tom Miller Dam]], completed in 1940. The remaining portions of the 1893 and 1912 dams were incorporated into the new structure, but are now hidden under new layers of concrete.<ref>{{cite web |last= Spencer |first= Jim |title= First Austin Dam Collapse 110 Years Ago Today |publisher= KXAN Blogs |date= April 7, 2010 |url= http://blogs.kxan.com/2010/04/07/tom-miller-dam-turns-70/ |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107132723/http://blogs.kxan.com/2010/04/07/tom-miller-dam-turns-70/ |archive-date= November 7, 2011 |url-status= dead }}</ref> By the time it was finished, however, Tom Miller Dam was already overshadowed by the much larger LCRA dams built upstream that formed the [[Texas Highland Lakes]]. For the last seventy years, [[Lake Travis]] ([[Mansfield Dam]]) and [[Lake Buchanan (Texas)|Lake Buchanan]] ([[Buchanan Dam]]), have provided water, hydroelectric power, and flood control for Central Texas.\n\nBetween 1880 and 1920 Austin's population grew threefold to 34,876, but the city slipped from fourth largest in the state to tenth largest. The state's surging industrial development, propelled by the booming oil business, passed Austin by. The capital city began boosting itself as a residential city, but the heavy municipal indebtedness incurred in building the dam resulted in the neglect of city services. On December 20, 1886, the [[Driskill Hotel]] opened at [[6th Street (Austin)|6th]] and Brazos, giving Austin its first premier hotel. The hotel would close and reopen many times in subsequent years. In 1905 Austin had few sanitary sewers, virtually no public parks or playgrounds, and only one paved street. Three years later Austin voters overturned the [[alderman]] form of government, by which the city had been governed since 1839, and replaced it with commission government. Wooldridge headed the reform group voted into office in 1909 and served a decade as mayor, during which the city made steady if modest progress toward improving residential life. The [[Littlefield building|Littefield]] and [[Scarbrough building|Scarborough buildings]] at 6th and Congress downtown also opened that year, representing the city's first skyscrapers.<ref>{{cite web |last= Wermund |first= Ben |title= Littlefield, Scarbrough buildings mark a century in Austin |publisher= Austin American-Statesman |date= October 5, 2011 |url= http://www.statesman.com/news/local/littlefield-scarbrough-buildings-mark-a-century-in-austin-955944.html |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101013120919/http://www.statesman.com/news/local/littlefield-scarbrough-buildings-mark-a-century-in-austin-955944.html |archive-date= October 13, 2010 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref> In 1910, the city opened the concrete [[Ann W. Richards Congress Avenue Bridge|Congress Avenue Bridge]] across the Colorado River and, by the next year, had extended the streetcar line to South Austin along [[South Congress]] Avenue. The fostered development south of the river for the first time, allowing for development of [[Travis Heights]] in 1913.\n\nIn 1918 the city acquired [[Barton Springs]], a spring-fed pool that became the symbol of the residential city. Upon Wooldridge's retirement in 1919 the flaws of commission government, hidden by his leadership, became apparent as city services again deteriorated. At the urging of the Chamber of Commerce, Austinites voted in 1924 to adopt [[council-manager government]], which went into effect in 1926 and remains in effect today. Progressive ideas like city planning and beautification became official city policy. A 1928 city plan, the first since 1839, called upon Austin to develop its strengths as a residential, cultural, and educational center. A $4,250,000 bond issue, Austin's largest to date, provided funds for streets, sewers, parks, the city hospital, the first permanent public library building, and the first municipal airport, which opened in 1930. A recreation department was established, and within a decade it offered Austinites a profusion of recreational programs, parks, and pools.<ref>{{cite web |title= History of Austin's Forms of Government |publisher= Office of the City Clerk, City of Austin |year= 1995 |url= http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/election/formsgov.htm |accessdate= November 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Race and the 1928 City Plan===\n[[File:Austin TX 1920 map.jpg|thumb|Map of Austin 1920]]\nBy the early years of the 20th century, African-Americans occupied settlements in various parts of the city of Austin. By and large, these residential communities had churches at their core. Some had black-run businesses and schools for African-American youth. Though surrounded by Anglo neighborhoods, these island enclaves functioned as fairly autonomous residential neighborhoods often organized around family ties, common religious practices, and connection to pre-emancipation slave-status relationships with common slave holders/land owners. Though some date back to slavery, by the 1920s these communities were located across the city and include Kincheonville (1865), Wheatville (1867), [[Clarksville Historic District (Austin, Texas)|Clarksville]] (1871), Masonville, St. Johns, Pleasant Hill, and other settlements.<ref>{{cite web |title= Hoe East Austin Became a Negro District |publisher= East End Cultural Heritage District & Diverse Arts |year= 2010 |url= http://diversearts.microassistdemo.com/politics-civic-engagement/how-east-austin-became-negro-district |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001420/http://diversearts.microassistdemo.com/politics-civic-engagement/how-east-austin-became-negro-district |archive-date= April 26, 2012 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhile residences of blacks had been widely scattered all across the city in 1880, by 1930 they were heavily concentrated in East Austin, a process encouraged by the 1928 City Plan, which recommended that East Austin be designated a \"Negro district.\" City officials implemented the plan successfully, and most blacks who had been living in the western half of the city were \"relocated\" back to the former plantation lands, on the other side of East Avenue (now [[Interstate 35]]). Municipal services like schools, sewers, and parks were made available to blacks in East Austin only. At mid-century Austin was still segregated in most respects\u2014housing, restaurants, hotels, parks, hospitals, schools, public transportation\u2014but African Americans had long fostered their own institutions, which included by the late 1940s some 150 small businesses, more than thirty churches, and two colleges, Tillotson College and Samuel Huston College. Between 1880 and 1940 the number of black residents grew from 3,587 to 14,861, but their proportion of the overall population declined from 33% to 17%.<ref>{{cite web |last= Phillips |first= Alberta |title= Proof of Austin's past is right there \u2013 in black and white |publisher= Austin American-Statesman |date= November 22, 2009 |url= http://www.statesman.com/opinion/proof-of-austins-past-is-right-there-in-78440.html?printArticle=y |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120910170654/http://www.statesman.com/opinion/proof-of-austins-past-is-right-there-in-78440.html?printArticle=y |archive-date= September 10, 2012 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAustin's Hispanic residents, who in 1900 numbered about 335 and composed just 1.5% of the population, rose to 11% by 1940, when they numbered 9,693. By the 1940s most [[Mexican-Americans]] lived in the rapidly expanding East Austin barrio south of East Eleventh Street, where increasing numbers owned homes. Hispanic-owned business were dominated by a thriving food industry. Though Mexican Americans encountered widespread discrimination\u2014in employment, housing, education, city services, and other areas\u2014it was by no means practiced as rigidly as it was toward African-Americans.\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1980s ethnic relations in Austin were transformed. First came a sustained attack on segregation. Local black leaders and political-action groups waged campaigns to desegregate city schools and services. In 1956 the [[University of Texas]] became the first major university in the South to admit blacks as undergraduates. In the early 1960s students staged demonstrations against segregated lunch counters, restaurants, and movie theaters. Gradually the barriers receded, a process accelerated when the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations. Nevertheless, discrimination persisted in areas like employment and housing. Shut out of the town's political leadership since the 1880s, when two blacks had served on the city council, African-Americans regained a foothold by winning a school-board seat in 1968 and a city-council seat in 1971. This political breakthrough was matched by Hispanics, whose numbers had reached 39,399 by 1970, or 16 percent of the population. Mexican-Americans won their first seats on the Austin school board in 1972 and the city council in 1975.\n\n===Growth during the Great Depression===\nDuring the early and mid-1930s, Austin experienced the harsh effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Nevertheless, the town fared comparatively well, sustained by its twin foundations of government and education and by the political skills of Mayor [[Robert Thomas Miller|Tom Miller]], who took office in 1933, and United States Congressman [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]], who won election to the U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1937. Its population grew at a faster pace during the 1930s than in any other decade during the 20th century, increasing 66 percent from 53,120 to 87,930. By 1936 the [[Public Works Administration]] had provided Austin with more funding for municipal construction projects than any other Texas city during the same period. UT nearly doubled its enrollment during the decade and undertook a massive construction program. In addition, the [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]] opened its doors for commercial air traffic in 1930.\n\nOver three decades after the original Austin Dam collapsed, Governor [[Miriam A. Ferguson|Miriam A. \"Ma\" Ferguson]] signed the bill that created the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] (LCRA). Modeled after the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], the LCRA is a nonprofit public utility involved in managing the resources along the [[Texas Highland Lakes|Highland Lakes]] and Colorado River. The old Austin Dam, partially rebuilt under Mayor Wooldridge but never finished due to damage from flooding in 1915, was finally completed in 1940 and renamed [[Tom Miller Dam]]. [[Lake Austin]] stretched twenty-one miles behind it. Just upriver the much larger [[Mansfield Dam]] was completed in 1941 to impound [[Lake Travis]]. The two dams, in conjunction with other dams in the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] system, brought great benefits to Austin: cheap hydroelectric power, the end of flooding that in 1935 and on earlier occasions had ravaged the town, and a plentiful supply of water without which the city's later growth would have been unlikely.<ref>{{cite web |title= LCRA and Central Texas since 1900 |publisher= Lower Colorado River Authority |url= http://www.lcra.org/about/overview/history/timeline/historycenter.html |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120220015003/http://www.lcra.org/about/overview/history/timeline/historycenter.html |archive-date= February 20, 2012 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref> In 1942 Austin gained the economic benefit of Del Valle Army Air Base, later [[Bergstrom Air Force Base]], which remained in operation until 1993.\n\n===Post-War growth and its consequences===\nFrom 1940 to 1990 Austin's population grew at an average rate of 40 percent per decade, from 87,930 to 472,020. By 2000 the population was 656,562. The city's corporate area, which between 1891 and 1940 had about doubled to 30.85 square miles, grew more than sevenfold to 225.40 square miles by 1990. During the 1950s and 1960s much of Austin's growth reflected the rapid expansion of its traditional strengths\u2014education and government. During the 1960s alone the number of students attending the University of Texas at Austin doubled, reaching 39,000 by 1970. Government employees in Travis County tripled between 1950 and 1970 to 47,300. University of Texas buildings multiplied, with the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library]] opening in 1971. A complex of state office buildings was constructed north of the Capitol. Propelling Austin's growth by the 1970s was its emergence as a center for high technology. This development, fostered by the Chamber of Commerce since the 1950s as a way to expand the city's narrow economic base and fueled by proliferating research programs at the University of Texas, accelerated when [[IBM]] located in Austin in 1967, followed by [[Texas Instruments]] in 1969 and [[Motorola]] in 1974. Two major research consortia of high-technology companies followed during the 1980s, [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation]] and [[Sematech]]. By the early 1990s, the [[Austin\u2013Round Rock\u2013San Marcos Metropolitan Statistical Area]] had about 400 high-technology manufacturers. While high-technology industries located on Austin's periphery, its central area sprouted multi-storied office buildings and hotels during the 1970s and 1980s, venues for the burgeoning music industry, and, in 1992, a new convention center.\n\nOn August 1, 1966, UT student and former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Charles Whitman]] killed both his wife and his mother before ascending the [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|UT Tower]] and opening fire with a high-powered sniper rifle and several other firearms. Whitman killed or fatally wounded 14 more people over the next 90 minutes before being shot dead by police.\n\n===1970 to 1989===\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the city experienced a tremendous boom in development that temporarily halted with the [[Savings and Loan crisis]] in the late 1980s. The growth led to an ongoing series of fierce political battles that pitted preservationists against developers. In particular the preservation of Barton Springs, and by extension the [[Edwards Aquifer]], became an issue that defined the themes of the larger battles.\n\nAustin's rapid growth generated strong resistance by the 1970s. Angered by proliferating apartment complexes and traffic flow, neighborhood groups mobilized to protect the integrity of their residential areas. By 1983 there were more than 150 such groups. Environmentalists organized a powerful movement to protect streams, lakes, watersheds, and wooded hills from environmental degradation, resulting in the passage of a series of environmental-protection ordinances during the 1970s and 1980s. A program was inaugurated in 1971 to beautify the shores of Town Lake (now named [[Lady Bird Lake]]), a downtown lake impounded in 1960 behind Longhorn Crossing Dam. Historic preservationists fought the destruction of Austin's architectural heritage by rescuing and restoring historic buildings. City election campaigns during the 1970s and 1980s frequently featured struggles over the management of growth, with neighborhood groups and environmentalists on one side and business and development interests on the other. As Austin became known as a location for creative individuals, corporate retail branches also moved into town and displaced many \"home-grown\" businesses. To many longtime Austinites, this loss of landmark retail establishments left a void in the city's culture. In the 1970s, Austin became a refuge for a group of [[American country music|country and western]] musicians and songwriters seeking to escape the music industry's corporate domination of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. The best-known artist in this group was [[Willie Nelson]], who became an icon for what became the city's \"alternate music industry\"; another was [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. In 1975, ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' premiered on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], showcasing Austin's burgeoning music scene to the country.\n\n[[File:ArmadilloWorldHQ.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Armadillo World Headquarters in 1976]]\nThe [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] gained a national reputation during the 1970s as a venue for these anti-establishment musicians as well as mainstream acts. In the following years, Austin gained a reputation as a place where struggling musicians could launch their careers in informal live venues in front of receptive audiences. This ultimately led to the city's official motto, \"The Live Music Capital of the World\".\n\n===1990 to present===\n{{update|section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Austin skyline 2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Downtown high-rises viewed from the west]]\nIn the 1990s, the boom resumed with the influx and growth of a large technology industry. Initially, the technology industry was centered around larger, established companies such as [[IBM]], but in the late 1990s, Austin gained the additional reputation of being a center of the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] and subsequent [[Early 2000s recession|dot-com bust]]. Austin is also known for [[game development]], filmmaking, and [[popular music]]. On May 23, 1999, [[Austin-Bergstrom International Airport]] served its first passengers, replacing [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]].<ref>[http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/01/25/25airport.html Austin airport has 2nd record year]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Austin American-Statesman'', January 25, 2007.</ref> In 2000, Austin became the center of an intense media focus as the headquarters of presidential candidate and Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]]. The headquarters of his main opponent, [[Al Gore]], were in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], thus re-creating the old country music rivalry between the two cities.\n\nAlso in the 2000 election, Austinites narrowly rejected a [[light rail]] proposal put forward by [[Capital Metro]]. In 2004, however, they approved a [[commuter rail]] service from [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] to downtown along existing rail lines. [[Capital MetroRail]] service finally began service in 2010.<ref>[http://allsystemsgo.capmetro.org/capital-metrorail.shtml Capital Metro: Capital MetroRail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524051914/http://allsystemsgo.capmetro.org/capital-metrorail.shtml |date=May 24, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the [[Frost Bank Tower]] opened in the downtown business district along [[Congress Avenue]].

The sudden growth has brought up several issues for the city, including [[urban sprawl]], as well as balancing the need for new infrastructure with environmental protection. Most recently, the city has pushed for [[smart growth]], mostly in downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods, spurring the development of new condominiums in the area and altering the city's skyline. While Smart Growth has been successful in revitalizing downtown and the surrounding central city neighborhoods housing development has not kept pace with demand driven by rapid and sustained employment growth which has resulted in higher housing costs.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Austin, Texas]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==Further reading==\n{{seealso|Timeline of Austin, Texas#Bibliography}}\n* Auyero, Javier.

They chose a site on the western frontier, after viewing it at the instruction of President Lamar, who visited the sparsely settled area in 1838. Lamar was a proponent of [[westward expansion]].

Waller chose a {{convert|640|acre|ha|adj=on}} site on a bluff above the Colorado River, nestled between Shoal Creek to the west and Waller Creek (which was named for him) to the east. Waller surveyed a [[grid plan]] on a single square-mile plot with 14 blocks running in both directions. One grand avenue, which Lamar named [[Congress Avenue|\"Congress\"]], cut through the center of town from Capitol Square down to the Colorado River. The streets running north-south (paralleling Congress) were named for Texas rivers with their order of placement matching the order of rivers on the Texas state map. The east-west streets were named after trees native to the region, despite the fact that Waller had recommended using numbers. (They were eventually changed to numbers in 1884.) The city's perimeters stretched north to south from the river at 1st Street to 15th Street, and from East Avenue (now [[Interstate 35]]) to West Avenue.<ref>{{cite book |first=Spurlin |last=Charles D. |journal= Handbook of Texas |title= Waller, Edwin |url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fwa38 |accessdate= September 6, 2011}}</ref> Much of this original design is still intact in downtown Austin today.\n\nIn October 1839, the entire government of the Republic of Texas arrived by [[Red River cart|oxcart]] from [[Houston]].

Lamar's successor as [[President of the Republic of Texas]], [[Sam Houston]], ordered the national archives transferred to Houston for safekeeping after Mexican troops captured San Antonio on March 5, 1842. Convinced that removal of the republic's diplomatic, financial, land, and military-service records was tantamount to choosing a new capital, Austinites refused to relinquish the archives. Houston moved the government anyway, first to Houston and then to [[Washington-on-the-Brazos]], which remained the seat of government until 1845. The archives stayed in Austin. When Houston sent a contingent of armed men to seize the [[Texas General Land Office|General Land Office]] records in December 1842, they were foiled by the citizens of Austin and [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] in an incident known as the [[Texas Archive War]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/republic/archwar/archwar.html |title= Texas Archives War |author= Texas State Library and Archives Commission |publisher= Texas State Library, Texas Treasures |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref> Deprived of its political function, Austin languished.

Forty-eight percent of Austin's family heads owned slaves. The city entered a period of accelerated growth following its decisive triumph in the 1850 election to determine the site of the state capital for the next twenty years. For the first time the government constructed permanent buildings, among them a new capitol at the head of [[Congress Avenue]], completed in 1853, and the [[Texas Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]], completed in 1856. State-run asylums for deaf, blind, and mentally ill Texans were erected on the fringes of town. Congregations of Baptists, Episcopalians, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Catholics erected permanent church buildings, and the town's elite built elegant [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] mansions. By 1860 the population had climbed to 3,546, including 1,019 slaves and twelve free blacks. That year thirty-five percent of Austin's family heads owned slaves.\n\nWhile Texas voted overwhelmingly to secede from the Union and join the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] in 1861, [[Travis County]] was one of a few counties in state to vote against the secession ordinance (704 to 450). However, Unionist sentiment waned once the war began. By April 1862 about 600 Austin and Travis County men had joined some twelve volunteer companies serving the Confederacy. Austinites followed with particular concern news of the successive Union thrusts toward Texas, but the town was never directly threatened. Like other communities, Austin experienced severe shortages of goods, spiraling inflation, and the decimation of its fighting men.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Greene |first= A.C. |year= 1969 |title= The Durable Society: Austin in the Reconstruction |journal= The Southwestern Historical Quarterly |volume= 72 |issue= 4 |pages= 492\u2013518 |publisher= Texas State Historical Association |jstor= 30236542 }}</ref> The end of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] brought Union occupation troops to the city and a period of explosive growth of the African-American population, which increased by 57 percent during the 1860s.

In the [[Downtown Austin|downtown]] area, the wooden wagon yards and saloons of the 1850s and 1860s began to be replaced by the more solid masonry structures still standing today. On December 25, 1871, a new era opened with the coming of the [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]], Austin's first railroad connection. By becoming the westernmost railroad terminus in Texas and the only railroad town for scores of miles in most directions, Austin was transformed into a trading center for a vast area. Construction boomed and the population more than doubled in five years to 10,363. The many foreign-born newcomers gave Austin's citizenry a more heterogeneous character. By 1875 there were 757 inhabitants from Germany, 297 from Mexico, 215 from Ireland, and 138 from Sweden. For the first time a [[Mexican-American]] community took root in Austin, in a neighborhood near the mouth of Shoal Creek. Accompanying these dramatic changes were civic improvements, among them gas street lamps in 1874, the first [[streetcar]] line in 1875, and the first elevated bridge across the Colorado River about 1876. Although a second railroad, the [[International \u2013 Great Northern Railroad|International and Great Northern]], reached Austin in 1876, the town's fortunes turned downward after 1875 as new railroads traversed Austin's trading region and diverted much of its trade to other towns. From 1875 to 1880 the city's population increased by only 650 inhabitants to 11,013.<ref>{{cite web |last= Cox |first= Mike |title= Austin as Texas' Capital |publisher= Texas Escapes |date= September 16, 2011 |url= http://www.texasescapes.com/MikeCoxTexasTales/Austin-as-Texas-Capital.htm |accessdate= November 23, 2011}}</ref> Austin's expectations of rivaling other Texas cities for economic leadership faded.\n\nHowever, Austin solidified its position as a political center during the 1870s, after the city prevailed in the 1872 statewide election to settle the state capital question once and for all. Three years later Texas took the first steps toward constructing a new [[Texas State Capitol]] that culminated in 1888 in the dedication of a magnificent granite building towering over the town. After a fire destroyed its predecessor in 1881, a nationwide design contest was held to determine who would build the current Capitol building. Architect [[Elijah E. Myers]], who built the Capitols of [[Michigan State Capitol|Michigan]] and [[Colorado State Capitol|Colorado]], won with a [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance Revival]] style. However, construction was held up for two years over a debate as to whether the exterior should be built from granite or limestone. It was eventually decided that it would be built of \"sunset red\" granite from [[Marble Falls, Texas|Marble Falls]]. Funded by the famous [[XIT Ranch]], the building remains part of the Austin skyline. The state capitol is smaller than the [[United States Capitol]] in total gross square footage, but is actually {{convert|15|ft|m}} taller than its Washington, D.C., counterpart.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Texas State Capitol |last= Cotner |first= Robert C. |year= 1968 |publisher= Pemberton Press |location= Austin |isbn= 0-292-73703-3 |pages= 15\u201317}}</ref>\n\nAnother statewide election in 1881 set the stage for Austin to become an educational and cultural hub as well, when it was chosen as the site for a new state university in a hotly contested election. A state constitution adopted in 1876 mandated that Texas establish a \"university of the first class\" to be located by vote of the people and styled the [[University of Texas]]. On September 6, 1881, Austin was chosen for the site of the main university and [[Galveston]] for the location of the medical department. In 1882 construction began on the Austin campus with the placement of the cornerstone of the [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|Main Building]]. The university held classes for the first time in 1883.<ref>{{cite web |last= Battle |first= William Janes |title= University of Texas at Austin |url= https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kcu09 |accessdate= November 23, 2011}}</ref> Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute, the forerunner of [[Huston-Tillotson University]], founded by the American Missionary Association to provide educational opportunities for African-Americans, opened its doors in East Austin by 1881.

[[Edward Sorin]] in 1878 on farmland in present-day south Austin. In 1885, the president, the Rev. P.&nbsp;J. Franciscus strengthened the prestige of the academy by securing a charter, changing its name to St. Edward's College, assembling a faculty, and increasing enrollment. Subsequently, St. Edward's began to grow, and the first school newspaper, the organization of baseball and football teams, and approval to erect an administration building all followed. Well-known architect [[Nicholas J. Clayton]] of Galveston was commissioned to design the college's Main Building, four stories tall and constructed with local white [[limestone]] in the [[Gothic Revival]], that was finished in 1888.<ref>{{cite web |title= St. Edward's University Celebrates Centennial of Main Building |publisher= St. Edward's University |date= October 8, 2003 |url= http://think.stedwards.edu/marketing/blog/post/st-edwards-university-celebrates-centennial-main-building |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222133607/http://think.stedwards.edu/marketing/blog/post/st-edwards-university-celebrates-centennial-main-building |archive-date= December 22, 2015 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOf note during this period were serial murders committed in 1884 and 1885 by an unidentified perpetrator known as the \"[[Servant Girl Annihilator]]\". According to some sources there were eight murders, seven women and one man, attributed to the serial killer, in addition to eight serious injuries. These occurred in a town that had only about 23,000 citizens total. The murders made national headlines, but only three years later [[London]] was plagued by [[Jack the Ripper]] overshadowing Austin's tragedy in the history books.<ref>{{cite magazine | title=Capital Murder | author=Hollandsworth, Skip | date=July 2000 | magazine=Texas Monthly | url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/capital-murder/}}</ref>\n\n==20th century==\n\n===Learning to live with the Colorado River===\nAustin's fortunes have been tied with the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] for much of its history, no more so than in the 1890s. At the urging of local civic leader [[Alexander P. Wooldridge]], the citizens of Austin voted overwhelmingly to put themselves deeply in debt to build a dam along the river to attract manufacturing. The hope was that cheap hydroelectricity would lure industrialists who would line the riverbanks with cotton mills. Austin would become \"the [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] of the South,\" and the sleepy center of government and education would be transformed into a bustling industrial city. The town had reached its limits as a seat of politics and education, Wooldridge contended, yet its economy could not sustain its present size. Empowered by a new city charter in 1891 that more than tripled Austin's corporate area from 4 \u00bd to 16 \u00bd square miles, the city fathers implemented a plan to build a municipal water and electric system, construct a dam for power, and lease most of the hydroelectric power to manufacturers. By 1893 the sixty-foot-high [[McDonald Dam failure|Austin Dam]] was completed just northwest of town. In 1895 dam-generated electricity began powering the four-year-old electric streetcar line and the city's new water and light systems. The dammed river formed a lake that became known as \"Lake McDonald,\" for John McDonald, the mayor who had whipped up support for the project\u2014attracted new residents and developers, while the waters of the lake itself drew those seeking respite from the Texas heat. Austin boomed in the mid-1890s, driven largely by land speculation. [[Monroe Shipe]] established [[Hyde Park Historic District (Austin, Texas)|Hyde Park]], a classic [[streetcar suburb]] north of downtown, and smaller developments sprang up around the city. Thirty-one new 165-foot-high [[moonlight towers]] illuminated Austin at night. Civic pride ran strong during those years, which also saw the city blessed with the talents of sculptor [[Elisabet Ney]] and writer [[O. Henry]].\n\nBy today's standards, the dam was unremarkable \u2013 a wall of granite and limestone, 65 feet high and 1,100 feet long, with no catwalk or floodgates. But [[Scientific American]] magazine was sufficiently impressed to feature the dam on its cover. However, structurally the dam was likely doomed from the start, as it was constructed on the spot where the [[Balcones Fault]] passes under the river. Silt had filled nearly half the lake by February 1900, and the dam's design failed to accommodate the force that could be created by a large volume of water. However, the flow of the Colorado proved to be far more variable than the project's promoters had claimed, and the dam was never able to produce the kind of steady power needed to drive a bank of mills. The manufacturers never came, periodic power shortfalls disrupted city services, Lake McDonald silted up, and, on April 7, 1900, the Austin Dam was dealt its final blow after a spring storm. At 11:20&nbsp;am, floodwaters crested at 11 feet atop the dam before it disintegrated, with two 250-foot sections \u2013 almost half the dam \u2013 breaking away. In all, the flood drowned 18 people and destroyed 100 houses in Austin, at a total estimated loss of $1.4 million, in 1900 dollars.<ref>{{cite web |last= Hunt |first= Bruce J. |title= The Rise and Fall of the Austin Dam |publisher= Not Even Past |date= July 13, 2011 |url= http://www.notevenpast.org/texas/rise-and-fall-austin-dam |accessdate= November 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1900, the people of Austin did what they could to recover from the disaster. Having gotten a taste of city-owned electric power, they refused to go back; they bought out the local private power company, which used steam-driven generators, and today's Austin Energy municipal utility is in a sense a legacy of the old Austin Dam. The city also tried to rebuild the dam itself, but a dispute with the contractor left the repairs unfinished in 1912, and another flood in 1915 damaged it further. The wrecked dam sat derelict, \"a tombstone on the river,\" until the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] stepped in and, with federal money, rebuilt it as [[Tom Miller Dam]], completed in 1940. The remaining portions of the 1893 and 1912 dams were incorporated into the new structure, but are now hidden under new layers of concrete.<ref>{{cite web |last= Spencer |first= Jim |title= First Austin Dam Collapse 110 Years Ago Today |publisher= KXAN Blogs |date= April 7, 2010 |url= http://blogs.kxan.com/2010/04/07/tom-miller-dam-turns-70/ |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107132723/http://blogs.kxan.com/2010/04/07/tom-miller-dam-turns-70/ |archive-date= November 7, 2011 |url-status= dead }}</ref> By the time it was finished, however, Tom Miller Dam was already overshadowed by the much larger LCRA dams built upstream that formed the [[Texas Highland Lakes]]. For the last seventy years, [[Lake Travis]] ([[Mansfield Dam]]) and [[Lake Buchanan (Texas)|Lake Buchanan]] ([[Buchanan Dam]]), have provided water, hydroelectric power, and flood control for Central Texas.\n\nBetween 1880 and 1920 Austin's population grew threefold to 34,876, but the city slipped from fourth largest in the state to tenth largest. The state's surging industrial development, propelled by the booming oil business, passed Austin by. The capital city began boosting itself as a residential city, but the heavy municipal indebtedness incurred in building the dam resulted in the neglect of city services. On December 20, 1886, the [[Driskill Hotel]] opened at [[6th Street (Austin)|6th]] and Brazos, giving Austin its first premier hotel. The hotel would close and reopen many times in subsequent years. In 1905 Austin had few sanitary sewers, virtually no public parks or playgrounds, and only one paved street. Three years later Austin voters overturned the [[alderman]] form of government, by which the city had been governed since 1839, and replaced it with commission government. Wooldridge headed the reform group voted into office in 1909 and served a decade as mayor, during which the city made steady if modest progress toward improving residential life. The [[Littlefield building|Littefield]] and [[Scarbrough building|Scarborough buildings]] at 6th and Congress downtown also opened that year, representing the city's first skyscrapers.<ref>{{cite web |last= Wermund |first= Ben |title= Littlefield, Scarbrough buildings mark a century in Austin |publisher= Austin American-Statesman |date= October 5, 2011 |url= http://www.statesman.com/news/local/littlefield-scarbrough-buildings-mark-a-century-in-austin-955944.html |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101013120919/http://www.statesman.com/news/local/littlefield-scarbrough-buildings-mark-a-century-in-austin-955944.html |archive-date= October 13, 2010 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref> In 1910, the city opened the concrete [[Ann W.

The fostered development south of the river for the first time, allowing for development of [[Travis Heights]] in 1913.\n\nIn 1918 the city acquired [[Barton Springs]], a spring-fed pool that became the symbol of the residential city. Upon Wooldridge's retirement in 1919 the flaws of commission government, hidden by his leadership, became apparent as city services again deteriorated. At the urging of the Chamber of Commerce, Austinites voted in 1924 to adopt [[council-manager government]], which went into effect in 1926 and remains in effect today. Progressive ideas like city planning and beautification became official city policy. A 1928 city plan, the first since 1839, called upon Austin to develop its strengths as a residential, cultural, and educational center. A $4,250,000 bond issue, Austin's largest to date, provided funds for streets, sewers, parks, the city hospital, the first permanent public library building, and the first municipal airport, which opened in 1930. A recreation department was established, and within a decade it offered Austinites a profusion of recreational programs, parks, and pools.<ref>{{cite web |title= History of Austin's Forms of Government |publisher= Office of the City Clerk, City of Austin |year= 1995 |url= http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/election/formsgov.htm |accessdate= November 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Race and the 1928 City Plan===\n[[File:Austin TX 1920 map.jpg|thumb|Map of Austin 1920]]\nBy the early years of the 20th century, African-Americans occupied settlements in various parts of the city of Austin.

Though surrounded by Anglo neighborhoods, these island enclaves functioned as fairly autonomous residential neighborhoods often organized around family ties, common religious practices, and connection to pre-emancipation slave-status relationships with common slave holders/land owners. Though some date back to slavery, by the 1920s these communities were located across the city and include Kincheonville (1865), Wheatville (1867), [[Clarksville Historic District (Austin, Texas)|Clarksville]] (1871), Masonville, St. Johns, Pleasant Hill, and other settlements.<ref>{{cite web |title= Hoe East Austin Became a Negro District |publisher= East End Cultural Heritage District & Diverse Arts |year= 2010 |url= http://diversearts.microassistdemo.com/politics-civic-engagement/how-east-austin-became-negro-district |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001420/http://diversearts.microassistdemo.com/politics-civic-engagement/how-east-austin-became-negro-district |archive-date= April 26, 2012 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nWhile residences of blacks had been widely scattered all across the city in 1880, by 1930 they were heavily concentrated in East Austin, a process encouraged by the 1928 City Plan, which recommended that East Austin be designated a \"Negro district.\" City officials implemented the plan successfully, and most blacks who had been living in the western half of the city were \"relocated\" back to the former plantation lands, on the other side of East Avenue (now [[Interstate 35]]). Municipal services like schools, sewers, and parks were made available to blacks in East Austin only. At mid-century Austin was still segregated in most respects\u2014housing, restaurants, hotels, parks, hospitals, schools, public transportation\u2014but African Americans had long fostered their own institutions, which included by the late 1940s some 150 small businesses, more than thirty churches, and two colleges, Tillotson College and Samuel Huston College. Between 1880 and 1940 the number of black residents grew from 3,587 to 14,861, but their proportion of the overall population declined from 33% to 17%.<ref>{{cite web |last= Phillips |first= Alberta |title= Proof of Austin's past is right there \u2013 in black and white |publisher= Austin American-Statesman |date= November 22, 2009 |url= http://www.statesman.com/opinion/proof-of-austins-past-is-right-there-in-78440.html?printArticle=y |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20120910170654/http://www.statesman.com/opinion/proof-of-austins-past-is-right-there-in-78440.html?printArticle=y |archive-date= September 10, 2012 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAustin's Hispanic residents, who in 1900 numbered about 335 and composed just 1.5% of the population, rose to 11% by 1940, when they numbered 9,693. By the 1940s most [[Mexican-Americans]] lived in the rapidly expanding East Austin barrio south of East Eleventh Street, where increasing numbers owned homes. Hispanic-owned business were dominated by a thriving food industry. Though Mexican Americans encountered widespread discrimination\u2014in employment, housing, education, city services, and other areas\u2014it was by no means practiced as rigidly as it was toward African-Americans.\n\nBetween the 1950s and 1980s ethnic relations in Austin were transformed. First came a sustained attack on segregation. Local black leaders and political-action groups waged campaigns to desegregate city schools and services. In 1956 the [[University of Texas]] became the first major university in the South to admit blacks as undergraduates. In the early 1960s students staged demonstrations against segregated lunch counters, restaurants, and movie theaters. Gradually the barriers receded, a process accelerated when the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed racial discrimination in public accommodations. Nevertheless, discrimination persisted in areas like employment and housing. Shut out of the town's political leadership since the 1880s, when two blacks had served on the city council, African-Americans regained a foothold by winning a school-board seat in 1968 and a city-council seat in 1971. This political breakthrough was matched by Hispanics, whose numbers had reached 39,399 by 1970, or 16 percent of the population. Mexican-Americans won their first seats on the Austin school board in 1972 and the city council in 1975.\n\n===Growth during the Great Depression===\nDuring the early and mid-1930s, Austin experienced the harsh effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Nevertheless, the town fared comparatively well, sustained by its twin foundations of government and education and by the political skills of Mayor [[Robert Thomas Miller|Tom Miller]], who took office in 1933, and United States Congressman [[Lyndon Baines Johnson]], who won election to the U.S. [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1937. Its population grew at a faster pace during the 1930s than in any other decade during the 20th century, increasing 66 percent from 53,120 to 87,930. By 1936 the [[Public Works Administration]] had provided Austin with more funding for municipal construction projects than any other Texas city during the same period. UT nearly doubled its enrollment during the decade and undertook a massive construction program. In addition, the [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]] opened its doors for commercial air traffic in 1930.\n\nOver three decades after the original Austin Dam collapsed, Governor [[Miriam A. Ferguson|Miriam A. \"Ma\" Ferguson]] signed the bill that created the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] (LCRA). Modeled after the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], the LCRA is a nonprofit public utility involved in managing the resources along the [[Texas Highland Lakes|Highland Lakes]] and Colorado River. The old Austin Dam, partially rebuilt under Mayor Wooldridge but never finished due to damage from flooding in 1915, was finally completed in 1940 and renamed [[Tom Miller Dam]]. [[Lake Austin]] stretched twenty-one miles behind it. Just upriver the much larger [[Mansfield Dam]] was completed in 1941 to impound [[Lake Travis]]. The two dams, in conjunction with other dams in the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] system, brought great benefits to Austin: cheap hydroelectric power, the end of flooding that in 1935 and on earlier occasions had ravaged the town, and a plentiful supply of water without which the city's later growth would have been unlikely.<ref>{{cite web |title= LCRA and Central Texas since 1900 |publisher= Lower Colorado River Authority |url= http://www.lcra.org/about/overview/history/timeline/historycenter.html |accessdate= November 23, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120220015003/http://www.lcra.org/about/overview/history/timeline/historycenter.html |archive-date= February 20, 2012 |url-status= dead |df= mdy-all }}</ref> In 1942 Austin gained the economic benefit of Del Valle Army Air Base, later [[Bergstrom Air Force Base]], which remained in operation until 1993.\n\n===Post-War growth and its consequences===\nFrom 1940 to 1990 Austin's population grew at an average rate of 40 percent per decade, from 87,930 to 472,020. By 2000 the population was 656,562. The city's corporate area, which between 1891 and 1940 had about doubled to 30.85 square miles, grew more than sevenfold to 225.40 square miles by 1990. During the 1950s and 1960s much of Austin's growth reflected the rapid expansion of its traditional strengths\u2014education and government. During the 1960s alone the number of students attending the University of Texas at Austin doubled, reaching 39,000 by 1970. Government employees in Travis County tripled between 1950 and 1970 to 47,300. University of Texas buildings multiplied, with the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library]] opening in 1971. A complex of state office buildings was constructed north of the Capitol. Propelling Austin's growth by the 1970s was its emergence as a center for high technology. This development, fostered by the Chamber of Commerce since the 1950s as a way to expand the city's narrow economic base and fueled by proliferating research programs at the University of Texas, accelerated when [[IBM]] located in Austin in 1967, followed by [[Texas Instruments]] in 1969 and [[Motorola]] in 1974. Two major research consortia of high-technology companies followed during the 1980s, [[Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation]] and [[Sematech]]. By the early 1990s, the [[Austin\u2013Round Rock\u2013San Marcos Metropolitan Statistical Area]] had about 400 high-technology manufacturers. While high-technology industries located on Austin's periphery, its central area sprouted multi-storied office buildings and hotels during the 1970s and 1980s, venues for the burgeoning music industry, and, in 1992, a new convention center.\n\nOn August 1, 1966, UT student and former [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] [[Charles Whitman]] killed both his wife and his mother before ascending the [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|UT Tower]] and opening fire with a high-powered sniper rifle and several other firearms. Whitman killed or fatally wounded 14 more people over the next 90 minutes before being shot dead by police.\n\n===1970 to 1989===\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the city experienced a tremendous boom in development that temporarily halted with the [[Savings and Loan crisis]] in the late 1980s. The growth led to an ongoing series of fierce political battles that pitted preservationists against developers. In particular the preservation of Barton Springs, and by extension the [[Edwards Aquifer]], became an issue that defined the themes of the larger battles.\n\nAustin's rapid growth generated strong resistance by the 1970s. Angered by proliferating apartment complexes and traffic flow, neighborhood groups mobilized to protect the integrity of their residential areas. By 1983 there were more than 150 such groups. Environmentalists organized a powerful movement to protect streams, lakes, watersheds, and wooded hills from environmental degradation, resulting in the passage of a series of environmental-protection ordinances during the 1970s and 1980s. A program was inaugurated in 1971 to beautify the shores of Town Lake (now named [[Lady Bird Lake]]), a downtown lake impounded in 1960 behind Longhorn Crossing Dam. Historic preservationists fought the destruction of Austin's architectural heritage by rescuing and restoring historic buildings. City election campaigns during the 1970s and 1980s frequently featured struggles over the management of growth, with neighborhood groups and environmentalists on one side and business and development interests on the other. As Austin became known as a location for creative individuals, corporate retail branches also moved into town and displaced many \"home-grown\" businesses. To many longtime Austinites, this loss of landmark retail establishments left a void in the city's culture. In the 1970s, Austin became a refuge for a group of [[American country music|country and western]] musicians and songwriters seeking to escape the music industry's corporate domination of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. The best-known artist in this group was [[Willie Nelson]], who became an icon for what became the city's \"alternate music industry\"; another was [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]]. In 1975, ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' premiered on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], showcasing Austin's burgeoning music scene to the country.\n\n[[File:ArmadilloWorldHQ.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Armadillo World Headquarters in 1976]]\nThe [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] gained a national reputation during the 1970s as a venue for these anti-establishment musicians as well as mainstream acts. In the following years, Austin gained a reputation as a place where struggling musicians could launch their careers in informal live venues in front of receptive audiences. This ultimately led to the city's official motto, \"The Live Music Capital of the World\".\n\n===1990 to present===\n{{update|section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Austin skyline 2.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Downtown high-rises viewed from the west]]\nIn the 1990s, the boom resumed with the influx and growth of a large technology industry. Initially, the technology industry was centered around larger, established companies such as [[IBM]], but in the late 1990s, Austin gained the additional reputation of being a center of the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] and subsequent [[Early 2000s recession|dot-com bust]]. Austin is also known for [[game development]], filmmaking, and [[popular music]]. On May 23, 1999, [[Austin-Bergstrom International Airport]] served its first passengers, replacing [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]].<ref>[http://www.statesman.com/business/content/business/stories/other/01/25/25airport.html Austin airport has 2nd record year]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''Austin American-Statesman'', January 25, 2007.</ref> In 2000, Austin became the center of an intense media focus as the headquarters of presidential candidate and Texas Governor [[George W. Bush]]. The headquarters of his main opponent, [[Al Gore]], were in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], thus re-creating the old country music rivalry between the two cities.\n\nAlso in the 2000 election, Austinites narrowly rejected a [[light rail]] proposal put forward by [[Capital Metro]]. In 2004, however, they approved a [[commuter rail]] service from [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] to downtown along existing rail lines. [[Capital MetroRail]] service finally began service in 2010.<ref>[http://allsystemsgo.capmetro.org/capital-metrorail.shtml Capital Metro: Capital MetroRail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524051914/http://allsystemsgo.capmetro.org/capital-metrorail.shtml |date=May 24, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, the [[Frost Bank Tower]] opened in the downtown business district along [[Congress Avenue]]. At {{convert|515|ft|m}}, it was the tallest building in Austin by a wide margin, and was also the first high rise to be built after September 11, 2001. Several other high-rise downtown projects, most residential or mixed-use, were underway in the downtown area at the time, dramatically changing the appearance of downtown Austin, and placing a new emphasis on downtown living and development.<ref name=\"Opening\">{{cite web|title=Cousins Properties Opens Frost Bank Tower in Austin |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/real-estate/commercial-residential-property/5218250-1.html|publisher=AllBusiness.com|accessdate=2010-04-29}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, the first sections of Austin's first [[toll road]] network opened. The toll roads were extolled as a solution to underfunded highway projects, but also decried by opposition groups who felt the tolls amounted in some cases to a double tax.\n\nIn March 2018, a [[Austin serial bombings|series of four explosions]] centered in Austin, killed two civilians and injuring another five.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/03/18/two-injured-in-explosion-in-austin-police-say/|title=Fourth Austin package explosion this month possibly detonated by trip wire, leaving 2 injured, police say|last=Moravec|first=Eva Ruth|date=2018-03-19|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-19|last2=Flynn|first2=Meagan|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>\n\nPresently, Austin continues to rise in popularity and experience rapid growth. Young people in particular have flooded the city, drawn in part by its relatively strong economy, its reputation of [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] politics<ref>{{Cite news |title=Austin pubs could go smoke-free |publisher=[[San Antonio Express-News]] |date=May 3, 2008 |url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/MYSA050405_3B_austin_smoking_23c7aa15b_html4518.html |accessdate=2009-07-08 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and [[alternative culture]] in [[Midwestern United States|Middle America]], and its relatively low housing costs compared to the coastal regions of the country. The sudden growth has brought up several issues for the city, including [[urban sprawl]], as well as balancing the need for new infrastructure with environmental protection. Most recently, the city has pushed for [[smart growth]], mostly in downtown and the surrounding neighborhoods, spurring the development of new condominiums in the area and altering the city's skyline. While Smart Growth has been successful in revitalizing downtown and the surrounding central city neighborhoods housing development has not kept pace with demand driven by rapid and sustained employment growth which has resulted in higher housing costs.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Austin, Texas]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n==Further reading==\n{{seealso|Timeline of Austin, Texas#Bibliography}}\n* Auyero, Javier.

A [[division (military)|division]] of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops in the [[Army of the Frontier]] commanded by [[James G. Blunt]] was posted in northwestern [[Arkansas]] after winning the [[Battle of Cane Hill]]. A [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] army commanded by [[Thomas Hindman]] moved towards Blunt's division in order to attack it while it was isolated. However, Blunt was reinforced by two divisions commanded by [[Francis J. Herron]], leading Hindman to take a defense position on some high ground known as Prairie Grove. Herron attempted to assault Hindman's lines twice, but both attacks were beaten off with heavy casualties. Hindman responded to the repulse of each of Herron's attacks with an unsuccessful [[counterattack]] of his own. Later in the day, Blunt arrived and attacked Hindman's [[flank (military)|flank]]. Eventually, both sides disengaged and the fighting reached an inconclusive result. However, the unavailability of reinforcements forced Hindman's army to retreat from the field, giving the Union army a strategic victory and control of northwestern Arkansas. Today, a portion of the battlefield is preserved within [[Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park]].\n\n==Background==\nIn March 1862, a Confederate army under the command of [[Earl Van Dorn]] engaged a Union army led by [[Samuel Ryan Curtis]] at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in northwestern Arkansas. Curtis' army soundly defeated Van Dorn's. After being defeated at Pea Ridge, Van Dorn and a substantial portion of his army were reassigned across the [[Mississippi River]], effectively ending Confederate control of the region.{{sfn|Shea|Hess|1992|pp=307\u2013308}}\n\nFollowing Pea Ridge, Curtis drove further into Arkansas, but was ordered by [[Henry Halleck]] to send half of his force to [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]]. Curtis complied, but was forced to abandon his plan to attack [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Instead, he decided to strike towards [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].{{sfn|Shea|Hess|1992|p=295}} After a defeat in [[Battle of Whitney's Lane|a small action]] near [[Searcy, Arkansas]], Curtis decided that his supply line was vulnerable, and fell back, eventually reaching [[Helena, Arkansas]].{{sfn|Shea|Hess|1992|pp=299\u2013302}}\n\nIn September, Curtis was assigned to command the [[Department of the Missouri]], replacing its previous commander, [[John M. Schofield]].{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=20\u201321}} Curtis later formed the [[Army of the Frontier]], and appointed Schofield to command the new army.{{sfn|Shea|2009|p=29}} However, Schofield would be forced to give up command of the army due to medical issues, and command passed to [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[James G. Blunt]].{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=71\u201372}} At the time of Schofield's relinquishment of command, Blunt's division was in Arkansas, while the rest of the Army of the Frontier was stationed near [[Wilsons Creek (Missouri)|Wilson's Creek]] in Missouri, where [[Battle of Wilson's Creek|a battle]] had been fought the year before.{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nThe Confederate commander in the region, [[Thomas C. Hindman]], had previously commanded the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]], but his firm control of the region led to protests from prominent Arkansas civilians, leading [[Jefferson Davis]], [[President of the Confederate States of America]], to relieve Hindman of command and replace him with [[Theophilus Holmes]].{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=4\u20139}} Holmes later tasked Hindman with producing an organized army from the Confederate units in the Arkansas region and moving to regain control of Missouri for the Confederacy.{{sfn|Shea|2009|p=12}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{{further|Prairie Grove Union order of battle}}\n[[File:FJHerron.jpg|thumb|75px|Francis J. Herron]]\n\nAt the beginning of the Prairie Grove campaign, the Union Army of the Frontier was commanded by John M. Schofield. Schofield's army was divided into three divisions, commanded by James G. Blunt, [[James Totten]], and Francis Herron. Blunt's division was known as the 'Kansas Division', as many of the soldiers in the division were from Kansas. The division also contained sizable numbers of [[Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War|African American soldiers]] and [[Native Americans in the American Civil War|Native American soldiers]], which made Blunt's division unique among Union units in 1862. Totten's and Herron's divisions were both known as the 'Missouri Division', and contained men from [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Indiana]]. The division also contained a regiment of Arkansas cavalrymen who had remained loyal to the Union despite the [[Arkansas in the American Civil War#The Ordinance of Secession|secession of Arkansas]]. On October 12, 1862, this force was officially organized under the command of Schofield and named the [[Army of the Frontier]].{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=22{{endash}}29}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{further|Prairie Grove Confederate order of battle}}\n[[File:Hindman, Thomas Carmichael, 1828-1868-full.jpg|thumb|75px|Thomas Hindman]]\n\nThe Confederate army present at Prairie Grove was the [[Trans-Mississippi Army]], commanded by Thomas Hindman. Hindman's command was formed of four [[division (military)|divisions]]: one of cavalry, one of infantry, and a mixed reserve division. The cavalry division consisted of men from [[Arkansas]], [[Texas]], and [[Confederate Missouri]], and was commanded by [[John S. Marmaduke]]. Marmaduke's division was poorly armed. The army's two divisions were commanded by [[Daniel M. Frost]] and [[Francis Shoup]]. Shoup's division consisted of Arkansas infantrymen, and Frost's division was mostly Missourians, although some Arkansas troops were included. The reserve division was commanded by [[John S. Roane]], and was poorly equipped, organized, and led (Theophilus Holmes stated that Roane was \"useless as a commander\"). Of Hindman and his division commanders, all had previous military experience, and Hindman, Frost, and Roane had seen action in the [[Mexican-American War]].{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=85{{endash}}88}}\n\n==Maneuvering to battle==\n[[File:Prairie_Grove_Battlefield_Arkansas.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Prairie Grove Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nIn October, Blunt's force made an incursion into Arkansas, and Hindman sent 2,000 men under Marmaduke's command to intercept Blunt and prevent Blunt from joining the main Union force near [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Marmaduke gathered at Cane Hill, a ridge near the [[Boston Mountains]].

A [[division (military)|division]] of [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] troops in the [[Army of the Frontier]] commanded by [[James G. Blunt]] was posted in northwestern [[Arkansas]] after winning the [[Battle of Cane Hill]].  A [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] army commanded by [[Thomas Hindman]] moved towards Blunt's division in order to attack it while it was isolated.  However, Blunt was reinforced by two divisions commanded by [[Francis J. Herron]], leading Hindman to take a defense position on some high ground known as Prairie Grove.  Herron attempted to assault Hindman's lines twice, but both attacks were beaten off with heavy casualties.  Hindman responded to the repulse of each of Herron's attacks with an unsuccessful [[counterattack]] of his own.  Later in the day, Blunt arrived and attacked Hindman's [[flank (military)|flank]].  Eventually, both sides disengaged and the fighting reached an inconclusive result.  However, the unavailability of reinforcements forced Hindman's army to retreat from the field, giving the Union army a strategic victory and control of northwestern Arkansas.  Today, a portion of the battlefield is preserved within [[Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park]].\n\n==Background==\nIn March 1862, a Confederate army under the command of [[Earl Van Dorn]] had engaged a Union army led by [[Samuel Ryan Curtis]] at the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in northwestern Arkansas.  Curtis' army soundly defeated Van Dorn.  After his defeat at Pea Ridge, Van Dorn and a substantial portion of his army were reassigned across the [[Mississippi River]], effectively ending Confederate control of the region.{{sfn|Shea|Hess|1992|pp=307\u2013308}}\n\nFollowing Pea Ridge, Curtis drove further into Arkansas, but was order by [[Henry Halleck]] to send half of his force to [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]].  Curtis complied, but was forced to abandon his plan to attack [[Memphis, Tennessee]].  Instead, he decided to strike towards [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].{{sfn|Shea|Hess|1992|p=295}}  After a defeat in [[Battle of Whitney's Lane|a small action]] near [[Searcy, Arkansas]], Curtis decided that his supply line was vulnerable.  Curtis then fell back, eventually reaching [[Helena, Arkansas]].{{sfn|Shea|Hess|1992|pp=299\u2013302}}\n\nIn September, Curtis was assigned to command the [[Department of the Missouri]], replacing its previous commander, [[John M. Schofield]].{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=20\u201321}} Curtis would later form the [[Army of the Frontier]], and appointed Schofield to command the new army.{{sfn|Shea|2009|p=29}}  However, Schofield would be forced to give up command of the army due to medical issues, and command passed to [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[James G. Blunt]].{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=71\u201372}} At the time of Schofield's relinquishment of command, Blunt's division was in Arkansas, while the rest of the Army of the Frontier was stationed near [[Wilsons Creek (Missouri)|Wilson's Creek]] in Missouri, where [[Battle of Wilson's Creek|a battle]] had been fought the year before.{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=72\u201373}}\n\nThe Confederate commander in the region, [[Thomas C. Hindman]], had previously commanded the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]], but his firm control of the region led to protests from prominent Arkansas civilians, leading [[Jefferson Davis]], [[President of the Confederate States of America]], to relieve Hindman of command and replace him with [[Theophilus Holmes]].{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=4\u20139}}  Holmes later tasked Hindman with producing an organized army from the Confederate units in the Arkansas region and moving to regain control of Missouri for the Confederacy.{{sfn|Shea|2009|p=12}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n===Union===\n{{further|Prairie Grove Union order of battle}}\n[[File:FJHerron.jpg|thumb|75px|Francis J. Herron]]\n\nAt the beginning of the Prairie Grove campaign, the Union Army of the Frontier was commanded by John M. Schofield.  Schofield's army was divided into three divisions, commanded by James G. Blunt, [[James Totten]], and Francis Herron.  Blunt's division was known as the Kansas Division, as many of the soldiers in the division were from Kansas.  The division also contained sizable numbers of [[Military history of African Americans in the American Civil War|African American soldiers]] and [[Native Americans in the American Civil War|Native American soldiers]], which made Blunt's division unique among Union units in 1862.  Totten's and Herron's divisions were both known as the Missouri Divisions, and contained men from [[Illinois]], [[Iowa]], [[Missouri]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Indiana]].  The division also contained a regiment of Arkansas cavalrymen who had remained loyal to the Union despite the [[Arkansas in the American Civil War#The Ordinance of Secession|secession of Arkansas]].  On October 12, 1862, this force was officially organized under the command of Schofield and named the [[Army of the Frontier]].{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=22{{endash}}29}}\n\n===Confederate===\n{{further|Prairie Grove Confederate order of battle}}\n[[File:Hindman, Thomas Carmichael, 1828-1868-full.jpg|thumb|75px|Thomas Hindman]]\n\nThe Confederate army present at Prairie Grove, the [[Trans-Mississippi Army]], was commanded by Thomas Hindman.  Hindman's command was formed of four [[division (military)|divisions]]: one of cavalry, one of infantry, and a mixed reserve division.  The cavalry division consisted of men from [[Arkansas]], [[Texas]], and [[Confederate Missouri]], and was commanded by [[John S. Marmaduke]].  Marmaduke's division was rather poorly armed.  The army's two divisions were commanded by [[Daniel M. Frost]] and [[Francis Shoup]].  Shoup's division consisted of Arkansas infantrymen, and Frost's division was mostly Missourians, although some Arkansas troops were included.  The reserve division was commanded by [[John S. Roane]], and was poorly equipped, organized, and led (Theophilus Holmes stated that Roane was \"useless as a commander\").  Of Hindman and his division commanders, all had previous military experience, and Hindman, Frost, and Roane had seen action in the [[Mexican-American War]].{{sfn|Shea|2009|pp=85{{endash}}88}}\n\n==Maneuvering to battle==\n[[File:Prairie_Grove_Battlefield_Arkansas.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Prairie Grove Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nIn October, Blunt's force made an incursion into Arkansas, and Hindman sent 2,000 men under Marmaduke's command to intercept Blunt and ideally prevent Blunt from joining the main Union force near [[Springfield, Missouri]].  Marmaduke gathered at Cane Hill, a ridge near the [[Boston Mountains]].  In response, Blunt marched his troops 35 miles in two days, meeting Marmaduke's force near [[Canehill, Arkansas]].  In the ensuing [[Battle of Cane Hill]], which took place on November 28, Blunt's 5,000 men defeated Marmaduke's 2,000 in a nine-hour battle.{{sfn|Kennedy|1998|p=140}}\n\nAfter the Cane Hill fight, Hindman decided to send his entire army towards Cane Hill in order to assault Blunt.

Less than a year after it began, with the [[Unity (comics)|Unity]] crossover and quality storytelling bringing attention to Valiant books, back issue prices rose dramatically due to limited early print runs. With comic book speculators buying multiple copies of each issue, sales reached as high as 800,000 copies for ''X-O Manowar'' #0 (August 1993) before dropping off. This original series ran for 68 issues before being canceled after the Sept. 1996 issue, of which only approximately 14,000 were printed.<ref>[http://www.valiantfan.com/valiant/title.asp?tc=x&u=1 X-O MANOWAR COMIC COVER LIBRARY AND DATABASE], ValiantFans.com</ref>\n\nIssues #1\u20134 of the original ''X-O Manowar'' series were reprinted in a trade paperback, ''X-O Manowar: Retribution'', which sold over 150,000 copies. Issues #7 and #8 were reprinted as part of the ''[[Unity (comics)|Unity Saga]]'' trade paperbacks.\n\n===Acclaim Comics era===\nIn 1996, [[Acclaim Entertainment]] bought Valiant for $65 million and restarted the series under the Acclaim Comics banner. The publication of the second series ceased (along with all of Acclaim's non-core business) in 2002 due to Acclaim's financial difficulties in their video game division.\n\n===Valiant Entertainment===\nIn April, 2008, the recently formed Valiant Entertainment released ''X-O Manowar: Birth'', a deluxe hardcover collection collecting the first seven issues of ''X-O Manowar''. The collection was digitally recolored and \"remastered\" from the original material and included a new story, \"The Rise of Lydia,\" by Bob Layton, one the title's original artists. A press release from Valiantfans.com stated:\n\n<blockquote>''X-O Manowar: Birth'' (FEB084088), published by Valiant Entertainment, is solicited in the February Previews (Volume XVIII #2) and scheduled to arrive in comic book stores nationwide on April 30, 2008. This digitally re-colored and re-mastered special edition collects the full X-O Manowar origin story from issues #0\u20136 for the first time ever, and includes an all-new epic \"The Rise of Lydia\" story by comics legend Bob Layton and a new cover by Sean Chen! Aric of Dacia is a Visigoth barbarian captured by spider aliens and enslaved aboard their starship until he steals their ultimate weapon \u2013 the X-O Manowar armor. Aric returns to Earth only to find that 1600 years have past. Now the most primitive man on the planet wields the most technologically advanced weapon in existence! Features explosive art by [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] and Marvel EIC [[Joe Quesada]] and a story by legendary creators [[Bob Layton]] and [[Jim Shooter]]!

Raised under the oppressive thumb of the Roman Empire in fifth century Europe, his entire life was a never-ending series of campaigns against Rome, until a far more terrifying enemy came into play: the brutal race and alien colonizers known as the Vine. Abducted during a midnight scouting raid and taken to the far reaches of space, Aric and his fellow Visigoth captives lived their lives as slaves to the Vine, with no hope of escape.\n\nAfter several years of captivity aboard a Vine colony ship, Aric led a revolt against his alien captors, storming the hallowed temple of the Vine and stealing their most powerful relic, Shanhara, the sentient X-O Manowar armor. Aric bonded with the armor\u2014the first being in living memory to survive the process\u2014and turned the Vine's most powerful weapon against them. But a crushing counterattack by the Vine left many of Aric's allies dead or dying. Inexperienced with the armor himself, Aric barely escaped the Vine fleet before rocketing back to Earth.\n\nUpon his return, Aric learned that due to the effects of time dilation, 1,600 years has passed since his abduction and he was now stranded in the 21st century. Distraught by the loss of his family and people, Aric secluded himself in the Peruvian jungle, but the Vine were unwilling to leave their most sacred relic in human hands. Vine legend told that their greatest champion would one day wear the armor; news of a human controlling the suit could spell massive civil unrest for their empire.\n\nTo recover it, covert Vine agents called \"plantings\" left on Earth hundreds of years ago and modified to appear human, recruited the super spy [[Ninjak]] to kill Aric and return the armor. But with the help of Alexander Dorian, Aric turned Ninjak against his alien masters and led an attack on the Vine's secret headquarters inside Britain's MI-6, virtually eliminating the plantings' operations in England.\n\nThe Vine, however, responded with a full force invasion, one that proved to be no match for the X-O Manowar armor. However, Aric realized that there would be no peace with the Vine until they were destroyed. Commandeering a Vine ship, Aric mounted a one-man invasion of the alien race's home world, Loam, toppling the empire and freeing thousands in the process, including a populations of enslaved Visigoths descended from Aric's own people.\n\nReturning to Earth with his new kinsmen in tow, Aric decided to reestablish an ancestral Visigoth homeland in its present-day location within Romania, a decision which quickly drew the ire of the neighboring Russian government. After warding off a series of coordinated military strikes, Aric was faced with his greatest threat yet, the super-team known as Unity.\n\nAric's defense of Dacia did not go to plan. He was beaten by Toyo Harada, stripped of his armor, and taken into custody by the United States Military Reconnaissance Outpost (M.E.R.O.), a covert government agency that monitors and engages alien threats. In exchange for asylum for him and his people, Aric, now reunited with the X-O Manowar armor, works as an agent of M.E.R.O., protecting American interests on and above the Earth.\n\n===Characters===\n\n====Shanhara (X-O Manowar Armor)====\n\nAccording to legend, the sentient X-O Manowar armor known as Shanhara grew from a secret plant eons ago on the alien empire's home world of Loa. During the Vine's persecution at the hands of a mysterious race known as the Torment, it bonded with its first Vine Host, who went on to use its might to single-handedly repel the invasion force and win freedom for his people. The armor is living, composed of organics and exotic metals\u2014a mutualistic symbiotic, bonded to its host. For centuries, the Vine high priests searched for a wearer that could bear the power of Shanhara, but all such candidates were killed in the process. When Aric of Dacia attempted to escape the Vine Captivity, he bonded with Shanhara as a last resort and was deemed worthy.\n\nAric and Shanhara share a unique relationship\u2014one that continues even when they are separated. Shanhara can translate foreign and alien languages, tap into a world's historical and geographical records, interface with complex forms of technology, and even heal life-threatening injuries and illnesses. Even though the bond between Aric and the armor is strong, it can be severed. Recently, the Harbinger Foundation teletechnopath Livewire was able to override the armor's connection to Aric and wear Shanhara for a limited period. Despite its impact on earthly affairs, the armor's true origin and purpose remain a mystery-one that the beings known as the Armor Hunters will soon expose.\n\n===Original version===\nAric of [[Dacia]] was a [[Visigoth]] born in the 5th century [[AD]] under [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule. As a young boy, Aric witnessed the slaughter of his parents at the hands of Roman soldiers. Henceforth, he dedicated himself to destroying the Roman oppressors, with the help of his Uncle, [[Alaric I]].\n\nSome years later, Aric took a [[Celt]]ic [[Slavery|slave]], Deidre, to be his consort. He grew to love her, and worshipped her god, [[Lugh]]. One evening, he saw [[Spider Aliens|demons]] attacking members of his [[tribe]]. Aric attacked them, but was quickly subdued and taken aboard their [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] spacecraft.\n\nFor the next seven years, Aric was held prisoner in the slave pens of the spacecraft. At a refuelling station several [[light year]]s from [[Earth]], he befriended a man known as the \"Map Giver,\" who looked similar to [[Elvis Presley]]. The \"Map Giver\" used a discarded bone shard to carve a map into Aric's palm that would lead him to the alien's armory. Aric fought his way to the X-O Manowar class armor and donned the control ring. It later became clear that the \"manufacturing\" process of the X-O Manowar armor, which not only self-repaired, but also reproduced, involved the absorption of a sentient intelligence that then became the armor's own sentience. With this living armor he was able to escape from the alien ship and return to Earth.\n\n[[File:5.2.12RobertVendittiByLuigiNovi7.jpg|thumb|left|Writer [[Robert Venditti]] signing copies of Valiant Entertainment's debut issue of the series at a May 2, 2012 signing at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan]]\nDue to [[time dilation]], as Aric had been traveling at the [[speed of light]], although only a few years had passed on board, sixteen centuries had passed on Earth. Aric thus found himself in the unfamiliar world of the 20th century. At first, Aric struggled to adjust to late-20th-century Earth. He encountered a number of Valiant Universe heroes, befriending some and alienating others. He eventually gained control of Orb Industries, a multi-national corporation formerly controlled by the [[Spider Aliens]].\n\nX-O Manowar played a major role in Valiant's successful ''Unity'' crossover event. In this storyline, Aric chose not to help the other Valiant heroes defeat [[Mothergod]] (Erica Pierce), and instead built a small empire in the \"lost land.\" Eventually, he was tricked by Mothergod and his people were slaughtered. Aric was eviscerated by a cyborg-[[tyrannosaurus]] and became trapped within the X-O Manowar armor for ten years to heal.\n\nAric and the X-O Manowar armor were sent back to Aric's own time by [[Solar (comics)|Solar]] at the end of ''Unity''. Aric tried to convince his uncle, Alaric, to help him destroy the Romans. However, Alaric was concerned about the power that Aric had gained through the armor. Alaric and the Romans joined forces to fight Aric, but failed to defeat him.\n\nIn issue #28, the X-O Manowar armor (known as Shanhara) was destroyed. Solar went to [[Saturn]] to recover the armor left there, after defeating the alien he battled in ''Solar'' #7. This armor chose to remain with its deceased wearer, but had sprouted a seed, which Solar took. These seeds could be used to create a new Manowar armor, but only through the sacrifice of a sentient being. Aric's friend, Paul Bouvier, who was dying from spider alien poison, consented to be sacrificed so that Aric could continue his battles with the Spider Aliens.\n\nIn the ''X-O Manowar Yearbook'', it was explained how Gilad Anni-Padda, the [[Eternal Warrior]], earned the eternal enmity of Aric. Gilad was rescued from bandits by Aric, but he betrayed the location of Aric's Visigoth Camp to Roman soldiers, whose attack led Deidre to miscarry Aric's child. However, Gilad had betrayed the Visigoths as part of a conspiracy that led to the downfall of the [[Roman Empire]] and the rise of Alaric.\n\n===Acclaim Comics version===\nWhen Acclaim Entertainment acquired the comic series, X-O Manowar was significantly altered. The character was now a modern-day scientist named Donovan Wylie who wielded X-O armor, an ancient artifact owned by the [[United States government]], having been captured from [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]].\n\nIn this series, the X-O Manowar armor is an artifact of unknown origin that has been worn by a myriad of warriors throughout history. It essentially gives its wearer indefinite power; however, the armor slowly siphons the life essence of its wearer, damaging their mind and body. The armor attaches itself to the wearer's nervous system and cannot be removed without killing the person wearing it. It can, however, be changed to its \"metal\" form at the wearer's will, but the metal is permanently grafted onto the wearer's chest (it is unknown if the armor will activate if grafted onto another part of the body.)\n\n==In other media==\n===Film===\nWhile celebrating the 50 issue, Valiant Entertainment CEO Dinesh Shamdasani told Variant that they're hinting a X-O Manowar movie and particularly focusing on the \"directors\".<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owd5Ep75VLE History Of X-O Manowar!]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://superheronews.com/valiant-ceo-teases-mind-blowing-directors-for-o-x-manowar-movie/|title=Valiant CEO teases \"mind blowing\" directors for X-O Manowar movie|publisher=Superhero News|date=September 29, 2016}}</ref>\n{{update|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Video game===\nX-O Manowar was featured along with Marvel Comics' armored superhero [[Iron Man]] in the [[Acclaim Entertainment]]-developed [[video game]] ''[[Iron Man and X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal]]'', produced for [[Personal Computer|PC]], [[PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[Sega Game Gear]], and [[Game Boy]].

Less than a year after it began, with the [[Unity (comics)|Unity]] crossover and quality storytelling bringing attention to Valiant books, back issue prices rose dramatically due to limited early print runs. With comic book speculators buying multiple copies of each issue, sales reached as high as 800,000 copies for ''X-O Manowar'' #0 (August 1993) before dropping off. This original series ran for 68 issues before being canceled after the Sept. 1996 issue, of which only approximately 14,000 were printed.<ref>[http://www.valiantfan.com/valiant/title.asp?tc=x&u=1 X-O MANOWAR COMIC COVER LIBRARY AND DATABASE], ValiantFans.com</ref>\n\nIssues #1\u20134 of the original ''X-O Manowar'' series were reprinted in a trade paperback, ''X-O Manowar: Retribution'', which sold over 150,000 copies. Issues #7 and #8 were reprinted as part of the ''[[Unity (comics)|Unity Saga]]'' trade paperbacks.\n\n===Acclaim Comics era===\nIn 1996, [[Acclaim Entertainment]] bought Valiant for $65 million and restarted the series under the Acclaim Comics banner. The publication of the second series ceased (along with all of Acclaim's non-core business) in 2002 due to Acclaim's financial difficulties in their video game division.\n\n===Valiant Entertainment===\nIn April, 2008, the recently formed Valiant Entertainment released ''X-O Manowar: Birth'', a deluxe hardcover collection collecting the first seven issues of ''X-O Manowar''. The collection was digitally recolored and \"remastered\" from the original material and included a new story, \"The Rise of Lydia,\" by Bob Layton, one the title's original artists. A press release from Valiantfans.com stated:\n\n<blockquote>''X-O Manowar: Birth'' (FEB084088), published by Valiant Entertainment, is solicited in the February Previews (Volume XVIII #2) and scheduled to arrive in comic book stores nationwide on April 30, 2008. This digitally re-colored and re-mastered special edition collects the full X-O Manowar origin story from issues #0\u20136 for the first time ever, and includes an all-new epic \"The Rise of Lydia\" story by comics legend Bob Layton and a new cover by Sean Chen! Aric of Dacia is a Visigoth barbarian captured by spider aliens and enslaved aboard their starship until he steals their ultimate weapon \u2013 the X-O Manowar armor. Aric returns to Earth only to find that 1600 years have past. Now the most primitive man on the planet wields the most technologically advanced weapon in existence! Features explosive art by [[Barry Windsor-Smith]] and Marvel EIC [[Joe Quesada]] and a story by legendary creators [[Bob Layton]] and [[Jim Shooter]]!

Raised under the oppressive thumb of the Roman Empire in fifth century Europe, his entire life was a never-ending series of campaigns against Rome, until a far more terrifying enemy came into play: the brutal race and alien colonizers known as the Vine. Abducted during a midnight scouting raid and taken to the far reaches of space, Aric and his fellow Visigoth captives lived their lives as slaves to the Vine, with no hope of escape.\n\nAfter several years of captivity aboard a Vine colony ship, Aric led a revolt against his alien captors, storming the hallowed temple of the Vine and stealing their most powerful relic, Shanhara, the sentient X-O Manowar armor. Aric bonded with the armor\u2014the first being in living memory to survive the process\u2014and turned the Vine's most powerful weapon against them. But a crushing counterattack by the Vine left many of Aric's allies dead or dying. Inexperienced with the armor himself, Aric barely escaped the Vine fleet before rocketing back to Earth.\n\nUpon his return, Aric learned that due to the effects of time dilation, 1,600 years has passed since his abduction and he was now stranded in the 21st century. Distraught by the loss of his family and people, Aric secluded himself in the Peruvian jungle, but the Vine were unwilling to leave their most sacred relic in human hands. Vine legend told that their greatest champion would one day wear the armor; news of a human controlling the suit could spell massive civil unrest for their empire.\n\nTo recover it, covert Vine agents called \"plantings\" left on Earth hundreds of years ago and modified to appear human, recruited the super spy [[Ninjak]] to kill Aric and return the armor. But with the help of Alexander Dorian, Aric turned Ninjak against his alien masters and led an attack on the Vine's secret headquarters inside Britain's MI-6, virtually eliminating the plantings' operations in England.\n\nThe Vine, however, responded with a full force invasion, one that proved to be no match for the X-O Manowar armor. However, Aric realized that there would be no peace with the Vine until they were destroyed. Commandeering a Vine ship, Aric mounted a one-man invasion of the alien race's home world, Loam, toppling the empire and freeing thousands in the process, including a populations of enslaved Visigoths descended from Aric's own people.\n\nReturning to Earth with his new kinsmen in tow, Aric decided to reestablish an ancestral Visigoth homeland in its present-day location within Romania, a decision which quickly drew the ire of the neighboring Russian government. After warding off a series of coordinated military strikes, Aric was faced with his greatest threat yet, the super-team known as Unity.\n\nAric's defense of Dacia did not go to plan. He was beaten by Toyo Harada, stripped of his armor, and taken into custody by the United States Military Reconnaissance Outpost (M.E.R.O.), a covert government agency that monitors and engages alien threats. In exchange for asylum for him and his people, Aric, now reunited with the X-O Manowar armor, works as an agent of M.E.R.O., protecting American interests on and above the Earth.\n\n===Characters===\n\n====Shanhara (X-O Manowar Armor)====\n\nAccording to legend, the sentient X-O Manowar armor known as Shanhara grew from a secret plant eons ago on the alien empire's home world of Loa. During the Vine's persecution at the hands of a mysterious race known as the Torment, it bonded with its first Vine Host, who went on to use its might to single-handedly repel the invasion force and win freedom for his people. The armor is living, composed of organics and exotic metals\u2014a mutualistic symbiotic, bonded to its host. For centuries, the Vine high priests searched for a wearer that could bear the power of Shanhara, but all such candidates were killed in the process. When Aric of Dacia attempted to escape the Vine Captivity, he bonded with Shanhara as a last resort and was deemed worthy.\n\nAric and Shanhara share a unique relationship\u2014one that continues even when they are separated. Shanhara can translate foreign and alien languages, tap into a world's historical and geographical records, interface with complex forms of technology, and even heal life-threatening injuries and illnesses. Even though the bond between Aric and the armor is strong, it can be severed. Recently, the Harbinger Foundation teletechnopath Livewire was able to override the armor's connection to Aric and wear Shanhara for a limited period. Despite its impact on earthly affairs, the armor's true origin and purpose remain a mystery-one that the beings known as the Armor Hunters will soon expose.\n\n===Original version===\nAric of [[Dacia]] was a [[Visigoth]] born in the 5th century [[AD]] under [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] rule. As a young boy, Aric witnessed the slaughter of his parents at the hands of Roman soldiers. Henceforth, he dedicated himself to destroying the Roman oppressors, with the help of his Uncle, [[Alaric I]].\n\nSome years later, Aric took a [[Celt]]ic [[Slavery|slave]], Deidre, to be his consort. He grew to love her, and worshipped her god, [[Lugh]]. One evening, he saw [[Spider Aliens|demons]] attacking members of his [[tribe]]. Aric attacked them, but was quickly subdued and taken aboard their [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] spacecraft.\n\nFor the next seven years, Aric was held prisoner in the slave pens of the spacecraft. At a refuelling station several [[light year]]s from [[Earth]], he befriended a man known as the \"Map Giver,\" who looked similar to [[Elvis Presley]]. The \"Map Giver\" used a discarded bone shard to carve a map into Aric's palm that would lead him to the alien's armory. Aric fought his way to the X-O Manowar class armor and donned the control ring. It later became clear that the \"manufacturing\" process of the X-O Manowar armor, which not only self-repaired, but also reproduced, involved the absorption of a sentient intelligence that then became the armor's own sentience. With this living armor he was able to escape from the alien ship and return to Earth.\n\n[[File:5.2.12RobertVendittiByLuigiNovi7.jpg|thumb|left|Writer [[Robert Venditti]] signing copies of Valiant Entertainment's debut issue of the series at a May 2, 2012 signing at [[Midtown Comics]] in Manhattan]]\nDue to [[time dilation]], as Aric had been traveling at the [[speed of light]], although only a few years had passed on board, sixteen centuries had passed on Earth. Aric thus found himself in the unfamiliar world of the 20th century. At first, Aric struggled to adjust to late-20th-century Earth. He encountered a number of Valiant Universe heroes, befriending some and alienating others. He eventually gained control of Orb Industries, a multi-national corporation formerly controlled by the [[Spider Aliens]].\n\nX-O Manowar played a major role in Valiant's successful ''Unity'' crossover event. In this storyline, Aric chose not to help the other Valiant heroes defeat [[Mothergod]] (Erica Pierce), and instead built a small empire in the \"lost land.\" Eventually, he was tricked by Mothergod and his people were slaughtered. Aric was eviscerated by a cyborg-[[tyrannosaurus]] and became trapped within the X-O Manowar armor for ten years to heal.\n\nAric and the X-O Manowar armor were sent back to Aric's own time by [[Solar (comics)|Solar]] at the end of ''Unity''. Aric tried to convince his uncle, Alaric, to help him destroy the Romans. However, Alaric was concerned about the power that Aric had gained through the armor. Alaric and the Romans joined forces to fight Aric, but failed to defeat him.\n\nIn issue #28, the X-O Manowar armor (known as Shanhara) was destroyed. Solar went to [[Saturn]] to recover the armor left there, after defeating the alien he battled in ''Solar'' #7. This armor chose to remain with its deceased wearer, but had sprouted a seed, which Solar took. These seeds could be used to create a new Manowar armor, but only through the sacrifice of a sentient being. Aric's friend, Paul Bouvier, who was dying from spider alien poison, consented to be sacrificed so that Aric could continue his battles with the Spider Aliens.\n\nIn the ''X-O Manowar Yearbook'', it was explained how Gilad Anni-Padda, the [[Eternal Warrior]], earned the eternal enmity of Aric. Gilad was rescued from bandits by Aric, but he betrayed the location of Aric's Visigoth Camp to Roman soldiers, whose attack led Deidre to miscarry Aric's child. However, Gilad had betrayed the Visigoths as part of a conspiracy that led to the downfall of the [[Roman Empire]] and the rise of Alaric.\n\n===Acclaim Comics version===\nWhen Acclaim Entertainment acquired the comic series, X-O Manowar was significantly altered. The character was now a modern-day scientist named Donovan Wylie who wielded X-O armor, an ancient artifact owned by the [[United States government]], having been captured from [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]].\n\nIn this series, the X-O Manowar armor is an artifact of unknown origin that has been worn by a myriad of warriors throughout history. It essentially gives its wearer indefinite power; however, the armor slowly siphons the life essence of its wearer, damaging their mind and body. The armor attaches itself to the wearer's nervous system and cannot be removed without killing the person wearing it.

At 3:12, during a McGregor combination, Diaz returned fire with two consecutive hooks, one a slap, a signature of Nate and his brother, [[Nick Diaz]], termed the \"Stockton Slap\". McGregor avoided Diaz's jabs by slipping to his right, often before throwing his left overhand. The second round commenced with Diaz using his check right hook, attempting to keep the aggressive McGregor at distance. Despite this, McGregor had success with his bodywork, landing a left hook to Diaz's right side at 0:37. McGregor began to connect with combinations, until Diaz clinched and pushed McGregor to the fence, at 1:15. After a combination of uppercuts from McGregor at 1:48, Diaz delivered his first significant taunt of the fight, shrugging towards his opponent. At 3:47, McGregor attempted a [[takedown (grappling)#Double leg takedown|double leg takedown]], Diaz successfully [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawling]] to avoid the shot. Diaz, hands clasped around McGregor's neck, threatening the [[guillotine choke]], forced McGregor onto his back after stopping McGregor from scrambling out of the position as he had during the bout with [[Chad Mendes]] at [[UFC 189]]. At 4:00, Diaz secured the [[mount (grappling)|mount]], before firing off a volley of strikes from the top. In an effort to avoid the assault, McGregor gave up his back, allowing Diaz to punch his head into the crook of his arm, and secure a [[rear naked choke]]. McGregor tapped to the submission at 4:12 into the second round, forcing referee [[Herb Dean]] to intervene and stop the bout.<ref name=\"SherdogArticle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/UFC-196-Results-McGregor-vs-Diaz-PlaybyPlay-Updates-101235#conor-mcgregor-nate-diaz|title=UFC 196 Results: 'McGregor vs. Diaz' Play-by-Play & Updates|last1=Breen|first1=Jordan|last2=Critchfield|first2=Tristen|date=5 March 2016|website=Sherdog|last3=Nelson|first3=Chris}}</ref><ref name=\"MetricMvD\">{{cite news|url=http://www.fightmetric.com/fight-details/4ace70bff9debdfb|title=UFC 196: McGregor vs Diaz|publisher=Fight Metric}}</ref><ref name=\"JackSlack\">{{cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/death-of-a-southpaw-how-conor-mcgregor-lost-to-nate-diaz|title=Death of a Southpaw: How Conor McGregor Lost to Nate Diaz|last=Slack|first=Jack|date=7 March 2016|publisher=Fightland}}</ref> Both competitors were awarded \"Fight of the Night\" bonuses, and McGregor received the highest disclosed purse of any fighter in the history of the company, a total of $1,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2016/03/ufc-196-results-nate-diaz-shocks-conor-mcgregor-with-second-round-choke|title=UFC 196 results: Nate Diaz shocks Conor McGregor with second-round choke|publisher=mmajunkie.com|first=Steven|last=Marrocco|date=6 March 2016|accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/blogs/mma/mcgregor-gets-a-record-1m-purse-at-ufc-196/|title=McGregor gets a record $1M purse at UFC 196|work=Sportsnet.ca}}</ref>\n\n=====Rematch with Nate Diaz=====\nA rematch with Diaz was scheduled for 9 July at [[UFC 200]];

At 3:12, during a McGregor combination, Diaz returned fire with two consecutive hooks, one a slap, a signature of Nate and his brother, [[Nick Diaz]], termed the \"Stockton Slap\". McGregor avoided Diaz's jabs by slipping to his right, often before throwing his left overhand. The second round commenced with Diaz using his check right hook, attempting to keep the aggressive McGregor at distance. Despite this, McGregor had success with his bodywork, landing a left hook to Diaz's right side at 0:37. McGregor began to connect with combinations, until Diaz clinched and pushed McGregor to the fence, at 1:15. After a combination of uppercuts from McGregor at 1:48, Diaz delivered his first significant taunt of the fight, shrugging towards his opponent. At 3:47, McGregor attempted a [[takedown (grappling)#Double leg takedown|double leg takedown]], Diaz successfully [[sprawl (grappling)|sprawling]] to avoid the shot. Diaz, hands clasped around McGregor's neck, threatening the [[guillotine choke]], forced McGregor onto his back after stopping McGregor from scrambling out of the position as he had during the bout with [[Chad Mendes]] at [[UFC 189]]. At 4:00, Diaz secured the [[mount (grappling)|mount]], before firing off a volley of strikes from the top. In an effort to avoid the assault, McGregor gave up his back, allowing Diaz to punch his head into the crook of his arm, and secure a [[rear naked choke]]. McGregor tapped to the submission at 4:12 into the second round, forcing referee [[Herb Dean]] to intervene and stop the bout.<ref name=\"SherdogArticle\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/UFC-196-Results-McGregor-vs-Diaz-PlaybyPlay-Updates-101235#conor-mcgregor-nate-diaz|title=UFC 196 Results: 'McGregor vs. Diaz' Play-by-Play & Updates|last1=Breen|first1=Jordan|last2=Critchfield|first2=Tristen|date=5 March 2016|website=Sherdog|last3=Nelson|first3=Chris}}</ref><ref name=\"MetricMvD\">{{cite news|url=http://www.fightmetric.com/fight-details/4ace70bff9debdfb|title=UFC 196: McGregor vs Diaz|publisher=Fight Metric}}</ref><ref name=\"JackSlack\">{{cite news|url=http://fightland.vice.com/blog/death-of-a-southpaw-how-conor-mcgregor-lost-to-nate-diaz|title=Death of a Southpaw: How Conor McGregor Lost to Nate Diaz|last=Slack|first=Jack|date=7 March 2016|publisher=Fightland}}</ref> Both competitors were awarded \"Fight of the Night\" bonuses, and McGregor received the highest disclosed purse of any fighter in the history of the company, a total of $1,000,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2016/03/ufc-196-results-nate-diaz-shocks-conor-mcgregor-with-second-round-choke|title=UFC 196 results: Nate Diaz shocks Conor McGregor with second-round choke|publisher=mmajunkie.com|first=Steven|last=Marrocco|date=6 March 2016|accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/blogs/mma/mcgregor-gets-a-record-1m-purse-at-ufc-196/|title=McGregor gets a record $1M purse at UFC 196|work=Sportsnet.ca}}</ref>\n\n=====Rematch with Nate Diaz=====\nA rematch with Diaz was scheduled for 9 July at [[UFC 200]];

He and his partners staked out {{Convert|4|sqmi|spell=in}} east of [[Denver]], but the town - and Colorado - struggled mightily after the [[Denver Depression of 1893|Silver Crash of 1893]]. At that point Fletcher skipped town, leaving the community with a huge water debt. Inhabitants decided to rename the town Aurora in 1907, after one of the subdivisions composing the town, and Aurora slowly began to grow in Denver's shadow becoming the fastest-growing city in the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Aurora is composed of hundreds of subdivisions thus carries the name of one of the original development plats from which it sprang.\n\nAurora's growing population in recent decades has led to efforts for co-equal recognition with its larger neighbor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Former mayor Dennis Champine once expressed the somewhat whimsical notion that eventually the area would be called the \"Aurora/Denver Metropolitan Area\". Indeed, since the 2000 Census Aurora has surpassed Denver in land area, and much of Aurora is undeveloped, while Denver is more fully built-out. However, such efforts are somewhat hampered by the lack of a large, historically important [[central business district]] in the city. Aurora is largely suburban in character, as evidenced by the city's modest collection of tall buildings.\n\nA large military presence has existed in Aurora since the early 20th century. In 1918, Army General Hospital #21 (later renamed [[Fitzsimons Army Hospital]]) opened, with the U.S. government expanding and upgrading the hospital facilities in 1941 just in time to care for the wounded servicemen of World War II. [[Lowry Air Force Base]] was opened in 1938, straddling the border of Aurora and Denver. It eventually closed in 1994, and has been redeveloped into a master-planned community featuring residential, commercial, business and educational facilities.  In 1942, the Army Air Corps built Buckley Field, which has been renamed Naval Air Station, Buckley Air National Guard Base and finally [[Buckley Air Force Base]]. The base, home of the [[460th Space Wing]] and the [[140th Wing]] Colorado Air National Guard, is Aurora's largest employer.\n\nPresident [[Warren G. Harding]] visited Fitzsimons Army Hospital in 1923, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] visited in 1936.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/print-edition/2016/03/25/ttimeline-development-of-the-anschutz-campus.html#g6|title=Timeline: Development of the Anschutz campus (Slideshow) - Denver Business Journal|website=Denver Business Journal|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> In 1943 the hospital was the birthplace of 2004 Democratic presidential candidate [[John Kerry]].

Decommissioned in 1999, the facility is part of the [[Anschutz Medical Campus]] of the [[University of Colorado Denver]], and the [[Fitzsimons Life Science District]]. The Anschutz Medical Campus also includes the [[University of Colorado Hospital]], which moved to Aurora from Denver in 2007, and the [[Children's Hospital (Aurora, Colorado)|Children's Hospital]].

However, due to legal problems the project was never completed. The script of the unmade film project, renamed ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'', was used as cover for the \"Canadian Caper\": the exfiltration of six U.S. diplomatic staff trapped by the [[Iranian hostage crisis]].\n\nIn 1993, [[Cherry Creek State Park]] on the southwestern edge of Aurora was the location for the papal mass of the 8th [[World Youth Day]] with [[Pope John Paul II]], attended by an estimated 500,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/4865 |title=World Youth Day memorial signs in need of repair |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065853/http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/4865 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Aurora was honored as the ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's 50th Anniversary \"Sportstown\" for Colorado because of its exemplary involvement in facilitating and enhancing sports.

He and his partners staked out {{Convert|4|sqmi|spell=in}} east of [[Denver]], but the town - and Colorado - struggled mightily after the [[Denver Depression of 1893|Silver Crash of 1893]]. At that point Fletcher skipped town, leaving the community with a huge water debt. Inhabitants decided to rename the town Aurora in 1907, after one of the subdivisions composing the town, and Aurora slowly began to grow in Denver's shadow becoming the fastest-growing city in the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Aurora is composed of hundreds of subdivisions thus carries the name of one of the original development plats from which it sprang.\n\nAurora's growing population in recent decades has led to efforts for co-equal recognition with its larger neighbor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Former mayor Dennis Champine once expressed the somewhat whimsical notion that eventually the area would be called the \"Aurora/Denver Metropolitan Area\". Indeed, since the 2000 Census Aurora has surpassed Denver in land area, and much of Aurora is undeveloped, while Denver is more fully built-out. However, such efforts are somewhat hampered by the lack of a large, historically important [[central business district]] in the city. Aurora is largely suburban in character, as evidenced by the city's modest collection of tall buildings.\n\nA large military presence has existed in Aurora since the early 20th century. In 1918, Army General Hospital #21 (later renamed [[Fitzsimons Army Hospital]]) opened, with the U.S. government expanding and upgrading the hospital facilities in 1941 just in time to care for the wounded servicemen of World War II. [[Lowry Air Force Base]] was opened in 1938, straddling the border of Aurora and Denver. It eventually closed in 1994, and has been redeveloped into a master-planned community featuring residential, commercial, business and educational facilities.  In 1942, the Army Air Corps built Buckley Field, which has been renamed Naval Air Station, Buckley Air National Guard Base and finally [[Buckley Air Force Base]]. The base, home of the [[460th Space Wing]] and the [[140th Wing]] Colorado Air National Guard, is Aurora's largest employer.\n\nPresident [[Warren G. Harding]] visited Fitzsimons Army Hospital in 1923, and President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] visited in 1936.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/print-edition/2016/03/25/ttimeline-development-of-the-anschutz-campus.html#g6|title=Timeline: Development of the Anschutz campus (Slideshow) - Denver Business Journal|website=Denver Business Journal|access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> In 1943 the hospital was the birthplace of 2004 Democratic presidential candidate [[John Kerry]]. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] recovered from a heart attack at Fitzsimons for seven weeks during the fall of 1955. Decommissioned in 1999, the facility is part of the [[Anschutz Medical Campus]] of the [[University of Colorado Denver]], and the [[Fitzsimons Life Science District]]. The Anschutz Medical Campus also includes the [[University of Colorado Hospital]], which moved to Aurora from Denver in 2007, and the [[Children's Hospital (Aurora, Colorado)|Children's Hospital]].

Walker]] became the [[List of first female mayors|first woman]] to head a U.S. city with a population over 60,000.\n\nIn 1979, it was announced that a science fiction theme park would be built in Aurora using the sets of a 50,000,000 dollar film based on the fantasy novel [[Lord of Light]]. However, due to legal problems the project was never completed. The script of the unmade film project, renamed ''[[Argo (2012 film)|Argo]]'', was used as cover for the \"Canadian Caper\": the exfiltration of six U.S. diplomatic staff trapped by the [[Iranian hostage crisis]].\n\nIn 1993, [[Cherry Creek State Park]] on the southwestern edge of Aurora was the location for the papal mass of the 8th [[World Youth Day]] with [[Pope John Paul II]], attended by an estimated 500,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/4865 |title=World Youth Day memorial signs in need of repair |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927065853/http://www.archden.org/index.cfm/ID/4865 |archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, Aurora was honored as the ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's 50th Anniversary \"Sportstown\" for Colorado because of its exemplary involvement in facilitating and enhancing sports. The city attracts more than 30 regional and national sports tournaments annually to Aurora's fields, which include the {{convert|220|acre|km2|adj=on}} Aurora Sports Park opened in 2003. Aurora's active populace is also reflected in the variety of professional athletes [[#Notables|hailing from the city]].

The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle there, starting in the early 17th century, when they founded the colonies of [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] and [[Berbice]], adding [[Demerara]] in the mid-18th century. In 1796, Great Britain took over these three colonies during hostilities with the French, who had occupied the [[Netherlands]]. Britain returned control to the [[Batavian Republic]] in 1802 but captured the colonies a year later during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The colonies were officially ceded to the United Kingdom in 1814 and consolidated into a single colony in 1831. The colony's capital was at [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] (known as Stabroek prior to 1812).\n\nAs the British developed the colony for [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantations]], they imported many [[Africans]] as [[slave]] labour.{{Citation needed|reason=Apparent contradiction in dates for this statement; see Talk page.|date=August 2017}} The economy has become more diversified since the late 19th century but has relied on resource exploitation. Guyana became independent of the United Kingdom on 26 May 1966.\n\n==Establishment==\nThe English made at least two unsuccessful attempts in the 17th century to colonise the lands that would later be known as British Guiana, at which time the Dutch had established two colonies in the area: [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]], administered by the [[Dutch West India Company]], and [[Berbice]], administered by the [[Berbice Association]]. The Dutch West India Company founded a third colony, [[Demerara]], in the mid-18th century. During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] of the late 18th century, when the Netherlands were occupied by the French, and Great Britain and France were at war, Britain took over the colony in 1796. A British expeditionary force was dispatched from its colony of [[Barbados]] to seize the colonies from the French-dominated [[Batavian Republic]].  The colonies surrendered without a struggle. Initially very little changed, as the British agreed to allow the long-established laws of the colonies to remain in force.\n\nIn 1802 Britain returned the colonies to the Batavian Republic under the terms of the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. But, after resuming hostilities with France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803, Britain seized the colonies again less than a year later. The three colonies were officially ceded to the United Kingdom in the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].  The UK continued separate administration of the individual colonies until 1822 when the administration of Essequibo and Demerara was combined. In 1831, the administration Essequibo-Demerara and Berbice was combined, and the united colony became known as British Guiana.\n\n==Economy and politics==\nThe economy of British Guiana was completely based on sugarcane production until the 1880s, when falling cane sugar prices stimulated a shift toward rice farming, mining and forestry. However, sugarcane remained a significant part of the economy (in 1959 sugar still accounted for nearly 50% of exports). Under the Dutch, settlement and economic activity was concentrated around sugarcane plantations lying inland from the coast.  Under the British, cane planting expanded to richer coastal lands, with greater coastline protection. Until the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolition of slavery in the British Empire]], sugar planters depended almost exclusively on slave labour to produce sugar. Georgetown was the site of [[Demerara rebellion of 1823|a significant slave rebellion in 1823]].\n[[File:Plate 6 Provisional Battalion.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Demerara rebellion of 1823]]\n\nIn the 1880s gold and diamond deposits were discovered in British Guiana, but they did not produce significant revenue.  [[Bauxite]] deposits proved more promising and would remain an important part of the economy. The colony did not develop any significant manufacturing industry, other than sugar factories, rice mills, [[sawmill]]s, and certain small-scale industries (including a brewery, a soap factory, a biscuit factory and an oxygen-acetylene plant, among others).\n\nThe London-based [[Booker Group]] of companies (Booker Brothers, McConnell & Co., Ltd) dominated the economy of British Guiana. The Bookers had owned sugar plantations in the colony since the early 19th century; by the end of the century they owned a majority of them; and by 1950 owned all but three.  With the increasing success and wealth of the Booker Group, they expanded internationally and diversified by investing in rum, pharmaceuticals, publishing, advertising, retail stores, timber, and petroleum, among other industries. The Booker Group became the largest employer in the colony, leading some to refer to it as \"Booker's Guiana\".\n\n==Railways==\nBritish colonists built the first railway system in British Guiana: {{convert|61|mi|km|order=flip}} of {{Track gauge|standard|allk=on}}, from Georgetown to Rosignol, and {{convert|19|mi|km|order=flip}} of {{Track gauge|3 ft 6 in|first=met}} line between Vreeden Hoop and Parika; it opened in 1848. Several [[narrow-gauge]] lines were built to serve the sugar industry and others were built to serve the later mines.\n\nIn 1948, when the [[Bermuda Railway|railway in Bermuda]] was closed down, the locomotives, rolling stock, track, sleepers and virtually all the associated paraphernalia of a railway were shipped to British Guiana to renovate the aged system.\n\nThe lines ceased to operate in 1972, but the large Central Station is still standing in Georgetown. Some of the inland mines still operate narrow-gauge lines.\n\n==Administration==\n{{see also|List of Governors of British Guiana}}\n\nThe British long continued the forms of Dutch colonial government in British Guiana. A Court of Policy exercised both [[Legislature|legislative]] and executive functions under the direction of the [[List of Governors of British Guiana|colonial Governor]] (which existed from 1831 to 1966). A group known as the Financial Representatives sat with the Court of Policy in a Combined Court to set tax policies.  A majority of the members of the Courts was appointed by the Governor; the rest were selected by a [[College of Kiezers]] (Electors). The Kiezers were elected, with the restrictive [[Suffrage|franchise]] based on property holdings and limited to the larger landowners of the colony. The Courts were dominated in the early centuries by the sugar planters and their representatives.\n\nIn 1891 the College of Kiezers was abolished in favour of direct election of the elective membership of the Courts. Membership of the Court of Policy became half elected and half appointed, and all of the Financial Representatives became elective positions. The executive functions of the Court of Policy were transferred to a new Executive Council under the control of the Governor. Property qualifications were significantly relaxed for voters and for candidates to the Courts.\n\nIn 1928 the [[British Government]] abolished the Dutch-influenced constitution and replaced it with a [[Crown colony]] constitution. A Legislative Council with an appointed majority was established, and the administrative powers of the Governor were strengthened. These constitutional changes were not popular among the Guyanese, who viewed them as a step backward. The franchise was [[Women's rights#Right to vote|extended to women]].\n\nIn 1938 the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|West India Royal Commission]] (\"The Moyne Commission\") was appointed to investigate the economic and social condition of all the British colonies in the [[Caribbean]] region after a number of [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|civil and labour disturbances]]. Among other changes, the Commission recommended some constitutional reforms. As a result, in 1943 a majority of the Legislative Council seats became elective, the property qualifications for voters and for candidates for the Council were lowered, and the bar on women and clergy serving on the Council was abolished. The Governor retained control of the Executive Council, which had the power to veto or pass laws against the wishes of the Legislative Council.\n\nThe next round of constitutional reforms came in 1953. A [[Bicameralism|bicameral\nlegislature]], consisting of a lower [[House of Assembly (British Guiana)|House of Assembly]] and an upper State Council, was established. The voting membership of the House of Assembly was entirely elective. The membership of the State Council was appointed by the Governor and the House of Assembly and possessed limited revisionary powers.  A Court of Policy became the executive body, consisting of the Governor and other colonial officials. Universal adult suffrage was instituted, and the property qualifications for office abolished.\n\nThe [[1953 British Guiana general election|election of 27 April 1953]] under the new system provoked a serious constitutional crisis. The [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) won 18 of the 24 seats in the House of Assembly. This result alarmed the British Government, which was surprised by the strong showing of the PPP. It considered the PPP as too friendly with communist organisations.\n\nAs a result of its fears of communist influence in the colony, the British Government suspended the constitution, declared a [[state of emergency]], and militarily occupied British Guiana on 9 October 1953. Under the direction of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|British Colonial Office]], the Governor assumed direct rule of the colony under an Interim Government, which continued until 1957. On 12 August 1957, [[1957 British Guiana general election|elections]] were held and the PPP won nine of fourteen elective seats in a new legislature.\n\nA constitutional convention convened in London in March 1960 reached agreement on another new legislature, to consist of an elected House of Assembly (35 seats) and a nominated Senate (13 seats). In the ensuing election of 21 August 1961, the PPP won 20 seats in the House of Assembly, entitling it as the majority party to appoint eight senators. Upon the 1961 election, British Guiana also became [[Self-governance|self-governing]], except as to defence and external matters. The leader of the majority party became Prime Minister, who then named a Council of Ministers, replacing the former Executive Council.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1964, riots, strikes and other disturbances stemming from racial, social and economic conflicts delayed full independence for British Guiana. The leaders of the political parties reported to the British Colonial Secretary that they were unable to reach agreement on the remaining details of forming an independent government. The British Colonial Office intervened by imposing its own independence plan, in part requiring another election under a new [[proportional representation]] system. Britain expected that this system would reduce the number of seats won by the PPP and prevent it from obtaining a majority.\n\nThe December 1964 elections for the new legislature gave the PPP 45.8% (24 seats), the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] (PNC) 40.5% (22 seats) and the United Force (UF) 12.4% (7 seats). The UF agreed to form a [[coalition government]] with the PNC, and accordingly, the PNC leader became the new Prime Minister. In November 1965 an independence conference in London quickly reached agreement on an independent constitution; it set the date for independence as 26 May 1966. On that date, at 12 midnight, British Guiana became the new nation of [[Guyana]].\n\n==Territorial disputes==\n[[File:Boundary lines of British Guiana 1896.jpg|thumb|British Guiana and its boundary lines, 1896]]\n\n=== Western boundary with Venezuela ===\n{{main|Guayana Esequiba}}\nIn 1840, the British Government assigned [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk]] to survey and mark out the western boundary of British Guiana with newly independent [[Venezuela]]. Venezuela did not accept the [[Schomburgk Line]], which placed the entire [[Cuyuni River]] basin within the colony. Venezuela claimed all lands west of the [[Essequibo River]] as its territory (see map in this section).\n\nThe dispute continued on and off for half a century, culminating in the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895]], in which Venezuela sought to use the United States' [[Monroe Doctrine]] to win support for its position. US President [[Grover Cleveland]] used diplomatic pressure to get the British to agree to arbitration of the issue, ultimately agreeing terms for the arbitration that suited Britain. An [[arbitral tribunal|arbitration tribunal]] convened in Paris in 1898, and issued its [[arbitration award|award]] in 1899. The tribunal awarded about 94% of the disputed territory to British Guiana. A commission surveyed a new border according to the award, and the parties accepted the boundary in 1905.\n\nThere the matter rested until 1962, when Venezuela renewed its 19th-century claim, alleging that the arbitral award was invalid. After his death, Severo Mallet-Prevost, legal counsel for Venezuela and a named partner in the New York law firm [[Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle]] published a letter alleging that the judges on the tribunal acted improperly as a result of a back-room deal between Russia and Great Britain. The British Government rejected this claim, asserting the validity of the 1899 award. The British Guiana Government, then under the leadership of the PPP, also strongly rejected this claim. Efforts by all parties to resolve the matter on the eve of Guyana's independence in 1966 failed; as of today, the dispute remains unresolved.\n\n===Eastern boundary with Suriname===\n{{see also|Borders of Suriname}}\nRobert Schomburgk's 1840 commission also included a survey of the colony's eastern boundary with the [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch colony of Surinam]], now the [[Suriname|independent nation of Suriname]]. The 1899 arbitration award settling the British Guiana\u2014Venezuela border made reference to the border with Suriname as continuing to the source of the [[Courantyne River]], which it named as the [[Kutari River]].  The Netherlands raised a diplomatic protest, claiming that the [[New River (South America)|New River]], and not the Kutari, was to be regarded as the source of the Courantyne and the boundary.

The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle there, starting in the early 17th century, when they founded the colonies of [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] and [[Berbice]], adding [[Demerara]] in the mid-18th century. In 1796, Great Britain took over these three colonies during hostilities with the French, who had occupied the [[Netherlands]]. Britain returned control to the [[Batavian Republic]] in 1802 but captured the colonies a year later during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The colonies were officially ceded to the United Kingdom in 1814 and consolidated into a single colony in 1831. The colony's capital was at [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] (known as Stabroek prior to 1812).\n\nAs the British developed the colony for [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantations]], they imported many [[Africans]] as [[slave]] labour.{{Citation needed|reason=Apparent contradiction in dates for this statement; see Talk page.|date=August 2017}} The economy has become more diversified since the late 19th century but has relied on resource exploitation. Guyana became independent of the United Kingdom on 26 May 1966.\n\n==Establishment==\nThe English made at least two unsuccessful attempts in the 17th century to colonise the lands that would later be known as British Guiana, at which time the Dutch had established two colonies in the area: [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]], administered by the [[Dutch West India Company]], and [[Berbice]], administered by the [[Berbice Association]]. The Dutch West India Company founded a third colony, [[Demerara]], in the mid-18th century. During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] of the late 18th century, when the Netherlands were occupied by the French, and Great Britain and France were at war, Britain took over the colony in 1796. A British expeditionary force was dispatched from its colony of [[Barbados]] to seize the colonies from the French-dominated [[Batavian Republic]].  The colonies surrendered without a struggle. Initially very little changed, as the British agreed to allow the long-established laws of the colonies to remain in force.\n\nIn 1802 Britain returned the colonies to the Batavian Republic under the terms of the [[Treaty of Amiens]]. But, after resuming hostilities with France in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803, Britain seized the colonies again less than a year later. The three colonies were officially ceded to the United Kingdom in the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].  The UK continued separate administration of the individual colonies until 1822 when the administration of Essequibo and Demerara was combined. In 1831, the administration Essequibo-Demerara and Berbice was combined, and the united colony became known as British Guiana.\n\n==Economy and politics= =\nThe economy of British Guiana was completely based on sugarcane production until the 1880s, when falling cane sugar prices stimulated a shift toward rice farming, mining and forestry. However, sugarcane remained a significant part of the economy (in 1959 sugar still accounted for nearly 50% of exports). Under the Dutch, settlement and economic activity was concentrated around sugarcane plantations lying inland from the coast.  Under the British, cane planting expanded to richer coastal lands, with greater coastline protection. Until the [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolition of slavery in the British Empire]], sugar planters depended almost exclusively on slave labour to produce sugar. Georgetown was the site of [[Demerara rebellion of 1823|a significant slave rebellion in 1823]].\n[[File:Plate 6 Provisional Battalion.jpg|thumb|Illustration of the Demerara rebellion of 1823]]\n\nIn the 1880s gold and diamond deposits were discovered in British Guiana, but they did not produce significant revenue.  [[Bauxite]] deposits proved more promising and would remain an important part of the economy. The colony did not develop any significant manufacturing industry, other than sugar factories, rice mills, [[sawmill]]s, and certain small-scale industries (including a brewery, a soap factory, a biscuit factory and an oxygen-acetylene plant, among others).\n\nThe London-based [[Booker Group]] of companies (Booker Brothers, McConnell & Co., Ltd) dominated the economy of British Guiana. The Bookers had owned sugar plantations in the colony since the early 19th century; by the end of the century they owned a majority of them; and by 1950 owned all but three.  With the increasing success and wealth of the Booker Group, they expanded internationally and diversified by investing in rum, pharmaceuticals, publishing, advertising, retail stores, timber, and petroleum, among other industries. The Booker Group became the largest employer in the colony, leading some to refer to it as \"Booker's Guiana\".\n\n==Railways==\nBritish colonists built the first railway system in British Guiana: {{convert|61|mi|km|order=flip}} of {{Track gauge|standard|allk=on}}, from Georgetown to Rosignol, and {{convert|19|mi|km|order=flip}} of {{Track gauge|3 ft 6 in|first=met}} line between Vreeden Hoop and Parika; it opened in 1848. Several [[narrow-gauge]] lines were built to serve the sugar industry and others were built to serve the later mines.\n\nIn 1948, when the [[Bermuda Railway|railway in Bermuda]] was closed down, the locomotives, rolling stock, track, sleepers and virtually all the associated paraphernalia of a railway were shipped to British Guiana to renovate the aged system.\n\nThe lines ceased to operate in 1972, but the large Central Station is still standing in Georgetown. Some of the inland mines still operate narrow-gauge lines.\n\n==Administration==\n{{see also|List of Governors of British Guiana}}\n\nThe British long continued the forms of Dutch colonial government in British Guiana. A Court of Policy exercised both [[Legislature|legislative]] and executive functions under the direction of the [[List of Governors of British Guiana|colonial Governor]] (which existed from 1831 to 1966). A group known as the Financial Representatives sat with the Court of Policy in a Combined Court to set tax policies.  A majority of the members of the Courts was appointed by the Governor; the rest were selected by a [[College of Kiezers]] (Electors). The Kiezers were elected, with the restrictive [[Suffrage|franchise]] based on property holdings and limited to the larger landowners of the colony. The Courts were dominated in the early centuries by the sugar planters and their representatives.\n\nIn 1891 the College of Kiezers was abolished in favour of direct election of the elective membership of the Courts. Membership of the Court of Policy became half elected and half appointed, and all of the Financial Representatives became elective positions. The executive functions of the Court of Policy were transferred to a new Executive Council under the control of the Governor. Property qualifications were significantly relaxed for voters and for candidates to the Courts.\n\nIn 1928 the [[British Government]] abolished the Dutch-influenced constitution and replaced it with a [[Crown colony]] constitution. A Legislative Council with an appointed majority was established, and the administrative powers of the Governor were strengthened. These constitutional changes were not popular among the Guyanese, who viewed them as a step backward. The franchise was [[Women's rights#Right to vote|extended to women]].\n\nIn 1938 the [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|West India Royal Commission]] (\"The Moyne Commission\") was appointed to investigate the economic and social condition of all the British colonies in the [[Caribbean]] region after a number of [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939|civil and labour disturbances]]. Among other changes, the Commission recommended some constitutional reforms. As a result, in 1943 a majority of the Legislative Council seats became elective, the property qualifications for voters and for candidates for the Council were lowered, and the bar on women and clergy serving on the Council was abolished. The Governor retained control of the Executive Council, which had the power to veto or pass laws against the wishes of the Legislative Council.\n\nThe next round of constitutional reforms came in 1953. A [[Bicameralism|bicameral\nlegislature]], consisting of a lower [[House of Assembly (British Guiana)|House of Assembly]] and an upper State Council, was established. The voting membership of the House of Assembly was entirely elective. The membership of the State Council was appointed by the Governor and the House of Assembly and possessed limited revisionary powers.  A Court of Policy became the executive body, consisting of the Governor and other colonial officials. Universal adult suffrage was instituted, and the property qualifications for office abolished.\n\nThe [[1953 British Guiana general election|election of 27 April 1953]] under the new system provoked a serious constitutional crisis. The [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP) won 18 of the 24 seats in the House of Assembly. This result alarmed the British Government, which was surprised by the strong showing of the PPP. It considered the PPP as too friendly with communist organisations.\n\nAs a result of its fears of communist influence in the colony, the British Government suspended the constitution, declared a [[state of emergency]], and militarily occupied British Guiana on 9 October 1953. Under the direction of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|British Colonial Office]], the Governor assumed direct rule of the colony under an Interim Government, which continued until 1957. On 12 August 1957, [[1957 British Guiana general election|elections]] were held and the PPP won nine of fourteen elective seats in a new legislature.\n\nA constitutional convention convened in London in March 1960 reached agreement on another new legislature, to consist of an elected House of Assembly (35 seats) and a nominated Senate (13 seats). In the ensuing election of 21 August 1961, the PPP won 20 seats in the House of Assembly, entitling it as the majority party to appoint eight senators. Upon the 1961 election, British Guiana also became [[Self-governance|self-governing]], except as to defence and external matters. The leader of the majority party became Prime Minister, who then named a Council of Ministers, replacing the former Executive Council.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1964, riots, strikes and other disturbances stemming from racial, social and economic conflicts delayed full independence for British Guiana. The leaders of the political parties reported to the British Colonial Secretary that they were unable to reach agreement on the remaining details of forming an independent government. The British Colonial Office intervened by imposing its own independence plan, in part requiring another election under a new [[proportional representation]] system. Britain expected that this system would reduce the number of seats won by the PPP and prevent it from obtaining a majority.\n\nThe December 1964 elections for the new legislature gave the PPP 45.8% (24 seats), the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]] (PNC) 40.5% (22 seats) and the United Force (UF) 12.4% (7 seats). The UF agreed to form a [[coalition government]] with the PNC, and accordingly, the PNC leader became the new Prime Minister. In November 1965 an independence conference in London quickly reached agreement on an independent constitution; it set the date for independence as 26 May 1966. On that date, at 12 midnight, British Guiana became the new nation of [[Guyana]].\n\n==Territorial disputes==\n[[File:Boundary lines of British Guiana 1896.jpg|thumb|British Guiana and its boundary lines, 1896]]\n\n=== Western boundary with Venezuela ===\n{{main|Guayana Esequiba}}\nIn 1840, the British Government assigned [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk]] to survey and mark out the western boundary of British Guiana with newly independent [[Venezuela]]. Venezuela did not accept the [[Schomburgk Line]], which placed the entire [[Cuyuni River]] basin within the colony. Venezuela claimed all lands west of the [[Essequibo River]] as its territory (see map in this section).\n\nThe dispute continued on and off for half a century, culminating in the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895]], in which Venezuela sought to use the United States' [[Monroe Doctrine]] to win support for its position. US President [[Grover Cleveland]] used diplomatic pressure to get the British to agree to arbitration of the issue, ultimately agreeing terms for the arbitration that suited Britain. An [[arbitral tribunal|arbitration tribunal]] convened in Paris in 1898, and issued its [[arbitration award|award]] in 1899. The tribunal awarded about 94% of the disputed territory to British Guiana. A commission surveyed a new border according to the award, and the parties accepted the boundary in 1905.\n\nThere the matter rested until 1962, when Venezuela renewed its 19th-century claim, alleging that the arbitral award was invalid. After his death, Severo Mallet-Prevost, legal counsel for Venezuela and a named partner in the New York law firm [[Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle]] published a letter alleging that the judges on the tribunal acted improperly as a result of a back-room deal between Russia and Great Britain. The British Government rejected this claim, asserting the validity of the 1899 award. The British Guiana Government, then under the leadership of the PPP, also strongly rejected this claim. Efforts by all parties to resolve the matter on the eve of Guyana's independence in 1966 failed; as of today, the dispute remains unresolved.\n\n===Eastern boundary with Suriname===\n{{see also|Borders of Suriname}}\nRobert Schomburgk's 1840 commission also included a survey of the colony's eastern boundary with the [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch colony of Surinam]], now the [[Suriname|independent nation of Suriname]]. The 1899 arbitration award settling the British Guiana\u2014Venezuela border made reference to the border with Suriname as continuing to the source of the [[Courantyne River]], which it named as the [[Kutari River]].  The Netherlands raised a diplomatic protest, claiming that the [[New River (South America)|New River]], and not the Kutari, was to be regarded as the source of the Courantyne and the boundary.  The British government in 1900 replied that the issue was already settled by the longstanding acceptance of the Kutari as the boundary.\n\nIn 1962, the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], on behalf of its then-[[Suriname (Kingdom of the Netherlands)|constituent country of Suriname]], finally made formal claim to the \"[[New River Triangle]]\", the triangular-shaped region between the New and Kutari rivers that was in dispute.  The then Surinamese colonial government and, after 1975, the independent Surinamese government, maintained the Dutch position, while the British Guiana Government, and later the independent Guyanese government, maintained the British position.\n\n==Stamps and postal history of British Guiana==\n{{Main|Postage stamps and postal history of British Guiana}}\n[[File:British Guiana 1938 Victoria Regia.jpg|thumb|190px|Stamp with a portrait of King [[George VI]], 1938]]\n\nBritish Guiana is famous among [[philately|philatelists]] for its early postage stamps, which were first issued in 1850.
