The Spanish and British took up the exploration of the northwest coast, beginning with the visits of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez|Juan P\u00e9rez]] in 1774, and of [[James Cook]] in 1778. Although the Victoria area of the Strait of Juan de Fuca was not explored until 1790, Spanish sailors visited [[Esquimalt Harbour]] (just west of Victoria proper) in 1790, 1791, and 1792.\n\nIn 1841 [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, upon the recommendation by [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]] a new more northerly post be built in case [[Fort Vancouver]] fell into American hands (see [[Oregon boundary dispute]]). Douglas founded [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] on the site of present-day Victoria in anticipation of the outcome of the [[Oregon Treaty]] in 1846, extending the [[British North America]]/United States border along the 49th parallel from the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] to the [[Georgia Strait|Strait of Georgia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:(1862) VICTORIA FROM JAMES' BAY LOOKING UP GOVERNMENT STREET.jpg|thumb|left|View of Victoria from [[James Bay, Greater Victoria|James Bay]] in 1862.

[[Robert Dunsmuir]], a leading industrialist whose interests included coal mines and a railway on Vancouver Island, constructed [[Craigdarroch Castle]] in the [[Rockland, Greater Victoria|Rockland]] area, near the [[Government House (British Columbia)|official residence]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|province's Lieutenant Governor]]. His son [[James Dunsmuir]] became [[Premier of British Columbia|Premier]] and subsequently Lieutenant Governor of the province and built his own grand residence at [[Hatley Park]] (used for several decades as [[Royal Roads Military College]], now civilian [[Royal Roads University]]) in the present City of [[Colwood, British Columbia|Colwood]].\n[[File:Personnel of the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve outside the British Columbia Legislature.jpg|thumb|left|[[Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve]] members stand outside the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings]] in 1914.]]\nA real-estate and development boom ended just before [[World War I]], leaving Victoria with a large stock of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] public, commercial and residential buildings that have greatly contributed to the city's character. With the economic crash and a surplus of single men, Victoria became a target-rich environment for recruiting. Two militia infantry battalions, the 88th Victoria Fusiliers and the 50th Gordon Highlanders, formed in the immediate pre-war period. Victoria was the home of [[Sir Arthur Currie]].

[[Pleistocene glaciation]] put the area under a thick ice cover, the weight of which depressed the land below present sea level. These glaciers also deposited stony sandy loam [[glacial till|till]]. As they retreated, their melt water left thick deposits of sand and [[gravel]]. Marine [[clay]] settled on what would later become dry land. Post-glacial rebound exposed the present-day terrain to air, raising beach and mud deposits well above sea level. The resulting soils are highly variable in texture, and abrupt textural changes are common. In general, clays are most likely to be encountered in the northern part of town and in depressions. The southern part has coarse-textured subsoils and loamy topsoils. Sandy loams and loamy sands are common in the eastern part adjoining Oak Bay. Victoria's soils are relatively unleached and less acidic than soils elsewhere on the [[British Columbia Coast]]. Their thick dark topsoils denoted a high level of fertility which made them valuable for farming until urbanization.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Victoria (Gonzales Marine)\n|  3.0 |  7.0 |  94.3\n|  3.7 |  8.6 |  71.7\n|  4.5 | 10.6 |  46.5\n|  6.0 | 13.1 |  28.5\n|  8.2 | 15.9 |  25.8\n| 10.0 | 17.9 |  20.7\n| 11.3 | 19.8 |  14.0\n| 11.7 | 20.1 |  19.7\n| 10.7 | 18.5 |  27.4\n|  7.9 | 13.8 |  51.2\n|  5.0 |  9.4 |  98.9\n|  3.2 |  7.1 | 108.9\n| float = right\n| clear = both\n| source = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"CCN\">{{cite web | url = http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 | title = Victoria Gonzales HTS, British Columbia | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000 | publisher = Environment Canada | language = English, French | accessdate = 15 February 2013 | date = 2011-01-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130517080751/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 | archive-date = 17 May 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref>}}\n\nVictoria has a [[Warm-summer Mediterrean climate|warm summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csb'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 March 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/62twqml5g?url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |archive-date=2 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> with fresh, dry summers and cool winters with frequent rainfall.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last         = Kottek\n |first        = M.\n |author2      = J.

The city has a distinct dry and rainy season, with two-thirds of its annual rainfall coming from November to February.]]\nOne feature of Victoria's climate is its distinct dry and rainy seasons. Nearly two-thirds of the annual precipitation falls during the four wettest months, November to February. Precipitation in December, the wettest month ({{convert|109|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is nearly eight times as high as in July, the driest month ({{convert|14|mm|1|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Victoria experiences the driest summers in Canada (outside of the extreme northern reaches of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut).<ref>[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html Climate Normals & Averages | Canada's National Climate Archive] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627223111/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/index_e.html |date=27 June 2013 }}.

Roughly one third of winters see virtually no snow, with less than {{convert|5|cm|1|abbr=on}} falling during the entire season. When snow does fall, it rarely lasts long on the ground. Victoria averages just two or three days per year with at least {{convert|5|cm|1|abbr=on}} of snow on the ground. Every few decades Victoria receives very large snowfalls including the record breaking {{convert|100|cm|1|abbr=on}} of snow that fell in December 1996. That amount places Victoria 3rd for biggest snowfall among major cities in Canada.\n\nWith 2,193 hours of bright sunshine annually during the last available measurement period, Victoria was the second sunniest city in British Columbia after [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]]. In July 2013, Victoria received 432.8 hours of bright sunshine, which is the most sunshine ever recorded in any month in British Columbia history.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=5BA5EAFC-1&offset=12&toc=show#ru1 |title= Canada's Top Ten Weather Stories for 2013: Runner up Stories |publisher= Environment Canada |accessdate= 27 August 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151204023113/http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=5BA5EAFC-1&offset=12&toc=show#ru1 |archive-date= 4 December 2015 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\nVictoria's equable climate has also added to its reputation as the \"City of Gardens\". The city takes pride in the many flowers that bloom during the winter and early spring, including crocuses, daffodils, early-blooming rhododendrons, cherry and plum trees. Every February there is an annual \"flower count\" in what for the rest of the country and most of the province is still the dead of winter.\n\nDue to its mild climate, Victoria and its surrounding area (southeastern Vancouver Island, [[Gulf Islands]], and parts of the [[Lower Mainland]] and [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia|Sunshine Coast]]) are also home to many rare, native plants found nowhere else in Canada, including ''[[Quercus garryana]]'' (Garry oak), ''[[Arctostaphylos columbiana]]'' (hairy manzanita), and Canada's only broad-leaf evergreen tree, ''[[Arbutus menziesii]]'' (Pacific madrone). Many of these species exist here, at the northern end of their range, and are found as far south as southern California and parts of Mexico.\n\nNon-native plants grown in Victoria include the cold-hardy palm [[Trachycarpus fortunei]], which can be found in gardens and public areas of Victoria. One of these Trachycarpus palms stands in front of City Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/scazon/3616999233/?q=city |title=City hall Victoria palm |publisher=Flickr.com |date=10

However, roads in Victoria are not based on a grid system as in Vancouver or [[Edmonton]], and even most major streets do not follow a straight line from beginning to end as they wind around hills, parks, coastlines, and historic neighbourhoods, often changing names two or three times. There is little distinction between \"streets\" and \"avenues\" in Victoria as there is in other cities such as Vancouver or Edmonton where \"streets\" run north\u2013south and \"avenues\" run east\u2013west, and Victorians are unlikely to use the terms \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\" when giving directions.\n[[File:Mile 0 Victoria B.C..jpg|thumb|left|The Mile Zero sign for Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. Victoria is the western terminus for the highway.]]\nThe compact size of the city lends itself readily to smaller, fuel efficient alternatives to full size passenger cars, such as [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], as areas with significantly steep hills, such as one would find in San Francisco, are very few. Victoria is also in the process of making the use of such methods of transportation more desirable (in a push towards a more \"green\", eco-friendly environment), by offering incentives to use such modes of transport, such as parking spaces in the downtown core specifically designed for vehicles \"{{convert|3|m|ftin|abbr=on}} or less\" in wheelbase size, thus fostering the desirability for ownership of vehicles such as [[Smart Car]]s, [[motorcycle]]s and small displacement scooters. Generally speaking, one can expect to reach most destinations within Greater Victoria within a time span of 20 \u2013 30 minutes, perhaps approximately 60 minutes, dependent on traffic conditions, road construction or other reasons for blockage, where you are coming from, going to, and mode of transport. Travel time is longer during [[rush hour]] times due to large volume of traffic entering the downtown core in the morning and departing at evening rush hour.\n\nVictoria also serves as the western terminus (Mile Zero) for Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway]], the longest national highway in the world. The Mile Zero is in the city's southern part at the corner of [[Douglas Street (Victoria, British Columbia)|Douglas Street]] and Dallas Road, where there is a small sign to mark the spot and a statue to honour [[Terry Fox]].\n\nWithin the Greater Victoria area, private cars, SUVs, and light trucks together make up the majority of trips.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} However, the city boasts an excellent public transit system using a fleet of modern buses, and is beginning to plan for a rapid transit link to the suburban/rural western communities of Langford, Colwood, Metchosin and Sooke.\n\n=== Other services ===\nCoach bus service between downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver or the [[Vancouver International Airport]] that includes the ferry fare is called the BC Ferries Connector run by [http://bcfconnector.com/ Wilson's Transportation Limited]. The coach bus travels on the ferry to Vancouver with separate trips for the bus to downtown and a bus to the [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver International Airport (YVR)]]. Average travel time between the two cities is under 4 hours with an hour and half of that time spent on the ferry crossing.\n\nBus service from Victoria to points up island is run by [https://www.islandlinkbus.com/ Island Link Bus] or [http://www.tofinobus.com/ Tofino Bus]. Both bus services depart from the Victoria bus terminal at 700 Douglas Street, behind the [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont]] [[The Empress (hotel)|Empress Hotel]] and offer trips to destinations further up island and the west coast of the island.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Hatley Castle BC.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Roads University]] is one of three universities in Greater Victoria.]]\nThe city of Victoria lies entirely within the [[Greater Victoria School District]].

The Spanish and British took up the exploration of the northwest coast, beginning with the visits of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez|Juan P\u00e9rez]] in 1774, and of [[James Cook]] in 1778. Although the Victoria area of the Strait of Juan de Fuca was not explored until 1790, Spanish sailors visited [[Esquimalt Harbour]] (just west of Victoria proper) in 1790, 1791, and 1792.\n\nIn 1841 [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] was charged with the duty of setting up a trading post on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, upon the recommendation by [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]] a new more northerly post be built in case [[Fort Vancouver]] fell into American hands (see [[Oregon boundary dispute]]). Douglas founded [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] on the site of present-day Victoria in anticipation of the outcome of the [[Oregon Treaty]] in 1846, extending the [[British North America]]/United States border along the 49th parallel from the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] to the [[Georgia Strait|Strait of Georgia]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n[[File:(1862) VICTORIA FROM JAMES' BAY LOOKING UP GOVERNMENT STREET.jpg|thumb|left|View of Victoria from [[James Bay, Greater Victoria|James Bay]] in 1862.

[[Robert Dunsmuir]], a leading industrialist whose interests included coal mines and a railway on Vancouver Island, constructed [[Craigdarroch Castle]] in the [[Rockland, Greater Victoria|Rockland]] area, near the [[Government House (British Columbia)|official residence]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|province's Lieutenant Governor]]. His son [[James Dunsmuir]] became [[Premier of British Columbia|Premier]] and subsequently Lieutenant Governor of the province and built his own grand residence at [[Hatley Park]] (used for several decades as [[Royal Roads Military College]], now civilian [[Royal Roads University]]) in the present City of [[Colwood, British Columbia|Colwood]].\n[[File:Personnel of the Royal Naval Canadian Volunteer Reserve outside the British Columbia Legislature.jpg|thumb|left|[[Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve]] members stand outside the [[British Columbia Parliament Buildings]] in 1914.]]\nA real-estate and development boom ended just before [[World War I]], leaving Victoria with a large stock of [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] public, commercial and residential buildings that have greatly contributed to the city's character.

[[Pleistocene glaciation]] put the area under a thick ice cover, the weight of which depressed the land below present sea level. These glaciers also deposited stony sandy loam [[glacial till|till]]. As they retreated, their melt water left thick deposits of sand and [[gravel]]. Marine [[clay]] settled on what would later become dry land. Post-glacial rebound exposed the present-day terrain to air, raising beach and mud deposits well above sea level. The resulting soils are highly variable in texture, and abrupt textural changes are common. In general, clays are most likely to be encountered in the northern part of town and in depressions. The southern part has coarse-textured subsoils and loamy topsoils. Sandy loams and loamy sands are common in the eastern part adjoining Oak Bay. Victoria's soils are relatively unleached and less acidic than soils elsewhere on the [[British Columbia Coast]]. Their thick dark topsoils denoted a high level of fertility which made them valuable for farming until urbanization.\n\n===Climate===\n{{climate chart\n| Victoria (Gonzales Marine)\n|  3.0 |  7.0 |  94.3\n|  3.7 |  8.6 |  71.7\n|  4.5 | 10.6 |  46.5\n|  6.0 | 13.1 |  28.5\n|  8.2 | 15.9 |  25.8\n| 10.0 | 17.9 |  20.7\n| 11.3 | 19.8 |  14.0\n| 11.7 | 20.1 |  19.7\n| 10.7 | 18.5 |  27.4\n|  7.9 | 13.8 |  51.2\n|  5.0 |  9.4 |  98.9\n|  3.2 |  7.1 | 108.9\n| float = right\n| clear = both\n| source = [[Environment Canada]]<ref name=\"CCN\">{{cite web | url = http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 | title = Victoria Gonzales HTS, British Columbia | work = Canadian Climate Normals 1971\u20132000 | publisher = Environment Canada | language = English, French | accessdate = 15 February 2013 | date = 2011-01-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130517080751/http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?stnID=113&lang=e&dCode=0&province=BC&provBut=Search&month1=0&month2=12 | archive-date = 17 May 2013 | url-status = live }}</ref>}}\n\nVictoria has a [[Warm-summer Mediterrean climate|warm summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Csb'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 March 2007 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/62twqml5g?url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/pics/kottek_et_al_2006.gif |archive-date=2 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> with fresh, dry summers and cool winters with frequent rainfall.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last         = Kottek\n |first        = M.\n |author2      = J.

The city takes pride in the many flowers that bloom during the winter and early spring, including crocuses, daffodils, early-blooming rhododendrons, cherry and plum trees. Every February there is an annual \"flower count\" in what for the rest of the country and most of the province is still the dead of winter.\n\nDue to its mild climate, Victoria and its surrounding area (southeastern Vancouver Island, [[Gulf Islands]], and parts of the [[Lower Mainland]] and [[Sunshine Coast, British Columbia|Sunshine Coast]]) are also home to many rare, native plants found nowhere else in Canada, including ''[[Quercus garryana]]'' (Garry oak), ''[[Arctostaphylos columbiana]]'' (hairy manzanita), and Canada's only broad-leaf evergreen tree, ''[[Arbutus menziesii]]'' (Pacific madrone). Many of these species exist here, at the northern end of their range, and are found as far south as southern California and parts of Mexico.\n\nNon-native plants grown in Victoria include the cold-hardy palm [[Trachycarpus fortunei]], which can be found in gardens and public areas of Victoria.

The Cougars won the [[Stanley Cup]] as members of the [[Western Canada Hockey League|WCHL]] in 1925 after defeating the [[Montreal Canadiens]] [[1925 Stanley Cup Finals|three games to one in a best-of-five final]].  The Cougars were reincarnated in 1971 as a [[Victoria Cougars (WHL)|major junior hockey team]] in the [[Western Hockey League]], before they moved to [[Prince George, BC|Prince George]] to become the [[Prince George Cougars]]. Today, the Cougars name and legacy continue in the form of the Junior 'B' team that plays in the [[Vancouver Island Junior Hockey League]].  Minor professional hockey returned to Victoria in the form of the [[Victoria Salmon Kings]], which played in the [[ECHL]] from 2004 to 2011, and were a minor league affiliate of the [[Vancouver Canucks]].

The [https://www.cohoferry.com/ Coho ferry] operates as a car and pedestrian/cyclist ferry between the inner harbour of Victoria and Port Angeles, Washington. The [[Clipper Navigation|Victoria Clipper]] is a passenger-only (no vehicles) [[ferry]] which operates daily, year-round between downtown Seattle and the inner harbour of Victoria. The [[Washington State Ferries]] runs a ferry for cars, pedestrians and cyclists between [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]], [[Orcas Island]] and [[Anacortes, Washington|Anacortes]] in Washington State from the port at [[Sidney, British Columbia|Sidney]], up the Saanich peninsula from Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/ferries/vesselwatch/terminaldetail.aspx?terminalid=19|title=WSDOT \u2013 Ferries \u2013 Sidney B.C.

However, roads in Victoria are not based on a grid system as in Vancouver or [[Edmonton]], and even most major streets do not follow a straight line from beginning to end as they wind around hills, parks, coastlines, and historic neighbourhoods, often changing names two or three times. There is little distinction between \"streets\" and \"avenues\" in Victoria as there is in other cities such as Vancouver or Edmonton where \"streets\" run north\u2013south and \"avenues\" run east\u2013west, and Victorians are unlikely to use the terms \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\" when giving directions.\n[[File:Mile 0 Victoria B.C..jpg|thumb|left|The Mile Zero sign for Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway]]. Victoria is the western terminus for the highway.]]\nThe compact size of the city lends itself readily to smaller, fuel efficient alternatives to full size passenger cars, such as [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]], as areas with significantly steep hills, such as one would find in San Francisco, are very few. Victoria is also in the process of making the use of such methods of transportation more desirable (in a push towards a more \"green\", eco-friendly environment), by offering incentives to use such modes of transport, such as parking spaces in the downtown core specifically designed for vehicles \"{{convert|3|m|ftin|abbr=on}} or less\" in wheelbase size, thus fostering the desirability for ownership of vehicles such as [[Smart Car]]s, [[motorcycle]]s and small displacement scooters. Generally speaking, one can expect to reach most destinations within Greater Victoria within a time span of 20 \u2013 30 minutes, perhaps approximately 60 minutes, dependent on traffic conditions, road construction or other reasons for blockage, where you are coming from, going to, and mode of transport. Travel time is longer during [[rush hour]] times due to large volume of traffic entering the downtown core in the morning and departing at evening rush hour.\n\nVictoria also serves as the western terminus (Mile Zero) for Canada's [[Trans-Canada Highway]], the longest national highway in the world. The Mile Zero is in the city's southern part at the corner of [[Douglas Street (Victoria, British Columbia)|Douglas Street]] and Dallas Road, where there is a small sign to mark the spot and a statue to honour [[Terry Fox]].\n\nWithin the Greater Victoria area, private cars, SUVs, and light trucks together make up the majority of trips.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} However, the city boasts an excellent public transit system using a fleet of modern buses, and is beginning to plan for a rapid transit link to the suburban/rural western communities of Langford, Colwood, Metchosin and Sooke.\n\n=== Other services ===\nCoach bus service between downtown Victoria and downtown Vancouver or the [[Vancouver International Airport]] that includes the ferry fare is called the BC Ferries Connector run by [http://bcfconnector.com/ Wilson's Transportation Limited]. The coach bus travels on the ferry to Vancouver with separate trips for the bus to downtown and a bus to the [[Vancouver International Airport|Vancouver International Airport (YVR)]]. Average travel time between the two cities is under 4 hours with an hour and half of that time spent on the ferry crossing.\n\nBus service from Victoria to points up island is run by [https://www.islandlinkbus.com/ Island Link Bus] or [http://www.tofinobus.com/ Tofino Bus]. Both bus services depart from the Victoria bus terminal at 700 Douglas Street, behind the [[Fairmont Hotels and Resorts|Fairmont]] [[The Empress (hotel)|Empress Hotel]] and offer trips to destinations further up island and the west coast of the island.\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Hatley Castle BC.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Roads University]] is one of three universities in Greater Victoria.]]\nThe city of Victoria lies entirely within the [[Greater Victoria School District]]. There is one public high school within the city boundaries, [[Victoria High School (British Columbia)|Victoria High School]], founded in 1876, making it the oldest High School in North America north of [[Portland, Oregon]] and west of [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Most of the elementary schools in Victoria now offer the popular [[French immersion]] programmes in addition to programmes in English. The educational needs of the Francophone community in Victoria are served by [[\u00c9cole Victor-Brodeur]] in the adjacent municipality of [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]]. In addition, within the city proper there are several smaller schools serving segments of the community such as the Chinese School in Chinatown and Christ Church Cathedral School. The senior campus of Glenlyon-Norfolk School is in the Oak Bay neighbourhood.\n\nThe ''[[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique]]'', operates one Francophone school in the Victoria area: ''[[\u00e9cole Victor-Brodeur]]'' in [[Esquimalt]].

The University of Victoria is on the Saanich, Oak Bay border. Camosun College has two campuses, both of which are in Saanich. Royal Roads University is in Colwood.\n\n[[Lester B. Pearson College of the Pacific]] is an international school, in [[Metchosin, British Columbia|Metchosin]], a municipality to the west of Victoria. There are also several private vocational and English ([[ESL]]) training schools available for people who want to learn the English language or upgrade new job market skills. [[Sprott Shaw College]] is a private career training institution that has had a campus in Victoria since 1913.\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Victoria, British Columbia}}\n\nVictoria is the only Canadian provincial capital without a local [[CBC Television]] station, owned-and-operated or affiliate, although it does host a small [[CBC Radio]] station in the 700 block of Kings Road. The region is considered to be a part of the [[Media in Vancouver#Television|Vancouver television market]], receiving most stations that broadcast from across the [[Strait of Georgia]], including the [[CBUT-DT|CBC]], [[CIVT-DT|CTV]], [[CKVU-DT|Citytv]] and [[CHAN-DT|Global]] affiliates.
