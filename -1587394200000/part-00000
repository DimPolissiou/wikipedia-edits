{"title_page": "Layli Goobalay", "text_new": "[[File:Wooden Mancala board.jpg|thumb|right|A wooden [[mancala]] board.]]\n'''Layli Goobalay''' (or '''Layli Goobaly''') is a board game played in parts of [[Somalia]]. It is a variant of the classical [[count and capture]] game ''[[Mancala|mancala]]'' (from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''naqala'', meaning literally \"to move\"), which is one of the oldest two-player strategy board games played throughout the world. ''Layli Goobalay'' means \"to exercise with circles\" in the [[Somali language]].<ref name=\"Rsolg\">{{cite web|title=Layli Goobalay|url=http://www.redsea-online.com/modules.php?name=games&func=display&gameid=1|publisher=Red Sea Online|accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nLayli Goobalay is played on a 2x6 mancala board (i.e., 2 rows of 6 pits each), with 48 seeds. At game setup, 4 seeds are placed in each pit. Similar equipment and game setup are used for in other mancalas.\n\nAt his or her turn, the player takes all the seeds from a pit and [[Mancala#General gameplay|sows]] them counterclockwise. If the last seed of a sowing falls in a non-empty pit that is not a ''Uur'' (see below), [[Mancala#General gameplay|relay-sowing]] applies. Thus, the player's turn ends when the last seed in a sowing is dropped in an empty pit or in a ''Uur'' pit.

At game setup, 4 seeds are placed in each pit.
