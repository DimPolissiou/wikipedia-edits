Its [[county seat]] and only city is [[Ulysses, Kansas|Ulysses]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-31 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nGrant county is located in the High Plains region in the southwestern corner of [[Kansas]], with its western edge being 27 miles from the [[Colorado|Colorado state line]], and its southern edge 26 miles from the Oklahoma border, as these perimeters are currently delineated. It lies between the 37th and 38th parallels, and the 101st and 102nd meridians. The elevation at [[Ulysses Kansas]], county seat in the center of the county, is 3,050 feet above sea level.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe county is 24 miles square, and, generally speaking, is flat land, with the exception of the bluffs and breaks on the Cimarron River, which flows along the south edge of the county, the rolling country bordering the North Fork of the Cimarron River in the center of the county, and along Bear Creek in the northwestern corner. The streams flow eastward and carry little water under normal conditions, although rains falling to the west of the area tend to create flood conditions, as the streams have a fall of as much as eight feet to the mile in some places.<ref name=\"book2\"/> The overall width of the Cimarron River basin valley eroded in southern Grant County indicate in historical times past, it has been a raging river of significant proportions.\n\nThe focal points of prehistory and early history of what became Grant county are the ancient spring on the Cimarron now known as Wagonbed Springs, and the trading path trod by countless natives beside it which eventually came to be called the [[Santa Fe Trail]].<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\n===Prehistoric Era===\nMastodon tusks and bones dated at about five million years ago, petrified trees and ferns deep in the river banks, even imprints of water creatures in limestone, bear witness that western Kansas was not always an arid plain.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nVast deposits of natural gas means that millions of years ago this was a semi-tropical region with much vegetation. Even prior to that, it was an inland ocean.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nWorkers on the railroad in 1922 thought they had found a victim of an Indian raid on the [[Santa Fe Trail]] when they uncovered a skeleton of a young woman while making the railroad cut east of [[Ulysses Kansas]]. They couldn't understand why she had been buried standing up, but they carefully collected her bones and re-buried her in the [[Ulysses Kansas]] cemetery. It can only be conjecture now that this might have been a prehistoric upright burial similar to others found in the region.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nPottery found in the southeast corner of the county was dated by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] at 200-800 A.D., and some found nearby is believed to be older than that.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\n===Native Indian Era===\nFor thousands of years, this has been Nature's pastureland. Millions of shaggy buffalo roamed and bellowed over the prairies, and with them moved the medicine and tools to the nomadic tribes that followed the herds; everything they needed, walking supermarkets. The smallest bone became a needle and the thinnest sinew, thread. Those natives left evidence in passing: weapon points of flint, circles burnt into the soil, grinding stones and scraping knives, axes and hoes.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\n===Spanish Era===\nSome 60 years before the English ventured onto the eastern shores of the North American continent, the history of what was to become far western Kansas was being written in the Spanish language.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nSome segment of the Plains Apache tribe was occupying this space when the first white man came. That man was the Spanish explorer, [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]], returning to Mexico disillusioned and disheartened by the grass huts of [[Quivira|Quividra]] in 1541.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe journal of his expedition states that they returned to New Spain (Mexico) \"along a shorter route known to the natives\". It is probable that the expedition was led from the Arkansas River south through the old Bear Creek pass in the sandhills to what later was the Cimarron cutoff of the [[Santa Fe Trail]], and it is likely that they watered at the [[Wagon Bed Spring (Kansas)|Springs on the Cimarron]].<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThis area shares history with [[New Mexico]], because it was the Spanish who first touched and disrupted the native population of the plains. The first permanent colony in New Mexico was founded in 1598 at [[San Juan, New Mexico|San Juan]] by [[Juan de O\u00f1ate|Juan de Onate]]. A few years later, in 1610, Governor [[Pedro de Peralta]] established the capitol at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. In the 300 years between Coronado and Santa Fe Trail days, there were 10 recorded expeditions east from New Mexico into this region, and nearly every written account mentions another, unauthorized forays onto the plains.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nSome of the Spaniards came, like Coronado, in search of gold and treasure. Some came under orders to search out the French traders who were encroaching upon territory claimed by Spain. And Captain [[Badito, Colorado|Juan Ulibarri]]'s expedition in 1706 was sent to reclaim and return Christianized [[Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico|Picuris pueblo Indians]] who had run away from Spanish domination to what is known as [[El Quartelejo Ruins|El Cuartelejo]] in [[Scott County, Kansas|Scott county, Kansas]]. He was disturbed by a report given him of the French who were living in walled houses on the Chinali, but because of the lateness of the season, he did not seek them further, so we remain in ignorance about which stream was the Chinali. A copy of Ulibarri's journal is in the possession of this writer, and it makes fascinating reading about how he saw [[Colorado|eastern Colorado]] and [[Kansas|western Kansas]] in 1706.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe return of the runaway [[Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico|Picuris]] to the fold was essential. The Spanish were well aware that if one group got away with that trick, the whole native population of New Mexico might well move out from under them. Since the Spaniard had found no gold and small glory, he at least had to hang onto what he had done in the \"name of God\". So the rebels were escorted back to New Mexico \"for the good of their eternal souls\". Incidentally, it was in Captain Ulibarri's journal that he described \"this plains region\" as \"the place where even the Apaches lose themselves\".<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nAnother reason for coming east from [[Pecos, New Mexico|Pecos]] was to capture the natives and return with them as slaves, also in the name of saving their souls. Although this was frowned upon by the government, it became a too common practice.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nMembers of these expeditions, as man has always done, left behind evidence of their passing. The Spanish exhibit at the [[Kansas Historical Society|Kansas State Historical Society]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]] until recently featured only three items of Spanish origin, all from southwest Kansas:\n\n* the Gallego sword from [[Finney County, Kansas|Finney county]]\n* the ring bit found near [[Plains, Kansas]]\n* and another Toledo-made sword found in [[Grant County, Kansas|Grant county, Kansas]]<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe sword was found in 1938 by Ray Kepley in the southwest part of the county, on a hill above the North Fork (of the Cimarron River). Two similar swords have been reported as found along the North Fork, but they cannot be traced now.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nA French religious medallion dating about 1750 was found long ago near [[Wagon Bed Spring (Kansas)|Wagonbed Springs]], and the finder was persuaded to place it in the state Society's museum. On a research trip to Topeka, the request was made to see it and photograph it, but it couldn't be found. Accession records show that it arrived, but it is gone now; the only trace locally of the French intrusion, against which the Spanish guarded so jealously.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nDuring this \"empty\" period, the plains Indian tribes acquired horses, entirely changing the native cultures. The [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa people|Kiowa]], the [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]] and the [[Arapaho people|Arapaho]] and the fierce [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] became forces to be reckoned with, as they pushed southward the less mobile Plains [[Apache]]s.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nAnd more than 20 years before Atchison, Topeka and Lawrence were founded, a busy trail ran through Grant county, carrying eastern goods to Santa Fe and returning with silver and gold.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\n==The Five Flags of Grant County==\nThe Spanish extended their borders beyond their capacity to defend, and that, combined with war and internal troubles in Spain, led eventually to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, encompassing all of Kansas except the extreme southwest corner. The Arkansas river was the northern boundary of Spanish territory, and the 100th meridian (where Dodge City, Kansas now is located) was the eastern boundary in this part of the plains. So the territory in which Grant County is located remained a foreign nation after the rest of the state belonged to the United States.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nHad this southwest corner of Kansas been settled between 1541 and 1854, it would have had a bewildered citizenry. During that time, while only five different nations claimed the area, ownership changed among them at least nine times. In addition, the region was under five separate territorial governments of the United States before becoming a state in 1861.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe first flag over Grant and her sister counties (figuratively speaking) was that of Spain, with Coronado's expedition. The second claim was made by the French explorer, LaSalle, in 1684. Following the French and Indian War, the region was again claimed by Spain.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nMexico's independence from Spain was recognized in 1821. All the territory of New Spain then became the Republic of Mexico, adding the third flag to the collection.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nSettlers from the east poured into Texas through the years, and in 1836, after the defeat at the Alamo and the victory at San Jacinto, Texas became an independent republic, flying the Lone Star flag. The northern and eastern boundaries remained the same.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nAfter a long argument over the slavery question, and some political maneuvering by Sam Houston with the British, this region was annexed to the Union as a rather unwanted part of the state of Texas in 1845.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe area became more treasured when the federal government in 1850 agreed to pay Texas ten million dollars for its claims outside its present state borders.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe Territory of Kansas was organized in 1854, including this area, along with all of Colorado to the Rocky Mountains, and reaching north along the Platte River in what is now Nebraska. The city of Denver, Colorado was founded in what was then Arapahoe county, Kansas, and was named for the territorial governor.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nIncredible as it now seems, when state boundaries were fixed in 1861, a total of 44,509 square miles of land, including the gold fields in the Rockies, was rejected as unfit to be part of the state of Kansas. Only because of \"the possible development of this region as grazing areas\" for eastern Kansas farmers was the western boundary placed as far west as it is.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\n==Establishment of County Boundaries==\nIn 1873, the part of Kansas west of Range 25 was divided into 25 new counties. The new counties were Decatur, Rawlins, Cheyenne, Sheridan, Thomas, Sherman, Lane, Buffalo, Foote, Meade, Scott, Sequoyah, Arapahoe, Seward, Wichita, Kearny, Greeley, Hamilton, Stanton, Kansas, Stevens, and Grant.<ref name=\"book1\">Ulysses 1885-1909 From Boom to Bust; compiled by The Historic Adobe Museum Staff of Ulysses, Kansas; 2009.</ref>\n\nGrant County, Kansas was named after [[Ulysses S Grant|Ulysses S Grant, the 18th President of the United States (1869\u20131877), four star Union General in the USA Civil War, and fought in the Mexican\u2013American War of 1846-1848]].<ref name=\"book2\"/> The initial survey establishing county boundaries was in the summer of 1874.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nIn 1883, Kearny, Sequoyah, Arapahoe, Kansas, Stevens, Meade, Clark and Grant counties disappeared. Hamilton, Ford, Seward, and Hodgeman counties enlarged and Finney County was created.  Grant County was split with the western portion becoming a part of Hamilton County and the eastern portion becoming a part of the newly created Finney County.<ref name=\"book1\"/>\n\nOn June 9, 1888, Grant County was again established as a Kansas county, with original county boundaries, with the first officers of the new Grant County being sworn in on June 18, 1888.<ref name=\"book1\"/>\n[[Image:Grant county kansas map 1905 MSTR.png|thumb|alt=Grant County, Kansas Historical Map 1905\u20131915.|Legend:  Green Lines = present highways, Purple circles = springs, at least in wet years, Blue = creeks, major ravines, & river basins, Gold dot triangles = Indian camps, burial sites, Red 1 = Military Redoubt, Red 2 = \"Old\" Ulysses.

Its [[county seat]] and only city is [[Ulysses, Kansas|Ulysses]].<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |accessdate=2011-06-07 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archivedate=2011-05-31 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Introduction==\nGrant county is located in the High Plains region in the southwestern corner of [[Kansas]], with its western edge being 27 miles from the [[Colorado|Colorado state line]], and its southern edge 26 miles from the Oklahoma border, as these perimeters are currently delineated. It lies between the 37th and 38th parallels, and the 101st and 102nd meridians. The elevation at [[Ulysses Kansas]], county seat in the center of the county, is 3,050 feet above sea level.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe county is 24 miles square, and, generally speaking, is flat land, with the exception of the bluffs and breaks on the Cimarron River, which flows along the south edge of the county, the rolling country bordering the North Fork of the Cimarron River in the center of the county, and along Bear Creek in the northwestern corner. The streams flow eastward and carry little water under normal conditions, although rains falling to the west of the area tend to create flood conditions, as the streams have a fall of as much as eight feet to the mile in some places.<ref name=\"book2\"/> The overall width of the Cimarron River basin valley eroded in southern Grant County indicate in historical times past, it has been a raging river of significant proportions.\n\nThe focal points of prehistory and early history of what became Grant county are the ancient spring on the Cimarron now known as Wagonbed Springs, and the trading path trod by countless natives beside it which eventually came to be called the [[Santa Fe Trail]].<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\n===Prehistoric Era===\nMastodon tusks and bones dated at about five million years ago, petrified trees and ferns deep in the river banks, even imprints of water creatures in limestone, bear witness that western Kansas was not always an arid plain.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nVast deposits of natural gas means that millions of years ago this was a semi-tropical region with much vegetation. Even prior to that, it was an inland ocean.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nWorkers on the railroad in 1922 thought they had found a victim of an Indian raid on the [[Santa Fe Trail]] when they uncovered a skeleton of a young woman while making the railroad cut east of [[Ulysses Kansas]]. They couldn't understand why she had been buried standing up, but they carefully collected her bones and re-buried her in the [[Ulysses Kansas]] cemetery. It can only be conjecture now that this might have been a prehistoric upright burial similar to others found in the region.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nPottery found in the southeast corner of the county was dated by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] at 200-800 A.D., and some found nearby is believed to be older than that.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\n===Native Indian Era===\nFor thousands of years, this has been Nature's pastureland. Millions of shaggy buffalo roamed and bellowed over the prairies, and with them moved the medicine and tools to the nomadic tribes that followed the herds; everything they needed, walking supermarkets. The smallest bone became a needle and the thinnest sinew, thread. Those natives left evidence in passing: weapon points of flint, circles burnt into the soil, grinding stones and scraping knives, axes and hoes.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\n===Spanish Era===\nSome 60 years before the English ventured onto the eastern shores of the North American continent, the history of what was to become far western Kansas was being written in the Spanish language.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nSome segment of the Plains Apache tribe was occupying this space when the first white man came. That man was the Spanish explorer, [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]], returning to Mexico disillusioned and disheartened by the grass huts of [[Quivira|Quividra]] in 1541.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe journal of his expedition states that they returned to New Spain (Mexico) \"along a shorter route known to the natives\". It is probable that the expedition was led from the Arkansas River south through the old Bear Creek pass in the sandhills to what later was the Cimarron cutoff of the [[Santa Fe Trail]], and it is likely that they watered at the [[Wagon Bed Spring (Kansas)|Springs on the Cimarron]].<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThis area shares history with [[New Mexico]], because it was the Spanish who first touched and disrupted the native population of the plains. The first permanent colony in New Mexico was founded in 1598 at [[San Juan, New Mexico|San Juan]] by [[Juan de O\u00f1ate|Juan de Onate]]. A few years later, in 1610, Governor [[Pedro de Peralta]] established the capitol at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. In the 300 years between Coronado and Santa Fe Trail days, there were 10 recorded expeditions east from New Mexico into this region, and nearly every written account mentions another, unauthorized forays onto the plains.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nSome of the Spaniards came, like Coronado, in search of gold and treasure. Some came under orders to search out the French traders who were encroaching upon territory claimed by Spain. And Captain [[Badito, Colorado|Juan Ulibarri]]'s expedition in 1706 was sent to reclaim and return Christianized [[Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico|Picuris pueblo Indians]] who had run away from Spanish domination to what is known as [[El Quartelejo Ruins|El Cuartelejo]] in [[Scott County, Kansas|Scott county, Kansas]]. He was disturbed by a report given him of the French who were living in walled houses on the Chinali, but because of the lateness of the season, he did not seek them further, so we remain in ignorance about which stream was the Chinali. A copy of Ulibarri's journal is in the possession of this writer, and it makes fascinating reading about how he saw [[Colorado|eastern Colorado]] and [[Kansas|western Kansas]] in 1706.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe return of the runaway [[Picuris Pueblo, New Mexico|Picuris]] to the fold was essential. The Spanish were well aware that if one group got away with that trick, the whole native population of New Mexico might well move out from under them. Since the Spaniard had found no gold and small glory, he at least had to hang onto what he had done in the \"name of God\". So the rebels were escorted back to New Mexico \"for the good of their eternal souls\". Incidentally, it was in Captain Ulibarri's journal that he described \"this plains region\" as \"the place where even the Apaches lose themselves\".<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nAnother reason for coming east from [[Pecos, New Mexico|Pecos]] was to capture the natives and return with them as slaves, also in the name of saving their souls. Although this was frowned upon by the government, it became a too common practice.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nMembers of these expeditions, as man has always done, left behind evidence of their passing. The Spanish exhibit at the [[Kansas Historical Society|Kansas State Historical Society]] in [[Topeka, Kansas]] until recently featured only three items of Spanish origin, all from southwest Kansas:\n\n* the Gallego sword from [[Finney County, Kansas|Finney county]]\n* the ring bit found near [[Plains, Kansas]]\n* and another Toledo-made sword found in [[Grant County, Kansas|Grant county, Kansas]]<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe sword was found in 1938 by Ray Kepley in the southwest part of the county, on a hill above the North Fork (of the Cimarron River). Two similar swords have been reported as found along the North Fork, but they cannot be traced now.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nA French religious medallion dating about 1750 was found long ago near [[Wagon Bed Spring (Kansas)|Wagonbed Springs]], and the finder was persuaded to place it in the state Society's museum. On a research trip to Topeka, the request was made to see it and photograph it, but it couldn't be found. Accession records show that it arrived, but it is gone now; the only trace locally of the French intrusion, against which the Spanish guarded so jealously.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nDuring this \"empty\" period, the plains Indian tribes acquired horses, entirely changing the native cultures. The [[Comanche]] and [[Kiowa people|Kiowa]], the [[Cheyenne people|Cheyenne]] and the [[Arapaho people|Arapaho]] and the fierce [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] became forces to be reckoned with, as they pushed southward the less mobile Plains [[Apache]]s.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nAnd more than 20 years before Atchison, Topeka and Lawrence were founded, a busy trail ran through Grant county, carrying eastern goods to Santa Fe and returning with silver and gold.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\n==The Five Flags of Grant County==\nThe Spanish extended their borders beyond their capacity to defend, and that, combined with war and internal troubles in Spain, led eventually to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, encompassing all of Kansas except the extreme southwest corner. The Arkansas river was the northern boundary of Spanish territory, and the 100th meridian (where Dodge City, Kansas now is located) was the eastern boundary in this part of the plains. So the territory in which Grant County is located remained a foreign nation after the rest of the state belonged to the United States.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nHad this southwest corner of Kansas been settled between 1541 and 1854, it would have had a bewildered citizenry. During that time, while only five different nations claimed the area, ownership changed among them at least nine times. In addition, the region was under five separate territorial governments of the United States before becoming a state in 1861.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe first flag over Grant and her sister counties (figuratively speaking) was that of Spain, with Coronado's expedition. The second claim was made by the French explorer, LaSalle, in 1684. Following the French and Indian War, the region was again claimed by Spain.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nMexico's independence from Spain was recognized in 1821. All the territory of New Spain then became the Republic of Mexico, adding the third flag to the collection.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nSettlers from the east poured into Texas through the years, and in 1836, after the defeat at the Alamo and the victory at San Jacinto, Texas became an independent republic, flying the Lone Star flag. The northern and eastern boundaries remained the same.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nAfter a long argument over the slavery question, and some political maneuvering by Sam Houston with the British, this region was annexed to the Union as a rather unwanted part of the state of Texas in 1845.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe area became more treasured when the federal government in 1850 agreed to pay Texas ten million dollars for its claims outside its present state borders.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nThe Territory of Kansas was organized in 1854, including this area, along with all of Colorado to the Rocky Mountains, and reaching north along the Platte River in what is now Nebraska. The city of Denver, Colorado was founded in what was then Arapahoe county, Kansas, and was named for the territorial governor.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nIncredible as it now seems, when state boundaries were fixed in 1861, a total of 44,509 square miles of land, including the gold fields in the Rockies, was rejected as unfit to be part of the state of Kansas. Only because of \"the possible development of this region as grazing areas\" for eastern Kansas farmers was the western boundary placed as far west as it is.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\n==Establishment of County Boundaries==\nIn 1873, the part of Kansas west of Range 25 was divided into 25 new counties. The new counties were Decatur, Rawlins, Cheyenne, Sheridan, Thomas, Sherman, Lane, Buffalo, Foote, Meade, Scott, Sequoyah, Arapahoe, Seward, Wichita, Kearny, Greeley, Hamilton, Stanton, Kansas, Stevens, and Grant.<ref name=\"book1\">Ulysses 1885-1909 From Boom to Bust; compiled by The Historic Adobe Museum Staff of Ulysses, Kansas; 2009.</ref>\n\nGrant County, Kansas was named after [[Ulysses S Grant|Ulysses S Grant, the 18th President of the United States (1869\u20131877), four star Union General in the USA Civil War, and fought in the Mexican\u2013American War of 1846-1848]].<ref name=\"book2\"/> The initial survey establishing county boundaries was in the summer of 1874.<ref name=\"book2\"/>\n\nIn 1883, Kearny, Sequoyah, Arapahoe, Kansas, Stevens, Meade, Clark and Grant counties disappeared. Hamilton, Ford, Seward, and Hodgeman counties enlarged and Finney County was created.  Grant County was split with the western portion becoming a part of Hamilton County and the eastern portion becoming a part of the newly created Finney County.<ref name=\"book1\"/>\n\nOn June 9, 1888, Grant County was again established as a Kansas county, with original county boundaries, with the first officers of the new Grant County being sworn in on June 18, 1888.<ref name=\"book1\"/>\n[[Image:Grant county kansas map 1905 MSTR.png|thumb|alt=Grant County, Kansas Historical Map 1905-1915.|Legend:  Green Lines = present highways, Purple circles = springs, at least in wet years, Blue = creeks, major ravines, & river basins, Gold dot triangles = Indian camps, burial sites, Red 1 = Military Redoubt, Red 2 = \"Old\" Ulysses.

The population was 29,849 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the second-largest city in the [[Metro East]] and [[Southern Illinois]] regions, behind [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]]. Officially founded in 1896, Granite City was named by the Niedringhaus brothers, William and [[Frederick G. Niedringhaus|Frederick]], who established it as a [[steel making]] [[company town]] for the manufacture of kitchen utensils made to resemble granite.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early settlement===\nThe area was settled much earlier than Granite City's official founding. In the early 19th century, settlers began to farm the rich fertile grounds to the east of St. Louis. Around 1801, the area saw the establishment of Six Mile Settlement, a farming area that occupied the area of present-day Granite City, six miles (10&nbsp;km) from [[St. Louis]].<ref name=part1>{{cite web|title=History of Granite City: Part I|url=http://www.granitecity.illinois.gov/community/history_of_granite_city/part1.html|publisher=City of Granite City|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> Soon after, around 1806, the [[National Road]] was to be constructed through the area, but it was never completed.<ref name=\"part1\"/> By 1817, the area became known as Six Mile Prairie, to distinguish it from Six Mile Township.<ref name=\"part1\"/> By 1854, the first railroad was built.<ref name=part2>{{cite web|title=History of Granite City: Part II|url=http://www.granitecity.illinois.gov/community/history_of_granite_city/part2.html|publisher=City of Granite City|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> In 1856, the area known as Six Mile would be changed to Kinder.<ref name=\"part2\"/>\n\n===Granite ware===\nGranite City was founded in 1896 to be a planned company city similar to [[Pullman, Illinois]], by German immigrant brothers [[Frederick G. Niedringhaus|Frederick G.]] and William Niedringhaus for their [[Granite ware]] kitchen supplies factory.\n\nSince 1866, the brothers had been operating the St. Louis Stamping Company, an iron works company, that made [[kitchen utensil]]s in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref name=\"part2\"/> In the 1870s, William discovered an [[enamelware]] process in Europe whereby metal utensils could be coated with enamel to make them lighter and more resistant to [[oxidation]].  At the time, most enamelware was usually just one color as the additions of any colors to the process was inefficient. On June 1, 1878, William applied for Patent 207543 to improve the efficiency whereby a pattern could be applied to enamelware while the enamel was still wet simply by placing a thin piece of paper with an oxidized pattern on top of it.  The paper would fall off in the drying process and the pattern was embedded.  The brothers' pattern made the utensils resemble granite.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patent US207543 A|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US207543?dq=Niedringhaus+enamel|publisher=IFI CLAIMS Patent Services|accessdate=3 June 2015|date=27 August 1878}}</ref> The resulting product was enormously popular.\n\nThe brothers opened the Granite Iron Rolling Mills in St. Louis to provide [[tin]] (imported from [[Wales]]) to its prospering kitchen supplies manufacturer.  The imported tin had a $22 per ton [[tariff]].\n\nFrederick ran for Congress in Missouri in 1888.  During his one term in the [[51st United States Congress|51st Congress]], he successfully urged the passage of a new tariff of 50 percent of value on imported iron and tin.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=eVVWdDcWkkwC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=Frederick+and+William+Niedringhaus+granite&source=web&ots=1-fHsGS7za&sig=Lb6BsoxTRyoYvQCLRFS4EJ40oCs&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result Made in USA: East St. Louis by Andrew J. Theising - Virginia Publishing (June 2003)] {{ISBN|1-891442-21-X}}</ref> With the increased tariff, the U.S. steel industry (including their iron plant) took off.\n\nAs they planned expansion of their [[Bessemer process]] steel works, they were blocked by the city of St. Louis which did not want the expansion. As well, the [[Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis]] planned to tax coal crossing the [[Mississippi River]] into Missouri.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n===Company town===\nIn 1891, the brothers bought {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} from business tycoon [[Lauri Kovalainen|Lars Kovala]].<ref>Cheney Sentinel. September 13, 1889. p. 1, col. 1. (A newspaper in Cheney, Washington).</ref>  This land extended from the [[Mississippi River]] across the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] tracks for their new Granite City.\n\nWith the help of the St. Louis City Engineer, a street grid was laid out with streets listed in alphabetic order plus numbered streets, and the only exception being Niedringhaus Avenue.\n\nThe Niedringhaus family required that its employees live in the town.  Houses were purchased with Niedringhaus mortgages.  Unlike Pullman, however, they did not exert major control over the day-to-day lives of their employees and left the government of the city up to the residents.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nAfrican-Americans were not allowed in the community and instead congregated in [[Brooklyn, Illinois]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nThe plant would later grow to occupy {{convert|1250000|sqft|m2}} and employ more than 4,000 people. The plant prospered until the 1950s when [[aluminum]], [[stainless steel]], and [[pyrex]] replaced iron-based utensils.\n\nThe granite pattern in kitchen utensils, particularly in roasting pans, remains very popular.\n\n===Early history===\nIn 1896, Granite City was officially incorporated as a City within Madison County, Illinois.<ref name=part3>{{cite web|title=History of Granite City: Part III |url=http://www.granitecity.illinois.gov/community/history_of_granite_city/part3.html|publisher=City of Granite City|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> The first seven years went as planned with rapid growth. Henry Fossiek was hired as the first policeman, a School Board of Directors was appointed by the Mayor, four schools opened, the 1st Church of the Concordian Lutheran Church was built, Stamping Company changed its name to National Enameling & Stamping Company (NESCO), and lots were sold for a new subdivision to be named \u2018Granite Park\u2019 (More commonly known as West Granite, today). Then in 1903, a massive flood covered all of West Granite while the rest of the town stayed relatively dry.\n\nIn 1906, a different kind of flood occurred. Ten thousand persons emigrated to Granite City from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]] and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe, during a two-year period. The majority of these immigrants, primarily those from the country of Hungary, moved to present-day [[Lincoln Place (Granite City)|Lincoln Place]]. At the time, this area was called \u2018Hungary Hollow\u2019. During the [[Panic of 1907]], the neighborhood of Hungary Hollow was nicknamed \u2018Hungry Hollow\u2019, as many immigrants starved during this period. The following year, one of the founding fathers of the city and of NESCO, William Niedringhaus, would die, leading to the beginning of a new era in both the company and the city's future.\n\nIt was also during this period that St. Joseph Catholic Church was organized and a canal and levee system were built. Methody Bulgarian Church in America was built in Hungary Hollow for the large number of [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Macedonians]] and [[Bulgarians]] living there. At the time, Granite City had the largest concentration of Bulgarians in the country and boasted the only American newspaper printed in the [[Bulgarian language]].\n\nAround 1903, Granite City expelled its African American residents.<ref>{{cite book|first=James W.|last=Loewen|authorlink=James W.

'Since I was a child, I understood that the city had a law of that sort,' Partney said. 'But when I became Mayor I went through our laws and found we do not have such an ordinance.'}}</ref>\n\n===2000s history===\nAs of 2008, several large manufacturing corporations operate in the city, including [[U.S. Steel]], [[Precoat Metals]], [[Capri-Sun]], [[Kraft Foods]], Heidtman Steel, Prairie Farms, and American Steel. The clothing retailer [[Glik's]] is also headquartered in Granite City. In July 2018, President Donald Trump visited the city to deliver a speech about industry growth at the U.S Steel plant.\n\n==Geography==\nGranite City is located at {{Coord|38|43|4|N|90|7|46|W|type:city}} (38.717849, -90.129529),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> adjacent to the [[Chain of Rocks Lock|Chain of Rocks Canal]] on the [[Upper Mississippi River]], bordering [[Horseshoe Lake (Madison County, Illinois)|Horseshoe Lake]] on its southeastern side. The city sits in the [[American Bottom]], a wide, flat and fertile plain. Although at risk during the [[Great Flood of 1993]], the city never flooded and is protected by a series of levees along both the [[Mississippi River]] and Chain of Rocks Canal.\n\nGranite City is located within a few miles of five interstate highways. [[Interstate 270 (Illinois\u2013Missouri)|Interstate 270]] passes through the northern edge of the city and [[Interstate 255|Interstates 255]], [[Interstate 70|70]], [[Interstate 55|55]], and [[Interstate 64|64]] all pass just to the south and east of the city.\n\nRoute 3 is a major thoroughfare along the western edge of the city and provides access to downtown St. Louis across the recently renovated [[McKinley Bridge]].\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of {{convert|20.70|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|19.29|sqmi}} (or 93.19%) is land and {{convert|1.41|sqmi}} (or 6.81%) is water.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/2010_place_list_17.txt\n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112212943/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/2010_place_list_17.txt\n |url-status=dead\n |archive-date=2013-01-12\n |title=2010 Census U.S. Gazetteer Files for Places \u2013 Illinois \n |publisher=United States Census \n |accessdate=2012-05-03 \n}}</ref>\n\n==Cityscape==\n[[File:Granite City Illinois By Ralph Moran.jpg|left|thumb|Granite City home]]\nGranite City can be divided into eight areas: [[Downtown Granite City|Downtown]], [[East Granite, Granite City|East Granite]], [[West Granite, Granite City|West Granite]], [[North Granite, Granite City|North Granite]], [[Nameoki Strip, Granite City|Nameoki Strip]], [[Bellemore Area, Granite City|Bellemore Area]] and the [[Wilson Park Area, Granite City|Wilson Park Area]]. Most retailers and dining facilities are located on the Nameoki Strip, surrounding Nameoki Road.\n\nThe Wilson park area is home to the recently renovated Coolidge Middle School, former Niedringhaus Elementary School, and Granite City High School as well as the city's crown jewel, Wilson Park. Wilson Park is sometimes called the \"heart\" of Granite City and is known for its nicely kept \"turn of the [20th] century\" homes.\n\nEast Granite is less defined, but is mostly modern residential subdivisions as well as both St. Elizabeth and Holy Family Catholic Schools. East Granite is north of the blast furnace at US Steel.  US Steel's complex was formerly known as the Granite City Steel Co.\n\nDowntown is at the southwestern part of the city and is home to much of the city's industry, including the Granite City Steel Works. Downtown Granite suffered a downturn in the 1970s, which vacated much of its commercial buildings and in turn, urban decay began. More recently, there have been revitalization efforts to revive the downtown area, although they are still in their early stages. These efforts are modeled on nearby cities such as [[Belleville, IL]], [[Edwardsville, IL]], and [[St. Charles, MO]]. Revitalization efforts include installing tree-filled medians on Niedringhaus Avenue, adding recreational businesses such as the three-screen ''Granite City Theater'', repaving streets, granting tax incentives, and adding new zoning restrictions. The original design of what is currently downtown Granite City is based on the City of Washington D.C.\n\nWest Granite is located west of downtown across the railroad lines. West Granite contains both industrial and lower income residential areas and has been struggling to fight its above average crime rate. While Wilson Park may be the Heart of Granite City, West Granite is the History. Attracted by the promise of plentiful jobs, many immigrants from Central-Eastern Europe, primarily Bulgaria, Macedonia and Hungary, migrated to the City in search of good jobs with decent wages. The vast majority of these immigrants settled into housing to the west of the downtown area in a place that would come to be known as \u2018Hungary Hollow.\u2019 By 1916 the multi-national residents of Hungary Hollow applied for and were granted an official name change to Lincoln Place.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 3122\n|1910= 9903\n|1920= 14757\n|1930= 25130\n|1940= 22974\n|1950= 29465\n|1960= 40073\n|1970= 40685\n|1980= 36815\n|1990= 32862\n|2000= 31301\n|2010= 29849\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=28476\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 2, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\">{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |title=American FactFinder |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2016-10-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/QTP11/1600000US1730926|title=Community Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=American Fact Finder|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=Oct 4, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213114239/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/QTP11/1600000US1730926|archive-date=February 13, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> of 2010, there were 29,849 people, 12,214 households, and 7,791 families residing in the city.

The population was 29,849 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], making it the second-largest city in the [[Metro East]] and [[Southern Illinois]] regions, behind [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]]. Officially founded in 1896, Granite City was named by the Niedringhaus brothers, William and [[Frederick G. Niedringhaus|Frederick]], who established it as a [[steel making]] [[company town]] for the manufacture of kitchen utensils made to resemble granite.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early settlement===\nThe area was settled much earlier than Granite City's official founding. In the early 19th century, settlers began to farm the rich fertile grounds to the east of St. Louis. Around 1801, the area saw the establishment of Six Mile Settlement, a farming area that occupied the area of present-day Granite City, six miles (10&nbsp;km) from [[St. Louis]].<ref name=part1>{{cite web|title=History of Granite City: Part I|url=http://www.granitecity.illinois.gov/community/history_of_granite_city/part1.html|publisher=City of Granite City|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> Soon after, around 1806, the [[National Road]] was to be constructed through the area, but it was never completed.<ref name=\"part1\"/> By 1817, the area became known as Six Mile Prairie, to distinguish it from Six Mile Township.<ref name=\"part1\"/> By 1854, the first railroad was built.<ref name=part2>{{cite web|title=History of Granite City: Part II|url=http://www.granitecity.illinois.gov/community/history_of_granite_city/part2.html|publisher=City of Granite City|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> In 1856, the area known as Six Mile would be changed to Kinder.<ref name=\"part2\"/>\n\n===Granite ware===\nGranite City was founded in 1896 to be a planned company city similar to [[Pullman, Illinois]], by German immigrant brothers [[Frederick G. Niedringhaus|Frederick G.]] and William Niedringhaus for their [[Granite ware]] kitchen supplies factory.\n\nSince 1866, the brothers had been operating the St. Louis Stamping Company, an iron works company, that made [[kitchen utensil]]s in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].<ref name=\"part2\"/> In the 1870s, William discovered an [[enamelware]] process in Europe whereby metal utensils could be coated with enamel to make them lighter and more resistant to [[oxidation]].  At the time, most enamelware was usually just one color as the additions of any colors to the process was inefficient. On June 1, 1878, William applied for Patent 207543 to improve the efficiency whereby a pattern could be applied to enamelware while the enamel was still wet simply by placing a thin piece of paper with an oxidized pattern on top of it.  The paper would fall off in the drying process and the pattern was embedded.  The brothers' pattern made the utensils resemble granite.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patent US207543 A|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US207543?dq=Niedringhaus+enamel|publisher=IFI CLAIMS Patent Services|accessdate=3 June 2015|date=27 August 1878}}</ref> The resulting product was enormously popular.\n\nThe brothers opened the Granite Iron Rolling Mills in St. Louis to provide [[tin]] (imported from [[Wales]]) to its prospering kitchen supplies manufacturer.  The imported tin had a $22 per ton [[tariff]].\n\nFrederick ran for Congress in Missouri in 1888.  During his one term in the [[51st United States Congress|51st Congress]], he successfully urged the passage of a new tariff of 50 percent of value on imported iron and tin.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=eVVWdDcWkkwC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=Frederick+and+William+Niedringhaus+granite&source=web&ots=1-fHsGS7za&sig=Lb6BsoxTRyoYvQCLRFS4EJ40oCs&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result Made in USA: East St. Louis by Andrew J. Theising - Virginia Publishing (June 2003)] {{ISBN|1-891442-21-X}}</ref> With the increased tariff, the U.S. steel industry (including their iron plant) took off.\n\nAs they planned expansion of their [[Bessemer process]] steel works, they were blocked by the city of St. Louis which did not want the expansion. As well, the [[Terminal Railroad Association of St. Louis]] planned to tax coal crossing the [[Mississippi River]] into Missouri.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n===Company town===\nIn 1891, the brothers bought {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} from business tycoon [[Lauri Kovalainen|Lars Kovala]].<ref>Cheney Sentinel. September 13, 1889. p. 1, col. 1. (A newspaper in Cheney, Washington).</ref>  This land extended from the [[Mississippi River]] across the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] tracks for their new Granite City.\n\nWith the help of the St. Louis City Engineer, a street grid was laid out with streets listed in alphabetic order plus numbered streets, and the only exception being Niedringhaus Avenue.\n\nThe Niedringhaus family required that its employees live in the town.  Houses were purchased with Niedringhaus mortgages.  Unlike Pullman, however, they did not exert major control over the day-to-day lives of their employees and left the government of the city up to the residents.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nAfrican-Americans were not allowed in the community and instead congregated in [[Brooklyn, Illinois]].<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\nThe plant would later grow to occupy {{convert|1250000|sqft|m2}} and employ more than 4,000 people. The plant prospered until the 1950s when [[aluminum]], [[stainless steel]], and [[pyrex]] replaced iron-based utensils.\n\nThe granite pattern in kitchen utensils, particularly in roasting pans, remains very popular.\n\n===Early history===\nIn 1896, Granite City was officially incorporated as a City within Madison County, Illinois.<ref name=part3>{{cite web|title=History of Granite City: Part III |url=http://www.granitecity.illinois.gov/community/history_of_granite_city/part3.html|publisher=City of Granite City|accessdate=3 June 2015}}</ref> The first seven years went as planned with rapid growth. Henry Fossiek was hired as the first policeman, a School Board of Directors was appointed by the Mayor, four schools opened, the 1st Church of the Concordian Lutheran Church was built, Stamping Company changed its name to National Enameling & Stamping Company (NESCO), and lots were sold for a new subdivision to be named \u2018Granite Park\u2019 (More commonly known as West Granite, today). Then in 1903, a massive flood covered all of West Granite while the rest of the town stayed relatively dry.\n\nIn 1906, a different kind of flood occurred. Ten thousand persons emigrated to Granite City from [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Hungary]] and other parts of Central and Eastern Europe, during a two-year period. The majority of these immigrants, primarily those from the country of Hungary, moved to present-day [[Lincoln Place (Granite City)|Lincoln Place]]. At the time, this area was called \u2018Hungary Hollow\u2019. During the [[Panic of 1907]], the neighborhood of Hungary Hollow was nicknamed \u2018Hungry Hollow\u2019, as many immigrants starved during this period. The following year, one of the founding fathers of the city and of NESCO, William Niedringhaus, would die, leading to the beginning of a new era in both the company and the city's future.\n\nIt was also during this period that St. Joseph Catholic Church was organized and a canal and levee system were built. Methody Bulgarian Church in America was built in Hungary Hollow for the large number of [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Macedonians]] and [[Bulgarians]] living there. At the time, Granite City had the largest concentration of Bulgarians in the country and boasted the only American newspaper printed in the [[Bulgarian language]].\n\nAround 1903, Granite City expelled its African American residents.<ref>{{cite book|first=James W.|last=Loewen|authorlink=James W.

The clothing retailer [[Glik's]] is also headquartered in Granite City. In July 2018, President Donald Trump visited the city to deliver a speech about industry growth at the U.S Steel plant.\n\n==Geography==\nGranite City is located at {{Coord|38|43|4|N|90|7|46|W|type:city}} (38.717849, -90.129529),<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> adjacent to the [[Chain of Rocks Lock|Chain of Rocks Canal]] on the [[Upper Mississippi River]], bordering [[Horseshoe Lake (Madison County, Illinois)|Horseshoe Lake]] on its southeastern side.

Most retailers and dining facilities are located on the Nameoki Strip, surrounding Nameoki Road.\n\nThe Wilson park area is home to the recently renovated Coolidge Middle School, former Niedringhaus Elementary School, and Granite City High School as well as the city's crown jewel, Wilson Park. Wilson Park is sometimes called the \"heart\" of Granite City and is known for its nicely kept \"turn of the [20th] century\" homes.\n\nEast Granite is less defined, but is mostly modern residential subdivisions as well as both St. Elizabeth and Holy Family Catholic Schools. East Granite is north of the blast furnace at US Steel.  US Steel's complex was formerly known as the Granite City Steel Co.\n\nDowntown is at the southwestern part of the city and is home to much of the city's industry, including the Granite City Steel Works. Downtown Granite suffered a downturn in the 1970s, which vacated much of its commercial buildings and in turn, urban decay began. More recently, there have been revitalization efforts to revive the downtown area, although they are still in their early stages. These efforts are modeled on nearby cities such as [[Belleville, IL]], [[Edwardsville, IL]], and [[St. Charles, MO]]. Revitalization efforts include installing tree-filled medians on Niedringhaus Avenue, adding recreational businesses such as the three-screen ''Granite City Theater'', repaving streets, granting tax incentives, and adding new zoning restrictions. The original design of what is currently downtown Granite City is based on the City of Washington D.C.\n\nWest Granite is located west of downtown across the railroad lines. West Granite contains both industrial and lower income residential areas and has been struggling to fight its above average crime rate. While Wilson Park may be the Heart of Granite City, West Granite is the History. Attracted by the promise of plentiful jobs, many immigrants from Central-Eastern Europe, primarily Bulgaria, Macedonia and Hungary, migrated to the City in search of good jobs with decent wages. The vast majority of these immigrants settled into housing to the west of the downtown area in a place that would come to be known as \u2018Hungary Hollow.\u2019 By 1916 the multi-national residents of Hungary Hollow applied for and were granted an official name change to Lincoln Place.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1900= 3122\n|1910= 9903\n|1920= 14757\n|1930= 25130\n|1940= 22974\n|1950= 29465\n|1960= 40073\n|1970= 40685\n|1980= 36815\n|1990= 32862\n|2000= 31301\n|2010= 29849\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=28476\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 23, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=U.S. Decennial Census|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 2, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426102944/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|archivedate=April 26, 2015}}</ref><br />2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\">{{cite web|title=Population Estimates|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2018/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |title=American FactFinder |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2016-10-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/QTP11/1600000US1730926|title=Community Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=American Fact Finder|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=Oct 4, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213114239/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/QTP11/1600000US1730926|archive-date=February 13, 2020|url-status=dead}}</ref> of 2010, there were 29,849 people, 12,214 households, and 7,791 families residing in the city.

The Park District offers baseball, flag football, tennis, soccer, basketball, and hockey programs for the youth.\n\nEvery summer around July 4, Wilson Park hosts the Patriots in the Park program. The program includes live entertainment, carriage rides, carnival rides, food & beverage stands, and the second largest fireworks display in the St. Louis area.\n\nMadison County Transit provides an outstanding {{convert|85|mi|km|adj=on}} network of newly paved, well maintained bikeways throughout the county as well as Granite City.\n\nThe new [[YMCA]], part of the River's Edge Development was recently completed. The complex includes aquatics programs, a youth center, weightlifting, batting cages, basketball/tennis courts, and a child care center.\n\nThere are also two golf courses near Granite City. The Legacy Golf Course and the Arlington Golf Course both offer eighteen hole championship courses.  Horseshoe Lake State Park wraps around [[Horseshoe Lake (Madison County, Illinois)|Horseshoe Lake]], a {{convert|2400|acre|km2|adj=on}} natural lake, the largest lake in the St. Louis area. The park provides a place for picnicking, cycling, fishing, wildlife viewing, and small boating. Hunting is allowed during hunting season and a small primitive campground is located on Walker's Island.\n\nThere are 2 roller skating rinks in the area and [[Confluence Crush Roller Derby]] practices in the adjacent village of [[Pontoon Beach]].\n\n== Transportation ==\n\n===Railroad service===\n[[File:PHRCrew.jpg|thumb|Port Harbor Railroad crew members posing on unit #3086, an SD40-2 diesel electric locomotive built by the Electro Motive Division of General Motors.]]\nThe [[Port Harbor Railroad]] (reporting marks: PHRR) provides railroad service to industrial businesses located at America's Central Port in Granite City.

Recently, the high school underwent a 14 million dollar renovation. The district is notable for its wide array of sports, clubs, and technical programs that students may participate in cost free. Recently, the track, baseball field, and high school gymnasium were renovated. The high school has achieved a 96.3% graduation rate, nearly 10% higher than the state average.  Granite City High School was the 1940 State champions in [[basketball]].  Granite City High has won ten boys' soccer state championships in 1972, 1976-1980, 1982, 1987, 1989, and 1990, and the girls' soccer team won the 2011 state championship.  In addition, the Warrior wrestling team were co-champions in 1965 and currently have more dual meet victories than any other high school in the country.

As a guide to the [[mass]] involved, the entire shell weighs so little that two people can easily pick it up, and the side panel over the doors including the A- and D-pillars weighs approximately {{convert|2|kg|0|abbr=on}}. A 2002 model A2 with standard equipment has a mass of {{convert|895|kg|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe A2 can thus be considered a trailblazer for various newer aluminium-based vehicles, such as the second generation [[Audi A8#D2|Audi A8]], the [[Audi TT]], and Jaguar's recent X350 [[Jaguar XJ]] and 2006 [[Jaguar XK]].\n\nParts of the A2 which are still made of steel include the bulkhead behind the front bumper (the \"slam panel\"), the wiper arm, standard A2 suspension components (the 3l ones are frequently of aluminium alloy), the rear brake drums and the exhaust system.\n\n===Interior===\nThe A2 has a large interior space for the exterior dimensions, including a [[trunk (automobile)|boot]] with {{convert|390|L|cuft|1}} of space when the rear seats are in place. This is significantly larger than the luggage space of the next model in Audi's range, the [[Audi A3]]. Due to the \"sandwich\"-type [[automotive engineering|construction]], similar again to that of the Renault Espace or the Mercedes A-Class, the [[floorpan]] has an upper and a lower portion.  The space in the middle is used to house various components, such as the [[fuel tank]] and the engine's electronics.  The rear passengers also benefit, as their foot space reaches into this sandwich space, creating a comfortable seating position even for tall rear [[car seat|seat]] passengers.  This is in direct contrast to the comfort available on the rear bench of an A-Class. To improve the weight distribution of the vehicle, its [[car battery|battery]] is located inside the boot, under the floor.\n\nThe A2's interior was very upmarket in comparison with other [[supermini]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In both the UK and Europe, there were several choices of seat material and colour, comprising the standard Cirrus cloth, optional Matrix cloth, optional [[Alcantara (material)|Alcantara]]/[[leather]], or full pearl [[Nappa leather]] seat coverings.  Sport models received sport seats with electrically adjustable [[lumbar]] support as standard in jacquard satin cloth.  Seat materials were available in a choice of red, blue, beige (\"jive\" or \"twist\", code 4QC), pale grey (\"platinum\", code EC3), dark grey (\"swing\", 24S) or black (\"soul\", 6PS).  Individual options were also available such as vivid yellow, red or blue seats, steering wheels, gear lever, handbrake lever and door armrests. The color.storm models introduced in 2003 brought bright colours to both the outside and inside of the A2, including \"papaya\" orange. Soft touch materials are used on the doors and contact areas in the centre console, though they have a tendency to wear over time, especially on the climate control keys.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nQuattro GmbH \u2013 as Audi Exclusive \u2013 were prepared to customise the A2 in the same ways that they would any other Audi. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of \"Individual\" painted cars is extremely small; among the several thousand German A2 owners represented in the A2-freun.de forum, only two individual cars have ever been noted. The colours available corresponded to the extended Volkswagen Group palette at the time\u2014including any Volkswagen Group colour and many others too\u2014but the option was expensive, at around \u20ac2000.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sven Hansen |url=http://audia2museum.de/57.html |title=Preise Sonderausstattung \u2013 Audi A2 Museum |work=audia2museum.de |date=27 June 2009 |accessdate=20 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100207080259/http://www.audia2museum.de/57.html| archivedate= 7 February 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> A set of 10 A2s is said to have been created in Almond beige with orange color.storm interiors as dealer demonstrators and at least two of these have been seen on the used market in the past. It is impossible to document the existence of these vehicles, not least due to the lack of co-operation from the German authorities in terms of freely available, reliable, colour information, and that used-car websites are not archived.\n\nThe A2 had many innovative ideas, such as the space floor storage system which was a box that slotted in the rear passenger foot well, a rear cup holder which unclipped, and a double (false) floor boot where items could be hidden from thieves or where the space saver spare wheel could be stored. The warning triangle and first aid kit are stowed directly to the left of the boot opening. The toolkit was stored, depending on equipment, next to the battery. If space was needed for the navigation system and/or the [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] [[subwoofer]], it was moved to the sandwich compartment in front of the right-front seat (driver on UK cars, passenger on LHD ones). The headrests also do not need to be removed from the rear seats when they are folded, and a four-seater can have the rear seats removed in a matter of seconds. The rear seat belts have a clip in the upper section of the c-pillar, so that when the seats are folded and returned to their normal position, the belts do not get tangled.\nMore examples of energy saving can be found in the glovebox light that only turns on when the lights are on and the freewheel pulley on the alternator belt, meaning that the alternator is only used when necessary. The climate compressor is also turned off when the ambient temperature drops below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nThe ECON function of the climate control (where fitted) also turns off the auxiliary heating or the compressor, depending on temperature. This functionality is unaffected by the presence of fuel-powered or electrical auxiliary heating.\n\n===Service Hatch (Serviceklappe)===\nThe front of the car included an unusual design feature called the \"Serviceklappe\" in German \u2013 this translates to \"service hatch\" or \"service panel\".  On early cars, this was a glossy black panel at the lower edge of the [[hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] (hood), where the radiator [[grille]] would normally be sited. Behind it are the filling points for [[motor oil|oil]] and [[windshield washer fluid|screen wash fluid]] and the [[dipstick]]. Thanks to these features, the bonnet does not need to be raised often.\n\nThe bonnet was widely rumoured to be sealed \u2013 ''[[Car and Driver]]'' wrote: \"...feature of the A2 that may foretell the future: the sealed hood\". Actually, the bonnet is easily removed, being held in place by two twist-lock catches. The bonnet, weighing 8&nbsp;kg, then comes away from the car altogether, unlike the usual hinged flip-up arrangement on most other cars. Due to the service hatch, the bonnet does not need to be removed frequently for access to the engine.\n\n==Facelift and additional models==\nThe service hatch is the most obvious indicator of the age of any particular A2. It was changed to matte black for the \"color.storm\" colour schemes, and for [[model year]] 2004 it acquired fake grille slats. However it can be changed easily, so it should not be taken as a reliable age indicator.<ref>[http://www.a2oc.net/forum/archive/index.php/t-1718.html] A2OC</ref>\nVery little else was changed externally during the life of the car. Colours and wheels designs were changed mildly during the production run. The only other external indicator of the age of the car is the [[windscreen wiper]]. Very early models have a traditional blade, but starting in model year 2002, newer cars have a \"flex\" version (\"Aerotwin\" from Bosch, model 760).\n\n===Changes and additions===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | width =\n| image2 = 2001 Audi A2 TDi SE 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| footer = Pre-facelift Audi A2 TDi (UK)\n}}\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 2004 Audi A2 Sport 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2 = \n| footer = Facelift Audi A2 \n}}\n\n===2000\u20132001===\n* February 2000: introduction of the A2 with {{Convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} petrol engine<ref>[http://www.audia2museum.de/59.html] A2 Museum</ref>\n* September 2000: introduction of the {{Convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} diesel\n* June 2001: introduction of the 1.2 TDI engine in 3L into mainland European market.\n\n===2002\u20132003===\n* CAN-BUS is used for the OBD systems, as required by EU Regulations.\n* Aerotwin wiper\n* Aluminium trim pack becomes standard equipment in the UK\n* Diesel-engined A2s after May 2002 no longer have a pre-heater run by diesel, but a powerful internal electrical heating element.\n* May 2002: Use of the 42l petrol tank in all non 3l versions. 3l available with 21l standard tank or 34l tank, allowing a theoretical 1100&nbsp;km range.\n* June 2002: 1.6 FSI engine introduced with the larger (42l) petrol tank and re-modelled rear spoiler (higher position, larger size to increase high speed stability).

This was on public show for the first time at the A2-Club of Germany's annual meeting in [[Amberg]], Germany, in August 2005. Pictures of the event are available on the German A2-freun.de site linked below.\n\nAudi also released an S-line version in Germany as of late 2002, with 17\" 9-spoke \"RS4\" style wheels (standard were 15\"), sports seats with large side bolsters and lumbar support, special half-leather seat coverings with Pearl Nappa leather and Sprint cloth, leather handbrake handle, perforated leather gearstick and 3-spoke steering wheel and 10&nbsp;mm lowered sports [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]]. Additionally, the interior roof lining, the dashboard and carpets were black, the instrument faces titanium-coloured and an S-line badge was added to the rear doors. The driver information system and illuminated vanity mirrors for driver and passenger completed the package<ref>url=http://audia2museum.de/57.html</ref>\n\nIn the UK, the last Audi A2s (from early 2005 to June 2005) were badged as special edition models featuring a reduced price tag, digital climate control and a 'Concert II' radio with CD player as standard. They were the only models available in the UK at this time and were available with either the 1.4 petrol or 1.4 TDI engines. This special edition gave the A2 a final sales boost in the UK.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Lekker/DBM electric version===\nIn October 2010, an A2 converted to electric power by Lekker Energie and DBM Energy completed an early morning {{convert|600|km|mi|adj=on}} drive from [[Munich]] to [[Berlin]] on a single charge.

The \"kolibri\" batteries used in the design are so compact that the vehicle retains its four seats and boot space. A production version would be possible. \"The technology could be implemented today. It is up to industry to use this potential,\" commented Mirko Hannemann, the head of DBM.<ref>{{cite web|title=600 kilometer ohne nachladen|url=http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/0,1518,725418,00.html|work=spiegel.de|date=2 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Remaining numbers in UK and Germany==\n\nThe number of remaining A2s is decreasing over time. The aluminium chassis is frequently written off by insurers due to the relative dearth of \"aluminium specialists\" \u2013 for example one in all of Scotland \u2013 and the training and experience required to repair the shell. Welding is frequently required and aluminium is more difficult to weld than steel due to the lack of colour change when heated which acts as guide to temperature when welding steel. It is also usually welded with [[TIG welding]] which is a higher skill process than [[MIG welding]] that is commonly used with steel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classic.artsautomotive.com/HowToWeldAluminum.htm |title=Welding \u2013 Beginner Guide to Aluminum |publisher=Classic.artsautomotive.com |date=3 September 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122053406/http://classic.artsautomotive.com/HowToWeldAluminum.htm |archive-date=22 January 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nOther repair specialisations are subject to denial on the part of Audi both in the UK and Germany, especially when dealing with Open Sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autobild.de/artikel/ratgeber-dachreparatur-1132888.html |title=Ratgeber Dachreparatur \u2013 Audi mit Dachschaden \u2013 Autoreparatur |publisher=autobild.de |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> Certain dealerships, such as the mentioned Autohaus Rinner in Bad T\u00f6lz in southern Germany, have specialised in roof repairs and replacements.\n\nThe KBA (\"Kraftfahrtbundesamt\") released numbers on request and after payment to the German A2 club which indicate that around 70,000 A2s are registered in Germany as of end November 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Of those, less than 5,000 are 1.6 FSIs.

The D4 version, which used only {{convert|3|l/100 km|abbr=on}}, was \"standard.\" It had no power steering, air conditioning or other extras, with the only optional extra being body coloured door handles and wing mirrors. There were no optional extras because optional equipment adds weight and therefore reduces economy.<ref>Power steering makes use of hydraulic pump which requires additional energy; air conditioning requires a pump and a compressor, which require additional energy; any other \"extra\" on a car requires energy, and the more energy is consumed, the more fuel is needed, thus reducing mileage and economy of the vehicle.

The tested fuel economy was 2.88 l/100&nbsp;km.\n\nThe second version, which was at least available in Germany, was a D3 version which was still capable of 3.0 l/100&nbsp;km.

Due to its construction, the average A2 weighs 830 kg. The last A2s to be produced were built in August 2005.<ref name=\"ETKA\"/>\n\n==Styling==\n[[File:Audi A2 prototype.jpg|thumb|right|Audi Al<sub>2</sub> concept car]]\nThe A2 was a surprise when it debuted only two years after the original Al<sub>2</sub> study. Many initial reviews, including those from ''[[What Car?]]'' and ''[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]]'' in the UK commented on the design.\n\n===Autocar's initial drive verdict===\n\"''The best thing about the A2 is that it isn\u2019t merely a design exercise. Yes, it\u2019s a great car to look at, sit in and touch, but it\u2019s also a riot to drive''\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/CarReviews/RoadTestsDesign/Audi-A2-1.4/231168/ |title=Autocar UK |publisher=Autocar.co.uk |accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[avant-garde]] styling did not, however, win favour with some potential customers.  Audi was reported to be disappointed with the level of sales. The final production was only 176,377<ref name=\"Spiegel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/auto/fahrkultur/0,1518,642497,00.html |title=Spiegel |publisher=Spiegel.de |accessdate=20 October 2010}}</ref> units, in comparison to rival [[Mercedes-Benz]]'s [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class|A-Class]] sales of 1&nbsp;million.\n\n==Design, engineering and construction==\n[[File:Audi A2 L Silber.jpg|thumb|300px|Audi A2 side view]]\nThe overriding theme in the design and engineering of the A2 was summarized by the then Audi UK product manager in an interview after the car won a design award in 2001 as \"create a small Audi, not a cheap Audi\",<ref name=\"dandad.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20040106030227/http://www.dandad.org/inspiration/creativityworks/pdf/innovative.pdf \"Innovative Audi A2\"], British Design & Art Direction (archived link, 6 January 2004)</ref> and the creative brief is said to have been \"Transport four people from Stuttgart to Milan on a single tank of petrol\".<ref name=\"dandad.org\"/>\n\nThe A2 is built with a considerable amount of [[aluminium]] and [[aluminium alloy]], making it weigh significantly less than cars of similar size.{{citation needed|reason=some comparisons/numbers would be good|date=November 2012}} Its reduced weight helps it to use much less fuel than vehicles using traditional steel [[monocoque]]s. Under certain circumstances, consumption for the 1.2 TDI model can be as low as just over {{convert|2|L/100 km|-1}}.  This version of the Audi A2 won the \"Nordic Eco Run\" fuel economy race in 2003, with a consumption of {{convert|2.62|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berg|first=Peter|title=\"Nordic Eco Rrun\" avgjort i \u00d6stersund|url=http://www.resultatservice.com/nyheter/2003/09/0923_1.html|publisher=Snow Rally Sweden|accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref> Even the normal versions with [[petrol engine]]s are capable of {{convert|5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}}. The A2 was also notable for being the first Audi model since the 1970s [[Audi 50]] (type 86) and [[Audi 100]] (type 43) not to be offered with its 'trademark' [[quattro (four wheel drive system)|quattro]] four-wheel drive option. The A2 has a [[drag coefficient|coefficient of drag]] of between 0.25 and 0.29, depending on the specific version.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.audiworld.com/model/a2/news/091499.shtml |title=Audi A2 press release |work=Audiworld.com |accessdate=20 February 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100124041354/http://audiworld.com/model/a2/news/091499.shtml| archivedate= 24 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe A2 still uses a contemporary [[unibody]] construction, with significant elements of [[space frame]] principles,<ref name=\"tms.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/0108/Kelkar-0108.html |title=Automobile Bodies: Can Aluminum Be an Economical Alternative to Steel? |work=tms.org |accessdate=20 February 2010}}</ref> and it is tagged by Audi as an 'Audi Space Frame' design.  The outer [[body panel|panels]] of the body have little or no structural function \u2013 similarities exist with the original [[Renault Espace]] \u2013 and the space frame bears the forces working on the car.  The frame uses casts and extrusions which are laser [[welding|welded]] together to make the space frame. Improvements in shell stability, durability and stiffness, lower weight, and more interior space are results of its construction.  \"The A2, on the other hand, was designed as an aluminum car and the spaceframe has been optimized by parts consolidation, using large, cost-effective castings instead of aluminum stampings\".<ref name=\"tms.org\"/>\n\nUnfortunately, the cost of working with aluminium, particularly with small production runs, meant that the A2 was more expensive than other cars in its sector, competing with the A-class and losing. Much of the high production cost was due to so many parts not being \"off the shelf\" and being specifically optimized for the A2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a2-freun.de/forum/showpost.php?p=795935&postcount=223 |title=A2 Forum \u2013 Einzelnen Beitrag anzeigen \u2013 10 Jahre A2 \u2013 Treffen Neckarsulm am Sa, 28.11.09 \u2013 Diskussionsthread |work=a2-freun.de |accessdate=20 February 2010}}</ref>\nFrom Autobild in 2003: \"The A2 is not one of the models with the highest return on investment\".

As a guide to the [[mass]] involved, the entire shell weighs so little that two people can easily pick it up, and the side panel over the doors including the A- and D-pillars weighs approximately {{convert|2|kg|0|abbr=on}}. A 2002 model A2 with standard equipment has a mass of {{convert|895|kg|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe A2 can thus be considered a trailblazer for various newer aluminium-based vehicles, such as the second generation [[Audi A8#D2|Audi A8]], the [[Audi TT]], and Jaguar's recent X350 [[Jaguar XJ]] and 2006 [[Jaguar XK]].\n\nParts of the A2 which are still made of steel include the bulkhead behind the front bumper (the \"slam panel\"), the wiper arm, standard A2 suspension components (the 3l ones are frequently of aluminium alloy), the rear brake drums and the exhaust system.\n\n===Interior===\nThe A2 has a large interior space for the exterior dimensions, including a [[trunk (automobile)|boot]] with {{convert|390|L|cuft|1}} of space when the rear seats are in place. This is significantly larger than the luggage space of the next model in Audi's range, the [[Audi A3]]. Due to the \"sandwich\"-type [[automotive engineering|construction]], similar again to that of the Renault Espace or the Mercedes A-Class, the [[floorpan]] has an upper and a lower portion.  The space in the middle is used to house various components, such as the [[fuel tank]] and the engine's electronics.  The rear passengers also benefit, as their foot space reaches into this sandwich space, creating a comfortable seating position even for tall rear [[car seat|seat]] passengers.  This is in direct contrast to the comfort available on the rear bench of an A-Class. To improve the weight distribution of the vehicle, its [[car battery|battery]] is located inside the boot, under the floor.\n\nThe A2's interior was very upmarket in comparison with other [[supermini]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} In both the UK and Europe, there were several choices of seat material and colour, comprising the standard Cirrus cloth, optional Matrix cloth, optional [[Alcantara (material)|Alcantara]]/[[leather]], or full pearl [[Nappa leather]] seat coverings.  Sport models received sport seats with electrically adjustable [[lumbar]] support as standard in jacquard satin cloth.  Seat materials were available in a choice of red, blue, beige (\"jive\" or \"twist\", code 4QC), pale grey (\"platinum\", code EC3), dark grey (\"swing\", 24S) or black (\"soul\", 6PS).  Individual options were also available such as vivid yellow, red or blue seats, steering wheels, gear lever, handbrake lever and door armrests. The color.storm models introduced in 2003 brought bright colours to both the outside and inside of the A2, including \"papaya\" orange. Soft touch materials are used on the doors and contact areas in the centre console, though they have a tendency to wear over time, especially on the climate control keys.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nQuattro GmbH \u2013 as Audi Exclusive \u2013 were prepared to customise the A2 in the same ways that they would any other Audi. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the number of \"Individual\" painted cars is extremely small; among the several thousand German A2 owners represented in the A2-freun.de forum, only two individual cars have ever been noted. The colours available corresponded to the extended Volkswagen Group palette at the time\u2014including any Volkswagen Group colour and many others too\u2014but the option was expensive, at around \u20ac2000.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sven Hansen |url=http://audia2museum.de/57.html |title=Preise Sonderausstattung \u2013 Audi A2 Museum |work=audia2museum.de |date=27 June 2009 |accessdate=20 March 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100207080259/http://www.audia2museum.de/57.html| archivedate= 7 February 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> A set of 10 A2s is said to have been created in Almond beige with orange color.storm interiors as dealer demonstrators and at least two of these have been seen on the used market in the past. It is impossible to document the existence of these vehicles, not least due to the lack of co-operation from the German authorities in terms of freely available, reliable, colour information, and that used-car websites are not archived.\n\nThe A2 had many innovative ideas, such as the space floor storage system which was a box that slotted in the rear passenger foot well, a rear cup holder which unclipped, and a double (false) floor boot where items could be hidden from thieves or where the space saver spare wheel could be stored. The warning triangle and first aid kit are stowed directly to the left of the boot opening. The toolkit was stored, depending on equipment, next to the battery. If space was needed for the navigation system and/or the [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] [[subwoofer]], it was moved to the sandwich compartment in front of the right-front seat (driver on UK cars, passenger on LHD ones). The headrests also do not need to be removed from the rear seats when they are folded, and a four-seater can have the rear seats removed in a matter of seconds. The rear seat belts have a clip in the upper section of the c-pillar, so that when the seats are folded and returned to their normal position, the belts do not get tangled.\nMore examples of energy saving can be found in the glovebox light that only turns on when the lights are on and the freewheel pulley on the alternator belt, meaning that the alternator is only used when necessary. The climate compressor is also turned off when the ambient temperature drops below 5&nbsp;\u00b0C.\nThe ECON function of the climate control (where fitted) also turns off the auxiliary heating or the compressor, depending on temperature. This functionality is unaffected by the presence of fuel-powered or electrical auxiliary heating.\n\n===Service Hatch (Serviceklappe)===\nThe front of the car included an unusual design feature called the \"Serviceklappe\" in German \u2013 this translates to \"service hatch\" or \"service panel\".  On early cars, this was a glossy black panel at the lower edge of the [[hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] (hood), where the radiator [[grille]] would normally be sited. Behind it are the filling points for [[motor oil|oil]] and [[windshield washer fluid|screen wash fluid]] and the [[dipstick]]. Thanks to these features, the bonnet does not need to be raised often.\n\nThe bonnet was widely rumoured to be sealed \u2013 ''[[Car and Driver]]'' wrote: \"...feature of the A2 that may foretell the future: the sealed hood\". Actually, the bonnet is easily removed, being held in place by two twist-lock catches. The bonnet, weighing 8&nbsp;kg, then comes away from the car altogether, unlike the usual hinged flip-up arrangement on most other cars. Due to the service hatch, the bonnet does not need to be removed frequently for access to the engine.\n\n==Facelift and additional models==\nThe service hatch is the most obvious indicator of the age of any particular A2. It was changed to matte black for the \"color.storm\" colour schemes, and for [[model year]] 2004 it acquired fake grille slats. However it can be changed easily, so it should not be taken as a reliable age indicator.<ref>[http://www.a2oc.net/forum/archive/index.php/t-1718.html] A2OC</ref>\nVery little else was changed externally during the life of the car. Colours and wheels designs were changed mildly during the production run. The only other external indicator of the age of the car is the [[windscreen wiper]]. Very early models have a traditional blade, but starting in model year 2002, newer cars have a \"flex\" version (\"Aerotwin\" from Bosch, model 760).\n\n===Changes and additions===\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | width =\n| image2 = 2001 Audi A2 TDi SE 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| footer = Pre-facelift Audi A2 TDi (UK)\n}}\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1 = 2004 Audi A2 Sport 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2 = \n| footer = Facelift Audi A2 \n}}\n\n===2000\u20132001===\n* February 2000: introduction of the A2 with {{Convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} petrol engine<ref>[http://www.audia2museum.de/59.html] A2 Museum</ref>\n* September 2000: introduction of the {{Convert|75|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} diesel\n* June 2001: introduction of the 1.2 TDI engine in 3L into mainland European market.\n\n===2002\u20132003===\n* CAN-BUS is used for the OBD systems, as required by EU Regulations.\n* Aerotwin wiper\n* Aluminium trim pack becomes standard equipment in the UK\n* Diesel-engined A2s after May 2002 no longer have a pre-heater run by diesel, but a powerful internal electrical heating element.\n* May 2002: Use of the 42l petrol tank in all non 3l versions. 3l available with 21l standard tank or 34l tank, allowing a theoretical 1100&nbsp;km range.\n* June 2002: 1.6 FSI engine introduced with the larger (42l) petrol tank and re-modelled rear spoiler (higher position, larger size to increase high speed stability).

This was on public show for the first time at the A2-Club of Germany's annual meeting in [[Amberg]], Germany, in August 2005. Pictures of the event are available on the German A2-freun.de site linked below.\n\nAudi also released an S-line version in Germany as of late 2002, with 17\" 9-spoke \"RS4\" style wheels (standard were 15\"), sports seats with large side bolsters and lumbar support, special half-leather seat coverings with Pearl Nappa leather and Sprint cloth, leather handbrake handle, perforated leather gearstick and 3-spoke steering wheel and 10&nbsp;mm lowered sports [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]]. Additionally, the interior roof lining, the dashboard and carpets were black, the instrument faces titanium-coloured and an S-line badge was added to the rear doors. The driver information system and illuminated vanity mirrors for driver and passenger completed the package<ref>url=http://audia2museum.de/57.html</ref>\n\nIn the UK, the last Audi A2s (from early 2005 to June 2005) were badged as special edition models featuring a reduced price tag, digital climate control and a 'Concert II' radio with CD player as standard. They were the only models available in the UK at this time and were available with either the 1.4 petrol or 1.4 TDI engines. This special edition gave the A2 a final sales boost in the UK.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\n===Lekker/DBM electric version===\nIn October 2010, an A2 converted to electric power by Lekker Energie and DBM Energy completed an early morning {{convert|600|km|mi|adj=on}} drive from [[Munich]] to [[Berlin]] on a single charge. Upon arrival, [[Rainer Bruederle]], Germany's Economics Minister, called the test drive a \"world record.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=German electric car sets new distance record|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2010-10-german-electric-car-distance.html|work=PhysOrg.com|date=26 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe car was said to still have 18% of its charge remaining on arrival in Berlin and the average speed was reported as being 90&nbsp;km/h (56&nbsp;mph). The \"kolibri\" batteries used in the design are so compact that the vehicle retains its four seats and boot space. A production version would be possible. \"The technology could be implemented today. It is up to industry to use this potential,\" commented Mirko Hannemann, the head of DBM.<ref>{{cite web|title=600 kilometer ohne nachladen|url=http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/0,1518,725418,00.html|work=spiegel.de|date=2 November 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Remaining numbers in UK and Germany==\n\nThe number of remaining A2s is decreasing over time. The aluminium chassis is frequently written off by insurers due to the relative dearth of \"aluminium specialists\" \u2013 for example one in all of Scotland \u2013 and the training and experience required to repair the shell. Welding is frequently required and aluminium is more difficult to weld than steel due to the lack of colour change when heated which acts as guide to temperature when welding steel. It is also usually welded with [[TIG welding]] which is a higher skill process than [[MIG welding]] that is commonly used with steel.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://classic.artsautomotive.com/HowToWeldAluminum.htm |title=Welding \u2013 Beginner Guide to Aluminum |publisher=Classic.artsautomotive.com |date=3 September 2008 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122053406/http://classic.artsautomotive.com/HowToWeldAluminum.htm |archive-date=22 January 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nOther repair specialisations are subject to denial on the part of Audi both in the UK and Germany, especially when dealing with Open Sky.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autobild.de/artikel/ratgeber-dachreparatur-1132888.html |title=Ratgeber Dachreparatur \u2013 Audi mit Dachschaden \u2013 Autoreparatur |publisher=autobild.de |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2011}}</ref> Certain dealerships, such as the mentioned Autohaus Rinner in Bad T\u00f6lz in southern Germany, have specialised in roof repairs and replacements.\n\nThe KBA (\"Kraftfahrtbundesamt\") released numbers on request and after payment to the German A2 club which indicate that around 70,000 A2s are registered in Germany as of end November 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Of those, less than 5,000 are 1.6 FSIs.

The D4 version, which used only {{convert|3|l/100 km|abbr=on}}, was \"standard.\" It had no power steering, air conditioning or other extras, with the only optional extra being body coloured door handles and wing mirrors. There were no optional extras because optional equipment adds weight and therefore reduces economy.<ref>Power steering makes use of hydraulic pump which requires additional energy; air conditioning requires a pump and a compressor, which require additional energy; any other \"extra\" on a car requires energy, and the more energy is consumed, the more fuel is needed, thus reducing mileage and economy of the vehicle. Additional weight also requires more power during acceleration and while moving on slopes, causing additional energy (=fuel) consumption and thus economy reduction.</ref> It had a fixed rear seat cushion. The tested fuel economy was 2.88 l/100&nbsp;km.\n\nThe second version, which was at least available in Germany, was a D3 version which was still capable of 3.0 l/100&nbsp;km. This version had options for air conditioning, a winter package, and a comfort package, but was not available in all markets.
