The [[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|first season]] premiered on October 22, 2012 on [[Logo TV|Logo]] and featured a new format in which the twelve contestants would be competing and eliminated as pairs until the final episode when one member from either of the remaining pairs would have the chance to win the crown.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that the series would return to Logo for a [[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 2)|second season]]. Premiering on August 25, 2016, ten past contestants returned to compete and the show's format returned to one more similar to the main series; however, it was revealed that RuPaul would not be eliminating anyone and that the queen who won each main challenge would have to select a low-performing queen to send home.\n\nAs of 2018, only two contestants have competed in more than one season of ''All Stars''. As a twist, \"Team Latrila\" from season 1 \u2014 Manila Luzon (originally from season 3) and Latrice Royale (from season 4) \u2014 returned together to compete in season 4 as individual contestants.\n\nAll information is accurate as of the time the season was filmed.\n\n:{{Color box|#FFF7DD|border=darkgray}} Contestant returned to the competition after being eliminated.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n|-\n!

The [[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|first season]] premiered on October 22, 2012 on [[Logo TV|Logo]] and featured a new format in which the twelve contestants would be competing and eliminated as pairs until the final episode when one member from either of the remaining pairs would have the chance to win the crown.\n\nIn 2015, it was announced that the series would return to Logo for a [[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 2)|second season]]. Premiering on August 25, 2016, ten past contestants returned to compete and the show's format returned to one more similar to the main series; however, it was revealed that RuPaul would not be eliminating anyone and that the queen who won each main challenge would have to select a low-performing queen to send home.\n\nAs of 2018, only two contestants have competed in more than one season of ''All Stars''. As a twist, \"Team Latrila\" from season 1 \u2014 Manila Luzon (originally from season 3) and Latrice Royale (from season 4) \u2014 returned together to compete in season 4 as individual contestants.\n\nAll information is accurate as of the time the season was filmed.\n\n:{{Color box|#FFF7DD|border=darkgray}} Contestant returned to the competition after being eliminated.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:center;font-size:96%\"\n|-\n!

{"title_page": "Fair Deal", "text_new": "{{for|the copyright doctrine|Fair dealing}}\n{{Progressivism}}\n\nThe '''Fair Deal''' was an ambitious set of proposals put forward by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] to Congress in his January 1949 [[State of the Union address]]. More generally the term characterizes the entire domestic agenda of the [[Truman administration]], from 1945 to 1953. It offered new proposals to continue [[New Deal]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]], but with the [[Conservative Coalition]] controlling Congress, only a few of its major initiatives became law and then only if they had considerable [[GOP]] support. As [[Richard Neustadt]] concludes, the most important proposals were aid to [[Education in the US|education]], [[universal health insurance]], the [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]], and repeal of the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act]]. They were all debated at length, then voted down. Nevertheless, enough smaller and less controversial items passed that liberals could claim some success.<ref>Richard E. Neustadt, \"Congress and the Fair Deal: A Legislative Balance Sheet\", ''Public Policy'', 5 (1954): 349\u201381, reprinted in Alonzo L. Hamby ed., ''Harry S. Truman and the Fair Deal'' (1974) p. 29</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\nA liberal Democrat of the [[Midwestern]] populist tradition, Truman was determined to both continue the legacy of the [[New Deal]] and to make [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s proposed [[Economic Bill of Rights]] a reality, while making his own mark in social policy.<ref>Mark S. Byrnes, ''The Truman Years 1945\u20131953''</ref>\n\nIn a scholarly article published in 1972, historian [[Alonzo Hamby]] argued that the Fair Deal reflected the \"vital center\" approach to liberalism which rejected totalitarianism, was suspicious of excessive concentrations of government power, and honored the New Deal as an effort to achieve a \"democratic socialist society.\" Solidly based upon the New Deal tradition in its advocacy of wide-ranging social legislation, the Fair Deal differed enough to claim a separate identity. The Depression did not return after the war and the Fair Deal had to contend with prosperity and an optimistic future. The Fair Dealers thought in terms of abundance rather than depression scarcity. Economist [[Leon Keyserling]] argued that the liberal task was to spread the benefits of abundance throughout society by stimulating economic growth. Agriculture Secretary [[Charles F. Brannan]] wanted to unleash the benefits of agricultural abundance and to encourage the development of an urban-rural Democratic coalition. However the [[Brannan Plan]] was defeated by strong conservative opposition in Congress and by his unrealistic confidence in the possibility uniting urban labor and farm owners who distrusted rural insurgency. The [[Korean War]] made military spending the nation's priority and killed almost the whole Fair Deal but did encourage the pursuit of economic growth.<ref>Alonzo L. Hamby, \"The Vital Center, the Fair Deal, and the Quest for a Liberal Political Economy,\" ''American Historical Review,'' June 1972, Vol. 77 Issue 3, pp 653\u201378 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1870345 online at JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==21 Point Program==\n\nIn September 1945, Truman addressed Congress and presented a 21-point program of domestic legislation outlining a series of proposed actions in the fields of economic development and social welfare.<ref name=\"Hamby 1974 p. vii\">Hamby, Alonzo L.

Many of these proposed reforms, however, were never realized due the opposition of the conservative majority in Congress. Despite these setbacks, Truman's proposals to Congress became more and more abundant over the course of his presidency, and by 1948 a legislative program that was more comprehensive came to be known as the \"Fair Deal\".<ref>Hamby, ''Harry S. Truman and the Fair Deal'', page 15.</ref> In his 1949 [[State of the Union address]] to Congress on January 5, 1949, Truman stated that \"Every segment of our population, and every individual, has a right to expect from his government a fair deal.\" Amongst the proposed measures included federal aid to education,<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/truman-delivers-his-fair-deal-speech Truman delivers his Fair Deal speech \u2014 History.com This Day in History \u2014 1/5/1949].

Public Versus Private Power During the Truman Administration : a Study of Fair Deal Liberalism. New York: Peter Lang, 1997. 35\u201336.</ref> The Fair Deal faced opposition by a coalition of conservative Republicans and predominantly southern conservative Democrats. However, despite strong opposition, there were elements of Truman's agenda that did win congressional approval, such as the public housing subsidies cosponsored by Republican [[Robert A. Taft]] under the [[Housing Act of 1949|1949 National Housing Act]], which funded [[slum clearance]] and the construction of 810,000 units of low-income housing over a period of six years.<ref>Robert A. Taft, ''The Papers of Robert A. Taft: 1949\u20131953'' edited by Clarence E. Wunderlin (2006) p. 81</ref>\n\nTruman was also helped by the election of a Democratic Congress later in his term. According to Eric Leif Davin, the 1949\u201350 Congress \u2018was the most liberal Congress since 1938 and produced more \u201cNew-Deal-Fair Deal\u201d legislation than any Congress between 1938 and Johnson's Great Society of the mid-1960s.\u201d As noted by one study\n\n::\u201cThis was the Congress that reformed the Displaced Persons Act, increased the minimum wage, doubled the hospital construction program, authorized the National Science Foundation and the rural telephone program, suspended the \u2018sliding scale\u2019 on price supports, extended the soil conservation program, provided new grants for planning state and local public works and plugged the long-standing merger loophole in the Clayton Act\u2026Moreover, as protector, as defender, wielder of the veto against encroachments on the liberal preserve, Truman left a record of considerable success \u2013 an aspect of the Fair Deal not to be discounted.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5FNJxIQFG0C&pg=PA348&dq=liberal+Congress+1938#v=onepage&q=liberal%20Congress%201938&f=false |title = Crucible of Freedom: Workers' Democracy in the Industrial Heartland, 1914\u20131960|isbn = 9780739122396|last1 = Davin|first1 = Eric Leif|date = November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Truman was unable to implement his Fair Deal program in its entirety, a great deal of social and economic progress took place in the late Forties and early Fifties. A Census report confirmed that gains in housing, education, living standards, and income under the Truman administration were unparalleled in American history. By 1953, 62 million Americans had jobs, a gain of 11 million in seven years, while unemployment had all but vanished. Farm income, dividends, and corporate income were at all-time highs, and there had not been a failure of an insured bank in nearly nine years. The [[minimum wage]] had also been increased while [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits had been doubled, and 8 million veterans had attended college by the end of the Truman administration as a result of the [[G.I. Bill]],<ref name=\"Truman by David McCullough\">''[[Truman (book)|Truman]]'' by [[David McCullough]]</ref> which subsidized the businesses, training, education, and housing of millions of returning veterans.<ref name=\"Byrnes\"/>\n\nMillions of homes had been financed through previous government programs, and a start was made in [[slum]] clearance. Poverty was also significantly reduced, with one estimate suggesting that the percentage of Americans living in poverty had fallen from 33% of the population in 1949 to 28% by 1952.<ref>The Welfare State Reader, edited by Christopher Pierson and Francis G. Castles</ref> Incomes had risen faster than prices, which meant that real living standards were considerably higher than seven years earlier. Progress had also been made in civil rights, with the [[desegregation]] of both the federal civil Service and the armed forces and the creation of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|Commission on Civil Rights]]. In fact, according to one historian, Truman had \u201cdone more than any President since [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] to awaken American conscience to the issues of civil rights\".<ref name=\"Truman by David McCullough\"/>\n\n==Legislation and programs==\n\nNote: This listing contains reforms drawn up by the Truman Administration together with reforms drawn up by individual Congressmen. The latter have been included because it is arguable that the progressive nature of these reforms (such as the Water Pollution Law, which was partly a Republican initiative) was compatible with the liberalism of the Fair Deal.\n\n===Civil Rights Movement===\n\nAs Senator, Truman had not supported the nascent [[Civil Rights Movement]]. In a 1947 speech to the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which marked the first time a sitting President had ever addressed the group, Truman said \"Every man should have the right to a decent home, the right to an education, the right to adequate medical care, the right to a worthwhile job, the right to an equal share in the making of public decisions through the ballot, and the right to a fair trial in a fair court.\"<ref>{{cite conference | author=President Truman | title=President Truman's Address to the NAACP, June 28, 1947 | booktitle=National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. | year=1947 }}</ref>\n\nAs President, he put forward many civil rights programs but they were met with a lot of resistance by southern Democrats. All his legislative proposals were blocked. However, he used presidential executive orders to end discrimination in the armed forces and denied government contracts to firms with racially discriminatory practices. He also named African Americans to federal posts. Except for nondiscrimination provisions of the [[Housing Act of 1949]], Truman had to be content with civil rights' gains achieved by executive order or through the federal courts. Vaughan argues that by continuing appeals to Congress for civil rights legislation, Truman helped reverse the long acceptance of segregation and discrimination by establishing integration as a moral principle.<ref>Philip H.

Truman]] to Congress in his January 1949 [[State of the Union address]]. More generally the term characterizes the entire domestic agenda of the [[Truman administration]], from 1945 to 1953. It offered new proposals to continue [[New Deal]] [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberalism]], but with the [[Conservative Coalition]] controlling Congress, only a few of its major initiatives became law and then only if they had considerable [[GOP]] support. As [[Richard Neustadt]] concludes, the most important proposals were aid to [[Education in the US|education]], [[universal health insurance]], the [[Fair Employment Practices Commission]], and repeal of the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act]]. They were all debated at length, then voted down. Nevertheless, enough smaller and less controversial items passed that liberals could claim some success.<ref>Richard E. Neustadt, \"Congress and the Fair Deal: A Legislative Balance Sheet\", ''Public Policy'', 5 (1954): 349\u201381, reprinted in Alonzo L. Hamby ed., ''Harry S. Truman and the Fair Deal'' (1974) p. 29</ref>\n\n==Philosophy==\nA liberal Democrat of the [[Midwestern]] populist tradition, Truman was determined to both continue the legacy of the [[New Deal]] and to make [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s proposed [[Economic Bill of Rights]] a reality, while making his own mark in social policy.<ref>Mark S. Byrnes, ''The Truman Years 1945\u20131953''</ref>\n\nIn a scholarly article published in 1972, historian [[Alonzo Hamby]] argued that the Fair Deal reflected the \"vital center\" approach to liberalism which rejected totalitarianism, was suspicious of excessive concentrations of government power, and honored the New Deal as an effort to achieve a \"democratic socialist society.\" Solidly based upon the New Deal tradition in its advocacy of wide-ranging social legislation, the Fair Deal differed enough to claim a separate identity. The Depression did not return after the war and the Fair Deal had to contend with prosperity and an optimistic future. The Fair Dealers thought in terms of abundance rather than depression scarcity. Economist [[Leon Keyserling]] argued that the liberal task was to spread the benefits of abundance throughout society by stimulating economic growth. Agriculture Secretary [[Charles F. Brannan]] wanted to unleash the benefits of agricultural abundance and to encourage the development of an urban-rural Democratic coalition. However the [[Brannan Plan]] was defeated by strong conservative opposition in Congress and by his unrealistic confidence in the possibility uniting urban labor and farm owners who distrusted rural insurgency. The [[Korean War]] made military spending the nation's priority and killed almost the whole Fair Deal but did encourage the pursuit of economic growth.<ref>Alonzo L.

Many of these proposed reforms, however, were never realized due the opposition of the conservative majority in Congress. Despite these setbacks, Truman's proposals to Congress became more and more abundant over the course of his presidency, and by 1948 a legislative program that was more comprehensive came to be known as the \"Fair Deal\".<ref>Hamby, ''Harry S.

According to Eric Leif Davin, the 1949\u201350 Congress \u2018was the most liberal Congress since 1938 and produced more \u201cNew-Deal-Fair Deal\u201d legislation than any Congress between 1938 and Johnson\u2019s Great Society of the mid-1960s.\u201d As noted by one study\n\n::\u201cThis was the Congress that reformed the Displaced Persons Act, increased the minimum wage, doubled the hospital construction program, authorized the National Science Foundation and the rural telephone program, suspended the \u2018sliding scale\u2019 on price supports, extended the soil conservation program, provided new grants for planning state and local public works and plugged the long-standing merger loophole in the Clayton Act\u2026Moreover, as protector, as defender, wielder of the veto against encroachments on the liberal preserve, Truman left a record of considerable success \u2013 an aspect of the Fair Deal not to be discounted.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=U5FNJxIQFG0C&pg=PA348&dq=liberal+Congress+1938#v=onepage&q=liberal%20Congress%201938&f=false |title = Crucible of Freedom: Workers' Democracy in the Industrial Heartland, 1914\u20131960|isbn = 9780739122396|last1 = Davin|first1 = Eric Leif|date = November 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Truman was unable to implement his Fair Deal program in its entirety, a great deal of social and economic progress took place in the late Forties and early Fifties. A Census report confirmed that gains in housing, education, living standards, and income under the Truman administration were unparalleled in American history. By 1953, 62 million Americans had jobs, a gain of 11 million in seven years, while unemployment had all but vanished. Farm income, dividends, and corporate income were at all-time highs, and there had not been a failure of an insured bank in nearly nine years. The [[minimum wage]] had also been increased while [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits had been doubled, and 8 million veterans had attended college by the end of the Truman administration as a result of the [[G.I. Bill]],<ref name=\"Truman by David McCullough\">''[[Truman (book)|Truman]]'' by [[David McCullough]]</ref> which subsidized the businesses, training, education, and housing of millions of returning veterans.<ref name=\"Byrnes\"/>\n\nMillions of homes had been financed through previous government programs, and a start was made in [[slum]] clearance. Poverty was also significantly reduced, with one estimate suggesting that the percentage of Americans living in poverty had fallen from 33% of the population in 1949 to 28% by 1952.<ref>The Welfare State Reader, edited by Christopher Pierson and Francis G. Castles</ref> Incomes had risen faster than prices, which meant that real living standards were considerably higher than seven years earlier. Progress had also been made in civil rights, with the [[desegregation]] of both the federal civil Service and the armed forces and the creation of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights|Commission on Civil Rights]]. In fact, according to one historian, Truman had \u201cdone more than any President since [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] to awaken American conscience to the issues of civil rights\".<ref name=\"Truman by David McCullough\"/>\n\n==Legislation and programs==\n\nNote: This listing contains reforms drawn up by the Truman Administration together with reforms drawn up by individual Congressmen. The latter have been included because it is arguable that the progressive nature of these reforms (such as the Water Pollution Law, which was partly a Republican initiative) was compatible with the liberalism of the Fair Deal.\n\n===Civil Rights Movement===\n\nAs Senator, Truman had not supported the nascent [[Civil Rights Movement]]. In a 1947 speech to the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which marked the first time a sitting President had ever addressed the group, Truman said \"Every man should have the right to a decent home, the right to an education, the right to adequate medical care, the right to a worthwhile job, the right to an equal share in the making of public decisions through the ballot, and the right to a fair trial in a fair court.\"<ref>{{cite conference | author=President Truman | title=President Truman's Address to the NAACP, June 28, 1947 | booktitle=National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. | year=1947 }}</ref>\n\nAs President, he put forward many civil rights programs but they were met with a lot of resistance by southern Democrats. All his legislative proposals were blocked. However, he used presidential executive orders to end discrimination in the armed forces and denied government contracts to firms with racially discriminatory practices. He also named African Americans to federal posts. Except for nondiscrimination provisions of the [[Housing Act of 1949]], Truman had to be content with civil rights' gains achieved by executive order or through the federal courts. Vaughan argues that by continuing appeals to Congress for civil rights legislation, Truman helped reverse the long acceptance of segregation and discrimination by establishing integration as a moral principle.<ref>Philip H.

{"title_page": "Baqashot", "text_new": "{{short description|Collection of supplications, songs, and prayers sung by the Sephardic Syrian, Moroccan, and Turkish Jewish communities each week on Shabbat mornings}}\n{{JewishMusic}}\n\nThe '''Baqashot''' (or \"''bakashot''\", {{lang-he-n|\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05d1\u05e7\u05e9\u05d5\u05ea}}) are a collection of supplications, songs, and prayers that have been sung by the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] Syrian, Moroccan, and Turkish [[Jew]]ish communities for centuries each week on [[Shabbat]] mornings from the early hours of the morning until dawn. They are usually recited during the weeks of winter, from the Jewish festival of [[Sukkot]] through [[Purim]], when the nights are much longer. The baqashot services can last for three to four hours. The [[Ades Synagogue]] in Jerusalem is the center of the Syrian practice today, and communities in Ashdod and Montreal are the center of the Moroccan practice.\n\n==History==\n\nThe custom of singing Baqashot originated in Spain towards the time of the expulsion, but took on increased momentum in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] circle in [[Safed]] in the 16th century. Baqashot probably evolved out of the tradition of saying petitionary prayers before dawn and was spread from [[Safed]] by the followers of [[Isaac Luria]] (16th century).  With the spread of Safed Kabbalistic doctrine, and coffee consumption\u2014which allowed devotees to stay awake through the night<ref>Horowitz, Elliott. \u201cCoffee, Coffeehouses, and the Nocturnal Rituals of Early Modern Jewry.\u201d AJS Review, vol. 14, no. 1, 1989, pp. 17\u201346. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1486283.</ref>\u2014the singing of Baqashot reached countries all round the Mediterranean and became customary in the communities of Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, Rhodes, Greece, Yugoslavia, Egypt, Turkey and Syria.  It also influenced the Kabbalistically oriented confraternities in 18th-century Italy, and even became customary for a time in Sephardic communities in western Europe, such as Amsterdam and London.  (In Amsterdam the Shabbat service still begins with a small number of baqashot.  In London the tunes for one or two of them have been preserved in the literature but the practice no longer exists.)  By the turn of the 20th century Baqashot had become a widespread religious practice in several communities in Jerusalem as a communal form of prayer. \n\nIn communities such as those of [[Aleppo]], Turkey and Morocco, the singing of Baqashot expanded to vast proportions.  In those countries special books were compiled naming the tunes and [[Arabic maqam|maqam]]at together with the text of the hymns, in order to facilitate the singing of Baqashot by the congregation.  In these communities it was customary to rise from bed in the night on Shabbat in the winter months, when the nights are longer, and assemble in synagogue to sing Baqashot for four hours until the time for the morning service.\n\nEach country had its own collection of baqashot, and there is often little or no overlap between the collections of different countries.<ref> At least 4 baqashot are shared between the Moroccan and Syrian repertoires, namely \u05d9\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05da \u05e8\u05e2\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9, \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e7\u05e9\u05d4\n \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd, \u05e9\u05d7\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d1\u05e7\u05e9\u05da </ref> The Moroccan collection is known as \"Shir Yedidot\" (Marrakesh 1921): unlike in the Aleppo tradition, where the baqashot service is the same every shabbat, the Moroccan tradition has a different set of baqashot for each week.  The Amsterdam collection is set out in the first part of Joseph Gallego's ''Imre No'am'': the contents of this were probably derived from the Salonica tradition.\n\n== The Turkish Tradition ==\nThe equivalent tradition is known as \"Shirat Hamaftirim\", and the songs are performed by choirs of \"maftirim\".  The music and style of singing are based on [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[Ottoman classical music]].  This tradition flourished in Adrianople (present-day [[Edirne]]) in European Turkey, as well as in [[Salonica]] and [[Istanbul]] from the 17th century until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe scholar Abraham Danon attested to the Edirne (Adrianople) maftirim tradition in this source from the late 1920s:<ref name=\"seroussi\">{{cite journal |last1=Seroussi |first1=Edwin |title=An Historical Overview of the Maftirim Phenomenon |date=2008}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The institution for which these songs were intended is the choir called Maftirim, who are the singers or assistant cantors. From ancient times this was the custom in Adrianople: each Sabbath morning, before the morning prayer (in recent times they shift to the time of the Sabbath eve), the Levite's disciples gathered at the Portugal synagogue (and sang with their throats songs to praise the Lord and afterwards each one walked to his synagogue (which were thirteen in number before the great fire) where the [opening] prayer ''Barukh she-amar'' did not start before the ending of the ''Qaddish'' by the Maftirim. In the course of time, the cantors joined with the Levite's assistants (''mezammerim'') and sang together songs to the joy of the listeners gathered around them who were avid for the songs and they opened their mouths as if they wanted to swallow rain. This is the reason the majority of the [Jewish] inhabitants of Adrianople had some expertise in the art of song, because since their youth they were educated on the laps [of music]. I heard that the refugees who flew from that city due to the War moved to Constantinople where they reestablished the gathering of the Maftirim at the Galata quarter...}}\n\nIn both [[Edirne]] and [[Salonica]], the ''maftirim'' would sing a [[fas\u0131l]] for each Shabbat in a different [[makam]].<ref name=\"seroussi\"></ref> The ''maftirim'' would begin with a prayer in Aramaic ''Beresh ormanuta,'' followed by vocal improvisations of Biblical verses. Finally, the service would end with ''Mizmor shir leyom hashabbat'' and ''Qaddish''.\n\nThe definitive edition of ''baqashot'' and ''piyyutim'' in the Ottoman-Turkish tradition was published in 1926 by Eliyahu Navon with the help of the Hazzan Avraham Behor Papo. This tome, ''Shire Israel be-Eres ha-Kedem'' (\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d9 \u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05d1\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d3\u05dd), contained close to 500 piyyutim organized according to 39 [[makam|makalmar]] (including obscure and compound makamlar).

Later composers from the 18th century include Rabbi Yaaqob ibn Sur[https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A8] (1673-1753) and [[David Ben Hassin|R' David Ben Hassin]] (1727-1795), one of the most prolific Jewish Moroccan poets.\n\nAlthough the ''baqashot'' are organized by [[Weekly Torah Portion|the weekly Torah portions]], the themes of the ''piyyutim'' range from [[Shabbat]] and Jewish holidays such as [[Purim]], to [[Zion]] and [[Kabbalah]]. Some of the ''piyyutim'' are in [[Judeo-Arabic]]. As a whole, the Moroccan ''baqashot'' represent close to 8 centuries of Sephardic poetry and music.\n\nOne of the first printed collections of Andalusian ''baqashot'' was arranged by Rabbi Abraham Elmaliah from Mogador in 1856 under the name ''Soba' Semahot'' (\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05e2 \u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea). This was a collection of all the \"old\" (\u05dc\u05e7\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd) manuscripts of ''baqashot'' and ''piyyutim,'' as well as original compositions.<ref name=\"shiryedidot\"></ref> Another collection ''Roni VeSimhi'' (\u05e8\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d5\u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u05d9)  was published in 1890 by Rabbi David Yefalah, also from Mogador, with many additional ''piyyutim'' assembled from manuscripts.\n\nIn 1921, a group of prominent Moroccan ''hazzanim'' standardized the structure of the ''baqashot'' into its modern form. These included Rabbi David Yefalah, R' David Elqayim, and R' David Afriat, all from [[Essaouira]], and R' Hayyim Atar from [[Marrakesh]].<ref name=\"shiryedidot\"></ref> The first volume containing older ''piyyutim'' was called ''Shir Yedidot,'' while the second volume containing newer compositions was called ''Keter Kehuna.'' Many editions of Shir Yedidot were subsequently published in 1931, 1979, and more recently in 1999.\n\n==The Syrian tradition==\n\nIn Aleppo, Syria this custom seems to go back about 500 years. Most of the community would arise at 3:00AM to sing Baqashot and to listen to the voices of the Hazanim, Paytanim, and Meshorerim. When they arrived at Mizmor Shir LeYom HaShabbat they would break to listen to a sermon by one of the Rabbis who discussed the Parashah of the week. When he concluded they would begin Mizmor Shir LeYom HaShabbat and sing all the rest of the Baqashot.\n\nThe Syrian tradition was introduced to Jerusalem by Raphael Altaras, who came to that city from Aleppo in 1845 and founded a Baqashot circle at the ''Kehal Tsiyon'' synagogue.  In this way the custom of Baqashot became part of the mainstream Jerusalem Sephardic tradition.  Another important influence was Jacob Ades (1857\u20131925), who immigrated to Jerusalem in 1895 and introduced the tradition to the Persian and Bukharan communities.  The main centre of the tradition today is the [[Ades Synagogue]] in [[Nachlaot]], where the leading spirit was [[rabbi]] [[Chaim Shaul Abud]].\n\nThe Aleppian Baqashot did not only reach Jerusalem. The Jews of Aleppo took this custom with them wherever they went: to Turkey, Cairo, Mexico, Argentina and Brooklyn, New York.\nEach of these communities preserved this custom in the original Halabi style without all the changes and embellishments that have been added to the Baqashot by Jerusalem cantors over the years. Though these communities do not perform the Baqashot on a weekly basis, nevertheless, they use the melodies of the Baqashot throughout Saturday morning prayers.\n\n==Themes in the Syrian Tradition==\n\nThere is a total of 66 songs in the Syrian Baqashot book, and the collection is now regarded as closed, unlike the general body of [[pizmonim]], where new pizmonim are still composed for special occasions.  Each song is shown with its maqam, but they follow a fixed order of recitation which does not depend on the maqamat of the different songs. There are many sections within the Baqashot. The sections are separated by different Biblical verses to be chanted in a different maqam. \n\nThe songs principally consist of the praise of God, songs for Shabbat, songs of longing for the Holy Land and so on, and include some [[Piyut|piyyutim]] taken from the main body of the prayer book. These songs are considered more ancient and sacred than other [[pizmonim]] (Hebrew songs).  Many of the songs contain acrostics identifying the author of that specific composition. \n\nBaqashot are full of mystical allusions and traditions. Some of the songs contain references to some of the most sacred Jewish traditions. The following are examples of thematic songs:\n* Song 1 and 34: listing of the 10 \"[[Sefirot]]\" (attributes) in the [[Kabbalah]].\n* Song 2: refers to the return to Zion in the time of redemption.\n* Song 6 and 7: a song with each stanza ending with \"boqer\" (morning).\n* Song 9: a song with each stanza ending with \"yom\" (day).\n* Song 14: \"Yasad besodo\", discusses many different Kabbalistic concepts and how God created the world with his divine instruction.\n* Song 15: \"Eress Varom\", discusses the seven days of creation, using one stanza for each day.\n* Song 23: \"Ki Eshmerah Shabbat\", a well known song among all Jewish communities that was written by Rabbi [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]].\n* Song 28: \"Yom Zeh le-Yisrael\", a famous song written by [[Isaac Luria]].\n* Song 33: contains allusions to each of the four \"Amidah\" services recited on the Sabbath.\n\nThe baqashot are interrupted after Song 34 to sing [[Psalms|Psalm 92]], the Psalm of the Sabbath, one verse at a time, using a different [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] for each verse.  There are many other verses of the Psalms scattered throughout the different songs, called \"petihot\", to serve as markers. Unlike the baqashot themselves, these are rendered by the [[hazzan]] or by the elder people as a [[mawwal]] (non-rhythmical solo [[cadenza]]).\n\n* Song 35: \"Shalom Vassedek\" is a song written by Rabbi [[Shlomo Laniado]]. Each stanza ends with \"Shlomo\".\n* Song 38: \"Esah Libi\" contains allusions to each of the nineteen blessings in the daily \"[[Amidah]]\" prayer.\n* Song 39 and 40: two songs in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] by [[Israel Najara]].\n* Song 41: \"Ani Asaper\" discusses the laws of Sabbath (the 39 categories of \"work\").\n* Song 43: \"Mahalalah\" alludes to the [[Seven Heavens]] mentioned in the [[Kabbalah]].\n* Song 46: contains references to all the composers of the Baqashot.\n* Song 51: Halakhot of Shabbat.\n* Song 53: a song dedicated to R. [[Simeon bar Yohai|Shim'on bar Yohai]], reputed author of the [[Zohar]].\n* Song 61 and 62: \"[[Yedid Nefesh]]\" (written by Eleazar Azikri, and also used by Ashkenazim) and \"Agadelcha\" (written by [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]).\n\nThe Baqashot service concludes with [[Adon Olam]] (Song 66) followed by the ancient [[Kaddish]] prayer sung in the melody of the maqam for that specific Sabbath.\n\n==Composers in the Syrian Tradition==\n\nIncluded in most baqashot collections is a poem by [[Elazar ben Moshe Azikri|Elazar Azikri]] (1533\u20131600), a [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]] who lived in Safed. The poem \u201cYedid Nefesh\u201d, or \"Faithful Friend\", was one of several which were published in 1601 in Venice in his \u201cSefer Haredim\u201d. The collection also includes other famous poems of similar date, such as \"Yom Zeh Leyisrael\" by [[Isaac Luria]]. 8 of the roughly 66 Syrian ''baqashot'' were composed by [[Israel ben Moses Najara|Israel Najara]] including\"Yah Ribbon Alam,\" \"Yomar Na Yisrael,\" and \"Yodukha Ra'ayonay.\"  Other composers, from the twelfth to the nineteenth century, include Hakhamim: Abraham Maimon (student of the [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]] [[Moses Cordovero]]), Yosef Sutton, [[Solomon Ibn Gabirol]], Yaacob Abadi, Mordechai Labaton, Eliyahu Hamaoui, Ezra Attiah, [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] (who wrote \"Agadelcha\"), [[David Pardo (Italian rabbi)|David Pardo]], David Dayan, Shelomo Laniado (who wrote \"Shalom vatzedek\"), Yitzhak Benatar, Eliyahu Sasson, David Kassin, Shimeon Labi, Mordekhai Abadi and Shelomo Menaged. \n\nMore recent composers of ''baqashot'' from the Aleppo community are Refael Antebi Tabbush (1830<ref>According to the biography in [http://www.piyut.org.il/articles/303.html www.piyut.il] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806155417/http://www.piyut.org.il/articles/303.html |date=August 6, 2014 }} and the preface to ''Shirah \u1e24adashah'' (\"the Blue Book\").  ''La-qedoshim asher ba-are\"tz'' gives the date as 1856/7.</ref>-1919), the leading ''pizmonim'' composer, his pupil and foster son Moshe Ashear (Ashqar) and Ashear's pupil [[Chaim Shaul Abud]].\n\nSong 46, \"Yah Melech Ram\", alludes to the names of the Baqashot composers. \n\nLiving classical composer [[Yitzhak Yedid]] is known for his combining of baqashot with contemporary classical writing.\n\nAccording to Sephardic tradition, the Baqashot are unique in that many of the melodies were composed for pre-existing texts, unlike many more recent pizmonim where the words were composed to fit an existing, often non-Jewish, melody. It is also believed that many melodies of the Baqashot, unlike those of many pizmonim, are not borrowed from foreign sources.\n\n==Current practices==\n\nThe tradition of waking up before dawn and singing the Baqashot still survives today in [[Jerusalem]], in the [[Ades Synagogue]] in [[Nachlaot]] and the Moussaiof synagogue in the Bukharan quarter. The service is held only in the winter months, starting with the night of Shabbat [[Noach (parsha)|Noa\u1e25]] (the second Sabbath after [[Simchat Torah]]). [http://www.betyaakob.com The Edmond J. Safra Synagogue] of Brooklyn, New York also practices Baqashot every Shabbat under the leadership of Rabbi Mansour and several Hazzanim.\n\nIn communities throughout the world not so committed to the idea of waking up before dawn, the Baqashot melodies, or sometimes the actual songs, are still sung either in the course of the prayers or casually on certain occasions. But there are places there still practicing this tradition like Shaare Sion synagogue in Argentina\n\nIn some settings, the honor of singing the Kaddish goes to the highest bidder.\n\nRefreshments, such as tea or arrak, are often served during the services.\n\nThe Turkish ''maftirim'' tradition persists and is practised to this day in Istanbul.\n\nThe Moroccan ''baqashot'' in Israel are sung regularly in cities such as [[Ashdod]] and [[Ashkelon]] with large populations of Moroccan Jews. They are also sung occasionally in Moroccan diasporic centers such as [[Montreal]], Canada and [[Paris]], France.\n\n==Recordings==\n\nThere are multiple official and unofficial recordings of the Moroccan ''baqashot'' repertoire, including a set of 6 cds recorded by the late ''hazzan'' and ''paytan'' Rabbi Meir 'Atiyah.\n\n\"Ottoman Hebrew Sacred Songs\" contains a handful of ''maftirim'' recordings of Samuel Benaroya in his old age. This rare recording of one of the last surviving singers of the Maftirim choir of Edirne, Turkey.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ottoman Hebrew Sacred Songs |url=https://www.jewish-music.huji.ac.il/content/ottoman-hebrew-sacred-songs |website=Jewish Music Research Center |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nA more comprehensive set recordings of the Turkish ''maftirim'' was released in 2010 under the title \"Maftirim: Turkish-Sephardic Synagogue Hymns.\" David Behar, Hazan Isak Ma\u00e7oro, and Hazan David Sevi were recorded in the 1980s but the recordings were lost until the mid-2000s.

The recordings were made vocally; that is, without music instrumentation. They were recorded by three prominent community cantors: Isaac Cabasso, Mickey Kairey and Hyman Kairey. The project was organized by the Sephardic Archives, in association with the [http://www.scclive.org/ Sephardic Community Center] in Brooklyn, New York. \n\nDavid Betesh, coordinator of the [[Pizmonim#Sephardic Pizmonim Project|Sephardic Pizmonim Project]], more recently released the Baqashot from these recordings onto the project's website (link below) for the general Internet public.

It also influenced the Kabbalistically oriented confraternities in 18th-century Italy, and even became customary for a time in Sephardic communities in western Europe, such as Amsterdam and London.  (In Amsterdam the Shabbat service still begins with a small number of baqashot.  In London the tunes for one or two of them have been preserved in the literature but the practice no longer exists.)  By the turn of the 20th century Baqashot had become a widespread religious practice in several communities in Jerusalem as a communal form of prayer. \n\nIn communities such as those of [[Aleppo]], Turkey and Morocco, the singing of Baqashot expanded to vast proportions.  In those countries special books were compiled naming the tunes and [[Arabic maqam|maqam]]at together with the text of the hymns, in order to facilitate the singing of Baqashot by the congregation.  In these communities it was customary to rise from bed in the night on Shabbat in the winter months, when the nights are longer, and assemble in synagogue to sing Baqashot for four hours until the time for the morning service.\n\nEach country had its own collection of baqashot, and there is often little or no overlap between the collections of different countries.<ref> At least 4 baqashot are shared between the Moroccan and Syrian repertoires, namely \u05d9\u05d5\u05d3\u05d5\u05da \u05e8\u05e2\u05d9\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9, \u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05de\u05d9 \u05d4\u05e7\u05e9\u05d4\n \u05d0\u05e8\u05e5 \u05d5\u05e8\u05d5\u05dd, \u05e9\u05d7\u05e8 \u05d0\u05d1\u05e7\u05e9\u05da </ref> The Moroccan collection is known as \"Shir Yedidot\" (Marrakesh 1921): unlike in the Aleppo tradition, where the baqashot service is the same every shabbat, the Moroccan tradition has a different set of baqashot for each week.  The Amsterdam collection is set out in the first part of Joseph Gallego's ''Imre No'am'': the contents of this were probably derived from the Salonica tradition.\n\n== The Turkish Tradition ==\nThe equivalent tradition is known as \"Shirat Hamaftirim\", and the songs are performed by choirs of \"maftirim\".  The music and style of singing are based on [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[Ottoman classical music]].  This tradition flourished in Adrianople (present-day [[Edirne]]) in European Turkey, as well as in [[Salonica]] and [[Istanbul]] from the 17th century until the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nThe scholar Abraham Danon attested to the Edirne (Adrianople) maftirim tradition in this source from the late 1920s:<ref name=\"seroussi\">{{cite journal |last1=Seroussi |first1=Edwin |title=An Historical Overview of the Maftirim Phenomenon |date=2008}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The institution for which these songs were intended is the choir called Maftirim, who are the singers or assistant cantors. From ancient times this was the custom in Adrianople: each Sabbath morning, before the morning prayer (in recent times they shift to the time of the Sabbath eve), the Levite's disciples gathered at the Portugal synagogue (and sang with their throats songs to praise the Lord and afterwards each one walked to his synagogue (which were thirteen in number before the great fire) where the [opening] prayer ''Barukh she-amar'' did not start before the ending of the ''Qaddish'' by the Maftirim. In the course of time, the cantors joined with the Levite's assistants (''mezammerim'') and sang together songs to the joy of the listeners gathered around them who were avid for the songs and they opened their mouths as if they wanted to swallow rain. This is the reason the majority of the [Jewish] inhabitants of Adrianople had some expertise in the art of song, because since their youth they were educated on the laps [of music]. I heard that the refugees who flew from that city due to the War moved to Constantinople where they reestablished the gathering of the Maftirim at the Galata quarter...}}\n\nIn both [[Edirne]] and [[Salonica]], the ''maftirim'' would sing a [[fas\u0131l]] for each Shabbat in a different [[makam]].<ref name=\"seroussi\"></ref> The ''maftirim'' would begin with a prayer in Aramaic ''Beresh ormanuta,'' followed by vocal improvisations of Biblical verses. Finally, the service would end with ''Mizmor shir leyom hashabbat'' and ''Qaddish''.\n\nThe definitive edition of ''baqashot'' and ''piyyutim'' in the Ottoman-Turkish tradition was published in 1926 by Eliyahu Navon with the help of the Hazzan Avraham Behor Papo.

Later composers from the 18th century include Rabbi Yaaqob ibn Sur[https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A8] (1673-1753) and [[David Ben Hassin|R' David Ben Hassin]] (1727-1795), one of the most prolific Jewish Moroccan poets.\n\nAlthough the ''baqashot'' are organized by [[Weekly Torah Portion|the weekly Torah portions]], the themes of the ''piyyutim'' range from [[Shabbat]] and Jewish holidays such as [[Purim]], to [[Zion]] and [[Kabbalah]]. Some of the ''piyyutim'' are in [[Judeo-Arabic]]. As a whole, the Moroccan ''baqashot'' represent close to 8 centuries of Sephardic poetry and music.\n\nOne of the first printed collections of Andalusian ''baqashot'' was arranged by Rabbi Abraham Elmaliah from Mogador in 1856 under the name ''Soba' Semahot'' (\u05e9\u05d5\u05d1\u05e2 \u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05ea). This was a collection of all the \"old\" (\u05dc\u05e7\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd) manuscripts of ''baqashot'' and ''piyyutim,'' as well as original compositions.<ref name=\"shiryedidot\"></ref> Another collection ''Roni VeSimhi'' (\u05e8\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d5\u05e9\u05de\u05d7\u05d9)  was published in 1890 by Rabbi David Yefalah, also from Mogador, with many additional ''piyyutim'' assembled from manuscripts.\n\nIn 1921, a group of prominent Moroccan ''hazzanim'' standardized the structure of the ''baqashot'' into its modern form. These included Rabbi David Yefalah, R' David Elqayim, and R' David Afriat, all from [[Essaouira]], and R' Hayyim Atar from [[Marrakesh]].<ref name=\"shiryedidot\"></ref> The first volume containing older ''piyyutim'' was called ''Shir Yedidot,'' while the second volume containing newer compositions was called ''Keter Kehuna.'' Many editions of Shir Yedidot were subsequently published in 1931, 1979, and more recently in 1999.\n\n==The Syrian tradition==\n\nIn Aleppo, Syria this custom seems to go back about 500 years. Most of the community would arise at 3:00AM to sing Baqashot and to listen to the voices of the Hazanim, Paytanim, and Meshorerim. When they arrived at Mizmor Shir LeYom HaShabbat they would break to listen to a sermon by one of the Rabbis who discussed the Parashah of the week. When he concluded they would begin Mizmor Shir LeYom HaShabbat and sing all the rest of the Baqashot.\n\nThe Syrian tradition was introduced to Jerusalem by Raphael Altaras, who came to that city from Aleppo in 1845 and founded a Baqashot circle at the ''Kehal Tsiyon'' synagogue.  In this way the custom of Baqashot became part of the mainstream Jerusalem Sephardic tradition.  Another important influence was Jacob Ades (1857\u20131925), who immigrated to Jerusalem in 1895 and introduced the tradition to the Persian and Bukharan communities.  The main centre of the tradition today is the [[Ades Synagogue]] in [[Nachlaot]], where the leading spirit was [[rabbi]] [[Chaim Shaul Abud]].\n\nThe Aleppian Baqashot did not only reach Jerusalem. The Jews of Aleppo took this custom with them wherever they went: to Turkey, Cairo, Mexico, Argentina and Brooklyn, New York.\nEach of these communities preserved this custom in the original Halabi style without all the changes and embellishments that have been added to the Baqashot by Jerusalem cantors over the years. Though these communities do not perform the Baqashot on a weekly basis, nevertheless, they use the melodies of the Baqashot throughout Saturday morning prayers.\n\n==Themes in the Syrian Tradition==\n\nThere is a total of 66 songs in the Syrian Baqashot book, and the collection is now regarded as closed, unlike the general body of [[pizmonim]], where new pizmonim are still composed for special occasions.  Each song is shown with its maqam, but they follow a fixed order of recitation which does not depend on the maqamat of the different songs. There are many sections within the Baqashot. The sections are separated by different Biblical verses to be chanted in a different maqam. \n\nThe songs principally consist of the praise of God, songs for Shabbat, songs of longing for the Holy Land and so on, and include some [[Piyut|piyyutim]] taken from the main body of the prayer book. These songs are considered more ancient and sacred than other [[pizmonim]] (Hebrew songs).  Many of the songs contain acrostics identifying the author of that specific composition. \n\nBaqashot are full of mystical allusions and traditions. Some of the songs contain references to some of the most sacred Jewish traditions. The following are examples of thematic songs:\n* Song 1 and 34: listing of the 10 \"[[Sefirot]]\" (attributes) in the [[Kabbalah]].\n* Song 2: refers to the return to Zion in the time of redemption.\n* Song 6 and 7: a song with each stanza ending with \"boqer\" (morning).\n* Song 9: a song with each stanza ending with \"yom\" (day).\n* Song 14: \"Yasad besodo\", discusses many different Kabbalistic concepts and how God created the world with his divine instruction.\n* Song 15: \"Eress Varom\", discusses the seven days of creation, using one stanza for each day.\n* Song 23: \"Ki Eshmerah Shabbat\", a well known song among all Jewish communities that was written by Rabbi [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]].\n* Song 28: \"Yom Zeh le-Yisrael\", a famous song written by [[Isaac Luria]].\n* Song 33: contains allusions to each of the four \"Amidah\" services recited on the Sabbath.\n\nThe baqashot are interrupted after Song 34 to sing [[Psalms|Psalm 92]], the Psalm of the Sabbath, one verse at a time, using a different [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] for each verse.  There are many other verses of the Psalms scattered throughout the different songs, called \"petihot\", to serve as markers. Unlike the baqashot themselves, these are rendered by the [[hazzan]] or by the elder people as a [[mawwal]] (non-rhythmical solo [[cadenza]]).\n\n* Song 35: \"Shalom Vassedek\" is a song written by Rabbi [[Shlomo Laniado]]. Each stanza ends with \"Shlomo\".\n* Song 38: \"Esah Libi\" contains allusions to each of the nineteen blessings in the daily \"[[Amidah]]\" prayer.\n* Song 39 and 40: two songs in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] by [[Israel Najara]].\n* Song 41: \"Ani Asaper\" discusses the laws of Sabbath (the 39 categories of \"work\").\n* Song 43: \"Mahalalah\" alludes to the [[Seven Heavens]] mentioned in the [[Kabbalah]].\n* Song 46: contains references to all the composers of the Baqashot.\n* Song 51: Halakhot of Shabbat.\n* Song 53: a song dedicated to R. [[Simeon bar Yohai|Shim'on bar Yohai]], reputed author of the [[Zohar]].\n* Song 61 and 62: \"[[Yedid Nefesh]]\" (written by Eleazar Azikri, and also used by Ashkenazim) and \"Agadelcha\" (written by [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]).\n\nThe Baqashot service concludes with [[Adon Olam]] (Song 66) followed by the ancient [[Kaddish]] prayer sung in the melody of the maqam for that specific Sabbath.\n\n==Composers in the Syrian Tradition==\n\nIncluded in most baqashot collections is a poem by [[Elazar ben Moshe Azikri|Elazar Azikri]] (1533\u20131600), a [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]] who lived in Safed. The poem \u201cYedid Nefesh\u201d, or \"Faithful Friend\", was one of several which were published in 1601 in Venice in his \u201cSefer Haredim\u201d. The collection also includes other famous poems of similar date, such as \"Yom Zeh Leyisrael\" by [[Isaac Luria]]. 8 of the roughly 66 Syrian ''baqashot'' were composed by [[Israel ben Moses Najara|Israel Najara]] including\"Yah Ribbon Alam,\" \"Yomar Na Yisrael,\" and \"Yodukha Ra'ayonay.\"  Other composers, from the twelfth to the nineteenth century, include Hakhamim: Abraham Maimon (student of the [[Kabbalah|kabbalist]] [[Moses Cordovero]]), Yosef Sutton, [[Solomon Ibn Gabirol]], Yaacob Abadi, Mordechai Labaton, Eliyahu Hamaoui, Ezra Attiah, [[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] (who wrote \"Agadelcha\"), [[David Pardo (Italian rabbi)|David Pardo]], David Dayan, Shelomo Laniado (who wrote \"Shalom vatzedek\"), Yitzhak Benatar, Eliyahu Sasson, David Kassin, Shimeon Labi, Mordekhai Abadi and Shelomo Menaged. \n\nMore recent composers of ''baqashot'' from the Aleppo community are Refael Antebi Tabbush (1830<ref>According to the biography in [http://www.piyut.org.il/articles/303.html www.piyut.il] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806155417/http://www.piyut.org.il/articles/303.html |date=August 6, 2014 }} and the preface to ''Shirah \u1e24adashah'' (\"the Blue Book\").  ''La-qedoshim asher ba-are\"tz'' gives the date as 1856/7.</ref>-1919), the leading ''pizmonim'' composer, his pupil and foster son Moshe Ashear (Ashqar) and Ashear's pupil [[Chaim Shaul Abud]].\n\nSong 46, \"Yah Melech Ram\", alludes to the names of the Baqashot composers. \n\nLiving classical composer [[Yitzhak Yedid]] is known for his combining of baqashot with contemporary classical writing.\n\nAccording to Sephardic tradition, the Baqashot are unique in that many of the melodies were composed for pre-existing texts, unlike many more recent pizmonim where the words were composed to fit an existing, often non-Jewish, melody. It is also believed that many melodies of the Baqashot, unlike those of many pizmonim, are not borrowed from foreign sources.\n\n==Current practices==\n\nThe tradition of waking up before dawn and singing the Baqashot still survives today in [[Jerusalem]], in the [[Ades Synagogue]] in [[Nachlaot]] and the Moussaiof synagogue in the Bukharan quarter. The service is held only in the winter months, starting with the night of Shabbat [[Noach (parsha)|Noa\u1e25]] (the second Sabbath after [[Simchat Torah]]). [http://www.betyaakob.com The Edmond J. Safra Synagogue] of Brooklyn, New York also practices Baqashot every Shabbat under the leadership of Rabbi Mansour and several Hazzanim.\n\nIn communities throughout the world not so committed to the idea of waking up before dawn, the Baqashot melodies, or sometimes the actual songs, are still sung either in the course of the prayers or casually on certain occasions. But there are places there still practicing this tradition like Shaare Sion synagogue in Argentina\n\nIn some settings, the honor of singing the Kaddish goes to the highest bidder.\n\nRefreshments, such as tea or arrak, are often served during the services.\n\nThe Turkish ''maftirim'' tradition persists and is practised to this day in Istanbul.\n\nThe Moroccan ''baqashot'' in Israel are sung regularly in cities such as [[Ashdod]] and [[Ashkelon]] with large populations of Moroccan Jews. They are also sung occasionally in Moroccan diasporic centers such as [[Montreal]], Canada and [[Paris]], France.\n\n==Recordings==\n\nThere are multiple official and unofficial recordings of the Moroccan ''baqashot'' repertoire, including a set of 6 cds recorded by the late ''hazzan'' and ''paytan'' Rabbi Meir 'Atiyah.\n\n\"Ottoman Hebrew Sacred Songs\" contains a handful of ''maftirim'' recordings of Samuel Benaroya in his old age. This rare recording of one of the last surviving singers of the Maftirim choir of Edirne, Turkey.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ottoman Hebrew Sacred Songs |url=https://www.jewish-music.huji.ac.il/content/ottoman-hebrew-sacred-songs |website=Jewish Music Research Center |accessdate=31 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nA more comprehensive set recordings of the Turkish ''maftirim'' was released in 2010 under the title \"Maftirim: Turkish-Sephardic Synagogue Hymns.\" David Behar, Hazan Isak Ma\u00e7oro, and Hazan David Sevi were recorded in the 1980s but the recordings were lost until the mid-2000s.

The recordings were made vocally; that is, without music instrumentation. They were recorded by three prominent community cantors: Isaac Cabasso, Mickey Kairey and Hyman Kairey. The project was organized by the Sephardic Archives, in association with the [http://www.scclive.org/ Sephardic Community Center] in Brooklyn, New York. \n\nDavid Betesh, coordinator of the [[Pizmonim#Sephardic Pizmonim Project|Sephardic Pizmonim Project]], more recently released the Baqashot from these recordings onto the project's website (link below) for the general Internet public.

While the USAF has released few details on the UAV's design or capabilities, defense analysts believe that it is a [[stealth aircraft]] fitted with [[aerial reconnaissance]] equipment. More images and details on the aircraft were released after [[Iran\u2013U.S. RQ-170 incident|Iran captured]] a RQ-170 in 2011. \n\n==Development==\nThe RQ-170 Sentinel was developed by Lockheed Martin's [[Skunk Works]] as a [[Stealth aircraft|stealth]] unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

Seven miles below sea level, a strong earthquake suddenly struck and destroyed parts of the facility. Due to a night shift schedule, Mechanical engineer Norah Price and her colleague, Rodrigo Nagenda, are awake during the emergency, able to escape but at the expense of sacrificing the East Wing Habitat to save the rest of the facility, killing all the crew left inside. Finding a potential evac pod in CR-7, the two make their way through the debris, rescuing fellow colleague, Paul Abel, under the rubble along the way. Together, they reach the escape pod bay. However, they discover that all of the escape pods and the submersibles have already been deployed, with Captain Lucien the only person left in the area, and reports most of the crew are dead.\n\nThey reach the main control base and find biologist, Emily Haversham, and operations engineer, Liam Smith, unsuccessfully attempt to make contact with the surface. Smith then plays an audiotape in which a crew member is attacked, followed by a low hypersonic groan seconds before the tape ends, which unsettles everyone. With the damaged thermal cores potentially causing a nuclear meltdown, Lucien devices using their pressurized suits to walk one mile down and one mile across the ocean floor to Roebuck 641 in the hopes of resurfacing from there. As they descend for the freight elevator, Rodrigo\u2019s defective helmet instantly implodes under the rapid water pressure change, killing him. The surviving crew sees a distress beacon from one of the escape pods below, and Smith and Paul go to investigate. As they arrive at the location, they find the pod covered in a translucent, algae-like membrane and a body in the rubble. A small creature, feasting on the corpse, emerges and attacks the two. Smith kills the creature and takes it inside the station. Haversham examines the creature and realizes that it belongs to a previously undiscovered species. They are suddenly interrupted by loud noises crawling around the freight station, and a strange tentacle-like creature watches them from outside the window.\n\nThe thermal core finally deteriorates and the entire Kepler facility explodes, causing the freight elevator's cables to snap. Left with no choice, the five free-falls to the bottom. They run toward the nearby access tunnels, avoiding the falling debris, but Smith is hit, saved just in time by Captain Lucien. Price and Havesham see multiple shadowy creatures watching them from afar. After reaching the access tunnels, they find that Smith's oxygen scrubber is badly damaged by the debris and will cause him to suffocate on the toxic fumes. They realize the creatures are actively hunting them, following above the tunnels. Halfway through the access tunnel, they find that their only way out is through a section submerged underwater. Paul, the last to swim to the other side, is suddenly attacked by an unknown creature, which cuts him in half, and drags him underwater. At Midway Station, they witness the entire trench ripped open, exposing a massive cavern. Haversham surmises that they drilled too deep and penetrated a thermal pocket where the creatures may have come from, pondering if this is humanity's punishment for their greed. The four set off again across the ocean floor, but a humanoid creature appears and drags Smith into a cave. Lucien manages to get Smith out but is himself pulled from the others, dragging Price along with him. The creature appears and attacks Price, but Lucien stabs it, which in turn causes the creature to grab him and swims higher. Lucien sacrifices himself to spare Price from the increasing pressure change and implodes, killing the creature with him.\n\nPrice ends up at the abandoned Shepard Drill Station, and racked with grief, guilt, and feeling powerless, decides to keep moving, encouraging her to repair her damaged suit and arms herself with flare guns & drilling tools before continuing toward Roebuck. Walking along the ocean floor, she reunites with Haversham and an injured Smith. As they enter Roebuck, they encounter a nest of the humanoid creatures hanging from the ceiling and try to sneak by, but the sound of Haversham's oxygen alarm wakes the creatures. Price is partially swallowed by one of the creatures but is able to kill it with a flare gun and frees herself. Price then sees multiple creatures waking up on the ceiling, but she quickly notices that it was moving. As she fires another flare, it reveals the cosmic entity, [[Cthulhu]], a colossal, towering deity to which the smaller ones attach themselves to its body.

Seven miles below sea level, a strong earthquake suddenly struck and destroyed parts of the facility. Due to a night shift schedule, Mechanical engineer Norah Price and her colleague, Rodrigo Nagenda, are awake during the emergency, able to escape but at the expense of sacrificing the East Wing Habitat to save the rest of the facility, killing all the crew left inside. Finding a potential evac pod in CR-7, the two make their way through the debris, rescuing fellow colleague, Paul Abel, under the rubble along the way. Together, they reach the escape pod bay. However, they discover that all of the escape pods and the submersibles have already been deployed, with Captain Lucien the only person left in the area, and reports most of the crew are dead.\n\nThey reach the main control base and find biologist, Emily Haversham, and operations engineer, Liam Smith, unsuccessfully attempt to make contact with the surface. Smith then plays an audiotape in which a crew member is attacked, followed by a low hypersonic groan seconds before the tape ends, which unsettles everyone. With the damaged thermal cores potentially causing a nuclear meltdown, Lucien devices using their pressurized suits to walk one mile down and one mile across the ocean floor to Roebuck 641 in the hopes of resurfacing from there. As they descend for the freight elevator, Rodrigo\u2019s defective helmet instantly implodes under the rapid water pressure change, killing him. The surviving crew sees a distress beacon from one of the escape pods below, and Smith and Paul go to investigate. As they arrive at the location, they find the pod covered in a translucent, algae-like membrane and a body in the rubble. A small creature, feasting on the corpse, emerges and attacks the two. Smith kills the creature and takes it inside the station. Haversham examines the creature and realizes that it belongs to a previously undiscovered species. They are suddenly interrupted by loud noises crawling around the freight station, and a strange tentacle-like creature watches them from outside the window.\n\nThe thermal core finally deteriorates and the entire Kepler facility explodes, causing the freight elevator's cables to snap. Left with no choice, the five free-falls to the bottom. They run toward the nearby access tunnels, avoiding the falling debris, but Smith is hit, saved just in time by Captain Lucien. Price and Havesham see multiple shadowy creatures watching them from afar. After reaching the access tunnels, they find that Smith's oxygen scrubber is badly damaged by the debris and will cause him to suffocate on the toxic fumes. They realize the creatures are actively hunting them, following above the tunnels. Halfway through the access tunnel, they find that their only way out is through a section submerged underwater. Paul, the last to swim to the other side, is suddenly attacked by an unknown creature, which cuts him in half, and drags him underwater. At Midway Station, they witness the entire trench ripped open, exposing a massive cavern. Haversham surmises that they drilled too deep and penetrated a thermal pocket where the creatures may have come from, pondering if this is humanity's punishment for their greed. The four set off again across the ocean floor, but a humanoid creature appears and drags Smith into a cave. Lucien manages to get Smith out but is himself pulled from the others, dragging Price along with him. The creature appears and attacks Price, but Lucien stabs it, which in turn causes the creature to grab him and swims higher. Lucien sacrifices himself to spare Price from the increasing pressure change and implodes, killing the creature with him.\n\nPrice ends up at the abandoned Shepard Drill Station, and racked with grief, guilt, and feeling powerless, decides to keep moving, encouraging her to repair her damaged suit and arms herself with flare guns & drilling tools before continuing toward Roebuck. Walking along the ocean floor, she reunites with Haversham and an injured Smith. As they enter Roebuck, they encounter a nest of the humanoid creatures hanging from the ceiling and try to sneak by, but the sound of Haversham's oxygen alarm wakes the creatures. Price is partially swallowed by one of the creatures but is able to kill it with a flare gun and frees herself. Price then sees multiple creatures waking up on the ceiling, but she quickly notices that it was moving. As she fires another flare, it reveals the cosmic entity, [[Cthulhu]], a colossal, towering deity to which the smaller ones attach themselves to its body. A horrified Price quickly flees and reunites with Smith and Haversham. Cthulhu sees them and attacks, deliberately trapping them in the middle of the station. Price, Haversham, and Smith manage to get to the pod bay, but Price finds out that only 2 of the 3 pods work. Realizing one has to stay behind, Price accepts her fate and lies to the others, forcing Smith and Haversham into their respective pods and sacrifices herself. Cthulhu releases the smaller creatures after the pods, and Price overloads the core of the Roebuck, resulting in a massive explosion that kills her and the creatures.\n\nDuring the credits, news reports show that Smith and Haversham escaped to the surface.
