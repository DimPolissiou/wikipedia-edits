The company was established in 1874 and started with [[horsecar]] operations on the [[Ullev\u00e5l Hageby Line]], [[Gamlebyen Line]] and the [[Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka\u2013Torshov Line]]. The network was electrified with in 1899 and 1900, whereby the company was bought by [[Union-Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft]]. It delivered new [[KES and KSS Class U|Class U]] trams. Within a few years the company had also opened the [[V\u00e5lerenga Line]] and [[Kampen Line]]. It took over [[Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie]] in 1905, taking over its fleet of [[KKS Class S|Class S]] trams and the [[Sagene Ring]], the [[Vippetangen Line]] and the [[Rodel\u00f8kka Line]].\n\nThe company was based at [[Homansbyen Depot]]. From 1912 it started an extensive cooperation with its main competitor, [[Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei]] (KES). KSS also took delivery of the [[KES and KKS Class SS|Class SS]] trams and from 1921 the [[KSS Class H|Class H]] trams. The company build part of the [[Sinsen Line]] in 1923. Both companies were [[municipalization|municipalized]] in 1924 to become [[Oslo Sporveier]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment===\n[[File:KSS horsecars Karl Johans gate.jpg|thumb|Horsecars in [[Karl Johans gate]] in 1898]]\nThe first plans for horsecar operations in Oslo\u2014then known as Christiania\u2014took place in 1868, when Engineer [[Jens Theodor Pauldan Vogt]] and Architect [[Paul Due]] applied for a [[concession (contract)|concession]]. They proposed a line from [[Homansbyen]] to [[Gamlebyen]] (then known as Oslo) with branches to [[Pipervika]] and Palaisbryggen. The municipal authorities rejected the application\u2014citing concerns of the street being too narrow. A new application was issued in 1873 with a common section with four branches, along Drammensveien, Gamlebyen, [[Oslo West Station]] (Vestbanen) and [[Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka]]. This time the municipality granted the necessary permissions.<ref name=hestesporvogn>{{cite journal |title=Hestesporvognsdriften i Kristiania |last=Johannessen |first=Terje |last2=Andersen |first2=Bj\u00f8rn |year=2013 |volume=83 |pages=6\u201331 |journal=[[Lokaltrafikk]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nVogt and Due's concession was transferred to a company, A/S Kristiania Sporveisselskab, which was incorporated on 26 August 1874. The share capital was set to 200,000 [[Norwegian speciedaler|speciedaler]].<ref>Fasting: 9</ref> The company bought a lot on [[Pilestredet]] 10,000 speciedaler, which became the site of [[Homansbyen Depot]], including the company's administration. In its original design it had places for 44 vehicles and 116 horses, as well as a smithy, offices, apartments, a laboratory for the veterinary and a sick bay for twelve horses.<ref name=\"Fristad: 19\">Fristad: 19</ref> The company was permitted to use tracks on top of the roads, although the municipality retained the right at any time to require them to be dug down. The company opted for [[standard gauge]], presumably because this was most common amongst horsecars and eased procurement. Track-laying started in May 1875.<ref name=hestesporvogn /> Because of the location of the depot and the low traffic estimates along Drammensveien, KSS opted to instead build a branch to Homansbyen.<ref>Fasting: 12</ref>\n\n[[File:KSS horsecars 1876.jpg|thumb|left|Horsecars outside [[Oslo Cathedral]] in 1876]]\nThe first twenty-two trams arrived from [[John Stephenson Company]] on 2 September 1875. The first horses arrived nine days later. Trial runs started on 21 September and operating permit was granted on 4 October. The official opening took place the following day. Regular traffic started on 6 October, as the second horsecar system in the Nordic Countries, after [[Copenhagen]]. The original network consisted of three services: from Homansbyen to [[Stortorvet (station)|Stortorvet]], from Vestbanen to Stortorvet and from Stortorvet to Oslo. The services to Vestbanen corresponded with trains, while the other two operated every ten minutes. The fares were set to 10 \u00f8re. Shortly after a direct service was set up from Homansbyen to Vestbanen.<ref name=hestesporvogn />\n\n===Horsecar operations===\nOslo was at the time a highly segregated community with little interaction between the higher and lower classes. Amongst the concerns of the upper classes was that the trams would become popular with the lower classes and that there would be more interaction between classes.<ref>Fristad: 12</ref> At first there were no regular stops, the horsecar would simply lower its speed and allow people to jump on and off where they wished. This was especially important on hills to keep the momentum and not wear out the horses. The horsecar would stop for elderly passengers and those of sufficient prominence.<ref name=hestesporvogn /> The company took delivery of seventeen sleds for use during winter. These proved much less suitable for operations, as the horses could not pull the same load on snow as on rails. The turnover time for horses was reduced, resulting in increased [[headway]]. The company therefore decided to salt and plow the tracks and instead use the horsecars during winter.<ref name=fr21>Fristad: 21</ref>\n\n[[File:KSS horsecar 1880.jpg|thumb|Horsecar in 1880]]\nProfits were made immediately, and in 1877 an additional seven cars were delivered,<ref name=a6>Aspenberg: 6</ref> allowing the headway to drop to five minutes.<ref name=\"Fristad: 19\"/> The company became a major retailer of used horses. These were sought after due to the good treatment they received at the company. However, if they ever walked down a street with tracks they would follow these blindly and it was difficult to get them to diverge off the route.<ref>Fristad: 20</ref> From 1878, the fare increased to 15 \u00f8re for all routes.<ref>Fristad: 15</ref> KSS opened its first extension on 18 March 1878, when the first part of the [[Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka\u2013Torshov Line]] opened from Storgata to Thorvald Meyers gate. It was further extended to Beyer Bridge on 12 April 1879.<ref name=\"fr138\"/> In conjunction with this a new depot was built at Olaf Ryes plass with place for fifty horses and a number of horsecars.<ref name=fr21 /> The Vestbanen Line was extended to Munkedamsveien on 5 May 1879.<ref name=a6 />\n\nOnce these expansions were made the company fell more into a state of operation. From 9 July 1880 all routes terminating at Stortorvet were merged, resulting in direct services from Homansbyen to Oslo and from Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka to Vestbanen. This also meant that passengers no longer had to buy a new ticket for a transfer.<ref name=hestesporvogn /> Between 1887 and 1892 the company took delivery of seventeen new vehicles from [[Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk|Skabo]].<ref name=fr21 /> During the 1890s the company carried out some [[double track]]ing.<ref name=hestesporvogn /> The final batch of fifteen horsecars, built by [[Falkenried]], were delivered in 1897. They were so heavy they needed to be hauled by two horses and were designed with the intension of being used as trailers for the electric trams.<ref>Fristad: 33</ref>\n\n[[File:Opening of electric traction to Munkedamsveien.jpg|thumb|left|Opening of the electrification of the [[Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka\u2013Torshov Line]] on 29 September 1899.]]\n\n===Electrification===\n[[Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei]] (KES) became the second tramway operator in Oslo when it opened its first two electric tramway lines on 2 March 1893.<ref>Aspenberg: 7</ref> Although the new company received a permit for two new lines, KSS retained a preferential treatment allowing priority in building later new lines.<ref name=f42>Fasting: 42</ref> KES had significantly lower operating costs and only charged 10 \u00f8re for its tickets. Although only very few locations had a choice between the two companies, KSS was soon viewed as outdated and expensive.<ref name=fr62>Fristad: 62</ref> They chose to cut their ticket prices to 10 \u00f8re in 1896.<ref>Fristad: 27</ref>\n\nTo alleviate the situation, KSS's board approved plans in December 1897 for electrify their network. Meanwhile, the board decided to convert its entire network to double track. As tracks for an electric tramway had to be designed to allow for return current, an all-new trackage would have to be laid. These plans were approved by the annual meeting on 17 January 1898. The company both needed a supplier and capital, and struck a deal with [[Union-Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft]], who would deliver the new infrastructures and trams, and also provided capital through purchasing a majority stake in the company. There was a general understanding for the conversion in the public, although there were many protests against installing [[overhead line]]s in [[Karl Johans gate]].<ref name=hestesporvogn />\n\n[[File:KSS Class U tram and horsecar trailer.jpg|thumb|Class U tram hauling a converted horsecar trailer at [[Homansbyen Depot]] in 1905]]\nThe first section which was electrified was from Munkedamsveien to Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka, on 29 September 1899.<ref name=a10>Aspenberg: 10</ref> The same day the line was extended to [[Torshov (station)|Torshov]].<ref>Fristad: 34</ref> The Homansbyen and Oslo Lines were electrified on 17 November,<ref name=fr137>Fristad: 137</ref> except for the section from [[Oslo Hospital (station)|Oslo Hospital]] to [[St Halvards plass (station)|St Halvards plass]], which had to be hauled by horses until 15 January 1900.<ref>Fristad: 35</ref> This work required the delivery of new electrical trams. Forty-seven [[KES and KSS Class U|Class U]] units were delivered in 1899, with electrical equipment from Union and bodies built by Falkenried and [[Linke-Hofmann-Busch]]. Thirty-eight horsecars were converted to trailers.<ref name=a45>Aspenberg: 45</ref>\n\nThe company continued the work by opening the [[V\u00e5lerenga Line]] on 3 May.<ref name=fr137 /> The [[Kampen Line]] opened on 6 June. Both of these were branches of the Gamlebyen Line.<ref name=fr138>Fristad: 138</ref> This resulted in a major restructuring of the routes, with five lines each running on a ten-minute headway. The Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka\u2013Torshov Line was the next to be expanded. Unlike the rest, it was financed by the municipalities of Kristiania and [[Aker, Norway|Aker]], and was the first of KSS's lines to run outside the Kristiania's municipal borders.<ref>Fristad: 37</ref> It opened in two stages, to Sandaker on 2 October 1901 to [[Grefsen Station]] on 28 November 1902.<ref name=fr138 />\n\n[[File:KSS type S 1915.jpg|thumb|left|A converted [[KKS Class S|Class S]] tram in 1915, inherited from KKS]]\n\n===Consolidation===\nBy 1897 the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] had received a majority in the municipal council.

KSS applied to build a tramway there, but on 23 September 1897 the municipal council voted to establish its own tram company, [[Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie]] (KKS), and build a line to St. Hanshaugen Sagene itself.<ref name=f52>Fasting: 52</ref> This resulted in three new lines. [[Sagene Ring]] opened in November 1899.<ref>Faster: 56</ref><ref>Fristad: 45</ref> The [[Rodel\u00f8kka Line]], which opened in January 1900, used the lower section of the Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka Line to reach the city center. The [[Vippetangen Line]] was completed in August. However, none of the three lines connected with each other and KKS had to lease track from KSS.<ref>Fasting: 58</ref>\n\nKSS had a [[concession (contract)|concession]] which expired in 1905, at which time the municipality could purchase the company at par value. This raised a new debate concerning public or private operations, with many Conservative politicians calling for the privatization of KKS.<ref>Fasting: 64</ref> In the 1904 municipal election the issue was raised, with the Liberal Party and the socialist parties running for municipalization of tram operations. Meanwhile, the municipal administration worked with estimates for taking over KSS. A take-over would cost the municipality about NOK&nbsp;2 million, while a sale would bring in about NOK&nbsp;1.6 million. However, as KSS was a profitable company, it was estimated that the municipality would make more money by taking over KSS than selling KKS, estimated at about NOK&nbsp;3 million for the period in question. The decisive municipal council meeting was held on 14 April 1905, although the actual vote did not occur until 02:00 hours the following day, after a nine-hour debate.<ref>Fasting: 65</ref> The Conservative majority voted in favor of selling KKS to KSS and extending the latter's concession to 1924.<ref>Fasting: 66</ref>\n\n[[File:KSS tram 221.jpg|thumb|Tram hauling open Skabo trailer outside [[Sagene Church]] on [[Sagene Ring]]]]\nWith the takeover KSS required not only three lines, but also a fleet of twenty [[KKS Class S|Class S]] motorized trams and twelve trailers.<ref name=\"a45\"/> It also took over two depots.

KES had done this a few months earlier and taken the first three digits, so KSS numbered their lines 4 through 10.<ref>Fristad: 51</ref> From 1912 the two companies started to cooperate closely with their routes. This first materialized in a connecting line in Hegdehaugsveien, which allowed trams to run from Stortorvet via the Homansbyen Line to reach the [[Briskeby Line]] and [[Majorstuen (station)|Majorstuen]]. At Skillebekk a connection was built through Munkedamsveien, allowing the Vestbanen Line access to the [[Sk\u00f8yen Line]]. The third connection opened in 1915, linking Jernbanetorget to the [[Kampen Line]] and the [[V\u00e5lerenga Line]] through a connection along Vognmannsgata, Brugata and Vaterland Bridge, allowing trams from there to serve [[Oslo East Station]].<ref name=fr52>Fristad: 52</ref>\n\n[[File:KSS Brill tram.jpg|thumb|left|The one tram built by [[J.

At this point the municipality was free to purchase the companies at par value. A municipal committee was appointed in 1922 to look into the matter. KES was valuated at NOK&nbsp;9 million, while KSS was worth NOK&nbsp;12.5 million. The committees majority proposed a merger and that KSS received a prolonged concession, while the minority recommended that the tramways be bought by the city. A third option, a jointly public and privately owned company, was also proposed, where the municipality would own fifty-one percent.<ref name=f91>Fasting: 91</ref>\n\nThe issue was considered by the council's executive board, which supported the joint public\u2013private proposal with eleven against nine votes. The argumentation was largely ideological: the left side accused the right for bringing economic advantages for private investors, while the right accused the left of insufficient financial investigations of municipal operations.<ref name=f91 /> The issue was voted on in the municipal council in December, with 43 against 41 councillors supporting the joint model. The latter were members of the [[Communist Party of Norway|Communist Party]] and the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labor Party]], who both were in favor of a municipal take-over. The new company, Kristiania Sporveier, was incorporated in May 1924 and took over all street tram operations.

The company was established in 1874 and started with [[horsecar]] operations on the [[Ullev\u00e5l Hageby Line]], [[Gamlebyen Line]] and the [[Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka\u2013Torshov Line]]. The network was electrified with in 1899 and 1900, whereby the company was bought by [[Union-Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft]]. It delivered new [[KES and KSS Class U|Class U]] trams. Within a few years the company had also opened the [[V\u00e5lerenga Line]] and [[Kampen Line]]. It took over [[Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie]] in 1905, taking over its fleet of [[KKS Class S|Class S]] trams and the [[Sagene Ring]], the [[Vippetangen Line]] and the [[Rodel\u00f8kka Line]].\n\nThe company was based at [[Homansbyen Depot]]. From 1912 it started an extensive cooperation with its main competitor, [[Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei]] (KES). KSS also took delivery of the [[KES and KKS Class SS|Class SS]] trams and from 1921 the [[KSS Class H|Class H]] trams. The company build part of the [[Sinsen Line]] in 1923. Both companies were [[municipalization|municipalized]] in 1924 to become [[Oslo Sporveier]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment===\n[[File:KSS horsecars Karl Johans gate.jpg|thumb|Horsecars in [[Karl Johans gate]] in 1898]]\nThe first plans for horsecar operations in Oslo\u2014then known as Christiania\u2014took place in 1868, when Engineer [[Jens Theodor Pauldan Vogt]] and Architect [[Paul Due]] applied for a [[concession (contract)|concession]]. They proposed a line from [[Homansbyen]] to [[Gamlebyen]] (then known as Oslo) with branches to [[Pipervika]] and Palaisbryggen. The municipal authorities rejected the application\u2014citing concerns of the street being too narrow. A new application was issued in 1873 with a common section with four branches, along Drammensveien, Gamlebyen, [[Oslo West Station]] (Vestbanen) and [[Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka]]. This time the municipality granted the necessary permissions.<ref name=hestesporvogn>{{cite journal |title=Hestesporvognsdriften i Kristiania |last=Johannessen |first=Terje |last2=Andersen |first2=Bj\u00f8rn |year=2013 |volume=83 |pages=6\u201331 |journal=[[Lokaltrafikk]] |language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nVogt and Due's concession was transferred to a company, A/S Kristiania Sporveisselskab, which was incorporated on 26 August 1874. The share capital was set to 200,000 [[Norwegian speciedaler|speciedaler]].<ref>Fasting: 9</ref> The company bought a lot on [[Pilestredet]] 10,000 speciedaler, which became the site of [[Homansbyen Depot]], including the company's administration. In its original design it had places for 44 vehicles and 116 horses, as well as a smithy, offices, apartments, a laboratory for the veterinary and a sick bay for twelve horses.<ref name=\"Fristad: 19\">Fristad: 19</ref> The company was permitted to use tracks on top of the roads, although the municipality retained the right at any time to require them to be dug down. The company opted for [[standard gauge]], presumably because this was most common amongst horsecars and eased procurement. Track-laying started in May 1875.<ref name=hestesporvogn /> Because of the location of the depot and the low traffic estimates along Drammensveien, KSS opted to instead build a branch to Homansbyen.<ref>Fasting: 12</ref>\n\n[[File:KSS horsecars 1876.jpg|thumb|left|Horsecars outside [[Oslo Cathedral]] in 1876]]\nThe first twenty-two trams arrived from [[John Stephenson Company]] on 2 September 1875. The first horses arrived nine days later. Trial runs started on 21 September and operating permit was granted on 4 October. The official opening took place the following day. Regular traffic started on 6 October, as the second horsecar system in the Nordic Countries, after [[Copenhagen]]. The original network consisted of three services: from Homansbyen to [[Stortorvet (station)|Stortorvet]], from Vestbanen to Stortorvet and from Stortorvet to Oslo. The services to Vestbanen corresponded with trains, while the other two operated every ten minutes. The fares were set to 10 \u00f8re. Shortly after a direct service was set up from Homansbyen to Vestbanen.<ref name=hestesporvogn />\n\n===Horsecar operations===\nOslo was at the time a highly segregated community with little interaction between the higher and lower classes. Amongst the concerns of the upper classes was that the trams would become popular with the lower classes and that there would be more interaction between classes.<ref>Fristad: 12</ref> At first there were no regular stops, the horsecar would simply lower its speed and allow people to jump on and off where they wished. This was especially important on hills to keep the momentum and not wear out the horses. The horsecar would stop for elderly passengers and those of sufficient prominence.<ref name=hestesporvogn /> The company took delivery of seventeen sleds for use during winter. These proved much less suitable for operations, as the horses could not pull the same load on snow as on rails. The turnover time for horses was reduced, resulting in increased [[headway]]. The company therefore decided to salt and plow the tracks and instead use the horsecars during winter.<ref name=fr21>Fristad: 21</ref>\n\n[[File:KSS horsecar 1880.jpg|thumb|Horsecar in 1880]]\nProfits were made immediately, and in 1877 an additional seven cars were delivered,<ref name=a6>Aspenberg: 6</ref> allowing the headway to drop to five minutes.<ref name=\"Fristad: 19\"/> The company became a major retailer of used horses. These were sought after due to the good treatment they received at the company. However, if they ever walked down a street with tracks they would follow these blindly and it was difficult to get them to diverge off the route.<ref>Fristad: 20</ref> From 1878, the fare increased to 15 \u00f8re for all routes.<ref>Fristad: 15</ref> KSS opened its first extension on 18 March 1878, when the first part of the [[Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka\u2013Torshov Line]] opened from Storgata to Thorvald Meyers gate. It was further extended to Beyer Bridge on 12 April 1879.<ref name=\"fr138\"/> In conjunction with this a new depot was built at Olaf Ryes plass with place for fifty horses and a number of horsecars.<ref name=fr21 /> The Vestbanen Line was extended to Munkedamsveien on 5 May 1879.<ref name=a6 />\n\nOnce these expansions were made the company fell more into a state of operation. From 9 July 1880 all routes terminating at Stortorvet were merged, resulting in direct services from Homansbyen to Oslo and from Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka to Vestbanen. This also meant that passengers no longer had to buy a new ticket for a transfer.<ref name=hestesporvogn /> Between 1887 and 1892 the company took delivery of seventeen new vehicles from [[Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk|Skabo]].<ref name=fr21 /> During the 1890s the company carried out some [[double track]]ing.<ref name=hestesporvogn /> The final batch of fifteen horsecars, built by [[Falkenried]], were delivered in 1897. They were so heavy they needed to be hauled by two horses and were designed with the intension of being used as trailers for the electric trams.<ref>Fristad: 33</ref>\n\n[[File:Opening of electric traction to Munkedamsveien.jpg|thumb|left|Opening of the electrification of the [[Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka\u2013Torshov Line]] on 29 September 1899.]]\n\n===Electrification===\n[[Kristiania Elektriske Sporvei]] (KES) became the second tramway operator in Oslo when it opened its first two electric tramway lines on 2 March 1893.<ref>Aspenberg: 7</ref> Although the new company received a permit for two new lines, KSS retained a preferential treatment allowing priority in building later new lines.<ref name=f42>Fasting: 42</ref> KES had significantly lower operating costs and only charged 10 \u00f8re for its tickets. Although only very few locations had a choice between the two companies, KSS was soon viewed as outdated and expensive.<ref name=fr62>Fristad: 62</ref> They chose to cut their ticket prices to 10 \u00f8re in 1896.<ref>Fristad: 27</ref>\n\nTo alleviate the situation, KSS's board approved plans in December 1897 for electrify their network. Meanwhile, the board decided to convert its entire network to double track. As tracks for an electric tramway had to be designed to allow for return current, an all-new trackage would have to be laid. These plans were approved by the annual meeting on 17 January 1898. The company both needed a supplier and capital, and struck a deal with [[Union-Elektricit\u00e4ts-Gesellschaft]], who would deliver the new infrastructures and trams, and also provided capital through purchasing a majority stake in the company. There was a general understanding for the conversion in the public, although there were many protests against installing [[overhead line]]s in [[Karl Johans gate]].<ref name=hestesporvogn />\n\n[[File:KSS Class U tram and horsecar trailer.jpg|thumb|Class U tram hauling a converted horsecar trailer at [[Homansbyen Depot]] in 1905]]\nThe first section which was electrified was from Munkedamsveien to Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka, on 29 September 1899.<ref name=a10>Aspenberg: 10</ref> The same day the line was extended to [[Torshov (station)|Torshov]].<ref>Fristad: 34</ref> The Homansbyen and Oslo Lines were electrified on 17 November,<ref name=fr137>Fristad: 137</ref> except for the section from [[Oslo Hospital (station)|Oslo Hospital]] to [[St Halvards plass (station)|St Halvards plass]], which had to be hauled by horses until 15 January 1900.<ref>Fristad: 35</ref> This work required the delivery of new electrical trams. Forty-seven [[KES and KSS Class U|Class U]] units were delivered in 1899, with electrical equipment from Union and bodies built by Falkenried and [[Linke-Hofmann-Busch]]. Thirty-eight horsecars were converted to trailers.<ref name=a45>Aspenberg: 45</ref>\n\nThe company continued the work by opening the [[V\u00e5lerenga Line]] on 3 May.<ref name=fr137 /> The [[Kampen Line]] opened on 6 June. Both of these were branches of the Gamlebyen Line.<ref name=fr138>Fristad: 138</ref> This resulted in a major restructuring of the routes, with five lines each running on a ten-minute headway. The Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka\u2013Torshov Line was the next to be expanded. Unlike the rest, it was financed by the municipalities of Kristiania and [[Aker, Norway|Aker]], and was the first of KSS's lines to run outside the Kristiania's municipal borders.<ref>Fristad: 37</ref> It opened in two stages, to Sandaker on 2 October 1901 to [[Grefsen Station]] on 28 November 1902.<ref name=fr138 />\n\n[[File:KSS type S 1915.jpg|thumb|left|A converted [[KKS Class S|Class S]] tram in 1915, inherited from KKS]]\n\n===Consolidation===\nBy 1897 the [[Liberal Party (Norway)|Liberal Party]] had received a majority in the municipal council.

KSS applied to build a tramway there, but on 23 September 1897 the municipal council voted to establish its own tram company, [[Kristiania Kommunale Sporveie]] (KKS), and build a line to St. Hanshaugen Sagene itself.<ref name=f52>Fasting: 52</ref> This resulted in three new lines. [[Sagene Ring]] opened in November 1899.<ref>Faster: 56</ref><ref>Fristad: 45</ref> The [[Rodel\u00f8kka Line]], which opened in January 1900, used the lower section of the Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka Line to reach the city center. The [[Vippetangen Line]] was completed in August. However, none of the three lines connected with each other and KKS had to lease track from KSS.<ref>Fasting: 58</ref>\n\nKSS had a [[concession (contract)|concession]] which expired in 1905, at which time the municipality could purchase the company at par value. This raised a new debate concerning public or private operations, with many Conservative politicians calling for the privatization of KKS.<ref>Fasting: 64</ref> In the 1904 municipal election the issue was raised, with the Liberal Party and the socialist parties running for municipalization of tram operations. Meanwhile, the municipal administration worked with estimates for taking over KSS. A take-over would cost the municipality about NOK&nbsp;2 million, while a sale would bring in about NOK&nbsp;1.6 million. However, as KSS was a profitable company, it was estimated that the municipality would make more money by taking over KSS than selling KKS, estimated at about NOK&nbsp;3 million for the period in question. The decisive municipal council meeting was held on 14 April 1905, although the actual vote did not occur until 02:00 hours the following day, after a nine-hour debate.<ref>Fasting: 65</ref> The Conservative majority voted in favor of selling KKS to KSS and extending the latter's concession to 1924.<ref>Fasting: 66</ref>\n\n[[File:KSS tram 221.jpg|thumb|Tram hauling open Skabo trailer outside [[Sagene Church]] on [[Sagene Ring]]]]\nWith the takeover KSS required not only three lines, but also a fleet of twenty [[KKS Class S|Class S]] motorized trams and twelve trailers.<ref name=\"a45\"/> It also took over two depots.

KES had done this a few months earlier and taken the first three digits, so KSS numbered their lines 4 through 10.<ref>Fristad: 51</ref> From 1912 the two companies started to cooperate closely with their routes. This first materialized in a connecting line in Hegdehaugsveien, which allowed trams to run from Stortorvet via the Homansbyen Line to reach the [[Briskeby Line]] and [[Majorstuen (station)|Majorstuen]]. At Skillebekk a connection was built through Munkedamsveien, allowing the Vestbanen Line access to the [[Sk\u00f8yen Line]]. The third connection opened in 1915, linking Jernbanetorget to the [[Kampen Line]] and the [[V\u00e5lerenga Line]] through a connection along Vognmannsgata, Brugata and Vaterland Bridge, allowing trams from there to serve [[Oslo East Station]].<ref name=fr52>Fristad: 52</ref>\n\n[[File:KSS Brill tram.jpg|thumb|left|The one tram built by [[J.

At this point the municipality was free to purchase the companies at par value. A municipal committee was appointed in 1922 to look into the matter. KES was valuated at NOK&nbsp;9 million, while KSS was worth NOK&nbsp;12.5 million. The committees majority proposed a merger and that KSS received a prolonged concession, while the minority recommended that the tramways be bought by the city. A third option, a jointly public and privately owned company, was also proposed, where the municipality would own fifty-one percent.<ref name=f91>Fasting: 91</ref>\n\nThe issue was considered by the council's executive board, which supported the joint public\u2013private proposal with eleven against nine votes. The argumentation was largely ideological: the left side accused the right for bringing economic advantages for private investors, while the right accused the left of insufficient financial investigations of municipal operations.<ref name=f91 /> The issue was voted on in the municipal council in December, with 43 against 41 councillors supporting the joint model. The latter were members of the [[Communist Party of Norway|Communist Party]] and the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labor Party]], who both were in favor of a municipal take-over. The new company, Kristiania Sporveier, was incorporated in May 1924 and took over all street tram operations.

A portion of the initial land was taken from the [[Nisqually tribe]]'s reservation. (The Nisqually people would later petition unsuccessfully for the return of this land.) <ref name=\"Kluger 2011 252\">{{Cite book|title=The Bitter Waters of Medicine Creek: A Tragic Clash Between White and Native America|last=Kluger|first=Richard|publisher=Vintage Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0-307-38896-4|location=New York|pages=252}}</ref> In 1927, Pierce County passed another bond measure to establish a military airfield just north of Fort Lewis. The airfield, called Tacoma Field, opened in 1930 and was renamed McChord Field in 1940. McChord Field separated from Fort Lewis when the U.S. Air Force was created in 1947 and was subsequently renamed McChord Air Force Base. The two bases operated independently of one another for more than 60 years before merging in 2010.\n\nFort Lewis began as Camp Lewis in 1917 when the citizens of Pierce County voted by an eight to one margin to bond themselves for $2&nbsp;million to buy 68,721 acres (278&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land. They donated the land to the federal government for military use. The only stipulation was that the tract be used as a permanent army post. Captain David L. Stone and his staff arrived at the camp site 26 May 1917, and a few days later the initial construction began. As work on the camp was pushing forward, the War Department named it \"Camp Lewis\" after [[Meriwether Lewis]] of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.<ref name=\"jblmws\"/> The entire camp was ready for occupancy a month ahead of schedule. In 90 days, Stone had supervised the construction of a \"city\" of 757 buildings and 422 other structures, all lighted and heated for 60,000 men. The first recruits moved into their new barracks on 5 September 1917, exactly two months after the post building plan had been handed to the contractors.\n\nWhen they implemented auction of the new cantonment, workmen subscribed $4,000 to build the main gate \u2013 which is still standing. The arch was built of [[fieldstone]] and squared logs resembling the old [[blockhouse]]s which stood in the northwest as forts. Some 60,000 men, including the [[13th Division (United States)|13th]] and [[91st Infantry Division (United States)|91st Division]]s, moved into the hastily constructed cantonment to train for World War I. Recruited largely from the northwest, the 91st was considered \"Washington's Own.\" In 1917, Pierce County, through the process of condemnation proceedings (eminent domain), took {{convert|3370|acre|km2}} of the [[Nisqually Indian Reservation]] (14&nbsp;km\u00b2) for the Fort Lewis Military Reserve.\n\nThe following two years saw tremendous activity at Camp Lewis as men mobilized and trained for war service. Thousands of the nation's youth learned to know Camp Lewis and the state of Washington. With the conclusion of the war, activities at Lewis ground to a standstill. Camp Lewis passed from the hands of Pierce County and became the property of the federal government when the deed for 62,432 acres (253&nbsp;km\u00b2) was recorded in the county auditor's office in Tacoma.\n\nWhen the [[Great War]] ended in 1918, the Nisqually people petitioned for their land to be returned to them, but the request was denied by the [[Secretary of War]], [[Newton Baker]].<ref name=\"Kluger 2011 252\"/>\n\nBrigadier General David L. Stone, who had supervised the original construction of Fort Lewis as a captain, returned as its commanding general in 1936, serving until 1937. The project of constructing an army airfield, which later became [[McChord Air Force Base]], directly north of the Fort Lewis installation, received approval as a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project in January 1938, and $61,730 was allocated for construction. The allocation provided for clearing, grading, and leveling a runway {{convert|6000|ft|m}} long by {{convert|600|ft|m}} wide.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1943, forty-two [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese]], [[Internment of German Americans|German]] and [[Internment of Italian Americans|Italian]] Americans were held at Fort Lewis as part of the government's \"enemy alien\" internment program during [[World War II]]. The Japanese and Italian internees were transferred to [[Fort Missoula Internment Camp|Fort Missoula]] and the Germans to [[Fort Lincoln Internment Camp|Fort Lincoln]], and the temporary detention facility closed on March 30, 1943.<ref>[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Fort%20Lewis%20%28detention%20facility%29/ \"Fort Lewis (detention facility)\"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''.

Sometime in the early 1960s [[Interstate 5]] was built through the fort separating the northwest corner of the fort, and creating \"Northfort\". With the departure of the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)]] for Vietnam in 1966, Fort Lewis once again became a personnel transfer and training center. [[David H. Hackworth]] described his service commanding a training battalion at the Fort during the [[Vietnam War]] in his memoir \"About Face\". In 1972, the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)]] was reactivated, and trained there until its deactivation in 1991.\n\nThe [[Fort Lewis Museum|Fort Lewis Military Museum]] was established in 1972 to preserve and document the post's history.\n\nThe base received much media attention in the wake of the [[Kandahar massacre]], committed by [[Robert Bales|a Fort Lewis soldier]] in March 2012.<ref>Hill, Christian, and Adam Ashton, \"Is Lewis-McChord A 'Troubled Base'?\", ''[[The News Tribune]]'', 18 March 2012.</ref>\n\nThe 1st Joint Mobilization Brigade disbanded in late May 2014.<ref>Jake Dorsey, [http://www.nwguardian.com/2014/05/29/18047/1st-jmb-inactivates-after-13-years.html 1st JMB inactivates after 13 years: Unit had an impact on Army\u2019s readiness of tens of thousands of service members, [[Northwest Guardian]], May 29, 2014.</ref> It previously controlled and provided host unit support to mobilizing, deploying and demobilizing reserve component units from all the U.S. military services.

The group of fewer than a dozen personnel mobilized about 15,000 soldiers within three weeks at the start of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].

The two bases operated independently of one another for more than 60 years before merging in 2010.\n\nFort Lewis began as Camp Lewis in 1917 when the citizens of Pierce County voted by an eight to one margin to bond themselves for $2&nbsp;million to buy 68,721 acres (278&nbsp;km\u00b2) of land. They donated the land to the federal government for military use. The only stipulation was that the tract be used as a permanent army post. Captain David L. Stone and his staff arrived at the camp site 26 May 1917, and a few days later the initial construction began. As work on the camp was pushing forward, the War Department named it \"Camp Lewis\" after [[Meriwether Lewis]] of the Lewis and Clark Expedition.<ref name=\"jblmws\"/> The entire camp was ready for occupancy a month ahead of schedule. In 90 days, Stone had supervised the construction of a \"city\" of 757 buildings and 422 other structures, all lighted and heated for 60,000 men. The first recruits moved into their new barracks on 5 September 1917, exactly two months after the post building plan had been handed to the contractors.\n\nWhen they implemented auction of the new cantonment, workmen subscribed $4,000 to build the main gate \u2013 which is still standing. The arch was built of [[fieldstone]] and squared logs resembling the old [[blockhouse]]s which stood in the northwest as forts. Some 60,000 men, including the [[13th Division (United States)|13th]] and [[91st Infantry Division (United States)|91st Division]]s, moved into the hastily constructed cantonment to train for World War I. Recruited largely from the northwest, the 91st was considered \"Washington's Own.\" In 1917, Pierce County, through the process of condemnation proceedings (eminent domain), took {{convert|3370|acre|km2}} of the [[Nisqually Indian Reservation]] (14&nbsp;km\u00b2) for the Fort Lewis Military Reserve.\n\nThe following two years saw tremendous activity at Camp Lewis as men mobilized and trained for war service. Thousands of the nation's youth learned to know Camp Lewis and the state of Washington. With the conclusion of the war, activities at Lewis ground to a standstill. Camp Lewis passed from the hands of Pierce County and became the property of the federal government when the deed for 62,432 acres (253&nbsp;km\u00b2) was recorded in the county auditor's office in Tacoma.\n\nWhen the [[Great War]] ended in 1918, the Nisqually people petitioned for their land to be returned to them, but the request was denied by the [[Secretary of War]], [[Newton Baker]].<ref name=\"Kluger 2011 252\"/>\n\nBrigadier General David L. Stone, who had supervised the original construction of Fort Lewis as a captain, returned as its commanding general in 1936, serving until 1937. The project of constructing an army airfield, which later became [[McChord Air Force Base]], directly north of the Fort Lewis installation, received approval as a [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] project in January 1938, and $61,730 was allocated for construction. The allocation provided for clearing, grading, and leveling a runway {{convert|6000|ft|m}} long by {{convert|600|ft|m}} wide.\n\nFrom 1942 to 1943, forty-two [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese]], [[Internment of German Americans|German]] and [[Internment of Italian Americans|Italian]] Americans were held at Fort Lewis as part of the government's \"enemy alien\" internment program during [[World War II]]. The Japanese and Italian internees were transferred to [[Fort Missoula Internment Camp|Fort Missoula]] and the Germans to [[Fort Lincoln Internment Camp|Fort Lincoln]], and the temporary detention facility closed on March 30, 1943.<ref>[http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Fort%20Lewis%20%28detention%20facility%29/ \"Fort Lewis (detention facility)\"] ''Densho Encyclopedia''. Retrieved 25 July 2014.</ref>\n\nAt the conclusion of World War II, the northwest staging area of Fort Lewis became a separation center and discharged its first soldiers in October 1945. Sometime in the early 1960s [[Interstate 5]] was built through the fort separating the northwest corner of the fort, and creating \"Northfort\". With the departure of the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)]] for Vietnam in 1966, Fort Lewis once again became a personnel transfer and training center. [[David H. Hackworth]] described his service commanding a training battalion at the Fort during the [[Vietnam War]] in his memoir \"About Face\". In 1972, the [[9th Infantry Division (United States)]] was reactivated, and trained there until its deactivation in 1991.\n\nThe [[Fort Lewis Museum|Fort Lewis Military Museum]] was established in 1972 to preserve and document the post's history.\n\nThe base received much media attention in the wake of the [[Kandahar massacre]], committed by [[Robert Bales|a Fort Lewis soldier]] in March 2012.<ref>Hill, Christian, and Adam Ashton, \"Is Lewis-McChord A 'Troubled Base'?\", ''[[The News Tribune]]'', 18 March 2012.</ref>\n\nThe 1st Joint Mobilization Brigade disbanded in late May 2014.<ref>Jake Dorsey, [http://www.nwguardian.com/2014/05/29/18047/1st-jmb-inactivates-after-13-years.html 1st JMB inactivates after 13 years: Unit had an impact on Army\u2019s readiness of tens of thousands of service members, [[Northwest Guardian]], May 29, 2014.</ref> It previously controlled and provided host unit support to mobilizing, deploying and demobilizing reserve component units from all the U.S. military services. The unit began as the 2122st Garrison Support Unit (Army Reserve), overseeing the mobilization of about 27,000 Soldiers. The group of fewer than a dozen personnel mobilized about 15,000 soldiers within three weeks at the start of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]]. The unit was redesignated the 654th Area Support Group (Forward) in May 2004, and the 1st JMB in March 2007.

This marked the first time that I Corps had forward soldiers in combat since the end of the [[Korean War]]. Task Force Olympia included units from all three components of the Army (Active, Reserve and National Guard) as well as [[Marine (military)|Marine]] and [[Australian]] officers. Task Force Olympia's subordinate units included the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, [[2nd Infantry Division (United States)|2nd Infantry Division]], which deployed for Iraq on 8 November 2003, and returned to Fort Lewis after one year of combat duty, and the 1st Brigade, [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], which departed Fort Lewis on 15 September 2004, for one year and returned September 2005.

YTC has vast flat valleys separated by intervening ridges which are suited to large-scale mechanized or motorized forces. Much of the steeper terrain resembles areas of Afghanistan. Twenty-five ranges, including the state-of-the-art Multi-Purpose Range Complex and Shoot House, are available for individual or collective training.<ref name=\"jblmws\"/>\n\nPrior to 1941, the area consisted of ranches and a few scattered silica mines. Just before World War II, the Army's need for a large training and maneuver area became apparent, and the Army negotiated with landowners to lease {{convert|160,000|acre|km2}} for the Yakima Anti-Aircraft Artillery Range. Military organizations in the Pacific Northwest used the center for range firing and small unit tests.  The first range was constructed in 1942 on [[Umtanum Ridge]], {{convert|13|mi|km}} northeast of the present cantonment area.<ref name=\"jblmws\"/>\n\nIn 1947, approximately {{convert|60000|acre|km2}} were cleared of unexploded ammunition and returned to the original owners. During 1949 and 1950, the state of Washington used the center for summer training of its National Guard units and regular Army troops were permanently assigned to the center. At the start of the Korean War, the Army decided to expand Yakima Training Center. In 1951, the Installation was enlarged to {{convert|261,451|acre|km2}} and construction of the current cantonment area began.<ref name=\"jblmws\"/>\n\nIn 1986, a further expansion was initiated, and in 1992, the Army acquired additional land to enlarge YTC to {{convert|327,000|acre|km2}}.

Army helicopters were also used to insert search-and-rescue [SAR] teams into inaccessible areas on the east, north, and west sides of the mountain, lowering rangers to the ground by a cable device known as a \"jungle penetrator\". Helicopters began assisting with high altitude (above 10,000 feet) SAR operations in the 1980s. Helicopters were also used for \"short haul\" rescue operations, in which a ranger and litter were carried in a sling below the helicopter to the scene of the accident.<ref name=\"GAAF\"/>\n\nDuring World War II the [[Air Transport Command (United States Air Force)|Air Transport Command]] 4131st Army Air Force Base Unit used GAAF as the [[CONUS]] hub for the Alaskan [[West Coast Wing]], ferrying supplies, equipment and aircraft to [[Eleventh Air Force]] at [[Elmendorf Field]], near Anchorage.

The total area is 3.78% water. The military base is, as previously stated, much larger than the CDP defined by the Census Bureau.\n\nFort Lewis' terrain is primarily a mixture of dense conifer woods and open Puget prairie-[[garry oak]] woodlands. Invasive [[Scotch Broom]] has taken over many areas. The landscape is very rocky from glacial meltwater deposits. [[Toxicodendron diversilobum|Poison oak]] is found in the training areas. [[Canada Thistle]] grows thickly in some areas. All trees are to be left standing; post policy prohibits cutting or trimming them.\n\nThe temperatures during summer vary from the mid 40s at night to the mid 70s during the day, occasionally peaking over {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.

That earned Clayton the [[NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal]] (1992) for \u201ctheoretical astrophysics related to the formation of (chemical) elements in the explosions of stars and to the observable products of these explosions\u201d. Supernovae thereafter became the most important stellar events in astronomy owing to their profoundly radioactive nature.

They are: (1) [[nucleosynthesis]], the assembly within stars of the atomic nuclei of the common [[chemical element]]s by nuclear reactions occurring therein; (2) astronomical detection of [[gamma-ray]] lines emitted by [[radioactive]] atoms created and ejected by supernovae; (3) mathematical models of the growth over time of the interstellar abundances of radioactive atoms; (4) predictions of the existence of interstellar [[cosmic dust]] grains from individual stars\u2014individual chunks of long-dead stars. He named those [[Cosmic dust#Stardust|stardust]], each containing isotopically identifiable radioactive atoms of the host stars; (5) predictions of the condensation of solid grains of pure [[carbon]] within hot, oxygen-dominated radioactive [[supernova]] gases. Clayton launched these original ideas from research positions at California Institute of Technology, Rice University, Cambridge University (England), Max-Plank Institute for Nuclear Physics (Germany), Durham University (England) and Clemson University during an international academic career spanning six decades.\n\nClayton also authored four books for the public: (1) a novel, ''The Joshua Factor'' (1985), is a parable of the origin of mankind utilizing the mystery of solar neutrinos; (2) a science autobiography, ''Catch a Falling Star'';<ref name=\"claytonstarcatcher1\">{{cite book |first=Donald D|last= Clayton |title=Catch a Falling Star: A Life Discovering Our Universe |year=2009|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> (3) a mid-career memoir ''The Dark Night Sky'',<ref name=\"dark\">{{cite book|publisher=Quadrangle|location= New York |year=1975|title=The Dark Night Sky: A Personal Adventure in Cosmology|url=https://archive.org/details/darknightskypers0000clay|url-access=registration|first=Donald D|last= Clayton|isbn=0812905857}}</ref> of cultural interest owing to Clayton's conception of it in 1970 as layout for a movie<ref name=\"claytonstarcatcher1\"/>{{rp|245\u2013249}} with Italian filmmaker [[Roberto Rossellini]] <ref name=\"clemson.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/70CRosselini1.html|title=1970 Clayton and Rosselini in Sardinia|accessdate=27 August 2014|publisher=[[Clemson University]]}}</ref> about growing awareness during a cosmological life (See Personal below); (4)''Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos'' (Cambridge Univ.

He was awarded many supporting fellowships: [[National Science Foundation]] Predoctoral Fellow (1956\u201358); [[Alfred P.

Clayton spent much of his early childhood on those farms and has rhapsodized over his love of the farm.<ref name=\"claytonstarcatcher1\"/>{{rp|1\u20136}} Clayton attended public school in [[Texas]] after his father's new job as co-pilot for [[Braniff Airlines]] moved the family to [[Dallas]] in 1939. His parents purchased a home in the already renowned [[Highland Park, Texas|Highland Park]] school system, providing him excellent education. He  graduated third in his 1953 class of 92 students<ref>Catch a Falling Star op cit , p. 84</ref> from [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]]. Becoming the first among his entire Iowa relations to seek post-high-school education, Clayton matriculated at [[Southern Methodist University]] and excelled in physics and mathematics, graduating ''summa cum laude'' in 1956.\n\nAt the urging of his SMU professors, he applied as a physics research student to [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), which he attended bearing a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship. In the 1957 [[nuclear physics]] course at Caltech Clayton learned from [[William Alfred Fowler]] about a new theory that the chemical elements had been assembled within the stars by nuclear reactions occurring there. He was captivated for life by that idea.<ref name=\"dark\"/>{{rp|112\u2013114}} Clayton completed his Ph.D. Thesis in 1961 on the growth of the abundances of the heavy elements owing to the slow capture of free neutrons (the [[s process]]) by more abundant lighter elements in stars. Clayton and his wife Mary Lou<ref>Note: Mary Lou Clayton was hired by Mathew Sands on the Ford Foundation project for these lectures. Donald Clayton contributed time to help identify the physics vocabulary that Feynman used. See ''Catch a Falling Star'', p. 142</ref> played a small role in producing the celebrated [[Feynman Lectures on Physics]] by converting the taped audio of [[Richard Feynman]]'s lectures to prose. Caltech afforded Clayton the chance to meet and later become a lifelong friend of [[Fred Hoyle]], British cosmologist and creator of the theory of nucleosynthesis in stars. Hoyle exerted strong lifetime influence on Clayton. Clayton's published collaborations with Fowler (1983 Nobel Laureate in Physics) as Fowler's<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald D. |last=Clayton |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFN4srk0bnsC&lpg=PT162&pg=PT179 |title=Catch a Falling Star |chapter=S Process and my Journeyman's Rating |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> research student (1957\u201360) and subsequently as Fowler's post-doctoral research associate (1961\u201363) launched Clayton's scientific career.\n\nHe established himself at Caltech as a new worker in the field of [[nucleosynthesis]] in stars by calculating the first time-dependent models of both the [[s process]] and the fast neutron-capture chains of the [[r process]] of heavy-element nucleosynthesis and of the nuclear abundance quasiequilibrium that establishes the highly radioactive abundances between silicon and nickel during silicon burning in stars. He came onto the field early, when nucleosynthesis was a vibrant, modern frontier. Citations are in the Nucleosynthesis section below.\n\n==Academic history==\nA historic connection of Clayton's academic career to NASA's Apollo Program arose  arose through establishment by Rice University of its Department of Space Science in 1963. This action by Rice University provided the academic position assumed by Clayton in 1963. Clayton described this good fortune in his autobiography<ref>p. 159-163, ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref>. His academic research into five fields of astrophysics championed by him is detailed in section 5 below. Foundational academic positions at Caltech, Rice University and Clemson University were augmented by international breadth: seven-year-long academic affiliations in Cambridge (1967\u20131974) and later in Heidelberg (1976\u201382),<ref>Clayton, p. 178, Chapters 10 and 15 of his autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> as well as by visiting summer positions in Cardiff UK (1976, 1977)<ref>Chap. 15, p.369 of Clayton's autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> as well as sabbatical leaves in Cambridge (1971), Heidelberg (1981) and Durham University UK (1987).<ref>p. 439\u2013442, autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref>\n\nFollowing his two-year (1961\u201363) postdoctoral research fellowship at Caltech, Clayton was awarded an Assistant Professorship, one of the four founding faculty members in [[Rice University]]'s newly created Department of Space Science (later renamed Space Physics and Astronomy). There he initiated  a graduate-student course explaining nuclear reactions in stars as the mechanism for the creation of the atoms of our chemical elements. His pioneering textbook based on that course (''Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis'', McGraw-Hill 1968) earned ongoing praise. In 2018, 50 years after its first publication, it is still in common usage<ref>University of Chicago Press, reprint edition 1983</ref> in graduate education throughout the world. At Rice Clayton was awarded the newly endowed Andrew Hays Buchanan Professorship of Astrophysics in 1968 and held that endowed professorship for twenty years until responding to the opportunity to guide a new astrophysics program at [[Clemson University]] in 1989. During the 1970s at Rice University Clayton guided Ph.D. theses of many research students who achieved renown, especially [[Stanford E. Woosley]], William Michael Howard, H. C. Goldwire, Richard A. Ward, Michael J. Newman, Eliahu Dwek, Mark Leising and Kurt Liffman. Senior thesis students at Rice University included Bradley S. Meyer and Lucy Ziurys, both of whom forged distinguished careers in the subjects of those senior theses. Historical photos of several students can be seen on Clayton' s photo archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/index.html |title=Photo Archive In Nuclear Astrophysics: Photo List |publisher=Clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref>. Clayton followed the historic Apollo 11 mission while on holiday with his family in Ireland while traveling to Cambridge UK for his third research summer there.\n\nLetters in  winter 1966 from W.A. Fowler unexpectedly invited Clayton to return to Caltech in order to coauthor a book on [[nucleosynthesis]] with Fowler and Fred Hoyle. In his autobiography Clayton quotes these letters.<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald D. |last=Clayton |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFN4srk0bnsC&pg=PT215 |title=Catch a Falling Star |chapter=Getting the Call |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> He accepted that offer but the book was never written because while he was resident at Caltech Clayton was invited by Fred Hoyle to [[Cambridge University]] (UK) in spring 1967 to advise a research program in nucleosynthesis at Hoyle's newly created [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]]. The award to Clayton of an [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] Fellowship (1966\u201368) facilitated leaves of absence from Rice University for this purpose. Clayton exerted that research leadership in Cambridge during 1967-72 by bringing his research students from Rice University with him. That prolific period ended abruptly by Hoyle's unexpected resignation from Cambridge University in 1972.<ref>Fred Hoyle, ''Home is where the wind blows'' (University Science Books, Mill Valley CA 1994) p. 372-376</ref> Clayton was during these years a Visiting Fellow of [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]]. At Rice University W.D. Arnett, S.E. Woosley, and W.M. Howard published jointly numerous innovative studies with Clayton on the topic of explosive [[supernova]] nucleosynthesis.<ref>W. David Arnett & Donald D. Clayton, \"Explosive nucleosynthesis in stars\", ''Nature'' 227, pp. 780-784 (1970); Woosley, S.E, Arnett, W.D., Clayton, D.D., \"Explosive burning of oxygen and silicon\", ''Astrophys. Journal'' Supplement 26, 231\u2013312 (1973)</ref> During his Cambridge years, Clayton proposed<ref>Clayton, S. Colgate and G. Fishman, Astrophysical Journal 155, 75 (1969); Clayton and J. Silk, ''Astrophysical Journal'' 158, L43 (1969)</ref> radioactive gamma-ray-emitting nuclei as nucleosynthesis sources for the field of [[gamma-ray astronomy]] of line transitions from radioactive nuclei with coauthors  ([[Stirling Colgate]], [[Gerald J. Fishman]], and [[Joseph Silk]]). Detection of these gamma-ray lines two decades later provided the decisive proof that [[iron]] had been synthesized explosively in supernovae in the form of radioactive [[nickel]] isotopes rather than as iron itself, which Fowler and Hoyle had both advocated.\n\nDuring (1977\u201384) Clayton resided part-time annually at the [[Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics]] in [[Heidelberg]] as [[Humboldt Prize]] awardee, sponsored by Till Kirsten. Annual academic leaves from Rice University facilitated this. There he joined the [[Meteoritical Society]] seeking audience for his newly published theoretical picture<ref>\u201cExtinct radioactivities: Trapped residuals of pre-solar grains\u201d, ''Astrophys. J.'', 199, 765\u201369, (1975); \u201c22Na, Ne-E, Extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar\u201d, Nature, 257, 36-37, (1975); \u201cCosmoradiogenic ghosts and the origin of Ca-Al-rich inclusions\u201d, Earth and Planetary Sci.

He hoped that such interstellar grains could be discovered within [[meteorites]];<ref>Clayton, ''Catch a falling star'', op cit, p. 354\u201357, p. 387\u2013395</ref> and he also advanced a related theory that he called ''cosmic chemical memory''<ref>Cosmic chemical memory: a new astronomy (1981 George Darwin Lecture of the RAS), QJRAS 23, 174-212 (1982)</ref> by which the effects of stardust can be measured in meteoritic minerals even if stardust itself no longer exists there. Clayton designated the crystalline component of interstellar dust that had condensed thermally from hot and cooling stellar gases by a new scientific name, ''stardust''. Stardust became an important component of [[cosmic dust]]. Clayton has described<ref>Chapter 14 of his autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> the stiff resistance encountered from meteoriticist referees of his early papers advancing this new theory. He nonetheless established that research program at Rice University, where he continued guiding graduate-student research on that topic. He and student Kurt Liffman computed a pathbreaking history of survival rates of refractory stardust in the interstellar medium after its ejection from stars;<ref>Stochastic histories of refractory interstellar dust, ''Proceedings Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 18, 637-657 (1988); Astrophys. J. 340, 853-868 (1989)</ref> and with student Mark D. Leising computed a propagation model of positron annihilation lines within nova explosions<ref>Astrophys. J. 323, 159-169 (1987)</ref> and of the angular distribution of gamma ray lines from radioactive <sup>26</sup>[[aluminum|Al]]  in the galaxy.<ref>Astrophys. J. 294, 591-598 (1985)</ref> Following laboratory discovery in 1987 of meteoritic  ''stardust'' bearing unequivocal isotopic markers of stars, Clayton was awarded the 1991 [[Leonard Medal]], the highest honor of the Meteoritical Society. Feeling vindicated,<ref>Clayton's own words in ''Catch a falling star'' op cit attest to his sense of vindication over this issue:(1) ''The telephone rings in s-process stardust'', p 400-401; (2)\"Comic battle over the Leonard Medal'', p. 489\u2013491</ref> Clayton exulted in ''Nature'' \"the human race holds solid samples of supernovae in its hands and studies them in terrestrial laboratories\".<ref>Donald D. Clayton, Nature 404, 329 (2000)</ref>\n\nIn 1989 Clayton accepted a professorship at Clemson University to develop a graduate research program in astrophysics there.<ref>''Catch a Falling Star'', Chap. 18</ref> He began this academic segment (1989\u2013present) by hiring three talented young astrophysicists <ref>Mark Leising, Dieter Hartmann and Bradley S. Meyer: ''Catch a Falling Star'' photo p. 494</ref> to vitalize joint research with the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (launched in 1991 after several delays). Its four  instruments successfully detected gamma-ray lines identifying several of the radioactive nuclei that Clayton had predicted to be present in supernova remnants. Clayton had been designated ten years earlier Co-Investigator on the NASA proposal submitted by James Kurfess for the Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment [[OSSE]], one of the four successful instruments carried into orbit by [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']], and he carried that research contract to Clemson. Simultaneously Clayton developed at Clemson his stardust research, introducing annual workshops for its researchers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://presolar.wustl.edu/Laboratory_for_Space_Sciences/Presolar_Grain_Workshop_2012.html |title=Presolar Grain workshop 2012 |publisher=Presolar.wustl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> The initial NASA-sponsored workshop at Clemson in 1990 was so lively that it was repeated the following year jointly with [[Washington University (St. Louis)]] cosponsorship, and in later years cosponsored also by the [[University of Chicago]] and by the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. These workshops featured the excitement of new isotopic discoveries, and also helped participants focus their ideas for submission of abstracts to NASA's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Otherwise participants' workshop discussions were not shared or publicized.\n\nEventually a unique new goal became to assemble from his large personal collection of photographs a web-based archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/index.html |title=Photo Archive In Nuclear Astrophysics |publisher=Clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> and to donate the original photographs<ref>[https://photos.aip.org/taxonomy/term/253]</ref> to the Center for the History of Physics<ref>Center for History of Physics is a wing of American Institute of Physics. It can be reached on the web at aip.org and clicking on History Programs</ref> The thrusts of Clayton's career at Clemson University are well represented on that Photo Archive by photos between 1990 and 2014. Following his retirement from academic duties in 2007, Clayton remained quite active in research problems involving condensation of dust within supernovae<ref>Donald Clayton & Bradley S.

In 1989 he resigned to accept an offer from Clemson University in South Carolina to guide the establishment of a research program in astrophysics. Clemson University had launched an effort to move into the top 20 of public universities, and Clayton's hire was part of that plan. He resides with Nancy in historic G. W. Gignilliat House (1898) in [[Seneca, South Carolina]] (pop. 8,000), seven miles from the city of [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]]. They jointly have one son who grew up in that house, Andrew, born in 1987 in [[Houston]]. Clayton's three previous children arose from his earlier marriages. A son (Donald Douglas Clayton b.1960, Pasadena CA) lives in Houston and a daughter (Alia Clayton Fisher, b. 1977, Houston) lives with her husband and four children in [[Longmont, Colorado]]. Another son, Devon Clayton (b. 1961 Pasadena), died in 1996 in Seneca SC. Clayton has one brother (d. 1980) and two sisters living in [[Texas]], two of whom were also born in [[Iowa]]. Clayton's mother and father had both been born on family farms in Fontanelle IA to parents <ref>''Catch a Falling Star'', p. 6-9</ref> who had lived their entire lives on Fontanelle farms. Their own parents had immigrated to Iowa near 1850 from England and Germany. Two of Clayton's great grandfathers (Kembery and Clayton) fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (North). Robert M. Clayton fought in Sherman's Army at the battle of Atlanta.<ref>National Archives, Muster Roll, 43rd Company, Army of Ohio Infantry</ref>\n\nWhile at Rice University Clayton was introduced by patron of the arts [[Dominique de Menil]] to Italian filmmaker [[Roberto Rossellini]], and they jointly conceived of a film about one scientist's deepening realizations during a cosmological life, a sequence of experiences which Clayton proposed <ref>p. 245\u2013249 in ''Catch a Falling Star''. The wiki article on [[Dominique de Menil]] documents the interaction of the de Menils with Rosselini through the Rice University Media Center</ref> to provide for that project. In summer 1970 Clayton spent two weeks in Rome working daily with Rosselini <ref name=\"clemson.edu\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/70Clayton.html|title=PHOTO ARCHIVE IN NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS|publisher=Clemson.edu|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> on that effort, which failed owing to insufficient financial support or to insufficiently theatrical plan.<ref>No documentation exists for this failure, so this conclusion is based on Clayton's memory of it in his autobiography</ref> Clayton's published early memoir ''The Dark Night Sky: a personal adventure in cosmology''<ref>Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co. (1975): A book columnist for the ''Washington Post'' wrote on March 21, 1976: \"Altogether more personal (than other books on cosmology that he was reviewing), ''The Dark Night Sky'' alternates cosmology with affable reminiscence. Clayton knows the rapture of astronomy and uses it to shuttle engagingly back and forth between Copernicus, Einstein, Stonehenge, the Milky Way and punts on Cambridge's Cam. A brooding, ecumenical enthusiast, Clayton dreads the vacant interstellar spaces as much as he loves galaxies, Texas, and the maple tree he planted a quarter of a century ago. His is a book of brainy charm\"</ref> laid out his plan for that film.\n\n==Citations of seminal research==\nClayton's research innovations in astrophysics and planetary science lay in five disciplines that have been largely introduced above; but the five sections here provide more details and more complete citations to his work for readers wanting more information. Clayton's own history of each topic as described within his autobiography, ''Catch a Falling Star'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonstarcatcher.com|title=Donald D. Clayton|publisher=Claytonstarcatcher.com|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> is given at the end of each section. The references are to Clayton's noteworthy published papers. Clayton's independent style produced an unusual 120 single-author research papers, a relatively large number for astrophysicists.\n\n===Nuclear physics origin of the chemical elements ([[Nucleosynthesis]])===\nTrained at Caltech as a nuclear physicist by Wm. A. Fowler, Clayton was well positioned to consider interactions of heavy nuclei with neutrons. These were believed by Fowler to govern the nucleosynthesis of nuclei heavier than iron. Clayton established that theory by calculations of the isotopic abundances of heavier elements produced by neutron irradiation of iron in stars for both the slow neutron capture [[S-process]] and the rapid neutron capture [[R-process]] of heavy-element [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] (processes first defined by [[B2FH|B<sup>2</sup>FH]]<ref>Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler & Hoyle RMP 29, 547 (1957)</ref>). Clayton's two papers in 1961 and 1965 on those topics demonstrated that the solar-system abundances had been created not by a single neutron irradiation but as superpositions of abundance patterns established in presolar stars by differing neutron irradiations.<ref>[Donald D. Clayton,W.A. Fowler, T. Hull & B.Zimmerman\"Neutron Capture Chains in Heavy Element Synthesis\" Annals of Physics, 12, 331-408 (1961); Phillip A. Seeger, Donald D. Clayton and W. A. Fowler \"Nucleosynthesis of Heavy Elements by Neutron Capture\" Ap. J. Suppl. 11, 121-166 (1965)]</ref> His 1961 calculations of s-process abundance patterns, achieved by mathematical analysis rather than by not-yet-mature digital computation, established Clayton as a nucleosynthesis theorist. They also provided a ''standard model'' for the s process abundance patterns<ref>Clayton published subsequent papers on the mathematical properties of that standard model, each bearing the title ''s-process studies'', followed by a specific subtitle. Those papers and their subtitles were: \"exact solution to a chain having two distinct cross section values\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 192, 501 (1974 with M.J. Newman; \"exact evaluation of an exponential distribution of exposures\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 193, 397 (1974) with R.A. Ward; \"Branching and the time scale\", ''Astrophys. J. Suppl.'' 31, 35 (1976) with R.A. Ward and M. J. Newman; \"Xenon and krypton isotopic abundances\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 224, 1000 (1978) with R. A. Ward; \"s-process studies in the light of new experimental cross section: distribution of neutron fluences and r-process residuals\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 257, 821 (1982) with F. Kaeppeler, H. Beer, K. Wisshak, R.L. Macklin and R. A. Ward</ref> that guided four decades of progress on the s process abundances and on derived characteristics of the r-process abundances. In 1967 Clayton turned to the supernova origin of the abundances of elements that can be created in stars from hydrogen and helium alone. Those so-called ''primary nucleosynthesis'' nuclei having atomic weights between silicon and nickel (A=28-62) are very abundant. To understand their dramatic alternating abundances he tested a new conceptual idea that he named ''nuclear quasiequilibrium during silicon burning''<ref name=\"D. Bodansky. D.D 1968\"/> The quasiequilibrium concept did explain the observed numbers of isotopes in the A=28-62 mass range, which had previously been unsolved.<ref>/ The B<sup>2</sup>FH review \"Synthesis of the Elements in Stars\" RMP 29, 547 (1957) had little correct to say in explanation of primary nucleosynthesis in this mass region.

Observational discovery of those gamma rays would later confirm explosive nucleosynthesis theory and cement mankind's understanding of the profoundly radioactive nature of supernovae.  It is  the innovation for which Clayton is best known. His NASA-funded research at Rice University during the 1970s sought after additional nuclear prospects<ref name=\"Donald Clayton pp. 401\u2013426\">Donald Clayton, \"Cosmic radioactivity: a gamma-ray search for the origins of atomic nuclei, in ''ESSAYS IN NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS'', Barnes, Clayton & Schramm, eds., pp. 401\u2013426 (Cambridge University Press, 1982)</ref> for that high-energy spectroscopic astronomy, which is based on the recognizable energies of gamma rays emitted by individual radioactive nuclei that had recently been ejected from supernovae. Today it has blossomed with many observational results after quickly becoming a goal for future space astronomy missions, especially at a time when [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] was being proposed to NASA in 1977 (launched by [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]] in 1991). Hopes were suddenly raised for a detectable source when in 1987 optical astronomers discovered a nearby supernova called [[SN1987A]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]].

In 1964 he discovered a new method for measuring the age of interstellar nuclei based on the larger than expected observed abundances of stable daughters of radioactive nuclei.<ref>[Donald D.

Reasoning that interstellar gas contains a higher concentrations of shorter-lived radioactive nuclei than do the stars, Clayton invented in 1985 new mathematical solutions for the simplified differential equations of galactic abundance evolution that for the first time rendered these relationships understandable,<ref>Donald Clayton, \u201cGalactic chemical evolution and nucleocosmochronology: A standard model\u201d, in ''Challenges and New Developments in Nucleosynthesis'', W.

Clayton then calculated an age of 13-15 billion years for the oldest galactic nuclei,<ref name=\"Mon. Notices Roy 1988\"/> which would necessarily approximate the long-sought age of our galaxy. More recently radioactive  cosmochronology has diminished in importance because more precise techniques for determining the age of the Milky Way have been discovered in the cosmic microwave background. Nonetheless, his analytic solutions demonstrated importantly that the concentration of short-lived radioactive nuclei in interstellar gas had routinely been underestimated by the factor (k+1), where k is an integer near 2 or 3 that measures the steepness of the rate of decline of the infall of pristine gas onto our growing galactic mass.<ref>[Donald D.

These are called the ''extinct radioactivities'' because none remain on earth today but which did leave clear evidence of their prior existence in meteorites. Solution for a model history for the origin of our solar system that simultaneously fits their residual abundances became the guiding principle for a new discipline that focuses on local ''extra'' nucleosynthesis near the solar interstellar cloud during the billion years preceding solar birth.<ref>[\u201cShort-lived Radioactivities and the Birth of the Sun\u201d, B.S.

Aspects of interstellar-phase mixing are sure to remain important for decades to come while astronomers probe the circumstances of solar birth using accurate meteoritic data revealing the abundances of the extinct radioactive nuclei.

He reached that conclusion after Weihong Liu and Alexander Dalgarno<ref>W. Liu & A. Dalgarno, ''Astrophys. J.'' 454, 472\u201379 (1995)</ref> showed that radioactive decays of <sup>56</sup>[[cobalt|Co]] create fast Compton-scattered electrons that would dissociate the CO molecule [e+CO > e'+C+O], thereby preventing the complete oxidation of carbon atoms within young remnants of core-collapse supernovae. Clayton initiated an energetic crusade in 1998<ref>D. D. Clayton, \"Condensing carbon SUNOCONs when O>C\", ''Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 29 (1998); D Clayton, W Liu & A Dalgarno \u201cCondensation of Carbon in Radioactive Supernova Gas\u201d, ''Science'' 283, 1290\u20131292 (1999); W Liu & D Clayton, \"Condensation of carbon in supernovae: 1. Basic Chemistry\" Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 30 (1999), and D. Clayton & W. Liu \"Condensation of Carbon in Supernovae 2. Graphite in meteorites\", ''Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 30 (1999)</ref> demonstrating that the vast reservoir of carbon in core-collapse supernovae must condense as carbon dust despite being bathed in more-abundant oxygen gas. This idea met skepticism from meteoriiticists and cosmochemists because it contradicted a commonly accepted rule of thumb that held that the abundance of carbon must exceed that of oxygen (written C>O) in order for carbon to condense. Clayton advocated that supernova carbon stardust (which in 1977 he had named<ref>Donald D. Clayton, \"Precondensed matter: Key to the early solar system\", ''Moon & Planets'' 19, 109(1978)</ref> ''SUNOCONs'', an acronym for SUperNOva CONdensates) could therefore assemble within hot supernova C+O gases containing more oxygen than carbon and nothing else. Rather than a specialist's chemical detail, this is a profound conclusion for astrophysics because it partly explains the large amounts of dust created by supernovae in the early universe. Meteoritic chemists to whom his 1998-99 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference papers were addressed  doubted that possibility on intuitive but erroneous chemical grounds, believing that abundant hot oxygen gas would oxidize all carbon atoms leaving them trapped within chemically inert CO molecules\u2014an expectation that holds true in ordinary stars. Clayton asserted that this incorrect chemical rule-of-thumb was erroneously biasing interpretive studies of carbon SUNOCONs (primarily SiC grains and graphite grains). With Lih-Sin The at Clemson he computed the large density of energetic electrons produced by scattering of gamma rays <ref>D.D. Clayton and L.S. The, ''Astrophys J.'', \"Bremmstrahlung and Energetic Electrons in Supernovae\", ''Ap.J.'' 375, 221-38 (1991)</ref> emitted by radioactive cobalt.

That earned Clayton the [[NASA Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal]] (1992) for \u201ctheoretical astrophysics related to the formation of (chemical) elements in the explosions of stars and to the observable products of these explosions\u201d. Supernovae thereafter became the most important stellar events in astronomy owing to their profoundly radioactive nature.

They are: (1) [[nucleosynthesis]], the assembly within stars of the atomic nuclei of the common [[chemical element]]s by nuclear reactions occurring therein; (2) astronomical detection of [[gamma-ray]] lines emitted by [[radioactive]] atoms created and ejected by supernovae; (3) mathematical models of the growth over time of the interstellar abundances of radioactive atoms; (4) predictions of the existence of interstellar [[cosmic dust]] grains from individual stars\u2014individual chunks of long-dead stars. He named those [[Cosmic dust#Stardust|stardust]], each containing isotopically identifiable radioactive atoms of the host stars; (5) predictions of the condensation of solid grains of pure [[carbon]] within hot, oxygen-dominated radioactive [[supernova]] gases. Clayton launched these original ideas from research positions at California Institute of Technology, Rice University, Cambridge University (England), Max-Plank Institute for Nuclear Physics (Germany), Durham University (England) and Clemson University during an international academic career spanning six decades.\n\nClayton also authored four books for the public: (1) a novel, ''The Joshua Factor'' (1985), is a parable of the origin of mankind utilizing the mystery of solar neutrinos; (2) a science autobiography, ''Catch a Falling Star'';<ref name=\"claytonstarcatcher1\">{{cite book |first=Donald D|last= Clayton |title=Catch a Falling Star: A Life Discovering Our Universe |year=2009|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> (3) a mid-career memoir ''The Dark Night Sky'',<ref name=\"dark\">{{cite book|publisher=Quadrangle|location= New York |year=1975|title=The Dark Night Sky: A Personal Adventure in Cosmology|url=https://archive.org/details/darknightskypers0000clay|url-access=registration|first=Donald D|last= Clayton|isbn=0812905857}}</ref> of cultural interest owing to Clayton's conception of it in 1970 as layout for a movie<ref name=\"claytonstarcatcher1\"/>{{rp|245\u2013249}} with Italian filmmaker [[Roberto Rossellini]] <ref name=\"clemson.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/70CRosselini1.html|title=1970 Clayton and Rosselini in Sardinia|accessdate=27 August 2014|publisher=[[Clemson University]]}}</ref> about growing awareness during a cosmological life (See Personal below); (4)''Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos'' (Cambridge Univ.

He was awarded many supporting fellowships: [[National Science Foundation]] Predoctoral Fellow (1956\u201358); [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] Fellow (1966\u201368); [[Fulbright Fellow]] (1979\u201380); Fellow of St. Mary's College, [[Durham University]] (1987);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1980s/87WolfendaleCb.html|title=Arnold Wolfendale and Donald Clayton|accessdate=27 August 2014|publisher=Clemson University }}</ref> SERC Senior Visiting Fellow, [[The Open University]], [[Milton Keynes]], U.K. (1993).

Clayton spent much of his early childhood on those farms and has rhapsodized over his love of the farm.<ref name=\"claytonstarcatcher1\"/>{{rp|1\u20136}} Clayton attended public school in [[Texas]] after his father's new job as co-pilot for [[Braniff Airlines]] moved the family to [[Dallas]] in 1939. His parents purchased a home in the already renowned [[Highland Park, Texas|Highland Park]] school system, providing him excellent education. He  graduated third in his 1953 class of 92 students<ref>Catch a Falling Star op cit , p. 84</ref> from [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]]. Becoming the first among his entire Iowa relations to seek post-high-school education, Clayton matriculated at [[Southern Methodist University]] and excelled in physics and mathematics, graduating ''summa cum laude'' in 1956.\n\nAt the urging of his SMU professors, he applied as a physics research student to [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), which he attended bearing a National Science Foundation Predoctoral Fellowship. In the 1957 [[nuclear physics]] course at Caltech Clayton learned from [[William Alfred Fowler]] about a new theory that the chemical elements had been assembled within the stars by nuclear reactions occurring there. He was captivated for life by that idea.<ref name=\"dark\"/>{{rp|112\u2013114}} Clayton completed his Ph.D. Thesis in 1961 on the growth of the abundances of the heavy elements owing to the slow capture of free neutrons (the [[s process]]) by more abundant lighter elements in stars. Clayton and his wife Mary Lou<ref>Note: Mary Lou Clayton was hired by Mathew Sands on the Ford Foundation project for these lectures. Donald Clayton contributed time to help identify the physics vocabulary that Feynman used. See ''Catch a Falling Star'', p. 142</ref> played a small role in producing the celebrated [[Feynman Lectures on Physics]] by converting the taped audio of [[Richard Feynman]]'s lectures to prose. Caltech afforded Clayton the chance to meet and later become a lifelong friend of [[Fred Hoyle]], British cosmologist and creator of the theory of nucleosynthesis in stars. Hoyle exerted strong lifetime influence on Clayton. Clayton's published collaborations with Fowler (1983 Nobel Laureate in Physics) as Fowler's<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald D. |last=Clayton |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFN4srk0bnsC&lpg=PT162&pg=PT179 |title=Catch a Falling Star |chapter=S Process and my Journeyman's Rating |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> research student (1957\u201360) and subsequently as Fowler's post-doctoral research associate (1961\u201363) launched Clayton's scientific career.\n\nHe established himself at Caltech as a new worker in the field of [[nucleosynthesis]] in stars by calculating the first time-dependent models of both the [[s process]] and the fast neutron-capture chains of the [[r process]] of heavy-element nucleosynthesis and of the nuclear abundance quasiequilibrium that establishes the highly radioactive abundances between silicon and nickel during silicon burning in stars. He came onto the field early, when nucleosynthesis was a vibrant, modern frontier. Citations are in the Nucleosynthesis section below.\n\n==Academic history==\nA historic connection of Clayton's academic career to NASA's Apollo Program arose  arose through establishment by Rice University of its Department of Space Science in 1963. This action by Rice University provided the academic position assumed by Clayton in 1963. Clayton described this good fortune in his autobiography<ref>p. 159-163, ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref>. His academic research into five fields of astrophysics championed by him is detailed in section 5 below. Foundational academic positions at Caltech, Rice University and Clemson University were augmented by international breadth: seven-year-long academic affiliations in Cambridge (1967\u20131974) and later in Heidelberg (1976\u201382),<ref>Clayton, p. 178, Chapters 10 and 15 of his autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> as well as by visiting summer positions in Cardiff UK (1976, 1977)<ref>Chap. 15, p.369 of Clayton's autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> as well as sabbatical leaves in Cambridge (1971), Heidelberg (1981) and Durham University UK (1987).<ref>p. 439\u2013442, autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref>\n\nFollowing his two-year (1961\u201363) postdoctoral research fellowship at Caltech, Clayton was awarded an Assistant Professorship, one of the four founding faculty members in [[Rice University]]'s newly created Department of Space Science (later renamed Space Physics and Astronomy). There he initiated  a graduate-student course explaining nuclear reactions in stars as the mechanism for the creation of the atoms of our chemical elements. His pioneering textbook based on that course (''Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis'', McGraw-Hill 1968) earned ongoing praise. In 2018, 50 years after its first publication, it is still in common usage<ref>University of Chicago Press, reprint edition 1983</ref> in graduate education throughout the world. At Rice Clayton was awarded the newly endowed Andrew Hays Buchanan Professorship of Astrophysics in 1968 and held that endowed professorship for twenty years until responding to the opportunity to guide a new astrophysics program at [[Clemson University]] in 1989. During the 1970s at Rice University Clayton guided Ph.D. theses of many research students who achieved renown, especially [[Stanford E. Woosley]], William Michael Howard, H. C. Goldwire, Richard A. Ward, Michael J. Newman, Eliahu Dwek, Mark Leising and Kurt Liffman. Senior thesis students at Rice University included Bradley S. Meyer and Lucy Ziurys, both of whom forged distinguished careers in the subjects of those senior theses. Historical photos of several students can be seen on Clayton' s photo archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/index.html |title=Photo Archive In Nuclear Astrophysics: Photo List |publisher=Clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref>. Clayton followed the historic Apollo 11 mission while on holiday with his family in Ireland while traveling to Cambridge UK for his third research summer there.\n\nLetters in  winter 1966 from W.A. Fowler unexpectedly invited Clayton to return to Caltech in order to coauthor a book on [[nucleosynthesis]] with Fowler and Fred Hoyle. In his autobiography Clayton quotes these letters.<ref>{{cite book |first=Donald D. |last=Clayton |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFN4srk0bnsC&pg=PT215 |title=Catch a Falling Star |chapter=Getting the Call |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=9781440161032}}</ref> He accepted that offer but the book was never written because while he was resident at Caltech Clayton was invited by Fred Hoyle to [[Cambridge University]] (UK) in spring 1967 to advise a research program in nucleosynthesis at Hoyle's newly created [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]]. The award to Clayton of an [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation]] Fellowship (1966\u201368) facilitated leaves of absence from Rice University for this purpose. Clayton exerted that research leadership in Cambridge during 1967-72 by bringing his research students from Rice University with him. That prolific period ended abruptly by Hoyle's unexpected resignation from Cambridge University in 1972.<ref>Fred Hoyle, ''Home is where the wind blows'' (University Science Books, Mill Valley CA 1994) p. 372-376</ref> Clayton was during these years a Visiting Fellow of [[Clare Hall, Cambridge|Clare Hall]]. At Rice University W.D. Arnett, S.E. Woosley, and W.M. Howard published jointly numerous innovative studies with Clayton on the topic of explosive [[supernova]] nucleosynthesis.<ref>W. David Arnett & Donald D. Clayton, \"Explosive nucleosynthesis in stars\", ''Nature'' 227, pp. 780-784 (1970); Woosley, S.E, Arnett, W.D., Clayton, D.D., \"Explosive burning of oxygen and silicon\", ''Astrophys. Journal'' Supplement 26, 231\u2013312 (1973)</ref> During his Cambridge years, Clayton proposed<ref>Clayton, S. Colgate and G. Fishman, Astrophysical Journal 155, 75 (1969); Clayton and J. Silk, ''Astrophysical Journal'' 158, L43 (1969)</ref> radioactive gamma-ray-emitting nuclei as nucleosynthesis sources for the field of [[gamma-ray astronomy]] of line transitions from radioactive nuclei with coauthors  ([[Stirling Colgate]], [[Gerald J. Fishman]], and [[Joseph Silk]]). Detection of these gamma-ray lines two decades later provided the decisive proof that [[iron]] had been synthesized explosively in supernovae in the form of radioactive [[nickel]] isotopes rather than as iron itself, which Fowler and Hoyle had both advocated.\n\nDuring (1977\u201384) Clayton resided part-time annually at the [[Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics]] in [[Heidelberg]] as [[Humboldt Prize]] awardee, sponsored by Till Kirsten. Annual academic leaves from Rice University facilitated this. There he joined the [[Meteoritical Society]] seeking audience for his newly published theoretical picture<ref>\u201cExtinct radioactivities: Trapped residuals of pre-solar grains\u201d, ''Astrophys. J.'', 199, 765\u201369, (1975); \u201c22Na, Ne-E, Extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar\u201d, Nature, 257, 36-37, (1975); \u201cCosmoradiogenic ghosts and the origin of Ca-Al-rich inclusions\u201d, Earth and Planetary Sci.

He hoped that such interstellar grains could be discovered within [[meteorites]];<ref>Clayton, ''Catch a falling star'', op cit, p. 354\u201357, p. 387\u2013395</ref> and he also advanced a related theory that he called ''cosmic chemical memory''<ref>Cosmic chemical memory: a new astronomy (1981 George Darwin Lecture of the RAS), QJRAS 23, 174-212 (1982)</ref> by which the effects of stardust can be measured in meteoritic minerals even if stardust itself no longer exists there. Clayton designated the crystalline component of interstellar dust that had condensed thermally from hot and cooling stellar gases by a new scientific name, ''stardust''. Stardust became an important component of [[cosmic dust]]. Clayton has described<ref>Chapter 14 of his autobiography ''Catch a Falling Star''</ref> the stiff resistance encountered from meteoriticist referees of his early papers advancing this new theory. He nonetheless established that research program at Rice University, where he continued guiding graduate-student research on that topic. He and student Kurt Liffman computed a pathbreaking history of survival rates of refractory stardust in the interstellar medium after its ejection from stars;<ref>Stochastic histories of refractory interstellar dust, ''Proceedings Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 18, 637-657 (1988); Astrophys. J. 340, 853-868 (1989)</ref> and with student Mark D. Leising computed a propagation model of positron annihilation lines within nova explosions<ref>Astrophys.

J. 294, 591-598 (1985)</ref> Following laboratory discovery in 1987 of meteoritic  ''stardust'' bearing unequivocal isotopic markers of stars, Clayton was awarded the 1991 [[Leonard Medal]], the highest honor of the Meteoritical Society. Feeling vindicated,<ref>Clayton's own words in ''Catch a falling star'' op cit attest to his sense of vindication over this issue:(1) ''The telephone rings in s-process stardust'', p 400-401; (2)\"Comic battle over the Leonard Medal'', p. 489\u2013491</ref> Clayton exulted in ''Nature'' \"the human race holds solid samples of supernovae in its hands and studies them in terrestrial laboratories\".<ref>Donald D. Clayton, Nature 404, 329 (2000)</ref>\n\nIn 1989 Clayton accepted a professorship at Clemson University to develop a graduate research program in astrophysics there.<ref>''Catch a Falling Star'', Chap. 18</ref> He began this academic segment (1989\u2013present) by hiring three talented young astrophysicists <ref>Mark Leising, Dieter Hartmann and Bradley S. Meyer: ''Catch a Falling Star'' photo p. 494</ref> to vitalize joint research with the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (launched in 1991 after several delays). Its four  instruments successfully detected gamma-ray lines identifying several of the radioactive nuclei that Clayton had predicted to be present in supernova remnants. Clayton had been designated ten years earlier Co-Investigator on the NASA proposal submitted by James Kurfess for the Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment [[OSSE]], one of the four successful instruments carried into orbit by [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']], and he carried that research contract to Clemson. Simultaneously Clayton developed at Clemson his stardust research, introducing annual workshops for its researchers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://presolar.wustl.edu/Laboratory_for_Space_Sciences/Presolar_Grain_Workshop_2012.html |title=Presolar Grain workshop 2012 |publisher=Presolar.wustl.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> The initial NASA-sponsored workshop at Clemson in 1990 was so lively that it was repeated the following year jointly with [[Washington University (St. Louis)]] cosponsorship, and in later years cosponsored also by the [[University of Chicago]] and by the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]. These workshops featured the excitement of new isotopic discoveries, and also helped participants focus their ideas for submission of abstracts to NASA's Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Otherwise participants' workshop discussions were not shared or publicized.\n\nEventually a unique new goal became to assemble from his large personal collection of photographs a web-based archive for the history of nuclear astrophysics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/index.html |title=Photo Archive In Nuclear Astrophysics |publisher=Clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}</ref> and to donate the original photographs<ref>[https://photos.aip.org/taxonomy/term/253]</ref> to the Center for the History of Physics<ref>Center for History of Physics is a wing of American Institute of Physics. It can be reached on the web at aip.org and clicking on History Programs</ref> The thrusts of Clayton's career at Clemson University are well represented on that Photo Archive by photos between 1990 and 2014. Following his retirement from academic duties in 2007, Clayton remained quite active in research problems involving condensation of dust within supernovae<ref>Donald Clayton & Bradley S.

In 1989 he resigned to accept an offer from Clemson University in South Carolina to guide the establishment of a research program in astrophysics. Clemson University had launched an effort to move into the top 20 of public universities, and Clayton's hire was part of that plan. He resides with Nancy in historic G. W. Gignilliat House (1898) in [[Seneca, South Carolina]] (pop. 8,000), seven miles from the city of [[Clemson, South Carolina|Clemson]]. They jointly have one son who grew up in that house, Andrew, born in 1987 in [[Houston]]. Clayton's three previous children arose from his earlier marriages. A son (Donald Douglas Clayton b.1960, Pasadena CA) lives in Houston and a daughter (Alia Clayton Fisher, b. 1977, Houston) lives with her husband and four children in [[Longmont, Colorado]]. Another son, Devon Clayton (b. 1961 Pasadena), died in 1996 in Seneca SC. Clayton has one brother (d. 1980) and two sisters living in [[Texas]], two of whom were also born in [[Iowa]]. Clayton's mother and father had both been born on family farms in Fontanelle IA to parents <ref>''Catch a Falling Star'', p. 6-9</ref> who had lived their entire lives on Fontanelle farms. Their own parents had immigrated to Iowa near 1850 from England and Germany. Two of Clayton's great grandfathers (Kembery and Clayton) fought in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] (North). Robert M. Clayton fought in Sherman's Army at the battle of Atlanta.<ref>National Archives, Muster Roll, 43rd Company, Army of Ohio Infantry</ref>\n\nWhile at Rice University Clayton was introduced by patron of the arts [[Dominique de Menil]] to Italian filmmaker [[Roberto Rossellini]], and they jointly conceived of a film about one scientist's deepening realizations during a cosmological life, a sequence of experiences which Clayton proposed <ref>p. 245\u2013249 in ''Catch a Falling Star''. The wiki article on [[Dominique de Menil]] documents the interaction of the de Menils with Rosselini through the Rice University Media Center</ref> to provide for that project. In summer 1970 Clayton spent two weeks in Rome working daily with Rosselini <ref name=\"clemson.edu\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/70Clayton.html|title=PHOTO ARCHIVE IN NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS|publisher=Clemson.edu|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> on that effort, which failed owing to insufficient financial support or to insufficiently theatrical plan.<ref>No documentation exists for this failure, so this conclusion is based on Clayton's memory of it in his autobiography</ref> Clayton's published early memoir ''The Dark Night Sky: a personal adventure in cosmology''<ref>Quadrangle/The New York Times Book Co. (1975): A book columnist for the ''Washington Post'' wrote on March 21, 1976: \"Altogether more personal (than other books on cosmology that he was reviewing), ''The Dark Night Sky'' alternates cosmology with affable reminiscence. Clayton knows the rapture of astronomy and uses it to shuttle engagingly back and forth between Copernicus, Einstein, Stonehenge, the Milky Way and punts on Cambridge's Cam. A brooding, ecumenical enthusiast, Clayton dreads the vacant interstellar spaces as much as he loves galaxies, Texas, and the maple tree he planted a quarter of a century ago. His is a book of brainy charm\"</ref> laid out his plan for that film.\n\n==Citations of seminal research==\nClayton's research innovations in astrophysics and planetary science lay in five disciplines that have been largely introduced above; but the five sections here provide more details and more complete citations to his work for readers wanting more information. Clayton's own history of each topic as described within his autobiography, ''Catch a Falling Star'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonstarcatcher.com|title=Donald D. Clayton|publisher=Claytonstarcatcher.com|accessdate=20 September 2014}}</ref> is given at the end of each section. The references are to Clayton's noteworthy published papers. Clayton's independent style produced an unusual 120 single-author research papers, a relatively large number for astrophysicists.\n\n===Nuclear physics origin of the chemical elements ([[Nucleosynthesis]])===\nTrained at Caltech as a nuclear physicist by Wm. A. Fowler, Clayton was well positioned to consider interactions of heavy nuclei with neutrons. These were believed by Fowler to govern the nucleosynthesis of nuclei heavier than iron. Clayton established that theory by calculations of the isotopic abundances of heavier elements produced by neutron irradiation of iron in stars for both the slow neutron capture [[S-process]] and the rapid neutron capture [[R-process]] of heavy-element [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] (processes first defined by [[B2FH|B<sup>2</sup>FH]]<ref>Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler & Hoyle RMP 29, 547 (1957)</ref>). Clayton's two papers in 1961 and 1965 on those topics demonstrated that the solar-system abundances had been created not by a single neutron irradiation but as superpositions of abundance patterns established in presolar stars by differing neutron irradiations.<ref>[Donald D. Clayton,W.A. Fowler, T. Hull & B.Zimmerman\"Neutron Capture Chains in Heavy Element Synthesis\" Annals of Physics, 12, 331-408 (1961); Phillip A. Seeger, Donald D. Clayton and W. A. Fowler \"Nucleosynthesis of Heavy Elements by Neutron Capture\" Ap. J. Suppl. 11, 121-166 (1965)]</ref> His 1961 calculations of s-process abundance patterns, achieved by mathematical analysis rather than by not-yet-mature digital computation, established Clayton as a nucleosynthesis theorist. They also provided a ''standard model'' for the s process abundance patterns<ref>Clayton published subsequent papers on the mathematical properties of that standard model, each bearing the title ''s-process studies'', followed by a specific subtitle. Those papers and their subtitles were: \"exact solution to a chain having two distinct cross section values\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 192, 501 (1974 with M.J. Newman; \"exact evaluation of an exponential distribution of exposures\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 193, 397 (1974) with R.A. Ward; \"Branching and the time scale\", ''Astrophys. J. Suppl.'' 31, 35 (1976) with R.A. Ward and M. J. Newman; \"Xenon and krypton isotopic abundances\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 224, 1000 (1978) with R. A. Ward; \"s-process studies in the light of new experimental cross section: distribution of neutron fluences and r-process residuals\", ''Astrophys. J.'' 257, 821 (1982) with F. Kaeppeler, H. Beer, K. Wisshak, R.L. Macklin and R. A. Ward</ref> that guided four decades of progress on the s process abundances and on derived characteristics of the r-process abundances. In 1967 Clayton turned to the supernova origin of the abundances of elements that can be created in stars from hydrogen and helium alone. Those so-called ''primary nucleosynthesis'' nuclei having atomic weights between silicon and nickel (A=28-62) are very abundant. To understand their dramatic alternating abundances he tested a new conceptual idea that he named ''nuclear quasiequilibrium during silicon burning''<ref name=\"D. Bodansky. D.D 1968\"/> The quasiequilibrium concept did explain the observed numbers of isotopes in the A=28-62 mass range, which had previously been unsolved.<ref>/ The B<sup>2</sup>FH review \"Synthesis of the Elements in Stars\" RMP 29, 547 (1957) had little correct to say in explanation of primary nucleosynthesis in this mass region. The highly acclaimed B<sup>2</sup>FH review focussed more on isotopes that can be converted in stars to other isotopes, the so-called ''secondary processes''</ref> Nuclear quasiequilibrium was at that time the grandest advance in theory of primary nucleosynthesis in supernovae since Hoyle's 1954 paper, whose focus it validated. Of extreme importance was its demonstration that supernova silicon burning should become profoundly radioactive because rapid quasiequilibrium between atomic weights A=44-62 is overwhelmingly of radioactive nuclei.<ref>Phys. Rev.Letters 20, 161 (1968); Astrophys. J. 16,299 (1968)</ref> Clayton's recent description in 2016 in terms of a ''secondary supernova machine'' of this important process with B. S. Meyer<ref>Donald D. Clayton & B.S. Meyer, \"The Secondary Supernova Machine: Gravitational Compression, Stored Coulomb Energy, and SNII Displays\", ''New Astronomy Reviews'' 71, 1-8 (2016)</ref> clarified that the intense radioactivity resulted from supernova shock waves forcing excess Coulomb energy into those nuclei.\n\nAbundant radioactivity is widely regarded as Clayton's most important discovery for astronomy because it controls the late luminosity of supernovae. Quasiequilibrium demanded that even the mountain-like abundance peak at iron was synthesized as radioactive nickel parents <sup>56</sup>[[nickel|Ni]] and <sup>57</sup>[[nickel|Ni]] in the supernovae explosions rather than as iron directly<ref>D.Clayton, S. Colgate & G, Fishman, ''Astrophys. J.'' 155, 75 (1969); S. Woosley, W. Arnett & D. Clayton, ''Astrophys. J. Suppl''. 26, 231\u2013312 (1973). See Radioactive Progenitors  on p. 286\u201387</ref> as Hoyle and Fowler maintained. This discovery ignited Clayton's long and productive focus with radioactive isotopes ejected from supernovae, leading to his predictions of both gamma-ray line astronomy<ref>D.Clayton, S. Colgate & G, Fishman, ''Astrophys. J.'' 155, 75 (1969); D. Clayton, ''Astrophys. J.'' 188, 155 (1974); D. Clayton, ''Astrophys. J.'' 198, 151 (1975)</ref> and of radioactive supernova grains condensed from hot supernova gases<ref>D. Clayton, A''strophys. J.'' 199, 765 (1975); D. Clayton, ''Nature'' 257,36 (1975); D. Clayton, ''Moon & Planets'' 19, 109 (1978)</ref> Experimental confirmation two decades later of both predictions spurred those new fields of astronomy and brought Clayton high honors. At Rice University a prolific 1970\u201374 with colleagues W. David Arnett, Stanford E. Woosley and W.Michael Howard explored other explosive nucleosynthesis caused by the radially outgoing supernova shock wave.<ref>[Explosive nucleosynthesis in stars, W.D. Arnett & D.D.

Supplement Series'', 26, 231\u2013312, (1973)]</ref> Leadership of nucleosynthesis seems to have shifted by 1975 to Rice University.\n\nDuring 1967-72 Clayton resided half time in Cambridge U.K. at Hoyle's invitation<ref>''Catch a Falling Star'' Chapter 10, p.210</ref> to import and advise nucleosynthesis research at Hoyle's newly constructed Institute of Theoretical Astronomy. Clayton did this by bringing his graduate students at Rice with him to Cambridge. After Hoyle's abrupt 1972 resignation from Cambridge Hoyle made three research visits with Clayton at Rice University.<ref>http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/73HC_Rice.html shows photographs of Hoyle and Clayton at work in Houston.</ref><ref>http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/75letterHC.html</ref> After Clayton's 1989 move to Clemson University, his research with Bradley S. Meyer showed how the uniquely puzzling <sup>48</sup>[[calcium|Ca]] isotope of calcium had become so abundant in the Galaxy<ref>B. S. Meyer & D.D. Clayton, \"48Ca Production in Matter expanding from High Temperature and Density\" ''Astrophys. J.'' 462, 825 (1996); Meyer, Krishnan & Clayton, ''Astrophys. J. Suppl.'' 26, 231-312 (1973)</ref> owing to a relatively rare form of Type Ia supernovae in which the appropriate neutron-enriched quasiiequilibrium nucleosynthesis occurs. They subsequently explained why the minor <sup>95</sup>[[molybdenum|Mo]] and <sup>97</sup>[[molybdenum|Mo]] isotopes of the element molybdenum had become dominant in supernovae stardust<ref>B.S. Meyer & D. D, Clayton, ''Astrophys.J.'', 540, L49\u201352 (2000)</ref> explaining an experimental riddle in stardust isotopic abundances.\n\nClayton began in 2000 a spirited prose description of isotopic nucleosynthesis<ref>''Handbook of Isotopes in the Cosmos'' Cambridge University Press 2003</ref> in order to increase its accessibility both to laymen and to scientists conducting isotopic analyses of stardust. Becoming increasingly disappointed at the same time that Hoyle's theory of primary nucleosynthesis in massive stars was being overlooked and forgotten after he fell into science disfavor over his views on interstellar biology, Clayton published two historical papers reestablishing community consciousness of Hoyle's pioneering achievement.<ref>Donald D.Clayton  \"Hoyle\u2019s Equation\" ''Scienc''e 318, 1876\u201377 (2007); Donald D. Clayton \"Fred Hoyle, primary nucleosynthesis and radioactivity\" ''New Astronomy Reviews'' 52, 360\u201363 (2008). Younger scientists who never knew Hoyle were overlooking what his 1954 paper had achieved</ref> See chapters 7, 9 and 18 of Clayton's life in ''Catch a Falling Star''.\n\n===Gamma-ray-line astronomy of radioactive nuclei in supernovae===\nClayton, Colgate and Fishman's 1969 prediction that motivated pursuing gamma-ray-line astronomy <ref name=\"Clayton, Colgate 1969\"/> as an empirical test of supernova nucleosynthesis was recognized in the American Astronomical Society Centennial Volume <ref name=\"clemson1\"/> as one of the 50 most influential astrophysics papers of the 20th century. Observational discovery of those gamma rays would later confirm explosive nucleosynthesis theory and cement mankind's understanding of the profoundly radioactive nature of supernovae.  It is  the innovation for which Clayton is best known. His NASA-funded research at Rice University during the 1970s sought after additional nuclear prospects<ref name=\"Donald Clayton pp. 401\u2013426\">Donald Clayton, \"Cosmic radioactivity: a gamma-ray search for the origins of atomic nuclei, in ''ESSAYS IN NUCLEAR ASTROPHYSICS'', Barnes, Clayton & Schramm, eds., pp. 401\u2013426 (Cambridge University Press, 1982)</ref> for that high-energy spectroscopic astronomy, which is based on the recognizable energies of gamma rays emitted by individual radioactive nuclei that had recently been ejected from supernovae. Today it has blossomed with many observational results after quickly becoming a goal for future space astronomy missions, especially at a time when [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] was being proposed to NASA in 1977 (launched by [[Space Shuttle Atlantis]] in 1991). Hopes were suddenly raised for a detectable source when in 1987 optical astronomers discovered a nearby supernova called [[SN1987A]] in the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]]. Clayton described those hopes from his 1987 sabbatical-year office at Durham University UK as a mounting excitement generated by observed X-ray emission from its supernova surface.<ref>\"Hard X rays imply more to come\", ''Nature'' 330, 423 (1987)</ref> His research with L-S The augmented understanding of those hard X-rays and their derivation from the radioactivity gamma rays permeating supernova interiors.<ref>[Clayton & The \"Bremmsstrahlung and Energetic Electrons in Supernovae\" (1991) ApJ, 375, 221]</ref> Supernova 1987A gamma-ray-line emission did yield exciting first detections of those gamma-ray lines from <sup>56</sup>[[cobalt|Co]]<ref>\"Gamma-ray line emission from SN1987A\", S.M.

Letters, 399, L137 (1992)</ref> (by [[OSSE]] with Clayton a coauthor) thereby establishing this field of astronomy.  [[CGRO]], the space gamma-ray telescope mission that detected several predicted gamma-ray lines, was the second mission of NASA\u2019s Great Observatories program.\n\nIn 1977 at Rice University Clayton had been named ''Co-Investigator'' for the NASA-approved proposal for the [[OSSE]] spectrometer on CGRO, and in 1982 he  summarized physical expectations for several gamma-ray-line emitting young nuclei.<ref name=\"Donald Clayton pp. 401\u2013426\"/> Key to the intense supernova radioactivity had been Clayton's 1967 discovery that rapid-silicon-burning was dominated by abundances of radioactive alpha-particle nuclei (those having equal numbers of protons and neutrons<ref>''Phys. Rev. Lett.'' 20, 161 (1968); Principles of Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, Chap. 7 (1968); \"Explosive Burning of Oxygen and Silicon\" Astrophys. J.

Supernova 1987A ejected 20,000 times the mass of the earth<ref>Donald D.

J., 142, 189-200, 1965]</ref> but r-process nuclei are much less abundant in supernovae than are the nuclei fused during silicon-burning. So it was the latter that became the demonstrated source of radioactive nuclei.  Chapters 8, 11, 17 and 18 in ''Catch a Falling Star'', whose title Clayton has said he chose as an allusion to the gravitational core collapse that triggers these supernovae.\n\n===Astronomy of ''Stardust''===\nClayton introduced the idea that the relative abundances of the isotopes in tiny solid dust grains that condensed within hot gas leaving individual stars would be observable in such single dust grains. Those grains reveal the isotopic composition of their parent stars. He named these solids ''stardust'',<ref>Precondensed Matter: Key to the Early Solar System, ''Moon & Planets'' 19, 109 (1978)</ref> postulating thereby a new component of interstellar [[Cosmic dust]]. ''Stardust'' inherits its unusual isotopic compositions from the evolved nuclear composition of the parent star within which that grain condensed. Clayton's initial steps<ref>[ \u201cExtinct radioactivities: Trapped residuals of pre-solar grains\u201d, Astrophys. J., 199, 765-69, (1975); \u201c22Na, Ne-E, Extinct radioactive anomalies and unsupported 40Ar\u201d, Nature, 257, 36-37, (1975)</ref> focused on large isotopic excesses in supernova dust grains owing to decays of abundant short-lived radioactive nuclei that were created in the nuclear explosion and then condensed within a few months in the cooling ejecta; but it was generalized to all types of stellar mass loss in 1978.<ref>Donald D.

He described stardust as a ubiquitous component within interstellar dust, a peppering of the interstellar medium. These papers initially encountered such incredulity in the field of cosmochemistry that most were rejected first and published only later;<ref>Chap. 14, \"Falling Stardust\", p. 299\u2013368 , ''Catch a Falling Star'' (iUniverse; New York 2009</ref> nonetheless, Robert Walker and Ernst Zinner at Washington University undertook instrumental development that would prove capable of measuring isotope ratios in such tiny solids.<ref name=\"D.

Those dramatic experimental discoveries in the 1990s, led primarily by Ernst Zinner (d.2015)<ref>Clayton and Zinner became close friends and colleagues. Clayton's obituary for Zinner appears in the February (2016) issue of PHYSICS TODAY.</ref> and his colleagues at Washington University (St. Louis),<ref>, but also by scientists in Chicago, Pasadena, and Mainz</ref> confirmed the stunning reality of this new type of astronomy; namely, solid interstellar dust particles that condensed within stellar gases long before the earth was created are today studied in laboratories on earth. These tiny stones are quite literally solid pieces of long dead stars. This was a revolutionary idea, endowing that experimental search with excitement. The discovery experiments dispelled skepticism surrounding Clayton's predictions, causing him to be awarded<ref name=\"clemson2\"/> the 1991 [[Leonard Medal]] of the [[Meteoritical Society]].

Reasoning that interstellar gas contains a higher concentrations of shorter-lived radioactive nuclei than do the stars, Clayton invented in 1985 new mathematical solutions for the simplified differential equations of galactic abundance evolution that for the first time rendered these relationships understandable,<ref>Donald Clayton, \u201cGalactic chemical evolution and nucleocosmochronology: A standard model\u201d, in ''Challenges and New Developments in Nucleosynthesis'', W.

Clayton then calculated an age of 13-15 billion years for the oldest galactic nuclei,<ref name=\"Mon. Notices Roy 1988\"/> which would necessarily approximate the long-sought age of our galaxy. More recently radioactive  cosmochronology has diminished in importance because more precise techniques for determining the age of the Milky Way have been discovered in the cosmic microwave background. Nonetheless, his analytic solutions demonstrated importantly that the concentration of short-lived radioactive nuclei in interstellar gas had routinely been underestimated by the factor (k+1), where k is an integer near 2 or 3 that measures the steepness of the rate of decline of the infall of pristine gas onto our growing galactic mass.<ref>[Donald D.

These are called the ''extinct radioactivities'' because none remain on earth today but which did leave clear evidence of their prior existence in meteorites. Solution for a model history for the origin of our solar system that simultaneously fits their residual abundances became the guiding principle for a new discipline that focuses on local ''extra'' nucleosynthesis near the solar interstellar cloud during the billion years preceding solar birth.<ref>[\u201cShort-lived Radioactivities and the Birth of the Sun\u201d, B.S. Meyer & D.D. Clayton, ''Space Science Revs''., 92, 133\u2013152 (2000)]</ref> In 1983, at a time when astrophysicists relied for simplicity on a well mixed interstellar gas,  Clayton introduced a new related aspect of the interstellar medium<ref>Donald D. Clayton, \u201cExtinct radioactivities: A three-phase mixing model\u201d, ''Astrophys. J.'', 268, 381-384,1983</ref> that has proven to be essential for understanding the abundances of the extinct radioactivities; namely the time required for isotopic mixing between freshly synthesized atoms ejected from supernovae with distinct physical phases of interstellar gas. He showed that because those time delays allowed more interstellar decay of radioactive nuclei, each phase of interstellar gas contains a distinctly different concentration of each of the extinct radioactive nuclides, whereas the early solar system radioactivities measure only those abundances present in the dense molecular-cloud phase<ref>\u201cExtinct radioactivities: A three-phase mixing model\u201d, D.

Aspects of interstellar-phase mixing are sure to remain important for decades to come while astronomers probe the circumstances of solar birth using accurate meteoritic data revealing the abundances of the extinct radioactive nuclei. Clayton therefore gave emphasis to ''extinct radioactivity'' in the Glossary of his 2003 book on isotopes in the cosmos.<ref>Donald Clayton, ''Handbook of isotopes in the cosmos'', Cambridge University Press 2003), p.285\u2013289</ref> Chapters 16 and 17 of ''Catch a Falling Star''.\n\n===Condensation of carbon solids from oxygen-rich supernova gas===\nIn 1998 Clayton voiced a new idea for supernova chemistry by arguing that radioactive decay causes carbon to condense within oxygen-rich supernova gas. He reached that conclusion after Weihong Liu and Alexander Dalgarno<ref>W. Liu & A. Dalgarno, ''Astrophys. J.'' 454, 472\u201379 (1995)</ref> showed that radioactive decays of <sup>56</sup>[[cobalt|Co]] create fast Compton-scattered electrons that would dissociate the CO molecule [e+CO > e'+C+O], thereby preventing the complete oxidation of carbon atoms within young remnants of core-collapse supernovae. Clayton initiated an energetic crusade in 1998<ref>D. D. Clayton, \"Condensing carbon SUNOCONs when O>C\", ''Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 29 (1998); D Clayton, W Liu & A Dalgarno \u201cCondensation of Carbon in Radioactive Supernova Gas\u201d, ''Science'' 283, 1290\u20131292 (1999); W Liu & D Clayton, \"Condensation of carbon in supernovae: 1. Basic Chemistry\" Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 30 (1999), and D. Clayton & W. Liu \"Condensation of Carbon in Supernovae 2. Graphite in meteorites\", ''Lunar and Planetary Science Conference'' 30 (1999)</ref> demonstrating that the vast reservoir of carbon in core-collapse supernovae must condense as carbon dust despite being bathed in more-abundant oxygen gas. This idea met skepticism from meteoriiticists and cosmochemists because it contradicted a commonly accepted rule of thumb that held that the abundance of carbon must exceed that of oxygen (written C>O) in order for carbon to condense. Clayton advocated that supernova carbon stardust (which in 1977 he had named<ref>Donald D. Clayton, \"Precondensed matter: Key to the early solar system\", ''Moon & Planets'' 19, 109(1978)</ref> ''SUNOCONs'', an acronym for SUperNOva CONdensates) could therefore assemble within hot supernova C+O gases containing more oxygen than carbon and nothing else. Rather than a specialist's chemical detail, this is a profound conclusion for astrophysics because it partly explains the large amounts of dust created by supernovae in the early universe. Meteoritic chemists to whom his 1998-99 Lunar and Planetary Science Conference papers were addressed  doubted that possibility on intuitive but erroneous chemical grounds, believing that abundant hot oxygen gas would oxidize all carbon atoms leaving them trapped within chemically inert CO molecules\u2014an expectation that holds true in ordinary stars. Clayton asserted that this incorrect chemical rule-of-thumb was erroneously biasing interpretive studies of carbon SUNOCONs (primarily SiC grains and graphite grains). With Lih-Sin The at Clemson he computed the large density of energetic electrons produced by scattering of gamma rays <ref>D.D. Clayton and L.S. The, ''Astrophys J.'', \"Bremmstrahlung and Energetic Electrons in Supernovae\", ''Ap.J.'' 375, 221-38 (1991)</ref> emitted by radioactive cobalt. Those continuously replenish the abundance of free carbon atoms in the supernova gas by breaking apart the abundant CO molecules. In the most recent of his papers, Clayton & Meyer (2017) <ref name=\"D.D.Clayton 2017\">D.D.Clayton & B. S. Meyer, \"Graphite Grain-Size Spectrum and Molecules from Core-Collapse Supernovae\", ''Geochimica et Cosmochimica Act''a (2017) doi:10.1016/j.gca.2017.06.027</ref> computed every reaction step from hot gas to cold grains during the cooling expansion of the supernova gas. Those quite abundant free carbon atoms enable carbon-chain molecules to maintain their small abundances against constant oxidation and later capture carbon atoms until they become macroscopic grains of carbon.<ref>[DD Clayton, W Liu & A Dalgarno, \u201cCondensation of Carbon in Radioactive Supernova Gas\u201d, ''Science''  283, 1290\u20131292 (1999); DD Clayton, E Deneault & BS Meyer ''Astrophysical Journal'' 562, 480\u2013493 (2001); E Deneault, DD Clayton & A Heger, \u201cSupernova Reverse Shocks: SiC growth and isotopic composition\u201d, ''Astrophys.

They played their 2007 home games out of  [[Hara Arena]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], but are more famous for playing as the '''Cincinnati Marshals''' at [[U.S. Bank Arena]] for two seasons. The Marshals played their 2004 inaugural season in Waco, Texas, as the Waco Marshals.\n\n[[File:Waco vs Beaumont 2.jpg|thumb|2004 Waco Marshals vs Beaumont Drillers]]\n\n[[File:Rome marshals2.jpg|thumb|2005 Cincinnati Marshals vs Rome Renegades]]\n\n==History==\nThe Marshals started out as the Waco Marshals in 2004, but finished their inaugural season with a disappointing 2-8 record. For the next season they relocated to Cincinnati and became the Cincinnati Marshals.\n\n==The 2004 season==\nThe NIFL took over operations midway through the 2004 season after realizing that the ownership had \"floated\" a phony check for the franchise and the league had to assume financial burden to a team that had never paid a penny to even join the league due to the fraudulent payment by ownership. The league then agreed to sell the rights to Tony Williams and Manuel Ramos, who was serving as the Defensive Coordinator and Special Teams Coordinator respectively, at the time. Williams and Ramos reign as owners didn't last much longer after it was found that they could not make payments either to the H.O.T. and had bounced employee paychecks, did not pay bills to companies for services and did not have the required insurance for the players; same as their predecessors. Several new players were signed, as the NIFL managed the Marshals for the remainder of the 2004 season.\n\n==The 2005 season==\nIn 2005 owner H. P. Patterson first surrendered the team after he did not pay players for well over a month, and then fled the United States entirely after being suspected of [[money laundering]]. The mismanagement resulted in the resignation of the team's coach, former [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] coach [[Ed Biles]], and the dissolution of the Diamond Deputies cheerleading squad, after they claimed weeks of unpaid game checks. In Addition, the Assistant Coach [[Hubbard Alexander]] and the Equipment Director Josh Reasoner followed Coach Biles out.\n\nDespite all this, new coach Tony Wells and quarterback Brett Dietz led the team to the finish of an 8-6 record, which tied them for 2nd in their division with the Dayton Warbirds. In the First round of playoffs they upset the River City Rage, who was ranked first in the same division as the Marshals with the Marshals with 67 points and the Rage with 64 points. In the next playoff round they defeated the Fayetteville Guard 70 to 69. In the Atlantic Conference Championship they had no such luck, falling to the Rome Renegades 51 to 41.\n\nFormer Cincinnati Marshals quarterback [[Brett Dietz]] played for many years in the [[Arena Football League]] and other indoor football leagues. He won Co-Rookie of the Year in the AFL for the 2007 season. The Marshals have been mentioned on [[ESPN]] when they talk about Dietz's career.\n\n==The 2006 season==\nIn the following months, the team's status was left largely undetermined. On December 20, 2005, after many months of speculation, the Marshals announced a return to the NIFL for the 2006 season with a new ownership group led by Doug Hortman and P.J. Conboy, a new coaching staff led by head coach Steve Carpenter and the return of the Diamond Deputies. The team matched their 2005 regular season output, going 8-6 in the season, and clinched the #5 seed in the Atlantic Conference playoffs.\n\n==2006 playoffs==\nThe Marshals could not avoid the game of \"musical teams\" that seemed to doom the league (the consequence of a failed expansion project) even before the playoffs began. Cincinnati's 5th seed was supposed to equal a road trip to a rematch of a late-season loss to Osceola. Osceola, however, commenced a tug-of-war with the league and the Marshals regarding the site of the game. Osceola's home arena was hosting a rodeo the weekend of the first round, and asked Cincinnati to host the game. However, Cincinnati had been thrown out of their arena due to setup for a concert. Osceola offered a compromise, where the Marshals would travel to Lakeland, Florida, but team ownership shot down the idea and forfeited the game.\n\nA few days after the announced forfeit, it was revealed that Osceola failed to file paperwork so they could advance into the playoffs. Osceola was given a choice: either play Cincinnati in St. Louis with the winner playing the River City Rage the next night, or forfeit the game and allow Cincinnati to advance to play River City. Osceola declined, and Cincinnati was allowed to advance. With only three days and one practice to prepare for the game, Cincinnati traveled to St. Louis, where the Rage defeated the Marshals at Scottrade Center, 43-30, ending the Marshals' season.\n\n==The 2007 season==\nOn October 18, 2006, it was announced that the [[AF2]] had granted a new expansion team to the [[U.S. Bank Arena]], in the form of the [[Cincinnati Jungle Kats]], who took over the indoor football contract for the arena. As a consequence, the Marshals had no arena to call their own. It was originally thought that they were moving to [[Wall2Wall Soccer]] in nearby [[Mason, Ohio|Mason]] for 2007, [http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3390097].  However, they moved to [[Hara Arena]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] for 2007, and changing their name to '''The Marshals'''.  [http://www.niflfootball.com/content/show/49].\n\nThe announcement was even more of a shock to players and staff, seeing as no formal conference was given, no owner-team meeting was ever held, and all but owner Doug Hortman and his assistant were made to research the information through a short press release on a skeletal form of the Marshals website, leaving fans irate. The Marshals went quietly up to Dayton, a move similar to the 1983 overnight move of the Baltimore Colts to Indianapolis.\n\nThe 2007 season was played, but was not completed in full, due to the collapse of the NIFL. At the time the team was 2-4. Owner Doug Hortman was interviewed by the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'', in which he accused the NIFL of lying to him and other owners about league development and scheduling. Hortman would then go on to promise the return of the team for 2008, which proved to be a lie. This was the same promise Hortman had made when he announced during halftime of the final home game in 2006 that the team would return to Cincinnati in 2007.\n\nHowever, the promise was once again kept unfulfilled, and the team went away quietly, along with the rest of the NIFL.\n\n==Season-by-season==\n{{Start NFL SBS}}\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | '''Waco Marshals'''\n|-\n|2004 || 2 || 8 || 0 || 5th Atlantic Southern || --\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | '''Cincinnati Marshals'''\n|-\n|2005 || 8 || 6 || 0 || 3rd Atlantic Eastern || Won Atlantic Conference Quarter Final ([[River City Rage|River City]])<br>Won Atlantic Semi-Final ([[Fayetteville Guard|Fayetteville]])<br>Lost Atlantic Final ([[Rome Renegades|Rome]])\n|-\n|2006 || 8 || 6 || 0 || 2nd Atlantic Eastern || Won Atlantic Quarter Final ([[Osceola Football]]) (Forfeit)<br>Lost Atlantic Semi-Final ([[River City Rage|River City]])\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | '''The Marshals'''\n|-\n|2007 || 2 || 5 || 0 || 3rd Atlantic || --\n|-\n!Totals || 23 || 27 || 0\n|colspan=\"2\"| (including playoffs)\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Team history==\n\n===2005===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

The Marshals played their 2004 inaugural season in Waco, Texas, as the Waco Marshals.\n\n[[File:Waco vs Beaumont 2.jpg|thumb|2004 Waco Marshals vs Beaumont Drillers]]\n\n[[File:Rome marshals2.jpg|thumb|2005 Cincinnati Marshals vs Rome Renegades]]\n\n==History==\nThe Marshals started out as the Waco Marshals in 2004, but finished their inaugural season with a disappointing 2-8 record. For the next season they relocated to Cincinnati and became the Cincinnati Marshals.\n\n==The 2004 season==\nThe NIFL took over operations midway through the 2004 season after realizing that the ownership had \"floated\" a phony check for the franchise and the league had to assume financial burden to a team that had never paid a penny to even join the league due to the fraudulent payment by ownership. The league then agreed to sell the rights to Tony Williams and Manuel Ramos, who was serving as the Defensive Coordinator and Special Teams Coordinator respectively, at the time. Williams and Ramos reign as owners didn't last much longer after it was found that they could not make payments either to the H.O.T. and had bounced employee paychecks, did not pay bills to companies for services and did not have the required insurance for the players; same as their predecessors. Several new players were signed, as the NIFL managed the Marshals for the remainder of the 2004 season.\n\n==The 2005 season==\nIn 2005 owner H. P. Patterson first surrendered the team after he did not pay players for well over a month, and then fled the United States entirely after being suspected of [[money laundering]]. The mismanagement resulted in the resignation of the team's coach, former [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] coach [[Ed Biles]], and the dissolution of the Diamond Deputies cheerleading squad, after they claimed weeks of unpaid game checks. In Addition, the Assistant Coach [[Hubbard Alexander]] and the Equipment Director Josh Reasoner followed Coach Biles out.\n\nDespite all this, new coach Tony Wells and quarterback Brett Dietz led the team to the finish of an 8-6 record, which tied them for 2nd in their division with the Dayton Warbirds. In the First round of playoffs they upset the River City Rage, who was ranked first in the same division as the Marshals with the Marshals with 67 points and the Rage with 64 points. In the next playoff round they defeated the Fayetteville Guard 70 to 69. In the Atlantic Conference Championship they had no such luck, falling to the Rome Renegades 51 to 41.\n\nFormer Cincinnati Marshals quarterback [[Brett Dietz]] played for many years in the [[Arena Football League]] and other indoor football leagues. He won Co-Rookie of the Year in the AFL for the 2007 season. The Marshals have been mentioned on [[ESPN]] when they talk about Dietz's career.\n\n==The 2006 season==\nIn the following months, the team's status was left largely undetermined. On December 20, 2005, after many months of speculation, the Marshals announced a return to the NIFL for the 2006 season with a new ownership group led by Doug Hortman and P.J. Conboy, a new coaching staff led by head coach Steve Carpenter and the return of the Diamond Deputies. The team matched their 2005 regular season output, going 8-6 in the season, and clinched the #5 seed in the Atlantic Conference playoffs.\n\n==2006 playoffs==\nThe Marshals could not avoid the game of \"musical teams\" that seemed to doom the league (the consequence of a failed expansion project) even before the playoffs began. Cincinnati's 5th seed was supposed to equal a road trip to a rematch of a late-season loss to Osceola. Osceola, however, commenced a tug-of-war with the league and the Marshals regarding the site of the game. Osceola's home arena was hosting a rodeo the weekend of the first round, and asked Cincinnati to host the game. However, Cincinnati had been thrown out of their arena due to setup for a concert. Osceola offered a compromise, where the Marshals would travel to Lakeland, Florida, but team ownership shot down the idea and forfeited the game.\n\nA few days after the announced forfeit, it was revealed that Osceola failed to file paperwork so they could advance into the playoffs. Osceola was given a choice: either play Cincinnati in St. Louis with the winner playing the River City Rage the next night, or forfeit the game and allow Cincinnati to advance to play River City. Osceola declined, and Cincinnati was allowed to advance. With only three days and one practice to prepare for the game, Cincinnati traveled to St. Louis, where the Rage defeated the Marshals at Scottrade Center, 43-30, ending the Marshals' season.\n\n==The 2007 season==\nOn October 18, 2006, it was announced that the [[AF2]] had granted a new expansion team to the [[U.S. Bank Arena]], in the form of the [[Cincinnati Jungle Kats]], who took over the indoor football contract for the arena. As a consequence, the Marshals had no arena to call their own. It was originally thought that they were moving to [[Wall2Wall Soccer]] in nearby [[Mason, Ohio|Mason]] for 2007, [http://www.oursportscentral.com/services/releases/?id=3390097].  However, they moved to [[Hara Arena]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] for 2007, and changing their name to '''The Marshals'''.  [http://www.niflfootball.com/content/show/49].\n\nThe announcement was even more of a shock to players and staff, seeing as no formal conference was given, no owner-team meeting was ever held, and all but owner Doug Hortman and his assistant were made to research the information through a short press release on a skeletal form of the Marshals website, leaving fans irate. The Marshals went quietly up to Dayton, a move similar to the 1983 overnight move of the Baltimore Colts to Indianapolis.\n\nThe 2007 season was played, but was not completed in full, due to the collapse of the NIFL. At the time the team was 2-4. Owner Doug Hortman was interviewed by the ''[[Dayton Daily News]]'', in which he accused the NIFL of lying to him and other owners about league development and scheduling. Hortman would then go on to promise the return of the team for 2008, which proved to be a lie. This was the same promise Hortman had made when he announced during halftime of the final home game in 2006 that the team would return to Cincinnati in 2007.\n\nHowever, the promise was once again kept unfulfilled, and the team went away quietly, along with the rest of the NIFL.\n\n==Season-by-season==\n{{Start NFL SBS}}\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | '''Waco Marshals'''\n|-\n|2004 || 2 || 8 || 0 || 5th Atlantic Southern || --\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | '''Cincinnati Marshals'''\n|-\n|2005 || 8 || 6 || 0 || 3rd Atlantic Eastern || Won Atlantic Conference Quarter Final ([[River City Rage|River City]])<br>Won Atlantic Semi-Final ([[Fayetteville Guard|Fayetteville]])<br>Lost Atlantic Final ([[Rome Renegades|Rome]])\n|-\n|2006 || 8 || 6 || 0 || 2nd Atlantic Eastern || Won Atlantic Quarter Final ([[Osceola Football]]) (Forfeit)<br>Lost Atlantic Semi-Final ([[River City Rage|River City]])\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" align=\"center\" | '''The Marshals'''\n|-\n|2007 || 2 || 5 || 0 || 3rd Atlantic || --\n|-\n!Totals || 23 || 27 || 0\n|colspan=\"2\"| (including playoffs)\n{{s-end}}\n\n==Team history==\n\n===2005===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!
