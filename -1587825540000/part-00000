Practitioners of Buddhism can be found amongst the Sinhalese population as well as the Tamil population. Buddhism has been given the foremost place under Article 9 of the Constitution which can be traced back to an attempt to bring the status of Buddhism back to the status it enjoyed prior to being destroyed by colonialists. However, by virtue of Article 10 of the Sri Lankan constitution, religious rights of all communities are preserved. Sri Lanka is the traditionally oldest religious Buddhist country where Buddhist Aryan culture is protected and preserved.<ref>\"Census of Population and Housing of Sri Lanka, 2012 \u2013 [http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/CPH2011/Pages/Activities/Reports/FinalReport/Population/Table%20A4.pdf Table A4: Population by district, religion and sex]\" (PDF). Department of Census & Statistics, Sri Lanka.</ref> The island has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and learning since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century [[Common Era|BCE]] producing eminent scholars such as [[Buddhaghosa]] and preserving the vast [[P\u0101li Canon]]. Throughout most of its history, Sri Lankan kings have played a major role in the maintenance and revival of the Buddhist institutions of the island. During the 19th century, a modern Buddhist revival took place on the island which promoted Buddhist education and learning. There are around 6,000 Buddhist monasteries on Sri Lanka with approximately 15,000 monks.<ref name=Perera>Perera, HR, Buddhism in Sri Lanka A Short History, 2007, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/perera/wheel100.html</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Introduction of Buddhism===\n\nAccording to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles such as the ''[[Dipavamsa]]'', Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka in the third century BCE after the [[Third Buddhist council]] by [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Arhanth\u00e0 Mahinda thero]], son of Emperor [[Ashoka]], during the reign of [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]]. After the arrival of Arahantha Mahinda, he invited his sister Sangamitta Thera to bring a sapling of the [[Bodhi Tree]] (where Buddha was enlightened) to Sri Lanka and the first Buddhist monastery, monuments and monk were introduced. Among these, the [[Isurumuniya]] and the [[Vessagiriya]] remain important centers of worship. He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamaka [[cetiya]], the Jambukola [[vihara|vih\u0101ra]] and the Hatth\u0101lhaka vih\u0101ra and the refectory. The Pali Canon, having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first converted into writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE. Along with Mahinda came his sibling Sanghamitra. She gave the nun ordinace to women devotees.\n\n''Mahavamsa'' \u00a729{{sfn|McEvilley|2012|p=558}} records that during the rule of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] King [[Menander I]], a [[Yona]] head monk named [[Mahadharmaraksita]] led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \"the Greek city of Alasandra\" ([[Alexandria in the Caucasus]], around {{convert|150|km}} north of modern [[Kabul]], Afghanistan) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the [[Ruwanwelisaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], indicating that [[Greco-Buddhism]] contributed to early Sri Lankan Buddhism. See also the ''[[Milinda Panha]]''.\n\n===Center of Pali literature===\nAs a result of the work of [[Buddhaghosa]] and other compilers such as [[Dhammapala]], Sri Lanka developed a strong tradition of written textual transmission of the Pali Canon. The compilation of the [[Atthakatha]] (commentaries) along with the [[Nik\u0101ya]]s and other Pitakas were committed to writing for the first time in the [[Aluvihare Rock Temple]] during the first century BCE.<ref name=Perera /> Buddhist literature in Sinhalese also thrived and by 410, Sri Lankan monks traveled widely throughout India and Asia introducing their works.\n\n===Therav\u0101da subdivisions===\n\nOver much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three subdivisions of Therav\u0101da existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the three [[mahavihara]]s: [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya]], [[Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra]] and [[Jetavanaramaya]].<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\">Warder, A.K. ''Indian Buddhism''. 2000. p. 280</ref> The Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya was the first tradition to be established while Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra and Jetavanaramaya were established by monks who had broken away from the Maha Viharaya tradition.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\"/> According to A.K. Warder, the Indian [[Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]] established itself in Sri Lanka alongside the Theravadas into which they were later absorbed.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\"/> Northern regions of Sri Lanka also seem to have been ceded to sects from India at certain times.<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\"/>\n\nIn the 7th century, Xuanzang wrote of two major divisions of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka, referring to the Abhayagiri tradition as the \"Mahayana Sthaviras\" and the Mah\u0101vih\u0101ra tradition as the \"[[Hinayana]] Sthaviras.\"<ref>Baruah, Bibhuti. ''Buddhist Sects and Sectarianism.'' 2008. p. 53</ref> Abhayagiri appears to have been a center for Mahayana and [[Vajrayana]] teachings;<ref>\"Esoteric Buddhism in Southeast Asia in the Light of Recent Scholarship\" by Hiram Woodward. ''Journal of Southeast Asian Studies'', Vol. 35, No. 2 (Jun., 2004), p. 341</ref> Xuanzang writes, \"The Mah\u0101vih\u0101rav\u0101sins reject the Mah\u0101y\u0101na and practice the H\u012bnay\u0101na, while the Abhayagirivih\u0101rav\u0101sins study both H\u012bnay\u0101na and Mah\u0101y\u0101na teachings and propagate the ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka]]''.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From \u015a\u0101kyamuni to Early Mah\u0101y\u0101na.'' 2007. p. 121</ref>\n\nIn the 8th century, both Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism were being practiced in Sri Lanka and two Indian monks responsible for propagating Vajrayana Buddhism in China, [[Vajrabodhi]] and [[Amoghavajra]], visited the island during this time.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira. Groner, Paul. ''A History of Indian Buddhism: From \u015a\u0101kyamuni to Early Mah\u0101y\u0101na.'' 2007. pp. 125\u2013126</ref>\n\nIn Pali commentaries, terms used for the Mahayanins of Abhayagiri were Vaitulya, Vaipulya and Vaidalya. According to HR Perera, the Theravada commentaries considered them heretical and their doctrines included:\n{{quote|They held the view that the Buddha, having been born in the [[Tushita|Tusita heaven]], lived there and never came down to earth and it was only a created form that appeared among men. This created form and \u0100nanda, who learned from it, preached the doctrine. They also held that nothing whatever given to the Order bears fruit, for the Sangha, which in the ultimate sense of the term meant only the path and fruition, does not accept anything. According to them any human pair may enter upon sexual intercourse by mutual consent.<ref name=Perera />}}\n\n===Accounts of Chinese pilgrims===\n\nIn the 5th century, [[Faxian]] visited Sri Lanka and lived there for two years with the monks. Faxian obtained a [[Sanskrit]] copy of the [[Vinaya]] of the [[Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]] at the [[Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra]] c. 406. The Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya was then translated into Chinese in 434 by Buddhajiva and [[Zhu Daosheng]].<ref>Hsing Yun. ''Humanistic Buddhism.'' 2005. p. 163</ref> This translation of the Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya remains extant in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] as [[Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka]] 1421.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/files/k0895.html|title=The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalog (T 1421)}}</ref>\n\nThe 7th-century pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] first learned for several years at [[Nalanda]] and then intended to go to Sri Lanka to seek out further instruction. However, after meeting Sri Lankan monks in the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] capital who were refugees, he decided not to visit:\n{{quote|At the time of Hiuen Tsang's visit the capital was visited by 300 [[bhikkhu|Bhikshus]] of Ceylon who had left the island in consequence of [[famine]] and [[revolution]] there. On the pilgrim telling them of his intended visit to Ceylon for instruction, they told him that there were no Brethren there superior to them. Then the pilgrim discussed some [[Yogacara|Yoga]] texts with them and found that their explanations could not excel those given to him by [[\u015a\u012blabhadra]] at N\u0101land\u0101.{{sfn|Mookerji|1998|p=520}}}}\n\n===Decline and revival===\nFrom the 5th century to the eleventh century, the island of Sri Lanka saw continuous warfare between local kings, pretenders and foreign invaders such as the South Indian Chola and [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyan]] dynasties. This warfare saw the sacking of viharas and made the situation difficult for Buddhism.<ref name=Perera /> In 1070, [[Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa]] conquered the island and set about repairing the monasteries. The state of Sri Lankan Buddhism was so bad at this time that he could not find five bhikkhus in the whole island to ordain more monks and restore the monastic tradition; therefore, he sent an embassy to [[Burma]], which sent back several eminent elders with Buddhist texts.<ref name=Perera /> The king oversaw the ordination of thousands of monks. The royal reforming of Sri Lankan Buddhism continued under [[Parakramabahu I]] (c. 1153), who restored many stupas and monasteries. During this period, Sri Lankan Buddhist literature thrived once again and the three greats writers [[Mah\u0101kassapa Thera]] of [[Dimbulagala Raja Maha Vihara]], Moggallana Thera and [[S\u0101riputta Thera]] compiled Pali commentaries and [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|sub-commentaries]]. [[Parakramabahu II of Dambadeniya]] (from c. 1236) was a learned king and wrote several Sinhalese Buddhist texts.\n\n===Abolition of other Theravada traditions===\nBefore the 12th century, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiris and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiris as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira.

During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Burma and [[Thailand]].\n\n===Colonialism and Christianity===\n[[File:AMH-7013-KB Procession of monks on Ceylon.jpg|thumb|230px|Dutch painting of the Buddhist religious festival in Ceylon, c. 1672]]\nFrom the 16th century onwards, [[missionary|missionaries]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] colonizers of Sri Lanka have attempted to convert the local population to [[Christianity]]. The wars with the Portuguese and their allies weakened the Sangha. In 1592, [[Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy]] sought aid from Burma in order to ordain Buddhist monks on the island as there was hardly a single properly ordained monk left.<ref name=Perera /> From 1612 to 1658, the Dutch and the Portuguese fought over the island with the Sinhalese caught in the middle, the Dutch won and occupied the maritime sections of the island that had been occupied by the Portuguese until 1796 when they surrendered their territories to the British. The Dutch were less zealous than the Portuguese in their religious proselytizing though they still discriminated against Buddhists which were not allowed to register with the local authorities therefore many Sinhalese pretended to be Protestant.<ref name=Perera /> During this period many religiously inclined Sinhalese rulers of the interior such as [[Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy]] (1706\u20131739) and [[Sri Vijaya Rajasinha of Kandy]] (1739\u20131747) continued to patronize Buddhism, restoring temples and monasteries.\n\nIn the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as [[upasampada]], which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Thai Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by [[Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero]] during the reign of king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe.<ref>[http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items05/270405-2.html Weliwita Sri Saranankara Theroenerable Weliwita Sri Saranankara Mahathera], Dr. Daya Hewapathirane, Lankaweb</ref>\n\nIn 1813 the American Ceylon Mission (Protestant) was established in [[Jaffna]]. In 1815 a British army captured Kandy and deposed the Sinhalese king ending a line of Buddhist kings lasting 2301 years, they retained Sri Lanka until 1948. Like the Dutch, the British refused to register unbaptized infants and to accept non-Christian marriages. They also always preferred Christians in government administration. The British also supported various Christian missionary groups who established schools on the island. Education in these schools (which disparaged Buddhism) was a requirement for government office. Missionaries also wrote tracts in Sinhalese attacking Buddhism and promoting Christianity<ref name=Perera />\n\n===Buddhist revival===\n<!--\"Eight Precepts\" links here. If this section is renamed or removed, please adjust wikilink over there accordingly.-->\n[[File:Olcott and Buddhists.jpg|thumb|250px|Henry Olcott and Buddhists (Colombo, 1883).]]\nIn the 19th century, a national Buddhist movement began as a response to Christian proselytizing, and was empowered by the results of the [[Panadura]] debate between Christian priests and Buddhist monks such as [[Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera]] and [[Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera]] which was widely seen as a victory for the Buddhists.<ref>[http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local/buddhists-must-safeguard-religion-sangha-thera Buddhists must safeguard religion, Sangha \u2013 Thera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416202308/http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local%2Fbuddhists-must-safeguard-religion-sangha-thera |date=2015-04-16 }}, Daily News</ref> In 1880 [[Henry Steel Olcott]] arrived in Sri Lanka with [[Madame Blavatsky]] of the [[Theosophical Society]]; he had been inspired when he read about the Panadura debate and after learning about Buddhism converted to the religion. Olcott and the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders established the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1880, with the goal of establishing Buddhist schools (there were only three at the time, by 1940, there were 429 Buddhist schools on the island).<ref name=Perera /> The society also had its own publications to promote Buddhism; the Sinhalese newspaper, ''Sarasavisandarasa'', and its English counterpart, ''The Buddhist''. As a result of their efforts, [[Vesak]] became a public holiday, Buddhist registrars of marriage were allowed, and interest in Buddhism increased. Another important figure in the revival is [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], initially an interpreter for Olcott, who traveled around the island preaching and writing. After traveling to India, he established the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in 1891 whose goal was to revive Buddhism in India, and restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinara]].<ref name=\"maha\">[http://mahabodhisociety.com/ Maha Bodhi Society]</ref> His efforts saw the restoration of these sites and a renewal of interest in Buddhism among some Indians. The associations of the Buddhist revival also contributed much to the publication of Buddhist texts, and promotion of Buddhist scholarship. Revivalist Buddhist scholars include Sir [[D. B. Jayatilaka]], [[F. R. Senanayake]], [[Walisinghe Harischandra]] and [[W. A. de Silva]].<ref name=Perera /> Several Buddhist shrines were also rebuilt. Buddhist leaders were also active in the movement for Sri Lankan independence. Since independence, Buddhism has continued to thrive on the island. \n[[File:Zahntempel Kandy.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Temple of the Tooth]] was renovated during the Buddhist revival.]]\n\nThe Buddhist revival also resulted in Sinhala Buddhists carrying the torch of Buddhism and igniting it on foreign shores. Anagarika Dharmapala and [[Asoka Weeraratna]] are two such leading pioneers among many others. They pioneered the establishment of Buddhist Viharas in Europe. Anagarika Dharmapala founded the London Buddhist Vihara in 1926 while Asoka Weeraratna opened a new chapter for the spread of Buddhism in Germany and Europe by establishing the Berlin Buddhist Vihara in [[Paul Dahlke (Buddhist)|Dr. Paul Dahlke]]\u2019s Das Buddhistische Haus in 1957 with monks from Sri Lanka stationed on a long-term footing to spread the Dhamma. This was the first Theravada Buddhist Vihara in Germany and continental Europe.\n\nSince the Buddhist revival Sri Lanka has also been an important center of Western Buddhist scholarship. One of the first western bhikkhus, [[Nyanatiloka]] Mahathera studied in Sri Lanka, established the [[Island Hermitage]] there and ordained several western monks. Western monks who studied in the island hermitage such as [[Nanamoli Bhikkhu]] and Ven. [[Nyanaponika]] (who established the [[Buddhist Publication Society]] along with [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]]) were responsible for many important translations of the [[Pali Canon]] and other texts on Buddhism in English and German.\n\n===Bhikkhuni ordination===\nA few years after the arrival of Mahinda, [[Bhikkhuni]] [[Sanghamitta]], who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Ashoka came to Sri Lanka. She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century.\n\nMany women have been ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996.<ref>''Buddhist Studies Review'', vol. 24.2, p. 227</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1996 through the efforts of [[Sakyadhita International Association of Buddhist Women|Sakyadhita]], an International Buddhist Women Association, Theravada bhikkhuni order was revived, when 11 Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a procedure held by Ven.

Buddhism has been given the foremost place under Article 9 of the Constitution which can be traced back to an attempt to bring the status of Buddhism back to the status it enjoyed prior to being destroyed by colonialists. However, by virtue of Article 10 of the Sri Lankan constitution, religious rights of all communities are preserved.

Department of Census & Statistics, Sri Lanka.</ref> The island has been a center of Buddhist scholarship and learning since the introduction of Buddhism in the third century [[Common Era|BCE]] producing eminent scholars such as [[Buddhaghosa]] and preserving the vast [[P\u0101li Canon]]. Throughout most of its history, Sri Lankan kings have played a major role in the maintenance and revival of the Buddhist institutions of the island. During the 19th century, a modern Buddhist revival took place on the island which promoted Buddhist education and learning. There are around 6,000 Buddhist monasteries on Sri Lanka with approximately 15,000 monks.<ref name=Perera>Perera, HR, Buddhism in Sri Lanka A Short History, 2007, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/perera/wheel100.html</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Introduction of Buddhism===\n\nAccording to traditional Sri Lankan chronicles such as the ''[[Dipavamsa]]'', Buddhism was introduced into Sri Lanka in the third century BCE after the [[Third Buddhist council]] by [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Arhanth\u00e0 Mahinda thero]], son of Emperor [[Ashoka]], during the reign of [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura]]. After the arrival of Arahantha Mahinda, he invited his sister Sangamitta Thera to bring a sapling of the [[Bodhi Tree]] (where Buddha was enlightened) to Sri Lanka and the first Buddhist monastery, monuments and monk were introduced. Among these, the [[Isurumuniya]] and the [[Vessagiriya]] remain important centers of worship. He is also credited with the construction of the Pathamaka [[cetiya]], the Jambukola [[vihara|vih\u0101ra]] and the Hatth\u0101lhaka vih\u0101ra and the refectory. The Pali Canon, having previously been preserved as an oral tradition, was first converted into writing in Sri Lanka around 30 BCE. Along with Mahinda came his sibling Sanghamitra. She gave the nun ordinace to women devotees.\n\n''Mahavamsa'' \u00a729{{sfn|McEvilley|2012|p=558}} records that during the rule of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrian]] King [[Menander I]], a [[Yona]] head monk named [[Mahadharmaraksita]] led 30,000 Buddhist monks from \"the Greek city of Alasandra\" ([[v]], around {{convert|150|km}} north of modern [[Kabul]], Afghanistan) to Sri Lanka for the dedication of the [[Ruwanwelisaya]] in [[Anuradhapura]], indicating that [[Greco-Buddhism]] contributed to early Sri Lankan Buddhism. See also the ''[[Milinda Panha]]''.\n\n===Center of Pali literature===\nAs a result of the work of [[Buddhaghosa]] and other compilers such as [[Dhammapala]], Sri Lanka developed a strong tradition of written textual transmission of the Pali Canon. The compilation of the [[Atthakatha]] (commentaries) along with the [[Nik\u0101ya]]s and other Pitakas were committed to writing for the first time in the [[Aluvihare Rock Temple]] during the first century BCE.<ref name=Perera /> Buddhist literature in Sinhalese also thrived and by 410, Sri Lankan monks traveled widely throughout India and Asia introducing their works.\n\n===Therav\u0101da subdivisions===\n\nOver much of the early history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, three subdivisions of Therav\u0101da existed in Sri Lanka, consisting of the monks of the three [[mahavihara]]s: [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya]], [[Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra]] and [[Jetavanaramaya]].<ref name=\"Warder, A.K. 2000. p. 280\">Warder, A.K.

According to HR Perera, the Theravada commentaries considered them heretical and their doctrines included:\n{{quote|They held the view that the Buddha, having been born in the [[Tushita|Tusita heaven]], lived there and never came down to earth and it was only a created form that appeared among men. This created form and \u0100nanda, who learned from it, preached the doctrine. They also held that nothing whatever given to the Order bears fruit, for the Sangha, which in the ultimate sense of the term meant only the path and fruition, does not accept anything. According to them any human pair may enter upon sexual intercourse by mutual consent.<ref name=Perera />}}\n\n===Accounts of Chinese pilgrims===\n\nIn the 5th century, [[Faxian]] visited Sri Lanka and lived there for two years with the monks. Faxian obtained a [[Sanskrit]] copy of the [[Vinaya]] of the [[Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka]] at the [[Abhayagiri vih\u0101ra]] c. 406. The Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya was then translated into Chinese in 434 by Buddhajiva and [[Zhu Daosheng]].<ref>Hsing Yun. ''Humanistic Buddhism.'' 2005. p. 163</ref> This translation of the Mah\u012b\u015b\u0101saka Vinaya remains extant in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] as [[Taish\u014d Tripi\u1e6daka]] 1421.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.acmuller.net/descriptive_catalogue/files/k0895.html|title=The Korean Buddhist Canon: A Descriptive Catalog (T 1421)}}</ref>\n\nThe 7th-century pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] first learned for several years at [[Nalanda]] and then intended to go to Sri Lanka to seek out further instruction. However, after meeting Sri Lankan monks in the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]] capital who were refugees, he decided not to visit:\n{{quote|At the time of Hiuen Tsang's visit the capital was visited by 300 [[bhikkhu|Bhikshus]] of Ceylon who had left the island in consequence of [[famine]] and [[revolution]] there. On the pilgrim telling them of his intended visit to Ceylon for instruction, they told him that there were no Brethren there superior to them. Then the pilgrim discussed some [[Yogacara|Yoga]] texts with them and found that their explanations could not excel those given to him by [[\u015a\u012blabhadra]] at N\u0101land\u0101.{{sfn|Mookerji|1998|p=520}}}}\n\n===Decline and revival===\nFrom the 5th century to the eleventh century, the island of Sri Lanka saw continuous warfare between local kings, pretenders and foreign invaders such as the South Indian Chola and [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyan]] dynasties. This warfare saw the sacking of viharas and made the situation difficult for Buddhism.<ref name=Perera /> In 1070, [[Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa]] conquered the island and set about repairing the monasteries. The state of Sri Lankan Buddhism was so bad at this time that he could not find five bhikkhus in the whole island to ordain more monks and restore the monastic tradition; therefore, he sent an embassy to [[Burma]], which sent back several eminent elders with Buddhist texts.<ref name=Perera /> The king oversaw the ordination of thousands of monks. The royal reforming of Sri Lankan Buddhism continued under [[Parakramabahu I]] (c. 1153), who restored many stupas and monasteries. During this period, Sri Lankan Buddhist literature thrived once again and the three greats writers [[Mah\u0101kassapa Thera]] of [[Dimbulagala Raja Maha Vihara]], Moggallana Thera and [[S\u0101riputta Thera]] compiled Pali commentaries and [[Subcommentaries, Theravada|sub-commentaries]]. [[Parakramabahu II of Dambadeniya]] (from c. 1236) was a learned king and wrote several Sinhalese Buddhist texts.\n\n===Abolition of other Theravada traditions===\nBefore the 12th century, more rulers of Sri Lanka gave support and patronage to the Abhayagiris and travelers such as Faxian saw the Abhayagiris as the main Buddhist tradition in Sri Lanka.<ref>Hirakawa, Akira.

During periods of decline, the Sri Lankan monastic lineage was revived through contact with Burma and [[Thailand]].\n\n===Colonialism and Christianity===\n[[File:AMH-7013-KB Procession of monks on Ceylon.jpg|thumb|230px|Dutch painting of the Buddhist religious festival in Ceylon, c. 1672]]\nFrom the 16th century onwards, [[missionary|missionaries]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] colonizers of Sri Lanka have attempted to convert the local population to [[Christianity]]. The wars with the Portuguese and their allies weakened the Sangha. In 1592, [[Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy]] sought aid from Burma in order to ordain Buddhist monks on the island as there was hardly a single properly ordained monk left.<ref name=Perera /> From 1612 to 1658, the Dutch and the Portuguese fought over the island with the Sinhalese caught in the middle, the Dutch won and occupied the maritime sections of the island that had been occupied by the Portuguese until 1796 when they surrendered their territories to the British. The Dutch were less zealous than the Portuguese in their religious proselytizing though they still discriminated against Buddhists which were not allowed to register with the local authorities therefore many Sinhalese pretended to be Protestant.<ref name=Perera /> During this period many religiously inclined Sinhalese rulers of the interior such as [[Vira Narendra Sinha of Kandy]] (1706\u20131739) and [[Sri Vijaya Rajasinha of Kandy]] (1739\u20131747) continued to patronize Buddhism, restoring temples and monasteries.\n\nIn the mid 18th century the higher ordination of Buddhist monks known as [[upasampada]], which was defunct at the time, was revived with the help of Thai Buddhist monks on the initiatives taken by [[Weliwita Sri Saranankara Thero]] during the reign of king Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe.<ref>[http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items05/270405-2.html Weliwita Sri Saranankara Theroenerable Weliwita Sri Saranankara Mahathera], Dr. Daya Hewapathirane, Lankaweb</ref>\n\nIn 1813 the American Ceylon Mission (Protestant) was established in [[Jaffna]]. In 1815 a British army captured Kandy and deposed the Sinhalese king ending a line of Buddhist kings lasting 2301 years, they retained Sri Lanka until 1948. Like the Dutch, the British refused to register unbaptized infants and to accept non-Christian marriages. They also always preferred Christians in government administration. The British also supported various Christian missionary groups who established schools on the island. Education in these schools (which disparaged Buddhism) was a requirement for government office. Missionaries also wrote tracts in Sinhalese attacking Buddhism and promoting Christianity<ref name=Perera />\n\n===Buddhist revival===\n<!--\"Eight Precepts\" links here. If this section is renamed or removed, please adjust wikilink over there accordingly.-->\n[[File:Olcott and Buddhists.jpg|thumb|250px|Henry Olcott and Buddhists (Colombo, 1883).]]\nIn the 19th century, a national Buddhist movement began as a response to Christian proselytizing, and was empowered by the results of the [[Panadura]] debate between Christian priests and Buddhist monks such as [[Migettuwatte Gunananda Thera]] and [[Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala Thera]] which was widely seen as a victory for the Buddhists.<ref>[http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local/buddhists-must-safeguard-religion-sangha-thera Buddhists must safeguard religion, Sangha \u2013 Thera] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416202308/http://www.dailynews.lk/?q=local%2Fbuddhists-must-safeguard-religion-sangha-thera |date=2015-04-16 }}, Daily News</ref> In 1880 [[Henry Steel Olcott]] arrived in Sri Lanka with [[Madame Blavatsky]] of the [[Theosophical Society]]; he had been inspired when he read about the Panadura debate and after learning about Buddhism converted to the religion. Olcott and the Sinhalese Buddhist leaders established the Buddhist Theosophical Society in 1880, with the goal of establishing Buddhist schools (there were only three at the time, by 1940, there were 429 Buddhist schools on the island).<ref name=Perera /> The society also had its own publications to promote Buddhism; the Sinhalese newspaper, ''Sarasavisandarasa'', and its English counterpart, ''The Buddhist''. As a result of their efforts, [[Vesak]] became a public holiday, Buddhist registrars of marriage were allowed, and interest in Buddhism increased. Another important figure in the revival is [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], initially an interpreter for Olcott, who traveled around the island preaching and writing. After traveling to India, he established the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in 1891 whose goal was to revive Buddhism in India, and restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinara]].<ref name=\"maha\">[http://mahabodhisociety.com/ Maha Bodhi Society]</ref> His efforts saw the restoration of these sites and a renewal of interest in Buddhism among some Indians. The associations of the Buddhist revival also contributed much to the publication of Buddhist texts, and promotion of Buddhist scholarship. Revivalist Buddhist scholars include Sir [[D. B. Jayatilaka]], [[F. R. Senanayake]], [[Walisinghe Harischandra]] and [[W. A. de Silva]].<ref name=Perera /> Several Buddhist shrines were also rebuilt. Buddhist leaders were also active in the movement for Sri Lankan independence. Since independence, Buddhism has continued to thrive on the island. \n[[File:Zahntempel Kandy.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Temple of the Tooth]] was renovated during the Buddhist revival.]]\n\nThe Buddhist revival also resulted in Sinhala Buddhists carrying the torch of Buddhism and igniting it on foreign shores. Anagarika Dharmapala and [[Asoka Weeraratna]] are two such leading pioneers among many others. They pioneered the establishment of Buddhist Viharas in Europe. Anagarika Dharmapala founded the London Buddhist Vihara in 1926 while Asoka Weeraratna opened a new chapter for the spread of Buddhism in Germany and Europe by establishing the Berlin Buddhist Vihara in [[Paul Dahlke (Buddhist)|Dr. Paul Dahlke]]\u2019s Das Buddhistische Haus in 1957 with monks from Sri Lanka stationed on a long-term footing to spread the Dhamma. This was the first Theravada Buddhist Vihara in Germany and continental Europe.\n\nSince the Buddhist revival Sri Lanka has also been an important center of Western Buddhist scholarship. One of the first western bhikkhus, [[Nyanatiloka]] Mahathera studied in Sri Lanka, established the [[Island Hermitage]] there and ordained several western monks. Western monks who studied in the island hermitage such as [[Nanamoli Bhikkhu]] and Ven. [[Nyanaponika]] (who established the [[Buddhist Publication Society]] along with [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]]) were responsible for many important translations of the [[Pali Canon]] and other texts on Buddhism in English and German.\n\n===Bhikkhuni ordination===\nA few years after the arrival of Mahinda, [[Bhikkhuni]] [[Sanghamitta]], who is also believed to be the daughter of Emperor Ashoka came to Sri Lanka. She started the first nun's order in Sri Lanka, but this order of nuns died out in Sri Lanka in the 11th century.\n\nMany women have been ordained in Sri Lanka since 1996.<ref>''Buddhist Studies Review'', vol. 24.2, p. 227</ref>{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 1996 through the efforts of [[Sakyadhita International Association of Buddhist Women|Sakyadhita]], an International Buddhist Women Association, Theravada bhikkhuni order was revived, when 11 Sri Lankan women received full ordination in Sarnath, India, in a procedure held by Ven.

It was designed by Bill Wadge and Ed Ashcroft and described in the 1985 book ''Lucid, the Dataflow Programming Language''.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\npLucid was the first [[interpreter]] for Lucid.\n\n==Model==\n'''Lucid''' uses a demand-driven model for data computation. Each statement can be understood as an equation defining a network of processors and communication lines between them through which data flows. Each [[variable (computer science)|variable]] is an infinite stream of values and every function is a filter or a transformer. [[Iteration]] is simulated by 'current' values and 'fby' (read as 'followed by') operator allowing composition of streams.\n\nLucid is based on an [[algebra]] of histories, a history being an infinite sequence of data items. Operationally, a history can be thought of as a record of the changing values of a variable, history operations such as first and next can be understood in ways suggested by their names. Lucid was originally conceived as a  disciplined, mathematically pure, single-assignment language, in which verification would be simplified. However, the [[dataflow]] interpretation has been an important influence on the direction in which Lucid has evolved.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103454/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage2.prx?exp=960]\n\n==Details==\nIn Lucid (and other [[dataflow]] languages) an expression that contains a variable that has not yet been [[Free variables and bound variables|bound]] waits until the variable has been bound, before proceeding. An expression like <code>x + y</code> will wait until both x and y are bound before returning with the output of the expression. An important consequence of this is that explicit logic for updating related values is avoided, which results in substantial code reduction, compared to mainstream languages.\n\nEach variable in Lucid is a stream of values.

It was designed by Bill Wadge and Ed Ashcroft and described in the 1985 book ''Lucid, the Dataflow Programming Language''.<ref name=\"book\"/>\n\npLucid was the first [[interpreter]] for Lucid.\n\n==Model==\n'''Lucid''' uses a demand-driven model for data computation. Each statement can be understood as an equation defining a network of processors and communication lines between them through which data flows. Each [[variable (computer science)|variable]] is an infinite stream of values and every function is a filter or a transformer. [[Iteration]] is simulated by 'current' values and 'fby' (read as 'followed by') operator allowing composition of streams.\n\nLucid is based on an [[algebra]] of histories, a history being an infinite sequence of data items. Operationally, a history can be thought of as a record of the changing values of a variable, history operations such as first and next can be understood in ways suggested by their names. Lucid was originally conceived as a kind of very disciplined, mathematically pure, single-assignment language, in which verification would be very much simplified. However, the [[dataflow]] interpretation has been a very important influence on the direction in which Lucid has evolved.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110514103454/http://hopl.murdoch.edu.au/showlanguage2.prx?exp=960]\n\n==Details==\nIn Lucid (and other [[dataflow]] languages) an expression that contains a variable that has not yet been [[Free variables and bound variables|bound]] waits until the variable has been bound, before proceeding. An expression like <code>x + y</code> will wait until both x and y are bound before returning with the output of the expression. An important consequence of this is that explicit logic for updating related values is avoided, which results in substantial code reduction, compared to mainstream languages.\n\nEach variable in Lucid is a stream of values. An expression <code>n = 1 fby n + 1</code> defines a stream\nusing the operator 'fby' (a [[mnemonic]] for \"followed by\"). fby defines what comes after the previous\nexpression. (In this instance the stream produces 1,2,3,...).\nThe values in a stream can be addressed by these operators (assuming x is the variable being used):\n\n<code>'first x'</code> - fetches the first value in the stream x,\n\n<code>'x'</code> - the current value of the stream,\n\n<code>'next x'</code> - fetches the next value in the stream.\n\n<code>'asa'</code> - an operator that does some thing 'as soon as' the condition given becomes true.\n\n<code>'x upon p'</code> - upon is an operator that repeats the old value of the stream x, and updates to the new values only when the stream p makes a <code>true</code> value available. (It serves to slow down the stream x) \ni.e.: <code>x upon p</code> is the stream x with new values appearing upon the truth of p.\n\nThe computation is carried out by defining filters or transformation functions that act on these time-varying streams of data.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===[[Factorial]]===\n\n fac\n   where\n     n = 0 fby (n + 1);\n     fac = 1 fby ( fac * (n + 1) );\n   end\n \n===[[Fibonacci sequence]]===\n\n fib\n   where\n     fib = 0 fby ( 1 fby fib + next fib );\n   end\n\n===Total of a Sequence===\n\n total\n   where\n      total = 0 fby total + x\n   end;\n\n===Running Average===\n\n running_avg\n   where \n      sum = first(input) fby sum + next(input);\n      n = 1 fby n + 1;\n      running_avg = sum / n;\n   end;\n\n===[[Prime number]]s===\n\n prime\n   where\n      prime = 2 fby (n whenever [[isprime]](n));\n      n = 3 fby n+2;\n      isprime(n) = not(divs) asa divs or prime*prime > N\n                      where\n                        N is current n;\n                        divs = N mod prime eq 0;\n                      end;\n   end\n\n====[[Dataflow diagram]]====\n[[File:Prime numbers sequence dataflow diagram (Lucid).png|center|579x579px]]\n\n===[[Quick sort]]===\n\n qsort(a) = if eof(first a) then {{not a typo|a}} else follow(qsort(b0),qsort(b1)) fi\n   where\n      p = first a < a;\n      b0 = a whenever p;\n      b1 = a whenever not p;\n      follow(x,y) = if xdone then y upon xdone else x fi\n                      where\n                         xdone = iseod x fby xdone or iseod x; \n                      end\n   end\n\n====Data flow diagram====\n     --------> whenever -----> qsort ---------\n    |             ^                           |\n    |             |                           |\n    |            not                          |\n    |             ^                           |\n    |---> first   |                           |\n    |       |     |                           |\n    |       V     |                           |\n    |---> less ---                            |\n    |             |                           |\n    |             V                           V\n ---+--------> whenever -----> qsort -----> conc -------> ifthenelse ----->\n    |                                                       ^   ^\n    |                                                       |   |\n     --------> next ----> first ------> iseod --------------    |\n    |                                                           |\n     -----------------------------------------------------------\n\n===[[Root mean square]]===\n\n sqroot(avg(square(a)))\n   where\n      square(x) = x*x;\n      avg(y)    = mean\n         where\n           n = 1 fby n+1;\n           mean = first y fby mean + d;\n           d = (next y - mean)/(n+1);\n         end;\n      sqroot(z) = approx asa  err < 0.0001\n         where\n           Z is current z;\n           approx = Z/2 fby (approx + Z/approx)/2;\n           err    = abs(square(approx)-Z);\n         end;\n    end\n\n===[[Hamming problem]]===\n\n h\n    where\n      h = 1 fby merge(merge(2 * h, 3 * h), 5 * h);\n      merge(x,y) = if xx <= yy then xx else yy fi\n         where \n           xx = x upon xx <= yy;\n           yy = y upon yy <= xx;\n         end;\n    end;\n\n====Dataflow Diagram====\n[[File:Hamming problem dataflow diagram (Lucid).png|center|Hamming problem dataflow diagram]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"book\">{{Cite book\n| first1 = William W.\n| last1 = Wadge\n| first2 = Edward A.\n| last2 = Ashcroft\n| date = 1985\n| title = Lucid, the Dataflow Programming Language\n| publisher = Academic Press\n| isbn = 0-12-729650-6\n| url = https://archive.org/details/luciddataflowpro00wadg_0\n| accessdate = 8 January 2015\n| url-access = registration\n}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://code.google.com/p/plucid/ pLucid] \n\n\n[[Category:Academic programming languages]]\n[[Category:Concurrent programming languages]]\n[[Category:Declarative programming languages]]\n[[Category:Experimental programming languages]]\n[[Category:Reactive programming languages]]\n[[Category:Query languages]]\n", "name_user": "Nomoteretes", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed some unnecessary uses of \"very\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_(programming_language)"}

{"title_page": "Device driver", "text_new": "{{About|device drivers for hardware|other aasoftware \ndrivers|sex\n (software)}}\nIn [[computing]], a '''device driver''' is a [[computer program]] that operates or controls a particular type of device that is attached to a computer.<ref name=\"dev1\">{{cite web|title=What is a device driver?|url=http://searchenterprisedesktop.techtarget.com/definition/device-driver|website=WhatIs.com|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> A driver provides a [[software interface]] to hardware devices, enabling operating systems and other computer programs to access hardware functions without needing to know precise details about the hardware being used.\n\nA driver communicates with the [[Peripheral|device]] through the [[computer bus]] or communications subsystem to which the hardware connects. When a calling program invokes a [[subroutine|routine]] in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device. Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program. Drivers are hardware dependent and [[operating system|operating-system]]-specific. They usually provide the [[interrupt]] handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCCfRAj3aCgC&dq=device+driver+hardware+dependent&hl=fil&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Information Storage and Management: Storing, Managing, and Protecting Digital Information|year=2010|author=EMC Education Services|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nThe main purpose of device drivers is to provide abstraction by acting as a translator between a hardware device and the applications or [[operating system]]s that use it.<ref name=\"dev1\"/>  Programmers can write higher-level application code independently of whatever specific hardware the end-user is using.\nFor example, a high-level application for interacting with a [[serial port]] may simply have two functions for \"send data\" and \"receive data\". At a lower level, a device driver implementing these functions would communicate to the particular serial port controller installed on a user's computer. The commands needed to control a [[16550 UART]] are much different from the commands needed to control an [[FTDI]] serial port converter, but each hardware-specific device driver [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstracts]] these details into the same (or similar) software interface.\n\n==Development==\nWriting a device driver requires an in-depth understanding of how the hardware and the software works for a given [[Computing platform|platform]] function. Because drivers require low-level access to hardware functions in order to operate, drivers typically operate in a highly [[privilege (computing)|privilege]]d environment and can cause system operational issues if something goes wrong. In contrast, most user-level software on modern [[operating system]]s can be stopped without greatly affecting the rest of the system. Even drivers executing in [[user mode]] can crash a system if the device is [[Erroneous program|erroneously programmed]]. These factors make it more difficult and dangerous to diagnose problems.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aFQAAAAMAAJ&q=writing+a+device+driver&dq=writing+a+device+driver&hl=fil&sa=X&ei=yA2jUJyXEKmfiAes44CIAQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ|title=Writing device drivers: tutorial and reference|year=1995|author=Burke, Timothy|publisher=Digital Press}}</ref>\n\nThe task of writing drivers thus usually falls to [[software engineer]]s or [[computer engineer]]s who work for hardware-development companies. This is because they have better information than most outsiders about the design of their hardware. Moreover, it was traditionally considered in the hardware [[manufacturer]]'s interest to guarantee that their clients can use their hardware in an optimum way. Typically, the [[Logical Device Driver]] (LDD) is written by the operating system vendor, while the [[Physical Device Driver]] (PDD) is implemented by the device vendor. But in recent years, non-vendors have written numerous [[proprietary device driver]]s, mainly for use with [[free and open source software|free and open source]] [[operating system]]s. In such cases, it is important that the hardware manufacturer provides information on how the device communicates. Although this information can instead be learned by [[reverse engineering]], this is much more difficult with hardware than it is with software.\n\n[[Microsoft]] has attempted to reduce system instability due to poorly written device drivers by creating a new framework for driver development, called [[Windows Driver Foundation]] (WDF).  This includes [[User-Mode Driver Framework]] (UMDF) that encourages development of certain types of drivers\u2014primarily those that implement a [[message-based protocol]] for communicating with their devices\u2014as user-mode drivers. If such drivers malfunction, they do not cause system instability. The [[Kernel-Mode Driver Framework]] (KMDF) model continues to allow development of kernel-mode device drivers, but attempts to provide standard implementations of functions that are known to cause problems, including cancellation of I/O operations, power management, and plug and play device support.\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has an open-source framework for developing drivers on [[macOS]], called [[I/O Kit]].\n\nIn [[Linux kernel|Linux]] environments, programmers can build device drivers as parts of the [[Linux kernel|kernel]], separately as loadable [[loadable kernel module|module]]s, or as user-mode drivers (for certain types of devices where kernel interfaces exist, such as for USB devices). [[Makedev]] includes a list of the devices in Linux: ttyS (terminal), lp ([[parallel port]]), hd (disk), loop, sound  (these include [[Sound card mixer|mixer]], [[Music sequencer|sequencer]], [[Digital signal processor|dsp]], and audio)...<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl8_MAKEDEV.htm\n | title = MAKEDEV&nbsp;\u2014 Linux Command&nbsp;\u2014 Unix Command\n | publisher = Linux.about.com\n | date = 2009-09-11\n | accessdate = 2009-09-17\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Microsoft Windows]] [[.sys]] files and [[Linux]] .ko modules contain loadable device drivers. The advantage of loadable device drivers is that they can be loaded only when necessary and then unloaded, thus saving kernel memory.\n\n==Kernel mode vs. user mode==\nDevice drivers, particularly on {{as of | 2009 | alt = modern}} [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms, can run in [[CPU modes|kernel-mode]] ([[Ring (computer security)|Ring 0 on x86 CPUs]]) or in [[user space|user-mode]] (Ring&nbsp;3 on x86 CPUs).<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/eb1936c0-e19c-4a17-a1a8-39292e4929a41033.mspx?mfr=true\n | title = User-mode vs. Kernel-mode Drivers\n | publisher = [[Microsoft]]\n | date = 2003-03-01\n | accessdate = 2008-03-04\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080309012600/http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/eb1936c0-e19c-4a17-a1a8-39292e4929a41033.mspx?mfr=true\n | archive-date = 2008-03-09\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref> The primary benefit of running a driver in user mode is improved stability, since a poorly written user-mode device driver cannot crash the system by overwriting kernel memory.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://blogs.msdn.com/iliast/archive/2006/10/10/Introduction-to-the-User_2D00_Mode-Driver-Framework.aspx\n | title = Introduction to the User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF)\n | date = 2006-10-10\n | accessdate = 2008-03-04\n | publisher = [[Microsoft]]\n}}</ref> On the other hand, user/kernel-mode transitions usually impose a considerable performance overhead, thus making kernel-mode drivers preferred for low-latency networking.\n\nKernel space can be accessed by user module only through the use of system calls. End user programs like the UNIX  shell or other GUI-based applications are part of the user space. These applications interact with hardware through kernel supported functions.\n\n==Applications==\nBecause of the diversity of {{as of | 2009 | alt = modern}} hardware and operating systems, drivers operate in many different environments.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfU7RtI7OX8C&dq=applications+device+driver&hl=fil&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Understanding Computers 2009: Today and Tomorrow|year=2009|author=Deborah Morley|publisher=Cengage Learning}}</ref> Drivers may [[interface (computer science)|interface]] with:\n\n* [[Computer printer|Printers]]\n* [[Video card|Video adapters]]\n* [[Network interface controller|Network cards]]\n* [[Sound card]]s\n* Local [[Computer bus|buses]] of various sorts\u2014in particular, for [[bus mastering]] on modern systems\n* Low-[[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] [[input/output|I/O]] buses of various sorts (for [[pointing device]]s such as [[Computer mouse|mice]], [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]s, [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], etc.)\n* [[Computer storage]] devices such as [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]], [[CD-ROM]], and [[floppy disk]] buses ([[Advanced Technology Attachment|ATA]], [[Serial ATA|SATA]], [[SCSI]])\n* Implementing support for different [[file system]]s\n* [[Image scanner]]s\n* [[Digital camera]]s\n\nCommon levels of abstraction for device drivers include:\n* For hardware:\n** Interfacing directly\n** Writing to or reading from a [[device control register]]\n** Using some higher-level interface (e.g. [[Video BIOS]])\n** Using another lower-level device driver (e.g. file system drivers using disk drivers)\n** Simulating work with hardware, while doing something entirely different<ref name=\"Computer Peripherals and Interfaces\">{{cite book|title=Computer Peripherals and Interfaces|date=January 2008|publisher=Technical Publications Pune|isbn=8184314744|pages=5\u20138 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uK01xKT_mAMC&pg=SA5-PA8&lpg=SA5-PA8&dq=Simulating+work+with+hardware,+while+doing+something+entirely+different&source=bl&ots=tFgCB2iFaQ&sig=G4YPK6LI2KrIT7MN6IoDKt4THOk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjhpOnBxMDMAhXHvBQKHYYMAwEQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&q=Simulating%20work%20with%20hardware%2C%20while%20doing%20something%20entirely%20different&f=false|accessdate=2016-05-03|ref=CPIbook}}</ref>\n* For software:\n** Allowing the operating system direct access to hardware resources\n** Implementing only [[primitive (computer science)|primitive]]s\n** Implementing an interface for non-driver software (e.g. [[TWAIN]])\n** Implementing a language, sometimes quite high-level (e.g. [[PostScript]])\n\nSo choosing and installing the correct device drivers for given hardware is often a key component of computer system configuration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.drivers.com/update/drivers-news/what-are-device-drivers-and-why-do-we-need-them/|title=What are Device Drivers and why do we need them?|date=April 17, 2015|access-date=March 19, 2018|website=drivers.com}}</ref>\n\n==Virtual device drivers==\nVirtual device drivers represent a particular variant of device drivers. They are used to emulate a hardware device, particularly in [[virtual machine|virtualization]] environments, for example when a [[DOS]] program is run on a [[Microsoft Windows]] computer or when a guest [[operating system]] is run on, for example, a [[Xen]] host. Instead of enabling the guest operating system to dialog with hardware, virtual device drivers take the opposite role and emulates a piece of hardware, so that the guest operating system and its drivers running inside a [[virtual machine]] can have the illusion of accessing real hardware. Attempts by the guest operating system to access the hardware are routed to the virtual device driver in the host operating system as e.g.,&nbsp;[[function call]]s. The virtual device driver can also send simulated processor-level events like [[interrupt]]s into the virtual machine.\n\nVirtual devices may also operate in a non-virtualized environment. For example, a virtual [[Network interface controller|network adapter]] is used with a [[virtual private network]], while a virtual [[Hard disk drive|disk]] device is used with [[iSCSI]]. A good example for virtual device drivers can be [[Daemon Tools]].\n\nThere are several variants of virtual device drivers, such as [[VxD]]s, [[VLM (NetWare)|VLM]]s, and VDDs.\n\n==Open source drivers==\n* [[Free and open-source graphics device driver|Graphics device driver]]\n* Printers: [[CUPS]]\n* RAIDs: CCISS<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url         = http://sourceforge.net/projects/cciss/\n| title       = CCISS\n| year        = 2010\n| work        = [[SourceForge]]\n| accessdate  = 2010-08-11\n| quote       = Drivers for the HP (previously Compaq) Smart Array controllers which provide hardware RAID capability.\n}}\n</ref> (Compaq Command Interface for SCSI-3 Support<ref>{{cite web\n |url             = http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg246852.pd\n |title           = Abbreviations and acronyms\n |first           = Steve\n |last            = Russell\n |date            = 2003-10-21\n |work            = Server Consolidation with the IBM eserver xSeries 440 and VMware ESX Serve\n |publisher       = IBM International Technical Support Organization\n |page            = 207\n |isbn            = 0-7384-2684-9\n |accessdate      = 2011-08-14\n |display-authors = etal\n}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>)\n* Scanners: [[Scanner Access Now Easy|SANE]]\n* Video: [[Vidix]], [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]]\n\n[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] descriptions of commonly used device drivers:\n* fas: Fast/wide SCSI controller\n* hme: Fast (10/100 Mbit/s) Ethernet\n* isp: Differential SCSI controllers and the SunSwift card\n* glm: (Gigabaud Link Module<ref>{{cite web\n | title = US Patent 5969841 - Gigabaud link module with received power detect signal\n | url = http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5969841.html\n | publisher = PatentStorm LLC\n | accessdate = 2009-09-08\n | quote = An improved Gigabaud Link Module (GLM) is provided for performing bi-directional data transfers between a host device and a serial transfer medium.\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110612215844/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5969841.html\n | archive-date = 2011-06-12\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>) UltraSCSI controllers\n* scsi: Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) devices\n* sf: soc+ or social Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (FCAL)\n* soc: SPARC Storage Array (SSA) controllers and the control device\n* social: Serial optical controllers for FCAL (soc+)\n\n==APIs==\n* [[Windows Display Driver Model]] (WDDM) \u2013 the graphic display driver architecture for [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]], and [[Windows 10]].\n* Unified Audio Model (UAM)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms894071.aspx|title=Unified Audio Model (Windows CE 5.0)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n* [[Windows Driver Foundation]] (WDF)\n* [[Windows Driver Model]] (WDM)\n* [[Network Driver Interface Specification]] (NDIS) \u2013 a standard [[network card]] driver API\n* [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture]] (ALSA) \u2013 {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} the standard Linux sound-driver interface\n* [[Scanner Access Now Easy]] (SANE) \u2013 a public-domain interface to raster-image scanner-hardware\n* [[I/O Kit]] \u2013 an open-source framework from [[Apple Computer|Apple]] for developing [[macOS]] device drivers\n* [[Installable File System]] (IFS) \u2013 a [[filesystem API]] for IBM OS/2 and Microsoft Windows NT\n* [[Open Data-Link Interface]] (ODI) \u2013 a network card API similar to NDIS\n* [[Uniform Driver Interface]] (UDI) \u2013 a cross-platform driver interface project\n* Dynax Driver Framework (dxd) \u2013 C++ open source cross-platform driver framework for KMDF and IOKit<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dxd.dynax.at/|title=dxd - dynax driver framework: Main Page|website=dxd.dynax.at|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Identifiers==\nA device on the [[Conventional PCI|PCI bus]] or USB is identified by two IDs which consist of 4 [[hexadecimal]] numbers each.

When a calling program invokes a [[subroutine|routine]] in the driver, the driver issues commands to the device. Once the device sends data back to the driver, the driver may invoke routines in the original calling program. Drivers are hardware dependent and [[operating system|operating-system]]-specific. They usually provide the [[interrupt]] handling required for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interface.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sCCfRAj3aCgC&dq=device+driver+hardware+dependent&hl=fil&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Information Storage and Management: Storing, Managing, and Protecting Digital Information|year=2010|author=EMC Education Services|publisher=John Wiley & Sons}}</ref>\n\n==Purpose==\nThe main purpose of device drivers is to provide abstraction by acting as a translator between a hardware device and the applications or [[operating system]]s that use it.<ref name=\"dev1\"/>  Programmers can write higher-level application code independently of whatever specific hardware the end-user is using.\nFor example, a high-level application for interacting with a [[serial port]] may simply have two functions for \"send data\" and \"receive data\". At a lower level, a device driver implementing these functions would communicate to the particular serial port controller installed on a user's computer. The commands needed to control a [[16550 UART]] are much different from the commands needed to control an [[FTDI]] serial port converter, but each hardware-specific device driver [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstracts]] these details into the same (or similar) software interface.\n\n==Development==\nWriting a device driver requires an in-depth understanding of how the hardware and the software works for a given [[Computing platform|platform]] function. Because drivers require low-level access to hardware functions in order to operate, drivers typically operate in a highly [[privilege (computing)|privilege]]d environment and can cause system operational issues if something goes wrong. In contrast, most user-level software on modern [[operating system]]s can be stopped without greatly affecting the rest of the system. Even drivers executing in [[user mode]] can crash a system if the device is [[Erroneous program|erroneously programmed]]. These factors make it more difficult and dangerous to diagnose problems.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aFQAAAAMAAJ&q=writing+a+device+driver&dq=writing+a+device+driver&hl=fil&sa=X&ei=yA2jUJyXEKmfiAes44CIAQ&ved=0CC8Q6AEwAQ|title=Writing device drivers: tutorial and reference|year=1995|author=Burke, Timothy|publisher=Digital Press}}</ref>\n\nThe task of writing drivers thus usually falls to [[software engineer]]s or [[computer engineer]]s who work for hardware-development companies. This is because they have better information than most outsiders about the design of their hardware. Moreover, it was traditionally considered in the hardware [[manufacturer]]'s interest to guarantee that their clients can use their hardware in an optimum way. Typically, the [[Logical Device Driver]] (LDD) is written by the operating system vendor, while the [[Physical Device Driver]] (PDD) is implemented by the device vendor. But in recent years, non-vendors have written numerous [[proprietary device driver]]s, mainly for use with [[free and open source software|free and open source]] [[operating system]]s. In such cases, it is important that the hardware manufacturer provides information on how the device communicates. Although this information can instead be learned by [[reverse engineering]], this is much more difficult with hardware than it is with software.\n\n[[Microsoft]] has attempted to reduce system instability due to poorly written device drivers by creating a new framework for driver development, called [[Windows Driver Foundation]] (WDF).  This includes [[User-Mode Driver Framework]] (UMDF) that encourages development of certain types of drivers\u2014primarily those that implement a [[message-based protocol]] for communicating with their devices\u2014as user-mode drivers. If such drivers malfunction, they do not cause system instability. The [[Kernel-Mode Driver Framework]] (KMDF) model continues to allow development of kernel-mode device drivers, but attempts to provide standard implementations of functions that are known to cause problems, including cancellation of I/O operations, power management, and plug and play device support.\n\n[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has an open-source framework for developing drivers on [[macOS]], called [[I/O Kit]].\n\nIn [[Linux kernel|Linux]] environments, programmers can build device drivers as parts of the [[Linux kernel|kernel]], separately as loadable [[loadable kernel module|module]]s, or as user-mode drivers (for certain types of devices where kernel interfaces exist, such as for USB devices). [[Makedev]] includes a list of the devices in Linux: ttyS (terminal), lp ([[parallel port]]), hd (disk), loop, sound  (these include [[Sound card mixer|mixer]], [[Music sequencer|sequencer]], [[Digital signal processor|dsp]], and audio)...<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://linux.about.com/od/commands/l/blcmdl8_MAKEDEV.htm\n | title = MAKEDEV&nbsp;\u2014 Linux Command&nbsp;\u2014 Unix Command\n | publisher = Linux.about.com\n | date = 2009-09-11\n | accessdate = 2009-09-17\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Microsoft Windows]] [[.sys]] files and [[Linux]] .ko modules contain loadable device drivers.

They are used to emulate a hardware device, particularly in [[virtual machine|virtualization]] environments, for example when a [[DOS]] program is run on a [[Microsoft Windows]] computer or when a guest [[operating system]] is run on, for example, a [[Xen]] host. Instead of enabling the guest operating system to dialog with hardware, virtual device drivers take the opposite role and emulates a piece of hardware, so that the guest operating system and its drivers running inside a [[virtual machine]] can have the illusion of accessing real hardware. Attempts by the guest operating system to access the hardware are routed to the virtual device driver in the host operating system as e.g.,&nbsp;[[function call]]s. The virtual device driver can also send simulated processor-level events like [[interrupt]]s into the virtual machine.\n\nVirtual devices may also operate in a non-virtualized environment. For example, a virtual [[Network interface controller|network adapter]] is used with a [[virtual private network]], while a virtual [[Hard disk drive|disk]] device is used with [[iSCSI]]. A good example for virtual device drivers can be [[Daemon Tools]].\n\nThere are several variants of virtual device drivers, such as [[VxD]]s, [[VLM (NetWare)|VLM]]s, and VDDs.\n\n==Open source drivers==\n* [[Free and open-source graphics device driver|Graphics device driver]]\n* Printers: [[CUPS]]\n* RAIDs: CCISS<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url         = http://sourceforge.net/projects/cciss/\n| title       = CCISS\n| year        = 2010\n| work        = [[SourceForge]]\n| accessdate  = 2010-08-11\n| quote       = Drivers for the HP (previously Compaq) Smart Array controllers which provide hardware RAID capability.\n}}\n</ref> (Compaq Command Interface for SCSI-3 Support<ref>{{cite web\n |url             = http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/pdfs/sg246852.pd\n |title           = Abbreviations and acronyms\n |first           = Steve\n |last            = Russell\n |date            = 2003-10-21\n |work            = Server Consolidation with the IBM eserver xSeries 440 and VMware ESX Serve\n |publisher       = IBM International Technical Support Organization\n |page            = 207\n |isbn            = 0-7384-2684-9\n |accessdate      = 2011-08-14\n |display-authors = etal\n}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>)\n* Scanners: [[Scanner Access Now Easy|SANE]]\n* Video: [[Vidix]], [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure]]\n\n[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] descriptions of commonly used device drivers:\n* fas: Fast/wide SCSI controller\n* hme: Fast (10/100 Mbit/s) Ethernet\n* isp: Differential SCSI controllers and the SunSwift card\n* glm: (Gigabaud Link Module<ref>{{cite web\n | title = US Patent 5969841 - Gigabaud link module with received power detect signal\n | url = http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5969841.html\n | publisher = PatentStorm LLC\n | accessdate = 2009-09-08\n | quote = An improved Gigabaud Link Module (GLM) is provided for performing bi-directional data transfers between a host device and a serial transfer medium.\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110612215844/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/5969841.html\n | archive-date = 2011-06-12\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>) UltraSCSI controllers\n* scsi: Small Computer Serial Interface (SCSI) devices\n* sf: soc+ or social Fiber Channel Arbitrated Loop (FCAL)\n* soc: SPARC Storage Array (SSA) controllers and the control device\n* social: Serial optical controllers for FCAL (soc+)\n\n==APIs==\n* [[Windows Display Driver Model]] (WDDM) \u2013 the graphic display driver architecture for [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows 7]], [[Windows 8]], and [[Windows 10]].\n* Unified Audio Model (UAM)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms894071.aspx|title=Unified Audio Model (Windows CE 5.0)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n* [[Windows Driver Foundation]] (WDF)\n* [[Windows Driver Model]] (WDM)\n* [[Network Driver Interface Specification]] (NDIS) \u2013 a standard [[network card]] driver API\n* [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture]] (ALSA) \u2013 {{as of | 2009 | lc = on}} the standard Linux sound-driver interface\n* [[Scanner Access Now Easy]] (SANE) \u2013 a public-domain interface to raster-image scanner-hardware\n* [[I/O Kit]] \u2013 an open-source framework from [[Apple Computer|Apple]] for developing [[macOS]] device drivers\n* [[Installable File System]] (IFS) \u2013 a [[filesystem API]] for IBM OS/2 and Microsoft Windows NT\n* [[Open Data-Link Interface]] (ODI) \u2013 a network card API similar to NDIS\n* [[Uniform Driver Interface]] (UDI) \u2013 a cross-platform driver interface project\n* Dynax Driver Framework (dxd) \u2013 C++ open source cross-platform driver framework for KMDF and IOKit<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dxd.dynax.at/|title=dxd - dynax driver framework: Main Page|website=dxd.dynax.at|access-date=2016-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Identifiers==\nA device on the [[Conventional PCI|PCI bus]] or USB is identified by two IDs which consist of 4 [[hexadecimal]] numbers each.

The selection of multimedia brands offered by this division varies depending on the country or region.\n\n==MTV in Europe==\nOn 1 August 1987, [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] formed a joint venture with [[BT Group|BT]] and [[Robert Maxwell]], and created [[MTV (European TV channel)|the first MTV channel in Europe]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/31/business/viacom-gets-mtv-europe.html|title=Viacom Gets MTV Europe|first=The Associated|last=Press|date=31 August 1991|via=The New York Times}}</ref> The channel was based in [[Amsterdam]] upon launch before relocating to [[London]]. From 1997, MTV Networks Europe established its regionalisation strategy launching localised channels across many European countries/regions.\n\nThis is a list of regional MTV channels still operating in Europe, West Asia, Africa, in order of launch:\n\n*[[MTV Germany]] (March 1997)\n*[[MTV (UK and Ireland)|MTV UK]] (July 1997)\n*[[MTV Italy]] (September 1997)\n*[[MTV Russia]] (September 1998, relaunched October 2013)\n*[[MTV France]] (June 2000)\n*[[MTV Poland]] (July 2000)\n*[[MTV (Dutch TV channel)|MTV Netherlands]] (September 2000)\n*[[MTV Spain]] (September 2000)\n*[[MTV Romania]] (June 2002; closed February 2019)\n*[[MTV Portugal]] (July 2003)\n*[[MTV Flanders]] (February 2004)\n*[[MTV Ireland]] (February 2004)\n*[[MTV Denmark]] (May 2005)\n*[[MTV Finland]], [[MTV Sweden]], [[MTV Norway]] (September 2005)\n*[[MTV Hungary]] (October 2007)\n*[[MTV Israel]] (October 2007)\n*[[MTV Live HD]] (September 2008)\n*[[MTV Switzerland]] (April 2009)\n*[[MTV Africa|MTV South Africa]] (2015)\n\n==MTV branding==\nUpon its launch in Europe in the late 1980s, MTV Europe made use of MTV US's on-air identity. Overtime, MTV Europe gradually produced its own on-air identity throughout the 1990s. From 1997, MTV's regionalization throughout Europe brought about specialized on-air identity which reflected the tastes and influences from each region. As part of a global rebranding strategy, [[MTV Networks International]] decided to produce a new on-air identity that would air on all MTV channels around the world (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). On 1 July 2009 all 64 MTV channels globally began to share the same on-air branding. This branding made use of a standardised logo, idents and promos<ref name=\"universaleverything\">{{cite web |url=http://www.universaleverything.com/289 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705074052/http://www.universaleverything.com/289 |archive-date=5 July 2009 |url-status=dead |title=Universal Everything |accessdate=18 April 2014  }}</ref> (except MTV US, MTV Canada and MTV Brazil). The on-air branding initiative was called '''Pop X1000''' reflecting the changing nature of popular culture with MTV at the heart of these rapid changes. The branding was designed by MTV's design department '''World Design Studio''' in [[Milan]] (home to both [[Fininvest]] and [[Mediaset]]), with additional designs added by other global departments throughout the year. The branding was overseen by [[Universal Everything]]. This branding was adopted by MTV Networks Europe, [[MTV Networks Asia]], [[MTV Networks Africa]] and [[MTV Networks Latin America]]. As part of MTV's rebrand awareness campaign MTV teamed up with Spanish retailer [[Zara (clothing)|ZARA]] in December 2009 to provide branded themed T-shirts and hoodies representing the \"Pop X 1000%\" campaign.<ref name=\"presse\">{{cite web |url=http://presse.mtv.de/scripts/presseinformationen.php3?ACTION=anzeigen&OFFSET=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207054229/http://www.presse.mtv.de/scripts/presseinformationen.php3?ACTION=anzeigen&OFFSET=1 |archive-date=7 February 2007 |url-status=dead |title=Presseservice MTV |author=Alexander Selck/Michael Trammer/Damian Hopa www.sethora.de |accessdate=18 April 2014  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.zara.com/mtv/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206121800/http://www.zara.com/mtv/ |date=6 December 2009 }}</ref> On 8 November 2010 MTV launched its third phase of idents.<ref name=\"creativereview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/november/mtv-55dsl-collaboration-yields-new-idents-and-t-shirts |title=Creative Review \u2013 MTV & 55DSL collaboration yields new idents and T-shirts |publisher=creativereview.co.uk |accessdate=18 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207232546/http://creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2010/november/mtv-55dsl-collaboration-yields-new-idents-and-t-shirts |archivedate=7 December 2010  }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, MTV US rebranded its entire network of channels producing a revised version of the traditional MTV logo. It was decided that MTV Networks International channels would adopt this logo at a later date. On 1 July 2011 MTV Networks Europe will rebrand its network across Europe and globally. MTV's will replace its traditional logo the MTV:Music Television logo to be replaced by the current MTV US logo.<ref name=\"totaaltv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.totaaltv.nl/?action=nieuws&id=5392|title=Totaal TV &#124; MTVN HD wordt MTV Live HD|publisher=totaaltv.nl|accessdate=18 April 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007151120/http://www.totaaltv.nl/?action=nieuws&id=5392|archivedate=7 October 2011}}</ref> On 30 June 2011 MTV's localized websites throughout Europe began to use the new branding. As part of a new strategy MTV Networks Europe will be part of Viacom Media International Networks. It is expected that MTV Networks Europe will be rebranded in the winter of 2011.\n\nIn the fall of 2013, Viacom International Media Networks announced it would relaunch its MTV channels globally with a new on-air identity. This came into effect on 1 October 2013.\n\nOn 25 June 2015, MTV International channels were rebranded with a new initiative to get more viewers involved with the channel. MTV launched MTVBump.com where viewers could upload short video clips which will air on MTV channels worldwide (excluding MTV US and MTV Canada). MTV also launched MTV Art Breaks where creative viewers can create special MTV idents. MTV would also launch MTV Creative, another initiative to coincide with MTV Bump.  However, MTV's rebrand still saw falling ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2015/06/25/mtv-rebrand-social-media-video/|title=MTV rebrands as the channel of social media video|date=25 June 2015|website=factmag.com|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704100008/http://www.factmag.com/2015/06/25/mtv-rebrand-social-media-video/|archivedate=4 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2018, MTV Global began to roll out 'MTV Mood' identity on-air and online. The new look was first used by local MTV channels across Latin America. MTV Europe began using the new look at the end of 2017 along with MTV Germany, before rolling out across Europe in January/February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/22-28-january-2018/mtv-looks-humanise-new-branding/|title=MTV looks to \"humanise\" with new branding|date=22 January 2018|website=designweek.co.uk|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123202026/https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/22-28-january-2018/mtv-looks-humanise-new-branding/|archivedate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Websites==\nSince January 2010, MTV Networks Europe has started to rebrand its localized websites featuring a standard website for each region. The website design is similar for each region but has information, news and entertainment specific to each region. MTV Belgium, MTV Netherlands, MTV Switzerland, MTV Portugal, MTV Sweden and MTV Denmark were the first to receive the new look website layout and design.\n\nA new design and layout were released in late 2017 before rolling out across MTV globally in 2018. A new global design was launched in October 2019.\n\n==Broadcasting Agreements==\n\nViacomCBS International Media Networks has utilized the broadcasting laws and regulation from both the United Kingdom and Poland to licence and secure broadcasting agreements across Europe, whilst maintaining EU regulation. In the past, the majority of MTV's channels were regulated by authorities based in the UK ([[Ofcom]]) and Poland ([[The National Broadcasting Council]]).

The on-air branding initiative was called '''Pop X1000''' reflecting the changing nature of popular culture with MTV at the heart of these rapid changes. The branding was designed by MTV's design department '''World Design Studio''' in [[Milan]] (home to both [[Fininvest]] and [[Mediaset]]), with additional designs added by other global departments throughout the year.

This came into effect on 1 October 2013.\n\nOn 25 June 2015, MTV International channels were rebranded with a new initiative to get more viewers involved with the channel. MTV launched MTVBump.com where viewers could upload short video clips which will air on MTV channels worldwide (excluding MTV US and MTV Canada). MTV also launched MTV Art Breaks where creative viewers can create special MTV idents. MTV would also launch MTV Creative, another initiative to coincide with MTV Bump.
