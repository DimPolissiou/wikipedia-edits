Born and raised in South Africa, Kieswetter moved to England to complete his education, and began playing [[county cricket]] for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in 2007. Three years later, he made his international debut in a [[One Day International]] (ODI) against [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]]. A [[wicket-keeper]] [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]], he was considered a one-day specialist, and all his international appearances came in ODIs or [[Twenty20 International]]s.\n\nKieswetter played junior cricket for [[Western Province cricket team (South Africa)|Western Province]] until the age of 18, but lack of opportunity led him to seek an alternative route in England. He studied at [[Millfield]], where he was noticed by Somerset. The county's lack of a strong wicket-keeper gave Kieswetter his opportunity, and he made his debut for the team early in the 2007 season. Through his Scottish mother, he qualified to play county cricket, and his performances soon generated discussion about his potential to play for England. Around this time, the captain of [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]], [[Graeme Smith]], invited him to return to play in South Africa but Kieswetter preferred to qualify for England.\n\nIn early 2010, Kieswetter achieved his target; some strong performances for the [[England Lions cricket team|England Lions]], especially in a match against the senior England team, won him a place in the squad to face Bangladesh. His selection, along with the presence of other South African-born players in the England team, was criticised; some commentators suggested there should be fewer foreign-born players in the team. Kieswetter scored his only international [[Century (cricket)|century]] in his third match, and a couple of months later he was the [[man of the match]] in the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20 Final|final]] when England won the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]]. After a promising start for England, he was dropped owing to his inconsistency before the end of 2010. He returned to the team the following year, but his place was insecure, and in 2013 he was replaced by [[Jos Buttler]], his teammate at Somerset.\n\nKieswetter's career was cut short by an injury sustained while batting for Somerset in July 2014: a ball penetrated the gap between his [[cricket helmet|helmet]]'s grille and visor and struck him in the face, damaging his vision. There was some hope of a full recovery and he was named in a provisional England squad for the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], but he continued to experience difficulties with his vision and he announced his retirement from professional cricket in June 2015, aged 27.

2010 and 2013. Born and raised in South Africa, Kieswetter moved to England to complete his education, and began playing [[county cricket]] for [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] in 2007. Three years later, he made his international debut in a [[One Day International]] (ODI) against [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]]. A [[wicket-keeper]] [[Batting (cricket)|batsman]], he was considered a one-day specialist, and all his international appearances came in ODIs or [[Twenty20 International]]s.\n\nKieswetter played junior cricket for [[Western Province cricket team (South Africa)|Western Province]] until the age of 18, but lack of opportunity led him to seek an alternative route in England. He studied at [[Millfield]], where he was noticed by Somerset. The county's lack of a strong wicket-keeper gave Kieswetter his opportunity, and he made his debut for the team early in the 2007 season. Through his Scottish mother, he qualified to play county cricket, and his performances soon generated discussion about his potential to play for England. Around this time, the captain of [[South Africa cricket team|South Africa]], [[Graeme Smith]], invited him to return to play in South Africa but Kieswetter preferred to qualify for England.\n\nIn early 2010, Kieswetter achieved his target; some strong performances for the [[England Lions cricket team|England Lions]], especially in a match against the senior England team, won him a place in the squad to face Bangladesh. His selection, along with the presence of other South African-born players in the England team, was criticised; some commentators suggested there should be fewer foreign-born players in the team. Kieswetter scored his only international [[Century (cricket)|century]] in his third match, and a couple of months later he was the [[man of the match]] in the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20 Final|final]] when England won the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]]. After a promising start for England, he was dropped owing to his inconsistency before the end of 2010. He returned to the team the following year, but his place was insecure, and in 2013 he was replaced by [[Jos Buttler]], his teammate at Somerset.\n\nKieswetter's career was cut short owing to an injury sustained while batting for Somerset in July 2014: a ball penetrated the gap between his [[cricket helmet|helmet]]'s grille and visor and struck him in the face, damaging his vision. There was initially some hope of a full recovery and he was named in a provisional England squad for the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], but he continued to experience difficulties with his vision. As a result of these problems, in June 2015, aged 27, he announced his retirement from professional cricket. In 2017, he became a professional golfer.\n\n==Early life and career==\nKieswetter was born in [[Johannesburg]] to an [[Afrikaner]] father, Wayne, and [[Scotland|Scottish]] mother, Belinda.<ref name=\"couldbeKP\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/425603.html |title=The keeper who could be KP |website=ESPNcricinfo |publisher=ESPN |last=James |first=Jeremy |date=20 September 2009 |accessdate=17 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108040618/http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/425603.html |archivedate=8 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportingpost.co.za/2012/12/gr2-selangor-cup/ |title=Christmas Comes Early |work=Sporting Post |location=Cape Town |date=25 August 2013 |accessdate=4 November 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082940/http://www.sportingpost.co.za/2012/12/gr2-selangor-cup/ |archivedate=22 December 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He studied at [[Diocesan College]] in [[Cape Town]], and played cricket for [[Western Province cricket team (South Africa)|Western Province]] junior teams between the ages of 13 and 18.

The story has been adapted for the cinema on several occasions.  The seventeenth book in Zola's ''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]'' series, it is based upon the railway between [[Paris]] and [[Le Havre]] in the 19th century and is a tense, [[psychological thriller]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe main characters are Roubaud, the deputy station master at Le Havre, his wife S\u00e9verine, and Jacques Lantier. Lantier is an engine driver on the line and the family link with the rest of ''Les Rougon-Macquart'' series. He is the son of Gervaise (''[[L'Assommoir]]''), the brother of \u00c9tienne Lantier (''[[Germinal (novel)|Germinal]]'') and Claude Lantier (''[[L'\u0152uvre]]''), and the half-brother of the eponymous [[Nana (novel)|Nana]].\n\n==Plot==\nLantier, the \"human beast\" of the title, has a hereditary madness and has several times in his life wanted to murder women. At the beginning of the story he is an engine driver, in control of his engine, \"La Lison.\" His relationship with \"La Lison\" is almost sexual and provides some degree of control over his mania.\n\nAs a result of a chance remark, Roubaud suspects that S\u00e9verine has had an affair some years earlier, with Grandmorin, one of the directors of the railway company, who had acted as her patron and who had helped Roubaud get his job. He forces a confession out of her and makes her write a letter to Grandmorin, telling him to take a particular train that evening, the same train Roubaud and S\u00e9verine are taking back to Le Havre.\n\nMeanwhile, Lantier, who is not working while his engine is being repaired, goes to visit his Aunt Phasie who lives in an isolated house by the railway. On leaving he meets his cousin, Flore, with whom he has had a longstanding mutual attraction. After a brief conversation with her his passions become inflamed and he is on the verge of raping her but this in turn brings on his homicidal mania. He has a desire to stab her but just about controls himself and rushes away. Finding himself beside the railway track as the train from Paris passes, he sees, in a split second, a figure on the train holding a knife, bent over another person. Shortly after, he finds the body of Grandmorin beside the track with his throat cut. It is also discovered that he has been robbed of his watch and some money.\n\nAn investigation is launched and Roubaud and S\u00e9verine are prime suspects, as they were on the train at the time and were due to inherit some property from Grandmorin. The authorities never suspect their true motive. Lantier sees Roubaud while waiting to be interviewed and identifies him as the murderer on the train, but when questioned, says he cannot be sure. The investigating magistrate, believing that the killer was Cabuche, a carter who lived nearby, dismisses Roubaud and S\u00e9verine. The murder remains unsolved.\n\nDespite being cleared of suspicion, the marriage of Roubaud and S\u00e9verine declines. Zola casually tosses in a remark that the money and watch stolen from Grandmorin was hidden behind the skirting board in their apartment, thus confirming the reader's suspicion that Roubaud was the murderer all along. S\u00e9verine and Lantier begin an affair, at first clandestinely but then more blatantly until they are caught ''in flagrante delicto'' by Roubaud. Despite his previous jealousy, Roubaud seems unmoved and spends less and less time at home and turns to gambling and drink.\n\nS\u00e9verine admits to Lantier that Roubaud committed the murder and that together they disposed of the body. Lantier feels the return of his desire to kill and one morning leaves the apartment to kill the first woman he meets. After having picked a victim, he is seen by someone he knows, and so abandons the idea. He then realizes that he has the desire no longer. It is his relationship with S\u00e9verine and her association with the murder that has abated his desire.\n\nThe relationship between Roubaud and his wife deteriorates when she realizes that he has taken the last of the hidden money. Lantier has the opportunity to invest money in a friend's business venture in New York. S\u00e9verine suggests they use the money from the sale of the property they inherited from Grandmorin. Roubaud is now the only obstacle to this new life and they decide to kill him. They approach him one night when he is working as a watchman at the station, hoping that the murder will be attributed to robbers. At the last moment however, Lantier loses his nerve.\n\nCousin Flore, meanwhile, sees Lantier pass her house every day on the train and noticing S\u00e9verine with him, realizes they are having an affair and becomes insanely jealous, wishing to kill them both. She hatches a plot to remove a rail from the line in order to cause a derailment of his train. One morning, she seizes an opportunity, when Cabuche leaves his wagon and horses unattended, near the railway line. She leads the horses onto the line, shortly before the train arrives. In the resulting crash, numerous people are killed and Lantier is seriously injured. S\u00e9verine, however, remains unhurt. Wracked by guilt, Flore commits suicide by walking in front of a train.\n\nS\u00e9verine nurses Lantier back to health. She convinces him that they must kill Roubaud and Lantier finally gives in, and they concoct a plan to get away with it completely. However, Lantier's mania returns, and when S\u00e9verine tries to make love with him, just before Roubaud is due to arrive, he murders her. The unfortunate Cabuche is the first to find her body and is accused of killing her at the behest of Roubaud. Both are put on trial for this and the murder of Grandmorin. They are both convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nLantier begins driving again, but his new engine is just a number to him. He begins an affair with his fireman's girlfriend.\n\nThe novel ends as Lantier is driving a train carrying troops towards the front at the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The resentment between Lantier and his fireman breaks out as the train is travelling at full steam. Both fall to their deaths as the train full of happy, drunken, patriotic and doomed soldiers hurtles driverless through the night.\n\n==Publication history==\n\n* 1890, ''La B\u00eate humaine'' (French), Paris: [[Biblioth\u00e8que-Charpentier]]\n* 1968, ''The Beast in Man'' (translated by [[Robert Godfrey Goodyear]] and [[P.J.R.
