This brought them in conflict with the [[British Raj|British]], who controlled directly or indirectly the north Indian plains between Delhi and Calcutta. A series of campaigns termed the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] occurred in 1814\u20131816. In 1815 the British general [[David Ochterlony|Ochterlony]] evicted the Nepalese from Garhwal and Kumaon across the Kali River,{{sfnp|Whelpton, A History of Nepal|2005|p=41-42}}<ref>\n{{harvp|Rose, Nepal \u2013 Strategy for Survival|1971|pp=83\u201385}}: \"Ochterlony forced Amar Singh Thapa to agree at Malaun to terms under which the Nepali army retired with their arms, and the territory between the Kali and Sutlej rivers came under the control of the British.\"\n</ref> ending their 12-year occupation, which is remembered for its brutality and repression.{{sfnp|Whelpton, A History of Nepal|2005|p=58}}<ref>{{citation |first=E.

The Nepalese refusal to accede to the terms led to another campaign the following year, targeting the [[Kathmandu Valley]], after which the Nepalese capitulated.<ref>\n{{harvp|Whelpton, A History of Nepal|2005|p=41-42}}: \"The Nepalese government initially balked at these terms, but agreed to ratify them in March 1816 after Ochterloney occupied the Makwanpur Valley only thirty miles from the capital.\"\n</ref><ref>\n{{harvp|Rose, Nepal \u2013 Strategy for Survival|1971|pp=87\u201388}}: \"[In 1816] With the collapse of the main defense line, the Darbar quickly dispatched Chandra Sekhar Upadhyaya to Ochterlony's camp with a copy of the Sugauli treaty bearing the seal of the Maharaja.\"\n</ref>\n\nThe signatory for Nepal was Guru [[Gajraj Mishra]] aided by [[Chandra Sekher Upadhayaya]], the signatory for the Company was Lieutenant Colonel [[Paris Bradshaw]]. The treaty called for territorial concessions in which some of the territories controlled by Nepal would be given to British India, the establishment of a British representative in [[Kathmandu]], and allowed Britain to recruit [[Gurkha]]s for military service. Nepal also lost the right to employ any American or European employee in its service (earlier several French commanders had been deployed to train the Nepali army).\n\nUnder the treaty, some of the Nepalese controlled territory was lost including all the territories that the King of Nepal had won in wars in the last 25 years or so such as the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] [[Darjeeling]] in the east, [[Kumaon Kingdom]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom]] (also known as Gadhwal) in the west. Some of the [[Terai]] lands were restored to Nepal in 1816 and more were restored in 1860 to thank for helping the British to suppress the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]].\n\nThe British representative in Kathmandu was the first Westerner allowed to live in the post-Malla Era Nepal. (It is to be noted that few [[Christian mission|Christian missionaries]] operating were deported by the Gorkhas after conquering Nepal during the mid 18th century). The first representative was Edward Gardner, who was installed at a compound north of Kathmandu. That site is now called Lazimpat and is home to the Indian and British [[embassy|embassies]]. \n\nThe Sugauli Treaty was superseded in December 1923 by a \"treaty of perpetual peace and friendship,\" which upgraded the British [[Resident (title)|resident]] to an envoy. A separate treaty was signed with [[India]] (independent by now) in 1950 which established relations between the two countries.\n\n== Terms ==\nHistorian [[John Whelpton]] writes:\n{{quote|Negotiations for a general settlement produced a draft which was initialled at Sagauli in Bihar in December 1815 and required Nepal to give up all territories west and east of its present-day borders, to surrender the entire Tarai and to accept a permanent British representative (or 'resident') in Kathmandu. The Nepalese government initially balked at these terms, but agreed to ratify them in March 1816 after Ochterloney occupied the Makwanpur Valley only thirty miles from the capital.{{sfnp|Whelpton, A

This brought them in conflict with the [[British Raj|British]], who controlled directly or indirectly the north Indian plains between Delhi and Calcutta. A series of campaigns termed the [[Anglo-Nepalese War]] occurred in 1814\u20131816. In 1815 the British general [[David Ochterlony|Ochterlony]] evicted the Nepalese from Garhwal and Kumaon across the Kali River,{{sfnp|Whelpton, A History of Nepal|2005|p=41-42}}<ref>\n{{harvp|Rose, Nepal \u2013 Strategy for Survival|1971|pp=83\u201385}}: \"Ochterlony forced Amar Singh Thapa to agree at Malaun to terms under which the Nepali army retired with their arms, and the territory between the Kali and Sutlej rivers came under the control of the British.\"\n</ref> ending their 12-year occupation, which is remembered for its brutality and repression.{{sfnp|Whelpton, A History of Nepal|2005|p=58}}<ref>{{citation |first=E.

The Nepalese refusal to accede to the terms led to another campaign the following year, targeting the [[Kathmandu Valley]], after which the Nepalese capitulated.<ref>\n{{harvp|Whelpton, A History of Nepal|2005|p=41-42}}: \"The Nepalese government initially balked at these terms, but agreed to ratify them in March 1816 after Ochterloney occupied the Makwanpur Valley only thirty miles from the capital.\"\n</ref><ref>\n{{harvp|Rose, Nepal \u2013 Strategy for Survival|1971|pp=87\u201388}}: \"[In 1816] With the collapse of the main defense line, the Darbar quickly dispatched Chandra Sekhar Upadhyaya to Ochterlony's camp with a copy of the Sugauli treaty bearing the seal of the Maharaja.\"\n</ref>\n\nThe signatory for Nepal was Guru [[Gajraj Mishra]] aided by [[Chandra Sekher Upadhayaya]], the signatory for the Company was Lieutenant Colonel [[Paris Bradshaw]]. The treaty called for territorial concessions in which some of the territories controlled by Nepal would be given to British India, the establishment of a British representative in [[Kathmandu]], and allowed Britain to recruit [[Gurkha]]s for military service. Nepal also lost the right to employ any American or European employee in its service (earlier several French commanders had been deployed to train the Nepali army).\n\nUnder the treaty, some of the Nepalese controlled territory was lost including all the territories that the King of Nepal had won in wars in the last 25 years or so such as the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] [[Darjeeling]] in the east, [[Kumaon Kingdom]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom]] (also known as Gadhwal) in the west. Some of the [[Terai]] lands were restored to Nepal in 1816 and more were restored in 1860 to thank for helping the British to suppress the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]].\n\nThe British representative in Kathmandu was the first Westerner allowed to live in the post-Malla Era Nepal. (It is to be noted that few [[Christian mission|Christian missionaries]] operating were deported by the Gorkhas after conquering Nepal during the mid 18th century). The first representative was Edward Gardner, who was installed at a compound north of Kathmandu. That site is now called Lazimpat and is home to the Indian and British [[embassy|embassies]]. \n\nThe Sugauli Treaty was superseded in December 1923 by a \"treaty of perpetual peace and friendship,\" which upgraded the British [[Resident (title)|resident]] to an envoy. A separate treaty was signed with [[India]] (independent by now) in 1950 which established relations between the two countries.\n\n== Terms ==\nHistorian [[John Whelpton]] writes:\n{{quote|Negotiations for a general settlement produced a draft which was initialled at Sagauli in Bihar in December 1815 and required Nepal to give up all territories west and east of its present-day borders, to surrender the entire Tarai and to accept a permanent British representative (or 'resident') in Kathmandu. The Nepalese government initially balked at these terms, but agreed to ratify them in March 1816 after Ochterloney occupied the Makwanpur Valley only thirty miles from the capital.{{sfnp|Whelpton, A

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC).

While out shopping, they run into Gordon \"Gordo\" Moseley, Simon's former high school classmate. Gordo begins dropping in unannounced and delivering gifts including [[koi]] for their pond. He makes Simon uncomfortable, but Robyn sees no problem.\n\nGordo invites the couple to his large and elegant home. He receives a phone call and leaves abruptly, making Simon more suspicious. When he returns, Simon tells him to stay away from his family. The next day, Robyn finds the koi dead and their dog missing. Simon drives to Gordo's house to confront him, but discovers it is not actually his home. In the days following, Robyn suspects she is not alone in the house while Simon is at work. Unable to sleep, she steals prescription pills from her neighbor and one morning faints.\n\nThe dog returns and Robyn receives a letter of apology from Gordo. She is puzzled by his writing that he was \"willing to let bygones be bygones\". Simon says he does not know what it refers to and refuses to make peace with Gordo, telling Robyn that her pills are making her paranoid.\n\nRobyn becomes pregnant. At her baby shower, Simon's sister tells her that, at school, Simon and his friend Greg reported that Gordo had been [[child molestation|molested]]. Gordo was bullied afterwards and had to transfer. Robyn finds Greg, who reveals that the molestation story was fabricated by Simon, who was a bully with a \"real mean streak.\" As a result of the story, Gordo's father thought he was gay and nearly killed him (leading to his father's arrest for [[attempted murder]]), before shipping him off to military school. When asked why Simon would do such a thing, Greg replies \"because he could.\" Robyn searches Simon's home office and discovers that he has run background checks on Gordo, who has spent his life in and out of prison, and someone named Danny McDonald.\n\nRobyn learns Simon has beaten Danny for a promotion after troubling information was revealed from Danny's previous job. Robyn confronts Simon about Gordo, but he denies responsibility. Simon angrily blames Robyn's suggestions of reconciliation on her own past traumas of being bullied at school. At Robyn's behest, Simon tracks down Gordo and half-heartedly apologizes, but Gordo does not accept his apology. Furious, Simon attacks him.\n\nSimon's promotion party is interrupted by Danny, who says Simon fabricated the information that ruined his career. Robyn goes into labor and gives birth to a boy. The next morning, Simon receives a call from his boss telling him that his fraud has been discovered and he will not be keeping his job. Robyn tells him that she wants to separate.\n\nSimon goes home and finds another gift box, containing footage of Gordo ready to sexually assault Robyn after she fainted moments earlier. Meanwhile, Gordo visits Robyn in the hospital to congratulate her, wearing his arm in a sling; he tells her Simon injured him. Simon rushes to the hospital but misses Gordo. Gordo calls him soon after, taunting him, refusing to confirm or deny that he raped Robyn, leaving Simon to wonder whether the baby is his. With his marriage and career destroyed, Simon breaks down.

The film stars [[Jason Bateman]] and [[Rebecca Hall]] as a couple intimidated by a figure from Simon's past played by Edgerton.\n\nIt was released in the United States on August 7, 2015, as the first film released by [[STX Entertainment]]. The film grossed $58.9 million worldwide on a budget of $5 million and received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised Edgerton's direction and screenplay, as well as Bateman's performance.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, summaries should be generic and MUST NOT OVERREACH 400-700 WORDS! As of July 2016, the plot has over 497 words; IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO ADD OR EXTEND ANY DETAILS! -->\nA married couple, Simon and Robyn Callem, relocate from [[Chicago]] to a [[Los Angeles]] suburb after Simon takes a new job. While out shopping, they run into Gordon \"Gordo\" Moseley, Simon's former high school classmate. Gordo begins dropping in unannounced and delivering gifts including [[koi]] for their pond. He makes Simon uncomfortable, but Robyn sees no problem.\n\nGordo invites the couple to his large and elegant home. He receives a phone call and leaves abruptly, making Simon more suspicious. When he returns, Simon tells him to stay away from his family. The next day, Robyn finds the koi dead and their dog missing. Simon drives to Gordo's house to confront him, but discovers it is not actually his home. In the days following, Robyn suspects she is not alone in the house while Simon is at work. Unable to sleep, she steals prescription pills from her neighbor and one morning faints.\n\nThe dog returns and Robyn receives a letter of apology from Gordo. She is puzzled by his writing that he was \"willing to let bygones be bygones\". Simon says he does not know what it refers to and refuses to make peace with Gordo, telling Robyn that her pills are making her paranoid.\n\nRobyn becomes pregnant. At her baby shower, Simon's sister tells her that, at school, Simon and his friend Greg reported that Gordo had been [[child molestation|molested]]. Gordo was bullied afterwards and had to transfer. Robyn finds Greg, who reveals that the molestation story was fabricated by Simon, who was a bully with a \"real mean streak.\" As a result of the story, Gordo's father thought he was gay and nearly killed him (leading to his father's arrest for [[attempted murder]]), before shipping him off to military school. When asked why Simon would do such a thing, Greg replies \"because he could.\" Robyn searches Simon's home office and discovers that he has run background checks on Gordo, who has spent his life in and out of prison, and someone named Danny McDonald.\n\nRobyn learns Simon has beaten Danny for a promotion after troubling information was revealed from Danny's previous job. Robyn confronts Simon about Gordo, but he denies responsibility. Simon angrily blames Robyn's suggestions of reconciliation on her own past traumas of being bullied at school. At Robyn's behest, Simon tracks down Gordo and half-heartedly apologizes, but Gordo does not accept his apology. Furious, Simon attacks him.\n\nSimon's promotion party is interrupted by Danny, who says Simon fabricated the information that ruined his career. Robyn goes into labor and gives birth to a boy. The next morning, Simon receives a call from his boss telling him that his fraud has been discovered and he will not be keeping his job. Robyn tells him that she wants to separate.\n\nSimon goes home and finds another gift box, containing footage of Gordo ready to sexually assault Robyn after she fainted moments earlier. Meanwhile, Gordo visits Robyn in the hospital to congratulate her, wearing his arm in a sling; he tells her Simon injured him. Simon rushes to the hospital but misses Gordo. Gordo calls him soon after, taunting him, refusing to confirm or deny that he raped Robyn, leaving Simon to wonder whether the baby is his. With his marriage and career destroyed, Simon breaks down. Gordo watches through a window and walks away, removing his arm sling.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jason Bateman]] as Simon Callem<ref name=BatemanCast>{{cite news|last1=Fleming Jr|first1=Mike|title=Jon Bateman To Star In Joel Edgerton\u2019s Helming Debut|url=https://deadline.com/2015/01/jason-bateman-joel-edgerton-directorial-debut-1201349548/|accessdate=April 2, 2015|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=January 13, 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Rebecca Hall]] as Robyn Callem<ref name=HallCast>{{cite news|last1=Sneider|first1=Jeff|last2=Ge|first2=Linda|title=Rebecca Hall to Star in Joel Edgerton's Directorial Debut (Exclusive)|url=https://thewrap.com/rebecca-hall-to-star-in-joel-edgertons-directorial-debut-exclusive/|accessdate=April 2, 2015|work=thewrap|date=November 3, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Joel Edgerton]] as Gordon \"Gordo\" Mosley<ref name=EdgertonCast>{{cite news|last1=George|first1=Sandy|title=Joel Edgerton to shoot debut feature in California|url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/toronto/edgerton-to-shoot-debut-in-california/5060203.article|accessdate=April 2, 2015|publisher=screendaily.com|date=September 9, 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Tim Griffin (actor)|Tim Griffin]] as Kevin \"KK\" Keelor\n* [[Allison Tolman]] as Lucy<ref name=\"release\">{{cite news |last=Lloyd |first=Kenji |url= http://www.finalreel.co.uk/the-gift-uk-release-date-august/#more-9914 |title=The Gift UK Release Date Set for August; Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall & Joel Edgerton Star |work=Final Reel |date=May 21, 2015 }}</ref>\n* [[Beau Knapp]] as Detective Walker\n* [[P.J.
