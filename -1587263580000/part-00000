Housing approximately 185 students, it is one of the smaller colleges in the region. It was founded as Studholme House in 1915 to provide facilities for domestic science students. The college maintains close links with the Department of Human Nutrition (the successor to the university's School of Home Science), though it now accepts students from all faculties.\n\n==History==\n\n===A House for Home Science===\nStudholme College was established in 1915 as Studholme House, to provide accommodation for students attending the School of Home Science, which had been opened in 1911. It was named Studholme in honour of Colonel John Studholme who, after seeing the merits of home economics departments in US universities, had worked for the establishment of a School of Home Science in New Zealand.

Over the first few years, Professor Boys-Smith allowed some training to occur in her own home and housed a few of the domestic science students.\n\nA more sustainable solution for student accommodation was achieved through the building of Studholme House in 1915 at the corner of Leith and Union Streets. While the school already had its own teaching facilities (\"The Old Tin Shed\", vacated by the School of Mines), they provided limited space and some degree of teaching was undertaken at the new House.\n\nExpansions occurred, in the form of two more Union Street houses, but by 1926 additional accommodation at nearby [[Arana College|Arana]] had to be arranged to fill the deficit of space. Further houses were built over the next ten years and, by 1937, plans for a larger hall of residence had gained sufficient momentum for a substantial fund-raising campaign to begin. Due to the outbreak of war, difficulties finding qualified staff (exacerbated by a wage disparity between hostel and university teaching staff) and general financial hardship, plans were postponed and a variety of interim measures enacted, sending students to board and the use of university-lent accommodation.\n\nDuring this period, the fortieth anniversary of the school occurred and, as part of the celebrations, a coat of arms approved by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] in Scotland was presented to Studholme House.\n\n===The development of a Hall===\nIn 1955, encouragement came through the Minister of Finance, who promised to match money spent, pound-for-pound, on a new hall of residence and to provide a government grant of \u00a318,400 for the building of a dining room block to train dietitians \u2013 the latter being completed in 1959. The large-scale campaign for funding took off again and, eventually, a contract price of \u00a3123,989, given by W.H. Naylor, Ltd was accepted. Funds were provided by the government, the work of local appeal committees around the country, private companies, associations and private gifts, as substantial as \u00a310,000 (from Miss Annie E. Stevenson, one of the first graduates of the School). By 1961, a new ferro-concrete, six-story block was built, housing 109 students in single rooms, and four wardens. A number of improvements and additions were carried out on the original house, which subsequently provided a student common room, staff room and library, as well as the existing kitchen block.\n\nDuring the school's Golden Jubilee in 1961, the new Studholme Hall was officially opened by the then Governor-General, [[Charles Lyttelton, 10th Viscount Cobham|Sir Charles Lyttelton]] who commented, on the occasion, that \"there is no substitute, in terms of social progress, for living together in a community.\"\n\n===Recent history===\nIn 1994, sixteen further bedrooms were added, bringing the total number of beds to 136.\n\nA further 42 students live in six adjacent houses, which were acquired and fully integrated into the College in 1998.

After a frenzied attempt at [[CPR]], Jesse contacts [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] for help. Feigning ignorance of Jane's death, Walt calls [[Saul Goodman]]. Saul sends [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], a cleaner, to remove all evidence of drugs from Jesse's apartment and to coach him on how to interact with authorities. Jane's father [[Donald Margolis|Donald]] arrives at the apartment to find that his daughter has died, with Jesse being interviewed by the medical examiner. Jesse is unable to look Donald in the eyes, and, believing himself to be responsible for Jane's death, runs off to a [[crack house]]. Walt locates Jesse and takes him to rehab.\n\nMeanwhile, Walt is preparing to undergo surgery to remove his cancer. The website that [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Walter White, Jr.|Walt Jr.]] made to bring in anonymous donations{{mdash}}in reality being used by Saul to [[money laundering|launder]] Walt's drug money{{mdash}}has gained media attention due to its apparent success; Walt is uncomfortable in the spotlight. On the day of Walt's operation, as he is put under [[anesthetic]]s, he accidentally reveals the existence of a second cell phone he uses, making [[Skyler White]] suspicious of his activities again. \n\nSix weeks later, after Walt is released from the hospital, Skyler reveals to him that she has investigated his behavior of the past several months and found out he has lied to her many times. Walt offers to tell her everything if she stays, but she is too afraid to know and decides to leave him. By this time, Donald has returned to work as an [[air traffic controller]]. While on the job, his mind wanders back to Jane's death; in his emotional state, he inadvertently allows the flight paths of two commercial airliners to cross over [[Albuquerque]]. \n\nWalt is sitting beside his swimming pool when he is startled by an explosion overhead.  He looks up to see a fireball in the sky above his house, the result of an apparent midair collison. Moments later, a charred pink teddy bear lands in the pool.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by [[Vince Gilligan]], and directed by [[Adam Bernstein]]. It aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on May 31, 2009. The plane crash at the end of the episode was inspired by the [[1986 Cerritos mid-air collision]]. Coincidentally, Walter White, ''Breaking Bad'''s protagonist, shares a name with an air traffic controller involved in the Cerritos collision.\n\nThis episode introduced the character of Mike as played by [[Jonathan Banks]]. The role of the cleaner to help Jesse prepare to deal with the police was originally meant to be handled by [[Saul Goodman]], played by [[Bob Odenkirk]], but due to commitments to ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', he was not available for filming of this episode, so [[Vince Gilligan]] created Mike for that episode and into the next season as a \"cleaner\".<ref name=\"hiatt20150316\">{{Cite magazine |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |last2=Hiatt |first2=Brian |date=2015-03-16 |title=Bob Odenkirk on ''Saul'' and ''Mr. Show''{{'s}} Non-Reunion |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/bob-odenkirk-on-better-call-saul-and-the-mr-show-non-reunion-96299/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe episode received critical acclaim.

Walt locates Jesse and takes him to rehab.\n\nMeanwhile, Walt is preparing to undergo surgery to remove his cancer. The website that [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Walter White, Jr.|Walt Jr.]] made to bring in anonymous donations{{mdash}}in reality being used by Saul to [[money laundering|launder]] Walt's drug money{{mdash}}has gained media attention due to its apparent success; Walt is uncomfortable in the spotlight. On the day of Walt's operation, as he is put under [[anesthetic]]s, he accidentally reveals the existence of a second cell phone he uses, making [[Skyler White]] suspicious of his activities again. \n\nSix weeks later, after Walt is released from the hospital, Skyler reveals to him that she has investigated his behavior of the past several months and found out he has lied to her many times. Walt offers to tell her everything if she stays, but she is too afraid to know and decides to leave him. By this time, Donald has returned to work as an [[air traffic controller]]. While on the job, his mind wanders back to Jane's death; in his emotional state, he inadvertently allows the flight paths of two commercial airliners to cross over [[Albuquerque]]. \n\nWalt is sitting beside his swimming pool when he is startled by an explosion overhead.  He looks up to see a fireball in the sky above his house, the result of an apparent midair collison. Moments later, a charred pink teddy bear lands in the pool.\n\n==Production==\nThe episode was written by [[Vince Gilligan]], and directed by [[Adam Bernstein]]. It aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on May 31, 2009. The plane crash at the end of the episode was inspired by the [[1986 Cerritos mid-air collision]]. Coincidentally, Walter White, ''Breaking Bad'''s protagonist, shares a name with an air traffic controller involved in the Cerritos collision.\n\nThis episode introduced the character of Mike as played by [[Jonathan Banks]]. The role of the cleaner to help Jesse prepare to deal with the police was originally meant to be handled by [[Saul Goodman]], played by [[Bob Odenkirk]], but due to commitments to ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', was not available for filming of this episode, so [[Vince Gilligan]] created Mike for that episode and into the next season as a \"cleaner\".<ref name=\"hiatt20150316\">{{Cite magazine |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |last2=Hiatt |first2=Brian |date=2015-03-16 |title=Bob Odenkirk on ''Saul'' and ''Mr. Show''{{'s}} Non-Reunion |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/bob-odenkirk-on-better-call-saul-and-the-mr-show-non-reunion-96299/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe episode received critical acclaim.

Alaol's works included ''[[Padmavati (poem)|Padmavati]]'', ''Saif al-Mulk Badi uz-Zaman'', ''Haft Paikar'' and ''Sikandarnama''. Alaol gained recognition from other Arakanese poets such as Quraishi Magan Thakur.<ref name=alaol/> There were many other 17th-century poets who were polyglot in a number of languages such as [[Abdul Hakim (poet)|Abdul Hakim]] of [[Sandwip]] and Hayat Mahmud. Shah Faqir Gharibullah of [[Howrah]] was a very prominent Dobhashi writer who is said to have introduced its use in [[Western Bengal]].\n\nMedieval tales of Persian origin such as ''Gul-e-Bakavali'' were being translated to Dobhashi and being popularised in Bengal. Dobhashi puthis about the latter tale were written by the likes of Munshi Ebadat Ali in 1840. Muhammad Fasih was also a renowned Dobhashi [[puthi]] writer who was known to have written a 30-quatrain ''chautisa'' (poetic genre using all letters of the alphabet) using Arabic letters, totalling 120 lines.<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Chautisa|author=[[Wakil Ahmed]]}}</ref>\n\nThe famous Bangladeshi academic, [[Wakil Ahmed]], states that ''Jaiguner Puthi'' (Puthi of Jaigun), written by Syed Hamzah of [[Hugli-Chuchura|Udna, Hooghley]] in 1797, is \"one of the finest examples\" of puthis in Dobhashi. It took inspiration from earlier [[Bengali Muslim]] works such as ''Hanifar Digbijoy'' by Shah Barid Khan and ''Hanifar Lorai'' by Muhammad Khan (1724). Muhammad Khater was a late Dobhashi writer who wrote a [[puthi]] about ill-fated lovers in 1864, taking inspiration from the 16th century Bengali poet [[Dawlat Wazir Bahram Khan]].<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Daulat Uzir Bahram Khan|author=[[Wakil Ahmed]]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[English Education Act 1835]] banned the use of [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in education. [[Nathaniel Brassey Halhed]], an employee of the [[East India Company]], wrote books on Bengali language and considered the Perso-Arab vocabulary as pollutants and dismissed them from his works. Dobhashi is considered to have lost popularity as the [[Nadia district|Nadia]] variant of Bengali (inspired by the highly [[Sanskrit]]ised [[Shadhu-bhasha]]), became more institutionalised by the British, who worked alongside the educated [[Brahmins]] who chose to learn English, and created a standard (shuddho) form of Bengali. In reaction to Sanskritisation, educated Bengali Muslims, refusing to learn English, took to the initiative to revive Dobhashi literature hoping to maintain their identity and linguistic traditions. The dialect came to be known as ''Musalmani Bengali'' since then. In the mid-nineteenth century, printing houses in [[Calcutta]] and across [[Bengal]], were producing hundreds and hundreds of Musalmani Bengali literature. In 1863, [[Nawab Abdul Latif]] founded the [[Mohammedan Literary Society]].<ref name=roots>{{cite book|title=Roots of separatism in nineteenth century Bengal|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12443/page/n5/mode/2up|author=[[Amalendu De]]|year=1974|location=[[Calcutta]]|publisher=Ratna Prakashan}}</ref> The [[Christian Missionaries]] in Bengal also translated [[the Bible]] into what they called \"Musalmani Bangla\" in order for Bengali Muslims, that were uneducated in English and the standardised Bengali, to understand.\n\nNowadays, pure Dobhashi is mostly used for research purposes. Remants of the dialect is present in regional [[dialects of Bengali]], in particular amongst rural Muslim communities. The Standard variant of Bengali used in [[Bangladesh]] contains somewhat more Perso-Arabic vocabulary compared to the Sanskritised standard used in [[West Bengal]]. The 20th century educationist and researcher, Dr Kazi Abdul Mannan (d. 1994), wrote his thesis on ''The Emergence and Development of Dobhasi Literature in Bengal (upto 1855 AD)'' for his [[PhD]] from [[Dhaka University]] in 1966.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abdul Karim Sahitya Bisharad]], historian who discovered hundreds of lost medieval literature and writers\n*[[Bengali Kissa]], popular genre found in Dobhashi literature\n*[[Bengali poetry]]\n*[[Puthi]], popular genre found in Dobhashi literature\n*[[Yusuf-Zulekha]], an early Dobhashi work\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Bengali language}}\n[[Category:Bengali words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Bengali dialects]]\n[[Category:History of Islam in Bangladesh]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2020}}\n{{Infobox language\n|name=Dobhashi\n|region=[[Bengal]], [[Arakan]]\n|era=14th-19th century\n|familycolor=Indo-European\n|fam2=[[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]\n|fam3=[[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]]\n|fam4=[[Indo-Aryan languages#Eastern Zone|Eastern]]\n|fam5=[[Bengali-Assamese languages|Bengali-Assamese]]\n|fam6=[[Bengali language|Bengali]]\n|isoexception=historical\n|notice=Indic\n}}[[File:Halot-un-nabi-page1.gif|thumb|A puthi called Halat-un-Nabi written by [[Sadeq Ali]] in the [[Sylheti Nagri]] script.]]{{Islam in Bangladesh}}\n'''Dobhashi''' ({{lang-bn|\u09a6\u09cb\u09ad\u09be\u09b7\u09c0|D\u014dbh\u0101\u1e63\u012b}}, [[Sylheti Nagri|Sylheti]]: {{font|\ua816\ua825\ua81c\ua823\ua821\ua824|font=Surma|size=18px}}, ''Dubhashi'', [[Perso-Arabic alphabet|Perso-Arab]]: \u062f\u0648\u0628\u06be\u0627\u0634\u06cc lit.

Alaol's works included ''[[Padmavati (poem)|Padmavati]]'', ''Saif al-Mulk Badi uz-Zaman'', ''Haft Paikar'' and ''Sikandarnama''. Alaol gained recognition from other Arakanese poets such as Quraishi Magan Thakur.<ref name=alaol/> There were many other 17th-century poets who were polyglot in a number of languages such as [[Abdul Hakim (poet)|Abdul Hakim]] of [[Sandwip]] and Hayat Mahmud. Shah Faqir Gharibullah of [[Howrah]] was a very prominent Dobhashi writer who is said to have introduced its use in [[Western Bengal]].\n\nMedieval tales of Persian origin such as ''Gul-e-Bakavali'' were being translated to Dobhashi and being popularised in Bengal. Dobhashi puthis about the latter tale were written by the likes of Munshi Ebadat Ali in 1840. Muhammad Fasih was also a renowned Dobhashi [[puthi]] writer who was known to have written a 30-quatrain ''chautisa'' (poetic genre using all letters of the alphabet) using Arabic letters, totalling 120 lines.<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Chautisa|author=[[Wakil Ahmed]]}}</ref>\n\nThe famous Bangladeshi academic, [[Wakil Ahmed]], states that ''Jaiguner Puthi'' (Puthi of Jaigun), written by Syed Hamzah of [[Hugli-Chuchura|Udna, Hooghley]] in 1797, is \"one of the finest examples\" of puthis in Dobhashi. It took inspiration from earlier [[Bengali Muslim]] works such as ''Hanifar Digbijoy'' by Shah Barid Khan and ''Hanifar Lorai'' by Muhammad Khan (1724). Muhammad Khater was a late Dobhashi writer who wrote a [[puthi]] about ill-fated lovers in 1864, taking inspiration from the 16th century Bengali poet [[Dawlat Wazir Bahram Khan]].<ref>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Daulat Uzir Bahram Khan|author=[[Wakil Ahmed]]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[English Education Act 1835]] banned the use of [[Farsi|Persian]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in education. [[Nathaniel Brassey Halhed]], an employee of the [[East India Company]], wrote books on Bengali language and considered the Perso-Arab vocabulary as pollutants and dismissed them from his works. Dobhashi is considered to have lost popularity as the [[Nadia district|Nadia]] variant of Bengali (inspired by the highly [[Sanskrit]]ised [[Shadhu-bhasha]]), became more institutionalised by the British, who worked alongside the educated [[Brahmins]] who chose to learn English, and created a standard (shuddho) form of Bengali. In reaction to Sanskritisation, educated Bengali Muslims, refusing to learn English, took to the initiative to revive Dobhashi literature hoping to maintain their identity and linguistic traditions. The dialect came to be known as ''Musalmani Bengali'' since then. In the mid-nineteenth century, printing houses in [[Calcutta]] and across [[Bengal]], were producing hundreds and hundreds of Musalmani Bengali literature. In 1863, [[Nawab Abdul Latif]] founded the [[Mohammedan Literary Society]].<ref name=roots>{{cite book|title=Roots of separatism in nineteenth century Bengal|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.12443/page/n5/mode/2up|author=[[Amalendu De]]|year=1974|location=[[Calcutta]]|publisher=Ratna Prakashan}}</ref> The [[Christian Missionaries]] in Bengal also translated [[the Bible]] into what they called \"Musalmani Bangla\" in order for Bengali Muslims, that were uneducated in English and the standardised Bengali, to understand.\n\nNowadays, pure Dobhashi is mostly used for research purposes. Remants of the dialect is present in regional [[dialects of Bengali]], in particular amongst rural Muslim communities. The Standard variant of Bengali used in [[Bangladesh]] contains somewhat more Perso-Arabic vocabulary compared to the Sanskritised standard used in [[West Bengal]]. The 20th century educationist and researcher, Dr Kazi Abdul Mannan (d. 1994), wrote his thesis on ''The Emergence and Development of Dobhasi Literature in Bengal (upto 1855 AD)'' for his [[PhD]] from [[Dhaka University]] in 1966.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abdul Karim Sahitya Bisharad]], historian who discovered hundreds of lost medieval literature and writers\n*[[Bengali Kissa]], popular genre found in Dobhashi literature\n*[[Bengali poetry]]\n*[[Puthi]], popular genre found in Dobhashi literature\n*[[Yusuf-Zulekha]], an early Dobhashi work\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Bengali language}}\n[[Category:Bengali words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Bengali dialects]]\n[[Category:History of Islam in Bangladesh]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCharacteristics:Fixing links to disambiguation pages, improving links, other minor cleanup tasks", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobhashi"}

In these 52&nbsp;years, India had undergone the [[Sino-Indian War]], the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], as well as increased nuclear danger, the [[Cold War]], persistence of the hybrid war in Kashmir for more than ten years, and a revolution in military affairs elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/idr/vol_15(1)/real_admiral_satyindra_singh.html|title=The Kargil Review Committee Report: Much to Learn and Implement|last=Singh|first=Satyindra|website=South Asia Terrorism Portal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214214045/http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/idr/vol_15(1)/real_admiral_satyindra_singh.html|archive-date=2018-12-14|url-status=live|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIndia tried major defence reforms following the Sino-Indian War in 1962, but these did not address national security in a holistic way.

Chapter&nbsp;5 reconstructs the Kargil intrusion. In Chapter&nbsp;6, the committee outlines the role and function of intelligence agencies.

It clearly states that the intrusion had been a surprise for the Indian government. After elaborating on the history of the \"Kargil plan\", the committee discusses the government's, army's, and media's respective responses. They then outline the intelligence findings, elaborating on the role of the [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (R&AW), [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] and the military intelligence collection just prior to the war, as well as the lack of inter-agency coordination. The Kargil Review Committee found R&AW\u2018s human intelligence to be weak,<ref name=\":7\" /> but Chapter&nbsp;14 also praises the interception of telephone conversations of [[Pervez Musharraf|Pervej Musharraf]] in China.

The recommendations of the KRC report and the GoM report led to far-reaching changes in the Indian security apparatus.\n\n== Background ==\nThe Kargil Review Committee laid out the context of the report.

In these 52&nbsp;years, India had undergone the [[Sino-Indian War]], the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]], and the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], as well as increased nuclear danger, the [[Cold War]], persistence of the hybrid war in Kashmir for more than ten years, and a revolution in military affairs elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/idr/vol_15(1)/real_admiral_satyindra_singh.html|title=The Kargil Review Committee Report: Much to Learn and Implement|last=Singh|first=Satyindra|website=South Asia Terrorism Portal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181214214045/http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/idr/vol_15(1)/real_admiral_satyindra_singh.html|archive-date=2018-12-14|url-status=live|access-date=2018-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIndia tried major defence reforms following the Sino-Indian War in 1962, but these did not address national security in a holistic way.

Chapter&nbsp;5 reconstructs the Kargil intrusion. In Chapter&nbsp;6, the committee outlines the role and function of intelligence agencies. Chapters&nbsp;7 and 8 discusses and analyses intelligence on the Kargil issue, as well as the army's subsequent response.

It clearly states that the intrusion had been a surprise for the Indian government. After elaborating on the history of the \"Kargil plan\", the committee discusses the government's, army's, and media's respective responses. They then outline the intelligence findings, elaborating on the role of the [[Research and Analysis Wing]] (R&AW), [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] and the military intelligence collection just prior to the war, as well as the lack of inter-agency coordination. The Kargil Review Committee found R&AW\u2018s human intelligence to be weak,<ref name=\":7\" /> but Chapter&nbsp;14 also praises the interception of telephone conversations of [[Pervez Musharraf|Pervej Musharraf]] in China. The KRC report also acknowledges the work of the [[Aviation Research Centre]] of R&AW, which produced aerial intelligence after the intrusion's detection. The report goes into detail regarding the nuclear, technological and media effects of the incident.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nThe report also mentions that the Kargil War could perhaps have been avoided if troops had been stationed there, but also notes that had troops been stationed there all year round and the conflict had still occurred, it would have resulted in huge costs \"and enabled [[Bleed India with a Thousand Cuts|Pakistan to bleed India]].\"<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Recommendations ===\nThe KRC suggested a \"thorough review of the national security system in its entirety\", conducted by a credible body of experts.
