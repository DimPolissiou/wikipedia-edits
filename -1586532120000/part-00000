They were a loose confederation of several tribes in the 17th century, but today Wampanoag people encompass five officially recognized tribes. The [[Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe]] and the [[Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head]] in [[Massachusetts]] are Federally recognized, and the Herring Pond Wampanoag Tribe, Namasket (or Nemasket) Pokanoket Band, and Pocasset Wampanoag Tribe (Pokonoket) are recognized by the State of Massachusetts.<ref>https://www.mass.gov/service-details/indian-affairs{{cite =\"The Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Commission on Indian Affairs\"</ref> They lived in southeastern Massachusetts and [[Rhode Island]] in the beginning of the 17th century, at the time of first contact with the English colonists, a territory that included the islands of [[Martha's Vineyard]] and [[Nantucket]]. Their population numbered in the thousands; 3,000 Wampanoag lived on Martha's Vineyard alone.\n\nFrom 1615 to 1619, the Wampanoag suffered an epidemic, long suspected to be [[smallpox]]. Modern research, however, has suggested that it may have been [[leptospirosis]], a bacterial infection which can develop into [[Weil's syndrome]]. It caused a high fatality rate and decimated the Wampanoag population. Researchers suggest that the losses from the epidemic were so large that colonists were able to establish their settlements in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] more easily.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/2/281.htm  Marr JS, Cathey JT. \"New hypothesis for cause of an epidemic among Native Americans, New England, 1616\u20131619\"], ''Emerging Infectious Diseases,'' Centers for Disease Control, 2010 Feb {{doi|10.3201/edi1602.090276}}</ref> More than 50 years later, [[King Philip's War]] (1675\u20131676) of Indian allies against the colonists resulted in the death of 40 percent of the surviving tribe. Many male Wampanoag were sold into slavery in [[Bermuda]] or the [[West Indies]], and some women and children were enslaved by colonists in [[New England]].\n\nThe tribe largely disappeared from historical records after the late 18th century, although its people and descendants persisted. Survivors continued to live in their traditional areas and maintained many aspects of their culture, while absorbing other peoples by marriage and adapting to changing economic and cultural needs in the larger society. The last speakers of the [[Massachusett language]] ''W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak'' died more than 100 years ago, although some Wampanoag people have been working on a language revival project since 1993.\n\n==Name==\n[[File:Wpdms aq block 1614.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|Block's map of his 1614 voyage, with the first appearance of the term \"[[New Netherland]]\"]]\n''Wampanoag'' is probably derived from ''Wapanoos'', first documented on [[Adriaen Block]]'s 1614 map, which was the earliest European representation of Wampanoag territory.

The women cultivated varieties of the \"[[Three Sisters (agriculture)|three sisters]]\" (maize, climbing beans, and squash) as the staples of their diet, supplemented by fish and game caught by the men.<ref name=\"hosm\" /> Each community had authority over a well-defined territory from which the people derived their livelihood through a seasonal round of fishing, planting, harvesting, and hunting. Southern New England was populated by various tribes, so hunting grounds had strictly defined boundaries.\n\nThe Wampanoag had a [[matrilineal]] system, like many [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands]], in which women controlled property, and hereditary status was passed through the maternal line. They were also [[matrifocal]]; when a young couple married, they lived with the woman's family. Women elders could approve selection of chiefs or sachems. Men acted in most of the political roles for relations with other bands and tribes, as well as warfare. Women passed plots of land to their female descendants, regardless of their marital status.<ref>Plane, Anne Marie. ''Colonial Intimacies: Indian Marriage in Early New England''. (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press), 2000: 20, 61.</ref>\n\nThe production of food among the Wampanoag was similar to that of many American Indian societies, and food habits were divided along gender lines. Men and women had specific tasks. Women played an active role in many of the stages of food production, so they had important socio-political, economic, and spiritual roles in their communities.<ref name=\"HNAI\">''Handbook of North American Indians.''</ref> Wampanoag men were mainly responsible for hunting and fishing, while women took care of farming and gathering wild fruits, nuts, berries, and shellfish.<ref>See Bragdon, Kathleen, \"Gender as a Social Category in Native Southern New England,\" ''Ethnohistory'' 43:4, 1996, p. 576, and Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 20.</ref> Women were responsible for up to 75 percent of all food production in Wampanoag societies.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 20.</ref><ref name=\"hosm\" />\n\nThe Wampanoag were organized into a confederation where a head sachem presided over a number of other sachems. The colonists often referred to him as \"king\", but the position of a sachem differed in many ways from a king. They were selected by women elders and were bound to consult their own councilors within their tribe, as well as any of the \"petty sachems\" in the region.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 23.</ref> They were also responsible for arranging trade privileges, as well as protecting their allies in exchange for material tribute.<ref>Salisbury, Neal.

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pp. 171f</ref>\n\nPre-marital sexual experimentation was accepted, although the Wampanoag expected fidelity within unions after marriage. [[Roger Williams]] (1603\u20131683) stated that \"single fornication they count no sin, but after Marriage\u2026 they count it heinous for either of them to be false.\"<ref>Williams, Roger. ''Narrangansett Women''.  (Originally published 1643, cited from Woloch, N., ed., ''Early American Women: A Documentary History, 1600\u20131900'' (New York: McGraw-Hill), 1997, p. 8).</ref> Polygamy was practiced among the Wampanoag, although monogamy was the norm. Some elite men could take several wives for political or social reasons, and multiple wives were a symbol of wealth because women were the producers and distributors of corn and other food products. Marriage and conjugal unions were not as important as ties of clan and kinship.\n\n==Language revival==\n[[File:Eliot Bible.jpg|200px|thumb|Title page of the first Bible printed in the United States, translated in the Massachusett language by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]]]]\nThe Wampanoag originally spoke W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak, a dialect of the [[Massachusett language]] which belongs to the [[Algonquian languages]] family.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The [[Mamusse Wunneetupantamwe Um Biblum God|first Bible published in America]] was a 1663 translation into Wampanoag by missionary [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]]. He created an orthography which he taught to the Wampanoag. Many became literate, using Wampanoag for letters, deeds, and historic documents.<ref name=\"Mifflin\"/>\n\nThe rapid decline of Wampanoag speakers began after the [[American Revolution]]. Neal Salisbury and Colin G. Calloway suggest that New England Indian communities suffered from gender imbalances at this time due to premature male deaths, especially due to warfare and their work in whaling and shipping. They posit that many Wampanoag women married outside their linguistic groups, making it difficult for them to maintain the various Wampanoag dialects.<ref>Salisbury, Neal and Colin G. Calloway, eds.

The ''W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak'' (Wampanoag) Language Reclamation Project is a collaboration of several tribes and bands led by [[Jessie Little Doe Baird]].

A [[Patuxet]] named [[Tisquantum]] (or [[Squanto]]) was bought by Spanish monks who attempted to convert him before setting him free. He accompanied an expedition to Newfoundland as an interpreter, then made his way back to his homeland in 1619\u2014only to discover that the entire Patuxet tribe had died in an epidemic.<ref name=\"DWI\">''Die Welt der Indianer.''</ref>\n\nIn 1620, the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] arrived in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], and Tisquantum and other Wampanoag taught them how to cultivate the varieties of corn, squash, and beans (the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]) that flourished in New England, as well as how to catch and process fish and collect seafood. They enabled the Pilgrims to survive their first winters, and Squanto lived with them and acted as a middleman between them and ''[[Massasoit]]'', the Wampanoag [[sachem]].\n\nThe Wampanoag suffered from an epidemic between 1616 and 1619, long thought to be smallpox introduced by contact with Europeans. However, researchers published a study in 2010 suggesting that the epidemic was [[leptospirosis]], or 7-day fever.<ref name=\"Marr JS, Cathey JT 281\u20136\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marr JS, Cathey JT |title=New hypothesis for cause of an epidemic among Native Americans, New England, 1616\u20131619 |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=16 |issue=2 |date=February 2010 |doi=10.3201/eid1602.090276 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/2/281.htm |pages=281\u20136 |pmid=20113559 |pmc=2957993 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130082204/http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/2/281.htm |archivedate=30 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The groups most devastated by the illness were those who had traded heavily with the French, leading to speculation that the disease was a [[virgin soil epidemic]].

In 1632, the [[Narragansett people|Narragansetts]] attacked Massasoit's village in ''[[Warren, Rhode Island|Sowam]]'', but the colonists helped the Wampanoag to drive them back.<ref name=\"DWI\" />\n\n[[File:Plymouthkolonie.jpg|thumb|Seal of Plymouth Colony]]\n\nAfter 1630, the members of Plymouth Colony became outnumbered by the growing number of Puritans settling around Boston. The colonists expanded westward into the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. In 1637, they destroyed the powerful [[Pequot]] Confederation. In 1643, the [[Mohegan]]s defeated the Narragansetts in a war with support from the colonists, and they became the dominant tribe in southern New England.<ref name=\"DWI\" />\n\n=== Conversion to Christianity ===\nAfter 1650, [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and other Puritan missionaries sought to convert Indians to Christianity, and the converted Indians settled in 14 \"praying towns.\" Eliot and his colleagues hoped that the Indians would adopt practices such as monogamous marriage, agriculture, and jurisprudence.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' pp. 47\u201348.</ref> The high levels of epidemics among the Indians may have motivated some conversions. Salisbury suggests that the survivors suffered a type of spiritual crisis because their medical and religious leaders had been unable to prevent the epidemic losses.<ref>Salisbury, ''Manitou and Providence,'' p. 106.</ref> By the latter half of the seventeenth century, alcoholism had become rampant among Indian men. Many turned for help to Christianity and Christian discipline systems. Christianity also became a refuge for women from drunkenness, with its insistence upon temperance and systems of retribution for drunkenness.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Old Indian Meetinghouse.jpg|thumb|right|\"[[Old Indian Meeting House]]\" built in 1684 in [[Mashpee, Massachusetts]], the oldest Indian church building in the United States]]\n\nIndividual towns and regions had differing expectations for Indian conversions. In most of Eliot's mainland \"praying towns,\" religious converts were also expected to follow colonial laws and manners, and to adopt the material trappings of colonial life. Eliot and other ministers relied on praise and rewards for those who conformed, rather than punishing those who did not.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 48.</ref> The Christian Indian settlements of [[Martha's Vineyard]] were noted for a great deal of sharing and mixing between Wampanoag and colonial ways of life. Wampanoag converts often continued their traditional practices in dress, hairstyle, and governance. The Martha's Vineyard converts were not required to attend church and they often maintained traditional cultural practices, such as mourning rituals.<ref>Ronda, James P. \"Generations of Faith: The Christian Indians of Martha\u2019s Vineyard\", ''William and Mary Quarterly 38'', 1981, p. 378.</ref>\n\nThe Wampanoag women were more likely to convert to Christianity than the men. [[Experience Mayhew]] said that \"it seems to be a Truth with respect to our Indians, so far as my knowledge of them extend, that there have been, and are a greater number of their Women appearing pious than of the men among them\" in his text \"Indian Converts\".<ref>Quoted from James Ronda, ''Generations of Faith,'' p. 384\u201388</ref> The frequency of female conversion created a problem for missionaries, who wanted to establish patriarchal family and societal structures among them. Women had control of property, and inheritance and descent passed through their line, including hereditary leadership for men. Wampanoag women on Martha's Vineyard were the spiritual leaders of their households. In general, English ministers agreed that it was preferable for women to subvert the patriarchal model and assume a dominant spiritual role than it was for their husbands to remain unconverted. Experience Mayhew asked, \"How can those Wives answer it unto God who do not Use their utmost Endeavors to Perswade and oblige their husbands to maintain Prayer in their families?\"<ref>Experience Mayhew, sermon, \"Family Religion Excited and Assisted,\" 1714\u201328, quoted from Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 114</ref> In some cases, Wampanoag women converts accepted changed gender roles under colonial custom, while others practiced their traditional roles of shared power as Christians.\n\n=== Metacomet (King Philip) ===\n\n[[File:Philip King of Mount Hope by Paul Revere.jpeg|thumb|right|''Philip, King of Mount Hope'', 1772, by [[Paul Revere]]]]\nMassasoit was among those Indians who adopted colonial customs. He asked the legislators in Plymouth near the end of his life to give both of his sons English names. The older son [[Wamsutta]] was given the name Alexander, and his younger brother [[Metacom]] was named Philip. After his father's death, Alexander became the sachem of the Wampanoag. The colonists invited him to Plymouth to talk, but Wamsutta became seriously ill on the way home and died shortly after. The Wampanoag were told that he died of fever, but many Indians thought that he had been poisoned. The following year, his brother Philip (Metacom) became sachem of the Wampanoag.<ref name=\"hist\">[http://www.tolatsga.org/wampa.html Wampanoag History]</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}\n\nUnder Philip's leadership, the relationship changed dramatically between the Wampanoag and the colonists. Philip believed that the ever-increasing colonists would eventually take over everything\u2014not only land, but also their culture, their way of life, and their religion, and he decided to limit the further expansion of colonial settlements. The Wampanoag numbered only 1,000, and Philip began to visit other tribes to build alliances among those who also wanted to push out the colonists. At that time, the number of colonists in southern New England already numbered more than double that of the Indians\u201435,000 vs. 15,000. In 1671, Philip was called to [[Taunton, Massachusetts]] where he listened to the accusations of the colonists and signed an agreement that required the Wampanoag to give up their firearms. To be on the safe side, he did not take part in the subsequent dinner. His men never delivered their weapons.<ref name=\"hist\" />{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}\n\nPhilip gradually gained the [[Nipmuck]], [[Pocomtuc]], and Narragansett as allies, and the beginning of the uprising was first planned for the spring of 1676. In March 1675, however, [[John Sassamon]] was murdered.<ref>For a much more detailed examination of John Sassamon, his murder, and its effects on King Philip's War, see Jill Lepore's ''The Name of War''.</ref> Sassamon was a Christian Indian raised in Natick, one of the \"praying towns.\" He was educated at [[Harvard College]] and had served as a scribe, interpreter, and counselor to Philip and the Wampanoag. But, a week before his death, Sassamon reported to Plymouth governor [[Josiah Winslow]] that Philip was planning a war against the colonists.\n\nSassamon was found dead under the ice of Assawompsett Pond a week later; three Wampanoag warriors were accused of his murder by a Christian Indian and taken captive by the colonists; they were hanged in June 1675 after a trial by a jury of 12 colonists and six Christian Indians. This execution was a catalyst for war, combined with rumors that the colonists wanted to capture Philip. Philip called a council of war on Mount Hope; most Wampanoag wanted to follow him, with the exception of the [[Nauset]] on [[Cape Cod]] and the small groups on the offshore islands. Allies included the Nipmuck, Pocomtuc, and some [[Pennacook]] and eastern [[Abenaki]] from farther north. The Narragansett remained neutral at the beginning of the war.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to ''Mary Rowlandson,'' p. 21.</ref>\n\n=== King Philip's War ===\n{{Main|King Philip's War}}\nOn June 20, 1675, some Wampanoags attacked colonists in [[Swansea, Massachusetts]] and laid siege to the town; they destroyed it completely five days later, leading ultimately to [[King Philip's War]]. The united tribes in southern New England attacked 52 of 90 colonial settlements, and partially burned them down.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, many Indians offered to fight with the colonists against King Philip and his allies, serving as warriors, scouts, advisers, and spies. Mistrust and hostility eventually caused the colonists to discontinue Indian assistance, even though they were invaluable in the war. The Massachusetts government moved many Christian Indians to [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]] in [[Boston Harbor]], in part to protect the \"praying Indians\" from vigilantes, but also as a precautionary measure to prevent rebellion and sedition from them.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 23.</ref> [[Mary Rowlandson]]'s [[A Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson|''The Sovereignty and Goodness of God'']] is an account of her months of captivity by the Wampanoag during King Philip's War in which she expressed shock at the cruelties from Christian Indians.<ref>See Mary Rowlandson, The Sovereignty and Goodness of God, pp. 75 and 98.</ref>\n\nFrom Massachusetts, the war spread to other parts of New England. The Kennebec, Pigwacket ([[Pequawket]]s), and [[Androscoggin people|Arosaguntacook]] from Maine joined in the war against the colonists. The Narragansetts of [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] gave up their neutrality after the colonists attacked one of their fortified villages. The Narragansetts lost more than 600 people and 20 sachems in the battle which became known as the \"[[Great Swamp Massacre]]\". Their leader Canonchet was able to flee and led a large group of Narragansett warriors west to join King Philip's warriors.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nThe war turned against Philip in the spring of 1676, following a winter of hunger and deprivation. The colonial troops set out after him, and Canonchet was taken captive and executed by a firing squad. Canonchet's corpse was quartered, and his head was sent to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to be put on public display.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nDuring the summer months, Philip escaped from his pursuers and went to a hideout on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope]] in Rhode Island. Colonial forces attacked in August, killing and capturing 173 Wampanoags. Philip barely escaped capture, but his wife and their nine-year-old son were captured and put on a ship at Plymouth; they were then sold as slaves in the [[West Indies]]. On August 12, 1676, colonial troops surrounded Philip's camp, and soon shot and killed him.\n\n=== Consequences of the war ===\nWith the death of Philip and most of their leaders, the Wampanoags were nearly exterminated; only about 400 survived the war. The Narragansetts and [[Nipmuck]]s suffered similar rates of losses, and many small tribes in southern New England were finished. In addition, many Wampanoag were sold into slavery. Male captives were generally sold to slave traders and transported to the West Indies, [[Bermuda]], [[Virginia]], or the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The colonists used the women and children as slaves or indentured servants in New England, depending on the colony. Massachusetts resettled the remaining Wampanoags in [[Natick]], Wamesit, Punkapoag, and Hassanamesit, four of the original 14 praying towns. These were the only ones to be resettled after the war.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 37.</ref> Overall, approximately 5,000 Indians (40 percent of their population) and 2,500 colonists (5 percent) were killed in King Philip's War.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 1.</ref>\n\n===18th to 20th century===\n\n==== Mashpee ====\nThe exception to relocation was the coastal islands' Wampanoag groups, who had stayed neutral through the war.  The colonists forced the Wampanoag of the mainland to resettle with the Saconnet (Sekonnet), or with the [[Nauset]] into the praying towns in [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable County]]. [[Mashpee, Massachusetts|Mashpee]] is the largest [[Indian reservation|reservation]] set aside in Massachusetts, and is located on [[Cape Cod]]. In 1660, the colonists allotted the Indians about {{convert|50|sqmi|km2}} there, and beginning in 1665 they had self-government, adopting an English-style court of law and trials. The area was integrated into the district of Mashpee in 1763.\n\nIn 1788 after the [[American Revolutionary War]], the state revoked the Wampanoag ability to self-govern, considering it a failure. It appointed a supervisory committee consisting of five European-American members, with no Wampanoag.  In 1834, the state returned a certain degree of self-government to the First Nations People, and although the First Nations People were far from autonomous, they continued in this manner.  To support assimilation, in 1842 the state violated the [[Nonintercourse Act]] when it illegally allocated plots from {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of their communal {{convert|13000|acre|km2}}, to be distributed in {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcels to each household for subsistence farming, although New England communities were adopting other types of economies.  The state passed laws to try to control white encroachment on the reservation; some stole wood from its forests. A large region, once rich in wood, fish and game, it was considered highly desirable by the whites. With competition between whites and the Wampanoag, conflicts were more frequent than for more isolated Indian settlements elsewhere in the state.\n\n==== Wampanoag on Martha's Vineyard ====\nOn Martha's Vineyard in the 18th and 19th centuries, there were three reservations\u2014[[Chappaquiddick Island|Chappaquiddick]], Christiantown and [[Gay Head]]. The Chappaquiddick Reservation was part of a small island of the same name and was located on the eastern point of that island. As the result of the sale of land in 1789, the Indians lost valuable areas, and the remaining land was distributed among the Indian residents in 1810. In 1823 the laws were changed, in order to hinder those trying to get rid of the Indians and to implement a visible beginning of a civic organization. Around 1849, they owned {{convert|692|acre|km2}} of infertile land, and many of the residents moved to nearby [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]], so that they could practice a trade and obtain some civil rights.<ref name=\"HNAIff\">''Handbook of North American Indians.'' Chapter: Indians of Southern New England and Long Island, late period, pp. 178ff; [http://www.seaconkewampanoagtribe.org Seaconke Wampanoag Tribe webpage]; [http://mashpeewampanoagtribe.com/ Mashpee Wampanoag Nation webpage]; [http://www.wampanoagtribe.org Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah webpage]</ref>\n\nChristiantown was originally a \"praying town\" on the northwest side of Martha's Vineyard, northwest of [[Tisbury, Massachusetts|Tisbury]]. In 1849 the reservation still consisted of {{convert|390|acre|km2}}, of which all but 10 were distributed among the residents. The land, kept under community ownership, yielded very few crops and the tribe members left it to get paying jobs in the cities. Wampanoag [[oral history]] tells that Christiantown was wiped out in 1888 by a [[smallpox]] epidemic.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\nThe third reservation on Martha's Vineyard was constructed in 1711 by the [[New England Company]] (founded in 1649) to Christianize the Indians. They bought land for the Gay Head Indians who had lived there since before 1642. There was considerable dispute about how the land should be cultivated, as the colony had leased the better sections to the whites at low interest. The original goal of creating an undisturbed center for missionary work was quickly forgotten. The state finally created a reservation on a peninsula on the western point of Martha's Vineyard and named it Gay Head. This region was connected to the main island by an isthmus; it enabled the isolation desired by the Wampanoag. In 1849 they had {{convert|2400|acre|km2}} there, of which 500 acres were distributed among the tribe members. The rest was communal property. In contrast to the other reservation groups, the tribe had no guardian or headman. When they needed advice on legal questions, they asked the guardian of the Chappaquiddick Reservation, but other matters they handled themselves. The band used [[usufruct]] title, meaning that members had no legal claim to their land and allowed the tribal members free rein over their choice of land, as well as over cultivation and building, in order to make their ownership clear. They did not allow whites to settle on their land.  They made strict laws regulating membership in the tribe. As a result, they were able to strengthen the groups' ties to each other, and they did not lose their tribal identity until long after other groups had lost theirs.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\nThe Wampanoag on [[Nantucket Island]] were almost completely destroyed by an unknown [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1763; the last Nantucket Wampanoag died in 1855.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\n==Current status==\n[[File:Plimoth Plantation Native American Wigwam.jpg|thumb|right|Wampanoag educator at [[Plimoth Plantation]]]]\nSlightly more than 2,000 Wampanoag are counted as enrolled members of the nation today (many have ancestry including other tribes and races), and many live near the [[Indian reservation|reservation]] (Watuppa Wampanoag Reservation) on Martha's Vineyard, in [[Dukes County, Massachusetts|Dukes County]]. It is located in the town of [[Aquinnah, Massachusetts|Aquinnah]] (formerly known as Gay Head), at the extreme western part of the island. It has a land area of {{convert|1.952|km2|acre}}, and a [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] resident population of 91 persons.\n\nSeveral bands of the Wampanoag have organized governments: Aquinnah of Gay Head, Assonet, Herring Pond, Mashpee, Pocasset, Pokonoket and Seekonk. Only the Aquinnah and Mashpee bands have gained federal recognition, although the other bands are recognized by the state of Massachusetts and have also applied for federal recognition as tribes.\n\nSome genealogy experts testified that the tribes did not demonstrate the required continuity since historic times.  For instance, in his testimony to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the historian Francis Hutchins said that the Mashpee \"were not an Indian tribe in the years 1666, 1680, 1763, 1790, 1834, 1870, and 1970, or at any time between 1666 and 1970 (Day 36, 130\u2013140). In his opinion, an Indian tribe was \"an entity composed of persons of American Indian descent, which entity possesses distinct political, legal, cultural attributes, which attributes have descended directly from aboriginal precursors.\" (Day 36, 124). Without accounting for cultural change, adaptation, and the effects of non-Indian society, Hutchins argued the Mashpee were not an Indian tribe historically because they adopted Christianity and non-Indian forms of dress and appearance, and chose to remain in Massachusetts as \"second-class\" citizens rather than emigrating westward (note: to Indian Territory) to \"resume tribal existence.\" Hutchins also noted that they intermarried with non-Indians to create a \"non-white,\" or \"colored,\" community (Day 36, 130\u2013140). Hutchins appeared to require unchanged culture, including maintenance of a traditional religion and essentially total social autonomy from non-Indian society.\"<ref>[http://mashpeewampanoagtribe.com/mashpee_final_determination.pdf \"Testimony of Historian Francis Hutchins\"], ''Mashpee Wampanoag Final Determination,'' 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Wampanoag federally recognized tribes ===\n\n==== Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) ====\n{{Main|Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head}}\n[[File:WampanoagWhaler.jpg|thumb|right|Amos Hoskins, an Aquinnah Wampanoag Whaling Captain]]\nThe Aquinnah (''\"land under the hill\"''<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADDCA7494773F9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM ''Boston Globe'', May 15, 1997]</ref><ref>[http://www.cradleboard.org/cnat/profiles/wanpanoag.htm \"Wampanoag\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200624/http://www.cradleboard.org/cnat/profiles/wanpanoag.htm |date=October 29, 2013 }} ''[[Cradleboard Teaching Project]]''.

Modern research, however, has suggested that it may have been [[leptospirosis]], a bacterial infection which can develop into [[Weil's syndrome]]. It caused a high fatality rate and decimated the Wampanoag population.

Southern New England was populated by various tribes, so hunting grounds had strictly defined boundaries.\n\nThe Wampanoag had a [[matrilineal]] system, like many [[indigenous peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands]], in which women controlled property, and hereditary status was passed through the maternal line. They were also [[matrifocal]]; when a young couple married, they lived with the woman's family. Women elders could approve selection of chiefs or sachems. Men acted in most of the political roles for relations with other bands and tribes, as well as warfare. Women passed plots of land to their female descendants, regardless of their marital status.<ref>Plane, Anne Marie. ''Colonial Intimacies: Indian Marriage in Early New England''. (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press), 2000: 20, 61.</ref>\n\nThe production of food among the Wampanoag was similar to that of many American Indian societies, and food habits were divided along gender lines. Men and women had specific tasks. Women played an active role in many of the stages of food production, so they had important socio-political, economic, and spiritual roles in their communities.<ref name=\"HNAI\">''Handbook of North American Indians.''</ref> Wampanoag men were mainly responsible for hunting and fishing, while women took care of farming and gathering wild fruits, nuts, berries, and shellfish.<ref>See Bragdon, Kathleen, \"Gender as a Social Category in Native Southern New England,\" ''Ethnohistory'' 43:4, 1996, p. 576, and Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 20.</ref> Women were responsible for up to 75 percent of all food production in Wampanoag societies.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 20.</ref><ref name=\"hosm\" />\n\nThe Wampanoag were organized into a confederation where a head sachem presided over a number of other sachems.

Some elite men could take several wives for political or social reasons, and multiple wives were a symbol of wealth because women were the producers and distributors of corn and other food products. Marriage and conjugal unions were not as important as ties of clan and kinship.\n\n==Language revival==\n[[File:Eliot Bible.jpg|200px|thumb|Title page of the first Bible printed in the United States, translated in the Massachusett language by [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]]]]\nThe Wampanoag originally spoke W\u00f4pan\u00e2ak, a dialect of the [[Massachusett language]] which belongs to the [[Algonquian languages]] family.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} The [[Mamusse Wunneetupantamwe Um Biblum God|first Bible published in America]] was a 1663 translation into Wampanoag by missionary [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]].

Many became literate, using Wampanoag for letters, deeds, and historic documents.<ref name=\"Mifflin\"/>\n\nThe rapid decline of Wampanoag speakers began after the [[American Revolution]]. Neal Salisbury and Colin G. Calloway suggest that New England Indian communities suffered from gender imbalances at this time due to premature male deaths, especially due to warfare and their work in whaling and shipping. They posit that many Wampanoag women married outside their linguistic groups, making it difficult for them to maintain the various Wampanoag dialects.<ref>Salisbury, Neal and Colin G. Calloway, eds.

Captain Thomas Hunt captured several Wampanoag in 1614 and sold them in Spain as slaves. A [[Patuxet]] named [[Tisquantum]] (or [[Squanto]]) was bought by Spanish monks who attempted to convert him before setting him free. He accompanied an expedition to Newfoundland as an interpreter, then made his way back to his homeland in 1619\u2014only to discover that the entire Patuxet tribe had died in an epidemic.<ref name=\"DWI\">''Die Welt der Indianer.''</ref>\n\nIn 1620, the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] arrived in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]], and Tisquantum and other Wampanoag taught them how to cultivate the varieties of corn, squash, and beans (the [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|Three Sisters]]) that flourished in New England, as well as how to catch and process fish and collect seafood. They enabled the Pilgrims to survive their first winters, and Squanto lived with them and acted as a middleman between them and ''[[Massasoit]]'', the Wampanoag [[sachem]].\n\nThe Wampanoag suffered from an epidemic between 1616 and 1619, long thought to be smallpox introduced by contact with Europeans. However, researchers published a study in 2010 suggesting that the epidemic was [[leptospirosis]], or 7-day fever.<ref name=\"Marr JS, Cathey JT 281\u20136\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Marr JS, Cathey JT |title=New hypothesis for cause of an epidemic among Native Americans, New England, 1616\u20131619 |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=16 |issue=2 |date=February 2010 |doi=10.3201/eid1602.090276 |url=https://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/2/281.htm |pages=281\u20136 |pmid=20113559 |pmc=2957993 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130082204/http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/16/2/281.htm |archivedate=30 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The groups most devastated by the illness were those who had traded heavily with the French, leading to speculation that the disease was a [[virgin soil epidemic]].

The colonists expanded westward into the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. In 1637, they destroyed the powerful [[Pequot]] Confederation. In 1643, the [[Mohegan]]s defeated the Narragansetts in a war with support from the colonists, and they became the dominant tribe in southern New England.<ref name=\"DWI\" />\n\n=== Conversion to Christianity ===\nAfter 1650, [[John Eliot (missionary)|John Eliot]] and other Puritan missionaries sought to convert Indians to Christianity, and the converted Indians settled in 14 \"praying towns.\" Eliot and his colleagues hoped that the Indians would adopt practices such as monogamous marriage, agriculture, and jurisprudence.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' pp. 47\u201348.</ref> The high levels of epidemics among the Indians may have motivated some conversions. Salisbury suggests that the survivors suffered a type of spiritual crisis because their medical and religious leaders had been unable to prevent the epidemic losses.<ref>Salisbury, ''Manitou and Providence,'' p. 106.</ref> By the latter half of the seventeenth century, alcoholism had become rampant among Indian men. Many turned for help to Christianity and Christian discipline systems. Christianity also became a refuge for women from drunkenness, with its insistence upon temperance and systems of retribution for drunkenness.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Old Indian Meetinghouse.jpg|thumb|right|\"[[Old Indian Meeting House]]\" built in 1684 in [[Mashpee, Massachusetts]], the oldest Indian church building in the United States]]\n\nIndividual towns and regions had differing expectations for Indian conversions. In most of Eliot's mainland \"praying towns,\" religious converts were also expected to follow colonial laws and manners, and to adopt the material trappings of colonial life. Eliot and other ministers relied on praise and rewards for those who conformed, rather than punishing those who did not.<ref>Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 48.</ref> The Christian Indian settlements of [[Martha's Vineyard]] were noted for a great deal of sharing and mixing between Wampanoag and colonial ways of life. Wampanoag converts often continued their traditional practices in dress, hairstyle, and governance. The Martha's Vineyard converts were not required to attend church and they often maintained traditional cultural practices, such as mourning rituals.<ref>Ronda, James P. \"Generations of Faith: The Christian Indians of Martha\u2019s Vineyard\", ''William and Mary Quarterly 38'', 1981, p. 378.</ref>\n\nThe Wampanoag women were more likely to convert to Christianity than the men. [[Experience Mayhew]] said that \"it seems to be a Truth with respect to our Indians, so far as my knowledge of them extend, that there have been, and are a greater number of their Women appearing pious than of the men among them\" in his text \"Indian Converts\".<ref>Quoted from James Ronda, ''Generations of Faith,'' p. 384\u201388</ref> The frequency of female conversion created a problem for missionaries, who wanted to establish patriarchal family and societal structures among them. Women had control of property, and inheritance and descent passed through their line, including hereditary leadership for men. Wampanoag women on Martha's Vineyard were the spiritual leaders of their households. In general, English ministers agreed that it was preferable for women to subvert the patriarchal model and assume a dominant spiritual role than it was for their husbands to remain unconverted. Experience Mayhew asked, \"How can those Wives answer it unto God who do not Use their utmost Endeavors to Perswade and oblige their husbands to maintain Prayer in their families?\"<ref>Experience Mayhew, sermon, \"Family Religion Excited and Assisted,\" 1714\u201328, quoted from Plane, ''Colonial Intimacies,'' p. 114</ref> In some cases, Wampanoag women converts accepted changed gender roles under colonial custom, while others practiced their traditional roles of shared power as Christians.\n\n=== Metacomet (King Philip) ===\n\n[[File:Philip King of Mount Hope by Paul Revere.jpeg|thumb|right|''Philip, King of Mount Hope'', 1772, by [[Paul Revere]]]]\nMassasoit was among those Indians who adopted colonial customs. He asked the legislators in Plymouth near the end of his life to give both of his sons English names. The older son [[Wamsutta]] was given the name Alexander, and his younger brother [[Metacom]] was named Philip. After his father's death, Alexander became the sachem of the Wampanoag. The colonists invited him to Plymouth to talk, but Wamsutta became seriously ill on the way home and died shortly after. The Wampanoag were told that he died of fever, but many Indians thought that he had been poisoned. The following year, his brother Philip (Metacom) became sachem of the Wampanoag.<ref name=\"hist\">[http://www.tolatsga.org/wampa.html Wampanoag History]</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}\n\nUnder Philip's leadership, the relationship changed dramatically between the Wampanoag and the colonists. Philip believed that the ever-increasing colonists would eventually take over everything\u2014not only land, but also their culture, their way of life, and their religion, and he decided to limit the further expansion of colonial settlements. The Wampanoag numbered only 1,000, and Philip began to visit other tribes to build alliances among those who also wanted to push out the colonists. At that time, the number of colonists in southern New England already numbered more than double that of the Indians\u201435,000 vs. 15,000. In 1671, Philip was called to [[Taunton, Massachusetts]] where he listened to the accusations of the colonists and signed an agreement that required the Wampanoag to give up their firearms. To be on the safe side, he did not take part in the subsequent dinner. His men never delivered their weapons.<ref name=\"hist\" />{{Unreliable source?|date=April 2018}}\n\nPhilip gradually gained the [[Nipmuck]], [[Pocomtuc]], and Narragansett as allies, and the beginning of the uprising was first planned for the spring of 1676. In March 1675, however, [[John Sassamon]] was murdered.<ref>For a much more detailed examination of John Sassamon, his murder, and its effects on King Philip's War, see Jill Lepore's ''The Name of War''.</ref> Sassamon was a Christian Indian raised in Natick, one of the \"praying towns.\" He was educated at [[Harvard College]] and had served as a scribe, interpreter, and counselor to Philip and the Wampanoag. But, a week before his death, Sassamon reported to Plymouth governor [[Josiah Winslow]] that Philip was planning a war against the colonists.\n\nSassamon was found dead under the ice of Assawompsett Pond a week later; three Wampanoag warriors were accused of his murder by a Christian Indian and taken captive by the colonists; they were hanged in June 1675 after a trial by a jury of 12 colonists and six Christian Indians. This execution was a catalyst for war, combined with rumors that the colonists wanted to capture Philip. Philip called a council of war on Mount Hope; most Wampanoag wanted to follow him, with the exception of the [[Nauset]] on [[Cape Cod]] and the small groups on the offshore islands. Allies included the Nipmuck, Pocomtuc, and some [[Pennacook]] and eastern [[Abenaki]] from farther north. The Narragansett remained neutral at the beginning of the war.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to ''Mary Rowlandson,'' p. 21.</ref>\n\n=== King Philip's War ===\n{{Main|King Philip's War}}\nOn June 20, 1675, some Wampanoags attacked colonists in [[Swansea, Massachusetts]] and laid siege to the town; they destroyed it completely five days later, leading ultimately to [[King Philip's War]]. The united tribes in southern New England attacked 52 of 90 colonial settlements, and partially burned them down.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nAt the outbreak of the war, many Indians offered to fight with the colonists against King Philip and his allies, serving as warriors, scouts, advisers, and spies. Mistrust and hostility eventually caused the colonists to discontinue Indian assistance, even though they were invaluable in the war. The Massachusetts government moved many Christian Indians to [[Deer Island (Massachusetts)|Deer Island]] in [[Boston Harbor]], in part to protect the \"praying Indians\" from vigilantes, but also as a precautionary measure to prevent rebellion and sedition from them.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 23.</ref> [[Mary Rowlandson]]'s [[A Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson|''The Sovereignty and Goodness of God'']] is an account of her months of captivity by the Wampanoag during King Philip's War in which she expressed shock at the cruelties from Christian Indians.<ref>See Mary Rowlandson, The Sovereignty and Goodness of God, pp. 75 and 98.</ref>\n\nFrom Massachusetts, the war spread to other parts of New England. The Kennebec, Pigwacket ([[Pequawket]]s), and [[Androscoggin people|Arosaguntacook]] from Maine joined in the war against the colonists. The Narragansetts of [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] gave up their neutrality after the colonists attacked one of their fortified villages. The Narragansetts lost more than 600 people and 20 sachems in the battle which became known as the \"[[Great Swamp Massacre]]\". Their leader Canonchet was able to flee and led a large group of Narragansett warriors west to join King Philip's warriors.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nThe war turned against Philip in the spring of 1676, following a winter of hunger and deprivation. The colonial troops set out after him, and Canonchet was taken captive and executed by a firing squad. Canonchet's corpse was quartered, and his head was sent to [[Hartford, Connecticut]] to be put on public display.<ref name=\"hist\" />\n\nDuring the summer months, Philip escaped from his pursuers and went to a hideout on [[Mount Hope (Rhode Island)|Mount Hope]] in Rhode Island. Colonial forces attacked in August, killing and capturing 173 Wampanoags. Philip barely escaped capture, but his wife and their nine-year-old son were captured and put on a ship at Plymouth; they were then sold as slaves in the [[West Indies]]. On August 12, 1676, colonial troops surrounded Philip's camp, and soon shot and killed him.\n\n=== Consequences of the war ===\nWith the death of Philip and most of their leaders, the Wampanoags were nearly exterminated; only about 400 survived the war. The Narragansetts and [[Nipmuck]]s suffered similar rates of losses, and many small tribes in southern New England were finished. In addition, many Wampanoag were sold into slavery. Male captives were generally sold to slave traders and transported to the West Indies, [[Bermuda]], [[Virginia]], or the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The colonists used the women and children as slaves or indentured servants in New England, depending on the colony. Massachusetts resettled the remaining Wampanoags in [[Natick]], Wamesit, Punkapoag, and Hassanamesit, four of the original 14 praying towns. These were the only ones to be resettled after the war.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 37.</ref> Overall, approximately 5,000 Indians (40 percent of their population) and 2,500 colonists (5 percent) were killed in King Philip's War.<ref>Salisbury, Introduction to Mary Rowlandson, p. 1.</ref>\n\n===18th to 20th century===\n\n==== Mashpee ====\nThe exception to relocation was the coastal islands' Wampanoag groups, who had stayed neutral through the war.  The colonists forced the Wampanoag of the mainland to resettle with the Saconnet (Sekonnet), or with the [[Nauset]] into the praying towns in [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable County]]. [[Mashpee, Massachusetts|Mashpee]] is the largest [[Indian reservation|reservation]] set aside in Massachusetts, and is located on [[Cape Cod]]. In 1660, the colonists allotted the Indians about {{convert|50|sqmi|km2}} there, and beginning in 1665 they had self-government, adopting an English-style court of law and trials. The area was integrated into the district of Mashpee in 1763.\n\nIn 1788 after the [[American Revolutionary War]], the state revoked the Wampanoag ability to self-govern, considering it a failure. It appointed a supervisory committee consisting of five European-American members, with no Wampanoag.  In 1834, the state returned a certain degree of self-government to the First Nations People, and although the First Nations People were far from autonomous, they continued in this manner.  To support assimilation, in 1842 the state violated the [[Nonintercourse Act]] when it illegally allocated plots from {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of their communal {{convert|13000|acre|km2}}, to be distributed in {{convert|60|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcels to each household for subsistence farming, although New England communities were adopting other types of economies.  The state passed laws to try to control white encroachment on the reservation; some stole wood from its forests. A large region, once rich in wood, fish and game, it was considered highly desirable by the whites. With competition between whites and the Wampanoag, conflicts were more frequent than for more isolated Indian settlements elsewhere in the state.\n\n==== Wampanoag on Martha's Vineyard ====\nOn Martha's Vineyard in the 18th and 19th centuries, there were three reservations\u2014[[Chappaquiddick Island|Chappaquiddick]], Christiantown and [[Gay Head]]. The Chappaquiddick Reservation was part of a small island of the same name and was located on the eastern point of that island. As the result of the sale of land in 1789, the Indians lost valuable areas, and the remaining land was distributed among the Indian residents in 1810. In 1823 the laws were changed, in order to hinder those trying to get rid of the Indians and to implement a visible beginning of a civic organization. Around 1849, they owned {{convert|692|acre|km2}} of infertile land, and many of the residents moved to nearby [[Edgartown, Massachusetts|Edgartown]], so that they could practice a trade and obtain some civil rights.<ref name=\"HNAIff\">''Handbook of North American Indians.''

In 1849 the reservation still consisted of {{convert|390|acre|km2}}, of which all but 10 were distributed among the residents. The land, kept under community ownership, yielded very few crops and the tribe members left it to get paying jobs in the cities. Wampanoag [[oral history]] tells that Christiantown was wiped out in 1888 by a [[smallpox]] epidemic.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\nThe third reservation on Martha's Vineyard was constructed in 1711 by the [[New England Company]] (founded in 1649) to Christianize the Indians. They bought land for the Gay Head Indians who had lived there since before 1642. There was considerable dispute about how the land should be cultivated, as the colony had leased the better sections to the whites at low interest. The original goal of creating an undisturbed center for missionary work was quickly forgotten. The state finally created a reservation on a peninsula on the western point of Martha's Vineyard and named it Gay Head. This region was connected to the main island by an isthmus; it enabled the isolation desired by the Wampanoag. In 1849 they had {{convert|2400|acre|km2}} there, of which 500 acres were distributed among the tribe members. The rest was communal property. In contrast to the other reservation groups, the tribe had no guardian or headman. When they needed advice on legal questions, they asked the guardian of the Chappaquiddick Reservation, but other matters they handled themselves. The band used [[usufruct]] title, meaning that members had no legal claim to their land and allowed the tribal members free rein over their choice of land, as well as over cultivation and building, in order to make their ownership clear. They did not allow whites to settle on their land.  They made strict laws regulating membership in the tribe. As a result, they were able to strengthen the groups' ties to each other, and they did not lose their tribal identity until long after other groups had lost theirs.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\nThe Wampanoag on [[Nantucket Island]] were almost completely destroyed by an unknown [[plague (disease)|plague]] in 1763; the last Nantucket Wampanoag died in 1855.<ref name=\"HNAIff\" />\n\n==Current status==\n[[File:Plimoth Plantation Native American Wigwam.jpg|thumb|right|Wampanoag educator at [[Plimoth Plantation]]]]\nSlightly more than 2,000 Wampanoag are counted as enrolled members of the nation today (many have ancestry including other tribes and races), and many live near the [[Indian reservation|reservation]] (Watuppa Wampanoag Reservation) on Martha's Vineyard, in [[Dukes County, Massachusetts|Dukes County]]. It is located in the town of [[Aquinnah, Massachusetts|Aquinnah]] (formerly known as Gay Head), at the extreme western part of the island. It has a land area of {{convert|1.952|km2|acre}}, and a [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]] resident population of 91 persons.\n\nSeveral bands of the Wampanoag have organized governments: Aquinnah of Gay Head, Assonet, Herring Pond, Mashpee, Pocasset, Pokonoket and Seekonk. Only the Aquinnah and Mashpee bands have gained federal recognition, although the other bands are recognized by the state of Massachusetts and have also applied for federal recognition as tribes.\n\nSome genealogy experts testified that the tribes did not demonstrate the required continuity since historic times.  For instance, in his testimony to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the historian Francis Hutchins said that the Mashpee \"were not an Indian tribe in the years 1666, 1680, 1763, 1790, 1834, 1870, and 1970, or at any time between 1666 and 1970 (Day 36, 130\u2013140). In his opinion, an Indian tribe was \"an entity composed of persons of American Indian descent, which entity possesses distinct political, legal, cultural attributes, which attributes have descended directly from aboriginal precursors.\" (Day 36, 124). Without accounting for cultural change, adaptation, and the effects of non-Indian society, Hutchins argued the Mashpee were not an Indian tribe historically because they adopted Christianity and non-Indian forms of dress and appearance, and chose to remain in Massachusetts as \"second-class\" citizens rather than emigrating westward (note: to Indian Territory) to \"resume tribal existence.\" Hutchins also noted that they intermarried with non-Indians to create a \"non-white,\" or \"colored,\" community (Day 36, 130\u2013140). Hutchins appeared to require unchanged culture, including maintenance of a traditional religion and essentially total social autonomy from non-Indian society.\"<ref>[http://mashpeewampanoagtribe.com/mashpee_final_determination.pdf \"Testimony of Historian Francis Hutchins\"], ''Mashpee Wampanoag Final Determination,'' 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Wampanoag federally recognized tribes ===\n\n==== Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head (Aquinnah) ====\n{{Main|Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head}}\n[[File:WampanoagWhaler.jpg|thumb|right|Amos Hoskins, an Aquinnah Wampanoag Whaling Captain]]\nThe Aquinnah (''\"land under the hill\"''<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&p_theme=bg&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EADDCA7494773F9&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM ''Boston Globe'', May 15, 1997]</ref><ref>[http://www.cradleboard.org/cnat/profiles/wanpanoag.htm \"Wampanoag\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200624/http://www.cradleboard.org/cnat/profiles/wanpanoag.htm |date=October 29, 2013 }} ''[[Cradleboard Teaching Project]]''.

He belonged to the Shrivatsa ''gotram'' and Apastambha ''sutram'' of the [[Niyogi Brahmin]] caste. His father was Errapragada Suranna and mother was Errapragada Potamma.  His grandfather was Errapragada Errapotanna whose name was given to him and his grandmother was Errapragada Peramma.  His great-grandparents were Errapragada Bolanna and Errapragada Polamma and his great-great-grandfather was Errapragada Bhimanna.  His family followed the Aradhya sect of [[Hinduism|Sanatana Dharma]]. Although Erranna was a devotee of [[Shiva]], he also worshipped Lord [[Vishnu]].\n\n==Contributions==\nThe [[Sanskrit]] [[Mahabharata]] was translated into [[Telugu language|Telugu]] over a period of several centuries (from the 11th to 14th centuries CE). Erranna was one of the ''[[kavitrayam]]'' (\"Trinity of Poets\") who rendered the [[Mahabharatam]] from Sanskrit into Telugu. The other two poets were [[Nannaya]] and [[Tikkana]] of the ''[[Andhra Mahabharatam]]'' (\"Andhra Mahabharat\"). Tikkana translated the remaining books starting from the 4th, leaving the third book titled the ''Aranya Parvamu'' (\"Book of the Forest\") half-finished, for Erranna to complete. [[Tikkana]] did not touch this part because it was considered to be inauspicious to translate this book, which was left half-finished by [[Nannaya]]. Erranna started the remaining half of the ''Aranya Parvamu'' with the style of Nannaya and ended it with the style of Tikkana as a bridge between the parts translated by Nannaya and Tikkana. Just like Nannaya and Tikkanna, he used half [[Sanskrit]] and half [[Telugu language|Telugu]] in his Telugu translation of the Sanskrit Mahabharat. He translated the ''Harivamsamu'' and ''Ramayanamu'' from Sanskrit, dedicating both works to the founder of the Reddy Dynasty, King Prolaya Vemareddy.\n\n''Nrisimhapuranamu'' was his own independent work. Erranna received his inspiration for the Nrisimhapuranam from his grandfather Errapotanna. According to tradition, one day when Erranna was meditating, his grandfather appeared and advised him to write the ''Narisimhapuranamu''. This work was based on the ''Brahmandapuranamu'' and the ''Vishnupuranamu''.\n\nAccording to the ''Vishnupuranamu'', King Hiranyakasyapa was the powerful sovereign of [[Bharatavarsha]] (the mythological country that encompassed the entire [[Indian subcontinent]]) and was a contemporary of King [[Indra]], the sovereign of Ilavritavarsha, also known as [[Swarga]], which was located in the North of India. The subjects of Bharatavarsha were described as ''Manavas'' (\"descendants of Manu\"; \"humans\"). The subjects of King Indra were described as ''Devatas''. King Hiranyakasyapa fought a war with King [[Indra]] and, having emerged victorious, occupied Ilavritavarsha. Under the rule of King Hiranyakasyapa, most of the Devatas either \"converted to\" or disguised themselves as Manavas for the fear of King Hiranyakasyapa. Another contemporary of King Hiranyakasyapa was the gate keeper of Vishnu in previous life, who ruled the land beyond Ilavritavarsha in the ''[[Kshir Sagar|Kshira Sagaram]]'' (the \"Sea of Milk\").\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Reddy dynasty]]\n* [[Telugu literature]]\n* [[Kavitrayam]]\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Telugu poets]]\n[[Category:Translators from Sanskrit]]\n[[Category:Telugu writers]]\n[[Category:People from Prakasam district]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]\n[[Category:Year of death unknown]]\n[[Category:Poets from Andhra Pradesh]]\n[[Category:14th-century Indian poets]]\n[[Category:14th-century Indian translators]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=October 2019}}\n{{Hatnote|This is a [[Telugu language|Telugu name]]; the family name is ''Errapragada or Yerrapragada''.}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2010}}\n'''Errapragada Erranna'''  was a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] poet in the court of King Prolaya Vema Reddy (1325\u20131353).

It was envisioned by [[Satish Ranjan Das]], a [[Kolkata]] lawyer, who prevised a school modelled on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], but conscious of Indian ambitions and desires. Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was an Englishman, [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E. Foot]], who had spent nine years as a science master at [[Eton College]], England.<ref>{{cite book|year=1979|chapter=FOOT, Arthur Edward|title=Who Was Who 1961\u20131970|location=London|publisher=A. & C.

He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nDoon houses roughly 500 pupils aged 13 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can opt for either [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

It uses several blades with a spanwise axis parallel to the axis of rotation and perpendicular to the direction of fluid motion. These blades are cyclically [[Blade pitch|pitched]] twice per revolution to produce force ([[thrust]] or [[Lift (force)|lift]]) in any direction normal to the axis of rotation. Cyclorotors are used for propulsion, lift, and control on air and water vehicles. An aircraft using cyclorotors as the primary source of lift, propulsion, and control is known as a [[cyclogyro]].

The joint action of the advancement produced by the orbital motion and pitch angle variation generates a higher thrust at low speed than any other propeller. In hover, the blades are actuated to a positive [[blade pitch|pitch]] (outward from the centre of the rotor) on the upper half of their revolution and a negative pitch (inward towards the axis of rotation) over the lower half inducing a net upward aerodynamic force and opposite fluid [[downwash]]. By varying the phase of this pitch motion the force can be shifted to any perpendicular angle or even downward. Before blade [[aerodynamic stall|stall]], increasing the amplitude of the pitching kinematics will magnify thrust.\n\n==History==\n{{Expand section |date=March 2016}}\nThe origin of the rotocycloid propeller are Russian and relates to the aeronautic domain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rotoplan.narod.ru/history_e.htm |title=History of the Rotoplan |date=8 June 2013 |website=Rotoplan}}</ref> Sverchkov's \"Samoljot\" (St. Petersburg, 1909) or \"wheel orthopter\" was the first vehicle expressly thought to have used this type of propulsion. Its scheme came near to cyclogiro, but it's difficult to classify it precisely. It had three flat surfaces and a rudder; the rear edge of one of surfaces could be bent, replacing the action of an elevator. Lift and thrust had to be created by paddle wheels consisting of 12 blades, established in pairs under a 120\u00b0 angle. The blades of a concave shape were changing an angle of incidence by the means of eccentrics and springs. In a bottom of the craft 10&nbsp;hp engine was arranged. Transmission was ensured by a belt. Empty weight was about 200&nbsp;kg. \"Samoljot\" was constructed by the military engineer E.P. Sverchkov with the grants of the Main Engineering Agency in St. Petersburg in 1909, was demonstrated at the Newest Inventions Exhibition and won a medal. Otherwise, it could not pass the preliminary tests without flying.\n\nIn 1914, Russian inventor and scientist [[Alexander Lodygin|A.N. Lodygin]] addressed the Russian government with the project of the cyclogiro-like aircraft, his scheme was similar to Sverchkov's \"Samoljot\". The project was not carried out. \n\nIn 1933, experiments in Germany by [[Adolf Rohrbach]] resulted in a paddle-wheel wing arrangement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://discaircraft.greyfalcon.us/Rohrbach%20Cyclogyro.htm |title=Rohrbach Cyclogyro (1933) |first=Rob |last=Arndt |website=Disc Aircraft of the Third Reich (1922-1945 and Beyond)}}</ref> Oscillating winglets went from positive to negative angles of attack during each revolution to create lift, and their eccentric mounting would, in theory, produce nearly any combination of horizontal and vertical forces. The DVL evaluated Rohrbach's design, but the foreign aviation journals of the time cast doubt on the soundness of the design which meant that funding for the project could not be raised, even with a latter proposal as a Luftwaffe transport aircraft. There appears to be no evidence that this design was ever built, let alone flown. Based on Rohrbach's paddle-wheel research, however, Platt in the US designed by 1933 his own independent Cyclogyro. His paddle-wheel wing arrangement was awarded a US patent (which was only one of many similar patents on file), and underwent extensive wind-tunnel testing at MIT in 1927. Despite this, there is no evidence Platt's aircraft was ever built.\n\nThe first operative cycloid propulsion was developed at [[Voith]]. Its origins date to the decision of the Voith company to focus on the business of transmission gear assemblies for turbines. The famous Voight propeller was based on its fluid-dynamics know-how gained from previous turbine projects. It was invented by Ernst Schneider, and enhanced by Voith. It was launched with name of [[Voith-Schneider]] Propeller (VSP) for commercial vessels. This new marine drive could significantly improve the manoeuvrability of a ship as demonstrated in the successful sea trials on the test boat Torqueo, in 1937. The first Voith Schneider Propellers were put into operation in the narrow canals of Venice, Italy. During the 1937 World Fair in Paris, Voith was awarded the grand prize \u2013 three times \u2013 for its exhibition of Voith Schneider Propellers and Voith turbo-transmissions. A year later, two of Paris' fire-fighting boats started operating with the new VSP system.\n\n==Design advantages and challenges==\n\n===Rapid thrust vectoring===\nCyclorotors provide a high degree of control. Traditional [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propellers]], [[helicopter rotor|rotors]], and [[jet engine]]s produce thrust only along their axis of rotation and require rotation of the entire device to alter the thrust direction. This rotation requires large forces and comparatively long time scales since the propeller inertia is considerable, and the rotor [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic forces]] resist rotation. For many practical applications (helicopters, airplanes, ships) this requires rotating the entire vessel. In contrast, cyclorotors need only to vary the blade pitch motions. Since there is little inertia associated with blade pitch change, thrust vectoring in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation is rapid.<ref name=\"49thAIAA\">{{cite journal |last1=Jarugumilli |first1=Tejaswi |last2=Benedict |first2=Moble |last3=Chopra |first3=Inderjit |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Experimental Optimization and Performance Analysis of a MAV Scale Cycloidal Rotor |date=4 January 2011 |journal=49th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting |doi=10.2514/6.2011-821|isbn=978-1-60086-950-1 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:CyclorotorThrustVectoring.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|center|Cyclorotors can quickly vector thrust by altering the pattern of blade pitching]]\n\n===High advance ratio thrust and symmetric lift===\nCyclorotors can produce lift and thrust at high advance ratios, which, in theory, would enable a cyclogyro aircraft to fly at subsonic speeds well exceeding those of single rotor helicopters.

This value cannot exceed the speed of sound if the rotor is to be efficient and quiet. Slowing the rotor rotational speed avoids this problem, but presents another. In the traditional method of the composition of velocity it is easy to understand that the velocity experienced by the retreating blade has a value that is produced by the vector composition of the velocity of blade rotation and the freestream velocity. In this condition it is evident that in presence of a sufficiently high [[advance ratio]] the velocity of air on the retreating blade is low. The flapping movement of the blade changes the angle of attack. It is then possible for the blade to reach the stall condition.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.enu.kz/repository/2010/AIAA-2010-2888.pdf |title=Aeroelastic analysis of a micro-air-vehicle-scale cycloidal rotor in hover |last1=Benedict |first1=Moble |last2=Mattaboni |first2=Mattia |last3=Chopra |first3=Inderjit |last4=Masarati |first4=Pierangelo |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=AIAA Journal |date=November 2011 |volume=49 |number=11 |pages=2430\u20132443 |doi=10.2514/1.J050756 |access-date=17 March 2019|bibcode=2011AIAAJ..49.2430B }}</ref> In this case it is necessary that the stalling blade increases the pitch angle to keep some lift capability.

It is evident that the wing-blades of a cyclorotor operates in different way than a traditional aircraft wing or a traditional helicopter wing. The blades of a cyclorotor oscillates by rotation around a point that rotating describes an ideal circumference. The combination of the advancement motion of the centre of rotation of the blade and the oscillation of the blade (it is a movement somehow similar to the pendulum), which continue to vary its pitch generate a complex set of aerodynamic phenomena: \n# the delay of the blade stall; \n# an increase of the maximum blade lift coefficient at low [[Reynolds number]]s. \nThe two effects are evidently correlated with a general increase of the thrust produced. \nIf compared to a helicopter or any other propeller, it is evident that the same blade section in a rotocycloid produces much more thrust at the same Reynolds number. This effect can be explained by considering the traditional behavior of a propeller.\n\nAt low Reynolds numbers [[Turbulence#Turbulence and Reynolds number|turbulence]] and laminar flow conditions can ever been reached. Considering a traditional wing profile it is evident that those conditions minimizes the speed differences between upper and lower face of the wing. It is then evident that both lift and stall speed are reduced. A consequence is a reduction of angle of attach at which stall conditions are reached. \n\nIn this regime, conventional propellers and rotors must use larger blade area and rotate faster to achieve the same propulsive forces and lose more energy to blade drag. It is then evident that a cyclorotor is much more energy efficient than any other propeller. \n\nActual cyclorotors bypass this problem by quickly increasing and then decreasing blade angle of attack, which temporarily delays stall and achieves a high lift coefficient. This [[unsteady lift]] makes cyclorotors more efficient at small scales, low velocities, and high altitudes than traditional propellers. \nIt is otherwise evident that many living beings are still much more efficient, because they can change not only the pitch but also the shape of their wings, such as birds,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Correlates of wing morphology with foraging behaviour and migration distance in the genus Phylloscopus |last1=Marchetti |first1=Karen |last2=Price |first2=Trevor |last3=Richman |first3=Adam |lastauthoramp=yes |date=September 1995 |journal=[[Journal of Avian Biology]] |volume=26 |number=3 |pages=177\u2013181 |doi=10.2307/3677316|jstor=3677316 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Do migrant birds have more pointed wings?: a comparative study |first=Mikko |last=Monkkonen |date=September 1995 |journal=[[Evolutionary Ecology (journal)|Evolutionary Ecology]] |volume=9 |number=5 |pages=520\u2013528 |doi=10.1007/BF01237833}}</ref> and some insects or they can change the property of the boundary layer such as [[sharkskin]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/785.full |title=The hydrodynamic function of shark skin and two biomimetic applications |first1=Johannes |last1=Oeffner |first2=George V. |last2=Lauder |date=2012 |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=215 |number=5 |pages=785\u2013795 |doi=10.1242/jeb.063040 |access-date=17 March 2019 |pmid=22323201}}</ref>\n\nSome research tries to acquire the same level of efficiency of the natural examples of wings or surfaces.<ref>{{cite book |title=Flow Phenomena in Nature: Inspiration, learning and application |editor-first=R.

The relative flow angle experienced by the blades as they rotate about the rotor varies substantially with advance ratio and rotor thrust. To operate most efficiently a blade pitch mechanism should adjust for these diverse flow angles. High rotational velocities makes it difficult to implement an actuator based mechanism, which calls for a fixed or variable shape track for pitch control, mounted parallel to blade trajectory, onto which are placed blade's followers such as rollers or airpads - the pitch control track shape reliably determines blade's pitch along the orbit regardless of the blade's RPM. While the pitching motions used in hover are not optimized for forward flight, in experimental evaluation they were found to provide efficient flight up to an advance ratio near one.<ref name=\"zadams_mb\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Robert |title=VTOL to Transonic Aircraft |journal=SBIR A02.07: Final Technical Report |date=24 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Benedict |first1=Moble |last2=Jarugumilli |first2=Tejaswi |last3=Lakshminarayan |first3=Vinod |last4=Chopra |first4=Inderjit |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Experimental and Computational Studies to Understand the Role of Flow Curvature Effects on the Aerodynamic Performance of a MAV-Scale Cycloidal Rotor in Forward Flight |date=April 2012 |journal=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |doi=10.2514/6.2012-1629|isbn=978-1-60086-937-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jarugumilli |first1=Tejaswi |title=Experimental Investigation of the Forward Flight Performance of a MAV-Scale Cycloidal Rotor |journal=American Helicopter Society |date=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Wind turbines===\n[[Wind turbine]]s are a potential application of cyclorotors.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Three pitch control systems for vertical axis wind turbines compared |first1=Leo  |last1=Lazauskas |date=January 1992 |journal=Wind Engineering |volume=16 |number=5 |pages=269\u2013282 |doi= }}</ref> They are named in this case [[Variable_speed_wind_turbine|variable-pitch vertical axis wind turbines]], with large benefits with respect to traditional VAWTs.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Pawsey |first=N.

The joint action of the advancement produced by the orbital motion and pitch angle variation generates a higher thrust at low speed than any other propeller. In hover, the blades are actuated to a positive [[blade pitch|pitch]] (outward from the centre of the rotor) on the upper half of their revolution and a negative pitch (inward towards the axis of rotation) over the lower half inducing a net upward aerodynamic force and opposite fluid [[downwash]].

Its scheme came near to cyclogiro, but it's difficult to classify it precisely. It had three flat surfaces and a rudder; the rear edge of one of surfaces could be bent, replacing the action of an elevator. Lift and thrust had to be created by paddle wheels consisting of 12 blades, established in pairs under a 120\u00b0 angle. The blades of a concave shape were changing an angle of incidence by the means of eccentrics and springs. In a bottom of the craft 10&nbsp;hp engine was arranged. Transmission was ensured by a belt. Empty weight was about 200&nbsp;kg. \"Samoljot\" was constructed by the military engineer E.P. Sverchkov with the grants of the Main Engineering Agency in St. Petersburg in 1909, was demonstrated at the Newest Inventions Exhibition and won a medal. Otherwise, it could not pass the preliminary tests without flying.\n\nIn 1914, Russian inventor and scientist [[Alexander Lodygin|A.N. Lodygin]] addressed the Russian government with the project of the cyclogiro-like aircraft, his scheme was similar to Sverchkov's \"Samoljot\". The project was not carried out. \n\nIn 1933, experiments in Germany by [[Adolf Rohrbach]] resulted in a paddle-wheel wing arrangement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://discaircraft.greyfalcon.us/Rohrbach%20Cyclogyro.htm |title=Rohrbach Cyclogyro (1933) |first=Rob |last=Arndt |website=Disc Aircraft of the Third Reich (1922-1945 and Beyond)}}</ref> Oscillating winglets went from positive to negative angles of attack during each revolution to create lift, and their eccentric mounting would, in theory, produce nearly any combination of horizontal and vertical forces. The DVL evaluated Rohrbach\u2019s design, but the foreign aviation journals of the time cast doubt on the soundness of the design which meant that funding for the project could not be raised, even with a latter proposal as a Luftwaffe transport aircraft. There appears to be no evidence that this design was ever built, let alone flown. Based on Rohrbach\u2019s paddle-wheel research, however, Platt in the US designed by 1933 his own independent Cyclogyro. His paddle-wheel wing arrangement was awarded a US patent (which was only one of many similar patents on file), and underwent extensive wind-tunnel testing at MIT in 1927. Despite this, there is no evidence Platt\u2019s aircraft was ever built.\n\nThe first operative cycloid propulsion was developed at [[Voith]]. Its origins date to the decision of the Voith company to focus on the business of transmission gear assemblies for turbines. The famous Voight propeller was based on its fluid-dynamics know-how gained from previous turbine projects. It was invented by Ernst Schneider, and enhanced by Voith. It was launched with name of [[Voith-Schneider]] Propeller (VSP) for commercial vessels. This new marine drive could significantly improve the manoeuvrability of a ship as demonstrated in the successful sea trials on the test boat Torqueo, in 1937. The first Voith Schneider Propellers were put into operation in the narrow canals of Venice, Italy. During the 1937 World Fair in Paris, Voith was awarded the grand prize \u2013 three times \u2013 for its exhibition of Voith Schneider Propellers and Voith turbo-transmissions. A year later, two of Paris' fire-fighting boats started operating with the new VSP system.\n\n==Design advantages and challenges==\n\n===Rapid thrust vectoring===\nCyclorotors provide a high degree of control. Traditional [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propellers]], [[helicopter rotor|rotors]], and [[jet engine]]s produce thrust only along their axis of rotation and require rotation of the entire device to alter the thrust direction. This rotation requires large forces and comparatively long time scales since the propeller inertia is considerable, and the rotor [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic forces]] resist rotation. For many practical applications (helicopters, airplanes, ships) this requires rotating the entire vessel. In contrast, cyclorotors need only to vary the blade pitch motions. Since there is little inertia associated with blade pitch change, thrust vectoring in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation is rapid.<ref name=\"49thAIAA\">{{cite journal |last1=Jarugumilli |first1=Tejaswi |last2=Benedict |first2=Moble |last3=Chopra |first3=Inderjit |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Experimental Optimization and Performance Analysis of a MAV Scale Cycloidal Rotor |date=4 January 2011 |journal=49th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting |doi=10.2514/6.2011-821|isbn=978-1-60086-950-1 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:CyclorotorThrustVectoring.svg|thumb|upright=2.25|center|Cyclorotors can quickly vector thrust by altering the pattern of blade pitching]]\n\n===High advance ratio thrust and symmetric lift===\nCyclorotors can produce lift and thrust at high advance ratios, which, in theory, would enable a cyclogyro aircraft to fly at subsonic speeds well exceeding those of single rotor helicopters.

This value cannot exceed the speed of sound if the rotor is to be efficient and quiet. Slowing the rotor rotational speed avoids this problem, but presents another. In the traditional method of the composition of velocity it is easy to understand that the velocity experienced by the retreating blade has a value that is produced by the vector composition of the velocity of blade rotation and the freestream velocity. In this condition it is evident that in presence of a sufficiently high [[advance ratio]] the velocity of air on the retreating blade is low. The flapping movement of the blade changes the angle of attack. It is then possible for the blade to reach the stall condition.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.enu.kz/repository/2010/AIAA-2010-2888.pdf |title=Aeroelastic analysis of a micro-air-vehicle-scale cycloidal rotor in hover |last1=Benedict |first1=Moble |last2=Mattaboni |first2=Mattia |last3=Chopra |first3=Inderjit |last4=Masarati |first4=Pierangelo |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=AIAA Journal |date=November 2011 |volume=49 |number=11 |pages=2430\u20132443 |doi=10.2514/1.J050756 |access-date=17 March 2019|bibcode=2011AIAAJ..49.2430B }}</ref> In this case it is necessary that the stalling blade increases the pitch angle to keep some lift capability.

It is evident that the wing-blades of a cyclorotor operates in different way than a traditional aircraft wing or a traditional helicopter wing. The blades of a cyclorotor oscillates by rotation around a point that rotating describes an ideal circumference. The combination of the advancement motion of the centre of rotation of the blade and the oscillation of the blade (it is a movement somehow similar to the pendulum), which continue to vary its pitch generate a complex set of aerodynamic phenomena: \n# the delay of the blade stall; \n# an increase of the maximum blade lift coefficient at low [[Reynolds number]]s. \nThe two effects are evidently correlated with a general increase of the thrust produced. \nIf compared to a helicopter or any other propeller, it is evident that the same blade section in a rotocycloid produces much more thrust at the same Reynolds number. This effect can be explained by considering the traditional behavior of a propeller.\n\nAt low Reynolds numbers [[Turbulence#Turbulence and Reynolds number|turbulence]] and laminar flow conditions can ever been reached. Considering a traditional wing profile it is evident that those conditions minimizes the speed differences between upper and lower face of the wing. It is then evident that both lift and stall speed are reduced. A consequence is a reduction of angle of attach at which stall conditions are reached. \n\nIn this regime, conventional propellers and rotors must use larger blade area and rotate faster to achieve the same propulsive forces and lose more energy to blade drag. It is then evident that a cyclorotor is much more energy efficient than any other propeller. \n\nActual cyclorotors bypass this problem by quickly increasing and then decreasing blade angle of attack, which temporarily delays stall and achieves a high lift coefficient. This [[unsteady lift]] makes cyclorotors more efficient at small scales, low velocities, and high altitudes than traditional propellers. \nIt is otherwise evident that many living beings are still much more efficient, because they can change not only the pitch but also the shape of their wings, such as birds,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Correlates of wing morphology with foraging behaviour and migration distance in the genus Phylloscopus |last1=Marchetti |first1=Karen |last2=Price |first2=Trevor |last3=Richman |first3=Adam |lastauthoramp=yes |date=September 1995 |journal=[[Journal of Avian Biology]] |volume=26 |number=3 |pages=177\u2013181 |doi=10.2307/3677316|jstor=3677316 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Do migrant birds have more pointed wings?: a comparative study |first=Mikko |last=Monkkonen |date=September 1995 |journal=[[Evolutionary Ecology (journal)|Evolutionary Ecology]] |volume=9 |number=5 |pages=520\u2013528 |doi=10.1007/BF01237833}}</ref> and some insects or they can change the property of the boundary layer such as [[sharkskin]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/215/5/785.full |title=The hydrodynamic function of shark skin and two biomimetic applications |first1=Johannes |last1=Oeffner |first2=George V. |last2=Lauder |date=2012 |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=215 |number=5 |pages=785\u2013795 |doi=10.1242/jeb.063040 |access-date=17 March 2019 |pmid=22323201}}</ref>\n\nSome research tries to acquire the same level of efficiency of the natural examples of wings or surfaces.<ref>{{cite book |title=Flow Phenomena in Nature: Inspiration, learning and application |editor-first=R.

The relative flow angle experienced by the blades as they rotate about the rotor varies substantially with advance ratio and rotor thrust. To operate most efficiently a blade pitch mechanism should adjust for these diverse flow angles. High rotational velocities makes it difficult to implement an actuator based mechanism, which calls for a fixed or variable shape track for pitch control, mounted parallel to blade trajectory, onto which are placed blade's followers such as rollers or airpads - the pitch control track shape reliably determines blade's pitch along the orbit regardless of the blade's RPM. While the pitching motions used in hover are not optimized for forward flight, in experimental evaluation they were found to provide efficient flight up to an advance ratio near one.<ref name=\"zadams_mb\" /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Robert |title=VTOL to Transonic Aircraft |journal=SBIR A02.07: Final Technical Report |date=24 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Benedict |first1=Moble |last2=Jarugumilli |first2=Tejaswi |last3=Lakshminarayan |first3=Vinod |last4=Chopra |first4=Inderjit |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Experimental and Computational Studies to Understand the Role of Flow Curvature Effects on the Aerodynamic Performance of a MAV-Scale Cycloidal Rotor in Forward Flight |date=April 2012 |journal=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |doi=10.2514/6.2012-1629|isbn=978-1-60086-937-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jarugumilli |first1=Tejaswi |title=Experimental Investigation of the Forward Flight Performance of a MAV-Scale Cycloidal Rotor |journal=American Helicopter Society |date=2012}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Wind turbines===\n[[Wind turbine]]s are a potential application of cyclorotors.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Three pitch control systems for vertical axis wind turbines compared |first1=Leo  |last1=Lazauskas |date=January 1992 |journal=Wind Engineering |volume=16 |number=5 |pages=269\u2013282 |doi= }}</ref> They are named in this case [[Variable_speed_wind_turbine|variable-pitch vertical axis wind turbines]], with large benefits with respect to traditional VAWTs.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Pawsey |first=N.
