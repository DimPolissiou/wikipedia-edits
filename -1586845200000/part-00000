On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would now allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard completed quickly and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery should be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided cease procuring material directly and to mandate a harbour for the overall budget of the project, either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her pieces were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow, <ref name=forrer15 /> and ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767. <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> ''Bretagne'' was commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> but in June 1770 work remained to be done to make her sea worthy, and she spent the whole year fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

He also reminded of the shortcomings of [[French ship Royal Louis (1759)|''Royal Louis'']], an unsuccessful 100-gun of the time.<ref name=binet222>Binet, p.222</ref> \n\nGroignard hoped to complete construction by 1763, but delay in complete the 1-million load and difficulties in stocking construction wood soon set the schedule back. On 28 March 1763, Groignard sent completed plans to the construction commission, which failed to forward them to Choiseul. On 6 May, Choiseul wrote directly to Groignard to enquire, and setting further requirements that the artillery be set on the three batteries (limiting armament of the castles),<ref name=forrer14>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.14</ref> and that autonomy be sufficient to feed 1,000 men for six months, with water for two.<ref name=binet223>Binet, p.223</ref> By July, construction was expected to be completed in 1765,<ref name=binet225>Binet, p.225</ref> and there were several exchanges of letters and budget estimations between various administrations and rival naval engineers, second-guessing Groignard and arguing about the furniture and spare parts needed for the ship.<ref name=binet228>Binet, p.228</ref> \n\n[[File:Three-decker Bretagne-P4130051.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction on ''Bretagne'' flying the white ensign of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]].]]\nBy 3 January 1764, the Commission was requesting revised versions of the plans as to reduce the dimensions of ''Bretagne''.<ref name=binet231>Binet, p.231</ref> On 23, Groignard submitted his new plans, along with a memorandum underlining that this version would now allow the ship to hold six month worth of food and was compromising her stability, speed and man\u0153uverability.<ref name=binet235>Binet, p.235</ref> On 19 February, Choiseul declined to approve the revised plans and requested a third version; Groignard completed quickly and went directly to Paris himself to submit them, short-circuiting the construction Commission of the Estates of Brittany<ref name=binet237>Binet, p.237</ref> and talking Choiseul out of the notion that the lower battery should be armed with 24-pounders instead of 36-pounders.<ref name=binet238>Binet, p.238</ref><ref name=forrer14 /> On 7 May, Choiseul informed the Commission that his plans had met with approval and that the construction could begin.<ref name=binet238 />\n\nThe Commission then started procuring the raw materials needed for the construction, notably wood, fabric for the sails, iron and cables. Lacking experience in the matter, it requested advice from Roth, director of the East India Company in Lorient,<ref name=forrer14 /> who replied on 1 April with a long memorandum.<ref name=binet239>Binet, p.239</ref> Besides explaining how to assess the quality of the materials, how to transport it on land and how to store it, the memorandum observed that a number of parts would need to be obtained from outside of Bretagne, and sometimes even abroard, notably from the Netherlands.<ref name=binet240>Binet, p.240</ref> Providers would span from [[Newcastle]] to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Riga]].<ref name=binet240 />\n\nIn August 1764, Groignard started laying down parts in Lorient shipyard, hoping to take advantage of the summer weather and of a moment of low activity by the East India Company. However, the fluyts needed to transport construction wood were damaged and a lack of wood and nails soon slowed down the work.<ref name=binet242>Binet, p.242</ref> In December, the Estates and the Company signed an understanding that Groignard would have access to the parts and materials stocked in the Company stores, and that the Estates would replenish them within three months.<ref name=binet243>Binet, p.243</ref> On 12 December, the keel was laid down, the bow had been assembled, and the [[Frame (nautical)|frames]] were made and ready to be installed.<ref name=binet244>Binet, p.244</ref>\n\nHowever, on 12 January 1765, the Commission ordered that the construction be halted, <ref name=binet244 /> and summoned Groignard to Nantes.<ref name=binet249>Binet, p.249</ref> Realising its lack of competence, the Commission had decided cease procuring material directly and to mandate a harbour for the overall budget of the project, either Lorient or Brest.<ref name=binet250>Binet, p.252</ref> By March, Brest had won the contract; <ref name=binet254>Binet, p.254</ref> the ship was dismantled and her pieces were brought to Brest in May 1765.<ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /> Groignard remained in charge of the work, <ref name=binet254 /> while the Commission was little involved from then on.<ref name=binet255>Binet, p.255</ref> \n\nOn 5 July 1765, the keel was laid down in Brest<ref name=binet256>Binet, p.256</ref> in the upper dry dock of Pontaniou.<ref name=forrer15>Forrer, ''Neptunia'' 202, p.15</ref> By mid-July, the framing was completed.<ref name=binet256 /> By mid-September, the hull was [[Caulk|caulked]].<ref name=binet257>Binet, p.257</ref> In late February 1766, carpenters had completed the [[orlop deck]] and were preparing construction of the [[Gun deck|first battery]].<ref name=binet257 /> In April, the sides were completed up to the lower battery, and the decks of the lower and middle batteries were installed.<ref name=binet258>Binet, p.258</ref> On 24 May 1766, ''Bretagne'' was launched.<ref name=binet258 /><ref name=Roche85 />\n\nCompletion of the ship remained slow, <ref name=forrer15 /> and ''Bretagne'' was declared completed on 30 September 1767. <ref name=demerliac_1774_15 /><ref name=forrer15 /> ''Bretagne'' was commissioned in 1768,<ref name=binet261>Binet, p.261</ref> but in June 1770 work remained to be done to make her sea worthy, and she spent the whole year fitting out.<ref name=forrer15 /> On 30 November 1771, she was declared in need of an extensive refit.<ref name=forrer15 />\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1773, ''Bretagne'' was listed as serving in the Brest Brigade of the Ponant Division of the Navy.<ref name=binet261 /> However, her state was deteriorating, and harbour director Count de Breugnon sent her to a dry dock, where she entered on 9 August.<ref name=forrer15 /> In 1775, [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]], took command of the Brest squadron and, finding her timbers rotten, petitionned [[Antoine de Sartine|Sartine]] for an extensive refit;<ref name=binet261 /><ref name=forrer15 />  reconstruction started on 1 September 1776, taking  480,000 pounds, and ''Bretagne'' was launched on 7 April 1777.

It sought to create a forum for discussing economic inequality at Harvard, in the United States, and throughout the world. It criticized Harvard's influence on global economic policy and its involvement with the American financial sector. It also supported wage campaigns by Harvard workers and a divestment demand initiated by [[Hotel Workers Rising]].\n\nFacing resistance from administration and police, the group established an encampment in [[Harvard Yard]] after a march on November 9, 2011. Immediately after this march, the gates to Harvard Yard were locked and only people with Harvard identity cards were allowed through. Although the encampment gained many faculty supporters, it was not popular among Harvard undergraduates. The security checkpoints were not removed until after the group packed up its tents in December 2011. Occupy Harvard continued to organize into 2012, with a focus on the university's library system.\n\nThe demonstration raised issues of privilege and economic inequality, particularly as they relate to students and administration at one of the world's wealthiest and best-known universities.<ref name=\"Carmichael & Baker 11 Nov\">Mary Carmichael and Billy Baker., \"[http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2011/11/11/harvard_officials_decide_to_keep_harvard_yard_locked_in_wake_of_occupy_tents/ Occupy Harvard left up to students: Harvard officials decide to keep Harvard Yard locked in wake of Occupy tents]\", ''Boston Globe, November 11, 2011.</ref> Supporters described Occupy Harvard as a \"fight for Harvard's soul\", questioning whether the university would \"continue to prioritize money above social justice\".<ref name=\"AsiaOne 16 Nov\"/> Opponents called the demonstrators over-privileged and under-informed attention seekers.<ref name=\"Petri 14 Nov\"/>\n\n==Background==\n[[Harvard University]] is one of the most exclusive universities in the world, with an admission rate of 5.9%.<ref>Blake Ellis, \"[http://money.cnn.com/2012/03/30/pf/college/acceptance_rates_ivy_league/index.htm Harvard, Princeton post record low acceptance rates]\", ''CNN Money'', March 30, 2012.</ref> Harvard is famous for its wealthy graduates but also for its generous financial aid programs.<ref>Timothy Noah, \"[http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_customer/2011/02/the_harvard_effect.html Does Harvard's 'affirmative action for the affluent' screw the proles?]\", ''Slate'', February 3, 2011.</ref> Its [[financial endowment]] of over $30 billion, on which it does not pay taxes, is the largest in the world.<ref>Jodi Upton and Christopher Schnaars, \"[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/education/story/2012-09-09/where-endowment-money-goes/57704440/1 Endowments fund dorms, salaries\u2014and sometimes tuition]\", ''USA Today'', September 9, 2012.</ref> It is one of the world's richest non-profits, competing only with the [[Catholic Church]] (and perhaps the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]]).<ref name=\"Gharavi 13 Nov\">Maryam Monalisa Gharavi, \"[http://blog.lareviewofbooks.org/post/12736839518/crimson-front Crimson Front]\", ''LA Review of Books'', November 13, 2011.</ref>\n\nMany Harvard graduates work in the financial sector based on [[Wall Street]]; many others hold prominent positions in the world of business.

In doing so, we strive to fulfill the promise of this library space as an open and participatory forum for learning. [\u2026]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We think of the proposed Harvard library transition as a manifestation of the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, whether at Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot be imagined in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can only serve to further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We insist on an alternative vision, one that cherishes the human communities and collaborative processes that make intellectual and civic engagement\u2014on campuses and in public parks\u2014not only possible but also fruitful. In Lamont Library, we are creating a community of knowledge sharing that is open, horizontal, and free from the destructive impulses that too often guide our university and that seem to be shaping the library transition.</blockquote>\n<!-- Below is a still image from a creative-commons licensed video!-->\n[[File:No signs in the library.png|thumb|left|Students in Lamont Library are asked to remove a sign they have attached to the wall (still from an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auExcY7_yik Occupy Harvard video])]]\nThe group announced intentions to hold Think Tanks and other meetings in the library from Sunday February 12 through Friday February 17.<ref>Occupy Harvard, \"New Harvard Library Occupation\", cited by Alex R.

It sought to create a forum for discussing economic inequality at Harvard, in the United States, and throughout the world. It criticized Harvard's influence on global economic policy and its involvement with the American financial sector. It also supported wage campaigns by Harvard workers and a divestment demand initiated by [[Hotel Workers Rising]].\n\nFacing resistance from administration and police, the group established an encampment in [[Harvard Yard]] after a march on November 9, 2011. Immediately after this march, the gates to Harvard Yard were locked and only people with Harvard identity cards were allowed through. Although the encampment gained many faculty supporters, it was not popular among Harvard undergraduates. The security checkpoints were not removed until after the group packed up its tents in December 2011.

In doing so, we strive to fulfill the promise of this library space as an open and participatory forum for learning. [\u2026]</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We think of the proposed Harvard library transition as a manifestation of the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, whether at Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot be imagined in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can only serve to further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>We insist on an alternative vision, one that cherishes the human communities and collaborative processes that make intellectual and civic engagement\u2014on campuses and in public parks\u2014not only possible but also fruitful. In Lamont Library, we are creating a community of knowledge sharing that is open, horizontal, and free from the destructive impulses that too often guide our university and that seem to be shaping the library transition.</blockquote>\n<!-- Below is a still image from a creative-commons licensed video!-->\n[[File:No signs in the library.png|thumb|left|Students in Lamont Library are asked to remove a sign they have attached to the wall (still from an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auExcY7_yik Occupy Harvard video])]]\nThe group announced intentions to hold Think Tanks and other meetings in the library from Sunday February 12 through Friday February 17.<ref>Occupy Harvard, \"New Harvard Library Occupation\", cited by Alex R.

His list ends in 1049 with [[Pope Leo IX]] as number 154. Several changes were made to the list during the 20th century. [[Antipope Christopher]] was considered legitimate for a long time. [[Pope-elect Stephen]] was listed under the name ''Stephen II'' until the 1961 edition, when his name was removed. The decisions of the [[Council of Pisa]] (1409) were reversed in 1963 in a reinterpretation of the [[Western Schism]], extending [[Pope Gregory XII]]'s papacy to 1415 and classifying rival claimants [[Antipope Alexander V|Alexander V]] and [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] as antipopes.\n\nA significant number of these popes have been [[List of canonised popes|recognized as saints]], including 48 out of the first 50 consecutive popes, and others are in the sainthood process.

Popes with unique names are not identified by ordinals. Antipopes are treated as [[pretender]]s, and their numbers are reused by true popes. However, there are anomalies in the numbering of the popes. Several numbers were mistakenly increased in the Middle Ages because the records were misunderstood. Several antipopes were also kept in the sequence, either by mistake or because they were previously considered to be true popes.\n\n* Donus: The name has only been used by one pope. The apocryphal [[Pope Donus II]] resulted from confusion between the Latin word ''dominus'' (lord) and the name Donus.\n* Felix: [[Antipope Felix II]] (356\u2013357) was kept in the numbering sequence.<ref name=\"ceanti\">{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Antipope}}</ref>\n* John: The [[Pope John numbering|numbering of the Johns]] is particularly confused. In the modern sequence, the Johns are identified by the numbers they used during their reigns.\n** [[Antipope John XVI]] (997\u2013998) was kept in the numbering sequence.\n** [[Pope John XXI]] (1276\u20131277) chose to skip the number XX, believing that there had been another John between XIV and XV. In reality, John XIV had been counted twice.<ref name=\"cechron\">{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Chronological Lists of Popes}}</ref>\n** By the 16th century, the numbering error had been conflated with legends about a female [[Pope Joan]], whom some authors called John VIII. She was never listed in the ''Annuario Pontificio''.<ref name=\"ceJoan\">{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Popess Joan}}</ref>\n** [[Antipope John XXIII]] (1410\u20131415) was listed in the ''Annuario Pontificio'' as a legitimate pope until the 20th century.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Roman Curia |title=Annuario Pontificio per l'Anno 1942 |date=1942 |location=Rome |page=21 |quote=207.

Due to the similarity between the Latin names ''Marinus'' and ''Martinus'', [[Pope Marinus I|Marinus&nbsp;I]] and [[Pope Marinus II|Marinus&nbsp;II]] were mistakenly considered to be Martin II and III.<ref name=\"cemartin\">{{CathEncy|author=Paschal Robinson|wstitle=Pope Martin IV}}</ref>\n* Stephen: [[Pope-elect Stephen]] (752) died before being consecrated. He was previously known as Stephen II, but the Vatican removed him from the official list of popes in 1961.<ref name=\"cechron\" /> The remaining Stephens are now numbered [[Pope Stephen II]] (752\u2013757) to [[Pope Stephen IX]] (1057\u20131058).\n\nThose who adhere to [[Sedevacantism]] say that there have been no legitimate popes since Pius XII or John XXIII.

In 1876, in the rank of an army captain, he went to [[Serbia]] and took part in the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War]] as an artillery battery commander.\n\nIn 1877\u20141879 Rapp edited ''[[Russkiy Mir (St.-Petersburg newspaper, 1871-1880)|Russkiy Mir]]'', originally a conservative newspaper, which during his years at the helm became more moderate in its approach to the internal affairs. As an essayist Rapp often wrote on the subject of the [[raskolniki]], calling for tolerance towards their beliefs and customs (\"Raskol and Our Legislation\", 1878-1879).

In 1876, in the rank of an army captain, he went to [[Serbia]] and took part in the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War]] as an artillery battery commander.\n\nIn 1877\u20141879 Rapp edited ''[[Russkiy Mir (St.-Petersburg newspaper, 1871-1880)|Russkiy Mir]]'', originally a conservative newspaper, which during his years at the helm became more moderate in its approach to the internal affairs. As an essayist Rapp often wrote on the subject of the [[raskolniki]], calling for tolerance towards their beliefs and customs (\"Raskol and Our Legislation\", 1878-1879). Under Rapp as editor-in-chief, ''Russky Mir'' received three warnings from the officials, the last of which led to a four-month suspension. In 1886 Rapp published the 14-volume literary compilation ''Romanist'' (\u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442, Novelist).
