He was the fourth British headmaster in Doon's history and a member of [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]], [[UK]].\n\nThe school houses roughly 500 pupils aged 12 to 18, and admission is based on a competitive entrance examination, a group discussion and an interview with the headmaster. Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

Subjects on offer include mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, geography, economics, environmental studies, art and design, psychology, music, English, Hindi and Sanskrit. Doon's foreign language offerings include French, German and Spanish. There is a career's department that offers pupils guidance on career paths, college applications, and entrance exams like the [[SAT]]. In recent years, boys have increasingly chosen foreign universities over Indian colleges, sometimes due to the hyper-competitiveness of the [[Higher education in India|Indian higher education system]] that calls for extremely high school-leaving scores for admissions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/education/it-is-an-elite-school-not-elitist/article23029951.ece|title=\u2018It is an elite school, not elitist\u2019|first=Jaideep Deo|last=Bhanj|date=11 March 2018|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref>\n\n===Traditions===\nThe early headmasters and teachers at Doon came from traditional British public schools, and the jargon introduced by them is still in use.

Ordered in 1934, it first flew in 1935 and entered service in 1937. At that point, it was the most advanced aircraft flying for the Navy and possibly for any navy in the world. However, the fast pace of aircraft development quickly caught up with it, and by the time of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] the TBD was already outdated.\n\nThe Douglass built Devastator performed well in some early battles. However, it earned notoriety for its catastrophically poor performance in the [[Battle of Midway]]. During the battle, of the 41 Devastators launched during the battle, there were no torpedo hits only only six survived to return to their carriers. Vastly outclassed in both speed and maneuverability by the [[Mitsubishi Zero]] fighters they faced, most of the force was wiped out with little consequence except to distract the Zeros from the much more capable (and survivable) [[SBD Dauntless]] [[dive bombers]] that eventually sank four Japanese carriers and a heavy cruiser. Although a sizeable portion of the Devastator's dismal performance was later attributed to the many well-documented defects in the US [[Mark 13 torpedo]], the aircraft was immediately withdrawn from frontline service after Midway, being replaced by the [[Grumman TBF Avenger]].\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Douglas XTBD-1 in flight 1935.jpeg|thumb|The XTBD-1 with the original flat canopy in 1935]]\n[[File:TBD-1 in flight Anacostia 1937.jpg|thumb|The first production TBD-1 in 1937]]\n[[File:TBD-1A floatplane in flight 1941.jpg|thumb|A single TBD-1A was tried as a floatplane]]\n\nOrdered on 30 June 1934, and entered into a US Navy competition for new bomber aircraft to operate from its aircraft carriers, the Douglas entry was one of the winners of the competition.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 28.</ref> Other aircraft ordered for production as a result of the competition included the [[Brewster SBA]], the [[Vought SB2U Vindicator]], and the [[Northrop BT-1]] which would evolve into the [[SBD Dauntless]].<ref name=\"Doll p. 4\"/>{{#tag:ref| The [[Great Lakes XB2G]], [[Great Lakes XTBG]], [[Grumman XSBF]], [[Hall XPTBH]] and [[Vought XSB3U]] were also tendered to the specification but were not developed beyond prototype status.<ref name=\"Doll p. 4\">Doll 1992, p. 4.</ref> |group=N}}\n\nThe XTBD Devastator, which flew for the first time on 15 April 1935, marked a large number of \"firsts\" for the US Navy.<ref>Gunston 1976, p. 66.</ref> It was the first widely used carrier-based [[monoplane]] as well as the first all-metal naval aircraft, the first with a totally enclosed cockpit, the first with power-actuated (hydraulically) folding wings and in these respects the TBD was revolutionary.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 78\"/> A semi-retractable landing gear was fitted, with the wheels designed to protrude {{convert|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} below the wings to permit a \"[[belly landing|wheels-up]]\" landing which might limit damage to the aircraft. A crew of three was normally carried beneath a large \"greenhouse\" canopy almost half the length of the aircraft. The pilot sat in front; a rear gunner/radio operator took the rearmost position, while the bombardier occupied the middle seat. During a bombing run, the bombardier lay prone, sliding into position under the pilot to sight through a window in the bottom of the fuselage, using the [[Norden Bombsight]].<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\"/>\n\nThe normal TBD offensive armament consisted of either a {{convert|1935|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Bliss-Leavitt [[Mark 13 torpedo|Mark 13]] [[aerial torpedo]] or a {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bomb, to be carried semi-recessed into a fuselage bomb bay. Alternatively, three {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} general-purpose bombs (one under each wing root and one inside the bomb bay), or twelve {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}} fragmentation bombs (six under each wing root), could be carried. This weapons load was often used when attacking Japanese targets on the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert]] and [[Marshall Islands]] in 1942.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\">Winchester 2004, p. 79.</ref> Defensive armament consisted of a {{convert|.30|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine gun]] for the rear gunner. Fitted in the starboard side of the cowling was either a {{convert|.30|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} or {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[M2 Browning machine gun]].<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\"/>\n\nThe powerplant was a [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|Pratt & Whitney R-1830-64]] Twin Wasp [[radial engine]] of {{convert|850|hp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}}, an outgrowth of the prototype's [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|Pratt & Whitney XR-1830-60/R-1830-1]] of {{convert|800|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Mondey 2006, p. 128\">Mondey 2006, p. 128.</ref> Other changes from the 1935 prototype included a revised engine cowling<ref>Taylor 1969, p. 485.</ref> and raising the cockpit canopy to improve visibility.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 78\"/>\n\nThe XTBD had a flat canopy that was replaced on production models by a higher, domed canopy over a rollover bar. Other than requests by test pilots to improve pilot visibility, the prototype easily passed its acceptance trials that took place from 24 April-24 November 1935 at NAS (Naval Air Station) Anacostia and Norfolk bases. After successfully completing torpedo drop tests, the prototype was transferred to the [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] for carrier certification.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 29.</ref> The extended service trials continued until 1937 with the first two production aircraft retained by the company exclusively for testing.<ref>Tillman 1973, p. 25.</ref>\n\nA total of 129 of the type were purchased by the US Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer), and starting from 1937, began to equip the carriers USS {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, {{USS| Lexington|CV-2|2}}, {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}}, {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} and {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|2}}. In prewar use, TBD units were engaged in training and other operational activities and were gradually approaching the end of their useful service life with at least one aircraft being converted to target tug duty.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 32.</ref> By 1940, the US Navy was aware that the TBD had become outclassed by the fighters and bombers of other nations and a replacement {{#tag:ref|the TBF Avenger|group=N}} was in the works, but it was not yet in service when the US entered [[World War II]]. By then, attrition had reduced their numbers to just over 100 aircraft.<ref>Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 56.</ref> The US Navy assigned popular names to its aircraft in late 1941, and the TBD became the '''Devastator''', although its nickname \"torpecker\" was commonly used.<ref>Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 57.</ref>\n\nThe TBD is prominently featured in the 1941 film [[Dive Bomber (film)|''Dive Bomber'']].\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:TBD VT-6 over Wake Island 1942.jpg|thumb|A VT-6 TBD after attacking [[Wake Island]], 24 February 1942]]\n[[File:Yorktown TBD Huon Gulf March 1942.jpg|thumb|TBDs from VT-5 over the Huon Gulf, 10 March 1942]]\n[[File:TBD VT-3 Midway.jpg|thumb|A TBD-1 from VT-3 en route to the Japanese fleet at Midway]]\n[[File:Vt8tbd-t16-4june1942 waldron.jpg|thumb|right|VT-8's \"T-16\" (BuNo 1506, LCDR [[John C.

The twin .30 caliber machine guns in the rear was unique to VT-8.<ref name=\"Tillman p. 96\">Tillman 2000, p. 96.</ref>]]\n\nIn the early days of the Pacific war, the TBD acquitted itself well during February and March 1942, with TBDs from ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' attacking targets in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, [[Wake Island|Wake]] and [[Marcus Island]]s, while TBDs from ''Yorktown'' and ''Lexington'' struck Japanese shipping off [[New Guinea]] on 10 March.<ref name=\"AI Mar90 p155\">''Air International'' March 1990, p. 155.</ref> In the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] Devastators helped sink the Japanese aircraft carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dh\u014d||2}} on 7 May, but failed to hit another carrier, the {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}}, the next day.<ref name=\"prof p7-8\">Doll 1967, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nFaults were discovered with the [[Mark 13 torpedo]] at this point. Many were seen to hit the target yet failed to explode; there was also a tendency to run deeper than the set depth. It took over a year for the defects to be corrected. These problems were not fixed by the time of the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942.\n\nAt Midway, a total of 41 Devastators, the majority of the type still operational, were launched from ''Hornet'', ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' to attack the Japanese fleet.<ref name=\"CV-6\"/> The sorties were not well coordinated, in part because Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]] ordered a strike on the enemy carriers immediately after they were discovered, rather than spending time assembling a well-coordinated attack involving the different types of aircraft \u2013 fighters, bombers, torpedo planes \u2013 reasoning that attacking the Japanese would prevent a counterstrike against the US carriers. The TBDs from ''Hornet'' and ''Enterprise'' lost contact with their escort and started their attacks without fighter protection.<ref>Cressman et al. 1990, pp. 84\u201389.</ref><ref name=\"Sword p206-215\">Parshall and Tulley 2005, pp. 206\u2013215.</ref>\n\nThe Devastator proved to be a death trap for its crews: slow and hardly maneuverable, with poor armor for the era; its speed on a glide-bombing approach was a mere {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, making it easy prey for fighters and defensive guns alike. The aerial torpedo could not even be released at speeds above {{convert|115|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>Jackson and Doll 1973, p. 5.</ref> Torpedo delivery requires a long, straight-line attack run, making the aircraft vulnerable, and the slow speed of the aircraft made them easy targets for the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s. Only four TBDs made it back to ''Enterprise'', none to ''Hornet'' and two to ''Yorktown'', without scoring a torpedo hit.<ref>Buell 1987, p. 494.</ref>\n\nNonetheless, their sacrifice was not completely in vain, as several TBDs managed to get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes, being close enough to be able to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to take sharp evasive maneuvers.<ref>[http://www.cv6.org/1942/midway/midway_3.htm \"USS Enterprise CV-6: The Most Decorated Ship of the Second World War, p. 3.\"] ''cv6.org''. Retrieved: 7 June 2010.</ref> By obliging the Japanese to keep their flight decks clear and to continually cycle and reinforce their [[combat air patrol]]s, they prevented any Japanese counter-attacks against the American carriers, just as Spruance had anticipated. These windows of opportunity were exploited by the late-arriving Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers led by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[C. Wade McClusky]] and [[Max Leslie]], which dive-bombed and fatally damaged three of the four Japanese carriers about one hour after the first TBD torpedo attacks had developed.<ref>Parshall and Tully 2005, pp. 215\u2013216, 226\u2013227.</ref> While the Devastators faced the stiff defenses of the carriers and their fighters, their attacks served to distract the Japanese attention from the Dauntless dive bombers' strikes, resulting in relatively lighter resistance from the IJN carriers' defensive fighter patrols, and more effective American attacks that crippled the IJN carrier forces.\n\n===Obsolescence===\nThe Navy immediately withdrew the 39 remaining TBDs from frontline units after the debacle at Midway. The surviving Devastators in VT-4 and VT-7 remained in service briefly in the Atlantic and in training squadrons until 1944.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 34.</ref> Many were relegated to training duties for pilots and mechanics or were destroyed following use as instructional airframes for firefighting training.

Ordered in 1934, it first flew in 1935 and entered service in 1937. At that point, it was the most advanced aircraft flying for the Navy and possibly for any navy in the world. However, the fast pace of aircraft development quickly caught up with it, and by the time of the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] the TBD was already outdated.\n\nThe Devastator performed well in some early battles but earned notoriety for its catastrophically poor performance in the [[Battle of Midway]] in which the 41 Devastators launched during the battle produced zero torpedo hits with only six surviving to return to their carriers. Vastly outclassed in both speed and maneuverability by the [[Mitsubishi Zero]] fighters they faced, most of the force was wiped out with little consequence except to distract the Zeros from the much more capable (and survivable) [[SBD Dauntless]] [[dive bombers]] that eventually sank four Japanese carriers and a heavy cruiser. Although a sizeable portion of the Devastator's dismal performance was later attributed to the many well-documented defects in the US [[Mark 13 torpedo]], the aircraft was immediately withdrawn from frontline service after Midway, being replaced by the [[Grumman TBF Avenger]].\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Douglas XTBD-1 in flight 1935.jpeg|thumb|The XTBD-1 with the original flat canopy in 1935]]\n[[File:TBD-1 in flight Anacostia 1937.jpg|thumb|The first production TBD-1 in 1937]]\n[[File:TBD-1A floatplane in flight 1941.jpg|thumb|A single TBD-1A was tried as a floatplane]]\n\nOrdered on 30 June 1934, and entered into a US Navy competition for new bomber aircraft to operate from its aircraft carriers, the Douglas entry was one of the winners of the competition.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 28.</ref> Other aircraft ordered for production as a result of the competition included the [[Brewster SBA]], the [[Vought SB2U Vindicator]], and the [[Northrop BT-1]] which would evolve into the [[SBD Dauntless]].<ref name=\"Doll p. 4\"/>{{#tag:ref| The [[Great Lakes XB2G]], [[Great Lakes XTBG]], [[Grumman XSBF]], [[Hall XPTBH]] and [[Vought XSB3U]] were also tendered to the specification but were not developed beyond prototype status.<ref name=\"Doll p. 4\">Doll 1992, p. 4.</ref> |group=N}}\n\nThe XTBD Devastator, which flew for the first time on 15 April 1935, marked a large number of \"firsts\" for the US Navy.<ref>Gunston 1976, p. 66.</ref> It was the first widely used carrier-based [[monoplane]] as well as the first all-metal naval aircraft, the first with a totally enclosed cockpit, the first with power-actuated (hydraulically) folding wings and in these respects the TBD was revolutionary.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 78\"/> A semi-retractable landing gear was fitted, with the wheels designed to protrude {{convert|10|in|mm|abbr=on}} below the wings to permit a \"[[belly landing|wheels-up]]\" landing which might limit damage to the aircraft. A crew of three was normally carried beneath a large \"greenhouse\" canopy almost half the length of the aircraft. The pilot sat in front; a rear gunner/radio operator took the rearmost position, while the bombardier occupied the middle seat. During a bombing run, the bombardier lay prone, sliding into position under the pilot to sight through a window in the bottom of the fuselage, using the [[Norden Bombsight]].<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\"/>\n\nThe normal TBD offensive armament consisted of either a {{convert|1935|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Bliss-Leavitt [[Mark 13 torpedo|Mark 13]] [[aerial torpedo]] or a {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} bomb, to be carried semi-recessed into a fuselage bomb bay. Alternatively, three {{convert|500|lb|kg|abbr=on}} general-purpose bombs (one under each wing root and one inside the bomb bay), or twelve {{convert|100|lb|kg|abbr=on}} fragmentation bombs (six under each wing root), could be carried. This weapons load was often used when attacking Japanese targets on the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilbert]] and [[Marshall Islands]] in 1942.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\">Winchester 2004, p. 79.</ref> Defensive armament consisted of a {{convert|.30|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine gun]] for the rear gunner. Fitted in the starboard side of the cowling was either a {{convert|.30|in|mm|2|abbr=on}} or {{convert|.50|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} [[M2 Browning machine gun]].<ref name=\"Winchester p. 79\"/>\n\nThe powerplant was a [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|Pratt & Whitney R-1830-64]] Twin Wasp [[radial engine]] of {{convert|850|hp|kW|lk=in|abbr=on}}, an outgrowth of the prototype's [[Pratt & Whitney R-1830|Pratt & Whitney XR-1830-60/R-1830-1]] of {{convert|800|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Mondey 2006, p. 128\">Mondey 2006, p. 128.</ref> Other changes from the 1935 prototype included a revised engine cowling<ref>Taylor 1969, p. 485.</ref> and raising the cockpit canopy to improve visibility.<ref name=\"Winchester p. 78\"/>\n\nThe XTBD had a flat canopy that was replaced on production models by a higher, domed canopy over a rollover bar. Other than requests by test pilots to improve pilot visibility, the prototype easily passed its acceptance trials that took place from 24 April-24 November 1935 at NAS (Naval Air Station) Anacostia and Norfolk bases. After successfully completing torpedo drop tests, the prototype was transferred to the [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|USS ''Lexington'']] for carrier certification.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 29.</ref> The extended service trials continued until 1937 with the first two production aircraft retained by the company exclusively for testing.<ref>Tillman 1973, p. 25.</ref>\n\nA total of 129 of the type were purchased by the US Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer), and starting from 1937, began to equip the carriers USS {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|2}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|2}}, {{USS| Lexington|CV-2|2}}, {{USS|Wasp|CV-7|2}}, {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}}, {{USS|Yorktown|CV-5|2}} and {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|2}}. In prewar use, TBD units were engaged in training and other operational activities and were gradually approaching the end of their useful service life with at least one aircraft being converted to target tug duty.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 32.</ref> By 1940, the US Navy was aware that the TBD had become outclassed by the fighters and bombers of other nations and a replacement {{#tag:ref|the TBF Avenger|group=N}} was in the works, but it was not yet in service when the US entered [[World War II]]. By then, attrition had reduced their numbers to just over 100 aircraft.<ref>Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 56.</ref> The US Navy assigned popular names to its aircraft in late 1941, and the TBD became the '''Devastator''', although its nickname \"torpecker\" was commonly used.<ref>Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 57.</ref>\n\nThe TBD is prominently featured in the 1941 film [[Dive Bomber (film)|''Dive Bomber'']].\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:TBD VT-6 over Wake Island 1942.jpg|thumb|A VT-6 TBD after attacking [[Wake Island]], 24 February 1942]]\n[[File:Yorktown TBD Huon Gulf March 1942.jpg|thumb|TBDs from VT-5 over the Huon Gulf, 10 March 1942]]\n[[File:TBD VT-3 Midway.jpg|thumb|A TBD-1 from VT-3 en route to the Japanese fleet at Midway]]\n[[File:Vt8tbd-t16-4june1942 waldron.jpg|thumb|right|VT-8's \"T-16\" (BuNo 1506, LCDR [[John C.

The twin .30 caliber machine guns in the rear was unique to VT-8.<ref name=\"Tillman p. 96\">Tillman 2000, p. 96.</ref>]]\n\nIn the early days of the Pacific war, the TBD acquitted itself well during February and March 1942, with TBDs from ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' attacking targets in the Marshall and Gilbert Islands, [[Wake Island|Wake]] and [[Marcus Island]]s, while TBDs from ''Yorktown'' and ''Lexington'' struck Japanese shipping off [[New Guinea]] on 10 March.<ref name=\"AI Mar90 p155\">''Air International'' March 1990, p. 155.</ref> In the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] Devastators helped sink the Japanese aircraft carrier {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dh\u014d||2}} on 7 May, but failed to hit another carrier, the {{Ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}}, the next day.<ref name=\"prof p7-8\">Doll 1967, pp. 7\u20138.</ref>\n\nFaults were discovered with the [[Mark 13 torpedo]] at this point. Many were seen to hit the target yet failed to explode; there was also a tendency to run deeper than the set depth. It took over a year for the defects to be corrected. These problems were not fixed by the time of the [[Battle of Midway]] on 4 June 1942.\n\nAt Midway, a total of 41 Devastators, the majority of the type still operational, were launched from ''Hornet'', ''Enterprise'' and ''Yorktown'' to attack the Japanese fleet.<ref name=\"CV-6\"/> The sorties were not well coordinated, in part because Rear Admiral [[Raymond A. Spruance]] ordered a strike on the enemy carriers immediately after they were discovered, rather than spending time assembling a well-coordinated attack involving the different types of aircraft \u2013 fighters, bombers, torpedo planes \u2013 reasoning that attacking the Japanese would prevent a counterstrike against the US carriers. The TBDs from ''Hornet'' and ''Enterprise'' lost contact with their escort and started their attacks without fighter protection.<ref>Cressman et al. 1990, pp. 84\u201389.</ref><ref name=\"Sword p206-215\">Parshall and Tulley 2005, pp. 206\u2013215.</ref>\n\nThe Devastator proved to be a death trap for its crews: slow and hardly maneuverable, with poor armor for the era; its speed on a glide-bombing approach was a mere {{convert|200|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, making it easy prey for fighters and defensive guns alike. The aerial torpedo could not even be released at speeds above {{convert|115|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>Jackson and Doll 1973, p. 5.</ref> Torpedo delivery requires a long, straight-line attack run, making the aircraft vulnerable, and the slow speed of the aircraft made them easy targets for the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]]s. Only four TBDs made it back to ''Enterprise'', none to ''Hornet'' and two to ''Yorktown'', without scoring a torpedo hit.<ref>Buell 1987, p. 494.</ref>\n\nNonetheless, their sacrifice was not completely in vain, as several TBDs managed to get within a few ship-lengths range of their targets before dropping their torpedoes, being close enough to be able to strafe the enemy ships and force the Japanese carriers to take sharp evasive maneuvers.<ref>[http://www.cv6.org/1942/midway/midway_3.htm \"USS Enterprise CV-6: The Most Decorated Ship of the Second World War, p. 3.\"] ''cv6.org''. Retrieved: 7 June 2010.</ref> By obliging the Japanese to keep their flight decks clear and to continually cycle and reinforce their [[combat air patrol]]s, they prevented any Japanese counter-attacks against the American carriers, just as Spruance had anticipated. These windows of opportunity were exploited by the late-arriving Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers led by [[Lieutenant Commander]] [[C. Wade McClusky]] and [[Max Leslie]], which dive-bombed and fatally damaged three of the four Japanese carriers about one hour after the first TBD torpedo attacks had developed.<ref>Parshall and Tully 2005, pp. 215\u2013216, 226\u2013227.</ref> While the Devastators faced the stiff defenses of the carriers and their fighters, their attacks served to distract the Japanese attention from the Dauntless dive bombers' strikes, resulting in relatively lighter resistance from the IJN carriers' defensive fighter patrols, and more effective American attacks that crippled the IJN carrier forces.\n\n===Obsolescence===\nThe Navy immediately withdrew the 39 remaining TBDs from frontline units after the debacle at Midway. The surviving Devastators in VT-4 and VT-7 remained in service briefly in the Atlantic and in training squadrons until 1944.<ref>Doll 1967, p. 34.</ref> Many were relegated to training duties for pilots and mechanics or were destroyed following use as instructional airframes for firefighting training. By late 1944, no TBD Devastators were left in the US Navy inventory.<ref name=\"Tillman p. 61\">Tillman and Lawson 2001, p. 61.</ref> The original prototype finished its career at [[University of Oklahoma Westheimer Airport|NAS Norman]], [[Oklahoma]]; the last TBD in the US Navy was used by the Commander of Fleet Air Activities-West Coast.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/><ref name=\"refMM\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]).<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref name=\"HIV\">  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name=\"HIV\"/><ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]].

In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors.

'''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Barbara Ahr, V\u00e9ronique Robert-Hebmann, Christian Devaux & Martine Biard-Piechaczyk | title=Apoptosis of uninfected cells induced by HIV envelope glycoproteins | journal=[[Retrovirology]] | volume=12 | year=2004 | url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-1-12 }}  </ref> However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Benjamin M Bolker, Dharmini Shah | title=Transient virulence of emerging pathogens | journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] | volume=7 | year=2010 | pages=811\u2013822 | DOI=10.1098/rsif.2009.0384}}  </ref>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits.

This led to a 90% decrease in rabbit populations, and the disease became [[endemic]] in a span of five years.

Some of these factors include virulence characteristics of the virus that is infecting. In order to cause disease, the virus must also overcome several inhibitory effects present in the host. Some of the inhibitory effects include distance, physical barriers and host defenses.

Firstly, there must be sufficient quantity of virus available to initiate infection. Cells at the site of infection must be accessible, in that they possess host factors that the virus can exploit for entry into the cell, and the host anti-viral defense systems must be ineffective or absent.<ref name =\"raca\"/><ref name=\"refMM\"/>\n\n===Implantation at point of entry===\nThe virus must implant at the entry portal of the body. Implantation is the earliest stage of pathogenesis. Implantation frequency is at its greatest where viruses directly contact living cells. Viruses usually implant on cells of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin and genital tissues.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> Some viruses are capable of implanting in a fetus through infected germ cells at the time of [[fertilization]]. Implantation can also occur later in the pregnancy via the placenta, and also at birth.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Local replication and spread=== \nFollowing implantation, the virus hijacks the host cell machinery to undergo viral amplification. Here, the virus must modulate the host innate immune response to prevent its elimination by the body while facilitating its replication. Replicated virus from the initially infected cell then disperse to infect neighbouring susceptible cells, possibly with spread to different cell types like leukocytes. This results in a [[localized disease|localised infection]], in which the virus mainly spreads and infects adjacent cells to the site of entry.<ref name=\"refMM\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\">{{cite book |title=Molecular Pathology and the Dynamics of Disease |last=Mitchell |first=Maika G.  |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/C2016-0-04893-3 |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |isbn=978-0-12-814610-1|date=2010-04-16 }}</ref>  Otherwise, the virus can be released into extracellular fluids.\nExamples of localised infections include: common cold ([[rhinovirus]]), flu ([[Human parainfluenza viruses|parainfluenza]]), gastrointestinal infections ([[rotavirus]]) or skin infections ([[Human papillomavirus infection|papillomavirus]]).<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\n===Dissemination and secondary replication=== \nIn other cases, the virus can cause [[systemic disease]] through a disseminated infection spread throughout the body. The predominant mode of viral dissemination occurs through the blood or [[lymphatic system]], some of which include viruses responsible for chickenpox ([[varicella zoster virus]]), smallpox ([[smallpox|variola]]), HIV ([[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]]). A minority of viruses can disseminate via the nervous system.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/> Notably, the [[poliovirus]] can be transmitted via the fecal-oral route, where it initially replicates in its site of entry, the small intestine and spread to regional [[lymph node]]s. Then, the virus disseminates via the bloodstream into different organs in the body (e.g. liver, spleen), followed by a secondary round of replication and dissemination into the central nervous system to damage [[motor neuron]]s.<ref name=\"sherris2014\" /> \n\n===Shedding and secondary transmission=== \nFinally, the viruses spread to sites where [[Viral shedding|shedding]] into the environment can occur. The [[respiratory]], [[alimentary]] and [[urogenital]] tracts and the blood are the most frequent sites of shedding in the form of bodily fluids, aerosols, skin, excrement. The virus would then go on to be transmitted to another person, and establish the infection cycle all over again.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"sherris2014\" /><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\n==Factors affecting pathogenesis== \nThere are a few main overarching factors affecting viral diseases:\n*Virus tropism\n*Virus factors\n*Host factors\n\n===Molecular basis of virus tropism===\n'''Virus tropism''' refers to the virus\u2019 preferential site of replication in discrete cell types within an organ. In most cases, tropism is determined by the ability of the [[viral protein|viral surface proteins]] to fuse or bind to surface receptors of specific target cells to establish infection.  Thus, the binding specificity of viral surface proteins dictates tropism as well as the destruction of particular cell populations, and is therefore a major determinant of virus pathogenesis.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\nHowever, [[co-receptor]]s are sometimes required in addition to the binding of cellular receptors on host cells to viral proteins in order to establish infection. For instance, HIV-1 requires target cells to express co-receptors [[CCR5]] or [[CXCR4]], on top of the [[CD4]] receptor for productive viral attachment.<ref name=\"HIV\">  {{Cite journal | author=Shen, H., Yin, J., Leng, F. | title=HIV coreceptor tropism determination and mutational pattern identification | journal=[[Scientific Reports]] | volume=6 | year=2016 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/srep21280 }}  </ref> Interestingly, HIV-1 can undergo a [[HIV tropism|tropism switch]], where the virus [[Envelope glycoprotein GP120|glycoprotein gp120]] initially uses CCR5 (mainly on macrophages) as the primary co-receptor for entering the host cell. Subsequently, HIV-1 switches to bind to CXCR4 (mainly on [[T cell]]s) as the infection progresses, in doing so transitions the viral pathogenicity to a different stage.<ref name=\"HIV\"/><ref name =\"robbins\" />\n \nApart from cellular receptors, viral tropism can also governed by other intracellular factors, such as tissue-specific [[transcription factors]]. An example would be the [[JC polyomavirus]], in which its tropism is limited to [[glial cells]] since its [[enhancer]] is only active in glial cells,<ref name=\"baron\"/> and JC viral gene expression requires host transcription factors expressed exclusively in glial cells.<ref name =\"robbins\"> {{cite book |title =Robbins & Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease |edition=9 |editor1=Kumar, Vinay |editor2=Abbas, Abul K. |editor3=Aster, Jon C. |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |isbn=9780323313094|date =2014 }} </ref>\n\nThe accessibility of host tissues and organs to the virus also regulates tropism. Accessibility is affected by physical barriers<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"mpdd\"/>, such as in enteroviruses, which replicate in the intestine since they are able to withstand bile, digestive enzymes and acidic environments.<ref name =\"robbins\" />\n\n===Virus factors===\nViral genetics encoding viral factors will determine the degree of viral pathogenesis. This can be measured as [[virulence]], which can be used to compare the quantitative degree of pathology between related viruses. In other words, different virus strains possessing different virus factors can lead to different degrees of virulence, which in turn can be exploited to study the differences in pathogenesis of viral variants with different virulence.<ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/><ref name=gonzalez> {{Cite journal | author=Fuentes-Gonz\u00e1lez AM, Contreras-Paredes A, Manzo-Merino J, Lizano M | title=The modulation of apoptosis by oncogenic viruses | journal=[[Virology Journal]] | volume=10 | year=2013 | doi=10.1186/1743-422X-10-182 | doi-access=free }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors are largely influenced by viral genetics, which is the virulence determinant of structural or non-structural proteins and [[non-coding DNA|non-coding sequences]]. For a virus to successfully infect and cause disease in the host, it has to encode specific virus factors in its genome to overcome the preventive effects of physical barriers, and modulate host inhibition of virus replication.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref name=\"principlesvirology\"/> In the case of poliovirus, all vaccine strains found in the oral [[polio vaccine]] contain [[attenuated vaccine|attenuating]] point mutations in the [[five prime untranslated region| 5' untranslated region]] (5' UTR). Conversely, the virulent strain responsible for causing smallpox does not contain these 5\u2019 UTR point mutations and thus display greater viral pathogenicity in hosts.<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"utr\"> {{Cite journal | author=Guti\u00e9rrez AL | title=Attenuating Mutations in the Poliovirus 5\" Untranslated Region Alter Its Interaction with Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein | journal=[[Journal of Virology]] | volume=71 | year=1997 | pages=3826\u20133833 | url=https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/71/5/3826.full.pdf }}  </ref>\n\nVirus factors encoded in the genome often control the tropism, routes of virus entry, shedding and transmission. In polioviruses, the attenuating point mutations are thought to induce a replication and [[translation]] defect to reduce the virus\u2019 ability of cross-linking to host cells and replicate within the nervous system.<ref name=\"utr\"/>\n\nViruses have also developed a variety of [[immunomodulation]] mechanisms to subvert the host immune response. This tend to feature virus-encoded decoy receptors that target [[cytokine]]s and [[chemokine]]s produced as part of the host immune response, or homologues of host cytokines.<ref name=\"veterinary virology\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Felix, J., Savvides, S. | title=Mechanisms of immunomodulation by mammalian and viral decoy receptors: insights from structures | journal=[[Nature Reviews Immunology]] | volume=17 | year=2017 | pages=112-129 | url=https://doi.org/10.1038/nri.2016.134 }}  </ref> As such, viruses capable of manipulating the host cell response to infection as an immune evasion strategy exhibit greater pathogenicity.\n\n===Host factors=== \nViral pathogenesis is also largely dependent on host factors. Several viral infections have displayed a variety of effects, ranging from [[asymptomatic]] to symptomatic or even critical infection, solely based of differing host factors alone.  In particular, genetic factors, age and [[immunocompetence]] play an important role is dictating whether the viral infection can be modulated by the host.<ref name=gonzalez/><ref name =\"modernvirology\">{{cite book |title =Introduction to modern virology |edition =7 |editor1=Nigel J.

'''Acute infections''' occur when viral replication produces factors that interfere with host cellular processes resulting in cell death. '''Persistent infections''' happen when cells continue to survive despite a viral infection and can be further classified into '''latent''' (only the viral [[genome]] is present, there is no replication occurring) and '''chronic''' (basal levels of viral replication without stimulating an immune response). In acute infections, [[lytic cycle|lytic viruses]] are shed at high titres for rapid infection to a secondary tissue/host, whereas persistent viruses undergo shedding at lower titres for a longer duration of transmission (months to years).<ref name=\"Nathanson\" /><ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nLytic viruses are capable of destroying host cells by incurring and/or interfering with the specialised functions of host cells. An example would be the triggering of [[necrosis]] in host cells infected with the virus. Otherwise, signatures of viral infection, like the binding of HIV to co-receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, can also trigger cell death via [[apoptosis]] through host signalling cascades by immune cells.<ref> {{Cite journal | author=Barbara Ahr, V\u00e9ronique Robert-Hebmann, Christian Devaux & Martine Biard-Piechaczyk | title=Apoptosis of uninfected cells induced by HIV envelope glycoproteins | journal=[[Retrovirology]] | volume=12 | year=2004 | url=https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4690-1-12 }}  </ref> However, many viruses encode proteins that can modulate apoptosis depending on whether the infection is acute or persistent. Induction of apoptosis, such as through interaction with [[caspase]]s, will promote viral shedding for lytic viruses to facilitate transmission, while viral inhibition of apoptosis could prolong the production of virus in cells, or allow the virus to remain hidden from the immune system in chronic, persistent infections.<ref name =\"robbins\" /><ref name=gonzalez/> Nevertheless, induction of apoptosis in major immune cells or [[antigen-presenting cell]]s may also act as a mechanism of [[immunosuppression]] in persistent infections like HIV.

The incubation period refers to the time taken for the onset of disease after first contact with the virus. The incubation period typically varies with the distance traversed by the virus to the target organ. Viruses that travel a short distance to reach their target organ have a short incubation period of one to three days. On the other hand, with generalized infections, the incubation period is longer, ranging from months to years, because of how long it takes the virus to move throughout the body and reach the target organs. Surprisingly, generalised infections by [[togaviruses]] have a short incubation period due to the direct entry of the virus into target cells through insect bites.<ref name=\"mpdd\"/>\n\nThere are several other factors that affect the incubation period. The mechanisms behind long incubation periods, months or years for example, are not completely understood yet.\n\n==Evolution of virulence==\nAs with all parasites, [[natural selection]] favours the survival of low-virulence virus strains.<ref name=\"baron\"/> Many relatively avirulent viruses in their natural host show increased virulence upon transfer to a new host species. When an [[emergent virus|emerging virus]] first invades a new host species, the hosts have little or no immunity against the virus and often suffer high [[Mortality rate|mortality]].  Hosts that survive do so because they possess a set of advantageous genes that are favourable to the [[selection pressure]], that prevents the host from dying due to infection of the novel pathogen.  These survivors then reproduce and pass on the favourable genes to their offspring while hosts that do not possess those genes are slowly eradicated by [[natural selection]], resulting in lower mortality rates in future generations.<ref name=\"baron\"/>\n\nOver time, a decrease in virulence in the predominant strain is usually observed. This is because there is usually little advantage for a pathogen to kill the host before dispersal to new hosts, so viruses may evolve naturally to become less virulent to prolong survival in infected hosts to boost transmission. Likewise, the host will evolve to develop genetic resistance against the virus over time.<ref name=\"baron\"/><ref>  {{Cite journal | author=Benjamin M Bolker, Dharmini Shah | title=Transient virulence of emerging pathogens | journal=[[Journal of the Royal Society Interface]] | volume=7 | year=2010 | pages=811\u2013822 | DOI=10.1098/rsif.2009.0384}}  </ref>\n\nA paradigm of the evolution of virulence in emerging virus is the case of [[myxomatosis]] in rabbits.
