The mechanic believes the car will last a long time, but when Walt puts on the hat he dons for his Heisenberg persona, his pride takes over. Walt impulsively sells the Aztek to the mechanic for $50, leases a new [[Chrysler 300]] for himself, and later leases a new [[Dodge Challenger]] for Walt Jr.\n\nAt Madrigal's [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] branch, [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Lydia Rodarte-Quayle|Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] receives a call from [[Mike Ehrmantraut]], who warns her that the police are about to arrive. She escorts [[Hank Schrader]], [[Steven Gomez]], and other officers to the Madrigal warehouse and points out foreman Ron, who was supplying her with [[methylamine]]. Mike reassures Lydia that Ron will not talk, adding that she will have a new guy in the warehouse soon. Walt presents [[Skyler White]] with a stack of newly-earned drug money, saying they have to recoup the [[Crawl Space (Breaking Bad)#Plot|lost $600,000]]. After her suggestion of sending the kids to boarding school is struck down by Walter, he mentions that she should throw him a party for his 51st birthday.\n\nThe next day, [[Special agent#Other titles|SAC]] Ramey offers Hank the position of ASAC vacated by Merkert. Hank accepts, even though his pursuit of Heisenberg will be given to a field agent. That evening, the Whites and the Schraders finish a meager birthday dinner in the backyard \u2014 a noticeable shift from the well-attended surprise party [[Pilot (Breaking Bad)|one year before]]. After Walt Jr. leaves, Walt notes that it has been a year since his cancer diagnosis. As he reflects, a fully clothed Skyler steps into the pool and slowly submerges herself. [[Marie Schrader|Marie]] panics while Walt jumps in to pull her out.\n\nAt the warehouse, Lydia leads [[Jesse Pinkman]] to a barrel of methylamine. As Jesse lowers the barrel with a forklift, Lydia points her flashlight at a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] tracker affixed to the bottom of the barrel, forcing them to leave empty-handed. Back at the house, Walt learns that Skyler has asked Marie and Hank to look after the kids until her issues with Walt are resolved. Walt tentatively agrees though he considers it a temporary arrangement. Skyler insists that she will not have her children living in a house where dangerous events that occur are just shrugged off. She threatens to further harm herself, to fake spousal abuse and to send Walt Jr. to boarding school if Walt brings the kids back home, but he belittles her plans as unworkable. Breaking down and realizing there is no way out of her situation without hurting her family, she relents to his arguments but not without admitting to him that her only option is to hope that Walt's cancer will come back and kill him.\n\nThe next day at Vamonos Pest, Mike is skeptical that the tracker was planted by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] because of its crude placement on the bottom of the barrel. When informed by Jesse that it was Lydia who spotted it first, Mike concludes that Lydia planted it herself in order to get out of their deal and vows to kill her. Jesse pleads for Mike to show mercy and asks for Walt's opinion. Walt votes to keep her alive so no time is lost finding a new precursor supplier. Jesse later gives Walt a [[TAG Heuer Monaco]] wristwatch as a birthday present, which pleases Walt. At home, Walt informs a chain-smoking Skyler that more money is coming. He shows off Jesse's gift as proof that Skyler will eventually forgive him, as Jesse once wanted him dead too.
