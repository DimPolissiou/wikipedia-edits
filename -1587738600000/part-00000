Arguments have been made that the college was named for [[Calvinist]] leader [[John Knox]], but it is not certain for which Knox it was named (if not both). George Candee Gale, a great-great-grandson of two of the founders, explains that\n\n<blockquote>contrary to general belief, Knox was not named for either General Knox or the Scottish Presbyterian Knox, according to my father ...Some wanted the college named for one Knox, some for the other; so they compromised on KNOX. Certainly most of them were pious enough to want the churchman and fighters enough to want the soldier as well.\"<ref>Calkins, Earnest Elmo.

This had the standard [[Smith & Wesson]] revolvers and was on patrol at all times. Following their success, forces outside of the capital later formed similar units during the early to mid-1990s.

The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and perform institutional leadership.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nHeated wrangling took place between the cities of [[Calgary]] and Edmonton over the location of the provincial capital and of the university. It was stated that the capital would be north of the North Saskatchewan River and that the university would be in a city south of it.<ref name=Rutherford/> The city of Edmonton became the capital and the then-separate city of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]] on the south bank of the river, where Premier Alexander Rutherford lived, was granted the university. When the two cities were [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] in 1912, Edmonton became both the political and academic capital.\n\nWith [[Henry Marshall Tory]] as its first president, the University of Alberta started operation in 1908. Forty-five students attended classes in English, mathematics and modern languages, on the top floor of the Queen Alexandra Elementary School in Strathcona, while the first campus building, Athabasca Hall, was under construction.<ref name=MacLeod>\"All True Things: A History of the University of Alberta, 1908\u20132008\", Rod Macleod, The University of Alberta Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-88864-444-2}}</ref> In a letter to [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] in early 1906, while he was in the process of setting up [[University of British Columbia|McGill University College]] in [[Vancouver]], Tory wrote, ''\"If you take any steps in the direction of a working University and wish to avoid the mistakes of the past, mistakes which have fearfully handicapped other institutions, you should start on a teaching basis.\"''<ref name=ToryQuote>Tory to Rutherford,  March 6, 1906.

But along with these early milestones came the First World War and the global influenza pandemic of 1918, whose toll on the university resulted in a two-month suspension of classes in the fall of 1918.<ref name=MacLeod /> Despite these setbacks, the university continued to grow. By 1920, it had six faculties (Arts and Sciences, Applied Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Dentistry, and Law) and two schools (Pharmacy and Accountancy).

Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> In 1929, the university established a College of Education. This period of growth was to be short-lived, though, as the Great Depression and the Second World War curtailed enrolment and expansion until 1945.<ref name=Centenary /> The university also gained new public powers.

In addition, the single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities. On September 19, 1960, the university opened a new 130-hectare campus in Calgary.<ref name=\"pound2005\">{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}</ref> By 1966, the [[University of Calgary]] had been established as an autonomous institution.<ref name=\"MacLeod\" />\n\nFrom the mid-1970s to the late 1980s, the university enjoyed sustained growth. In 1970, the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Jean began offering French-language instruction in arts, science and education. In 1984, the School of Native Studies was established. Buildings that had been started in the 1960s, such as Biological Sciences and the Central Academic Building, were completed in the early 1970s. Extensive renovations restored the venerable Arts Building, as well as the Athabasca and Pembina halls.<ref name=Centenary /> New buildings completed in the early 1980s included the Business Building and the first phase of the Walter C.

Another new building, the distinctive Universiade Pavilion (nicknamed the \"Butterdome\"), was completed as part of the university's preparations to host the World University Games in 1983, the first time the event was held in North America.<ref name=Centenary />\n\nThe 1990s were a time of financial constraint as the Alberta government made budgetary cutbacks.<ref name=MacLeod /> but they were also a time in which the university benefited from philanthropic support. The $11-million Timms Centre for the Arts, which began construction in 1993, was made possible by a large donation from its namesake, Albert Timms.<ref name=Centenary /> In 1998, Gladys Young's $3.5-million donation to the university undergraduate scholarship fund in memory of Roland Young, who graduated from the U of A in 1928, was the largest private donation for undergraduate scholarships in the university's history.<ref name=\"pound2005\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Cobalt king remembers U of A with $3.5 million|url=http://www.folio.ualberta.ca/36/13/front.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130101075021/http://www.folio.ualberta.ca/36/13/front.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 January 2013|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=31 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe early 2000s brought substantial funding increases.

Sichel S\u00f6hne]] ([[Mainz#Wine centre|Mainz]]) in 1923 with the 1921 vintage, and which between the 1950s and 1980s was a very popular international brand. For most of its existence, Blue Nun was a single German wine, which until the late 1990s was classified as a [[Liebfraumilch]], but the name is now used for a whole range of wines of various origins. When it was created, the label was designed as a consumer-friendly alternative to the [[German wine classification|innumerable German wine labels]] with Gothic script and long, complicated names. With the creation of its UK office in 1927, Sichel targeted the export market. Beginning in the 1950s, Blue Nun was advertised as a wine that could be drunk throughout an entire meal, thereby eliminating the often intimidating problem of [[wine and food pairing]]. Blue Nun can be said to have been the first wine to have been produced and effectively marketed with an international mass market in mind.\n\nAfter World War II, the brand became spectacularly popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, selling for the same price as a second growth red [[Bordeaux wine]]. At its peak of popularity in 1984\u20131985, annual sales in the US were 1.25 million cases, with another 750,000 cases sold elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book| editor = [[Jancis Robinson]] | title = [[The Oxford Companion to Wine]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | edition = 3rd  |year= 2006 | isbn = 978-0-19-860990-2 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s in the USA, a series of radio adverts promoting the wine were produced, featuring [[Stiller and Meara]].<ref>Rein, Richard K. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067899,00.html \"Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara Had to Break Out of Their Act to Keep It Together\"] ''People'', May 23, 1977</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1980s, and more so in the 1990s, easy-drinking semi-sweet German wines began to decline in popularity. Consequently, the brand's popularity declined, and the wine began to be perceived as tacky and dated. This change was reflected in the drink of choice of a popular fictional over-the-hill British television and radio presenter, [[Alan Partridge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/food.cfm?id=713322006|title=Scotsman.com Living<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref> However, sales increased after Blue Nun was purchased by the [[Mosel wine|Mosel]]-based German family firm [[Franz Wilhelm Langguth Erben|Langguth]] which bought the previous owners, Sichel, in 1996. They repositioned the brand, reclassifying it from a [[Liebfraumilch]] to a regular ''[[Qualit\u00e4tswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete]]'' (QbA), changing the grapes from [[M\u00fcller-Thurgau]] to 30% [[Riesling]], and making it less sweet. It remains relatively low in alcohol at 9.5%.\n\n==Brand extension==\nFrom 2001 on, Langguth also embarked on a brand extension, and has introduced several other wines under the Blue Nun name, including a German Riesling [[ice wine]], a [[Languedoc]] [[Merlot]] and a Spanish [[ros\u00e9]]. Sales in 2004 rose by 11% in the UK, but from a low base.\n\nIn 2009, Blue Nun launched ''Blue Nun Gold'', a [[sparkling wine]] which contains flakes of 22-carat gold. It was hoped the drink will appeal to young women drinkers, and will help position the brand differently.<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?Blue_Nun_wine_is_going_for_gold&in_article_id=670841&in_page_id=34&in_a_source= \"Blue Nun Wine is going for gold\"], ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]Online'', 27 May 2009</ref>\n\n==References to Blue Nun in popular culture and media==\n\n===In music===\n[[Afro Celt Sound System]], in their song \"Rise Above It\" from the album ''[[Seed (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Seed]]'', refer to dancing at gigs with Blue Nun.

Blue Nun can be said to have been the first wine to have been produced and effectively marketed with an international mass market in mind.\n\nAfter World War II, the brand became spectacularly popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, selling for the same price as a second growth red [[Bordeaux wine]]. At its peak of popularity in 1984\u20131985, annual sales in the US were 1.25 million cases, with another 750,000 cases sold elsewhere.<ref>{{cite book| editor = [[Jancis Robinson]] | title = [[The Oxford Companion to Wine]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | edition = 3rd  |year= 2006 | isbn = 978-0-19-860990-2 }}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s in the USA, a series of radio adverts promoting the wine were produced, featuring [[Stiller and Meara]].<ref>Rein, Richard K. [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20067899,00.html \"Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara Had to Break Out of Their Act to Keep It Together\"] ''People'', May 23, 1977</ref>\n\nFrom the late 1980s, and more so in the 1990s, easy-drinking semi-sweet German wines began to decline in popularity. Consequently, the brand's popularity declined, and the wine began to be perceived as tacky and dated. This change was reflected in the drink of choice of a popular fictional over-the-hill British television and radio presenter, [[Alan Partridge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/food.cfm?id=713322006|title=Scotsman.com Living<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref> However, sales increased after Blue Nun was purchased by the [[Mosel wine|Mosel]]-based German family firm [[Franz Wilhelm Langguth Erben|Langguth]] which bought the previous owners, Sichel, in 1996. They repositioned the brand, reclassifying it from a [[Liebfraumilch]] to a regular ''[[Qualit\u00e4tswein bestimmter Anbaugebiete]]'' (QbA), changing the grapes from [[M\u00fcller-Thurgau]] to 30% [[Riesling]], and making it less sweet. It remains relatively low in alcohol at 9.5%.\n\n==Brand extension==\nFrom 2001 on, Langguth also embarked on a brand extension, and has introduced several other wines under the Blue Nun name, including a German Riesling [[ice wine]], a [[Languedoc]] [[Merlot]] and a Spanish [[ros\u00e9]]. Sales in 2004 rose by 11% in the UK, but from a low base.\n\nIn 2009, Blue Nun launched ''Blue Nun Gold'', a [[sparkling wine]] which contains flakes of 22-carat gold. It was hoped the drink will appeal to young women drinkers, and will help position the brand differently.<ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?Blue_Nun_wine_is_going_for_gold&in_article_id=670841&in_page_id=34&in_a_source= \"Blue Nun Wine is going for gold\"], ''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]Online'', 27 May 2009</ref>\n\n==References to Blue Nun in popular culture and media==\n\n===In music===\n[[Afro Celt Sound System]], in their song \"Rise Above It\" from the album ''[[Seed (Afro Celt Sound System album)|Seed]]'', refer to dancing at gigs with Blue Nun.

It is bounded by East 7th Street to the south, East Atherton Street to the north, Bellflower Boulevard to the west, and Palo Verde Avenue to the east.\n\n===Architecture===\nThe architecture of the campus is mostly of the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] (designed primarily by architect [[Edward Killingsworth]]) and is very minimalist, placing emphasis instead on the landscaping that surrounds it. This naturalistic, park-like layout has earned the campus numerous design awards, as well as other awards from gardening societies. Recent construction maintains the characteristic glass-and-brick style. The integration of landscaping and architecture is apparent at the school's theater complex, where a dense grove of [[ficus]] trees is planted in such a way that it forms a continuation of the pillar-supported canopy at the theater's entrance. The university's registration offices are located in the open courtyard of Brotman Hall, which is \"roofed\" by a similar jungle-like canopy. The [[Psychology]] building is also notable for its soaring, airy courtyard planted with tall [[Eucalyptus]] trees.\n\n===Campus landmarks===\n[[Image:Walter Pyramid.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Walter Pyramid]], the university's most prominent sporting complex and most recognizable landmark.]]\n\nThe University Student Union (USU) building is located at the center of campus. The three-story glass building occupies roughly {{convert|180000|sqft|m2}}, housing numerous offices, and offering more casual attractions, including a study lounge, a ballroom, a food court, a bowling alley, an arcade, and a movie theater.\n\nThe Rec and Wellness Center is an extensive all-purpose athletic center covering about {{convert|125000|sqft|m2}} on North Campus. It was completed in 2010. It includes facilities for fitness programs and aerobics classes, courts for volleyball, basketball, badminton, rock climbing walls, an indoor track, a student lounge, and much more.

The Pyramid is a sporting complex that can accommodate over 5,000 fans, including temporary seating and standing room. Two sections of interior stands are fitted with large [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] lifts that can lift the seating elements 45 degrees into the air, creating room for five volleyball courts or three basketball courts.<ref name=\"pyramid\">{{cite web|url=http://www.longbeachstate.com/local/facilities/pyramid.html |title=The Pyramid | accessdate=July 13, 2007 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991001194755/http://www.longbeachstate.com/local/facilities/pyramid.html |archivedate=October 1, 1999  }}</ref> The Pyramid is home to the [[Southern California Summer Pro League]], a noted showcase for current and prospective NBA basketball players.\n\nThe University Art Museum's permanent collection contains primarily abstract expressionist paintings, works on paper, and an outdoor sculpture garden that began in 1966.

The ''Union Weekly'' focuses on being an alternative voice on campus and features a satirical section called \"The Grunion\" (not to be confused with the Long Beach paper the Grunion Gazette). During the late 1970s through 1980s, the ''Union'' was a daily newspaper, giving heavy competition to the ''Daily 49er''. Journalism majors who worked on the \"Union\" did so under a pseudonym as it was a practice forbidden by the dean of the Journalism department.\n\n''DIG Magazine'', the campus magazine, has gone through many changes throughout the years. It started off as ''The Lantern'', a magazine for night-time students, before transforming to ''UniverCity'' in 1973. Then, it turned into ''University Magazine.'' In the early 2000s, the magazine transformed to ''DIG Magazine'' as a music magazine before transitioning to a general art & culture magazine.

Six sculptors from abroad and two from the United States created many of the monumental sculptures present on the campus. The event received national media attention from newspapers around the country, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Los Angeles Times]] Magazine'', ''[[Art in America]]'' and a six-page color spread in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-getty-cal-state-long-beach-sculpture-park-20150324-column.html|title=Why the Getty is giving Cal State Long Beach's 1960s sculpture park a fresh look|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=March 26, 2015|first=Carolina A. |last=Miranda|accessdate=April 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMcIntosh departed for [[Montana State University]] in 1969, and was succeeded by President [[Steve Horn]]. The [[California State University]] Board of Trustees elevated the school to university status in 1972, along with 12 other state college campuses. The decision was made based on total enrollment, size of graduate programs, complexity and diversity of majors and number of doctorates held by faculty at each college. CSCLB thus became '''California State University, Long Beach,''' or CSULB.\n\nAlso in 1972, the campus became the home of the largest library facility in the then 19-campus CSU system: a modern six-story building with a [[seating capacity]] of nearly 4,000 students.\n\nIn 1995, President [[Robert Maxson]] initiated the privately funded President's Scholars Program, providing selected qualified California high school [[valedictorian]]s and [[National Merit]] finalists and semi-finalists with a full four-year scholarship package, including tuition, a book stipend, and housing. {{As of|2010|May}}, over 1000 students have accepted the scholarship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://karl.papubs.csulb.edu/news-events/story.cfm?hackid=1014 |title=Cal State Long Beach Welcoming Incoming Class of 52 New President\u2019s Scholars to Campus This Week |accessdate=September 4, 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114064256/http://karl.papubs.csulb.edu/news-events/story.cfm?hackid=1014 |archivedate=January 14, 2009  }}</ref> For applicants for Fall 2010, National Achievement Program Semifinalists/Finalists and National Hispanic Recognition scholars were also considered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.csulb.edu/divisions/students/presidents_scholars/application_process/ |title=Application Process, President's Scholars Program, CSULB |publisher=Csulb.edu |accessdate=February 9, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201193829/http://www.csulb.edu/divisions/students/presidents_scholars/application_process/ |archivedate=February 1, 2014  }}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nThe campus spans {{convert|323|acre|ha}} across 84 buildings, and is located {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} from the Pacific Ocean. It has its own U.S. Postal [[ZIP Code]], 90840. CSULB is located at 1250 Bellflower Boulevard. It is bounded by East 7th Street to the south, East Atherton Street to the north, Bellflower Boulevard to the west, and Palo Verde Avenue to the east.\n\n===Architecture===\nThe architecture of the campus is mostly of the [[International style (architecture)|International style]] (designed primarily by architect [[Edward Killingsworth]]) and is very minimalist, placing emphasis instead on the landscaping that surrounds it. This naturalistic, park-like layout has earned the campus numerous design awards, as well as other awards from gardening societies. Recent construction maintains the characteristic glass-and-brick style. The integration of landscaping and architecture is apparent at the school's theater complex, where a dense grove of [[ficus]] trees is planted in such a way that it forms a continuation of the pillar-supported canopy at the theater's entrance. The university's registration offices are located in the open courtyard of Brotman Hall, which is \"roofed\" by a similar jungle-like canopy. The [[Psychology]] building is also notable for its soaring, airy courtyard planted with tall [[Eucalyptus]] trees.\n\n===Campus landmarks===\n[[Image:Walter Pyramid.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Walter Pyramid]], the university's most prominent sporting complex and most recognizable landmark.]]\n\nThe University Student Union (USU) building is located at the center of campus.

It was completed in 2010. It includes facilities for fitness programs and aerobics classes, courts for volleyball, basketball, badminton, rock climbing walls, an indoor track, a student lounge, and much more.

The Pyramid is a sporting complex that can accommodate over 5,000 fans, including temporary seating and standing room.

It started off as ''The Lantern'', a magazine for night-time students, before transforming to ''UniverCity'' in 1973. Then, it turned into ''University Magazine.'' In the early 2000s, the magazine transformed to ''DIG Magazine'' as a music magazine before transitioning to a general art & culture magazine. Today, the magazine features interesting people and groups within the community, and discusses topics that concern students' interests.\n\n===KKJZ 88.1 FM===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:2em; margin:auto;\"\n|+ ''Fall 2018 Demographics of student body''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calstate.edu/as/stat_reports/2018-2019/feth02.htm|title=Ethnicity Enrollment Profile|website=www.calstate.edu|access-date=2019-07-09}}</ref>\n! !! * All levels, freshman through graduate   \n|-\n!

Up until this point, Oklahoma's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] tendencies changed with the election of Oklahoma's first [[Governor of Oklahoma|governor]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Charles N. Haskell]]. Since the inception of the university, different groups on campus were divided by religion. Early in the university's existence, many professors were [[Presbyterian]], as was Boyd. Under pressure, Boyd eventually hired several [[Baptists]] and Southern [[Methodist]]s.<ref>{{cite news|first=David W.|last=Levy |url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/sooner/articles/p28-30_1996v16n3_OCR.pdf|title=Combating the Image of \"Godlessness\" in 1909|publisher=Sooner Magazine|pages=28\u201330|date=Spring 1996 |accessdate=July 3, 2006 }}</ref> The Presbyterians and Baptists got along but the Southern Methodists conflicted with the administration.

When Haskell took office, he fired many of the Republicans at the university, including President Boyd.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |first=David |title=The University of Oklahoma: A History |series=Volume I, 1890\u20131917 |pages=165\u201366, 172\u2013173 |isbn=978-0-8061-1241-1 |publisher=Norman, University of Oklahoma Press [1975] |year=1975 }}</ref>\n\nThe campus expanded over the next several decades. By 1932, the university encompassed {{convert|167|acre|km2|1|sp=us}}. Development of South Oval allowed for the southern expansion of the campus. The university built a new library on the oval's north end in 1936. Then President Bizzell was able to get the Oklahoma legislature to approve $500,000 for the new library up from their original offer of $200,000. This allowed for an even greater collection of research materials for students and faculty.<ref name=\"boydyears\"/>\n\n[[File:Brooks Inauguration 1912.jpg|left|thumb|[[Stratton D.

In 1994, the university hired a president who has stayed longer.\n\nThe [[Civil Rights Movement]] began a new era as the university began policies against racial discrimination and segregation after legal challenges and court cases outlawed discrimination. The [[Bizzell Memorial Library]] has been designated a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] in commemoration of the cases of G. W. McLaurin, a black man who was denied admission to graduate school in 1948. It was then state law that no school should serve both white and black students, but there were few or no separate graduate programs available for blacks. A court case effectively forced the Board of Regents to vote to admit McLaurin, but he was directed to study in a separated area within the law library and to be allowed to lunch only in a segregated area as well. The National Association for Advancement of Colored People brought the case to the U.S. Supreme court in ''[[McLaurin vs. Oklahoma State Board of Regents]]''. In 1950, the court overturned the university's policy for segregation at the graduate school level. The case was an important precedent for the more famous and sweeping 1954 case of ''[[Brown v.

The campus is scheduled to be dedicated in the summer of 2016.  Boren chose the smaller town of Arezzo in part because of the small size of the town relative to nearby [[Florence]], which boasts programs from about 50 American universities.  With such a large number of American college students in Florence, Boren was concerned that OU students would have socialized with other Americans rather than the local Italians.<ref name=Arezzo/>\n\n===Other study centers===\nOU has study centers in [[Puebla City|Puebla, Mexico]] and [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]].

The North and South Ovals are now distinctive features of the campus.\n\nThe campus has a distinctive architecture, with buildings designed in a unique \"[[Cherokee Gothic]]\" style. The style has many features of the Gothic era but has also mixed the designs of local Native American tribes from Oklahoma.

Up until this point, Oklahoma's [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] tendencies changed with the election of Oklahoma's first [[Governor of Oklahoma|governor]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Charles N. Haskell]]. Since the inception of the university, different groups on campus were divided by religion. Early in the university's existence, many professors were [[Presbyterian]], as was Boyd. Under pressure, Boyd eventually hired several [[Baptists]] and Southern [[Methodist]]s.<ref>{{cite news|first=David W.|last=Levy |url=http://digital.libraries.ou.edu/sooner/articles/p28-30_1996v16n3_OCR.pdf|title=Combating the Image of \"Godlessness\" in 1909|publisher=Sooner Magazine|pages=28\u201330|date=Spring 1996 |accessdate=July 3, 2006 }}</ref> The Presbyterians and Baptists got along but the Southern Methodists conflicted with the administration.

When Haskell took office, he fired many of the Republicans at the university, including President Boyd.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levy |first=David |title=The University of Oklahoma: A History |series=Volume I, 1890\u20131917 |pages=165\u201366, 172\u2013173 |isbn=978-0-8061-1241-1 |publisher=Norman, University of Oklahoma Press [1975] |year=1975 }}</ref>\n\nThe campus expanded over the next several decades. By 1932, the university encompassed {{convert|167|acre|km2|1|sp=us}}. Development of South Oval allowed for the southern expansion of the campus. The university built a new library on the oval's north end in 1936. Then President Bizzell was able to get the Oklahoma legislature to approve $500,000 for the new library up from their original offer of $200,000. This allowed for an even greater collection of research materials for students and faculty.<ref name=\"boydyears\"/>\n\n[[File:Brooks Inauguration 1912.jpg|left|thumb|[[Stratton D.

In 1994, the university hired a president who has stayed longer.\n\nThe [[Civil Rights Movement]] began a new era as the university began policies against racial discrimination and segregation after legal challenges and court cases outlawed discrimination. The [[Bizzell Memorial Library]] has been designated a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]] in commemoration of the cases of G. W. McLaurin, a black man who was denied admission to graduate school in 1948. It was then state law that no school should serve both white and black students, but there were few or no separate graduate programs available for blacks. A court case effectively forced the Board of Regents to vote to admit McLaurin, but he was directed to study in a separated area within the law library and to be allowed to lunch only in a segregated area as well. The National Association for Advancement of Colored People brought the case to the U.S. Supreme court in ''[[McLaurin vs. Oklahoma State Board of Regents]]''. In 1950, the court overturned the university's policy for segregation at the graduate school level. The case was an important precedent for the more famous and sweeping 1954 case of ''[[Brown v.

In 1945, UA's newly established four-year [[University of Alabama School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] moved from Tuscaloosa to Birmingham and took over management of Jefferson and Hillman hospitals. In 1957 enrollment at the extension center stood at 1,856. By 1959, research grants, training grants, and fellowships exceeded $1 million, and ground was broken for a new Children's Hospital.\n\nBy the 1960s, it grew apparent that the extension center was becoming a university in its own right. An engineering building was built close to the medical center in 1962, and in November 1966, the Extension Center and the School of Medicine were merged into the '''University of Alabama in Birmingham''', with Dr. Joseph Volker as \"Vice President for Birmingham Affairs\"\u2013reflecting that it was still treated as an offsite department of the main campus in Tuscaloosa. An Advisory Board for UAB was created in 1967. In 1969, the legislature created the [[University of Alabama System]]. UAB became one of three four-year institutions within the new system, which also included UA and the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH) in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]].  Volker became UAB's first president.<ref name=\"Chronology\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s, the university began a period of rapid growth. Enrollment at the beginning of the decade stood at 6,629, including 2,724 women. To accommodate the growing student population, UAB acquired land in the [[Southside (Birmingham)|Southside]]. UAB Mini Park (the predecessor to The UAB Green) was dedicated in 1977.\n\nThe university created an intercollegiate athletic program, joined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and began fielding teams beginning with golf in 1970 and men's basketball in 1978. The university's name was changed to the '''University of Alabama at Birmingham''' in 1984, simply exchanging the preposition \"In\" for \"at.\"\n\nBy 1990, UAB had awarded its 50,000th degree. In 1992, ''U.S. News and World Report'' named UAB as the #1 up-and-coming university in the United States. In 1993, UAB's economic impact on the Birmingham region was estimated at more than $1.5 billion per year (the figure would be $2 billion per year by 1998). In 1994, UAB became the first Alabama university to achieve \"Research University I\" status in the [[List of research universities in the United States|Carnegie Foundation classification]].\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:University of Alabama at Birmingham Campus from Vulcan.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|right|UAB campus and downtown Birmingham]]\nUAB is located in the [[Southside (Birmingham)|Southside]] neighborhood of downtown Birmingham.

University Boulevard serves as the main axis of the rectangle and Campus Green sits approximately at the center.\n\nThe campus can be divided into three sections. The medical center occupies most of the campus east of Campus Green. The medical center is home to the health science schools and their teaching facilities, including the UAB Health System (UABHS). The medical center overlaps with the larger Birmingham Medical District where, in addition to UABHS, non-UAB affiliated hospitals such as the VA Medical Center Birmingham, Children's Hospital of Alabama and Cooper Green Mercy Hospital are located.\n\nThe academic heart of campus stretches from the Campus Green west and from University Boulevard south. Campus Green, developed between 2000 and 2007 as part of the move to convert the school from its previously commuter school feel into a more traditional residential campus, not only anchors the academic campus but serves as the centerpiece for the university as a whole.

Bartow left UCLA after several exceptional seasons (52\u20139 over three seasons, including a berth in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]] in 1976) to head up the founding of the first UAB men's basketball team. He served as the school's first head basketball coach and [[athletic director]] for 18 years. Bartow led UAB to the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] in the program's second year of existence, and followed that with seven straight [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances, including trips to the Sweet 16 in 1981 and the Elite Eight in 1982. Bartow retired from coaching in 1996 and, in 1997, UAB renamed its basketball venue from UAB Arena to Bartow Arena in his honor. In 30 years, UAB has made 13 NCAA appearances, three Sweet Sixteen appearances and an Elite Eight appearance, and has had 27 winning seasons, 19 of which were 20+ win seasons.\n\nIn addition to [[basketball]], UAB has programs in men's sports for [[baseball]], [[golf]], [[Association football|soccer]], and [[tennis]].

In 1945, UA's newly established four-year [[University of Alabama School of Medicine|School of Medicine]] moved from Tuscaloosa to Birmingham and took over management of Jefferson and Hillman hospitals. In 1957 enrollment at the extension center stood at 1,856. By 1959, research grants, training grants, and fellowships exceeded $1 million, and ground was broken for a new Children's Hospital.\n\nBy the 1960s, it grew apparent that the extension center was becoming a university in its own right. An engineering building was built close to the medical center in 1962, and in November 1966, the Extension Center and the School of Medicine were merged into the '''University of Alabama in Birmingham''', with Dr. Joseph Volker as \"Vice President for Birmingham Affairs\"\u2013reflecting that it was still treated as an offsite department of the main campus in Tuscaloosa. An Advisory Board for UAB was created in 1967. In 1969, the legislature created the [[University of Alabama System]]. UAB became one of three four-year institutions within the new system, which also included UA and the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH) in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]].  Volker became UAB's first president.<ref name=\"Chronology\"/>\n\nIn the 1970s, the university began a period of rapid growth. Enrollment at the beginning of the decade stood at 6,629, including 2,724 women. To accommodate the growing student population, UAB acquired land in the [[Southside (Birmingham)|Southside]]. UAB Mini Park (the predecessor to The UAB Green) was dedicated in 1977.\n\nThe university created an intercollegiate athletic program, joined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and began fielding teams beginning with golf in 1970 and men's basketball in 1978. The university's name was changed to the '''University of Alabama at Birmingham''' in 1984, simply exchanging the preposition \"In\" for \"at.\"\n\nBy 1990, UAB had awarded its 50,000th degree. In 1992, ''U.S. News and World Report'' named UAB as the #1 up-and-coming university in the United States. In 1993, UAB's economic impact on the Birmingham region was estimated at more than $1.5 billion per year (the figure would be $2 billion per year by 1998). In 1994, UAB became the first Alabama university to achieve \"Research University I\" status in the [[List of research universities in the United States|Carnegie Foundation classification]].\n\n== Campus ==\n[[File:University of Alabama at Birmingham Campus from Vulcan.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|right|UAB campus and downtown Birmingham]]\nUAB is located in the [[Southside (Birmingham)|Southside]] neighborhood of downtown Birmingham.

University Boulevard serves as the main axis of the rectangle and Campus Green sits approximately at the center.\n\nThe campus can be divided into three sections. The medical center occupies most of the campus east of Campus Green. The medical center is home to the health science schools and their teaching facilities, including the UAB Health System (UABHS). The medical center overlaps with the larger Birmingham Medical District where, in addition to UABHS, non-UAB affiliated hospitals such as the VA Medical Center Birmingham, Children's Hospital of Alabama and Cooper Green Mercy Hospital are located.\n\nThe academic heart of campus stretches from the Campus Green west and from University Boulevard south. Campus Green, developed between 2000 and 2007 as part of the move to convert the school from its previously commuter school feel into a more traditional residential campus, not only anchors the academic campus but serves as the centerpiece for the university as a whole. Most academics and arts buildings (excluding those associated with the medical center), residence halls, and student life facilities sit on or within two blocks of the Green.\n[[File:CAMPUS GREEN.jpg|thumb|Students relaxing on Campus Green]]\n\nAthletics facilities, including [[Bartow Arena]], are located on the far western side of campus.\n\nSince 1969, UAB has undergone extensive growth and construction projects are common across campus.
