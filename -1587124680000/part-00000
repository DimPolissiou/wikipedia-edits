The club competes in [[EFL League One|League One]], the third tier of the English football league system, following promotion via the playoffs from [[EFL League Two|League Two]] in the 2017\u201318 season, and temporarily plays its home games at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St Andrew's Stadium]] in [[Birmingham]].\n\nCoventry City formed as Singers F.C. in 1883 following a general meeting of the Singer Factory Gentleman's club. They adopted their current name in 1898, joining the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1919. They won their only major trophy in 1987 when they beat [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 3\u20132 to win the [[FA Cup]].<ref name=\"Classic Cup Finals\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1987CoventryTottenham |title=Classic Cup Finals |publisher=[[The Football Association]] |accessdate=8 August 2008}}</ref> They are one of only five clubs to have won both the FA Cup and the [[FA Youth Cup]] in the same season. They have also reached two [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] semi-finals, in 1981 and 1990. They returned to Wembley in April 2017, defeating [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] 2\u20131 to win the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]] and again in May 2018, beating [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] 3\u20131 to gain promotion to EFL League One via the play-offs.\n\nThe club, nicknamed the Sky Blues because of the colour of their strip, was an inaugural member of the [[Premier League]] in 1992 and spent 34 consecutive seasons in the English top-flight until relegation in 2001. Following eleven seasons in the second-tier [[EFL Championship|Football League Championship]], Coventry were relegated to League One in 2012, the first time they had been in the third tier since 1964. In 2017, there was a further relegation, with the club dropping to the fourth tier of English football for the first time since 1959. They gained promotion back to League One the very next season.\n\nCoventry has qualified for European competitions twice. In the 1970\u201371 season, the team competed in the European [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] (now the [[UEFA Europa League]]), reaching the second round. Despite beating [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2\u20131 in the home leg, they had lost 1\u20136 in the first leg in Germany, and thus were eliminated. The team was unable to compete in the 1987\u201388 [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], due to the ban on English clubs at that time, following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster|Heysel disaster]].\n\nFrom 1899 to 2005, Coventry City played at [[Highfield Road]], which in 1981 became the first [[all-seater stadium]] in English football. In the late 1990s, the club's directors decided that a larger stadium was necessary, and so chose a site in the Rowley's Green area of the city. The 32,609-capacity [[Ricoh Arena]] was opened in August 2005 to replace Highfield Road. However, the club have left the Ricoh on two occasions and currently do not have an agreement to return.\n\n==History in brief==\n{{See also|History of Coventry City F.C.}}\n[[File:CoventryCityFC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of historic table positions of Coventry City in the Football League.]]\n* '''1883''' \u2013 The club is founded by employees of ''[[Singer Motors|Singer]]'', the cycle firm, with [[William Stanley (football manager)|William Stanley]] one of the leading lights.\n* '''1898''' \u2013 The club's name is changed from Singers F.C. to Coventry City.\n* '''1899''' \u2013 The club move to [[Highfield Road]] following stints at Dowells Field and Stoke Road.\n* '''1901''' \u2013 The club suffer their worst ever defeat with an 11\u20132 loss against Worcester-based Berwick Rangers in the qualifying round of the [[FA Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/coventry-city-fc/coventry-football-club-info/|title=Coventry City Football Club information|newspaper=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|accessdate=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902212305/http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/coventry-city-fc/coventry-football-club-info/|archive-date=2 September 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''1919''' \u2013 The club are voted into [[the Football League]], where they have remained ever since.\n* '''1928''' \u2013 In February, and with Coventry struggling near the foot of [[Division Three South]], the club's worst ever attendance is recorded.

kit==\n===Colours===\nCoventry's home shirts are either completely or predominately sky blue. However, in past seasons, different 'home colours' were worn. For example, in 1889, the then Singers FC wore pink and blue halved shirts (mirroring the corporate colours of Singers Motors). Furthermore, in the 1890s, black and red were the club's colours. In the early 1920s, the club wore red and green (to reflect the colours of the city crest). Sky blue was first used by Coventry in 1898 and the theme was used until 1922. Variations of blue and white were then used until the 1960s and the beginning of the 'sky blue revolution'. The colour made its return in 1962 thanks to the then manager, Jimmy Hill. To mark the 125th year of the club, Coventry wore a special brown shirt in the last home game of the 2008\u201309 season against Watford, having first worn a chocolate brown away kit in 1978. This kit has been cited by some as the worst in English football history, but also has an iconic status with some fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/transfer-news/coventrys-infamous-chocolate-brown-kit-4066416|title=Look: Coventry's infamous chocolate brown kit named as the worst strip in English football history|work=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=9 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608231120/http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/transfer-news/coventrys-infamous-chocolate-brown-kit-4066416|archive-date=8 June 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, in the [[2011\u201312 FA Cup#Third round proper|Third round]] [[FA Cup]] tie versus Southampton, the team wore a commemorative blue and white striped kit, marking the 25th anniversary of the club winning the FA Cup in [[1987 FA Cup Final|1987]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/07/coventry-city-southampton-fa-cup|title=Coventry fans protest as Southampton dump home side out of FA Cup|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=7 January 2012|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615035940/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/07/coventry-city-southampton-fa-cup|archive-date=15 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The strip was worn again in January 2013 for Coventry's [[2012\u201313 FA Cup#Third round proper|3rd round]] FA Cup fixture with Tottenham Hotspur, whom they beat in the 1987 final.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jan/04/coventry-tottenham-fa-cup-final-1987|title=Coventry head to Tottenham awash with memories of their finest hour|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Daniel|last=Taylor|date=4 January 2013|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615023647/http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jan/04/coventry-tottenham-fa-cup-final-1987|archive-date=15 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2019, Coventry City announced a new third kit in black and white honouring the city's connection with [[2 Tone Records]] on the 40th anniversary of the record label.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50027298|title=Coventry City to wear 2-Tone kit inspired by The Specials|date=12 October 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\n==Kit maker and sponsorship==\nSince the [[2019\u201320 EFL League One|2019\u201320]] season, the kit is made by [[Hummel International|Hummel]].

The ground had an interesting history. In 1940 the main stand which backed onto terraced houses in Mowbray Street was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]], heavy turnstiles from the ground and gas meters from houses in Mowbray Street were discovered in Gosford Park, some 500 metres away.\n\nThe record crowd at the ground was on 29 April 1967 when 51,455 watched the Second Division title decider against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. This was over 6,000 more than the previous record set against [[Aston Villa F.C|Aston Villa]] in 1938. Many people who were at that game suggest the attendance was a lot higher, possibly over 60,000. Supporters climbed onto the roofs of the stands and up the floodlights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1968, the main stand burnt down and its replacement was built within four months.\n\nIn 1981, Highfield Road was converted into England's first-ever [[all-seater stadium]] with a capacity of around 24,500, which many criticised as killing the atmosphere of the ground. Some seats were removed a few years later.<ref name=\"100yearshighfieldroad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/history/highfield-road-100-years.htm|title=100 Years of Highfield Road|work=cwn.org.uk|first=Jim|last=Brown|accessdate=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117064027/http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/history/highfield-road-100-years.htm|archive-date=17 January 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It had been gradually upgraded since then, with the final phase of work being completed in the mid-1990s, including two fully enclosed corners, providing some much-needed modernity.

The original plan was for a state-of-the-art, 45,000-seater multipurpose stadium with removable pitch and retractable roof. It was due to be ready for the 2001\u201302 season and was touted to be one of the finest and most advanced stadiums in Europe. However, the club's subsequent relegation, financial problems, financier/contractor withdrawals, and England's failure to secure the 2006 World Cup competition, led to a radical redesign. The resulting stadium was built to a standard bowl design with steep stands in line with several other new stadia built during that period. It has excellent acoustics and has been used to host several major rock concerts.\n\nDespite initiating the project and being the principal attraction there, Coventry City's financial situation means that it no longer owned the stadium and must pay rent to use it; this appeared to raise concerns over the managing of the club's finances by previous club officials, because in 2001 the club was the fourth-longest serving club in the top flight of English football. The stadium naming rights were originally sold to [[Jaguar Cars]], which has strong links with Coventry. Jaguar pulled out of the project on 16 December 2004 and a new major sponsor was needed. A \u00a310&nbsp;million deal, which included naming rights, was signed and electronics manufacturer [[Ricoh]] became the new chief sponsor for the stadium. The project was funded largely by [[Coventry City Council]] and the (Alan Edward) Higgs Charity (of which former CCFC and ACL director the late Sir [[Derek Higgs]] was a trustee), and includes shopping facilities, a casino, exhibition halls and a concert venue.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2005\u201306 season, construction delays at the ground forced Coventry City to play their first three games of the season away and postpone their home games. On Saturday 20 August 2005, City hosted [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the first-ever game at the Ricoh Arena; Coventry won the game 3\u20130. On 28 July 2011, a statue of [[Jimmy Hill]] was installed at the main entrance to the Ricoh Arena, with Hill appearing in person to unveil it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-14328753|title=Jimmy Hill statue unveiled at Coventry's Ricoh Arena|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=24 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530095519/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-14328753|archive-date=30 May 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===2013 rent row and ground relocation===\n[[File:Sixfieldsstadium.JPG|thumb|Rent disputes caused Coventry City to play the 2013\u201314 season at [[Sixfields Stadium]] in [[Northampton]]]]\nOn 3 May 2013, Coventry City put a contingency plan in place to play elsewhere for the 2013\u201314 season. It was argued by the club that this was due to ACL (Arena Coventry Limited), which managed the stadium, being unwilling to negotiate with the club to agree to a new lease. However, that led to the local newspaper, the ''[[Coventry Telegraph]]'', starting a petition to stop Coventry City from playing outside of Coventry. It was sent to all 72 clubs in the Football League and also the Football League chairman.

Midlands (county)|West Midlands]], England. The club competes in [[EFL League One|League One]], the third tier of the English football league system, following promotion via the playoffs from [[EFL League Two|League Two]] in the 2017\u201318 season, and temporarily plays its home games at [[St Andrew's (stadium)|St Andrew's Stadium]] in [[Birmingham]].\n\nCoventry City formed as Singers F.C. in 1883 following a general meeting of the Singer Factory Gentleman's club. They adopted their current name in 1898, joining the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1919. They won their only major trophy in 1987 when they beat [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 3\u20132 to win the [[FA Cup]].<ref name=\"Classic Cup Finals\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1987CoventryTottenham |title=Classic Cup Finals |publisher=[[The Football Association]] |accessdate=8 August 2008}}</ref> They are one of only five clubs to have won both the FA Cup and the [[FA Youth Cup]] in the same season. They have also reached two [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] semi-finals, in 1981 and 1990. They returned to Wembley in April 2017, defeating [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]] 2\u20131 to win the [[EFL Trophy|Football League Trophy]] and again in May 2018, beating [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] 3\u20131 to gain promotion to EFL League One via the play-offs.\n\nThe club, nicknamed the Sky Blues because of the colour of their strip, was an inaugural member of the [[Premier League]] in 1992 and spent 34 consecutive seasons in the English top-flight until relegation in 2001. Following eleven seasons in the second-tier [[EFL Championship|Football League Championship]], Coventry were relegated to League One in 2012, the first time they had been in the third tier since 1964. In 2017, there was a further relegation, with the club dropping to the fourth tier of English football for the first time since 1959. They gained promotion back to League One the very next season.\n\nCoventry has qualified for European competitions twice. In the 1970\u201371 season, the team competed in the European [[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]] (now the [[UEFA Europa League]]), reaching the second round. Despite beating [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] 2\u20131 in the home leg, they had lost 1\u20136 in the first leg in Germany, and thus were eliminated. The team was unable to compete in the 1987\u201388 [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]], due to the ban on English clubs at that time, following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster|Heysel disaster]].\n\nFrom 1899 to 2005, Coventry City played at [[Highfield Road]], which in 1981 became the first [[all-seater stadium]] in English football. In the late 1990s, the club's directors decided that a larger stadium was necessary, and so chose a site in the Rowley's Green area of the city. The 32,609-capacity [[Ricoh Arena]] was opened in August 2005 to replace Highfield Road. However, the club have left the Ricoh on two occasions and currently do not have an agreement to return.\n\n==History in brief==\n{{See also|History of Coventry City F.C.}}\n[[File:CoventryCityFC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of historic table positions of Coventry City in the Football League.]]\n* '''1883''' \u2013 The club is founded by employees of ''[[Singer Motors|Singer]]'', the cycle firm, with [[William Stanley (football manager)|William Stanley]] one of the leading lights.\n* '''1898''' \u2013 The club's name is changed from Singers F.C. to Coventry City.\n* '''1899''' \u2013 The club move to [[Highfield Road]] following stints at Dowells Field and Stoke Road.\n* '''1901''' \u2013 The club suffer their worst ever defeat with an 11\u20132 loss against Worcester-based Berwick Rangers in the qualifying round of the [[FA Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/coventry-city-fc/coventry-football-club-info/|title=Coventry City Football Club information|newspaper=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|accessdate=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120902212305/http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/coventry-city-fc/coventry-football-club-info/|archive-date=2 September 2012|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* '''1919''' \u2013 The club are voted into [[the Football League]], where they have remained ever since.\n* '''1928''' \u2013 In February, and with Coventry struggling near the foot of [[Division Three South]], the club's worst ever attendance is recorded.

kit==\n===Colours===\nCoventry's home shirts are either completely or predominately sky blue. However, in past seasons, different 'home colours' were worn. For example, in 1889, the then Singers FC wore pink and blue halved shirts (mirroring the corporate colours of Singers Motors). Furthermore, in the 1890s, black and red were the club's colours. In the early 1920s, the club wore red and green (to reflect the colours of the city crest). Sky blue was first used by Coventry in 1898 and the theme was used until 1922. Variations of blue and white were then used until the 1960s and the beginning of the 'sky blue revolution'. The colour made its return in 1962 thanks to the then manager, Jimmy Hill. To mark the 125th year of the club, Coventry wore a special brown shirt in the last home game of the 2008\u201309 season against Watford, having first worn a chocolate brown away kit in 1978. This kit has been cited by some as the worst in English football history, but also has an iconic status with some fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/transfer-news/coventrys-infamous-chocolate-brown-kit-4066416|title=Look: Coventry's infamous chocolate brown kit named as the worst strip in English football history|work=[[Coventry Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=9 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608231120/http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/sport/football/transfer-news/coventrys-infamous-chocolate-brown-kit-4066416|archive-date=8 June 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, in the [[2011\u201312 FA Cup#Third round proper|Third round]] [[FA Cup]] tie versus Southampton, the team wore a commemorative blue and white striped kit, marking the 25th anniversary of the club winning the FA Cup in [[1987 FA Cup Final|1987]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/07/coventry-city-southampton-fa-cup|title=Coventry fans protest as Southampton dump home side out of FA Cup|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=7 January 2012|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615035940/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/07/coventry-city-southampton-fa-cup|archive-date=15 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The strip was worn again in January 2013 for Coventry's [[2012\u201313 FA Cup#Third round proper|3rd round]] FA Cup fixture with Tottenham Hotspur, whom they beat in the 1987 final.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jan/04/coventry-tottenham-fa-cup-final-1987|title=Coventry head to Tottenham awash with memories of their finest hour|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|first=Daniel|last=Taylor|date=4 January 2013|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615023647/http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/jan/04/coventry-tottenham-fa-cup-final-1987|archive-date=15 June 2015|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2019, Coventry City announced a new third kit in black and white honouring the city's connection with [[2 Tone Records]] on the 40th anniversary of the record label.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50027298|title=Coventry City to wear 2-Tone kit inspired by The Specials|date=12 October 2019|via=www.bbc.co.uk|work=BBC Sport}}</ref>\n\n==Kit maker and sponsorship==\nSince the [[2019\u201320 EFL League One|2019\u201320]] season, the kit is made by [[Hummel International|Hummel]].

The ground had an interesting history. In 1940 the main stand which backed onto terraced houses in Mowbray Street was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]], heavy turnstiles from the ground and gas meters from houses in Mowbray Street were discovered in Gosford Park, some 500 metres away.\n\nThe record crowd at the ground was on 29 April 1967 when 51,455 watched the Second Division title decider against [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. This was over 6,000 more than the previous record set against [[Aston Villa F.C|Aston Villa]] in 1938. Many people who were at that game suggest the attendance was a lot higher, possibly over 60,000. Supporters climbed onto the roofs of the stands and up the floodlights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn 1968, the main stand burnt down and its replacement was built within four months.\n\nIn 1981, Highfield Road was converted into England's first-ever [[all-seater stadium]] with a capacity of around 24,500, which many criticised as killing the atmosphere of the ground. Some seats were removed a few years later.<ref name=\"100yearshighfieldroad\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/history/highfield-road-100-years.htm|title=100 Years of Highfield Road|work=cwn.org.uk|first=Jim|last=Brown|accessdate=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117064027/http://www.cwn.org.uk/skyblues/history/highfield-road-100-years.htm|archive-date=17 January 2013|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It had been gradually upgraded since then, with the final phase of work being completed in the mid-1990s, including two fully enclosed corners, providing some much-needed modernity.

The original plan was for a state-of-the-art, 45,000-seater multipurpose stadium with removable pitch and retractable roof. It was due to be ready for the 2001\u201302 season and was touted to be one of the finest and most advanced stadiums in Europe. However, the club's subsequent relegation, financial problems, financier/contractor withdrawals, and England's failure to secure the 2006 World Cup competition, led to a radical redesign. The resulting stadium was built to a standard bowl design with steep stands in line with several other new stadia built during that period. It has excellent acoustics and has been used to host several major rock concerts.\n\nDespite initiating the project and being the principal attraction there, Coventry City's financial situation means that it no longer owned the stadium and must pay rent to use it; this appeared to raise concerns over the managing of the club's finances by previous club officials, because in 2001 the club was the fourth-longest serving club in the top flight of English football. The stadium naming rights were originally sold to [[Jaguar Cars]], which has strong links with Coventry. Jaguar pulled out of the project on 16 December 2004 and a new major sponsor was needed. A \u00a310&nbsp;million deal, which included naming rights, was signed and electronics manufacturer [[Ricoh]] became the new chief sponsor for the stadium. The project was funded largely by [[Coventry City Council]] and the (Alan Edward) Higgs Charity (of which former CCFC and ACL director the late Sir [[Derek Higgs]] was a trustee), and includes shopping facilities, a casino, exhibition halls and a concert venue.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2005\u201306 season, construction delays at the ground forced Coventry City to play their first three games of the season away and postpone their home games. On Saturday 20 August 2005, City hosted [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in the first-ever game at the Ricoh Arena; Coventry won the game 3\u20130. On 28 July 2011, a statue of [[Jimmy Hill]] was installed at the main entrance to the Ricoh Arena, with Hill appearing in person to unveil it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-14328753|title=Jimmy Hill statue unveiled at Coventry's Ricoh Arena|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|date=28 July 2011|accessdate=24 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530095519/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-14328753|archive-date=30 May 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===2013 rent row and ground relocation===\n[[File:Sixfieldsstadium.JPG|thumb|Rent disputes caused Coventry City to play the 2013\u201314 season at [[Sixfields Stadium]] in [[Northampton]]]]\nOn 3 May 2013, Coventry City put a contingency plan in place to play elsewhere for the 2013\u201314 season. It was argued by the club that this was due to ACL (Arena Coventry Limited), which managed the stadium, being unwilling to negotiate with the club to agree to a new lease. However, that led to the local newspaper, the ''[[Coventry Telegraph]]'', starting a petition to stop Coventry City from playing outside of Coventry. It was sent to all 72 clubs in the Football League and also the Football League chairman.

The greatest English poet of the [[Middle Ages]], he is best known for ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', and is considered the \"Father of English literature\". He was the first writer buried in [[Poets' Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>Robert DeMaria, Jr., Heesok Chang, Samantha Zacher, eds, ''A Companion to British Literature, Volume 2: Early Modern Literature, 1450\u20131660'', John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 41.</ref> Chaucer also gained fame as a philosopher and [[astronomer]], composing the scientific ''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' for his 10-year-old son Lewis. He maintained a career in the civil service as a [[bureaucrat]], [[courtier]], diplomat, and member of parliament. \n\nAmong Chaucer's many other works are ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''. He is seen as crucial in legitimising the literary use of [[Middle English]] when the dominant literary languages in England were still [[French language|French]] and [[Latin]].\n\n==Origin==\n[[File:Chaucer ellesmere.jpg|thumb|Chaucer as a pilgrim from the [[Ellesmere manuscript]]]]\nChaucer was born in London most likely in the early 1340s, though the precise date and location remain unknown.

''The Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1899; Vol. I, pp. xi\u2013xii.</ref>\n\nJohn Chaucer married Agnes Copton, who inherited properties in 1349, including 24 shops in London from her uncle Hamo de Copton, who is described in a will dated 3 April 1354 and listed in the City Hustings Roll as \"moneyer\", said to be moneyer at the [[Tower of London]]. In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Chaucer refers to himself as ''me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie'', which translates as: \"Geoffrey Chaucer, son of John Chaucer, vintners, London\".\n\n==Career==\nWhile records concerning the lives of his contemporaries, [[William Langland]] and the [[Pearl Poet]], are practically non-existent, since Chaucer was a public servant, his official life is very well documented, with nearly five hundred written items testifying to his career. The first of the \"Chaucer Life Records\" appears in 1357, in the household accounts of [[Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster|Elizabeth de Burgh]], the [[Earl of Ulster|Countess of Ulster]], when he became the noblewoman's page through his father's connections,<ref>Skeat (1899); Vol. I, p. xvii.</ref> a common medieval form of apprenticeship for boys into knighthood or prestige appointments. The countess was married to [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel, Duke of Clarence]], the second surviving son of the king, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and the position brought the teenage Chaucer into the close court circle, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He also worked as a courtier, a diplomat, and a civil servant, as well as working for the king from 1389 to 1391 as Clerk of the King's Works.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Critical Companion to Chaucer: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work |last1=Rossignol |first1=Rosalyn |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |pages=551, 613 |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-8160-6193-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1359, in the early stages of the [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] invaded France and Chaucer travelled with [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], Elizabeth's husband, as part of the [[History of the British Army|English army]]. In 1360, he was captured during the [[Reims Campaign|siege of Rheims]]. Edward paid \u00a316 for his ransom,<ref>''Chaucer Life Records'', p. 24.</ref> a considerable sum {{Inflation|UK|value=16|start_year=1360|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}},{{Inflation/fn|UK}} and Chaucer was released.\n\n[[File:ChaucerCrest EwelmeChurch Oxfordshire.png|thumb|Chaucer crest ''A unicorn's head'' with [[canting arms]] of Roet below: ''Gules, three Catherine Wheels or'' (French ''rouet'' = \"spinning wheel\").

Around 1366, Chaucer married [[Philippa (de) Roet]]. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III's queen, [[Philippa of Hainault]], and a sister of [[Katherine Swynford]], who later (c. 1396) became the third wife of [[John of Gaunt]]. It is uncertain how many children Chaucer and Philippa had, but three or four are most commonly cited. His son, [[Thomas Chaucer]], had an illustrious career, as [[Chief Butler of England|chief butler]] to four kings, envoy to France, and [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. Thomas's daughter, [[Alice de la Pole|Alice]], married the [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]].

He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a ''[[valet de chambre]]'', [[yeoman]], or [[esquire]] on 20 June 1367, a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. His wife also received a pension for court employment. He travelled abroad many times, at least some of them in his role as a valet. In 1368, he may have attended the wedding of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]] to [[Violante Visconti]], daughter of [[Galeazzo II Visconti]], in [[Milan]]. Two other literary stars of the era were in attendance: [[Jean Froissart]] and [[Petrarch]]. Around this time, Chaucer is believed to have written ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' in honour of [[Blanche of Lancaster]], the late wife of John of Gaunt, who died in 1369 of the plague.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Holt Literature and Language Arts |last= |first= |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |year=2003 |isbn=978-0030573743 |location= |pages=113}}</ref>\n\nChaucer travelled to [[Picardy]] the next year as part of a military expedition; in 1373 he visited [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]].

Later documents suggest it was a mission, along with Jean Froissart, to arrange a marriage between the future King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and a French princess, thereby ending the [[Hundred Years War]]. If this was the purpose of their trip, they seem to have been unsuccessful, as no wedding occurred.\n\nIn 1378, Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy (secret dispatch) to the Visconti and to Sir [[John Hawkwood]], English [[condottiere]] (mercenary leader) in [[Milan]]. It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character the Knight in the ''Canterbury Tales'', for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere.\n\n[[File:Geoffrey Chaucer.jpeg|left|thumb|A 19th-century depiction of Chaucer]]\nA possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] granted Chaucer \"a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life\" for some unspecified task. This was an unusual grant, but given on a day of celebration, [[St George's Day]], 1374, when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded, it is assumed to have been another early poetic work. It is not known which, if any, of Chaucer's extant works prompted the reward, but the suggestion of him as poet to a king places him as a precursor to later [[poets laureate]]. Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power, after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18 April 1378.\n\nChaucer obtained the very substantial job of [[comptroller]] of the customs for the port of London, which he began on 8 June 1374.<ref>Morley, Henry (1890) ''English Writers: an attempt towards a history of English literature''.

His life goes undocumented for much of the next ten years, but it is believed that he wrote (or began) most of his famous works during this period.

He is thought to have started work on ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the early 1380s. He also became a member of parliament for Kent in 1386, and attended the '[[Wonderful Parliament]]' that year.

The phrase \"long castel\" is a reference to Lancaster (also called \"Loncastel\" and \"Longcastell\"), \"walles white\" is thought to be an oblique reference to Blanche, \"Seynt Johan\" was John of Gaunt's name-saint, and \"ryche hil\" is a reference to Richmond. These references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. \"White\" is the English translation of the French word \"blanche\", implying that the white lady was [[Blanche of Lancaster]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Riverside Chaucer |last1=Wilcockson |first1=Colin |editor1-last=Benson |editor1-first=Larry D. |editor2-last=Pratt |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Robinson |editor3-first=F.

''Fortune'', in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes that she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, \"And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve\" (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts, \"My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse\" (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. ''Fortune'' turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and \"Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne\" (78\u201379). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|York]], and [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]], and a portion of line 76 (\"as three of you or tweyne\") is thought to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes.<ref name=\"Gross, Zaila 1987 635\" /> Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's \"beste frend\". ''Fortune'' states three times in her response to the plaintiff, \"And also, you still have your best friend alive\" (32, 40, 48); she also refers to his \"beste frend\" in the envoy when appealing to his \"noblesse\" to help Chaucer to a higher estate. The narrator makes a fifth reference when he rails at ''Fortune'' that she shall not take his friend from him.\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nChaucer's attitudes toward the Church should not be confused with his attitudes toward Christianity.

B. McCully and J. J. Anderson, ''English Historical Metrics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 97.</ref> Chaucer is known for metrical innovation, inventing the [[rhyme royal]], and he was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line, a decasyllabic cousin to the [[iambic pentameter]], in his work, with only a few anonymous short works using it before him.<ref>[[Marchette Chute]], ''Geoffrey Chaucer of England'' E. P. Dutton, 1946, p. 89.</ref> The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming [[couplet]]s, first seen in his ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', was used in much of his later work and became one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early influence as a satirist is also important, with the common humorous device, the funny accent of a regional [[dialect]], apparently making its first appearance in ''[[The Reeve's Tale]]''.\n\nThe poetry of Chaucer, along with other writers of the era, is credited with helping to standardise the London Dialect of the [[Middle English]] language from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects.<ref>Edwin Winfield Bowen, ''Questions at Issue in our English Speech'', NY: Broadway Publishing, 1909, p. 147.</ref> This is probably overstated; the influence of the court, [[Lord Chancellor|chancery]] and bureaucracy \u2013 of which Chaucer was a part \u2013 remains a more probable influence on the development of [[Standard English]]. [[Modern English]] is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer's poems owing to the effect of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] some time after his death. This change in the [[pronunciation]] of English, still not fully understood, makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for the modern audience. The status of the final ''-e'' in Chaucer's verse is uncertain: it seems likely that during the period of Chaucer's writing the final ''-e'' was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. Chaucer's versification suggests that the final ''-e'' is sometimes to be vocalised, and sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is disagreement. When it is vocalised, most scholars pronounce it as a [[schwa]]. Apart from the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader. Chaucer is also recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as the first author to use many common English words in his writings. These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time but Chaucer, with his ear for common speech, is the earliest extant manuscript source. ''Acceptable'', ''alkali'', ''altercation'', ''amble'', ''angrily'', ''annex'', ''annoyance'', ''approaching'', ''arbitration'', ''armless'', ''army'', ''arrogant'', ''arsenic'', ''arc'', ''artillery'' and ''aspect'' are just some of the many [[English words first attested in Chaucer]].\n\n===Literary===\nWidespread knowledge of Chaucer's works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing. [[John Lydgate]] was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucer's unfinished ''Tales'' while [[Robert Henryson]]'s ''Testament of Cresseid'' completes the story of [[Cressida]] left unfinished in his ''Troilus and Criseyde''. Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works contain material from these poets and later appreciations by the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later \"additions\" from original Chaucer. Writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as [[John Dryden]], admired Chaucer for his stories, but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess.<ref>\"From The Preface to ''Fables Ancient and Modern''\". ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''. Stephen Greenblatt. 8th ed. Vol. C. New York, London: Norton, 2006. 2132\u201333. p. 2132.</ref> It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided upon, largely as a result of [[Walter William Skeat]]'s work. Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer's death, ''The Canterbury Tales'' was selected by [[William Caxton]] to be one of the first books to be printed in England.\n\n===English===\nChaucer is sometimes considered the source of the English vernacular tradition. His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of a [[vernacular literature]], after the example of [[Dante]], in many parts of Europe. A parallel trend in Chaucer's own lifetime was underway in Scotland through the work of his slightly earlier contemporary, [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]], and was likely to have been even more general, as is evidenced by the example of the [[Pearl Poet]] in the north of England.\n\nAlthough Chaucer's language is much closer to Modern English than the text of ''[[Beowulf]]'', such that (unlike that of ''Beowulf'') a Modern English-speaker with a large vocabulary of archaic words may understand it, it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom. The following is a sample from the prologue of ''[[The Summoner's Tale]]'' that compares Chaucer's text to a modern translation:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"4\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n| || ''Original Text'' || ''Modern Translation''\n|-\n| || This frere bosteth that he knoweth helle,\n| This friar boasts that he knows hell,\n|-\n| || And God it woot, that it is litel wonder;\n| And God knows that it is little wonder;\n|-\n| || Freres and feendes been but lyte asonder.\n| Friars and fiends are seldom far apart.\n|-\n| || For, pardee, ye han ofte tyme herd telle\n| For, by God, you have ofttimes heard tell\n|-\n|  || How that a frere ravyshed was to helle\n| How a friar was taken to hell\n|-\n| || In spirit ones by a visioun;\n| In spirit, once by a vision;\n|-\n| || And as an angel ladde hym up and doun,\n| And as an angel led him up and down,\n|-\n|  || To shewen hym the peynes that the were,\n| To show him the pains that were there,\n|-\n| || In al the place saugh he nat a frere;\n| In all the place he saw not a friar;\n|-\n| || Of oother folk he saugh ynowe in wo.\n| Of other folk he saw enough in woe.\n|-\n|  || Unto this angel spak the frere tho:\n| Unto this angel spoke the friar thus:\n|-\n| || Now, sire, quod he, han freres swich a grace     \n| \"Now sir\", said he, \"Have friars such a grace\n|-\n| || That noon of hem shal come to this place?\n| That none of them come to this place?\"\n|-\n| || Yis, quod this aungel, many a millioun!\n| \"Yes\", said the angel, \"many a million!\"\n|-\n| || And unto sathanas he ladde hym doun.\n| And unto Satan the angel led him down.\n|-\n| || \u2013And now hath sathanas, \u2013seith he, \u2013a tayl\n| \"And now Satan has\", he said, \"a tail,\n|-\n|  || Brodder than of a carryk is the sayl.\n| Broader than a galleon's sail.\n|-\n| || Hold up thy tayl, thou sathanas!\u2013quod he;\n| Hold up your tail, Satan!\" said he.\n|-\n| || \u2013shewe forth thyn ers, and lat the frere se\n| \"Show forth your arse, and let the friar see\n|-\n| || Where is the nest of freres in this place!\u2013\n| Where the nest of friars is in this place!\"\n|-\n| || And er that half a furlong wey of space,\n| And before half a furlong of space,\n|-\n| || Right so as bees out swarmen from an hyve,    \n| Just as bees swarm out from a hive,\n|-\n| ||Out of the develes ers ther gonne dryve\n| Out of the devil's arse there were driven\n|-\n| || Twenty thousand freres on a route,\n| Twenty thousand friars on a rout,\n|-\n| || And thurghout helle swarmed al aboute,\n| And throughout hell swarmed all about,\n|-\n| || And comen agayn as faste as they may gon,    \n| And came again as fast as they could go,\n|-\n| || And in his ers they crepten everychon.\n| And every one crept into his arse.\n|-\n|  ||He clapte his tayl agayn and lay ful stille.\n| He shut his tail again and lay very still.<ref>Original e-text available online at the [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Cha2Can.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&tag=public&part=17&division=div2 University of Virginia website], trans.

There are 83 surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales (in whole or part) alone, along with sixteen of ''Troilus and Criseyde'', including the personal copy of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].<ref>Benson, Larry, ''The Riverside Chaucer'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987), p. 1118.</ref> Given the ravages of time, it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost. Chaucer's original audience was a courtly one, and would have included women as well as men of the upper social classes. Yet even before his death in 1400, Chaucer's audience had begun to include members of the rising literate, middle and merchant classes, which included many [[Lollard]] sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own, particularly in his satirical writings about friars, priests, and other church officials. In 1464, John Baron, a tenant farmer in Agmondesham ([[Amersham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]), was brought before [[John Chadworth]], the Bishop of Lincoln, on charges of being a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a \"boke of the Tales of Caunterburie\" among other suspect volumes.<ref>Potter, Russell A., \"Chaucer and the Authority of Language: The Politics and Poetics of the Vernacular in Late Medieval England\", ''Assays'' VI (Carnegie-Mellon Press, 1991), p. 91.</ref>\n\n===Printed editions===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[William Caxton]], the first English printer, was responsible for the first two [[folio]] editions of ''The Canterbury Tales'' which were published in 1478 and 1483.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm |title=A Leaf from The Canterbury Tales | location=Westminster, England \n| publisher=William Caxton | year=1473 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031075730/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm |archivedate=31 October 2005}}</ref> Caxton's second printing, by his own account, came about because a customer complained that the printed text differed from a manuscript he knew; Caxton obligingly used the man's manuscript as his source. Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority. Caxton's edition was reprinted by his successor, [[Wynkyn de Worde]], but this edition has no independent authority.\n \n[[Richard Pynson]], the [[King's Printer]] under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer; however, in the process, he introduced five previously printed texts that are now known not to be Chaucer's. (The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume.) There is a likely connection between Pynson's product and [[William Thynne]]'s a mere six years later. Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546, as chief clerk of the kitchen of Henry VIII, one of the masters of the royal household. He spent years comparing various versions of Chaucer's works, and selected 41 pieces for publication. While there were questions over the authorship of some of the material, there is not doubt this was the first comprehensive view of Chaucer's work. ''The Workes of Geffray Chaucer,'' published in 1532, was the first edition of Chaucer's collected works. His editions of ''Chaucer's Works'' in 1532 and 1542 were the first major contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]. Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king who is praised in the preface by [[Sir Brian Tuke]]. Thynne's canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28, even if that was not his intention.<ref name=Stow1561 /> As with Pynson, once included in the ''Works'', [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]] texts stayed with those works, regardless of their first editor's intentions.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Chaucer was printed more than any other English author, and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer [[wikt:canon|canon]] began to cohere. Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucer's ''Works'' set the precedent for all other English authors in terms of presentation, prestige and success in print. These editions certainly established Chaucer's reputation, but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucer's biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him.\n\nProbably the most significant aspect of the growing [[apocrypha]] is that, beginning with Thynne's editions, it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] [[Lollard]], primarily the ''[[Testament of Love]]'' and ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]''. As \"Chaucerian\" works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century, these medieval texts enjoyed a new life, with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympathetic\u2014or malleable enough to be construed as sympathetic\u2014to their cause. The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his ''Works'' was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done, concurrently, with [[William Langland]] and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''.\n\nThe famous ''Plowman's Tale'' did not enter Thynne's ''Works'' until the second, 1542, edition. Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynne's inclusion of [[Thomas Usk]]'s ''Testament of Love'' in the first edition. The ''Testament of Love'' imitates, borrows from, and thus resembles Usk's contemporary, Chaucer. (''Testament of Love'' also appears to borrow from ''Piers Plowman''.) Since the ''Testament of Love'' mentions its author's part in a failed plot (book 1, chapter 6), his imprisonment, and (perhaps) a recantation of (possibly Lollard) heresy, all this was associated with Chaucer. (Usk himself was executed as a traitor in 1388.) [[John Foxe]] took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith, calling Chaucer a \"right Wiclevian\" and (erroneously) identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of [[John Wycliffe]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]]. ([[Thomas Speght]] is careful to highlight these facts in his editions and his \"Life of Chaucer\".) No other sources for the ''Testament of Love'' exist\u2014there is only Thynne's construction of whatever manuscript sources he had.\n\n[[John Stow]] (1525\u20131605) was an antiquarian and also a chronicler. His edition of Chaucer's ''Works'' in 1561<ref name=Stow1561>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm |title=UWM.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111220719/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm |archivedate=11 November 2005}}</ref> brought the apocrypha to more than 50 titles. More were added in the 17th century, and they remained as late as 1810, well after [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] pared the canon down in his 1775 edition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg079.htm |title=The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer: To Which are Added an Essay on his Language and Versification, and an Introductory Discourse, Together with Notes and a Glossary by the late Thomas Tyrwhitt.

What was added to Chaucer often helped represent him favourably to Protestant England.\n\n[[File:Chaucer 1602.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Chaucer from [[Thomas Speght|Speght's]] edition. The two top shields display: ''Per pale argent and gules, a bend counterchanged'' (Chaucer), that at bottom left: ''Gules, three [[Breaking wheel|Catherine Wheels]] or'' (Roet, [[canting arms]], French ''rouet'' = \"spinning wheel\"), and that at bottom right displays Roet quartering ''Argent, a chief gules overall a lion rampant double queued or'' (Chaucer) with crest of Chaucer above: ''A unicorn head'']]\n\nIn his 1598 edition of the ''Works'', Speght (probably taking cues from Foxe) made good use of Usk's account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the ''Testament of Love'' to assemble a largely fictional \"Life of Our Learned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer\". Speght's \"Life\" presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own, a proto-Protestant who eventually came round to the king's views on religion. Speght states, \"In the second year of Richard the second, the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection. The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people.\" Under the discussion of Chaucer's friends, namely John of Gaunt, Speght further explains:\n\n::Yet it seemeth that [Chaucer] was in some trouble in the daies of King Richard the second, as it may appeare in the Testament of Loue: where hee doth greatly complaine of his owne rashnesse in following the multitude, and of their hatred against him for bewraying their purpose. And in that complaint which he maketh to his empty purse, I do find a written copy, which I had of Iohn Stow (whose library hath helped many writers) wherein ten times more is adioined, then is in print. Where he maketh great lamentation for his wrongfull imprisonment, wishing death to end his daies: which in my iudgement doth greatly accord with that in the Testament of Loue. Moreouer we find it thus in Record.\n\nLater, in \"The [[Argument (literature)|Argument]]\" to the ''Testament of Love'', Speght adds:\n::Chaucer did compile this booke as a comfort to himselfe after great griefs conceiued for some rash attempts of the commons, with whome he had ioyned, and thereby was in feare to loose the fauour of his best friends.\n\nSpeght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] in [[Fleet Street]], as well as a fictitious [[coat of arms]] and [[family tree]]. Ironically \u2013 and perhaps consciously so \u2013 an introductory, apologetic letter in Speght's edition from [[Francis Beaumont]] defends the unseemly, \"low\", and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite, classicist position. Francis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his ''Animadversions'', insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner, and he objected to the friar-beating story. Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucer's support for popular religious reform, associating Chaucer's views with his father William Thynne's attempts to include ''The Plowman's Tale'' and ''The Pilgrim's Tale'' in the 1532 and 1542 ''Works''.\n\nThe myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucerian scholarship. Though it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that did not exist until more than a century after his death, the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism. This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucer's works, including neo-Marxism.\n\nAlongside Chaucer's ''Works'', the most impressive literary monument of the period is [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Acts and Monuments...]]''. As with the Chaucer editions, it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project. Foxe's Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucer's ''Works'', particularly the pseudepigrapha. ''Jack Upland'' was first printed in Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', and then it appeared in Speght's edition of Chaucer's ''Works''. Speght's \"Life of Chaucer\" echoes Foxe's own account, which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the ''Testament of Love'' and ''The Plowman's Tale'' to their pages. Like Speght's Chaucer, Foxe's Chaucer was also a shrewd (or lucky) political survivor. In his 1563 edition, Foxe \"thought it not out of season \u2026 to couple \u2026 some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer\" with a discussion of [[John Colet]], a possible source for [[John Skelton]]'s character [[Colin Clout]].\n\nProbably referring to the 1542 [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]], Foxe said that he \"marvel[s] to consider \u2026 how the bishops, condemning and abolishing all manner of English books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge, did yet authorise the works of Chaucer to remain still and to be occupied; who, no doubt, saw into religion as much almost as even we do now, and uttereth in his works no less, and seemeth to be a right Wicklevian, or else there never was any. And that, all his works almost, if they be thoroughly advised, will testify (albeit done in mirth, and covertly); and especially the latter end of his third book of the Testament of Love \u2026 Wherein, except a man be altogether blind, he may espy him at the full: although in the same book (as in all others he useth to do), under shadows covertly, as under a visor, he suborneth truth in such sort, as both privily she may profit the godly-minded, and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary. And therefore the bishops, belike, taking his works but for jests and toys, in condemning other books, yet permitted his books to be read.\"\n\nIt is significant, too, that Foxe's discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of \"The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther\" when \"Printing, being opened, incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors, which before lay hid and unknown. The science of printing being found, immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment: by which light darkness began to be espied, and ignorance to be detected; truth from error, religion from superstition, to be discerned.\"\n\nFoxe downplays Chaucer's bawdy and amorous writing, insisting that it all testifies to his piety. Material that is troubling is deemed metaphoric, while the more forthright satire (which Foxe prefers) is taken literally.\n[[File:Chaucer1721.jpg|thumb|left|Spine and Titlepage of the 1721 [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry edition]] of Chaucer's complete works]]\n\n[[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]] produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font, published posthumously in 1721. Included were several tales, according to the editors, for the first time printed, a biography of Chaucer, a glossary of old English words, and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century. According to A. S. G Edwards, \"This was the first collected edition of Chaucer to be printed in roman type. The life of Chaucer prefixed to the volume was the work of the Reverend [[John Dart]], corrected and revised by Timothy Thomas. The glossary appended was also mainly compiled by Thomas. The text of Urry's edition has often been criticised by subsequent editors for its frequent conjectural emendations, mainly to make it conform to his sense of Chaucer's metre. The justice of such criticisms should not obscure his achievement. His is the first edition of Chaucer for nearly a hundred and fifty years to consult any manuscripts and is the first since that of William Thynne in 1534 to seek systematically to assemble a substantial number of manuscripts to establish his text. It is also the first edition to offer descriptions of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works, and the first to print texts of 'Gamelyn' and 'The Tale of Beryn', works ascribed to, but not by, Chaucer.\"\n\n===Modern scholarship===\nAlthough Chaucer's works had long been admired, serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century, when [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] edited ''The Canterbury Tales'', and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chaucer: The Critical Heritage.

[[Walter William Skeat]], who like Furnivall was closely associated with the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', established the base text of all of Chaucer's works with his edition, published by Oxford University Press. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements, along with critical commentary and bibliographies.\n\nWith the textual issues largely addressed, if not resolved, attention turned to the questions of Chaucer's themes, structure, and audience. The ''Chaucer Review'' was founded in 1966 and has maintained its position as the pre-eminent journal of Chaucer studies.\n\n==List of works==\nThe following major works are in rough chronological order but scholars still debate the dating of most of Chaucer's output and works made up from a collection of stories may have been compiled over a long period.\n\n===Major works===\n*Translation of ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', possibly extant as ''[[The Romaunt of the Rose]]''\n*''[[The Book of the Duchess]]''\n*''[[The House of Fame]]''\n*''[[Anelida and Arcite]]''\n*''[[Parlement of Foules]]''\n*Translation of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' as ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''\n*''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''\n*''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''\n*''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''\n*''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]''\n\n===Short poems===\n[[File:Balade to Rosemounde.jpg|thumb|''Balade to Rosemounde'']]\n*''An ABC''\n*''Chaucers Wordes unto Adam, His Owne Scriveyn'' (disputed)<ref>Weiskott, Eric. \"''Adam Scriveyn'' and Chaucer's Metrical Practice.\" ''Medium \u00c6vum'' 86 (2017): 147\u201351.</ref>\n*''The Complaint unto Pity''\n*''The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse''\n*''[[The Complaint of Mars]]''\n*''The Complaint of Venus''\n*''A Complaint to His Lady''\n*''The Former Age''\n*''Fortune''\n*''Gentilesse''\n*''Lak of Stedfastnesse''\n*''Lenvoy de Chaucer a Scogan''\n*''Lenvoy de Chaucer a Bukton''\n*''Proverbs''\n*''Balade to Rosemounde''\n*''Truth''\n*''Womanly Noblesse''\n\n===Poems of doubtful authorship===\n*''Against Women Unconstant''\n*''A Balade of Complaint''\n*''Complaynt D'Amours''\n*''Merciles Beaute''\n*''The Equatorie of the Planets''&nbsp;\u2013 A rough translation of a Latin work derived from an Arab work of the same title.

The similar ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'', not usually doubted as Chaucer's work, in addition to Chaucer's name as a gloss to the manuscript are the main pieces of evidence for the ascription to Chaucer.

The greatest English poet of the [[Middle Ages]], he is best known for ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', and is considered the \"Father of English literature\". He was the first writer buried in [[Poets' Corner]] of [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>Robert DeMaria, Jr., Heesok Chang, Samantha Zacher, eds, ''A Companion to British Literature, Volume 2: Early Modern Literature, 1450\u20131660'', John Wiley & Sons, 2013, p. 41.</ref> Chaucer also gained fame as a philosopher and [[astronomer]], composing the scientific ''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'' for his 10-year-old son Lewis. He maintained a career in the civil service as a [[bureaucrat]], [[courtier]], diplomat, and member of parliament. \n\nAmong Chaucer's many other works are ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'', ''[[The House of Fame]]'', ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''.

In the City Hustings Roll 110, 5, Ric II, dated June 1380, Chaucer refers to himself as ''me Galfridum Chaucer, filium Johannis Chaucer, Vinetarii, Londonie'', which translates as: \"Geoffrey Chaucer, son of John Chaucer, vintners, London\".\n\n==Career==\nWhile records concerning the lives of his contemporaries, [[William Langland]] and the [[Pearl Poet]], are practically non-existent, since Chaucer was a public servant, his official life is very well documented, with nearly five hundred written items testifying to his career. The first of the \"Chaucer Life Records\" appears in 1357, in the household accounts of [[Elizabeth de Burgh, 4th Countess of Ulster|Elizabeth de Burgh]], the [[Earl of Ulster|Countess of Ulster]], when he became the noblewoman's page through his father's connections,<ref>Skeat (1899); Vol. I, p. xvii.</ref> a common medieval form of apprenticeship for boys into knighthood or prestige appointments. The countess was married to [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel, Duke of Clarence]], the second surviving son of the king, [[Edward III of England|Edward III]], and the position brought the teenage Chaucer into the close court circle, where he was to remain for the rest of his life. He also worked as a courtier, a diplomat, and a civil servant, as well as working for the king from 1389 to 1391 as Clerk of the King's Works.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Critical Companion to Chaucer: A Literary Reference to His Life and Work |last1=Rossignol |first1=Rosalyn |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |pages=551, 613 |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-8160-6193-8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1359, in the early stages of the [[Hundred Years' War]], [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] invaded France and Chaucer travelled with [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence]], Elizabeth's husband, as part of the [[History of the British Army|English army]].

Around 1366, Chaucer married [[Philippa (de) Roet]]. She was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III's queen, [[Philippa of Hainault]], and a sister of [[Katherine Swynford]], who later (c. 1396) became the third wife of [[John of Gaunt]]. It is uncertain how many children Chaucer and Philippa had, but three or four are most commonly cited. His son, [[Thomas Chaucer]], had an illustrious career, as [[Chief Butler of England|chief butler]] to four kings, envoy to France, and [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. Thomas's daughter, [[Alice de la Pole|Alice]], married the [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|Duke of Suffolk]].

He became a member of the royal court of Edward III as a ''[[valet de chambre]]'', [[yeoman]], or [[esquire]] on 20 June 1367, a position which could entail a wide variety of tasks. His wife also received a pension for court employment. He travelled abroad many times, at least some of them in his role as a valet. In 1368, he may have attended the wedding of [[Lionel of Antwerp, 1st Duke of Clarence|Lionel of Antwerp]] to [[Violante Visconti]], daughter of [[Galeazzo II Visconti]], in [[Milan]]. Two other literary stars of the era were in attendance: [[Jean Froissart]] and [[Petrarch]]. Around this time, Chaucer is believed to have written ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' in honour of [[Blanche of Lancaster]], the late wife of John of Gaunt, who died in 1369 of the plague.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Holt Literature and Language Arts |last= |first= |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |year=2003 |isbn=978-0030573743 |location= |pages=113}}</ref>\n\nChaucer travelled to [[Picardy]] the next year as part of a military expedition; in 1373 he visited [[Genoa]] and [[Florence]]. Numerous scholars such as Skeat, Boitani, and Rowland<ref>Companion to Chaucer Studies, Rev. ed., Oxford UP, 1979</ref> suggested that, on this Italian trip, [[Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio|he came into contact with Petrarch or Boccaccio]].

Later documents suggest it was a mission, along with Jean Froissart, to arrange a marriage between the future King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] and a French princess, thereby ending the [[Hundred Years War]]. If this was the purpose of their trip, they seem to have been unsuccessful, as no wedding occurred.\n\nIn 1378, Richard II sent Chaucer as an envoy (secret dispatch) to the Visconti and to Sir [[John Hawkwood]], English [[condottiere]] (mercenary leader) in [[Milan]]. It has been speculated that it was Hawkwood on whom Chaucer based his character the Knight in the ''Canterbury Tales'', for a description matches that of a 14th-century condottiere.\n\n[[File:Geoffrey Chaucer.jpeg|left|thumb|A 19th-century depiction of Chaucer]]\nA possible indication that his career as a writer was appreciated came when [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] granted Chaucer \"a gallon of wine daily for the rest of his life\" for some unspecified task. This was an unusual grant, but given on a day of celebration, [[St George's Day]], 1374, when artistic endeavours were traditionally rewarded, it is assumed to have been another early poetic work. It is not known which, if any, of Chaucer's extant works prompted the reward, but the suggestion of him as poet to a king places him as a precursor to later [[poets laureate]]. Chaucer continued to collect the liquid stipend until Richard II came to power, after which it was converted to a monetary grant on 18 April 1378.\n\nChaucer obtained the very substantial job of [[comptroller]] of the customs for the port of London, which he began on 8 June 1374.<ref>Morley, Henry (1890) ''English Writers: an attempt towards a history of English literature''. London: Cassell & Co.; Vol. V. p. 106.</ref> He must have been suited for the role as he continued in it for twelve years, a long time in such a post at that time. His life goes undocumented for much of the next ten years, but it is believed that he wrote (or began) most of his famous works during this period. He was mentioned in law papers of 4 May 1380, involved in the [[raptus]] (rape or seizure) of Cecilia Chaumpaigne.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://chaumpaigne.org/the-legal-documents/ |title=The Legal Documents |last=Waymack |first=Anna |year=2016 |website=De raptu meo }}</ref> What was meant is unclear, but the incident seems to have been resolved quickly with an exchange of money in June 1380 and did not leave a stain on Chaucer's reputation. It is not known if Chaucer was in the City of London at the time of the [[Peasants' Revolt]], but if he was, he would have seen its leaders pass almost directly under his apartment window at [[Aldgate]].<ref>Saunders, Corrine J. (2006) ''A Concise Companion to Chaucer''. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 19.</ref>\n\nWhile still working as comptroller, Chaucer appears to have moved to [[Kent]], being appointed as one of the commissioners of peace for Kent, at a time when French invasion was a possibility. He is thought to have started work on ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the early 1380s. He also became a member of parliament for Kent in 1386, and attended the '[[Wonderful Parliament]]' that year. He appears to have been present at most of the 71 days it sat, for which he was paid \u00a324 9s.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Scott |first=F.

He survived the political upheavals caused by the [[Lords Appellant]]s, despite the fact that Chaucer knew some of the men executed over the affair quite well.\n\nOn 12 July 1389, Chaucer was appointed the [[Clerk of the Works|clerk of the king's works]], a sort of [[Construction foreman|foreman]] organising most of the king's building projects.<ref>Morley (1890), Vol. 5, p. 245.</ref> No major works were begun during his tenure, but he did conduct repairs on [[Westminster Palace]], [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor]], continue building the wharf at the [[Tower of London]], and build the stands for a tournament held in 1390. It may have been a difficult job, but it paid well: two [[shilling]]s a day, more than three times his salary as a comptroller. Chaucer was also appointed keeper of the lodge at the King's park in [[Feckenham Forest|Feckenham]], which was a largely honorary appointment.<ref>Forest of Feckenham, John Humphreys FSA, in Birmingham and Warwickshire Archaeology Society's Transactions and proceedings, Volumes 44\u201345, p. 117.</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nIn September 1390, records say that Chaucer was robbed and possibly injured while conducting the business, and he stopped working in this capacity on 17 June 1391.

Chaucer was buried in Westminster Abbey in London, as was his right owing to his status as a tenant of the Abbey's close. In 1556, his remains were transferred to a more ornate tomb, making him the first writer interred in the area now known as [[Poets' Corner]].\n\n==Relationship to John of Gaunt==\nChaucer was a close friend of [[John of Gaunt]], the wealthy [[Duke of Lancaster]] and father of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]], and he served under Lancaster's patronage. Near the end of their lives, Lancaster and Chaucer became brothers-in-law when Chaucer married [[Philippa (de) Roet|Philippa (Pan) de Roet]] in 1366, and Lancaster married Phillippa's sister [[Katherine Swynford]] (de Roet) in 1396.\n\nChaucer's ''[[Book of the Duchess]]'' (also known as the ''Deeth of Blaunche the Duchesse'')<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Riverside Chaucer |last1=Chaucer |first1=Geoffrey |editor1-last=Benson |editor1-first=Larry D. |editor2-last=Pratt |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Robinson |editor3-first=F.

The phrase \"long castel\" is a reference to Lancaster (also called \"Loncastel\" and \"Longcastell\"), \"walles white\" is thought to be an oblique reference to Blanche, \"Seynt Johan\" was John of Gaunt's name-saint, and \"ryche hil\" is a reference to Richmond. These references reveal the identity of the grieving black knight of the poem as John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster and Earl of Richmond. \"White\" is the English translation of the French word \"blanche\", implying that the white lady was [[Blanche of Lancaster]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Riverside Chaucer |last1=Wilcockson |first1=Colin |editor1-last=Benson |editor1-first=Larry D. |editor2-last=Pratt |editor2-first=Robert |editor3-last=Robinson |editor3-first=F.

''Fortune'', in turn, does not understand Chaucer's harsh words to her for she believes that she has been kind to him, claims that he does not know what she has in store for him in the future, but most importantly, \"And eek thou hast thy beste frend alyve\" (32, 40, 48). Chaucer retorts, \"My frend maystow nat reven, blind goddesse\" (50) and orders her to take away those who merely pretend to be his friends. ''Fortune'' turns her attention to three princes whom she implores to relieve Chaucer of his pain and \"Preyeth his beste frend of his noblesse/That to som beter estat he may atteyne\" (78\u201379). The three princes are believed to represent the dukes of Lancaster, [[Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York|York]], and [[Thomas of Woodstock, 1st Duke of Gloucester|Gloucester]], and a portion of line 76 (\"as three of you or tweyne\") is thought to refer to the ordinance of 1390 which specified that no royal gift could be authorised without the consent of at least two of the three dukes.<ref name=\"Gross, Zaila 1987 635\" /> Most conspicuous in this short poem is the number of references to Chaucer's \"beste frend\". ''Fortune'' states three times in her response to the plaintiff, \"And also, you still have your best friend alive\" (32, 40, 48); she also refers to his \"beste frend\" in the envoy when appealing to his \"noblesse\" to help Chaucer to a higher estate. The narrator makes a fifth reference when he rails at ''Fortune'' that she shall not take his friend from him.\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nChaucer's attitudes toward the Church should not be confused with his attitudes toward Christianity.

B. McCully and J. J. Anderson, ''English Historical Metrics'', Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 97.</ref> Chaucer is known for metrical innovation, inventing the [[rhyme royal]], and he was one of the first English poets to use the five-stress line, a decasyllabic cousin to the [[iambic pentameter]], in his work, with only a few anonymous short works using it before him.<ref>[[Marchette Chute]], ''Geoffrey Chaucer of England'' E. P. Dutton, 1946, p. 89.</ref> The arrangement of these five-stress lines into rhyming [[couplet]]s, first seen in his ''[[The Legend of Good Women]]'', was used in much of his later work and became one of the standard poetic forms in English. His early influence as a satirist is also important, with the common humorous device, the funny accent of a regional [[dialect]], apparently making its first appearance in ''[[The Reeve's Tale]]''.\n\nThe poetry of Chaucer, along with other writers of the era, is credited with helping to standardise the London Dialect of the [[Middle English]] language from a combination of the Kentish and Midlands dialects.<ref>Edwin Winfield Bowen, ''Questions at Issue in our English Speech'', NY: Broadway Publishing, 1909, p. 147.</ref> This is probably overstated; the influence of the court, [[Lord Chancellor|chancery]] and bureaucracy \u2013 of which Chaucer was a part \u2013 remains a more probable influence on the development of [[Standard English]]. [[Modern English]] is somewhat distanced from the language of Chaucer's poems owing to the effect of the [[Great Vowel Shift]] some time after his death. This change in the [[pronunciation]] of English, still not fully understood, makes the reading of Chaucer difficult for the modern audience. The status of the final ''-e'' in Chaucer's verse is uncertain: it seems likely that during the period of Chaucer's writing the final ''-e'' was dropping out of colloquial English and that its use was somewhat irregular. Chaucer's versification suggests that the final ''-e'' is sometimes to be vocalised, and sometimes to be silent; however, this remains a point on which there is disagreement. When it is vocalised, most scholars pronounce it as a [[schwa]]. Apart from the irregular spelling, much of the vocabulary is recognisable to the modern reader. Chaucer is also recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as the first author to use many common English words in his writings. These words were probably frequently used in the language at the time but Chaucer, with his ear for common speech, is the earliest extant manuscript source. ''Acceptable'', ''alkali'', ''altercation'', ''amble'', ''angrily'', ''annex'', ''annoyance'', ''approaching'', ''arbitration'', ''armless'', ''army'', ''arrogant'', ''arsenic'', ''arc'', ''artillery'' and ''aspect'' are just some of the many [[English words first attested in Chaucer]].\n\n===Literary===\nWidespread knowledge of Chaucer's works is attested by the many poets who imitated or responded to his writing. [[John Lydgate]] was one of the earliest poets to write continuations of Chaucer's unfinished ''Tales'' while [[Robert Henryson]]'s ''Testament of Cresseid'' completes the story of [[Cressida]] left unfinished in his ''Troilus and Criseyde''. Many of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works contain material from these poets and later appreciations by the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]] poets were shaped by their failure to distinguish the later \"additions\" from original Chaucer. Writers of the 17th and 18th centuries, such as [[John Dryden]], admired Chaucer for his stories, but not for his rhythm and rhyme, as few critics could then read Middle English and the text had been butchered by printers, leaving a somewhat unadmirable mess.<ref>\"From The Preface to ''Fables Ancient and Modern''\". ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature''. Stephen Greenblatt. 8th ed. Vol. C. New York, London: Norton, 2006. 2132\u201333. p. 2132.</ref> It was not until the late 19th century that the official Chaucerian canon, accepted today, was decided upon, largely as a result of [[Walter William Skeat]]'s work. Roughly seventy-five years after Chaucer's death, ''The Canterbury Tales'' was selected by [[William Caxton]] to be one of the first books to be printed in England.\n\n===English===\nChaucer is sometimes considered the source of the English vernacular tradition. His achievement for the language can be seen as part of a general historical trend towards the creation of a [[vernacular literature]], after the example of [[Dante]], in many parts of Europe. A parallel trend in Chaucer's own lifetime was underway in Scotland through the work of his slightly earlier contemporary, [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]], and was likely to have been even more general, as is evidenced by the example of the [[Pearl Poet]] in the north of England.\n\nAlthough Chaucer's language is much closer to Modern English than the text of ''[[Beowulf]]'', such that (unlike that of ''Beowulf'') a Modern English-speaker with a large vocabulary of archaic words may understand it, it differs enough that most publications modernise his idiom. The following is a sample from the prologue of ''[[The Summoner's Tale]]'' that compares Chaucer's text to a modern translation:\n\n:{| cellspacing=\"4\" style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"\n| || ''Original Text'' || ''Modern Translation''\n|-\n| || This frere bosteth that he knoweth helle,\n| This friar boasts that he knows hell,\n|-\n| || And God it woot, that it is litel wonder;\n| And God knows that it is little wonder;\n|-\n| || Freres and feendes been but lyte asonder.\n| Friars and fiends are seldom far apart.\n|-\n| || For, pardee, ye han ofte tyme herd telle\n| For, by God, you have ofttimes heard tell\n|-\n|  || How that a frere ravyshed was to helle\n| How a friar was taken to hell\n|-\n| || In spirit ones by a visioun;\n| In spirit, once by a vision;\n|-\n| || And as an angel ladde hym up and doun,\n| And as an angel led him up and down,\n|-\n|  || To shewen hym the peynes that the were,\n| To show him the pains that were there,\n|-\n| || In al the place saugh he nat a frere;\n| In all the place he saw not a friar;\n|-\n| || Of oother folk he saugh ynowe in wo.\n| Of other folk he saw enough in woe.\n|-\n|  || Unto this angel spak the frere tho:\n| Unto this angel spoke the friar thus:\n|-\n| || Now, sire, quod he, han freres swich a grace     \n| \"Now sir\", said he, \"Have friars such a grace\n|-\n| || That noon of hem shal come to this place?\n| That none of them come to this place?\"\n|-\n| || Yis, quod this aungel, many a millioun!\n| \"Yes\", said the angel, \"many a million!\"\n|-\n| || And unto sathanas he ladde hym doun.\n| And unto Satan the angel led him down.\n|-\n| || \u2013And now hath sathanas, \u2013seith he, \u2013a tayl\n| \"And now Satan has\", he said, \"a tail,\n|-\n|  || Brodder than of a carryk is the sayl.\n| Broader than a galleon's sail.\n|-\n| || Hold up thy tayl, thou sathanas!\u2013quod he;\n| Hold up your tail, Satan!\" said he.\n|-\n| || \u2013shewe forth thyn ers, and lat the frere se\n| \"Show forth your arse, and let the friar see\n|-\n| || Where is the nest of freres in this place!\u2013\n| Where the nest of friars is in this place!\"\n|-\n| || And er that half a furlong wey of space,\n| And before half a furlong of space,\n|-\n| || Right so as bees out swarmen from an hyve,    \n| Just as bees swarm out from a hive,\n|-\n| ||Out of the develes ers ther gonne dryve\n| Out of the devil's arse there were driven\n|-\n| || Twenty thousand freres on a route,\n| Twenty thousand friars on a rout,\n|-\n| || And thurghout helle swarmed al aboute,\n| And throughout hell swarmed all about,\n|-\n| || And comen agayn as faste as they may gon,    \n| And came again as fast as they could go,\n|-\n| || And in his ers they crepten everychon.\n| And every one crept into his arse.\n|-\n|  ||He clapte his tayl agayn and lay ful stille.\n| He shut his tail again and lay very still.<ref>Original e-text available online at the [http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=Cha2Can.sgm&images=images/modeng&data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&tag=public&part=17&division=div2 University of Virginia website], trans.

There are 83 surviving manuscripts of the Canterbury Tales (in whole or part) alone, along with sixteen of ''Troilus and Criseyde'', including the personal copy of [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]].<ref>Benson, Larry, ''The Riverside Chaucer'' (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987), p. 1118.</ref> Given the ravages of time, it is likely that these surviving manuscripts represent hundreds since lost. Chaucer's original audience was a courtly one, and would have included women as well as men of the upper social classes. Yet even before his death in 1400, Chaucer's audience had begun to include members of the rising literate, middle and merchant classes, which included many [[Lollard]] sympathisers who may well have been inclined to read Chaucer as one of their own, particularly in his satirical writings about friars, priests, and other church officials. In 1464, John Baron, a tenant farmer in Agmondesham ([[Amersham]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]), was brought before [[John Chadworth]], the Bishop of Lincoln, on charges of being a Lollard heretic; he confessed to owning a \"boke of the Tales of Caunterburie\" among other suspect volumes.<ref>Potter, Russell A., \"Chaucer and the Authority of Language: The Politics and Poetics of the Vernacular in Late Medieval England\", ''Assays'' VI (Carnegie-Mellon Press, 1991), p. 91.</ref>\n\n===Printed editions===\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\n[[William Caxton]], the first English printer, was responsible for the first two [[folio]] editions of ''The Canterbury Tales'' which were published in 1478 and 1483.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm |title=A Leaf from The Canterbury Tales | location=Westminster, England \n| publisher=William Caxton | year=1473 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051031075730/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg076.htm |archivedate=31 October 2005}}</ref> Caxton's second printing, by his own account, came about because a customer complained that the printed text differed from a manuscript he knew; Caxton obligingly used the man's manuscript as his source. Both Caxton editions carry the equivalent of manuscript authority. Caxton's edition was reprinted by his successor, [[Wynkyn de Worde]], but this edition has no independent authority.\n \n[[Richard Pynson]], the [[King's Printer]] under Henry VIII for about twenty years, was the first to collect and sell something that resembled an edition of the collected works of Chaucer; however, in the process, he introduced five previously printed texts that are now known not to be Chaucer's. (The collection is actually three separately printed texts, or collections of texts, bound together as one volume.) There is a likely connection between Pynson's product and [[William Thynne]]'s a mere six years later. Thynne had a successful career from the 1520s until his death in 1546, as chief clerk of the kitchen of Henry VIII, one of the masters of the royal household. He spent years comparing various versions of Chaucer's works, and selected 41 pieces for publication. While there were questions over the authorship of some of the material, there is not doubt this was the first comprehensive view of Chaucer's work. ''The Workes of Geffray Chaucer,'' published in 1532, was the first edition of Chaucer's collected works. His editions of ''Chaucer's Works'' in 1532 and 1542 were the first major contributions to the existence of a widely recognised Chaucerian [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]. Thynne represents his edition as a book sponsored by and supportive of the king who is praised in the preface by [[Sir Brian Tuke]]. Thynne's canon brought the number of apocryphal works associated with Chaucer to a total of 28, even if that was not his intention.<ref name=Stow1561 />  As with Pynson, once included in the ''Works'', [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]] texts stayed with those works, regardless of their first editor's intentions.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, Chaucer was printed more than any other English author, and he was the first author to have his works collected in comprehensive single-volume editions in which a Chaucer [[wikt:canon|canon]] began to cohere. Some scholars contend that 16th-century editions of Chaucer's ''Works'' set the precedent for all other English authors in terms of presentation, prestige and success in print. These editions certainly established Chaucer's reputation, but they also began the complicated process of reconstructing and frequently inventing Chaucer's biography and the canonical list of works which were attributed to him.\n\nProbably the most significant aspect of the growing [[apocrypha]] is that, beginning with Thynne's editions, it began to include medieval texts that made Chaucer appear as a [[proto-Protestantism|proto-Protestant]] [[Lollard]], primarily the ''[[Testament of Love]]'' and ''[[The Plowman's Tale]]''. As \"Chaucerian\" works that were not considered apocryphal until the late 19th century, these medieval texts enjoyed a new life, with English Protestants carrying on the earlier Lollard project of appropriating existing texts and authors who seemed sympathetic\u2014or malleable enough to be construed as sympathetic\u2014to their cause. The official Chaucer of the early printed volumes of his ''Works'' was construed as a proto-Protestant as the same was done, concurrently, with [[William Langland]] and ''[[Piers Plowman]]''.\n\nThe famous ''Plowman's Tale'' did not enter Thynne's ''Works'' until the second, 1542, edition. Its entry was surely facilitated by Thynne's inclusion of [[Thomas Usk]]'s ''Testament of Love'' in the first edition. The ''Testament of Love'' imitates, borrows from, and thus resembles Usk's contemporary, Chaucer. (''Testament of Love'' also appears to borrow from ''Piers Plowman''.) Since the ''Testament of Love'' mentions its author's part in a failed plot (book 1, chapter 6), his imprisonment, and (perhaps) a recantation of (possibly Lollard) heresy, all this was associated with Chaucer. (Usk himself was executed as a traitor in 1388.) [[John Foxe]] took this recantation of heresy as a defence of the true faith, calling Chaucer a \"right Wiclevian\" and (erroneously) identifying him as a schoolmate and close friend of [[John Wycliffe]] at [[Merton College, Oxford]]. ([[Thomas Speght]] is careful to highlight these facts in his editions and his \"Life of Chaucer\".) No other sources for the ''Testament of Love'' exist\u2014there is only Thynne's construction of whatever manuscript sources he had.\n\n[[John Stow]] (1525\u20131605) was an antiquarian and also a chronicler. His edition of Chaucer's ''Works'' in 1561<ref name=Stow1561>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm |title=UWM.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051111220719/http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg077.htm |archivedate=11 November 2005}}</ref> brought the apocrypha to more than 50 titles. More were added in the 17th century, and they remained as late as 1810, well after [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] pared the canon down in his 1775 edition.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Library/special/exhibits/clastext/clspg079.htm |title=The Canterbury Tales of Chaucer: To Which are Added an Essay on his Language and Versification, and an Introductory Discourse, Together with Notes and a Glossary by the late Thomas Tyrwhitt.

What was added to Chaucer often helped represent him favourably to Protestant England.\n\n[[File:Chaucer 1602.jpg|thumb|Engraving of Chaucer from [[Thomas Speght|Speght's]] edition. The two top shields display: ''Per pale argent and gules, a bend counterchanged'' (Chaucer), that at bottom left: ''Gules, three [[Breaking wheel|Catherine Wheels]] or'' (Roet, [[canting arms]], French ''rouet'' = \"spinning wheel\"), and that at bottom right displays Roet quartering ''Argent, a chief gules overall a lion rampant double queued or'' (Chaucer) with crest of Chaucer above: ''A unicorn head'']]\n\nIn his 1598 edition of the ''Works'', Speght (probably taking cues from Foxe) made good use of Usk's account of his political intrigue and imprisonment in the ''Testament of Love'' to assemble a largely fictional \"Life of Our Learned English Poet, Geffrey Chaucer\". Speght's \"Life\" presents readers with an erstwhile radical in troubled times much like their own, a proto-Protestant who eventually came round to the king's views on religion. Speght states, \"In the second year of Richard the second, the King tooke Geffrey Chaucer and his lands into his protection. The occasion wherof no doubt was some daunger and trouble whereinto he was fallen by favouring some rash attempt of the common people.\" Under the discussion of Chaucer's friends, namely John of Gaunt, Speght further explains:\n\n::Yet it seemeth that [Chaucer] was in some trouble in the daies of King Richard the second, as it may appeare in the Testament of Loue: where hee doth greatly complaine of his owne rashnesse in following the multitude, and of their hatred against him for bewraying their purpose. And in that complaint which he maketh to his empty purse, I do find a written copy, which I had of Iohn Stow (whose library hath helped many writers) wherein ten times more is adioined, then is in print. Where he maketh great lamentation for his wrongfull imprisonment, wishing death to end his daies: which in my iudgement doth greatly accord with that in the Testament of Loue. Moreouer we find it thus in Record.\n\nLater, in \"The [[Argument (literature)|Argument]]\" to the ''Testament of Love'', Speght adds:\n::Chaucer did compile this booke as a comfort to himselfe after great griefs conceiued for some rash attempts of the commons, with whome he had ioyned, and thereby was in feare to loose the fauour of his best friends.\n\nSpeght is also the source of the famous tale of Chaucer being fined for beating a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] in [[Fleet Street]], as well as a fictitious [[coat of arms]] and [[family tree]]. Ironically \u2013 and perhaps consciously so \u2013 an introductory, apologetic letter in Speght's edition from [[Francis Beaumont]] defends the unseemly, \"low\", and bawdy bits in Chaucer from an elite, classicist position. Francis Thynne noted some of these inconsistencies in his ''Animadversions'', insisting that Chaucer was not a commoner, and he objected to the friar-beating story. Yet Thynne himself underscores Chaucer's support for popular religious reform, associating Chaucer's views with his father William Thynne's attempts to include ''The Plowman's Tale'' and ''The Pilgrim's Tale'' in the 1532 and 1542 ''Works''.\n\nThe myth of the Protestant Chaucer continues to have a lasting impact on a large body of Chaucerian scholarship. Though it is extremely rare for a modern scholar to suggest Chaucer supported a religious movement that did not exist until more than a century after his death, the predominance of this thinking for so many centuries left it for granted that Chaucer was at least hostile toward Catholicism. This assumption forms a large part of many critical approaches to Chaucer's works, including neo-Marxism.\n\nAlongside Chaucer's ''Works'', the most impressive literary monument of the period is [[John Foxe]]'s ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|Acts and Monuments...]]''. As with the Chaucer editions, it was critically significant to English Protestant identity and included Chaucer in its project. Foxe's Chaucer both derived from and contributed to the printed editions of Chaucer's ''Works'', particularly the pseudepigrapha. ''Jack Upland'' was first printed in Foxe's ''Acts and Monuments'', and then it appeared in Speght's edition of Chaucer's ''Works''. Speght's \"Life of Chaucer\" echoes Foxe's own account, which is itself dependent upon the earlier editions that added the ''Testament of Love'' and ''The Plowman's Tale'' to their pages. Like Speght's Chaucer, Foxe's Chaucer was also a shrewd (or lucky) political survivor. In his 1563 edition, Foxe \"thought it not out of season \u2026 to couple \u2026 some mention of Geoffrey Chaucer\" with a discussion of [[John Colet]], a possible source for [[John Skelton]]'s character [[Colin Clout]].\n\nProbably referring to the 1542 [[Act for the Advancement of True Religion]], Foxe said that he \"marvel[s] to consider \u2026 how the bishops, condemning and abolishing all manner of English books and treatises which might bring the people to any light of knowledge, did yet authorise the works of Chaucer to remain still and to be occupied; who, no doubt, saw into religion as much almost as even we do now, and uttereth in his works no less, and seemeth to be a right Wicklevian, or else there never was any. And that, all his works almost, if they be thoroughly advised, will testify (albeit done in mirth, and covertly); and especially the latter end of his third book of the Testament of Love \u2026 Wherein, except a man be altogether blind, he may espy him at the full: although in the same book (as in all others he useth to do), under shadows covertly, as under a visor, he suborneth truth in such sort, as both privily she may profit the godly-minded, and yet not be espied of the crafty adversary. And therefore the bishops, belike, taking his works but for jests and toys, in condemning other books, yet permitted his books to be read.\"\n\nIt is significant, too, that Foxe's discussion of Chaucer leads into his history of \"The Reformation of the Church of Christ in the Time of Martin Luther\" when \"Printing, being opened, incontinently ministered unto the church the instruments and tools of learning and knowledge; which were good books and authors, which before lay hid and unknown. The science of printing being found, immediately followed the grace of God; which stirred up good wits aptly to conceive the light of knowledge and judgment: by which light darkness began to be espied, and ignorance to be detected; truth from error, religion from superstition, to be discerned.\"\n\nFoxe downplays Chaucer's bawdy and amorous writing, insisting that it all testifies to his piety. Material that is troubling is deemed metaphoric, while the more forthright satire (which Foxe prefers) is taken literally.\n[[File:Chaucer1721.jpg|thumb|left|Spine and Titlepage of the 1721 [[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry edition]] of Chaucer's complete works]]\n\n[[John Urry (literary editor)|John Urry]] produced the first edition of the complete works of Chaucer in a Latin font, published posthumously in 1721. Included were several tales, according to the editors, for the first time printed, a biography of Chaucer, a glossary of old English words, and testimonials of author writers concerning Chaucer dating back to the 16th century. According to A. S. G Edwards, \"This was the first collected edition of Chaucer to be printed in roman type. The life of Chaucer prefixed to the volume was the work of the Reverend [[John Dart]], corrected and revised by Timothy Thomas. The glossary appended was also mainly compiled by Thomas. The text of Urry's edition has often been criticised by subsequent editors for its frequent conjectural emendations, mainly to make it conform to his sense of Chaucer's metre. The justice of such criticisms should not obscure his achievement. His is the first edition of Chaucer for nearly a hundred and fifty years to consult any manuscripts and is the first since that of William Thynne in 1534 to seek systematically to assemble a substantial number of manuscripts to establish his text. It is also the first edition to offer descriptions of the manuscripts of Chaucer's works, and the first to print texts of 'Gamelyn' and 'The Tale of Beryn', works ascribed to, but not by, Chaucer.\"\n\n===Modern scholarship===\nAlthough Chaucer's works had long been admired, serious scholarly work on his legacy did not begin until the late 18th century, when [[Thomas Tyrwhitt]] edited ''The Canterbury Tales'', and it did not become an established academic discipline until the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Chaucer: The Critical Heritage.

[[Walter William Skeat]], who like Furnivall was closely associated with the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', established the base text of all of Chaucer's works with his edition, published by Oxford University Press. Later editions by John H. Fisher and Larry D. Benson offered further refinements, along with critical commentary and bibliographies.\n\nWith the textual issues largely addressed, if not resolved, attention turned to the questions of Chaucer's themes, structure, and audience. The ''Chaucer Review'' was founded in 1966 and has maintained its position as the pre-eminent journal of Chaucer studies.\n\n==List of works==\nThe following major works are in rough chronological order but scholars still debate the dating of most of Chaucer's output and works made up from a collection of stories may have been compiled over a long period.\n\n===Major works===\n*Translation of ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', possibly extant as ''[[The Romaunt of the Rose]]''\n*''[[The Book of the Duchess]]''\n*''[[The House of Fame]]''\n*''[[Anelida and Arcite]]''\n*''[[Parlement of Foules]]''\n*Translation of [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' as ''[[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]]''\n*''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''\n*''[[The Legend of Good Women]]''\n*''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''\n*''[[A Treatise on the Astrolabe]]''\n\n===Short poems===\n[[File:Balade to Rosemounde.jpg|thumb|''Balade to Rosemounde'']]\n*''An ABC''\n*''Chaucers Wordes unto Adam, His Owne Scriveyn'' (disputed)<ref>Weiskott, Eric. \"''Adam Scriveyn'' and Chaucer's Metrical Practice.\" ''Medium \u00c6vum'' 86 (2017): 147\u201351.</ref>\n*''The Complaint unto Pity''\n*''The Complaint of Chaucer to his Purse''\n*''[[The Complaint of Mars]]''\n*''The Complaint of Venus''\n*''A Complaint to His Lady''\n*''The Former Age''\n*''Fortune''\n*''Gentilesse''\n*''Lak of Stedfastnesse''\n*''Lenvoy de Chaucer a Scogan''\n*''Lenvoy de Chaucer a Bukton''\n*''Proverbs''\n*''Balade to Rosemounde''\n*''Truth''\n*''Womanly Noblesse''\n\n===Poems of doubtful authorship===\n*''Against Women Unconstant''\n*''A Balade of Complaint''\n*''Complaynt D'Amours''\n*''Merciles Beaute''\n*''The Equatorie of the Planets''&nbsp;\u2013 A rough translation of a Latin work derived from an Arab work of the same title.

The similar ''[[Treatise on the Astrolabe]]'', not usually doubted as Chaucer's work, in addition to Chaucer's name as a gloss to the manuscript are the main pieces of evidence for the ascription to Chaucer. However, the evidence Chaucer wrote such a work is questionable, and as such is not included in ''The Riverside Chaucer''.

The couple had seven children between 1868 and 1879, four of them died from a heart condition before the age of five. Her son, [[Harry Wolstenholme]], was a [[lawyer]] and keen amateur [[ornithologist]]. The Wolstenholmes built a large house called  'Maybanke' in [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]]. The later years of the marriage were unhappy; Edmund had a number of business failures and became an alcoholic, leaving the family in 1884. Maybanke had to wait for the passage of the ''[[Divorce Amendment and Extension Act]]'' in 1892 before she could [[divorce]] Edmund on the grounds of ''\"three years of desertion.\"'' The divorce was finalised in 1893.<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite book |title= Maybanke Anderson: SEX, suffrage and social reform|last= Roberts|first=Jan |year= 1993|publisher= Hale & Iremonger|location= Sydney|isbn= 0868064955}} p.37</ref> After the divorce, she was supported financially by her brother, the renowned engineer [[Norman Selfe]], with whom she would later campaign for education reform.{{sfn|Roberts|1993|p=54}}\n\nIn 1885 Maybanke opened Maybanke School, a girls' school that she operated in her home preparing girls for the [[University of Sydney]] entrance examination. Operating for 10 years, the school was later known as Maybanke College.<ref>Nugent, A. 2001.

She became active in the women's suffrage movement; she believed that the vote was 'the kernel for all reform'. She was vice president of the Women's Literary Society started by her friend [[Rose Scott]]. Many of the society's members would go on to form the [[Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales]] (WSL) on 6 May 1891.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/guides/federation/politics.html |title=Federation Political Groups\u2014to 1901 and beyond | accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref> In 1893 she was elected to the WSL presidency, and founded the Australasian Home Reading Union in the same year. The Union was a program to promote induction by organising small study groups in rural areas.\n\nIn 1894, she began publishing the fortnightly newspaper ''Woman's Voice''. The paper ran for 18 months, drawing women's attention to suffrage issues at the national and international level. In 1895 she established the first free kindergarten in [[Australia]] at [[Woolloomooloo, New South Wales|Woolloomooloo]] as the president of the Kindergarten Union, helping the children of working mothers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2009/2656479.htm |title=Gardens for children and workshops for classrooms: Maybanke Anderson, Norman Selfe and the New Education - Hindsight, Radio National 16 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-02-26|date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe WSL's attempts to have suffrage implemented by the New South Wales government were not fruitful; however, in 1897, Maybanke decided to petition the 1897 Federal Convention in [[Adelaide]]. She reasoned that this would have the women's vote written into the Federal agenda. Thus, the women from [[South Australia|South]] and [[Western Australia]] who already had the vote could not have it taken from them, and if there was suffrage at the federal level, it would flow down to the states. At this time, she also became involved in the [[Federation of Australia|pro-federation movement]]. Maybanke resigned from the WSL in 1897. Suffrage was extended to the women of New South Wales in 1902.\n\nMaybanke was inducted onto the [[Victorian Honour Roll of Women]] in 2001 in recognition of her achievements.\n\n==Marriage and travel==\nIn 1899 Maybanke married her second husband, [[Francis Anderson (philosopher)|Sir Francis Anderson]]. Anderson was the first Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]]. They travelled and worked together on voluntary projects, including campaigning to have women stand for local government.

Her family migrated to [[Australia]] as free settlers when she was nine years old. Twelve years later in September 1867 she married Edmund Kay Wolstenholme, a timber merchant. The couple had seven children between 1868 and 1879, four of them died from a heart condition before the age of five. Her son, [[Harry Wolstenholme]], was a [[lawyer]] and keen amateur [[ornithologist]]. The Wolstenholmes built a large house called  'Maybanke' in [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]]. The later years of the marriage were unhappy; Edmund had a number of business failures and became an alcoholic, leaving the family in 1884. Maybanke had to wait for the passage of the ''[[Divorce Amendment and Extension Act]]'' in 1892 before she could [[divorce]] Edmund on the grounds of ''\"three years of desertion.\"'' The divorce was finalised in 1893.<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite book |title= Maybanke Anderson: SEX, suffrage and social reform|last= Roberts|first=Jan |year= 1993|publisher= Hale & Iremonger|location= Sydney|isbn= 0868064955}} p.37</ref> After the divorce, she was supported financially by her brother, the renowned engineer [[Norman Selfe]], with whom she would later campaign for education reform.{{sfn|Roberts|1993|p=54}}\n\nIn 1885 Maybanke opened Maybanke School, a girls' school that she operated in her home preparing girls for the [[University of Sydney]] entrance examination. Operating for 10 years, the school was later known as Maybanke College.<ref>Nugent, A. 2001.

She became active in the women's suffrage movement; she believed that the vote was 'the kernel for all reform'. She was vice president of the Women's Literary Society started by her friend [[Rose Scott]]. Many of the society's members would go on to form the [[Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales]] (WSL) on 6 May 1891.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/guides/federation/politics.html |title=Federation Political Groups\u2014to 1901 and beyond | accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref> In 1893 she was elected to the WSL presidency, and founded the Australasian Home Reading Union in the same year. The Union was a program to promote induction by organising small study groups in rural areas.\n\nIn 1894, she began publishing the fortnightly newspaper ''Woman's Voice''. The paper ran for 18 months, drawing women's attention to suffrage issues at the national and international level. In 1895 she established the first free kindergarten in [[Australia]] at [[Woolloomooloo, New South Wales|Woolloomooloo]] as the president of the Kindergarten Union, helping the children of working mothers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2009/2656479.htm |title=Gardens for children and workshops for classrooms: Maybanke Anderson, Norman Selfe and the New Education - Hindsight, Radio National 16 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-02-26|date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe WSL's attempts to have suffrage implemented by the New South Wales government were not fruitful; however, in 1897, Maybanke decided to petition the 1897 Federal Convention in [[Adelaide]]. She reasoned that this would have the women's vote written into the Federal agenda. Thus, the women from [[South Australia|South]] and [[Western Australia]] who already had the vote could not have it taken from them, and if there was suffrage at the federal level, it would flow down to the states. At this time, she also became involved in the [[Federation of Australia|pro-federation movement]]. Maybanke resigned from the WSL in 1897. Suffrage was extended to the women of New South Wales in 1902.\n\nMaybanke was inducted onto the [[Victorian Honour Roll of Women]] in 2001 in recognition of her achievements.\n\n==Marriage and travel==\nIn 1899 Maybanke married her second husband, [[Francis Anderson (philosopher)|Sir Francis Anderson]]. Anderson was the first Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]]. They travelled and worked together on voluntary projects, including campaigning to have women stand for local government.

The ribosomes and associated molecules are also known as the ''translational apparatus''.\n\n==Overview==\nThe sequence of [[DNA]] that encodes the sequence of the amino acids in a protein, is transcribed into a messenger RNA chain. Ribosomes bind to messenger RNAs and use its sequence for determining the correct sequence of amino acids to generate a given protein. Amino acids are selected and carried to the ribosome by [[transfer RNA|transfer RNA (tRNA)]] molecules, which enter the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain via an anti-codon stem loop. For each coding triplet in the messenger RNA, there is a transfer RNA that matches and carries the correct amino acid for incorporating into a growing polypeptide chain. Once the protein is produced, it can then [[protein folding|fold]] to produce a functional three-dimensional structure.\n\nA ribosome is made from [[biomolecular complex|complexes]] of RNAs and proteins and is therefore a [[Ribonucleoprotein particle|ribonucleoprotein complex]]. Each ribosome is divided into two subunits:\n# a smaller subunit which binds to a larger subunit and the mRNA, and\n# a larger subunit which binds to the aminoacylated tRNAs and the smaller subunit.\nWhen a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule, these two subunits split apart. Ribosomes are [[ribozyme|ribozymes]], because the [[Catalysis|catalytic]] [[peptidyl transferase]] activity that links amino acids together is performed by the ribosomal RNA. Ribosomes are often associated with the intracellular membranes that make up the [[endoplasmic reticulum#Rough endoplasmic reticulum|rough endoplasmic reticulum]].\n\nRibosomes from [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[eukaryote|eukaryotes]] in the [[three-domain system]] resemble each other to a remarkable degree, evidence of a common origin. They differ in their size, sequence, structure, and the ratio of protein to RNA. The differences in structure allow some [[antibiotic|antibiotics]] to kill bacteria by inhibiting their ribosomes, while leaving human ribosomes unaffected. In all species, more than one ribosome may move along a single mRNA chain at one time (as a [[polysome]]), each \"reading\" its sequence and producing a corresponding protein molecule.\n\nThe [[mitochondrial ribosome|mitochondrial ribosomes]] of eukaryotic cells functionally resemble many features of those in bacteria, reflecting the likely evolutionary origin of mitochondria.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benne R, Sloof P | title = Evolution of the mitochondrial protein synthetic machinery | journal = Bio Systems | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 51\u201368 | year = 1987 | pmid = 2446672 | doi = 10.1016/0303-2647(87)90006-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.stedwards.edu/chem/Chemistry/CHEM43/CHEM43/Ribosomes/Ribosome.HTML|title=Ribosomes|access-date=2011-04-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320163538/http://www.cs.stedwards.edu/chem/Chemistry/CHEM43/CHEM43/Ribosomes/Ribosome.HTML|archive-date=2009-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery==\nRibosomes were first observed in the mid-1950s by [[Romanian-American]] cell biologist [[George Emil Palade]], using an [[electron microscope]], as dense particles or granules.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Palade GE | title = A small particulate component of the cytoplasm | journal = The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 59\u201368 | date = January 1955 | pmid = 14381428 | pmc = 2223592 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.1.1.59 }}</ref> The term \"ribosome\" was proposed by scientist Richard B.

It is largely made up of specialized RNA known as [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) as well as dozens of distinct proteins (the exact number varies slightly between species). The ribosomal proteins and rRNAs are arranged into two distinct ribosomal pieces of different size, known generally as the large and small subunit of the ribosome. Ribosomes consist of two subunits that fit together (Figure 2) and work as one to translate the mRNA into a polypeptide chain during protein synthesis (Figure 1). Because they are formed from two subunits of non-equal size, they are slightly longer in the axis than in diameter.\n\n===Bacterial ribosomes===\nProkaryotic ribosomes are around 20&nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] (200&nbsp;[[\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m|\u00c5]]) in diameter and are composed of 65% rRNA and 35% [[ribosomal protein]]s.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Kurland CG |title=Molecular characterization of ribonucleic acid from Escherichia coli ribosomes|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=83\u201391|doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(60)80029-0|year=1960}}</ref> Eukaryotic ribosomes are between 25 and 30 [[Nanometre|nm]] (250\u2013300 \u00c5) in diameter with an rRNA-to-protein ratio that is close to 1.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson DN, Doudna Cate JH | title = The structure and function of the eukaryotic ribosome | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = a011536 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22550233 | pmc = 3331703 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a011536 }}</ref> [[Crystallography|Crystallographic]] work <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nissen P, Hansen J, Ban N, Moore PB, Steitz TA | title = The structural basis of ribosome activity in peptide bond synthesis | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5481 | pages = 920\u201330 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10937990 | doi = 10.1126/science.289.5481.920 | bibcode = 2000Sci...289..920N }}</ref> has shown that there are no ribosomal proteins close to the reaction site for polypeptide synthesis.

Whether the ribosome exists in a free or membrane-bound state depends on the presence of an [[signal peptide|ER-targeting signal sequence]] on the protein being synthesized, so an individual ribosome might be membrane-bound when it is making one protein, but free in the cytosol when it makes another protein.\n\nRibosomes are sometimes referred to as [[organelle]]s, but the use of the term ''organelle'' is often restricted to describing sub-cellular components that include a phospholipid membrane, which ribosomes, being entirely particulate, do not. For this reason, ribosomes may sometimes be described as \"non-membranous organelles\".\n\n===Free ribosomes===\nFree ribosomes can move about anywhere in the [[cytosol]], but are excluded from the [[cell nucleus]] and other organelles. Proteins that are formed from free ribosomes are released into the cytosol and used within the cell. Since the cytosol contains high concentrations of [[glutathione]] and is, therefore, a [[redox|reducing environment]], proteins containing [[disulfide bonds]], which are formed from oxidized cysteine residues, cannot be produced within it.also\n\n===Membrane-bound ribosomes===\nWhen a ribosome begins to synthesize proteins that are needed in some organelles, the ribosome making this protein can become \"membrane-bound\". In eukaryotic cells this happens in a region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called the \"rough ER\". The newly produced polypeptide chains are inserted directly into the ER by the ribosome undertaking [[vectorial synthesis]] and are then transported to their destinations, through the [[secretory pathway]]. Bound ribosomes usually produce proteins that are used within the plasma membrane or are expelled from the cell via ''[[exocytosis]]''.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Walter P | chapter = Membrane-bound Ribosomes Define the Rough ER | chapter-url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26841/#A2204 | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell | edition = 4th | location = New York | publisher = Garland Science | date = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-8153-4072-0 }}</ref>\n\n==Biogenesis==\n{{Main|Ribosome biogenesis}}\n\nIn bacterial cells, ribosomes are synthesized in the cytoplasm through the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of multiple ribosome gene [[operon]]s. In eukaryotes, the process takes place both in the cell cytoplasm and in the [[nucleolus]], which is a region within the [[cell nucleus]]. The assembly process involves the coordinated function of over 200 proteins in the synthesis and processing of the four rRNAs, as well as assembly of those rRNAs with the ribosomal proteins.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe ribosome may have first originated in an [[RNA world]], appearing as a self-replicating complex that only later evolved the ability to synthesize proteins when [[amino acid]]s began to appear.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Noller HF | title = Evolution of protein synthesis from an RNA world | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = a003681 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 20610545 | pmc = 3312679 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a003681 }}</ref> Studies suggest that ancient ribosomes constructed solely of [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] could have developed the ability to synthesize [[peptide bond]]s.<ref>{{cite book | vauthors = Dabbs ER | date = 1986 | title = Mutant studies on the prokaryotic ribosome. | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = New York }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Noller HF, Hoffarth V, Zimniak L | title = Unusual resistance of peptidyl transferase to protein extraction procedures | journal = Science | volume = 256 | issue = 5062 | pages = 1416\u20139 | date = June 1992 | pmid = 1604315 | doi = 10.1126/science.1604315 | bibcode = 1992Sci...256.1416N }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nomura M, Mizushima S, Ozaki M, Traub P, Lowry CV | title = Structure and function of ribosomes and their molecular components | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Biology | volume = 34 | issue =  | pages = 49\u201361 | year = 1969 | pmid = 4909519 | doi = 10.1101/sqb.1969.034.01.009 }}</ref> In addition, evidence strongly points to ancient ribosomes as self-replicating complexes, where the rRNA in the ribosomes had informational, structural, and catalytic purposes because it could have coded for [[Transfer RNA|tRNAs]] and proteins needed for ribosomal self-replication.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Root-Bernstein M, Root-Bernstein R | title = The ribosome as a missing link in the evolution of life | journal = Journal of Theoretical Biology | volume = 367 | issue =  | pages = 130\u2013158 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25500179 | doi = 10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.11.025 }}</ref> Hypothetical cellular organisms with self-replicating RNA but without DNA are called ribocytes (or ribocells).<ref name=\"Yarus\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Yarus M | title = Primordial genetics: phenotype of the ribocyte | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 36 | issue =  | pages = 125\u201351 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12429689 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.36.031902.105056 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | doi=10.1007/978-94-007-4899-6_3|chapter = The Origin of Virions and Virocells: The Escape Hypothesis Revisited|title = Viruses: Essential Agents of Life| pages=43\u201360|year = 2012|last1 = Forterre|first1 = Patrick| last2=Krupovic| first2=Mart| name-list-format = vanc | isbn=978-94-007-4898-9}}</ref>\n\nAs amino acids gradually appeared in the RNA world under prebiotic conditions,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Caetano-Anoll\u00e9s G, Seufferheld MJ | title = The coevolutionary roots of biochemistry and cellular organization challenge the RNA world paradigm | journal = Journal of Molecular Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 23 | issue = 1\u20132 | pages = 152\u201377 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23615203 | doi = 10.1159/000346551 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saladino R, Botta G, Pino S, Costanzo G, Di Mauro E | title = Genetics first or metabolism first?

The ribosomes and associated molecules are also known as the ''translational apparatus''.\n\n==Overview==\nThe sequence of [[DNA]] that encodes the sequence of the amino acids in a protein, is transcribed into a messenger RNA chain. Ribosomes bind to messenger RNAs and use its sequence for determining the correct sequence of amino acids to generate a given protein. Amino acids are selected and carried to the ribosome by [[transfer RNA|transfer RNA (tRNA)]] molecules, which enter the ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain via an anti-codon stem loop. For each coding triplet in the messenger RNA, there is a transfer RNA that matches and carries the correct amino acid for incorporating into a growing polypeptide chain. Once the protein is produced, it can then [[protein folding|fold]] to produce a functional three-dimensional structure.\n\nA ribosome is made from [[biomolecular complex|complexes]] of RNAs and proteins and is therefore a [[Ribonucleoprotein particle|ribonucleoprotein complex]]. Each ribosome is divided into two subunits:\n# a smaller subunit which binds to a larger subunit and the mRNA, and\n# a larger subunit which binds to the aminoacylated tRNAs and the smaller subunit.\nWhen a ribosome finishes reading an mRNA molecule, these two subunits split apart. Ribosomes are [[ribozyme|ribozymes]], because the [[Catalysis|catalytic]] [[peptidyl transferase]] activity that links amino acids together is performed by the ribosomal RNA. Ribosomes are often associated with the intracellular membranes that make up the [[endoplasmic reticulum#Rough endoplasmic reticulum|rough endoplasmic reticulum]].\n\nRibosomes from [[bacteria]], [[archaea]] and [[eukaryote|eukaryotes]] in the [[three-domain system]] resemble each other to a remarkable degree, evidence of a common origin. They differ in their size, sequence, structure, and the ratio of protein to RNA. The differences in structure allow some [[antibiotic|antibiotics]] to kill bacteria by inhibiting their ribosomes, while leaving human ribosomes unaffected. In all species, more than one ribosome may move along a single mRNA chain at one time (as a [[polysome]]), each \"reading\" its sequence and producing a corresponding protein molecule.\n\nThe [[mitochondrial ribosome|mitochondrial ribosomes]] of eukaryotic cells functionally resemble many features of those in bacteria, reflecting the likely evolutionary origin of mitochondria.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Benne R, Sloof P | title = Evolution of the mitochondrial protein synthetic machinery | journal = Bio Systems | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 51\u201368 | year = 1987 | pmid = 2446672 | doi = 10.1016/0303-2647(87)90006-2 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.stedwards.edu/chem/Chemistry/CHEM43/CHEM43/Ribosomes/Ribosome.HTML|title=Ribosomes|access-date=2011-04-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320163538/http://www.cs.stedwards.edu/chem/Chemistry/CHEM43/CHEM43/Ribosomes/Ribosome.HTML|archive-date=2009-03-20}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery==\nRibosomes were first observed in the mid-1950s by [[Romanian-American]] cell biologist [[George Emil Palade]], using an [[electron microscope]], as dense particles or granules.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Palade GE | title = A small particulate component of the cytoplasm | journal = The Journal of Biophysical and Biochemical Cytology | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 59\u201368 | date = January 1955 | pmid = 14381428 | pmc = 2223592 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.1.1.59 }}</ref> The term \"ribosome\" was proposed by scientist Richard B.

It is largely made up of specialized RNA known as [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) as well as dozens of distinct proteins (the exact number varies slightly between species). The ribosomal proteins and rRNAs are arranged into two distinct ribosomal pieces of different size, known generally as the large and small subunit of the ribosome. Ribosomes consist of two subunits that fit together (Figure 2) and work as one to translate the mRNA into a polypeptide chain during protein synthesis (Figure 1). Because they are formed from two subunits of non-equal size, they are slightly longer in the axis than in diameter.\n\n===Bacterial ribosomes===\nProkaryotic ribosomes are around 20&nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] (200&nbsp;[[\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m|\u00c5]]) in diameter and are composed of 65% rRNA and 35% [[ribosomal protein]]s.<ref>{{cite journal| vauthors = Kurland CG |title=Molecular characterization of ribonucleic acid from Escherichia coli ribosomes|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=2|issue=2|pages=83\u201391|doi=10.1016/s0022-2836(60)80029-0|year=1960}}</ref> Eukaryotic ribosomes are between 25 and 30 [[Nanometre|nm]] (250\u2013300 \u00c5) in diameter with an rRNA-to-protein ratio that is close to 1.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson DN, Doudna Cate JH | title = The structure and function of the eukaryotic ribosome | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = a011536 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22550233 | pmc = 3331703 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a011536 }}</ref> [[Crystallography|Crystallographic]] work <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Nissen P, Hansen J, Ban N, Moore PB, Steitz TA | title = The structural basis of ribosome activity in peptide bond synthesis | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = 5481 | pages = 920\u201330 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10937990 | doi = 10.1126/science.289.5481.920 | bibcode = 2000Sci...289..920N }}</ref> has shown that there are no ribosomal proteins close to the reaction site for polypeptide synthesis.

Proteins are needed for many cellular functions such as repairing damage or directing chemical processes. Ribosomes can be found floating within the cytoplasm or attached to the [[endoplasmic reticulum]]. Basically, their main function is to convert genetic code into an amino acid sequence and to build protein polymers from amino acid monomers. \n\nRibosomes act as catalysts in two extremely important biological processes called peptidyl transfer and peptidyl hydrolysis.<ref name=\"courses.lumenlearning.com\">{{cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-microbiology/chapter/specialized-internal-structures-of-prokaryotes/|title=Specialized Internal Structures of Prokaryotes {{!}} Boundless Microbiology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2018-09-27}}</ref> The \"PT center is responsible for producing protein bonds during protein elongation\".<ref name=\"courses.lumenlearning.com\"/>\n\n=== Translation ===\n{{Main|Translation (biology)}}\nRibosomes are the workplaces of [[protein biosynthesis]], the process of translating [[mRNA]] into [[protein]].

Whether the ribosome exists in a free or membrane-bound state depends on the presence of an [[signal peptide|ER-targeting signal sequence]] on the protein being synthesized, so an individual ribosome might be membrane-bound when it is making one protein, but free in the cytosol when it makes another protein.\n\nRibosomes are sometimes referred to as [[organelle]]s, but the use of the term ''organelle'' is often restricted to describing sub-cellular components that include a phospholipid membrane, which ribosomes, being entirely particulate, do not. For this reason, ribosomes may sometimes be described as \"non-membranous organelles\".\n\n===Free ribosomes===\nFree ribosomes can move about anywhere in the [[cytosol]], but are excluded from the [[cell nucleus]] and other organelles. Proteins that are formed from free ribosomes are released into the cytosol and used within the cell. Since the cytosol contains high concentrations of [[glutathione]] and is, therefore, a [[redox|reducing environment]], proteins containing [[disulfide bonds]], which are formed from oxidized cysteine residues, cannot be produced within it.also\n\n===Membrane-bound ribosomes===\nWhen a ribosome begins to synthesize proteins that are needed in some organelles, the ribosome making this protein can become \"membrane-bound\". In eukaryotic cells this happens in a region of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) called the \"rough ER\". The newly produced polypeptide chains are inserted directly into the ER by the ribosome undertaking [[vectorial synthesis]] and are then transported to their destinations, through the [[secretory pathway]].
