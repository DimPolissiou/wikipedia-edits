Six matches were played between 3 January and 7 March. It was contested by [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]].\n\nThe 1891 Championship was won by Scotland, the fourth time the country had topped the table, but the first time Scotland had taken the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] title.\n\nRule changes this year, included the introduction of penalty goals, as although penalty kicks were introduced in 1882 no goal attempts could be made from one until this season. The two umpires were renamed as touch-judges and their powers were reduced to mark the spot where the ball left the field of play; a status that remained until additional powers were reinstated in 1982.<ref name=\"Godwin27\">Godwin (1984), pg 27.</ref> Players could now pick up a dead ball, and the dead ball line was set at a maximum of 25 yards.<ref name=\"Godwin27\"/>\n\n==Table==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2 width=\"8%\"| Position\n!rowspan=2 width=\"18%\"| Nation\n!colspan=4 width=\"32%\"| Games\n!colspan=3 width=\"32%\"| Points\n!rowspan=2 width=\"10%\"| Table<br/>points\n|-\n!width=\"8%\"| Played \n!width=\"8%\"| Won \n!width=\"8%\"| Drawn \n!width=\"8%\"| Lost \n!width=\"8%\"| For \n!width=\"8%\"| Against \n!width=\"8%\"| Difference\n|- bgcolor=#ccffcc\n|1||align=left|{{Ru|SCO}}\n||3||3||0||0||38||3||+35||'''6'''\n|- \n|2||align=left|{{Ru|ENG}}\n||3||2||0||1||19||12||+7||'''4'''\n|-\n|3||align=left|{{Ru|WAL}}\n||3||1||0||2||9||26||&minus;17||'''2'''\n|-\n|4||align=left| {{Ru|IRE}} \n||3||0||0||3||4||29||&minus;25||'''0'''\n|-\n|}\n\n==Results==\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 3 January 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|WAL}} | \nscore = 3&ndash;7|\naway = {{Ru|ENG}} |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] |\nattendance = }}\n\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 7 February 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|IRE}}  | \nscore = 0&ndash;9|\naway = {{Ru|ENG}} |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Dublin]] |\nattendance = }}\n\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 7 February 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|SCO}} | \nscore = 15&ndash;0|\naway = {{Ru|WAL}} |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Edinburgh]] |\nattendance = }}\n\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 21 February 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|IRE}}  | \nscore = 0&ndash;14|\naway = {{Ru|SCO}} |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Belfast]] |\nattendance = }}\n\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 7 March 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|WAL}} | \nscore = 6&ndash;4|\naway = {{Ru|IRE}}  |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Llanelli]] |\nattendance = }}\n\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 7 March 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|ENG}} | \nscore = 3&ndash;9|\naway = {{Ru|SCO}} |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Richmond F.

Six matches were played between 3 January and 7 March. It was contested by [[England national rugby union team|England]], [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]], [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] and [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]].\n\nThe 1891 Championship was won by Scotland, the fourth time the country had topped the table, but the first time Scotland had taken the [[Triple Crown (rugby union)|Triple Crown]] title.\n\nRule changes this year, included the introduction of penalty goals, as although penalty kicks were introduced in 1882 no goal attempts could be made from one until this season. The two umpires were renamed as touch-judges and their powers were reduced to mark the spot where the ball left the field of play; a status that remained until additional powers were reinstated in 1982.<ref name=\"Godwin27\">Godwin (1984), pg 27.</ref> Players could now pick up a dead ball, and the dead ball line was set at a maximum of 25 yards.<ref name=\"Godwin27\"/>\n\n==Table==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=2 width=\"8%\"| Position\n!rowspan=2 width=\"18%\"| Nation\n!colspan=4 width=\"32%\"| Games\n!colspan=3 width=\"32%\"| Points\n!rowspan=2 width=\"10%\"| Table<br/>points\n|-\n!width=\"8%\"| Played \n!width=\"8%\"| Won \n!width=\"8%\"| Drawn \n!width=\"8%\"| Lost \n!width=\"8%\"| For \n!width=\"8%\"| Against \n!width=\"8%\"| Difference\n|- bgcolor=#ccffcc\n|1||align=left|{{Ru|SCO}}\n||3||3||0||0||38||3||+35||'''6'''\n|- \n|2||align=left|{{Ru|ENG}}\n||3||2||0||1||19||12||+7||'''4'''\n|-\n|3||align=left|{{Ru|WAL}}\n||3||1||0||2||9||26||&minus;17||'''2'''\n|-\n|4||align=left| {{Ru|IRE}} \n||3||0||0||3||4||29||&minus;25||'''0'''\n|-\n|}\n\n==Results==\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 3 January 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|WAL}} | \nscore = 3&ndash;7|\naway = {{Ru|ENG}} |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Newport, Wales|Newport]] |\nattendance = }}\n\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 7 February 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|IRE}}  | \nscore = 0&ndash;9|\naway = {{Ru|ENG}} |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Dublin]] |\nattendance = }}\n\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 7 February 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|SCO}} | \nscore = 15&ndash;0|\naway = {{Ru|WAL}} |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Edinburgh]] |\nattendance = }}\n\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 21 February 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|IRE}}  | \nscore = 0&ndash;14|\naway = {{Ru|SCO}} |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Belfast]] |\nattendance = }}\n\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 7 March 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|WAL}} | \nscore = 6&ndash;4|\naway = {{Ru|IRE}}  |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Llanelli]] |\nattendance = }}\n\n{{Rugbybox |\ndate = 7 March 1891|\nhome = {{Ru-rt|ENG}} | \nscore = 3&ndash;9|\naway = {{Ru|SCO}} |  \nhomescore = | \nawayscore =  | \nstadium = [[Richmond F.

{"title_page": "Foreign relations of Trinidad and Tobago", "text_new": "{{Politics of Trinidad and Tobago}}\n\nModern '''[[Trinidad and Tobago]]''' maintains close relations with its [[Caribbean]] neighbours and major North American and European trading partners. As the most industrialized and second-largest country in the English-speaking Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago has taken a leading role in the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), and strongly supports CARICOM economic integration efforts. It also is active in the [[Summit of the Americas]] process and supports the establishment of the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]], lobbying other nations for seating the Secretariat in [[Port of Spain]].\n\nAs a member of CARICOM, Trinidad and Tobago strongly backed efforts by the [[United States]] to bring political stability to [[Haiti]], contributing personnel to the Multinational Force in 1994. After its 1962 independence, Trinidad and Tobago joined the [[United Nations]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. In 1967, it became the first Commonwealth country to join the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS). In 1995, Trinidad played host to the inaugural meeting of the [[Association of Caribbean States]] and has become the seat of this 35-member grouping, which seeks to further economic progress and integration among its states.\n\nIn international forums, Trinidad and Tobago has defined itself as having an independent voting record, but often supports U.S. and [[European Union|EU]] positions.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago has historically been a trans-shipment point for [[South America]]n drugs destined for the United States and [[Europe]]. This has created much tension in the country's politics.\n\nTrinidad and Tobago is also a member-state of the [[International Criminal Court]], without a Bilateral Immunity Agreement of protection for the [[U.S. military]] (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]])\n\n==Trinidad and Tobago and the Commonwealth of Nations==\n\nTrinidad and Tobago became an independent state in 1962 with [[Queen Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Trinidad and Tobago]]. She was represented by the [[Governor-General of Trinidad and Tobago]].\n\nIn 1976, Trinidad and Tobago became a [[Commonwealth republic]] with the last Governor-General, Sir [[Ellis Clarke]] becoming the first [[President of Trinidad and Tobago]].\n\n==Bilateral relations==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:12%;\"| Formal Relations Began\n!Notes\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Australia }}||<!--Date started-->7 January 1974||See [[Australia\u2013Trinidad and Tobago relations]]\n\n* Australia has a high commission in [[Port of Spain]].\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Barbados}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Barbados\u2013Trinidad and Tobago relations]]\n\n* Barbados maintains non-resident representation to Port of Spain.\n* Trinidad and Tobago maintains non-resident representation to [[Bridgetown]].\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Belize}}||<!--Date started-->21 September 1981||\n*Both countries established diplomatic relations on September 21, 1981.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.bz/images/documents/DIPLOMATIC%20RELATIONS.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230194831/http://www.mfa.gov.bz/images/documents/DIPLOMATIC%20RELATIONS.pdf |archive-date=2017-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n*Both countries are full members of the [[Organization of American States]] and of the [[Caribbean Community]].\n\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|{{flag|Brazil}}||<!--Date started-->||See [[Brazil-Trinidad and Tobago relations]]\nBrazil and Trinidad and Tobago enjoy a cordial and active relation.

In 1933, states Jos\u00e9 Luiz Martinez \u2013 a professor of Music, Stern refined this explanation to \"the ''r\u0101ga'' is more fixed than mode, less fixed than the melody, beyond the mode and short of melody, and richer both than a given mode or a given melody; it is mode with added multiple specialities\".{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' is a central concept of Indian music, predominant in its expression, yet the concept has no direct Western translation. According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of ''r\u0101ga'' cannot be offered in one or two sentences.{{Sfn|Kaufmann|1968|p=v}} ''r\u0101ga'' is a fusion of technical and ideational ideas found in music, and may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, in a manner similar to how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}} In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in others optional. The ''r\u0101ga'' allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' has a given set of notes, on a scale, ordered in melodies with musical motifs.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} A musician playing a ''r\u0101ga'', states [[Bruno Nettl]], may traditionally use just these notes, but is free to emphasize or improvise certain degrees of the scale.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} The Indian tradition suggests a certain sequencing of how the musician moves from note to note for each ''r\u0101ga'', in order for the performance to create a ''rasa'' (mood, atmosphere, essence, inner feeling) that is unique to each ''r\u0101ga''. A ''r\u0101ga'' can be written on a scale. Theoretically, thousands of ''r\u0101ga'' are possible given 5 or more notes, but in practical use, the classical tradition has refined and typically relies on several hundred.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} For most artists, their basic perfected repertoire has some forty to fifty ''r\u0101gas''.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|p=5}} ''R\u0101ga'' in Indian classic music is intimately related to ''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'' or guidance about \"division of time\", with each unit called a ''matra'' (beat, and duration between beats).{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=6\u20138}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' is not a tune, because the same ''r\u0101ga'' can yield an infinite number of tunes.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} A ''r\u0101ga'' is not a scale, because many ''r\u0101gas'' can be based on the same scale.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}}{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}} A ''r\u0101ga'', according to Bruno Nettl and other music scholars, is a concept similar to a mode, something between the domains of tune and scale, and it is best conceptualized as a \"unique array of melodic features, mapped to and organized for a unique aesthetic sentiment in the listener\".{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} The goal of a ''r\u0101ga'' and its artist is to create ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' (essence, feeling, atmosphere) with music, as [[classical Indian dance]] does with performance arts.

He associated pure and simple ''r\u0101gas'' to early morning, mixed and more complex ''r\u0101gas'' to late morning, skillful ''r\u0101gas'' to noon, love-themed and passionate ''r\u0101gas'' to evening, and universal ''r\u0101gas'' to night.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=36\u201338}}\n\n===R\u0101ga and mathematics===\nAccording to Cris Forster, mathematical studies on systematizing and analyzing South Indian ''r\u0101ga'' began in the 16th century.{{Sfn|Forster|2010|pp= 564\u2013565; [http://www.chrysalis-foundation.org/Ramamatya-s_Vina.htm Quote]: \"In the next five sections, we will examine the evolution of South Indian ragas in the writings of Ramamatya (fl. c. 1550), Venkatamakhi (fl. c. 1620), and Govinda (c. 1800).

Ramamatya was the first Indian theorist to formulate a system based on a mathematically determined tuning. He defined (1) a theoretical 14-tone scale, (2) a practical 12-tone tuning, and (3) a distinction between abstract mela ragas and musical janya ragas.

Some janya r\u0101gas are ''[[Abheri]]'', ''[[Abhogi]]'', ''[[Bhairavi (Carnatic)|Bhairavi]]'', ''[[Hindolam]]'', ''[[Mohanam]]'' and ''[[Kambhoji]]''.<ref name=\"raganidhi\" /><ref name=\"ragas\" />\n\nList of Janaka Ragas are ''[[Kanakangi]]'', ''[[Ratnangi]]'', Ganamurthi, ''[[Vanaspathi]]'', ''[[Manavathi]]'', Thanarupi, Senavathi, ''[[Hanumatodi]]'', ''[[Dhenuka]]'',  ''[[Natakapriya]]'', ''[[Kokilapriya]]'', ''[[Rupavati]]'', ''[[Gayakapriya]]'', ''[[Vakulabharanam]]'', ''[[Mayamalavagowla]]'', ''[[Chakravakam]]'', ''[[Suryakantam]]'', ''[[Hatakambari]]'', ''[[Jhankaradhvani]]'', ''[[Natabhairavi]]'', ''[[Keeravani]]'', ''[[Kharaharapriya]]'', ''[[Gourimanohari]]'', ''[[Varunapriya]]'', ''[[Mararanjani]]'', ''[[Charukesi]]'', ''[[Sarasangi]]'', ''[[Harikambhoji]]'', ''[[Dheerashankarabharanam]]'', ''[[Naganandini]]'', ''[[Yagapriya]]'', ''[[Ragavardhini]]'', ''[[Gangeyabhushani]]'', ''[[Vagadheeswari]]'', ''[[Shulini]]'', ''[[Chalanata]]'', ''[[Salagam]]'', ''[[Jalarnavam]]'', ''[[Jhalavarali]]'',''[[Navaneetam]]'',''[[Pavani (raga)|Pavani]]'',\n\n==Training==\nClassical music has been transmitted through music schools or through [[Guru]]-Shishya ''parampara'' (teacher-student tradition) through an [[oral tradition]] and practice. Some are known as ''[[gharana]]'' (houses), and their performances are staged through ''sabhas'' (music organizations).{{Sfn|Tenzer|2006|pp=303\u2013309}}<ref>Sanyukta Kashalkar-Karve (2013), \"Comparative Study of Ancient Gurukul System and the New Trends of Guru-Shishya Parampara,\" American International Journal of Research in Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, Volume 2, Number 1, pages 81\u201384</ref> Each ''gharana'' has freely improvised over time, and differences in the rendering of each ''r\u0101ga'' is discernible. In the Indian musical schooling tradition, the small group of students lived near or with the teacher, the teacher treated them as family members providing food and boarding, and a student learnt various aspects of music thereby continuing the musical knowledge of his [[guru]].{{Sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|pp=457\u2013467}} The tradition survives in parts of India, and many musicians can trace their guru lineage.{{Sfn|Ries|1969|p=22}}\n\n==Persian R\u0101k==\nThe music concept of ''R\u0101k'' in Persian is probably a pronunciation of ''r\u0101ga''.

In 1933, states Jos\u00e9 Luiz Martinez \u2013 a professor of Music, Stern refined this explanation to \"the ''r\u0101ga'' is more fixed than mode, less fixed than the melody, beyond the mode and short of melody, and richer both than a given mode or a given melody; it is mode with added multiple specialities\".{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' is a central concept of Indian music, predominant in its expression, yet the concept has no direct Western translation. According to Walter Kaufmann, though a remarkable and prominent feature of Indian music, a definition of ''r\u0101ga'' cannot be offered in one or two sentences.{{Sfn|Kaufmann|1968|p=v}} ''r\u0101ga'' is a fusion of technical and ideational ideas found in music, and may be roughly described as a musical entity that includes note intonation, relative duration and order, in a manner similar to how words flexibly form phrases to create an atmosphere of expression.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}} In some cases, certain rules are considered obligatory, in others optional. The ''r\u0101ga'' allows flexibility, where the artist may rely on simple expression, or may add ornamentations yet express the same essential message but evoke a different intensity of mood.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' has a given set of notes, on a scale, ordered in melodies with musical motifs.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} A musician playing a ''r\u0101ga'', states [[Bruno Nettl]], may traditionally use just these notes, but is free to emphasize or improvise certain degrees of the scale.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} The Indian tradition suggests a certain sequencing of how the musician moves from note to note for each ''r\u0101ga'', in order for the performance to create a ''rasa'' (mood, atmosphere, essence, inner feeling) that is unique to each ''r\u0101ga''. A ''r\u0101ga'' can be written on a scale. Theoretically, thousands of ''r\u0101ga'' are possible given 5 or more notes, but in practical use, the classical tradition has refined and typically relies on several hundred.{{Sfn|Nettl|2010}} For most artists, their basic perfected repertoire has some forty to fifty ''r\u0101gas''.{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|p=5}} ''R\u0101ga'' in Indian classic music is intimately related to ''[[Tala (music)|tala]]'' or guidance about \"division of time\", with each unit called a ''matra'' (beat, and duration between beats).{{Sfn|van der Meer|2012|pp=6\u20138}}\n\nA ''r\u0101ga'' is not a tune, because the same ''r\u0101ga'' can yield an infinite number of tunes.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} A ''r\u0101ga'' is not a scale, because many ''r\u0101gas'' can be based on the same scale.{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}}{{Sfn|Martinez|2001|pp=95\u201396}} A ''r\u0101ga'', according to Bruno Nettl and other music scholars, is a concept similar to a mode, something between the domains of tune and scale, and it is best conceptualized as a \"unique array of melodic features, mapped to and organized for a unique aesthetic sentiment in the listener\".{{sfn|Nettl et al.|1998|p=67}} The goal of a ''r\u0101ga'' and its artist is to create ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasa]]'' (essence, feeling, atmosphere) with music, as [[classical Indian dance]] does with performance arts.

The North Indian system suggests a particular time of a day or a season, in the belief that the human state of psyche and mind are affected by the seasons and by daily biological cycles and nature's rhythms. The South Indian system is closer to the text, and places less emphasis on time or season.{{Sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|pp=17\u201323}}{{Sfn|Randel|2003|pp=813\u201321}}\n\nThe symbolic role of classical music through ''r\u0101ga'' has been both aesthetic indulgence and the spiritual purifying of one's mind (yoga). The former is encouraged in [[Kama]] literature (such as ''Kamasutra''), while the latter appears in [[Yoga]] literature with concepts such as \"Nada-Brahman\" (metaphysical [[Brahman]] of sound).{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=35\u201336}}<ref name=\"Nietupski2011p59\"/>{{Sfn|Sastri|1943|p=xxii, Quote: \"[In ancient Indian culture], the musical notes are the physical manifestations of the Highest Reality termed Nada-Brahman. Music is not a mere accompaniment in religious worship, it is religious worship itself\".}} ''[[Hindola raga|Hindola r\u0101ga]]'', for example, is considered a manifestation of Kama (god of love), typically through [[Krishna]]. ''Hindola'' is also linked to the festival of ''dola'',{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=35\u201336}} which is more commonly known as \"spring festival of colors\" or [[Holi]]. This idea of aesthetic symbolism has also been expressed in [[Hindu temple]] reliefs and carvings, as well as painting collections such as the [[Ragamala paintings|ragamala]].<ref name=\"Nietupski2011p59\">{{cite book|author1=Paul Kocot Nietupski|author2=Joan O'Mara|title=Reading Asian Art and Artifacts: Windows to Asia on American College Campuses |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnLA10fJw88C&pg=PA59 |year=2011|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-1-61146-070-4|page=59}}</ref>\n\nIn ancient and medieval Indian literature, the ''r\u0101ga'' are described as manifestation and symbolism for gods and goddesses. Music is discussed as equivalent to the ritual ''[[yajna]]'' sacrifice, with pentatonic and hexatonic notes such as ''\"ni-dha-pa-ma-ga-ri\"'' as [[Agnistoma]], ''\"ri-ni-dha-pa-ma-ga'' as [[Asvamedha]], and so on.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=35\u201336}}\n\nIn the Middle Ages, music scholars of India began associating each ''r\u0101ga'' with seasons. The 11th century Nanyadeva, for example, recommends that ''Hindola r\u0101ga'' is best in spring, ''Pancama'' in summer, ''Sadjagrama'' and ''Takka'' during the monsoons, ''Bhinnasadja'' is best in early winter, and ''Kaisika'' in late winter.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|p=36}} In the 13th century, Sarngadeva went further and associated ''r\u0101ga'' with rhythms of each day and night. He associated pure and simple ''r\u0101gas'' to early morning, mixed and more complex ''r\u0101gas'' to late morning, skillful ''r\u0101gas'' to noon, love-themed and passionate ''r\u0101gas'' to evening, and universal ''r\u0101gas'' to night.{{Sfn|Te Nijenhuis|1974|pp=36\u201338}}\n\n===R\u0101ga and mathematics===\nAccording to Cris Forster, mathematical studies on systematizing and analyzing South Indian ''r\u0101ga'' began in the 16th century.{{Sfn|Forster|2010|pp= 564\u2013565; [http://www.chrysalis-foundation.org/Ramamatya-s_Vina.htm Quote]: \"In the next five sections, we will examine the evolution of South Indian ragas in the writings of Ramamatya (fl. c. 1550), Venkatamakhi (fl. c. 1620), and Govinda (c. 1800). These three writers focused on a theme common to all organizational systems, namely, the principle of abstraction. Ramamatya was the first Indian theorist to formulate a system based on a mathematically determined tuning. He defined (1) a theoretical 14-tone scale, (2) a practical 12-tone tuning, and (3) a distinction between abstract mela ragas and musical janya ragas. He then combined these three concepts to identify 20 mela ragas, under which he classified more than 60 janya ragas.
