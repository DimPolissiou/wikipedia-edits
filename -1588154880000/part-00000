On 5&nbsp;April, the British government dispatched a [[British naval forces in the Falklands War|naval task force]] to engage the [[Argentine Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]] before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74&nbsp;days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14&nbsp;June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649&nbsp;Argentine military personnel, 255&nbsp;British military personnel, and three [[Falkland Islanders]]<!-- Please don't change these figures without discussing in talk. Thanks. --> died during the hostilities.\n\nThe conflict was a major episode in the [[History of the Falkland Islands|protracted dispute]] over the territories' [[sovereignty]]. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalturk.com/en/argentina-to-reaffirm-sovereignty-rights-over-the-falkland-islands-15712 |title= Argentine to reaffirm Sovereignty Rights over The Falkland Islands |publisher= National Turk |accessdate=7 January 2012|date= 4 January 2012 }}</ref> and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a [[Crown colony]] since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th&nbsp;century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly [[1986 Falkland Islands status referendum|favour British sovereignty]]. Neither state officially [[Declaration of war|declared war]], although both governments declared the Islands a war zone. \n\nThe conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various [[Cultural impact of the Falklands War|books, articles, films, and songs]]. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the outcome prompted large protests against the [[National Reorganization Process|ruling military government]], hastening its downfall and the [[1983 Argentine general election|democratization of the country]]. In the United Kingdom, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, bolstered by the successful outcome, [[1983 United Kingdom general election|was re-elected with an increased majority the following year]]. The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it remains a common topic for discussion.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/2007/04/01/z-03415.htm |title=C\u00f3mo evitar que Londres convierta a las Malvinas en un Estado independiente |publisher= Clarin |accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nDiplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in [[Madrid]], at which the two governments issued a joint statement.<ref>{{cite web |title= Joint statement of 19 October 1989: Re-establishing Consular Relations Between Britain and Argentina, and Agreeing a Framework on Sovereignty Which Would Allow Further Talks |url= http://www.falklands.info/history/1989agreement.html |website= Falklands info |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120517012555/http://falklands.info/history/1989agreement.html |archive-date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> No change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit.

The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) regarded the islands as a nuisance and barrier to UK trade in South America, so, whilst confident of British sovereignty, was prepared to cede the islands to Argentina.  When news of a proposed transfer broke in 1968, elements sympathetic with the plight of the islanders were able to organise an effective Parliamentary lobby to frustrate the FCO plans.  Negotiations continued but in general failed to make meaningful progress; the islanders steadfastly refused to consider Argentine sovereignty on one side, whilst Argentina would not compromise over sovereignty on the other.<ref name=\"Welch\">{{cite book |last1=Welch |first1=David A. |title=Painful Choices: A Theory of Foreign Policy Change |date=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Google Books |isbn=9781400840748 |pages=75 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k6VJbfckQAkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Painful+Choices:+A+Theory+of+Foreign+Policy+Change#v=onepage&q=Painful%20Choices%3A%20A%20Theory%20of%20Foreign%20Policy%20Change&f=false |accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref> The FCO then sought to make the islands dependent on Argentina, hoping this would make the islanders more amenable to Argentine sovereignty. A Communications Agreement signed in 1971 created an airlink and later YPF the Argentine oil company was given a monopoly in the islands.  In 1980, a new [[Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (United Kingdom)|Minister of State for Foreign Affairs]], [[Nick Ridley]], went to the Falklands trying to sell the islanders the benefits of a [[leaseback]] scheme, which met with strong opposition from the islanders. On returning to London in December 1980 he reported to parliament but was viciously attacked at what was seen as a sellout.  (It was unlikely that leaseback could have succeeded since the British had sought a long term lease of 99 years, whilst Argentina was pressing for a much shorter period of only 10 years.) At a private committee meeting that evening, it was reported that Ridley cried out: \"If we don't do something, they will invade.

The Royal Navy ice patrol vessel {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}} was dispatched from Stanley to South Georgia on the 25th in response.

The longest and only paved runway was at the capital, [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], and even that was too short to support fast jets (although an [[Arresting gear|arrestor gear]] was fitted in April to support Skyhawks). Therefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, [[combat air patrol]]s, and [[close air support]] over the islands. The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low, and they were later compelled to overfly British forces in any attempt to attack the islands.\n\nThe first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft ([[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawks]], [[IAI Nesher|IAI Daggers]], [[English Electric Canberra]]s, and [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] escorts), and was sent on 1 May, in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place. Only a section of Grupo 6 (flying IAI Dagger aircraft) found ships, which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands. The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely. This greatly boosted morale of the Argentine pilots, who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships, protected by radar ground clutter from the islands and by using a late [[Toss bombing|pop up]] profile. Meanwhile, other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by [[BAE Sea Harrier]]s operating from {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}.

One was shot down by an [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9L Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]] (AAM), while the other escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its mainland air base.

The decoying would be later extended with the formation of the [[Escuadr\u00f3n F\u00e9nix]], a squadron of civilian jets flying 24 hours a day, simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the fleet.

The first naval loss was the [[Second World War]]-vintage Argentine [[light cruiser]] {{ship|ARA|General Belgrano}}. The [[nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]] {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} sank ''General Belgrano'' on 2 May. Three hundred and twenty-three members of ''General Belgrano''{{'}}s crew died in the incident. More than 700 men were rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather. The losses from ''General Belgrano'' totalled nearly half of the Argentine deaths in the Falklands conflict, and the loss of the ship hardened the stance of the Argentine government.\n\nRegardless of [[ARA General Belgrano#Controversy over the sinking|controversies over the sinking]]\u2014including disagreement about the exact nature of the maritime exclusion zone and whether ''General Belgrano'' had been returning to port at the time of the sinking\u2014it had a crucial strategic effect: the elimination of the Argentine naval threat. After her loss, the entire Argentine fleet, with the exception of the diesel-powered submarine {{ship|ARA|San Luis|S-32|6}},<ref name=\"handle.dtic.mil\"/> returned to port and did not leave again during the fighting. The two escorting [[destroyer]]s and the battle group centred on the aircraft carrier {{ship|ARA|Veinticinco de Mayo|V-2|6}} both withdrew from the area, ending the direct threat to the British fleet that their [[pincer movement]] had represented.\n\nHowever, settling the controversy in 2003, the ship's captain Hector Bonzo confirmed that ''General Belgrano'' had actually been manoeuvering, not \"sailing away\" from the exclusion zone, and had orders to sink \"any British ship he could find\". Further, Captain Bonzo stated that any suggestion that HMS ''Conqueror''{{'s}} actions were a \"betrayal\" was utterly wrong; rather, the submarine carried out its duties according to the accepted rules of war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/may/25/uk.world|website=[[The Guardian]]|title=Belgrano crew 'trigger happy'|author=Peter Beaumont|date=25 May 2003|accessdate=20 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn a separate incident later that night, British forces engaged an Argentine patrol gunboat, the {{ship|ARA|Alferez Sobral|A-9|6}}, that was searching for the crew of the Argentine Air Force Canberra light bomber shot down on 1 May. Two Royal Navy [[Westland Lynx|Lynx]] helicopters fired four [[Sea Skua]] missiles at her. Badly damaged and with eight crew dead, ''Alferez Sobral'' managed to return to [[Puerto Deseado]] two days later. The Canberra's crew were never found.\n\n=== Sinking of HMS ''Sheffield'' ===\n[[File:HMS Sheffield (D80).jpg|thumb|HMS ''Sheffield'']]\nOn 4 May, two days after the sinking of ''General Belgrano'', the British lost the [[Type 42 destroyer]] {{HMS|Sheffield|D80|6}} to fire following an [[Exocet]] missile strike from the Argentine [[2da Escuadrilla Aeronaval de Caza y Ataque|2nd Naval Air Fighter/Attack Squadron]].\n\n''Sheffield'' had been ordered forward with two other Type 42s to provide a long-range radar and medium-high altitude missile [[picket (military)|picket]] far from the British carriers. She was struck amidships, with devastating effect, ultimately killing 20 crew members and severely injuring 24 others. The ship was abandoned several hours later, gutted and deformed by the fires that continued to burn for six more days. She finally sank outside the [[Total Exclusion Zone|Maritime Exclusion Zone]] on 10 May. \n\nThe incident is described in detail by Admiral [[Sandy Woodward]] in his book ''One Hundred Days'', in Chapter One. Woodward was a former commanding officer of ''Sheffield''.<ref>{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997|p=8}}</ref> The destruction of ''Sheffield'' (the first Royal Navy ship sunk in action since the Second World War) had a profound impact on the British public, bringing home the fact that the \"Falklands Crisis\", as the [[BBC News]] put it, was now an actual \"shooting war\".\n\n=== Diplomatic activity ===\nThe tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentines. The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary General [[P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] on 18 May 1982. In it, the British abandoned their previous \"red-line\" that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentine forces, as supported by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502]].\n\nInstead, it proposed a UN administrator should supervise the mutual withdrawal of both Argentine and British forces, then govern the islands in consultation with the representative institutions of the islands, including Argentines, although no Argentines lived there. Reference to \"[[self-determination]]\" of the islanders was dropped and the British proposed that future negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands should be conducted by the UN.<ref>[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography'' (2013) Volume 1, pp. 726\u2013728</ref>\n\n=== Special forces operations ===\nGiven the threat to the British fleet posed by the \u00c9tendard-Exocet combination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in some [[Special Air Service|SAS]] troops to attack the home base of the five \u00c9tendards at [[R\u00edo Grande, Tierra del Fuego]]. The operation was codenamed \"[[Operation Mikado|Mikado]]\". The operation was later scrapped, after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited, and replaced with a plan to use the submarine {{HMS|Onyx|S21|6}} to drop SAS operatives several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy Argentina's remaining Exocet stockpile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eliteukforces.info/articles/sas-versus-exocets.php#prof |title=The SAS vs the Exocet |publisher=eliteukforces.info |date=27 October 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn SAS reconnaissance team was dispatched to carry out preparations for a seaborne infiltration.

[[Rapier missile]] launchers were carried as underslung loads of [[Westland Sea King|Sea Kings]] for rapid deployment.\n\nBy dawn the next day, they had established a secure beachhead from which to conduct offensive operations. From there, [[Brigadier]] [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]]'s plan was to capture [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]] and [[Goose Green]] before turning towards Port Stanley. Now, with the British troops on the ground, the [[South Air Force]] (Argentina) began the night bombing campaign against them using [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bomber planes until the last day of the war (14 June).\n\n[[File:HMS Antelope 1982.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Antelope|F170|6}} smoking after being hit, 23 May]]\n[[File:HMS Coventry D118.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Coventry|D118|6}}]]\n\nAt sea, the paucity of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences was demonstrated in the sinking of {{HMS|Ardent|F184|6}} on 21 May, {{HMS|Antelope|F170|6}} on 24 May, and {{ship|MV|Atlantic Conveyor}} (struck by two AM39 Exocets) on 25 May along with a cargo of [[helicopter]]s, runway-building equipment and tents.

However, many British ships escaped being sunk because of weaknesses of the Argentine pilots' bombing tactics described below.\n\nTo avoid the highest concentration of British air defences, Argentine pilots released ordnance from very low altitude, and hence their bomb [[fuze]]s<!--For anyone tempted to correct the \"mis-spelling\", 'fuze' is a component of a bomb, 'fuse' is an electrical component, 'fuze' is correct in this instance --> did not have sufficient time to arm before impact. The low release of the [[retarded bomb]]s (some of which the British had sold to the Argentines years earlier) meant that many never exploded, as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves.\n\nA simple free-fall bomb in a low-altitude release impacts almost directly below the aircraft, which is then within the lethal fragmentation zone of the explosion. A retarded bomb has a small parachute or air brake that opens to reduce the speed of the bomb to produce a safe horizontal separation between the bomb and the aircraft. The <!--For anyone tempted to correct the \"mis-spelling\", 'fuze' is a component of a bomb, 'fuse' is an electrical component, 'fuze' is correct in this instance -->fuze for a retarded bomb requires that the retarder be open a minimum time to ensure safe separation. The pilots would have been aware of this\u2014but due to the high concentration required to avoid [[Surface-to-air missiles|SAMs]], [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] (AAA), and British [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]], many failed to climb to the necessary release point. The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised [[Gravity bomb|retarding devices]], allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on 8 June.\n\nIn his autobiographical account of the Falklands War, Admiral Woodward blamed the [[BBC World Service]] for disclosing information that led the Argentines to change the retarding devices on the bombs. The World Service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] official.

On 27 May, men of 45 Cdo and 3 Para started a [[loaded march]] across [[East Falkland]] towards the coastal settlement of [[Teal Inlet]].\n\n=== Special forces on Mount Kent ===\nMeanwhile, 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent.{{refn|Location: Mount Kent,\u2002Falkland Islands|group=nb}} Unknown to senior British officers, the Argentine generals were determined to tie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area, and on 27 and 28 May they sent transport aircraft loaded with [[Blowpipe (missile)|Blowpipe]] surface-to-air missiles and [[commando]]s (602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron) to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]. This operation was known as ''Autoimpuesta'' (\"Self-determination initiative\").\n\nFor the next week, the SAS and the [[Mountain Leader Training Cadre|Mountain and Arctic Warfare Cadre]] (M&AWC) of [[3 Commando Brigade]] waged intense patrol battles with patrols of the volunteers' 602nd Commando Company under Major [[Aldo Rico]], normally second in Command of the 22nd Mountain Infantry Regiment. Throughout 30 May, Royal Air Force Harriers were active over Mount Kent. One of them, Harrier ''XZ963'', flown by Squadron Leader Jerry Pook\u2014in responding to a call for help from D Squadron, attacked Mount Kent's eastern lower slopes, and that led to its loss through small-arms fire.

A 13-strong Argentine Army Commando detachment (Captain Jos\u00e9 Vercesi's 1st Assault Section, 602nd Commando Company) found itself trapped in a small shepherd's house at Top Malo. The Argentine commandos fired from windows and doorways and then took refuge in a stream bed {{convert|200|m|ft|-2}} from the burning house. Completely surrounded, they fought 19 M&AWC marines under Captain Rod Boswell for 45 minutes until, with their ammunition almost exhausted, they elected to surrender.\n\nThree Cadre members were badly wounded. On the Argentine side, there were two dead, including Lieutenant Ernesto Espinoza and Sergeant Mateo Sbert (who were posthumously decorated for their bravery). Only five Argentines were left unscathed. As the British mopped up Top Malo House, Lieutenant Fraser Haddow's M&AWC patrol came down from Malo Hill, brandishing a large [[Union Flag]]. One wounded Argentine soldier, Lieutenant Horacio Losito, commented that their escape route would have taken them through Haddow's position.\n\n601st Commando tried to move forward to rescue 602nd Commando Company on Estancia Mountain.

During this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 56. Of the dead, 32 were from the [[Welsh Guards]] on [[RFA Sir Galahad (1966)|RFA ''Sir Galahad'']] and [[RFA Sir Tristram (L3505)|RFA ''Sir Tristram'']] on 8 June. According to Surgeon-Commander [[Rick Jolly]] of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack, including, famously, [[Simon Weston]].<ref>Rick Jolly, ''The Red & Green Life Machine'', p. 124.</ref>\n\nThe Guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to Stanley. On 2 June, a small advance party of 2 Para moved to Swan Inlet house in a number of Army [[Westland Scout]] helicopters. Telephoning ahead to [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]], they discovered that the area was clear of Argentines and (exceeding their authority) commandeered the one remaining [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|RAF Chinook]] helicopter to frantically ferry another contingent of 2 Para ahead to Fitzroy (a settlement on Port Pleasant) and [[Bluff Cove]] (a settlement on Port Fitzroy).\n\n[[File:Stanley.falklands.war.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The road to Stanley]]\n\nThis uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the commanders of the combined operation, as they now found themselves with {{convert|30|mi|km}} of indefensible positions, strung along their southern flank. Support could not be sent by air as the single remaining Chinook was already heavily oversubscribed. The soldiers could march, but their equipment and heavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea.\n\nPlans were drawn up for half the Welsh Guards to march light on the night of 2 June, whilst the Scots Guards and the second half of the Welsh Guards were to be ferried from San Carlos Water in the [[Landing Ship Logistics]] (LSL) ''Sir Tristram'' and the [[amphibious transport dock|landing platform dock]] (LPD) ''Intrepid'' on the night of 5 June. ''Intrepid'' was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of ''Sir Tristram'' as possible, leaving the next evening for the relative safety of San Carlos. Escorts would be provided for this day, after which ''Sir Tristram'' would be left to unload using a [[Mexeflote]] (a powered raft) for as long as it took to finish.\n\nPolitical pressure from above to not risk the LPD forced Commodore Clapp to alter this plan. Two lower-value LSLs would be sent, but with no suitable beaches to land on, ''Intrepid''{{'}}s [[landing craft]] would need to accompany them to unload. A complicated operation across several nights with ''Intrepid'' and her sister ship {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} sailing half-way to dispatch their craft was devised.\n\nThe attempted overland march by half the Welsh Guards failed, possibly as they refused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment. They returned to San Carlos and landed directly at Bluff Cove when ''Fearless'' dispatched her landing craft. ''Sir Tristram'' sailed on the night of 6 June and was joined by ''Sir Galahad'' at dawn on 7 June. Anchored {{convert|1200|ft|m}} apart in Port Pleasant, the landing ships were near Fitzroy, the designated landing point.\n\nThe landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point relatively quickly, but confusion over the ordered disembarkation point (the first half of the Guards going direct to Bluff Cove) resulted in the senior Welsh Guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be ferried the far longer distance directly to Port Fitzroy/Bluff Cove. The alternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired Bluff Cove bridge (destroyed by retreating Argentine [[combat engineering|combat engineers]]) to their destination, a journey of around {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}}.\n\nOn ''Sir Galahad''{{'}}s stern ramp there was an argument about what to do. The officers on board were told that they could not sail to Bluff Cove that day. They were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as soon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft. It would take 20 minutes to transport the men to shore using the LCU and Mexeflote. They would then have the choice of walking the seven miles to Bluff Cove or wait until dark to sail there. The officers on board said that they would remain on board until dark and then sail. They refused to take their men off the ship. They possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on board ''Sir Galahad'' of the [[Royal Engineer]] Troop whose job it was to repair the bridge. The Welsh Guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their Battalion, who were potentially facing the enemy without their support. They had also not seen any enemy aircraft since landing at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] and may have been overconfident in the air defences. [[Ewen Southby-Tailyour]] gave a direct order for the men to leave the ship and go to the beach; the order was ignored.<ref name=\"SouthbyTailyour1990\">{{cite book|author=Ewen Southby-Tailyour|title=Reasons in Writing: A Commando's View of the Falklands War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0NWkAwAAQBAJ|date=31 December 1990|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-84415-014-4|page=297}} ''\"It was clear that I was achieving nothing and so, in desperation, I gave a direct order for the infantry to get ashore with or without their kit in order that we could get on with unloading Sir Tristram.<br /> The officers ignored my order. In doing so they explained to me quite clearly that no orders would be accepted from an officer of equivalent rank.\"''</ref>\n\nThe longer journey time of the landing craft taking the troops directly to Bluff Cove and the squabbling over how the landing was to be performed caused an enormous delay in unloading. This had disastrous consequences. Without escorts, having not yet established their air defence, and still almost fully laden, the two LSLs in Port Pleasant were sitting targets for two waves of Argentine [[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawks]].\n\nThe disaster at Port Pleasant (although often known as Bluff Cove) would provide the world with some of the most sobering images of the war as TV news video footage showed [[Royal Navy|Navy]] helicopters hovering in thick smoke to winch survivors from the burning landing ships.\n\nBritish casualties were 48 killed and 115 wounded.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/8/newsid_2500000/2500607.stm |work=BBC News|title=1982:Fifty die in Argentine air attack|date=8 June 1982 }}</ref> Three Argentine pilots were also killed.

Units of 3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships, simultaneously attacked in the [[Battle of Mount Harriet]], [[Battle of Two Sisters]], and [[Battle of Mount Longdon]]. Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers. At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy resistance and [[friendly fire]], but managed to capture their objectives. The toughest battle was at Mount Longdon. British forces were bogged down by rifle, mortar, machine gun, artillery fire, sniper fire, and ambushes. Despite this, the British continued their advance.\n\nDuring this battle, 13 were killed when {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}}, straying too close to shore while returning from the gun line, was struck by an improvised trailer-based [[Exocet]] MM38 launcher taken from the destroyer {{ship|ARA|Segu\u00ed|D-25|6}} by Argentine Navy technicians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fuerzasnavales.com/itb.html |title=An interview with CL (R) Ing.

''Almirante Irizar'' was an icebreaker, ''Bahia Paraiso'' was an Antarctic supply transport and ''Puerto Deseado'' was a survey ship. The British and Argentine vessels operating within the Box were in radio contact and there was some transfer of patients between the hospital ships. For example, the ''Uganda'' on four occasions transferred patients to an Argentine hospital ship. The British naval hospital ships operated as casualty ferries, carrying casualties from both sides from the Falklands to ''Uganda'' and operating a shuttle service between the Red Cross Box and [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]].\n\nThroughout the conflict officials of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding by the rules of the Geneva Conventions. On 12 June, some personnel were transferred from the Argentine hospital ship to the British ships by helicopter. Argentine naval officers also inspected the British casualty ferries in the estuary of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]].\n\n=== British casualty evacuation ===\n''Hydra'' worked with ''Hecla'' and ''Herald'' to take casualties from ''Uganda'' to Montevideo, Uruguay, where a fleet of Uruguayan ambulances met them.

The success of the Falklands campaign was widely regarded as a factor in the turnaround in fortunes for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, who had been trailing behind the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] in the opinion polls for months before the conflict began, but after the success in the Falklands the Conservatives returned to the top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win [[1983 United Kingdom general election|the following year's general election]] by a landslide.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm |title= 1983: Thatcher triumphs again |work=BBC News|accessdate=8 June 2010 | date=5 April 2005}}</ref> Subsequently, Defence Secretary Nott's proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were abandoned.\n\nThe islanders subsequently had full British citizenship restored in 1983, their lifestyle was improved by investments the UK made after the war and by the liberalisation of economic measures that had been stalled through fear of angering Argentina. In 1985, a [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands|new constitution]] was enacted promoting self-government, which has continued to devolve power to the islanders.\n\nIn Argentina, defeat in the Falklands War meant that a [[Beagle conflict|possible war with Chile]] was avoided. Further, Argentina returned to a democratic government in the [[1983 Argentine general election|1983 general election]], the first free general election since 1973. It also had a major social impact, destroying the military's image as the \"moral reserve of the nation\" that they had maintained through most of the 20th century.\n\nVarious figures have been produced for the number of veterans who have committed suicide since the war. Some studies have estimated that 264 British veterans and 350\u2013500 Argentine veterans have committed suicide since 1982.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Suicide after leaving the UK armed forces\u2014a cohort study|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000026 |year=2009|editor1-last=Hotopf|editor1-first=Matthew|last1=Kapur|first1=Navneet|last2=While|first2=David|last3=Blatchley|first3=Nick|last4=Bray|first4=Isabelle|last5=Harrison|first5=Kate|journal=PLOS Medicine|volume=6|issue=3|pages=e26|pmid=19260757|pmc=2650723}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.perfil.com/ediciones/2012/4/edicion_664/contenidos/noticia_0017.html |title=Edici\u00f3n Impresa &#124; Una fecha tr\u00e1gica de nuestra historia |publisher=Perfil.com |date=4 January 2012 |access-date=3 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501233745/http://www.perfil.com/ediciones/2012/4/edicion_664/contenidos/noticia_0017.html |archive-date=1 May 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> However, a detailed study<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/causes-of-deaths-among-the-uk-armed-forces-veterans-of-the-1982-falklands-campaign A study of deaths among UK Armed Forces personnel deployed to the 1982 Falklands Campaign: 1982 to 2012] published: 14 May 2013</ref> of {{formatnum:21432}} British veterans of the war commissioned by the UK Ministry of Defence found that only 95 had died from \"intentional self-harm and events of undetermined intent (suicides and open verdict deaths)\", a proportion lower than would be expected within the general population over the same period.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/defence-and-security-blog/2013/may/14/falklands-veterans-suicide-army |title=Falklands war: new study debunks claims of high suicide rates |work=The Guardian |accessdate=12 July 2013 | date=14 May 2013 |location=London |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor}}</ref>\n\n=== Military analysis ===\nMilitarily, the Falklands conflict remains one of the largest air-naval combat operations between modern forces since the end of the Second World War. As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians. The most significant \"lessons learned\" include: the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for a long-distance projection of power, and reconfirmation of the role of tactical air power, including the use of helicopters.\n\nIn 1986, the [[BBC]] broadcast the ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' programme, ''In the Wake of HMS Sheffield'', which discussed lessons learned from the conflict, and measures since taken to implement them, such as [[stealth ship]]s and [[close-in weapon system]]s.\n\n=== Memorials ===\n[[File:1982 Liberation Memorial in Stanley (5612271774).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[1982 Liberation Memorial]] in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]]]\nThere are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the [[1982 Liberation Memorial]], unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war.

Most military accidents took place while clearing the minefields in the immediate aftermath of the 1982 conflict or in the process of trying to establish the extent of the minefield perimeters, particularly where no detailed records existed.\n\nOn 9 May 2008, the Falkland Islands Government asserted that the minefields, which represent 0.1% of the available farmland on the islands \"present no long term social or economic difficulties for the Falklands,\" and that the impact of clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them.

It was a blatant lie for all those Argentine servicemen who had seen the Mirage being shot down by Argentine guns and had removed the dead pilot from the crashed aeroplane. Similarly, the junta's press office in Buenos Aires informed that Lieutenant Antonio Jukic, who actually was killed in his Pucar\u00e1 on the ground at Goose Green, had perished in a gallant, single-handed Pucar\u00e1 attack on HMS ''Hermes'', setting it on fire.

On 5&nbsp;April, the British government dispatched a [[British naval forces in the Falklands War|naval task force]] to engage the [[Argentine Navy]] and [[Argentine Air Force|Air Force]] before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74&nbsp;days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14&nbsp;June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649&nbsp;Argentine military personnel, 255&nbsp;British military personnel, and three [[Falkland Islanders]]<!-- Please don't change these figures without discussing in talk. Thanks. --> died during the hostilities.\n\nThe conflict was a major episode in the [[History of the Falkland Islands|protracted dispute]] over the territories' [[sovereignty]]. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalturk.com/en/argentina-to-reaffirm-sovereignty-rights-over-the-falkland-islands-15712 |title= Argentine to reaffirm Sovereignty Rights over The Falkland Islands |publisher= National Turk |accessdate=7 January 2012|date= 4 January 2012 }}</ref> and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a [[Crown colony]] since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th&nbsp;century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly [[1986 Falkland Islands status referendum|favour British sovereignty]]. Neither state officially [[Declaration of war|declared war]], although both governments declared the Islands a war zone. \n\nThe conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various [[Cultural impact of the Falklands War|books, articles, films, and songs]]. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the outcome prompted large protests against the [[National Reorganization Process|ruling military government]], hastening its downfall and the [[1983 Argentine general election|democratization of the country]]. In the United Kingdom, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, bolstered by the successful outcome, [[1983 United Kingdom general election|was re-elected with an increased majority the following year]]. The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it remains a common topic for discussion.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/zona/2007/04/01/z-03415.htm |title=C\u00f3mo evitar que Londres convierta a las Malvinas en un Estado independiente |publisher= Clarin |accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nDiplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in [[Madrid]], at which the two governments issued a joint statement.<ref>{{cite web |title= Joint statement of 19 October 1989: Re-establishing Consular Relations Between Britain and Argentina, and Agreeing a Framework on Sovereignty Which Would Allow Further Talks |url= http://www.falklands.info/history/1989agreement.html |website= Falklands info |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120517012555/http://falklands.info/history/1989agreement.html |archive-date=17 May 2012 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> No change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit.

The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) regarded the islands as a nuisance and barrier to UK trade in South America, so, whilst confident of British sovereignty, was prepared to cede the islands to Argentina.  When news of a proposed transfer broke in 1968, elements sympathetic with the plight of the islanders were able to organise an effective Parliamentary lobby to frustrate the FCO plans.  Negotiations continued but in general failed to make meaningful progress; the islanders steadfastly refused to consider Argentine sovereignty on one side, whilst Argentina would not compromise over sovereignty on the other.<ref name=\"Welch\">{{cite book |last1=Welch |first1=David A. |title=Painful Choices: A Theory of Foreign Policy Change |date=2011 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Google Books |isbn=9781400840748 |pages=75 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=k6VJbfckQAkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Painful+Choices:+A+Theory+of+Foreign+Policy+Change#v=onepage&q=Painful%20Choices%3A%20A%20Theory%20of%20Foreign%20Policy%20Change&f=false |accessdate=25 January 2020}}</ref> The FCO then sought to make the islands dependent on Argentina, hoping this would make the islanders more amenable to Argentine sovereignty. A Communications Agreement signed in 1971 created an airlink and later YPF the Argentine oil company was given a monopoly in the islands.  In 1980, a new [[Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (United Kingdom)|Minister of State for Foreign Affairs]], [[Nick Ridley]], went to the Falklands trying to sell the islanders the benefits of a [[leaseback]] scheme, which met with strong opposition from the islanders. On returning to London in December 1980 he reported to parliament but was viciously attacked at what was seen as a sellout.

All were embarked on {{ship|RFA|Tidespring|A75|6}}. First to arrive was the {{sclass-|Churchill|submarine}} HMS ''Conqueror'' on 19 April, and the island was over-flown by a radar-mapping [[Handley Page Victor]] on 20 April.\n\n[[File:USS Catfish;0833910.jpg|thumb|left|The {{ship|ARA|Santa Fe|S-21|6}} (as {{ship|USS|Catfish|SS-339|6}}) in 1956]]\n\nThe first landings of SAS troops took place on 21 April, but\u2014with the southern hemisphere autumn setting in\u2014the weather was so bad that their landings and others made the next day were all withdrawn after two helicopters crashed in fog on [[Fortuna Glacier]].

The Wasp from {{HMS|Plymouth|F126|6}} as well as two other Wasps launched from {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}} fired [[Aerospatiale SS.12/AS.12|AS-12]] [[Air-to-surface missile|ASM]] [[anti-ship missile|antiship missiles]] at the submarine, scoring hits. ''Santa Fe'' was damaged badly enough to prevent her from diving. The crew abandoned the submarine at the jetty at [[King Edward Point]] on South Georgia.\n\nWith ''Tidespring'' now far out to sea, and the Argentine forces augmented by the submarine's crew, Major Sheridan decided to gather the 76 men he had and make a direct assault that day.

The longest and only paved runway was at the capital, [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], and even that was too short to support fast jets (although an [[Arresting gear|arrestor gear]] was fitted in April to support Skyhawks). Therefore, the Argentines were forced to launch their major strikes from the mainland, severely hampering their efforts at forward staging, [[combat air patrol]]s, and [[close air support]] over the islands. The effective loiter time of incoming Argentine aircraft was low, and they were later compelled to overfly British forces in any attempt to attack the islands.\n\nThe first major Argentine strike force comprised 36 aircraft ([[Douglas A-4 Skyhawk|A-4 Skyhawks]], [[IAI Nesher|IAI Daggers]], [[English Electric Canberra]]s, and [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage III]] escorts), and was sent on 1 May, in the belief that the British invasion was imminent or landings had already taken place. Only a section of Grupo 6 (flying IAI Dagger aircraft) found ships, which were firing at Argentine defences near the islands. The Daggers managed to attack the ships and return safely. This greatly boosted morale of the Argentine pilots, who now knew they could survive an attack against modern warships, protected by radar ground clutter from the islands and by using a late [[Toss bombing|pop up]] profile. Meanwhile, other Argentine aircraft were intercepted by [[BAE Sea Harrier]]s operating from {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}.

One was shot down by an [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9L Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]] (AAM), while the other escaped but was damaged and without enough fuel to return to its mainland air base.

The decoying would be later extended with the formation of the [[Escuadr\u00f3n F\u00e9nix]], a squadron of civilian jets flying 24 hours a day, simulating strike aircraft preparing to attack the fleet.

The [[nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]] {{HMS|Conqueror|S48|6}} sank ''General Belgrano'' on 2 May. Three hundred and twenty-three members of ''General Belgrano''{{'}}s crew died in the incident. More than 700 men were rescued from the open ocean despite cold seas and stormy weather.

Badly damaged and with eight crew dead, ''Alferez Sobral'' managed to return to [[Puerto Deseado]] two days later. The Canberra's crew were never found.\n\n=== Sinking of HMS ''Sheffield'' ===\n[[File:HMS Sheffield (D80).jpg|thumb|HMS ''Sheffield'']]\nOn 4 May, two days after the sinking of ''General Belgrano'', the British lost the [[Type 42 destroyer]] {{HMS|Sheffield|D80|6}} to fire following an [[Exocet]] missile strike from the Argentine [[2da Escuadrilla Aeronaval de Caza y Ataque|2nd Naval Air Fighter/Attack Squadron]].\n\n''Sheffield'' had been ordered forward with two other Type 42s to provide a long-range radar and medium-high altitude missile [[picket (military)|picket]] far from the British carriers. She was struck amidships, with devastating effect, ultimately killing 20 crew members and severely injuring 24 others. The ship was abandoned several hours later, gutted and deformed by the fires that continued to burn for six more days. She finally sank outside the [[Total Exclusion Zone|Maritime Exclusion Zone]] on 10 May. \n\nThe incident is described in detail by Admiral [[Sandy Woodward]] in his book ''One Hundred Days'', in Chapter One. Woodward was a former commanding officer of ''Sheffield''.<ref>{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997|p=8}}</ref> The destruction of ''Sheffield'' (the first Royal Navy ship sunk in action since the Second World War) had a profound impact on the British public, bringing home the fact that the \"Falklands Crisis\", as the [[BBC News]] put it, was now an actual \"shooting war\".\n\n=== Diplomatic activity ===\nThe tempo of operations increased throughout the first half of May as the United Nations' attempts to mediate a peace were rejected by the Argentines. The final British negotiating position was presented to Argentina by UN Secretary General [[P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar]] on 18 May 1982. In it, the British abandoned their previous \"red-line\" that British administration of the islands should be restored on the withdrawal of Argentine forces, as supported by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 502]].\n\nInstead, it proposed a UN administrator should supervise the mutual withdrawal of both Argentine and British forces, then govern the islands in consultation with the representative institutions of the islands, including Argentines, although no Argentines lived there. Reference to \"[[self-determination]]\" of the islanders was dropped and the British proposed that future negotiations over the sovereignty of the islands should be conducted by the UN.<ref>[[Charles Moore (journalist)|Charles Moore]], ''Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography'' (2013) Volume 1, pp. 726\u2013728</ref>\n\n=== Special forces operations ===\nGiven the threat to the British fleet posed by the \u00c9tendard-Exocet combination, plans were made to use C-130s to fly in some [[Special Air Service|SAS]] troops to attack the home base of the five \u00c9tendards at [[R\u00edo Grande, Tierra del Fuego]]. The operation was codenamed \"[[Operation Mikado|Mikado]]\". The operation was later scrapped, after acknowledging that its chances of success were limited, and replaced with a plan to use the submarine {{HMS|Onyx|S21|6}} to drop SAS operatives several miles offshore at night for them to make their way to the coast aboard rubber inflatables and proceed to destroy Argentina's remaining Exocet stockpile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eliteukforces.info/articles/sas-versus-exocets.php#prof |title=The SAS vs the Exocet |publisher=eliteukforces.info |date=27 October 2007 |accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn SAS reconnaissance team was dispatched to carry out preparations for a seaborne infiltration.

Notably, the waves of eight [[Landing Craft Utility|LCUs]] and eight [[Landing craft of the Royal Marines#LCVP Mk2|LCVPs]] were led by Major [[Ewen Southby-Tailyour]], who had commanded the Falklands detachment NP8901 from March 1978 to 1979.

From there, [[Brigadier]] [[Julian Thompson (Royal Marines officer)|Julian Thompson]]'s plan was to capture [[Darwin, Falkland Islands|Darwin]] and [[Goose Green]] before turning towards Port Stanley. Now, with the British troops on the ground, the [[South Air Force]] (Argentina) began the night bombing campaign against them using [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bomber planes until the last day of the war (14 June).\n\n[[File:HMS Antelope 1982.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Antelope|F170|6}} smoking after being hit, 23 May]]\n[[File:HMS Coventry D118.jpg|thumb|left|{{HMS|Coventry|D118|6}}]]\n\nAt sea, the paucity of the British ships' anti-aircraft defences was demonstrated in the sinking of {{HMS|Ardent|F184|6}} on 21 May, {{HMS|Antelope|F170|6}} on 24 May, and {{ship|MV|Atlantic Conveyor}} (struck by two AM39 Exocets) on 25 May along with a cargo of [[helicopter]]s, runway-building equipment and tents.

However, many British ships escaped being sunk because of weaknesses of the Argentine pilots' bombing tactics described below.\n\nTo avoid the highest concentration of British air defences, Argentine pilots released ordnance from very low altitude, and hence their bomb [[fuze]]s<!--For anyone tempted to correct the \"mis-spelling\", 'fuze' is a component of a bomb, 'fuse' is an electrical component, 'fuze' is correct in this instance --> did not have sufficient time to arm before impact. The low release of the [[retarded bomb]]s (some of which the British had sold to the Argentines years earlier) meant that many never exploded, as there was insufficient time in the air for them to arm themselves.\n\nA simple free-fall bomb in a low-altitude release impacts almost directly below the aircraft, which is then within the lethal fragmentation zone of the explosion. A retarded bomb has a small parachute or air brake that opens to reduce the speed of the bomb to produce a safe horizontal separation between the bomb and the aircraft. The <!--For anyone tempted to correct the \"mis-spelling\", 'fuze' is a component of a bomb, 'fuse' is an electrical component, 'fuze' is correct in this instance -->fuze for a retarded bomb requires that the retarder be open a minimum time to ensure safe separation. The pilots would have been aware of this\u2014but due to the high concentration required to avoid [[Surface-to-air missiles|SAMs]], [[Anti-Aircraft Artillery]] (AAA), and British [[BAE Sea Harrier|Sea Harriers]], many failed to climb to the necessary release point. The Argentine forces solved the problem by fitting improvised [[Gravity bomb|retarding devices]], allowing the pilots to effectively employ low-level bombing attacks on 8 June.\n\nIn his autobiographical account of the Falklands War, Admiral Woodward blamed the [[BBC World Service]] for disclosing information that led the Argentines to change the retarding devices on the bombs. The World Service reported the lack of detonations after receiving a briefing on the matter from a [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] official. He describes the BBC as being more concerned with being \"fearless seekers after truth\" than with the lives of British servicemen.<ref name=\"Woodward\">{{harvnb|Woodward|Robinson|1997}}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref> Colonel [['H'.

A total of 961 Argentine troops (including 202 Argentine Air Force personnel of the ''Condor'' airfield) were taken prisoner.\n\nThe BBC announced the taking of Goose Green on the [[BBC World Service]] before it had actually happened. It was during this attack that [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[H.

He was posthumously awarded the [[Victoria Cross]].\n\nWith the sizeable Argentine force at Goose Green out of the way, British forces were now able to break out of the San Carlos beachhead. On 27 May, men of 45 Cdo and 3 Para started a [[loaded march]] across [[East Falkland]] towards the coastal settlement of [[Teal Inlet]].\n\n=== Special forces on Mount Kent ===\nMeanwhile, 42 Commando prepared to move by helicopter to Mount Kent.{{refn|Location: Mount Kent,\u2002Falkland Islands|group=nb}} Unknown to senior British officers, the Argentine generals were determined to tie down the British troops in the Mount Kent area, and on 27 and 28 May they sent transport aircraft loaded with [[Blowpipe (missile)|Blowpipe]] surface-to-air missiles and [[commando]]s (602nd Commando Company and 601st National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron) to [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]].

During this build-up, the Argentine air assaults on the British naval forces continued, killing 56. Of the dead, 32 were from the [[Welsh Guards]] on [[RFA Sir Galahad (1966)|RFA ''Sir Galahad'']] and [[RFA Sir Tristram (L3505)|RFA ''Sir Tristram'']] on 8 June. According to Surgeon-Commander [[Rick Jolly]] of the Falklands Field Hospital, more than 150 men suffered burns and injuries of some kind in the attack, including, famously, [[Simon Weston]].<ref>Rick Jolly, ''The Red & Green Life Machine'', p. 124.</ref>\n\nThe Guards were sent to support an advance along the southern approach to Stanley. On 2 June, a small advance party of 2 Para moved to Swan Inlet house in a number of Army [[Westland Scout]] helicopters. Telephoning ahead to [[Fitzroy, Falkland Islands|Fitzroy]], they discovered that the area was clear of Argentines and (exceeding their authority) commandeered the one remaining [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|RAF Chinook]] helicopter to frantically ferry another contingent of 2 Para ahead to Fitzroy (a settlement on Port Pleasant) and [[Bluff Cove]] (a settlement on Port Fitzroy).\n\n[[File:Stanley.falklands.war.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The road to Stanley]]\n\nThis uncoordinated advance caused great difficulties in planning for the commanders of the combined operation, as they now found themselves with {{convert|30|mi|km}} of indefensible positions, strung along their southern flank. Support could not be sent by air as the single remaining Chinook was already heavily oversubscribed. The soldiers could march, but their equipment and heavy supplies would need to be ferried by sea.\n\nPlans were drawn up for half the Welsh Guards to march light on the night of 2 June, whilst the Scots Guards and the second half of the Welsh Guards were to be ferried from San Carlos Water in the [[Landing Ship Logistics]] (LSL) ''Sir Tristram'' and the [[amphibious transport dock|landing platform dock]] (LPD) ''Intrepid'' on the night of 5 June. ''Intrepid'' was planned to stay one day and unload itself and as much of ''Sir Tristram'' as possible, leaving the next evening for the relative safety of San Carlos. Escorts would be provided for this day, after which ''Sir Tristram'' would be left to unload using a [[Mexeflote]] (a powered raft) for as long as it took to finish.\n\nPolitical pressure from above to not risk the LPD forced Commodore Clapp to alter this plan. Two lower-value LSLs would be sent, but with no suitable beaches to land on, ''Intrepid''{{'}}s [[landing craft]] would need to accompany them to unload. A complicated operation across several nights with ''Intrepid'' and her sister ship {{HMS|Fearless|L10|2}} sailing half-way to dispatch their craft was devised.\n\nThe attempted overland march by half the Welsh Guards failed, possibly as they refused to march light and attempted to carry their equipment. They returned to San Carlos and landed directly at Bluff Cove when ''Fearless'' dispatched her landing craft. ''Sir Tristram'' sailed on the night of 6 June and was joined by ''Sir Galahad'' at dawn on 7 June. Anchored {{convert|1200|ft|m}} apart in Port Pleasant, the landing ships were near Fitzroy, the designated landing point.\n\nThe landing craft should have been able to unload the ships to that point relatively quickly, but confusion over the ordered disembarkation point (the first half of the Guards going direct to Bluff Cove) resulted in the senior Welsh Guards infantry officer aboard insisting that his troops should be ferried the far longer distance directly to Port Fitzroy/Bluff Cove. The alternative was for the infantrymen to march via the recently repaired Bluff Cove bridge (destroyed by retreating Argentine [[combat engineering|combat engineers]]) to their destination, a journey of around {{convert|7|mi|km|spell=in}}.\n\nOn ''Sir Galahad''{{'}}s stern ramp there was an argument about what to do. The officers on board were told that they could not sail to Bluff Cove that day. They were told that they had to get their men off ship and onto the beach as soon as possible as the ships were vulnerable to enemy aircraft. It would take 20 minutes to transport the men to shore using the LCU and Mexeflote. They would then have the choice of walking the seven miles to Bluff Cove or wait until dark to sail there. The officers on board said that they would remain on board until dark and then sail. They refused to take their men off the ship. They possibly doubted that the bridge had been repaired due to the presence on board ''Sir Galahad'' of the [[Royal Engineer]] Troop whose job it was to repair the bridge. The Welsh Guards were keen to rejoin the rest of their Battalion, who were potentially facing the enemy without their support. They had also not seen any enemy aircraft since landing at [[San Carlos, Falkland Islands|San Carlos]] and may have been overconfident in the air defences. [[Ewen Southby-Tailyour]] gave a direct order for the men to leave the ship and go to the beach; the order was ignored.<ref name=\"SouthbyTailyour1990\">{{cite book|author=Ewen Southby-Tailyour|title=Reasons in Writing: A Commando's View of the Falklands War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0NWkAwAAQBAJ|date=31 December 1990|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-84415-014-4|page=297}} ''\"It was clear that I was achieving nothing and so, in desperation, I gave a direct order for the infantry to get ashore with or without their kit in order that we could get on with unloading Sir Tristram.<br /> The officers ignored my order.

Units of 3 Commando Brigade, supported by naval gunfire from several Royal Navy ships, simultaneously attacked in the [[Battle of Mount Harriet]], [[Battle of Two Sisters]], and [[Battle of Mount Longdon]]. Mount Harriet was taken at a cost of 2 British and 18 Argentine soldiers. At Two Sisters, the British faced both enemy resistance and [[friendly fire]], but managed to capture their objectives. The toughest battle was at Mount Longdon. British forces were bogged down by rifle, mortar, machine gun, artillery fire, sniper fire, and ambushes. Despite this, the British continued their advance.\n\nDuring this battle, 13 were killed when {{HMS|Glamorgan|D19|6}}, straying too close to shore while returning from the gun line, was struck by an improvised trailer-based [[Exocet]] MM38 launcher taken from the destroyer {{ship|ARA|Segu\u00ed|D-25|6}} by Argentine Navy technicians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fuerzasnavales.com/itb.html |title=An interview with CL (R) Ing.

In the morning gloom, one company commander got lost and his junior officers became despondent.

The three British naval vessels were survey vessels and ''Uganda'' was a passenger liner. ''Almirante Irizar'' was an icebreaker, ''Bahia Paraiso'' was an Antarctic supply transport and ''Puerto Deseado'' was a survey ship. The British and Argentine vessels operating within the Box were in radio contact and there was some transfer of patients between the hospital ships. For example, the ''Uganda'' on four occasions transferred patients to an Argentine hospital ship. The British naval hospital ships operated as casualty ferries, carrying casualties from both sides from the Falklands to ''Uganda'' and operating a shuttle service between the Red Cross Box and [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]].\n\nThroughout the conflict officials of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) conducted inspections to verify that all concerned were abiding by the rules of the Geneva Conventions. On 12 June, some personnel were transferred from the Argentine hospital ship to the British ships by helicopter. Argentine naval officers also inspected the British casualty ferries in the estuary of the [[R\u00edo de la Plata|River Plate]].\n\n=== British casualty evacuation ===\n''Hydra'' worked with ''Hecla'' and ''Herald'' to take casualties from ''Uganda'' to Montevideo, Uruguay, where a fleet of Uruguayan ambulances met them.

The success of the Falklands campaign was widely regarded as a factor in the turnaround in fortunes for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, who had been trailing behind the [[SDP-Liberal Alliance]] in the opinion polls for months before the conflict began, but after the success in the Falklands the Conservatives returned to the top of the opinion polls by a wide margin and went on to win [[1983 United Kingdom general election|the following year's general election]] by a landslide.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/vote_2005/basics/4393313.stm |title= 1983: Thatcher triumphs again |work=BBC News|accessdate=8 June 2010 | date=5 April 2005}}</ref> Subsequently, Defence Secretary Nott's proposed cuts to the Royal Navy were abandoned.\n\nThe islanders subsequently had full British citizenship restored in 1983, their lifestyle was improved by investments the UK made after the war and by the liberalisation of economic measures that had been stalled through fear of angering Argentina. In 1985, a [[Constitution of the Falkland Islands|new constitution]] was enacted promoting self-government, which has continued to devolve power to the islanders.\n\nIn Argentina, defeat in the Falklands War meant that a [[Beagle conflict|possible war with Chile]] was avoided. Further, Argentina returned to a democratic government in the [[1983 Argentine general election|1983 general election]], the first free general election since 1973. It also had a major social impact, destroying the military's image as the \"moral reserve of the nation\" that they had maintained through most of the 20th century.\n\nVarious figures have been produced for the number of veterans who have committed suicide since the war.

As such, it has been the subject of intense study by military analysts and historians. The most significant \"lessons learned\" include: the vulnerability of surface ships to anti-ship missiles and submarines, the challenges of co-ordinating logistical support for a long-distance projection of power, and reconfirmation of the role of tactical air power, including the use of helicopters.\n\nIn 1986, the [[BBC]] broadcast the ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' programme, ''In the Wake of HMS Sheffield'', which discussed lessons learned from the conflict, and measures since taken to implement them, such as [[stealth ship]]s and [[close-in weapon system]]s.\n\n=== Memorials ===\n[[File:1982 Liberation Memorial in Stanley (5612271774).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[1982 Liberation Memorial]] in [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]]]]\nThere are several memorials on the Falkland Islands themselves, the most notable of which is the [[1982 Liberation Memorial]], unveiled in 1984 on the second anniversary of the end of the war.

It was estimated that these minefields had {{formatnum:20000}} anti-personnel mines and {{formatnum:5000}} anti-tank mines. No human casualties from mines or UXO have been reported in the Falkland Islands since 1984, and no civilian mine casualties have ever occurred on the islands. The UK reported six military personnel were injured in 1982 and a further two injured in 1983. Most military accidents took place while clearing the minefields in the immediate aftermath of the 1982 conflict or in the process of trying to establish the extent of the minefield perimeters, particularly where no detailed records existed.\n\nOn 9 May 2008, the Falkland Islands Government asserted that the minefields, which represent 0.1% of the available farmland on the islands \"present no long term social or economic difficulties for the Falklands,\" and that the impact of clearing the mines would cause more problems than containing them. However, the British Government, in accordance with its commitments under the [[Mine Ban Treaty]] has a commitment to clear the mines by the end of 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.the-monitor.org/index.php/cp/display/region_profiles/theme/2282|publisher=Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor|title = United Kingdom \u2013 Mine Action, Contamination and Impact|date = 21 September 2011|accessdate =16 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|newspaper = MercoPress|title = Falklands' land mine clearance set to enter a new expanded phase in early 2012|date = 8 December 2011|location = Montevideo}}</ref> In May 2012, it was announced that {{convert|3.7|sqkm|abbr=on}} of Stanley Common (which lies between the Stanley \u2013 Mount Pleasant road and the shoreline) was made safe and had been opened to the public, opening up a {{convert|3|km|adj=on|abbr=on}} stretch of coastline and a further two kilometres of shoreline along Mullet's Creek.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://en.mercopress.com/2012/05/17/falklands-recover-370-hectares-of-stanley-common-made-minefields-in-1982-by-argentine-forces|newspaper = MercoPress|location = Montevideo|date = 17 May 2012|accessdate =17 June 2012|title = Falklands recover 370 hectares of Stanley Common made minefields in 1982 by Argentine forces}}</ref>  The 2019 deadline has not been achieved but clearance is currently scheduled for completion by 2024.<ref name=\"Hansard - landmines\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/lords/?id=2019-10-08b.1991.4 |title=Falkland Islands: Landmines - Question \u2013 in the House of Lords at 2:39 pm on 8th October 2019. |date=2020-02-20 |website=They Work for You |access-date=2020-02-20}}</ref>\n\n== Press and publicity ==\n\n=== Argentina ===\n[[File:Gentemayo1982.jpg|thumb|''Gente''{{'}}s \"Estamos ganando\" headline (\"We're winning\")]]\nSelected war correspondents were regularly flown to Port Stanley in military aircraft to report on the war.

It stated that one of the Mirages lost on 1 May had collided with a Sea Harrier and the Argentine pilot survived. In fact Argentine AAA at Stanley shot down the Mirage when it tried an emergency landing there. It was a blatant lie for all those Argentine servicemen who had seen the Mirage being shot down by Argentine guns and had removed the dead pilot from the crashed aeroplane. Similarly, the junta's press office in Buenos Aires informed that Lieutenant Antonio Jukic, who actually was killed in his Pucar\u00e1 on the ground at Goose Green, had perished in a gallant, single-handed Pucar\u00e1 attack on HMS ''Hermes'', setting it on fire. This statement was illustrated with dramatic sketches. The men at Goose Green knew that Lieutenant Jukic had died on the ground there.<br />\n''Gaceta Argentina'' summed up the British losses up to 25 May as: 5 warship sunk (correct number 3), 3 transport ships including SS ''Canberra'' (1; ''Atlantic Conveyor''), 14 Sea Harriers (2 shot down & 3 accidents) and many ships damaged, including HMS ''Hermes''.

Formed in 1998, the group is currently signed to [[Century Media Records]] and was originally a small project created by [[guitarist]] [[Gus G.]] to showcase his [[demo (music)|demo]], ''[[Nocturnal Symphony]]'' in 1998. Firewind later became a full band over three years later when they recorded their debut album, ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (album)|Between Heaven and Hell]]''. To date, the band has released eight studio albums and has been met with international success.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe band began in 1998 when the young [[Greece|Greek]] [[Gus G.]] decided to record a [[demo (music)|demo]] on a 4-track recorder with some close musician friends in the [[United States]] as Gus \"briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston\".<ref name=guitarhoo>{{cite web|title=Gus G.

Only he remained from the original formation - Leviathan owner [[David T. Chastain]] brought in [[vocalist]] [[Stephen Fredrick]] and [[drummer]] Brian Harris (both formerly of Kenziner), while Gus enlisted the help of [[bassist]] [[Kostas Exarhakis|Konstantine]]. This line-up recorded the debut album ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (album)|Between Heaven and Hell]]''.\n\n===''Burning Earth''===\nIn 2003, new changes were instituted as drummer Stian Kristoffersen and bassist [[Petros Christo]] joined the band. Harris and Konstantine had been replaced as Gus was looking for a more permanent [[rhythm section]] that was prepared to tour. This lineup recorded ''[[Burning Earth]]'' and went on a tour of [[Japan]] with [[Rob Rock]], but without vocalist Fredrick, who was not prepared to go on the road (despite prior guarantees to the contrary). At their October 2007 show at [[ProgPower USA]], the band briefly reunited with Fredrick for a few songs off their first two albums.\n\n===''Forged by Fire''===\nFredrick's replacement on the Burning the Earth Tour, singer [[Chitral Somapala|Chitral \"Chity\" Somapala]], was given the job full-time. Fellow touring member [[Bob Katsionis]] was also hired permanently to play keyboards. Firewind got a worldwide deal with [[Century Media]] by the end of that year.\n\nA few months after ''[[Forged By Fire]]'' was released, Chitral left due to personal and musical differences with the rest of the band. When his replacement, [[Apollo Papathanasio]] (of [[Time Requiem]]), was found, it was also announced that Kristoffersen would be leaving, to be replaced by [[United Kingdom|British]] drummer [[Mark Cross (musician)|Mark Cross]]. The reason for the split was that Gus wanted to have a set of Greek-based musicians willing to make Firewind their number one priority (probably to end the virtual [[revolving door]] of members) and Stian's main band was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] outfit [[Pagan's Mind]]. Gus also left his roles in Dream Evil, Mystic Prophecy and [[Nightrage]].\n\n===''Allegiance'' and ''The Premonition''===\nBetween 2004 and 2006, the band recorded ''[[Allegiance (Firewind album)|Allegiance]]'', which was released in July 2006. From November to December 2006, they toured the UK supporting [[DragonForce]] with [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]]. Firewind accomplished their 2006/2007 world tour in [[Copenhagen]] at the Scandinavian Prog Power festival on November 10. The band went around the globe almost twice being on three continents including [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]] and Europe and played nearly 100 shows. The band went to [[Sweden]] to record ''[[The Premonition (album)|The Premonition]]'', which was released in 2008.<ref>[http://www.komodorock.com/reviews/cd-reviews/firewind-%11-the-premonition-200802144281/ The Premonition - Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215192512/http://www.komodorock.com/reviews/cd-reviews/firewind-%11-the-premonition-200802144281/ |date=2008-02-15 }} Feb 14. 2008</ref>\n\n[[File:Firewind live in Paris.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Firewind performing live in France in 2008.]]\n\nIn November 2008, the band released their first DVD, ''Live Premonition'', containing footage of their entire concert at their home town in Greece on January 12 of that year. The band toured with [[Stratovarius]] in the UK during May 2009. During this tour, they added two new songs to their setlist, \"Losing Faith\" and \"Days of No Trust\". \"Losing Faith\", which contains a line in the chorus \"in the days of no trust\", was eventually to appear on 2009's  ''[[Days of Defiance]]''. In 2010 Firewind appeared in Issue 3 of the [[Eternal Descent]] Comic Book series. The narrative was inspired by lyrics from 'Angels Forgive Me' featured on 'The Premonition'\n\n===''Days of Defiance''===\nAt the end of September 2009, Firewind began work on their sixth studio album, the band confirmed that they have written twelve vocal and two instrumental songs.\n\nOn January 13, 2010, Firewind announced that they were parting ways with drummer [[Mark Cross (musician)|Mark Cross]] (Tower of Babel, God\u00b4s Army), with Michael Ehr\u00e9 (Uli Jon Roth, Metalium, Kee Marcello) playing at the live Mexico shows. Those shows, however, were cancelled. On May 7, the band recorded a cover of [[Judas Priest]]'s \"[[Breaking the Law]]\" for a compilation CD by the magazine ''[[Metal Hammer]]''. On May 26, Firewind announced the name of their new album as ''[[Days of Defiance]]'' and confirmed Michael Ehr\u00e9 as a full-time member although Mark Cross had recorded all drums on the album.\n\nOn August 6, 2010, they confirmed an October release date for their sixth studio album ''Days of Defiance'', and an August release date for the album's first single \"[[World on Fire (Firewind song)|World on Fire]]\". On the weekend of August 20\u201322, Gus G guest appeared on the radio show [[Full Metal Jackie]] where he premi\u00e8red a second song from the album, titled \"Embrace the Sun\".\n\nAlmost a year after the release of ''Days of Defiance'', Firewind did a European headlining tour, with [[Mats Lev\u00e9n]] as a replacement for Apollo who couldn't make the European leg of the tour and a US headlining tour. Gus has said in an interview that Firewind will probably do a South America(this never happened) tour after the US tour and than enter the studio for a new album. Also has Michael Ehr\u00e9 left Firewind and [[Johan Nunez]] of [[Nightrage]] replaced him on the tours and now is a full member of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalassault.com/Interviews/082911_Firewind.php |title=Firewind: In-depth Interview With Gus G (Audio) |website=Metalassault.com |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2011-09-14}}</ref>\n\n===''Few Against Many'' and 10th anniversary===\nJohan Nunez joined the session for the seventh studio album as drummer in Valve Studio in Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DB1q7M7b2I/ |title=Firewind - Studio Diary Part 1 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nFirewind debuted two songs, \"Wall Of Sound\" and \"Losing My Mind\", from their seventh studio album at headlining shows in Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VratJYXZuYs |title=YouTube |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref> The band has been confirmed for the Summer Breeze Festival and the Masters Of Rock festival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firewind.gr/2008/tour.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208004254/http://www.firewind.gr/2008/tour.html |archivedate=2012-02-08 }}</ref> In early 2012, Firewind and Century Media have announced that Firewind has re-signed with the label and that they will be releasing the new album titled \"[[Few Against Many]]\" May 21 in Europe and May 22 in North America.

Formed in 1998, the group is currently signed to [[Century Media Records]] and was originally a small project created by [[guitarist]] [[Gus G.]] to showcase his [[demo (music)|demo]], ''[[Nocturnal Symphony]]'' in 1998. Firewind later became a full band over three years later when they recorded their debut album, ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (album)|Between Heaven and Hell]]''. To date, the band has released eight studio albums and has been met with international success.\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe band began in 1998 when the young [[Greece|Greek]] [[Gus G.]] decided to record a [[demo (music)|demo]] on a 4-track recorder with some close musician friends in the [[United States]] as Gus \"briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston\".<ref name=guitarhoo>{{cite web|title=Gus G.

Only he remained from the original formation - Leviathan owner [[David T. Chastain]] brought in [[vocalist]] [[Stephen Fredrick]] and [[drummer]] Brian Harris (both formerly of Kenziner), while Gus enlisted the help of [[bassist]] [[Kostas Exarhakis|Konstantine]]. This line-up recorded the debut album ''[[Between Heaven and Hell (album)|Between Heaven and Hell]]''.\n\n===''Burning Earth''===\nIn 2003, new changes were instituted as drummer Stian Kristoffersen and bassist [[Petros Christo]] joined the band. Harris and Konstantine had been replaced as Gus was looking for a more permanent [[rhythm section]] that was prepared to tour. This lineup recorded ''[[Burning Earth]]'' and went on a tour of [[Japan]] with [[Rob Rock]], but without vocalist Fredrick, who was not prepared to go on the road (despite prior guarantees to the contrary). At their October 2007 show at [[ProgPower USA]], the band briefly reunited with Fredrick for a few songs off their first two albums.\n\n===''Forged by Fire''===\nFredrick's replacement on the Burning the Earth Tour, singer [[Chitral Somapala|Chitral \"Chity\" Somapala]], was given the job full-time. Fellow touring member [[Bob Katsionis]] was also hired permanently to play keyboards. Firewind got a worldwide deal with [[Century Media]] by the end of that year.\n\nA few months after ''[[Forged By Fire]]'' was released, Chitral left due to personal and musical differences with the rest of the band. When his replacement, [[Apollo Papathanasio]] (of [[Time Requiem]]), was found, it was also announced that Kristoffersen would be leaving, to be replaced by [[United Kingdom|British]] drummer [[Mark Cross (musician)|Mark Cross]]. The reason for the split was that Gus wanted to have a set of Greek-based musicians willing to make Firewind their number one priority (probably to end the virtual [[revolving door]] of members) and Stian's main band was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] outfit [[Pagan's Mind]]. Gus also left his roles in Dream Evil, Mystic Prophecy and [[Nightrage]].\n\n===''Allegiance'' and ''The Premonition''===\nBetween 2004 and 2006, the band recorded ''[[Allegiance (Firewind album)|Allegiance]]'', which was released in July 2006. From November to December 2006, they toured the UK supporting [[DragonForce]] with [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]]. Firewind accomplished their 2006/2007 world tour in [[Copenhagen]] at the Scandinavian Prog Power festival on November 10. The band went around the globe almost twice being on three continents including [[Asia]], [[Africa]], [[North America]] and Europe and played nearly 100 shows. The band went to [[Sweden]] to record ''[[The Premonition (album)|The Premonition]]'', which was released in 2008.<ref>[http://www.komodorock.com/reviews/cd-reviews/firewind-%11-the-premonition-200802144281/ The Premonition - Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215192512/http://www.komodorock.com/reviews/cd-reviews/firewind-%11-the-premonition-200802144281/ |date=2008-02-15 }} Feb 14. 2008</ref>\n\n[[File:Firewind live in Paris.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Firewind performing live in France in 2008.]]\n\nIn November 2008, the band released their first DVD, ''Live Premonition'', containing footage of their entire concert at their home town in Greece on January 12 of that year. The band toured with [[Stratovarius]] in the UK during May 2009. During this tour, they added two new songs to their setlist, \"Losing Faith\" and \"Days of No Trust\". \"Losing Faith\", which contains a line in the chorus \"in the days of no trust\", was eventually to appear on 2009's  ''[[Days of Defiance]]''. In 2010 Firewind appeared in Issue 3 of the [[Eternal Descent]] Comic Book series. The narrative was inspired by lyrics from 'Angels Forgive Me' featured on 'The Premonition'\n\n===''Days of Defiance''===\nAt the end of September 2009, Firewind began work on their sixth studio album, the band confirmed that they have written twelve vocal and two instrumental songs.\n\nOn January 13, 2010, Firewind announced that they were parting ways with drummer [[Mark Cross (musician)|Mark Cross]] (Tower of Babel, God\u00b4s Army), with Michael Ehr\u00e9 (Uli Jon Roth, Metalium, Kee Marcello) playing at the live Mexico shows. Those shows, however, were cancelled. On May 7, the band recorded a cover of [[Judas Priest]]'s \"[[Breaking the Law]]\" for a compilation CD by the magazine ''[[Metal Hammer]]''. On May 26, Firewind announced the name of their new album as ''[[Days of Defiance]]'' and confirmed Michael Ehr\u00e9 as a full-time member although Mark Cross had recorded all drums on the album.\n\nOn August 6, 2010, they confirmed an October release date for their sixth studio album ''Days of Defiance'', and an August release date for the album's first single \"[[World on Fire (Firewind song)|World on Fire]]\". On the weekend of August 20\u201322, Gus G guest appeared on the radio show [[Full Metal Jackie]] where he premi\u00e8red a second song from the album, titled \"Embrace the Sun\".\n\nAlmost a year after the release of ''Days of Defiance'', Firewind did a European headlining tour, with [[Mats Lev\u00e9n]] as a replacement for Apollo who couldn't make the European leg of the tour and a US headlining tour. Gus has said in an interview that Firewind will probably do a South America(this never happened) tour after the US tour and than enter the studio for a new album. Also has Michael Ehr\u00e9 left Firewind and [[Johan Nunez]] of [[Nightrage]] replaced him on the tours and now is a full member of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalassault.com/Interviews/082911_Firewind.php |title=Firewind: In-depth Interview With Gus G (Audio) |website=Metalassault.com |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2011-09-14}}</ref>\n\n===''Few Against Many'' and 10th anniversary===\nJohan Nunez joined the session for the seventh studio album as drummer in Valve Studio in Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_DB1q7M7b2I/ |title=Firewind - Studio Diary Part 1 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nFirewind debuted two songs, \"Wall Of Sound\" and \"Losing My Mind\", from their seventh studio album at headlining shows in Greece.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VratJYXZuYs |title=YouTube |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2020-04-02}}</ref> The band has been confirmed for the Summer Breeze Festival and the Masters Of Rock festival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firewind.gr/2008/tour.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208004254/http://www.firewind.gr/2008/tour.html |archivedate=2012-02-08 }}</ref> In early 2012, Firewind and Century Media have announced that Firewind has re-signed with the label and that they will be releasing the new album titled \"[[Few Against Many]]\" May 21 in Europe and May 22 in North America.

The total area of the district is 5285.01 square kilometres.  The population is 748,941.\n\nThe district's headquarters, [[Kanker, Chhattisgarh| Kanker]] town, is situated on the [[National Highway 30 (India)|National Highway NH-43]]. Kanker town lies between Chhattisgarh's two largest cities: [[Chhattisgarh]]'s capital, [[Raipur]], and [[Jagdalpur]], the district headquarters of the neighbouring [[Bastar district]].The secretary in charge for the district is Mr.Dhananjay Dewangan(IAS)\n\n==History==\nThe history of Kanker begins in the [[Stone Age]]. According to the [[Legend|legendary]] [[Sanskrit]] epics of India, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]], there was once a dense forest area named [[Dandakaranya]], in the region where Kanker is located. According to myth, Kanker was also a land of monks and sages. Many [[Rishi|Rishis]] (monks/sages) such as Kank, Lomesh, Shringi, Angira were said to have lived here. The influence of Buddhism on the region started in the sixth century BC. The ancient history of Kanker records that it always remained an independent state.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\">http://planningonline.gov.in/data/report/DP2010-2011_381Merge.pdf{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 106 AD, the Kanker state was under the rule of the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satvahana dynasty]] and the king was [[Satakarni|Satkarni]], This fact is also described by Chinese visitor Whensaung. After Satvahana rule, the state was under the control of the Nags, [[Vakataka dynasty|Vakataks]], Gupt, Nal and Chalukya dynasties. The Som dynasty was founded by the king Singh Raj, and this dynasty ruled the state from 1125 to 1344. After the downfall of the Som dynasty, Dharam Dev founded the Kandra dynasty which ruled the state up to 1385. After the downfall of the  Kandra dynasty, the Chandra dynasty came. According to a myth, the first king of this dynasty was Veer Kanhar Dev. He ruled the state up to 1404. This dynasty ruled the state up to 1802. In more recent years, this district has been affected by violence from [[Naxalite]] groups ([[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|Indian Maoists]]).\n\n==Kanker Princely State==\nThe Kanker state came under the control of the Bhosales of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]] during the reign of Bhoop Dev from 1809 to 1818. During the kingship of Narhari Deb, the Kanker state came under [[British Empire|control of the British]] from Maratha. Because the British government gave the adoption to Narhari Dev, he acknowledged fealty to the British. In 1882, the control of Kanker State was handed over to Commissioner Raipur.\n\nThe rule of Narhar Deo saw the construction of many buildings, including a palace near Gadiya Mountain, a printing press, a library, Radhakrishna Temple, Ramjanki Temple, Jagannath Temple and Balaji Temple. Narhar Deo made a plan termed 'Ratna Bhandar' for keeping grain in stock for his people. He established a new town named Narharpur near Kanker.\n\nIn 1904, Komal Dev became the king of Kanker. During his rule one English secondary school, one Girls school, and 15 primary Schools were established, as well as two hospitals: one in Kanker and the other in [[Sambalpur district|Sambalpur]]. He established a new town near Kanker named. He also tried to  the capital, instead of Kanker. He died on 8 January 1925. After his death, Bhanupratap Dev became the king. Bhanupratap Dev was the last king of Kanker before the [[Indian independence movement|Independence of India]]. After independence, he was elected twice as a member of the legislative assembly from Kanker constituency.\nChampalal Chopda landlord (zamindar) of Mulla ,Bhanupratappur ,Chougel & ottekasa was warmly generous man he was responsible ,respectful and loyal towards common people's and villagers.he worked very hard during his time temples were constructed. he followed his principals throughout his life .he also believed in simplicity and equality.

In 1999, Kanker received its identity as an independent district. It is now surrounded by five other districts of Chhattisgarh state:  [[Kondagaon District]], [[Dhamtari District]],  [[Balod district|Balod District]], [[Narayanpur, Assam|Narayanpur]] and [[Rajnandgaon District]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://kanker.gov.in/\n|title=Kander District Website\n|publisher=\n|accessdate = 2006-09-22\n}}</ref>\n\nIt is currently a part of the [[Red Corridor]], the region in the eastern, central and the southern parts of India that experience considerable [[Naxalite\u2013Maoist insurgency|Naxalite\u2013Maoist]] insurgency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2009/12/naxal-menace-83-districts-under.html |title=83 districts under the Security Related Expenditure Scheme |publisher=IntelliBriefs |date= 2009-12-11 |accessdate=2011-09-17}}</ref>\n\n==General Information==\n===Demographics===\nAccording to the [[2011 census of India|2011 census]] Kanker district has a [[Demographics of India|population]] of 748,941,<ref name=districtcensus>{{cite web | url = http://www.census2011.co.in/district.php | title = District Census 2011 | accessdate = 2011-09-30 | year = 2011 | publisher = Census2011.co.in}}</ref> roughly equal to the nation of [[Guyana]]<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web | author = US Directorate of Intelligence | title = Country Comparison:Population | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2119rank.html | accessdate = 2011-10-01 | quote = \nGuyana 744,768\n}}</ref> or the US state of [[Alaska]].<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php \n |title=2010 Resident Population Data \n |publisher=U.

May is the hottest month and December is the coolest month. Annual average rainfall in the district is 1492&nbsp;mm, 90% of which falls during the period from June to October. The average annual rainfall has fluctuated greatly over the last six years.\n\nWithin the district, the Kanker and Charama blocks have a predominantly dry climate, whereas that of Bhanupratappur is of the wet type.\n\n===Geography=== \nThe district headquarters of [[Kanker, Chhattisgarh|Kanker]] is 140 kilometers from [[Raipur]] and 160 kilometers from [[Jagadalpur]]. In 2018, the district got its first railway station in the form of [[Bhanupratappur railway station]]. Daily DEMU services connect Keoti and [[Bhanupratappur]] to Raipur.\n\nThe [[Mahanadi River]], Doodh River, Hatkul River, [[Sondur River]] and Turu River all flow through small pockets of hills in the district.\n\n===Topography===\nThe physical area of Kanker is heterogeneous and is a mix between flat land and undulating hills. Most of the land is between 300 and 600 meters above sea level, and about 80% of the area of Kanker is flat. These flat lands can be divided into two parts, the Mahanadi Plane and the Kotri Plane.\n\nThe northeastern part of Kanker is on the Mahanadi Plane. The majority of this plane lies at an elevation less than 500 meters above sea level. The main river in that area is the Mahanadi River. Hatkul, Chinar, Doodh, Sondur, Nakti, and Toori are the other rivers of the area. Bhanupratappur is located on the Kotri Plane. The majority of this plane lies at an elevation less than 400 meters above sea level. Korti and Valler are the main rivers of this area. The topography of Kanker district is also dotted with a multitude of hilly regions. These can be divided into the following three groups:\n\n'''A. Vindhyana Hill Group:''' These hill groups are spread in the south eastern part of Kanker district, where the soil constitutes six phases of quartile and sand.\n\n'''B. Archian Hill Groups:''' 95% of the area of Kanker is covered by Archian Hill Group. In this area, [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] rocks are spread over almost all the geographical area of the district.\n\n'''C. Dharwar Hill Group:''' This hill group is very crude and broken in shape and form. These hills are spread all over the northern region of the district, in the areas close to Sambalpur and Bhanupratappur.\n\n===Soil===\nThe soil in Kanker originates from granite, gneiss, sand and khedar. Most of the area is covered with red soil. The soil is faintly coloured in the higher regions of the hilly tract, while in the river valleys, the soil is smooth and fertile. The soils of this district can be divided into four types.\n\n'''A. Kanhar:''' This type of soil is black and oily. The capacity of water absorption by this soil is great, and this is very useful in growth of [[Kharif crop|Kharif]] and [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] crops in the region. This type of soil is found in the planes of Kotri and Mahanadi.\n\n'''B. Dorsa:''' This type of soil is medium in nature and it is very similar to Matasi and Kanhar type soil. This type of soil is found in north east Kanker and in the Bhanupratappur region.\n\n'''C. Matasi:''' This type of soil is found at an elevation higher than Kanhar and less than Bhata. This soil is appropriate for growing rice. This type of soil is found in most of the Kanker region.\n\n'''D. Bhata:''' This soil-type is affected by a late rating process. It can be red or yellow, having a mixed shape/condition. This soil is found in uplands of the area. It is appropriate for the cultivation of crops like [[Millet|Kodo]], [[Macrotyloma uniflorum|Kulthi]], [[Maize]] and Kutki.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThere are 7 blocks/tehsils in Kanker district. They are:\n* [[Kanker, Chhattisgarh|Kanker]]\n* Charama\n* Narharpur\n* Bhanupratappur\n* Durgukondal\n* Antagarh\n* [[Pakhanjore]]/Koylibeda.\n\nThere are 389 Gram Panchayats and 995 villages in the Kanker district.\n\n==Economy==\nAgriculture is the mainstay of people in the district. Even though large numbers of them are tribal, it is agriculture that sustains them for most of the year. Non-timber forest produce is another major source of income, as large tracts of the land are still forested. The tribes in many places practice Marham or Dippa. The farmers who live in the forest cut the trees before the rainy season and use the land for agriculture. After every two years they prepare a new farm and leave the old one [[Crop rotation|fallow]] for some time. On the planes, the land is farm every year. Rice is the main crop but wheat, sugar cane, Gram, Kodo, Moong, Tilli, and maize other important crops. People also grow varieties of vegetables. Varieties of fruits such as mangoes, and bananas are also produced.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kanker.gov.in/resources.htm|title=Resources and Economy|publisher=|accessdate=2006-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115100929/http://kanker.gov.in/resources.htm|archive-date=2006-11-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAbout half of rural Kanker is below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]], according to official estimates.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\" /> The entire district is [[drought]] prone. Over 80 percent of the working population is already dependent on marginal agriculture and allied activities, with low incomes and stagnant productivity. Thus, in addition to providing a livelihood for the unemployed, it is a challenge to make the existing the livelihoods of the nearly 295,000 (2.95 lakh) workers more productive. This would be beneficial, since persons engaged in agriculture could then earn an adequate income to meet their [[Poverty in India|basic needs]]. Thus, the only feasible option in the short to medium run is to increase employment in the main livelihood sector, which is agriculture. Diversification, intensification and stabilisation of agriculture are at the core of the challenge of livelihood promotion in the district.\n\n==Minerals==\nKanker is rich in minerals. [[Iron ore]], [[quartzite]] and [[garnet]] deposits are found in southern regions of the district, but mining of these minerals on a commercial scale has not been attempted. About 100 million tons of iron ore deposits have been identified in the Hahaladdi region of the Bhanupratappur Tehsil. Chhattisgarh's second biggest iron ore deposits, [[Rowghat Mines]], is in Antargarh tehsil in this district. Its reserves are assessed at 1.343 billion tons. Rowghat Mines will supply iron ore to the Bhilai Steel Plant of SAIL.\n\nBlack and white granite is plentiful in the district, where it is used as a building material. In the Markatola and in Barchhegondi region aluminium-bearing [[Sillimanite]]/Kinite deposits have been identified. Some deposits of gold have been found in Sona Dehi, Michgaon and in certain other regions of Bhanupratappur Tehsil. At present some [[bauxite]]-based (aluminium) industries are functional in the district.\n\n==Flora==\nMost of the forest in Kanker district is of [[Dry deciduous forest|dry deciduous]] type. In Kanker district Sal, teak and mixed forests are found. Sal forests are found in the eastern part of the district, teak forests are found in the Bhanupratappur region and mixed forests are found in most of the area. In the mixed forest varieties of medicinal plants and other economically important plants such as Saja, Rendu, Dhaura, Bija, Harra and Mahua are found in abundance.\n\n==Socio-cultural Aspects==\nAbout half of the total population is Kanker district is tribal. Accordingly, most of the culture of Kanker district is tribal, even though an interplay/fusion with other cultures is clearly visible.\n\n===Languages===\nAt the time of the [[2011 Census of India]], 66.77% of the population in the district spoke [[Hindi]], 17.06.% [[Gondi language|Gondi]], 13.10% [[Bengali language|Bengali]], 1.71% [[Halbi language|Halbi]] and 0.40% [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]] as their first language.<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-16.html 2011 Census of India, Population By Mother Tongue]</ref>\n\nThe chief languages or dialects used in the Kanker district are Hindi, [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Chhattisgarhi language|Chhattisgarhi]], [[Gondi language|Gondi]] and [[Halbi language|Halbi]]. There were times when Halbi was an important language; at one time all of the administrative work was done in that language. Halbi is a compound form of Hindi.\n\n[[Bhatri language|Bhatri]] is the main branch of Halbi language. There are a lot of words taken in this language from other languages including Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic, and Farsi. Like Hindi, Halbi also has two genders, masculine and feminine, but the feminine is used more.\n\nThe other languages such as Bengali, [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Odia language|Odia]] are also spoken in some parts of the district.\n\n===Religion===\nUntil the end of the Nal dynasty, the people were divided into four different [[Caste system in India|castes]], namely: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. After the downfall of the Nal dynasty, many people came from outside and the main castes divided into sub-castes. There were around 62 castes in Bastar state and Kanker state.\n\nThe tribes Maria, Gond, Ojha, Muria, Bhatra are divided into sub-caste San Bhatra, Pit Bhatra, Amnit Bhatra Amnit. These castes hold highest status. Parja, Gadva, Halba, Ganda, Mahra, Chandal, Ghuruva, Dom, Lohar, Matrigond, Rajgond, [[Dorla people|Dorla]], Nahar, Naikpod, Kuduk, Andkuri, Kumhar, Kosta, Chamar, Kenvat, Dhakad, were important and in other castes Brahmin, Vaishya, Kayasth, Teli, Kalar, Kshtriya, Kunbi, Dhobi, Marathi, Mohammedan, Pathan, Telanga, Orria, Rohilla and others were important. About half of the population is tribal, although in this modern era the culture has slightly changed.\n\n===Family structure===\nIn all castes, people live as a joint family. All the families are male dominant. The oldest person is the head of the family and all other members obey his authority. The oldest person of the family has full authority on all financial matters. All sons have the same share in the family assets, however daughters have no share. In tribes, the women play an important role.\n\n===Marriage===\nLike all other cultured castes, the marriage ceremony is very important to the tribes of Kanker.\n\n* Among Halbas, two types of marriages are popular, namely brief marriages and detailed marriages.\n* Among Bhatras, four types of marriages are popular namely arranged marriage, love marriages, widow marriages and dhariya marriage.\n* Among Murias, arrange marriage, love marriage and kidnapping marriages are popular.\n* Among all types of Gonds, arranged marriages, love marriages and kidnapping marriages are popular.\n\nAmong the tribes, if any woman chooses a new husband, then the new husband gives money to the old husband as 'compensation allowance'. This compensation is settled by the leader of caste. Re-marriage of widows is also popular among tribes. In Halbas no widow may be married with any unmarried person. In some tribes, there is a tradition named Ghotul. Ghotul is a cultural centre of Gonds and Murias.\n\n===Customs at death===\nThe tribal customs of death are complex.\n\nThe Maria bury dead bodies. If a woman dies during her pregnancy, her body is buried. If a child who is younger than 5 years dies, then their body is also buried beneath a Mahua tree and their head is placed facing an easterly direction. They construct a little tomb in that place in memory of the dead person.\n\nThe Gonds place the legs facing the south, in tombs. In some tribes they place a wooden pole in memory of the dead person.\n\n===Madai and other Festivals===\nAmong the tribes of Kanker and [[Bastar district|Bastar]] districts there is an important festival celebrated called [[Madai Festival|Madai]]. This festival is a moving festival and moves throughout the Kanker, Bastar and Dantewada regions from December to March. The celebration of the festival starts in Bastar Region in December. On Poornima people celebrate the Madai festival in respect of the goddess Kesharpal Kesharpalin Devi.\n\nIn January, the people of Kanker, and the adjoining areas of Charama and Kurna, celebrate the Madai festival. In the month of February, the festival is celebrated in Bastar district and there the festival is celebrated in the respect of Cheri-Chher-Kin. At the end of February, the Madai festival goes to Antagarh, Narayanpur and Bhanupratappur, and in March it is celebrated in Kondagaon, Keshkal and Bhopalpattanam. \n\nThe festival is celebrated in the respect of local Gods and Goddess. This festival is celebrated in a big ground where thousands of peoples gather simultaneously. The festival starts with a procession of local God or Goddess; after that the worship is done and then the festival starts. A lot of shops, restaurants, crafts, dances and other cultural program can be seen in this festival.\n\nAlthough the festival is tribal, all the communities have faith, celebrate and enjoy the festival.

When the Kandra king Dharma Dev won the Kanker, he declared his capital on Gadhiya Mountain, which is a natural form of a fort. On the mountain there is a natural reservoir which never dries and which is filled by water throughout the year. One part of this reservoirs is called 'Sonai' and the other part is called 'Rupai'. Sonai and Rupai were the two daughters of the Kandra king Dharma Dev. On the southern part of this reservoir there is a cave named 'Churi pagar'. The entrance to this cave is very narrow. During any attack the King and his family lived safely in this cave.\n\nThe space of the cave is sufficient to accommodate 500 people inside. The exit door of this cave is towards west direction. In the south east part of Gadiya mountain there is another cave called Jogi cave. The length of this cave is 50 meters. In ancient times, it is said that many monks lived and meditated here. There is a small pond in this cave. The water of this cave flows on the rock like a waterfall.

It is said that the water of that lake never dries and there are two fish on very bottom of that Lake. One fish is of gold and another one is of silver. According to the legend, both fish are remain alive even to this day. Many people in Kanker claim that they have seen both fish. On the mountain there are two rocks behind the main \"Sheetla Temple\" and the door between those mountain is very thin. Only slim persons can enter there, but after entering the middle there is a Big Hall in which about 300 people can be seated. People say that the King used to stay with his soldiers during any war on that particular place.\n\nOn the occasion of Navratri, a cultural fest known as Gadhiya Mahotsav is celebrated beneath the Gadhiya Mountain.\n\n===Malanjhkudum Waterfall===\nAbout 15 kilometres away towards south form Kanker, there is a small mountain.

Kanker town lies between Chhattisgarh's two largest cities: [[Chhattisgarh]]'s capital, [[Raipur]], and [[Jagdalpur]], the district headquarters of the neighbouring [[Bastar district]].The secretary in charge for the district is Mr.Dhananjay Dewangan(IAS)\n\n==History==\nThe history of Kanker begins in the [[Stone Age]]. According to the [[Legend|legendary]] [[Sanskrit]] epics of India, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]], there was once a dense forest area named [[Dandakaranya]], in the region where Kanker is located. According to myth, Kanker was also a land of monks and sages. Many [[Rishi|Rishis]] (monks/sages) such as Kank, Lomesh, Shringi, Angira were said to have lived here. The influence of Buddhism on the region started in the sixth century BC. The ancient history of Kanker records that it always remained an independent state.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\">http://planningonline.gov.in/data/report/DP2010-2011_381Merge.pdf{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn 106 AD, the Kanker state was under the rule of the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satvahana dynasty]] and the king was [[Satakarni|Satkarni]], This fact is also described by Chinese visitor Whensaung. After Satvahana rule, the state was under the control of the Nags, [[Vakataka dynasty|Vakataks]], Gupt, Nal and Chalukya dynasties. The Som dynasty was founded by the king Singh Raj, and this dynasty ruled the state from 1125 to 1344. After the downfall of the Som dynasty, Dharam Dev founded the Kandra dynasty which ruled the state up to 1385. After the downfall of the  Kandra dynasty, the Chandra dynasty came. According to a myth, the first king of this dynasty was Veer Kanhar Dev. He ruled the state up to 1404. This dynasty ruled the state up to 1802. In more recent years, this district has been affected by violence from [[Naxalite]] groups ([[Communist Party of India (Maoist)|Indian Maoists]]).\n\n==Kanker Princely State==\nThe Kanker state came under the control of the Bhosales of [[Nagpur kingdom|Nagpur]] during the reign of Bhoop Dev from 1809 to 1818. During the kingship of Narhari Deb, the Kanker state came under [[British Empire|control of the British]] from Maratha. Because the British government gave the adoption to Narhari Dev, he acknowledged fealty to the British. In 1882, the control of Kanker State was handed over to Commissioner Raipur.\n\nThe rule of Narhar Deo saw the construction of many buildings, including a palace near Gadiya Mountain, a printing press, a library, Radhakrishna Temple, Ramjanki Temple, Jagannath Temple and Balaji Temple. Narhar Deo made a plan termed 'Ratna Bhandar' for keeping grain in stock for his people. He established a new town named Narharpur near Kanker.\n\nIn 1904, Komal Dev became the king of Kanker. During his rule one English secondary school, one Girls school, and 15 primary Schools were established, as well as two hospitals: one in Kanker and the other in [[Sambalpur district|Sambalpur]]. He established a new town near Kanker named. He also tried to  the capital, instead of Kanker. He died on 8 January 1925. After his death, Bhanupratap Dev became the king. Bhanupratap Dev was the last king of Kanker before the [[Indian independence movement|Independence of India]].

May is the hottest month and December is the coolest month. Annual average rainfall in the district is 1492&nbsp;mm, 90% of which falls during the period from June to October. The average annual rainfall has fluctuated greatly over the last six years.\n\nWithin the district, the Kanker and Charama blocks have a predominantly dry climate, whereas that of Bhanupratappur is of the wet type.\n\n===Geography=== \nThe district headquarters of [[Kanker, Chhattisgarh|Kanker]] is 140 kilometers from [[Raipur]] and 160 kilometers from [[Jagadalpur]]. Though well connected by roads, the district still does not fall within the vast network of the Indian rail service.\n\nThe [[Mahanadi River]], Doodh River, Hatkul River, [[Sondur River]] and Turu River all flow through small pockets of hills in the district.\n\n===Topography===\nThe physical area of Kanker is heterogeneous and is a mix between flat land and undulating hills. Most of the land is between 300 and 600 meters above sea level, and about 80% of the area of Kanker is flat. These flat lands can be divided into two parts, the Mahanadi Plane and the Kotri Plane.\n\nThe northeastern part of Kanker is on the Mahanadi Plane. The majority of this plane lies at an elevation less than 500 meters above sea level. The main river in that area is the Mahanadi River. Hatkul, Chinar, Doodh, Sondur, Nakti, and Toori are the other rivers of the area. Bhanupratappur is located on the Kotri Plane. The majority of this plane lies at an elevation less than 400 meters above sea level. Korti and Valler are the main rivers of this area. The topography of Kanker district is also dotted with a multitude of hilly regions. These can be divided into the following three groups:\n\n'''A. Vindhyana Hill Group:''' These hill groups are spread in the south eastern part of Kanker district, where the soil constitutes six phases of quartile and sand.\n\n'''B. Archian Hill Groups:''' 95% of the area of Kanker is covered by Archian Hill Group. In this area, [[granite]] and [[gneiss]] rocks are spread over almost all the geographical area of the district.\n\n'''C. Dharwar Hill Group:''' This hill group is very crude and broken in shape and form. These hills are spread all over the northern region of the district, in the areas close to Sambalpur and Bhanupratappur.\n\n===Soil===\nThe soil in Kanker originates from granite, gneiss, sand and khedar. Most of the area is covered with red soil. The soil is faintly coloured in the higher regions of the hilly tract, while in the river valleys, the soil is smooth and fertile. The soils of this district can be divided into four types.\n\n'''A. Kanhar:''' This type of soil is black and oily. The capacity of water absorption by this soil is great, and this is very useful in growth of [[Kharif crop|Kharif]] and [[Rabi crop|Rabi]] crops in the region. This type of soil is found in the planes of Kotri and Mahanadi.\n\n'''B. Dorsa:''' This type of soil is medium in nature and it is very similar to Matasi and Kanhar type soil. This type of soil is found in north east Kanker and in the Bhanupratappur region.\n\n'''C. Matasi:''' This type of soil is found at an elevation higher than Kanhar and less than Bhata. This soil is appropriate for growing rice. This type of soil is found in most of the Kanker region.\n\n'''D. Bhata:''' This soil-type is affected by a late rating process. It can be red or yellow, having a mixed shape/condition. This soil is found in uplands of the area. It is appropriate for the cultivation of crops like [[Millet|Kodo]], [[Macrotyloma uniflorum|Kulthi]], [[Maize]] and Kutki.\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThere are 7 blocks/tehsils in Kanker district. They are:\n* [[Kanker, Chhattisgarh|Kanker]]\n* Charama\n* Narharpur\n* Bhanupratappur\n* Durgukondal\n* Antagarh\n* [[Pakhanjore]]/Koylibeda.\n\nThere are 389 Gram Panchayats and 995 villages in the Kanker district.\n\n==Economy==\nAgriculture is the mainstay of people in the district. Even though large numbers of them are tribal, it is agriculture that sustains them for most of the year. Non-timber forest produce is another major source of income, as large tracts of the land are still forested. The tribes in many places practice Marham or Dippa. The farmers who live in the forest cut the trees before the rainy season and use the land for agriculture. After every two years they prepare a new farm and leave the old one [[Crop rotation|fallow]] for some time. On the planes, the land is farm every year. Rice is the main crop but wheat, sugar cane, Gram, Kodo, Moong, Tilli, and maize other important crops. People also grow varieties of vegetables. Varieties of fruits such as mangoes, and bananas are also produced.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://kanker.gov.in/resources.htm|title=Resources and Economy|publisher=|accessdate=2006-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115100929/http://kanker.gov.in/resources.htm|archive-date=2006-11-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAbout half of rural Kanker is below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]], according to official estimates.<ref name=\"planningonline.gov.in\" /> The entire district is [[drought]] prone. Over 80 percent of the working population is already dependent on marginal agriculture and allied activities, with low incomes and stagnant productivity. Thus, in addition to providing a livelihood for the unemployed, it is a challenge to make the existing the livelihoods of the nearly 295,000 (2.95 lakh) workers more productive. This would be beneficial, since persons engaged in agriculture could then earn an adequate income to meet their [[Poverty in India|basic needs]]. Thus, the only feasible option in the short to medium run is to increase employment in the main livelihood sector, which is agriculture. Diversification, intensification and stabilisation of agriculture are at the core of the challenge of livelihood promotion in the district.\n\n==Minerals==\nKanker is rich in minerals. [[Iron ore]], [[quartzite]] and [[garnet]] deposits are found in southern regions of the district, but mining of these minerals on a commercial scale has not been attempted. About 100 million tons of iron ore deposits have been identified in the Hahaladdi region of the Bhanupratappur Tehsil. Chhattisgarh's second biggest iron ore deposits, [[Rowghat Mines]], is in Antargarh tehsil in this district. Its reserves are assessed at 1.343 billion tons. Rowghat Mines will supply iron ore to the Bhilai Steel Plant of SAIL.\n\nBlack and white granite is plentiful in the district, where it is used as a building material. In the Markatola and in Barchhegondi region aluminium-bearing [[Sillimanite]]/Kinite deposits have been identified. Some deposits of gold have been found in Sona Dehi, Michgaon and in certain other regions of Bhanupratappur Tehsil. At present some [[bauxite]]-based (aluminium) industries are functional in the district.\n\n==Flora==\nMost of the forest in Kanker district is of [[Dry deciduous forest|dry deciduous]] type. In Kanker district Sal, teak and mixed forests are found. Sal forests are found in the eastern part of the district, teak forests are found in the Bhanupratappur region and mixed forests are found in most of the area. In the mixed forest varieties of medicinal plants and other economically important plants such as Saja, Rendu, Dhaura, Bija, Harra and Mahua are found in abundance.\n\n==Socio-cultural Aspects==\nAbout half of the total population is Kanker district is tribal. Accordingly, most of the culture of Kanker district is tribal, even though an interplay/fusion with other cultures is clearly visible.\n\n===Languages===\nAt the time of the [[2011 Census of India]], 66.77% of the population in the district spoke [[Hindi]], 17.06.% [[Gondi language|Gondi]], 13.10% [[Bengali language|Bengali]], 1.71% [[Halbi language|Halbi]] and 0.40% [[Kurukh language|Kurukh]] as their first language.<ref>[http://www.censusindia.gov.in/2011census/C-16.html 2011 Census of India, Population By Mother Tongue]</ref>\n\nThe chief languages or dialects used in the Kanker district are Hindi, [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Chhattisgarhi language|Chhattisgarhi]], [[Gondi language|Gondi]] and [[Halbi language|Halbi]]. There were times when Halbi was an important language; at one time all of the administrative work was done in that language. Halbi is a compound form of Hindi.\n\n[[Bhatri language|Bhatri]] is the main branch of Halbi language. There are a lot of words taken in this language from other languages including Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic, and Farsi. Like Hindi, Halbi also has two genders, masculine and feminine, but the feminine is used more.\n\nThe other languages such as Bengali, [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Odia language|Odia]] are also spoken in some parts of the district.\n\n===Religion===\nUntil the end of the Nal dynasty, the people were divided into four different [[Caste system in India|castes]], namely: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Shudra. After the downfall of the Nal dynasty, many people came from outside and the main castes divided into sub-castes. There were around 62 castes in Bastar state and Kanker state.\n\nThe tribes Maria, Gond, Ojha, Muria, Bhatra are divided into sub-caste San Bhatra, Pit Bhatra, Amnit Bhatra Amnit. These castes hold highest status. Parja, Gadva, Halba, Ganda, Mahra, Chandal, Ghuruva, Dom, Lohar, Matrigond, Rajgond, [[Dorla people|Dorla]], Nahar, Naikpod, Kuduk, Andkuri, Kumhar, Kosta, Chamar, Kenvat, Dhakad, were important and in other castes Brahmin, Vaishya, Kayasth, Teli, Kalar, Kshtriya, Kunbi, Dhobi, Marathi, Mohammedan, Pathan, Telanga, Orria, Rohilla and others were important. About half of the population is tribal, although in this modern era the culture has slightly changed.\n\n===Family structure===\nIn all castes, people live as a joint family. All the families are male dominant. The oldest person is the head of the family and all other members obey his authority. The oldest person of the family has full authority on all financial matters. All sons have the same share in the family assets, however daughters have no share. In tribes, the women play an important role.\n\n===Marriage===\nLike all other cultured castes, the marriage ceremony is very important to the tribes of Kanker.\n\n* Among Halbas, two types of marriages are popular, namely brief marriages and detailed marriages.\n* Among Bhatras, four types of marriages are popular namely arranged marriage, love marriages, widow marriages and dhariya marriage.\n* Among Murias, arrange marriage, love marriage and kidnapping marriages are popular.\n* Among all types of Gonds, arranged marriages, love marriages and kidnapping marriages are popular.\n\nAmong the tribes, if any woman chooses a new husband, then the new husband gives money to the old husband as 'compensation allowance'. This compensation is settled by the leader of caste. Re-marriage of widows is also popular among tribes. In Halbas no widow may be married with any unmarried person. In some tribes, there is a tradition named Ghotul. Ghotul is a cultural centre of Gonds and Murias.\n\n===Customs at death===\nThe tribal customs of death are complex.\n\nThe Maria bury dead bodies. If a woman dies during her pregnancy, her body is buried. If a child who is younger than 5 years dies, then their body is also buried beneath a Mahua tree and their head is placed facing an easterly direction. They construct a little tomb in that place in memory of the dead person.\n\nThe Gonds place the legs facing the south, in tombs. In some tribes they place a wooden pole in memory of the dead person.\n\n===Madai and other Festivals===\nAmong the tribes of Kanker and [[Bastar district|Bastar]] districts there is an important festival celebrated called [[Madai Festival|Madai]]. This festival is a moving festival and moves throughout the Kanker, Bastar and Dantewada regions from December to March. The celebration of the festival starts in Bastar Region in December. On Poornima people celebrate the Madai festival in respect of the goddess Kesharpal Kesharpalin Devi.\n\nIn January, the people of Kanker, and the adjoining areas of Charama and Kurna, celebrate the Madai festival. In the month of February, the festival is celebrated in Bastar district and there the festival is celebrated in the respect of Cheri-Chher-Kin. At the end of February, the Madai festival goes to Antagarh, Narayanpur and Bhanupratappur, and in March it is celebrated in Kondagaon, Keshkal and Bhopalpattanam. \n\nThe festival is celebrated in the respect of local Gods and Goddess. This festival is celebrated in a big ground where thousands of peoples gather simultaneously. The festival starts with a procession of local God or Goddess; after that the worship is done and then the festival starts. A lot of shops, restaurants, crafts, dances and other cultural program can be seen in this festival.\n\nAlthough the festival is tribal, all the communities have faith, celebrate and enjoy the festival. Other important festivals are Mati-tihar, Gobar-boharani, [[Rama Navami]] and Navakhani.\n\nThe standard Hindu festivals of Dusshera, Diwali, and Holi are celebrated also, as in other parts of [[India]].\n\n===Handicrafts===\nThe tribal societies of Kanker are known for their handicrafts prepared with a variety of designs and shapes. These handicrafts include wood-carvings, bell-metal items, terracotta items, and bamboo items, among others. Kanker is a forestry district containing good quality woods from which wooden-carving crafts and various types of furniture are made by skilled artisans. These items attract locals as well as outsiders.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n===Wood and bamboo crafts===\nThis is one of the most distinctive arts of tribal wooden carving.{{fact|date=March 2019}} These wooden crafts are made out of the finest teak wood and white wood. These wooden crafts include models, idols, wall panels and furniture items. These handicrafts are generally exported to different parts of India, and there is also demand from foreign countries.{{fact|date=March 2019}} The tribes make bamboo crafts also. Bamboo crafts include wall hangings, table lamps, and table mats among other items.{{fact|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Noteworthy locations==\nKanker District has the following attractions:<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://kanker.gov.in/tourism.html\n|title=Tourism\n|publisher=\n|accessdate = 2012-03-31\n}}</ref>\n\n===Kanker Palace<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chhattisgarhtourism.net/index.php/home/kanker.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412052918/http://www.chhattisgarhtourism.net/index.php/home/kanker.html |archive-date=2012-04-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref>===\nThis place is very renowned for its royal palace including the tribal villages and the deep forests. The palace was owned by the esteemed 12th century royal family. The family of the late Maharajadhiraj Udai Pratap Deo resided here, since 2002. Now some section of the palace are being converted into a hotel.\n\n===The Gadiya Mountain===\nThe Gadiya Mountain came into light at the time of Kandra dynasty. When the Kandra king Dharma Dev won the Kanker, he declared his capital on Gadhiya Mountain, which is a natural form of a fort. On the mountain there is a natural reservoir which never dries and which is filled by water throughout the year. One part of this reservoirs is called 'Sonai' and the other part is called 'Rupai'. Sonai and Rupai were the two daughters of the Kandra king Dharma Dev. On the southern part of this reservoir there is a cave named 'Churi pagar'. The entrance to this cave is very narrow. During any attack the King and his family lived safely in this cave.\n\nThe space of the cave is sufficient to accommodate 500 people inside. The exit door of this cave is towards west direction. In the south east part of Gadiya mountain there is another cave called Jogi cave. The length of this cave is 50 meters. In ancient times, it is said that many monks lived and meditated here. There is a small pond in this cave. The water of this cave flows on the rock like a waterfall. The Doodh river flows at the bottom of Gadiya mountain, .\n\n'''Legend'''\nYears ago, it is said, a King lived in the Gadhiya Mountain. He had two daughters named \"Sonai\" and \"Rupai\". Both were playing near the lake over the hilly area. Suddenly they both fell in the lake; that lake was later named \"Sonai Rupai Talab\". It is said that the water of that lake never dries and there are two fish on very bottom of that Lake. One fish is of gold and another one is of silver. According to the legend, both fish are remain alive even to this day. Many people in Kanker claim that they have seen both fish. On the mountain there are two rocks behind the main \"Sheetla Temple\" and the door between those mountain is very thin. Only slim persons can enter there, but after entering the middle there is a Big Hall in which about 300 people can be seated. People say that the King used to stay with his soldiers during any war on that particular place.\n\nOn the occasion of Navratri, a cultural fest known as Gadhiya Mahotsav is celebrated beneath the Gadhiya Mountain.\n\n===Malanjhkudum Waterfall===\nAbout 15 kilometres away towards south form Kanker, there is a small mountain. On this mountain there is a spot named Neele Gondi from where the Doodh river takes its shape. After crossing the 10 kilometres there is a place named as Malanjhkudum from where the river produces three waterfalls. The heights of these waterfalls are 10 meters. 15 meters and 9 meters respectively. The slope of this water fall is like a ladder. The wave of this waterfall is very attractive and challenging. This is an ideal place for picnic. The road is available to reach this spot.\n\n===Charre-Marre Waterfall===\nThis is another waterfall situated in Kanker district. This waterfall is situated 17 kilometers away from Antagarh block of Kanker district. There is a place named Charre-Marre on the way from Antagarh to Aamabera. The waterfall produces by the river named Jogidahara which flows in Matla valley. The height of this waterfall is 16 meters.

Just outside Montrose is the 18th-century [[House of Dun]], designed by the Scottish architect [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]] and built in 1730 for David Erskine, 13th Laird of Dun.\n\n==History==\n\n===Toponymy and early history===\n\nPrehistoric elements are found in the vicinity of Montrose, including the [[Stone of Morphie]] located to the north.<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=8404 C. Michael Hogan, ''Stone of Morphie'', 2007, Megalithic Portal, ed. Andy Burnham]</ref> One ancient name for Montrose was Celurca.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p1</ref> Early place names appear to show the presence of a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in the area of the present harbour. The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

Mr. Alexander Molleson, \"Town and Parish of Montrose\", ''The Statistical Accounts of Scotland (1791-99)'', Vol.5, p24</ref>\n\n===Medieval history===\nMontrose was visited and plundered in numerous instances by [[Danes]]. In the year 980 it was sacked and razed to the ground.<ref>Mitchell (1866), p6</ref> It was once believed that a castle existed in Montrose in the 10th century and was destroyed by [[Kenneth III]]. However the historicity of this account has been disputed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Andrew Jervise, \"Memorials of Angus and the Mearns\"</ref>\n\nIn the two proceeding centuries there are no precise dates in its history. During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside. The ruins have acquired the name [[Red Castle, Angus|Red Castle]]. The last record of a charter there was in 1198.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\">Mitchell (1866), p8</ref> A [[convent]] dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary]] is said to have been founded in 1230 by [[Alan Durward]] but the precise location is unknown.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1244 the town succumbed to fire.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\nIn July 1296<ref>[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm Angus Council, \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> during the Wars of Independence, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] visited the town with 30,000 of his men and stayed at Munros castle for three nights. Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.
