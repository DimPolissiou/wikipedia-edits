Alif Capital had already used the principles of Islamic finance that did not conflict with the existing banking law and was therefore considered the first micro-financing organization that worked based on principles of Islamic banking.\n\nOver the following several years, the company has transformed into an ecosystem of technological and financial solutions for its clients. Alif is a market leader in POS financing through installment-based club-card, commission-free overdrafts, the largest online B2C platform (alif.shop), the most widely used mobile wallet (alif.mobi) in the country, and exclusive integration with the largest classifieds website. These services are facilitated by a number of internally developed complex software: Core Banking System, CRM, mobile wallet, card processing, HR & recruiting systems, built by Alif\u2019s team of 50+ software engineers. Having built these core strengths, Alif started expanding internationally, with its first office in Uzbekistan. \n\nAnother major milestone was achieved, when, in November 2019, Alif raised equity funding from Khofiz Shakhidi, a Tajik businessman in Monaco, helping Alif to convert into a full-fledged bank in Tajikistan in January 2020. \n\n= Timeline =\n\n* 2014 Alif Capital LLC was established and received a license from the [[National Bank of Tajikistan|NBT]] to operate as [[Microfinance|micro-credit]] organization on 29th April.\n* 2014 Alif Capital launched consumer credit which was dubbed as \u00ab\u0411\u0435\u0444\u043e\u0438\u0437\u00bb ([[Russian language|\u0440\u0443\u0441.]] \u0411\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 [[English language|eng.]] Interest-free) by offering short-term consumer credits (4\u20136 months) to its clients.

Alif uses the principles of [[Islamic banking|Islamic Finance]]. It is located in Dushanbe, Khujand, has a subsidiary in Tashkent and is currently expanding to other geographies. \n\n= History =\nAlif was founded in 2014. At that time the [[National Bank of Tajikistan]] (NBT) was working on instructions for financial institutions that wished to work under the principles of [[Islamic banking|Islamic Finance]]. Alif Capital had already used the principles of Islamic finance that did not conflict with the existing banking law and was therefore considered the first micro-financing organization that worked based on principles of Islamic banking.\n\nOver the following several years, the company has transformed into an ecosystem of technological and financial solutions for its clients. Alif is a market leader in POS financing through installment-based club-card, commission-free overdrafts, the largest online B2C platform (alif.shop), the most widely used mobile wallet (alif.mobi) in the country, and exclusive integration with the largest classifieds website. These services are facilitated by a number of internally developed complex software: Core Banking System, CRM, mobile wallet, card processing, HR & recruiting systems, built by Alif\u2019s team of 50+ software engineers. Having built these core strengths, Alif started expanding internationally, with its first office in Uzbekistan. \n\nAnother major milestone was achieved, when, in November 2019, Alif raised equity funding from Khofiz Shakhidi, a Tajik businessman in Monaco, helping Alif to convert into a full-fledged bank in Tajikistan in January 2020. \n\n= Timeline =\n\n* 2014 Alif Capital LLC was established and received a license from the [[National Bank of Tajikistan|NBT]] to operate as [[Microfinance|micro-credit]] organization on 29th April.\n* 2014 Alif Capital launched consumer credit which was dubbed as \u00ab\u0411\u0435\u0444\u043e\u0438\u0437\u00bb ([[Russian language|\u0440\u0443\u0441.]] \u0411\u0435\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 [[English language|eng.]] Interest-free) by offering short-term consumer credits (4\u20136 months) to its clients.

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Times New Roman and predecessor.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty-two lines in Times New Roman compared to its predecessor \"modern\" serif font.{{efn|\"Modern\" in typography is a generic term referring to designs in the [[Didone (typography)|modern or Didone]] style of the nineteenth century.}} Times appears larger on the page, with tighter linespacing and more solid in appearance.<ref name=\"Printing the Times 1932\">{{cite book |title=Printing the Times: A record of the changes introduced in the issue for October 3, 1932 |date=1932 |location=London}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Times ancestors.png|thumb|A digitisation of Times New Roman below the three typefaces originally considered as a basis for the ''Times'' project: [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]], [[Baskerville]] and [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]].

Bulked-up versions of Monotype's pre-existing but rather dainty [[Baskerville]] and [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]] typefaces were considered for a basis, and the [[Legibility Group]] designs were also examined. (Perpetua, which Monotype had recently commissioned from sculptor [[Eric Gill]] at Morison's urging, is considered a 'transitional' design in aesthetic, although it does not revive any specific model.)

Morison edited the History of the Times from 1935 to 1952, and in the post-war period, at a time when Monotype effectively stopped developing new typefaces due to [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)#Age of Austerity|pressures of austerity]], took a post as editor of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' which he held from 1945 to 1948. Times New Roman remained Morison's only type design; he designed a type to be issued by the [[Bauer Type Foundry]] of Frankfurt but the project was abandoned due to the war. (Morison's friend Brooke Crutchley recorded in his diary being told by Morison that the test type sent to him just before the war was sent to the government to be \"analysed in order that we should know whether the Hun is hard up for lead or antimony or tin.\"<ref name=\"From a Cambridge Diary\">{{cite journal |last1=Crutchley |first1=Brooke |title=From a Cambridge Diary |journal=Matrix |date=1990 |volume=10 |publisher=[[Whittington Press]]}}</ref>)\n\n==Metal type versions==\nA large number of variants of Times were cut during the metal type period, in particular families of titling capitals for headlines.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=39}} Walter Tracy in ''Letters of Credit'', Allen Hutt and others have discussed these extensively in their works on the family.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=270}}{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=207}}{{sfn|Hutt|1960|p=107}}\n\n===Titling===\nMonotype also created some caps-only 'titling' designs to match Times New Roman itself, which was intended for body text.<ref name=\"The Times: New roman and related founts.\" /> These are not sold by Monotype in digital format, although Linotype's Times Eighteen in the same style (see below) is.<ref name=\"Linotype Times Eighteen\" />\n{{clear}}\n===Times Hever Titling===\n[[File:Times Hever Titling.jpg|thumb|right|Times Hever Titling from a Monotype specimen.]]\nAn elegant titling caps design, quite different from Times New Roman with a [[Caslon|Caslon-style]] A (with a serif at top left of the letter, suggesting a stroke written with a quill) and old-style C and W; Tracy suggests Monotype's previous [[Bembo|Poliphilus]] design as an influence.

Series 827 modified some letters (notably the ''R'') to correspond to their appearance in other typefaces popular in French printing.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing. Monotype took advantage of this popularity by commissioning a widened version, Series 427, for book publishing, although many books ultimately used the original version.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=103}}\n\nAn early use of Times New Roman outside its origin was by [[Daniel Berkeley Updike]], an influential historian of printing with whom Morison carried an extensive correspondence.

Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: \"Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} He described it as particularly used in \"book work, especially non-fiction\" such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} Allen Hutt also commented that Times New Roman's relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used\u2013but ''The Times'', whose [[Style guide|house style]] in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=264}}\n\nTimes New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=102}}<ref name=\"Es gilt das gesprochene Wort\">{{cite web |last1=Bergmann |first1=Christopher |title=Es gilt das gesprochene Wort: Schriftarten f\u00fcr IPA-Transkriptionen |url=https://www.isoglosse.de/2014/03/schriftarten-ipa-transkriptionen/ |website=Isoglosse |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[American Psychological Association]] suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its [[APA style]].<ref name=\"APA Style Blog\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Chelsea |title=Fonts of Knowledge |url=https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/03/fonts-of-knowledge.html |website=APA Style Blog |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==Linotype releases==\n[[File:Many accented a (8277806822).jpg|thumb|Working drawings for a Linotype release of \"Times Roman\".

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Times New Roman and predecessor.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty-two lines in Times New Roman compared to its predecessor \"modern\" serif font.{{efn|\"Modern\" in typography is a generic term referring to designs in the [[Didone (typography)|modern or Didone]] style of the nineteenth century.}} Times appears larger on the page, with tighter linespacing and more solid in appearance.<ref name=\"Printing the Times 1932\">{{cite book |title=Printing the Times: A record of the changes introduced in the issue for October 3, 1932 |date=1932 |location=London}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Times ancestors.png|thumb|A digitisation of Times New Roman below the three typefaces originally considered as a basis for the ''Times'' project: [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]], [[Baskerville]] and [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]].

Bulked-up versions of Monotype's pre-existing but rather dainty [[Baskerville]] and [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]] typefaces were considered for a basis, and the [[Legibility Group]] designs were also examined. (Perpetua, which Monotype had recently commissioned from sculptor [[Eric Gill]] at Morison's urging, is considered a 'transitional' design in aesthetic, although it does not revive any specific model.) Walter Tracy, who knew Lardent, suggested in the 1980s that \"Morison did not begin with a clear vision of the ultimate type, but felt his way along.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=202}}\n\nMorison's biographer [[Nicolas Barker]] has written that Morison's memos of the time wavered over a variety of options before it was ultimately concluded that Plantin formed the best basis for a condensed font that could nonetheless be made to fill out the full size of the letter space as far as possible. (Morison ultimately conceded that Perpetua, which had been his pet project, was 'too basically circular' to be practical to condense in an attractive way.{{efn|Dreyfus shows proofs of the experimental recut of Perpetua with shortened descenders to allow tighter linespacing.<ref name=\"The Evolution of Times New Roman\" /> Morison later commented that \"it stared at the reader\".}})\n\n[[Walter Tracy]] and James Moran, who discussed the design's creation with Lardent in the 1960s, found that Lardent himself had little memory of exactly what material Morison gave him as a specimen to use to design the typeface, but he told Moran that he remembered working on the design from archive photographs of vintage type; he thought this was a book printed by [[Christophe Plantin]]. Moran and Tracy suggested that this actually might have been the same specimen of type from the Plantin-Moretus Museum that Plantin had been based on.<ref name=\"Anatomy of a Typeface\" /><ref name=\"Three chapters in the development of Clarendon/Ionic typefaces\" /><ref name=\"JongPurvis2005\">{{cite book|author1=Cees de Jong|author2=Alston W.

Morison edited the History of the Times from 1935 to 1952, and in the post-war period, at a time when Monotype effectively stopped developing new typefaces due to [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)#Age of Austerity|pressures of austerity]], took a post as editor of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' which he held from 1945 to 1948. Times New Roman remained Morison's only type design; he designed a type to be issued by the [[Bauer Type Foundry]] of Frankfurt but the project was abandoned due to the war. (Morison's friend Brooke Crutchley recorded in his diary being told by Morison that the test type sent to him just before the war was sent to the government to be \"analysed in order that we should know whether the Hun is hard up for lead or antimony or tin.\"<ref name=\"From a Cambridge Diary\">{{cite journal |last1=Crutchley |first1=Brooke |title=From a Cambridge Diary |journal=Matrix |date=1990 |volume=10 |publisher=[[Whittington Press]]}}</ref>)\n\n==Metal type versions==\nA large number of variants of Times were cut during the metal type period, in particular families of titling capitals for headlines.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=39}} Walter Tracy in ''Letters of Credit'', Allen Hutt and others have discussed these extensively in their works on the family.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=270}}{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=207}}{{sfn|Hutt|1960|p=107}}\n\n===Titling===\nMonotype also created some caps-only 'titling' designs to match Times New Roman itself, which was intended for body text.<ref name=\"The Times: New roman and related founts.\" /> These are not sold by Monotype in digital format, although Linotype's Times Eighteen in the same style (see below) is.<ref name=\"Linotype Times Eighteen\" />\n{{clear}}\n===Times Hever Titling===\n[[File:Times Hever Titling.jpg|thumb|right|Times Hever Titling from a Monotype specimen.]]\nAn elegant titling caps design, quite different from Times New Roman with a [[Caslon|Caslon-style]] A (with a serif at top left of the letter, suggesting a stroke written with a quill) and old-style C and W; Tracy suggests Monotype's previous [[Bembo|Poliphilus]] design as an influence.

Series 827 modified some letters (notably the ''R'') to correspond to their appearance in other typefaces popular in French printing.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing. Monotype took advantage of this popularity by commissioning a widened version, Series 427, for book publishing, although many books ultimately used the original version.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=103}}\n\nAn early use of Times New Roman outside its origin was by [[Daniel Berkeley Updike]], an influential historian of printing with whom Morison carried an extensive correspondence.

Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: \"Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} He described it as particularly used in \"book work, especially non-fiction\" such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} Allen Hutt also commented that Times New Roman's relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used\u2013but ''The Times'', whose [[Style guide|house style]] in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=264}}\n\nTimes New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=102}}<ref name=\"Es gilt das gesprochene Wort\">{{cite web |last1=Bergmann |first1=Christopher |title=Es gilt das gesprochene Wort: Schriftarten f\u00fcr IPA-Transkriptionen |url=https://www.isoglosse.de/2014/03/schriftarten-ipa-transkriptionen/ |website=Isoglosse |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[American Psychological Association]] suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its [[APA style]].<ref name=\"APA Style Blog\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Chelsea |title=Fonts of Knowledge |url=https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/03/fonts-of-knowledge.html |website=APA Style Blog |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==Linotype releases==\n[[File:Many accented a (8277806822).jpg|thumb|Working drawings for a Linotype release of \"Times Roman\".

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.
