{"title_page": "List of birds of Great Britain", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2012}} \nThis '''list of birbs of Great Britain''' comprises all [[birb]] species that have been recorded in a wild state in [[Great Britain]]. In general the [[British avifauna|avifauna of Britain]] is similar to that of the rest of Europe, although with fewer breeding species. There are 620 species of birbs on the British list {{as of|2019|8|1|lc=yes}}, the latest addition being the [[white-rumped swift]].<ref name= Bou2019>{{cite web |date= |title= British List announcements |url= https://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/recent-announcements/ |publisher= British Ornithologists' Union |access-date=4 October 2019 }}</ref> The species order and scientific names used here follow that of the official British list, maintained by the [[British Ornithologists' Union]] (BOU).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/ |title= The British List|author= British Ornithologists\u2019 Union|date= 2013 |journal=Ibis |volume=155 |pages=635\u2013676 |doi=10.1111/ibi.12069}}</ref> Decisions relating to the British list are published by the [[British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee#Records Committee|British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee]] (BOURC) in its annual reports in the ''[[Ibis (journal)|Ibis]]'', the journal of the BOU. These reports were formerly geographically based and included the whole of the British Isles, but records for the [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[Northern Ireland]] are now published by their own ornithological associations. Records from the [[Isle of Man]], although adjudicated by the Manx Ornithological Society, continue to be published in the BOU reports.<ref name= bou>{{cite journal | last= Dudley | first= Steve P | last2= Gee |first2=Mike |last3=Kehoe|first3=Chris|last4=Melling|first4=Tim M|last5=The British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee (BOURC) | year= 2006| title= The British List:A Checklist of Birbs of Britain (7th edition) | journal= Ibis | volume= 148 | pages= 526\u2013563 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118619822/PDFSTART?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0| doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2006.00603.x}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe BOU uses the following categories for British birb species:<ref name= bou/>\n*A: species that have been recorded in an apparently natural state at least once since 1 January 1950.\n*B: species that were recorded in an apparently natural state at least once between 1 January 1800 and 31 December 1949, but have not been recorded subsequently.\n*C: species that, although originally introduced by man, either deliberately or accidentally, have established breeding populations derived from introduced stock, that maintain themselves without necessary recourse to further introduction.\nCategories A, B and C constitute the Official British List. Birbs can be listed in more than one category, for example the [[Canada goose]] has a large introduced population, but there have also been a few naturally occurring vagrants, so it meets the criteria for categories A and C. Two further categories are used for record keeping only.\n*D: species that would otherwise appear in Categories A or B except that there is reasonable doubt that they have ever occurred in a natural state.\n*E: species that have been recorded as introductions, transportees or escapees from captivity, and whose breeding populations (if any) are thought not to be self-sustaining.\nBirbs in Categories D and E are not on the official British list and are not included here. A sixth category, Category F, is being compiled to include species recorded before 1800 including fossil species.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/species-categories/|title= Species categories|author= BOURC|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nSpecies listed here as '''rare''' are those for which a full description is required for acceptance of the record by the [[British Birbs Rarities Committee]]. Other species have an indication of their breeding and wintering status in Great Britain.\n\nBecause of its mild winters, Great Britain has a considerable population of wintering species, particularly [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s. There are also a number of species, such as the [[Eurasian oystercatcher|oystercatcher]], that are resident in this island, but migrants elsewhere. Also because of its position, Britain receives a number of vagrants from [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. Some American [[gull]]s, [[duck]]s and [[wader]]s are regular enough not to be considered rare. These include the [[ring-billed gull]], [[surf scoter]] and [[pectoral sandpiper]].\n\n__NOTOC__\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0 auto; width:98%; clear:both; text-align:center;\"\n!Table of contents\n|-\n| class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\" style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''Non-passerines''':\n[[#Ducks, geese and swans|Ducks, geese and swans]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grouse|Grouse]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pheasants, partridges and quail|Pheasants, partridges and quail]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Divers|Divers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Albatrosses|Albatrosses]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Shearwaters and petrels|Shearwaters and petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Austral storm petrels|Austral storm petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Northern storm petrels|Northern storm petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Tropicbirds|Tropicbirds]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Gannets and boobies|Gannets and boobies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cormorants|Cormorants]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Frigatebirds|Frigatebirds]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pelicans|Pelicans]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bitterns, herons and egrets|Bitterns, herons and egrets]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Ibises and spoonbills|Ibises and spoonbills]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Storks|Storks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grebes|Grebes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Buzzards, kites and allies|Buzzards, kites and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Osprey|Osprey]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Falcons|Falcons]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Rails, crakes and coots|Rails, crakes and coots]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cranes|Cranes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bustards|Bustards]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Oystercatchers|Oystercatchers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Avocets and stilts|Avocets and stilts]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Thick-knees|Thick-knees]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pratincoles and coursers|Pratincoles and coursers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Plovers and lapwings|Plovers and lapwings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sandpipers and allies|Sandpipers and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Skuas|Skuas]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Gulls, terns, and skimmers|Gulls, terns, and skimmers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Auks|Auks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sandgrouse|Sandgrouse]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pigeons and doves|Pigeons and doves]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Parrots|Parrots]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cuckoos|Cuckoos]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Barn owls|Barn owls]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Typical owls|Typical owls]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Nightjars|Nightjars]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Swifts|Swifts]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Kingfishers|Kingfishers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bee-eaters|Bee-eaters]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Rollers|Rollers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Hoopoe|Hoopoe]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Woodpeckers|Woodpeckers]]\n|-\n| class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\" style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''Passerines''':\n[[#Tyrant flycatchers|Tyrant flycatchers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Vireos|Vireos]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Old World orioles|Old World orioles]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Shrikes|Shrikes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Crows and allies|Crows and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Kinglets|Kinglets]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Penduline tits|Penduline tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Tits|Tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bearded tit|Bearded tit]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Larks|Larks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Swallows and martins|Swallows and martins]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bush warblers|Bush warbler]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Long-tailed tits|Long-tailed tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Leaf warblers|Leaf warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Typical warblers|Typical warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grasshopper warblers|Grasshopper warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Reed warblers|Reed warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cisticolas|Cisticolas]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Waxwings|Waxwings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wallcreeper|Wallcreeper]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Nuthatches|Nuthatches]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Treecreepers|Treecreepers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wrens|Wrens]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Mockingbirds and allies|Mockingbirds and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Starlings|Starlings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Dippers|Dippers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Thrushes|Thrushes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Old World flycatchers and chats|Old World flycatchers and chats]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Accentors|Accentors]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sparrows|Sparrows]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wagtails and pipits|Wagtails and pipits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Finches|Finches]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Longspurs|Longspurs]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cardinals and allies|Cardinals and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Buntings and American sparrows|Buntings and American sparrows]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Icterids|Icterids]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#New World warblers|New World warblers]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''[[#Species awaiting acceptance|Species awaiting acceptance]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#See also|See also]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#Footnotes|Footnotes]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#References|References]]'''\n|}\n\n==Ducks, geese and swans==\n'''Order''': [[Anseriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Anatidae]]\n\nThe swans, ducks and geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet and [[beak|bills]] which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent.

Records from the [[Isle of Man]], although adjudicated by the Manx Ornithological Society, continue to be published in the BOU reports.<ref name= bou>{{cite journal | last= Dudley | first= Steve P | last2= Gee |first2=Mike |last3=Kehoe|first3=Chris|last4=Melling|first4=Tim M|last5=The British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee (BOURC) | year= 2006| title= The British List:A Checklist of Birds of Britain (7th edition) | journal= Ibis | volume= 148 | pages= 526\u2013563 | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/118619822/PDFSTART?CRETRY=1&SRETRY=0| doi = 10.1111/j.1474-919X.2006.00603.x}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\nThe BOU uses the following categories for British bird species:<ref name= bou/>\n*A: species that have been recorded in an apparently natural state at least once since 1 January 1950.\n*B: species that were recorded in an apparently natural state at least once between 1 January 1800 and 31 December 1949, but have not been recorded subsequently.\n*C: species that, although originally introduced by man, either deliberately or accidentally, have established breeding populations derived from introduced stock, that maintain themselves without necessary recourse to further introduction.\nCategories A, B and C constitute the Official British List. Birds can be listed in more than one category, for example the [[Canada goose]] has a large introduced population, but there have also been a few naturally occurring vagrants, so it meets the criteria for categories A and C. Two further categories are used for record keeping only.\n*D: species that would otherwise appear in Categories A or B except that there is reasonable doubt that they have ever occurred in a natural state.\n*E: species that have been recorded as introductions, transportees or escapees from captivity, and whose breeding populations (if any) are thought not to be self-sustaining.\nBirds in Categories D and E are not on the official British list and are not included here. A sixth category, Category F, is being compiled to include species recorded before 1800 including fossil species.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bou.org.uk/british-list/species-categories/|title= Species categories|author= BOURC|accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nSpecies listed here as '''rare''' are those for which a full description is required for acceptance of the record by the [[British Birds Rarities Committee]]. Other species have an indication of their breeding and wintering status in Great Britain.\n\nBecause of its mild winters, Great Britain has a considerable population of wintering species, particularly [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]] and [[swan]]s. There are also a number of species, such as the [[Eurasian oystercatcher|oystercatcher]], that are resident in this island, but migrants elsewhere. Also because of its position, Britain receives a number of vagrants from [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. Some American [[gull]]s, [[duck]]s and [[wader]]s are regular enough not to be considered rare. These include the [[ring-billed gull]], [[surf scoter]] and [[pectoral sandpiper]].\n\n__NOTOC__\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"margin:0 auto; width:98%; clear:both; text-align:center;\"\n!Table of contents\n|-\n| class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\" style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''Non-passerines''':\n[[#Ducks, geese and swans|Ducks, geese and swans]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grouse|Grouse]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pheasants, partridges and quail|Pheasants, partridges and quail]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Divers|Divers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Albatrosses|Albatrosses]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Shearwaters and petrels|Shearwaters and petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Austral storm petrels|Austral storm petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Northern storm petrels|Northern storm petrels]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Tropicbirds|Tropicbirds]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Gannets and boobies|Gannets and boobies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cormorants|Cormorants]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Frigatebirds|Frigatebirds]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pelicans|Pelicans]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bitterns, herons and egrets|Bitterns, herons and egrets]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Ibises and spoonbills|Ibises and spoonbills]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Storks|Storks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grebes|Grebes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Buzzards, kites and allies|Buzzards, kites and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Osprey|Osprey]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Falcons|Falcons]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Rails, crakes and coots|Rails, crakes and coots]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cranes|Cranes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bustards|Bustards]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Oystercatchers|Oystercatchers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Avocets and stilts|Avocets and stilts]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Thick-knees|Thick-knees]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pratincoles and coursers|Pratincoles and coursers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Plovers and lapwings|Plovers and lapwings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sandpipers and allies|Sandpipers and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Skuas|Skuas]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Gulls, terns, and skimmers|Gulls, terns, and skimmers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Auks|Auks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sandgrouse|Sandgrouse]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Pigeons and doves|Pigeons and doves]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Parrots|Parrots]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cuckoos|Cuckoos]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Barn owls|Barn owls]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Typical owls|Typical owls]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Nightjars|Nightjars]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Swifts|Swifts]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Kingfishers|Kingfishers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bee-eaters|Bee-eaters]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Rollers|Rollers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Hoopoe|Hoopoe]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Woodpeckers|Woodpeckers]]\n|-\n| class=\"wikitable nowraplinks\" style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''Passerines''':\n[[#Tyrant flycatchers|Tyrant flycatchers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Vireos|Vireos]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Old World orioles|Old World orioles]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Shrikes|Shrikes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Crows and allies|Crows and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Kinglets|Kinglets]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Penduline tits|Penduline tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Tits|Tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bearded tit|Bearded tit]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Larks|Larks]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Swallows and martins|Swallows and martins]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Bush warblers|Bush warbler]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Long-tailed tits|Long-tailed tits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Leaf warblers|Leaf warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Typical warblers|Typical warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Grasshopper warblers|Grasshopper warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Reed warblers|Reed warblers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cisticolas|Cisticolas]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Waxwings|Waxwings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wallcreeper|Wallcreeper]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Nuthatches|Nuthatches]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Treecreepers|Treecreepers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wrens|Wrens]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Mockingbirds and allies|Mockingbirds and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Starlings|Starlings]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Dippers|Dippers]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Thrushes|Thrushes]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Old World flycatchers and chats|Old World flycatchers and chats]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Accentors|Accentors]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Sparrows|Sparrows]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Wagtails and pipits|Wagtails and pipits]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Finches|Finches]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Longspurs|Longspurs]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Cardinals and allies|Cardinals and allies]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Buntings and American sparrows|Buntings and American sparrows]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#Icterids|Icterids]]&nbsp;\u2022\n[[#New World warblers|New World warblers]]\n|-\n| style=\"padding:0 2% 0 2%; text-align:center;\"|\n'''[[#Species awaiting acceptance|Species awaiting acceptance]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#See also|See also]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#Footnotes|Footnotes]]'''{{nbsp|7}}\n'''[[#References|References]]'''\n|}\n\n==Ducks, geese and swans==\n'''Order''': [[Anseriformes]]{{nbsp|3}}'''Family''': [[Anatidae]]\n\nThe swans, ducks and geese are medium to large birds that are adapted to an aquatic existence with webbed feet and [[beak|bills]] which are flattened to a greater or lesser extent.

His first known works date to the mid 1740s and consist of sheets of ornaments engraved with chisels for decoration rifles, pistols or snuff.\n\nIn 1755 he settled permanently in the rue de la Pelleterie, near the Royal Palace.

[[Jean-Charles Fran\u00e7ois]] who was a partner of Demarteau further developed the technique and used it to engrave the whole plate. Fran\u00e7ois engraved in 1757 three etchings directly on copper in crayon manner.  He then used the technique to etch three plates using different-size needles bound together.  Other people who contributed to this new  engraving technique included Alexis Magny and Jean-Baptiste Delafosse. Fran\u00e7ois and Demarteau separated ways in 1757 over conflicts relating to who was entitled to call himself the inventor of the new technique.  In 1759 Demarteau was joined in his studio by Louis-Marin Bonnet, a former pupil and collaborator of Fran\u00e7ois.  Bonnet engraved in that same year his first plate for Demarteau.\n\nDemarteau cut in 1759 his first plate in the crayon manner, which would be the first of about 300 plates after [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]]'s drawings.  Because of his superior drawing and engraving skills Demarteau was able to become the primary exponent of the crayon manner process in France.<ref name=ward>Gerald W. R. Ward, 'The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art', Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 153</ref> Demarteau's prints were very popular because of their technical brilliance and their low price.  [[Denis Diderot]] mentions his work on several occasions in his reports on the [[Salon (Paris)|Parisian Salons]]. \n[[File:Gilles Demarteau (after Charles Andr\u00e9 van Loo) - A group of soldiers standing on the right and looking as one of them is talking to a sailor.jpg|thumb|Group of soldiers, after Charles Andr\u00e9 van Loo]]\n\nIn 4 April 1767, Demarteau presented his first two-colour plates to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] which gave him its approval.  On 2 September 1769 he was admitted as a member of the Acad\u00e9mie for his engraving of a print under the title ''Lycurgus''. In this session, the designer [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] was also admitted for his design of that print.<ref name=micha/>\n\nThe following year Demarteau was appointed engraver to the King ('Graveur des Dessins du Cabinet du Roi') and received a pension of six hundred ''[[French livre|livres]]'' (pounds). He replaced the engraver [[Jean-Charles Fran\u00e7ois]] in this position.<ref name=arch/>\n\nThe artists Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and Jean-Baptiste Huet painted decorative murals in the salon of Gilles Antoine Demarteau's house in the rue de la Pelleterie.

His oeuvre comprises about 560 numbered plates.\n[[File:Gilles Demarteau (after Fran\u00e7ois Boucher) - Nude female figure, lying on her back, on a couch with two putti.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Nude female figure with putti, after Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]]\n\nHis first known works were made using the etching technique and the burin and were made for book and music publishers.  He also made illustrations of La Fontaine's ''Fables''.\n\nHis reproductive works were mainly made after the works of [[Charles-Andr\u00e9 van Loo]], [[Jean-Baptiste Huet]], [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]], [[Antoine Watteau]] and most frequently Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.  Half of his works were made after drawings by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher or after drawings owned by collectors such as the family Blondel d\u2019Azincourt.<ref name=micha/>  Painters of the 18th century were accustomed, before beginning a painting, to make sketches in sanguine.  They regularly executed these sketches with pencils of different colors. The crayon manner of engraving allowed engravers like Gilles Demarteau to produce faithful reproductions of these designs.  These prints in red ink so much resembled red chalk drawings that they could be framed as little pictures. They could then be hung in the small blank spaces of the elaborately decorated paneling of homes.<ref>[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/94303/rec/1 Alpheus Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints & People: A Social History of Printed Pictures]'', Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), 1 January 1971, p. 589</ref>\n\nDemarteau also engraved about 40 drawing manuals, which included plates after designs by [[Jean-Pierre Hou\u00ebl]], Jean-Baptiste Huet and the sculptor [[Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon]].<ref name=micha/>\n\nAround 1750-55 Demarteau published a pattern book with 19 plates devoted solely to firearms decorations.<ref name=met/>\nAt the end of his career Demarteau commenced reproductions of the works of [[Raphael]] or [[Michelangelo]].<ref name=micha/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*Color{{commons category-inline|Gilles Demarteau|Gilles Demarteau}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demarteau, Gilles}}\n[[Category:1776 deaths]]\n[[Category:French etchers]]\n[[Category:People from Paris]]\n[[Category:18th-century engravers]]\n[[Category:French engravers]]\n[[Category:1722 births]]\n[[Category:Color engravers]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Gilles Demarteau (after Fran\u00e7ois Boucher) - A peasant boy, standing with a gourd in left hand.jpg|thumb|A peasant boy, after Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]]\n\n'''Gilles Demarteau''' or '''Gilles Demarteau the Elder''' (19 January 1722, in [[Li\u00e8ge]] \u2013 31 July 1776, in Paris) was an [[etcher]], [[engraver]] and publisher who was active in Paris for his entire career.<ref name=ox>Madeleine Barbin. \"Demarteau, Gilles.\" Grove Art Online.

Fran\u00e7ois and Demarteau separated ways in 1757 over conflicts relating to who was entitled to call himself the inventor of the new technique.  In 1759 Demarteau was joined in his studio by Louis-Marin Bonnet, a former pupil and collaborator of Fran\u00e7ois.  Bonnet engraved in that same year his first plate for Demarteau.\n\nDemarteau cut in 1759 his first plate in the crayon manner, which would be the first of about 300 plates after [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]]'s drawings.  Because of his superior drawing and engraving skills Demarteau was able to become the primary exponent of the crayon manner process in France.<ref name=ward>Gerald W. R. Ward, 'The Grove Encyclopedia of Materials and Techniques in Art', Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 153</ref> Demarteau's prints were very popular because of their technical brilliance and their low price.  [[Denis Diderot]] mentions his work on several occasions in his reports on the [[Salon (Paris)|Parisian Salons]]. \n[[File:Gilles Demarteau (after Charles Andr\u00e9 van Loo) - A group of soldiers standing on the right and looking as one of them is talking to a sailor.jpg|thumb|Group of soldiers, after Charles Andr\u00e9 van Loo]]\n\nIn 4 April 1767, Demarteau presented his first two-colour plates to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] which gave him its approval.  On 2 September 1769 he was admitted as a member of the Acad\u00e9mie for his engraving of a print under the title ''Lycurgus''. In this session, the designer [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] was also admitted for his design of that print.<ref name=micha/>\n\nThe following year Demarteau was appointed engraver to the King ('Graveur des Dessins du Cabinet du Roi') and received a pension of six hundred ''[[French livre|livres]]'' (pounds). He replaced the engraver [[Jean-Charles Fran\u00e7ois]] in this position.<ref name=arch/>\n\nThe artists Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard, Fran\u00e7ois Boucher and Jean-Baptiste Huet painted decorative murals in the salon of Gilles Antoine Demarteau's house in the rue de la Pelleterie.  The panels are now in the [[Carnavalet Museum]] in Paris.<ref name=arch/><ref>[http://parismuseescollections.paris.fr/musee-carnavalet/oeuvres/panneaux-decoratifs-pour-le-salon-de-demarteau#infos-secondaires-detail Panneaux d\u00e9coratifs pour le salon de Demarteau] at the Carnavalet Museum {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nHis nephew Gilles Antoine Demarteau (also referred to as 'Gilles Antoine Demarteau the Younger') (1756-1802) became an engraver and took over his uncle's workshop.<ref name=arch/>  Demarteau was able to collect a large number of drawings of prominent draughtsman of his generation, the majority of which were inherited by his nephew and sold at auction on the death of his nephew in 1802.<ref name=raux/>\n\n==Work==\nGilles Demarteau was mainly a reproductive artist who worked in the new crayon manner style which he had helped to invent.  His oeuvre comprises about 560 numbered plates.\n[[File:Gilles Demarteau (after Fran\u00e7ois Boucher) - Nude female figure, lying on her back, on a couch with two putti.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Nude female figure with putti, after Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]]\n\nHis first known works were made using the etching technique and the burin and were made for book and music publishers.  He also made illustrations of La Fontaine's ''Fables''.\n\nHis reproductive works were mainly made after the works of [[Charles-Andr\u00e9 van Loo]], [[Jean-Baptiste Huet]], [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]], [[Antoine Watteau]] and most frequently Fran\u00e7ois Boucher.  Half of his works were made after drawings by Fran\u00e7ois Boucher or after drawings owned by collectors such as the family Blondel d\u2019Azincourt.<ref name=micha/>  Painters of the 18th century were accustomed, before beginning a painting, to make sketches in sanguine.  They regularly executed these sketches with pencils of different colors. The crayon manner of engraving allowed engravers like Gilles Demarteau to produce faithful reproductions of these designs.  These prints in red ink so much resembled red chalk drawings that they could be framed as little pictures. They could then be hung in the small blank spaces of the elaborately decorated paneling of homes.<ref>[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/94303/rec/1 Alpheus Hyatt Mayor, ''Prints & People: A Social History of Printed Pictures]'', Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.), 1 January 1971, p. 589</ref>\n\nDemarteau also engraved about 40 drawing manuals, which included plates after designs by [[Jean-Pierre Hou\u00ebl]], Jean-Baptiste Huet and the sculptor [[Edm\u00e9 Bouchardon]].<ref name=micha/>\n\nAround 1750-55 Demarteau published a pattern book with 19 plates devoted solely to firearms decorations.<ref name=met/>\nAt the end of his career Demarteau commenced reproductions of the works of [[Raphael]] or [[Michelangelo]].<ref name=micha/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*Color{{commons category-inline|Gilles Demarteau|Gilles Demarteau}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demarteau, Gilles}}\n[[Category:1776 deaths]]\n[[Category:French etchers]]\n[[Category:People from Paris]]\n[[Category:18th-century engravers]]\n[[Category:French engravers]]\n[[Category:1722 births]]\n[[Category:Color engravers]]\n", "name_user": "Owunsch", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed typo (extra \u201cfurther\u201d)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Demarteau"}

Historically, it has been applied to any instrument of the [[cittern]] family, or to an instrument consisting of many [[string (music)|strings]] stretched across a thin, flat body&nbsp;\u2013 similar to a [[psaltery]]. This article describes the latter variety.<ref name=OED>{{cite web\n|title=zither\n|work=Oxford Dictionaries Online\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|year=2013\n|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/zither\n|accessdate=2013-10-26\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Strings on a table\n|work=Merriam-Webster.com\n|publisher=Merriam-Webster\n|year=2013\n|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zither\n|accessdate=2013-10-26\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=zither\n|work=Dictionary.com Unabridged\n|publisher=Random House, Inc.\n|year=2013\n|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zither\n|accessdate=2013-10-26\n}}</ref>\n\nZithers are played by strumming or plucking the strings, either with the fingers (sometimes using an accessory called a [[plectrum]] or ''pick''), sounding the strings with a [[Bow (music)|bow]], or, with varieties of the instrument like the [[santur]] or [[cimbalom]], by beating the strings with specially shaped hammers. Like a [[guitar]] or [[lute]], a zither's body serves as a resonating chamber ([[sound box]]), but, unlike guitars and lutes, a zither lacks a distinctly separate [[neck (music)|neck]] assembly. The number of strings varies, from one to more than fifty.\n\nIn modern common usage the term \"zither\" refers to three specific instruments: the '''concert zither''' ({{lang-de|Konzertzither}}), its variant the '''Alpine zither''' (both using a [[Fretted instrument|fretted]] [[fingerboard]]), and the '''chord zither''' (more recently described as a fretless zither or \"guitar zither\"). Concert and Alpine zithers are traditionally found in [[Slovenia]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Epinette des Vosges|France]], north-western [[Croatia]], the southern regions of [[Germany]], alpine Europe, [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]. Emigration from these areas during the 19th century introduced the concert and Alpine zither to North and South America. Chord zithers similar to the instrument in the photograph also became popular in North America during the late 19th and early 20th century. These variants all use metal strings, similar to the cittern.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word 'zither' is derived from Latin [[cythara]], which was used in this form for the title covers on many 16th and 17th century German printed manuscript books originally for the 'cittern'&nbsp;\u2013 from the Greek word [[kithara]], an instrument [[Ancient Greek music|used in Ancient Greece]].<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/zither Zither]</ref> The German scholar [[Michael Praetorius]] mentions an Englishman who came to Germany with a small cittern, ''{{lang|de|einem kleinen Citterlein}}'', in his treatise ''[[Syntagma Musicum]]'', published during the early 17th century.<ref>Praetorius, Michael; ''Syntagma Musicum'':  ''De Organographia Part I and I'' (1619); Oxford University Press; London:  1986. \n 019316406X</ref>  It is not fully understood how 'zitter' or 'zither' came to be applied to the instruments in this article as well as German varieties of the cittern. Other types of zither also existed in Germany, mostly [[drone zither]]s like the [[scheitholt]] (which was mentioned by Praetorius) or [[Hummel (instrument)|hummel]], but these generally have their own individual regional names and may have been in use before the introduction into the [[lexicon]] of 'cythara' and its German derivative [[cognate]].\n\n== Organology ==\nThe [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] system, an academic instrument classification method, also uses the term ''zither'' to classify all stringed instruments in which the strings do not extend beyond the [[sounding box]]. This includes such diverse instruments as the [[hammered dulcimer]], [[psaltery]], [[Appalachian dulcimer]], [[guqin]], [[guzheng]], [[tromba marina]], [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]], [[gusli]], [[Kanun (instrument)|kanun]], [[kankl\u0117s]], [[kantele]], [[Kannel (instrument)|kannel]], [[kokles]], [[valiha]], [[gayageum]], [[\u0111\u00e0n tranh]], [[autoharp]], [[santoor]], [[yangqin]], [[santur]], [[swarmandal]], and others. [[Pedal steel guitar]]s, [[Lap steel guitar|lap guitars]] (where the neck serves no separate function other than to extend the string length), and [[keyboard instruments]] like the [[clavichord]], [[harpsichord]] and [[piano]] also fall within this broad categorical use.<ref>Hornbostel,Erich M. von and Sachs, Curt; ''Classification of Musical Instruments'': Translated from the Original German by Anthony Baines and Klaus P. Wachsmann; '''The Galpin Society Journal''', Vol. 14; March 1961, pp. 3-29</ref>\n\nThe word has also been used in conjunction with brand varieties of other string instruments, for example the zither [[banjo]].<ref>[https://creekdontrise.com/acoustic/zither_banjo/shlomo/shlomos_english_zither_banjo_article.htm Pestcoe, Schlomo; ''The English Zither Banjo'']</ref>\n\n==History and development==\n[[File:Lian Zhu Shi.jpg|left|thumb|65px|Chinese [[Guqin]] with seven strings]][[File:79-tone Kanun on the couch.jpg|thumb|Turkish Qanun with 79 strings]]\n\nAlthough there is evidence that a kanun was found in Mycenaean Greece, dating back to 1600BC, the earliest known surviving instrument of the zither family is a Chinese [[guqin]], a fretless instrument, found in the [[tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng]] dating from 433&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/XXIV/3/375.pdf|title=Source and stream: early music and living traditions in China|author=Stephen Jones|publisher=[[Oxford Journals]]}}</ref> Similar instruments along this design were developed over the following centuries, for example: the Japanese silk strung [[Koto (instrument)|koto]], the [[siter]] of Indonesian [[gamelan]]s; the [[Qanun (instrument)|Q\u0101n\u016bn (or Kanun)]] of Greece and the Middle East; the [[valiha]], a tube zither of Madagascar; and many others. Increasing interest in '[[world music]]' has brought wider recognition to these other zither family members, both ancient and modern. Many of these instruments have been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] electronically, and are available in instrument banks for music [[synthesizers]].\n\n[[File:Scheitholt instrument.jpg|thumb|170px|Alpine Scheitholt]]\nIn Europe and other more northern and western regions, early zithers were more similar to the modern [[mountain dulcimer]], having long, usually rectangular, sound boxes, with one or more melody strings and several unfretted [[drone (music)|drone]] strings. Some of these employed movable bridges similar to the Japanese koto, used for retuning the drone strings. The Alpine ''[[Scheitholt (musical instrument)|Scheitholt]]'' furnishes an example of this older type of European zither. By the late 18th century, two principal varieties of European concert zither had developed, known as the ''[[Salzburg]] zither'' (with a rounded side away from the player), and the ''[[Mittenwald]] zither'' (with both sides rounded). Both styles are still found in concert zithers today, although the Salzburg style has become by far the most common.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Zither |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/657593/zither |encyclopedia=britannica.com}}</ref>\n[[File:009 Landleute bei Aussee in Steiermark.jpg|thumb|Zitherist before 1850 in [[Bad Aussee|Ausseerland]], [[Styria]], playing a ''Salzburg''-style instrument]]\nThe zither became a popular folk music instrument in Bavaria and Austria and, at the beginning of the 19th century, was known as a ''{{lang|de|Volkszither}}''.\n \nViennese zitherist [[Johann Petzmayer]] (1803\u20131884) became one of the outstanding virtuosi on these early instruments and is credited with making the zither a household instrument.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zithers-usa.com/History.htm |title=History |publisher=www.zithers-usa.com |accessdate=6 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220457/http://www.zithers-usa.com/History.htm |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}</ref>\nIn 1838, Nikolaus Weigel of Munich conceived the idea of adopting fixed bridges, adding additional strings, tuning them in the cycle of fifths, and chromatically fretting the fingerboard&nbsp;\u2013 effectively converting a rather crude folk instrument into the concert zither. His ideas were not, however, widely accepted until 1862, when luthier Max Amberger of Munich fabricated a new zither based on Weigel's design.<ref name=\"history\"/> At this point the zither had reached something very close to its modern concert form. Within a relatively short time the new design had largely replaced the old Volkszither (though still called by the same name among folk musicians) throughout central Europe, particularly in the [[Alpine states|Alpine countries]]. As the 'concert zither' it also began to attract the attention of serious composers, a number of whom, themselves, became concert zither virtuosi. These composers, called the \"''{{lang|de|Altmeister}}''\", flourished between 1870 and 1910. And no less a composer than [[Johann Strauss II]] gave the instrument a prominent solo in one of his most famous waltzes, \"[[Tales from the Vienna Woods]]\".<ref group = nb>The part is sometimes played on a mandolin, when a zither is not available.</ref>\n\nThe zither went through two periods of great popularity in the United States. The first of these was in the late 19th through early 20th century, when it was greatly in vogue as a [[parlour]] instrument in many homes. During that period, a number of U.S.-based instrument manufacturers, many of them founded by, or staffed with, European (and especially German and Austrian) luthiers, were producing concert zithers. Chord zithers were often marketed under confusing brand names like '[[guitar zither]]' or 'mandoline zither'. The recently rediscovered recordings of the gospel singer [[Washington Phillips]], who used two instruments simultaneously, have revealed the virtuosic capability of the chord zither to modern musicians seeking to revive it. By the 1920s, this popularity had begun to wane, as other string instruments (notably guitars) increased in popularity along with the new fashion for [[jazz music]].\n\nIn the 1950s, interest in zithers resurfaced due in great measure to the success of the 1949 British [[film noir]] ''[[The Third Man]]''. The [[soundtrack]] music for the film, which featured only a concert zither (no other instruments)&nbsp;\u2013 was performed by the Viennese musician [[Anton Karas]]. His \"[[The Third Man Theme]]\" was released as a single in 1949\u201350 and became a best-seller in the UK.<ref name=\"time1949\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856412,00.html Music: Zither Dither], a 28 November 1949 article from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine</ref> Following its release in the U.S. in 1950, it spent eleven weeks at number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s U.S. [[Best Sellers in Stores]] Chart from April 29th to July 8th.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/3hq6ab.htm |title=Song title 199 - Third Man Theme |publisher=Tsort.info |date=2007-10-08 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref> The exposure made Karas an international star.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/movienews/index/?cid=157596 \"The Third Man\" DVD review], Sean Axmaker, ''Turner Classic Movies''.</ref> A ''Time'' magazine film preview stated that \"the famous musical score by Anton Karas\" would have the audience \"in a dither with his zither\".<ref name=\"ultimatetrailer\">''The Ultimate Trailer Show''. HDNet, 22 September 2010.</ref>\n\nThis new popularity for the zither lasted until well into the 1960s with many successful albums during the period from performers such as Karas, [[Ruth Welcome]], and [[Shirley Abicair]]. German-born American Ruth Welcome released a number of very popular theme-based zither albums between 1958 and 1965 (e.g., ''Romantic Zither''; ''Zither South of the Border''; ''Zither Goes to Hollywood''). Australian-born singer Shirley Abicair popularised the chord zither when she used it for accompaniment in her TV shows, live performances and recordings in Britain in the 1950s and '60s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/sep/04/101-strangest-spotify-ruth-welcome|title=The 101 strangest records on Spotify: Ruth Welcome \u2013 Romantic Zither|first=Rob|last=Fitzpatrick|date=4 September 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/843632-Ruth-Welcome|title=Ruth Welcome|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref> Zither music also featured in a ''Twilight Zone'' episode&nbsp;\u2013 [[Mr Bevis]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=the-twilight-zone-1959&episode=s01e33|title=The Twilight Zone (1959) s01e33 Episode Script - SS|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough interest in the zither had once more begun to wane by the late 1960s, owing to the two American vogues there are still many used instruments to be found, in various states of disrepair.  It has become something of a truism that most zithers seen today are either 60 or 110 years old.  Currently (2019) only a few independent luthiers and mid-European makers are producing new instruments.\n\n==Concert and Alpine zithers==\nA '''concert zither''' may have from 29 to 38 strings, with 34 or 35 being most typical. These are arranged as follows: four or five fretted melody strings, placed above a guitar-like fretboard; 12 unfretted \"accompaniment\" strings; followed by 12 unfretted \"bass\" strings; followed by a varying number of \"contrabass\" strings, with five or six being the most common number.\n[[File:Ft.Slocum.1865.zither.jpg|thumb|German Concert Zither at Ft. Slocum, Nov. 1865]]\n[[Image:Zither.png|left|thumb|'''Concert zither''', with a fretted fingerboard. This variety is a ''discant Salzburger Konzertzither'']]\n\nOn some older zithers, one may find \"half-frets\" above the 12th fret, which extend only under the first two or three strings. This results in the lower fretted strings having no pitches (or no ''[[chromatic]]'' pitches) available above the 12th fret, while the higher fretted strings still have higher chromatic pitches available at these half-frets. Nearly all instruments made after 1960, however, have full-length frets all the way up the fretboard.\n\nAnton Karas and Ruth Welcome used instruments of similar design to the one illustrated. After World War II, Karas (according to zither scholar G\u00fcnter Wittenstein, who was acquainted with him) performed on an instrument of larger dimensions than normal&nbsp;\u2013 with a 43&nbsp;cm standard scale length for the fingerboard strings. He used Viennese tuning (see below), but with an altered chromatic sequence for the fingerboard and open strings. The accompaniment strings G and F{{Music|#}} were tuned an octave higher, while contrabass strings tuned E{{Music|b}}, F, D, E, C{{Music|#}} replaced the regular [[cycle of fifths]] bass strings. This brought the contrabasses closer to the fingerboard where the player could reach them more easily.\n\nFor ''The Third Man'', Karas tuned the zither a [[semi-tone]] lower, giving a particularly distinctive tone to the contrabass strings. The resulting lower string tension also enabled Karas to perform an expressive vibrato on the fingerboard melody strings. Film director [[Carol Reed]], (on whose oak kitchen table the music was performed), described the sound as \"gritty and dirty\", perfectly reflecting the atmospheric mood of the film.\n\n[[Image:MIDPTR 619a 2005 rotated contrast-enhanced.jpg|right|thumb|An '''Alpine Zither'''.  Note the \"harp post\" at the top of the image.]]\nThe '''Alpine zither''' has 42 strings, and differs from the concert zither primarily in requiring the addition of an extension to the body of the instrument to support both the longer additional contrabass strings and their tuners.\n\nAlpine zithers are tuned in a similar manner to the concert zither, with the accompaniment and bass strings each providing a full set of 12 chromatic pitches also arranged in a cycle of fifths. Contrabass strings are arranged in a descending [[chromatic scale]]. Late 19th and early 20th century versions of the instrument were often called 'harp zithers'&nbsp;\u2013 so-named because the pillar extension seemed a miniature version of the harp's pillar. The extra contrabass strings ran parallel to the other strings on these earlier instruments, the diagonal arrangement illustrated developed later to assist the right hand in reaching the strings.\n\nThere are two popular tunings for the modern zither: Munich and Viennese. The ''zither tuning chart'' below, gives tuning details, including pitches and octaves. Munich tuning is on top, and Vienna tuning below. Some players have used Vienna tuning only for the fretted strings, and Munich tuning for the unfretted strings. Full Viennese tuning is normally used only on instruments with 38 or fewer strings.\n\n==Tuning==\nTuning chart for concert and Alpine zithers:\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"font-size: 73%\"\n! scope=\"col 1\" colspan=\"44\"| Zither tuning chart\n|-\n!scope=\"col 1\" colspan=\"2\"|\n! scope=\"col 1\" colspan=\"5\"|Fretted\n! scope=\"col 1\" colspan=\"37\"|Unfretted\n|-\n!scope=\"col 2\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|String\n|colspan=\"5\"|Melody\n|colspan=\"12\"|Accompaniment\n|colspan=\"12\"|Basses\n|colspan=\"13\"|Contrabasses\n|-\n|1\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|5\n|6\n|7\n|8\n|9\n|10\n|11\n|12\n|13\n|14\n|15\n|16\n|17\n|18\n|19\n|20\n|21\n|22\n|23\n|24\n|25\n|26\n|27\n|28\n|29\n|30\n|31\n|32\n|33\n|34\n|35\n|36\n|37\n|38\n|39\n|40\n|41\n|42\n|-\n!scope=\"col 1\" rowspan=\"2\"|Pitch\n!scope=\"col 1\" |Munich\n|A4\n|A4\n|D4\n|G3\n|C3\n|E{{Music|b}}4\n|B{{Music|b}}3\n|F4\n|C4\n|G3\n|D4\n|A3\n|E4\n|B3\n|F{{Music|#}}3\n|C{{Music|#}}4\n|G{{Music|#}}3\n|E{{Music|b}}3\n|B{{Music|b}}2\n|F3\n|C3\n|G2\n|D3\n|A2\n|E3\n|B2\n|F{{Music|#}}2\n|C{{Music|#}}3\n|G{{Music|#}}2\n|F2\n|E2\n|E{{Music|b}}2\n|D2\n|C{{Music|#}}2\n|C2\n|B1\n|B{{Music|b}}1\n|A1\n|G{{Music|#}}1\n|G1\n|F{{Music|#}}1\n|F1\n|-\n!scope=\"col 1\" |Viennese\n|A4\n|D4\n|G4\n|G3\n|C3\n|A{{Music|b}}4\n|E{{Music|b}}4\n|B{{Music|b}}3\n|F4\n|C4\n|G4\n|D4\n|A3\n|E4\n|B3\n|F{{Music|#}}4\n|C{{Music|#}}4\n|G{{Music|#}}3\n|E{{Music|b}}2\n|B{{Music|b}}2\n|F2\n|C3\n|G2\n|D2\n|A2\n|E2\n|B2\n|F{{Music|#}}2\n|C{{Music|#}}2\n|G{{Music|#}}2\n|C2\n|B1\n|B{{Music|b}}1\n|A1\n|G{{Music|#}}\n|G1\n|F{{Music|#}}1\n|F1\n!scope=\"col 4\" colspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"col 2\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 5em\" |Notes:\n|colspan=\"29\"|Basic\n|colspan=\"6\"|Concert\n|colspan=\"7\"|Alpine\n|}\n\n==Playing techniques==\n[[Image:Citrar v Mariboru.JPG|thumb|Zitherist in [[Maribor]], [[Slovenia]]]]\nThe zither is played by plucking the strings while it lies flat on a table (which acts as a resonator to amplify the sound), or it can be held on the lap.\n\nOn concert and Alpine zithers the melody strings are pressed to the fingerboard (\"fretted\") with the fingers of the left hand, and plucked with a [[plectrum]] on the right thumb. First and second fingers of the right hand pluck the accompaniment and bass strings, and the third finger of the right hand plucks the contrabass strings (there are variants on this technique).\n\nThe concept of the chord zither is different from that of the concert and alpine zithers. These instruments may have from 12 to 50 (or more) strings, depending on design. All the strings are played open, in the manner of a harp. The strings on the left are arranged in groups of three or four, which form various chords to be played by the left hand. The strings to the right are single (or pairs of) strings intended for the right hand to pick out the melody. Tuning can vary widely from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from model to model, but is usually indicated on the instrument itself, in the form of chart painted or glued under the strings.\n\n==Contemporary use==\n[[Image:Bulat, Basia (2008) 1.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Basia Bulat]] playing an [[autoharp]]]]\nSince the zither requires advanced technique to play anything more than simple tunes, the vast majority of the concert zithers sold never attained more than amateur or (mostly) ornamental use; the playing of [[Washington Phillips]] was a rare exception. \n\nAs a result, manufacturers attempted to simplify the instrument with various keyboard devices attached to the melody strings ([[Marxophone]], [[dolceola]], [[Celestaphone (instrument)|celestaphone]], [[tremoloa]], etc.).  The invention of the [[autoharp]], which uses bars with felt pads attached underneath placed across and above the strings, is probably the most successful adaptation. However, the absence of a fretboard makes the autoharp a closer relative of the chord zither than the concert zither. Presence of the concert zither in classical music remains sparse.\n\n[[File:Tafelbergliam.jpg|thumb|left|[[Liam Finn]]'s electric drum zither]]\nConcert and Alpine zithers remain in use by a relatively small number of contemporary musicians from various global regions and musical genres, either out of interest in traditional musical styles for the instrument, or from a desire to seek new sounds for their music. New variations on the concert zither have also been employed, including the electric zither\u2014and recent instruments that share zither characteristics, such as the [[Chapman stick]].\n\nWhile use of the concert zither itself has declined, zither music and technique continues to influence contemporary musicians. For example: Canadian musician [[Jeff Healey]], featured in the film thriller ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]]'' in 1989, used a zither technique to play electric guitar. Blind from the age of one, Healey began playing when he was three with the instrument flat on his lap, left hand above the fingerboard in the same manner as a zitherist. Although he used a [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar throughout his career, the instrument was in effect being used as an electric zither.{{clear-left}}\n\n==Notable players==\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Shirley Abicair]]\n*[[Basia Bulat]]\n*[[Dorothy Carter]]\n*[[Anton Karas]]\n*[[F\u00e9lix Lajk\u00f3]]\n*[[Laraaji]]\n*[[Michel de Montaigne]]\n*[[Johann Petzmayer]]\n*[[Washington Phillips]]\n*[[Lee Ranaldo]]\n*[[Wilfried Scharf]]\n*[[John Sebastian]]\n*[[Ruth Welcome]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Adjalin]]\n* [[Autoharp]]\n* [[Baltic psaltery]]\n* [[Dulcimer]]\n* [[Guitar zither]]\n* [[Swarmandal]]\n* [[Ukelin]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Dearling, Robert; ''Stringed Instruments''; Chelsea House Publishing (2000). {{ISBN|0791060926}}\n*[[Sibyl Marcuse|Marcuse, Sibyl]]; ''Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary''; W.

Historically, it has been applied to any instrument of the [[cittern]] family, or to an instrument consisting of many [[string (music)|strings]] stretched across a thin, flat body&nbsp;\u2013 similar to a [[psaltery]]. This article describes the latter variety.<ref name=OED>{{cite web\n|title=zither\n|work=Oxford Dictionaries Online\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|year=2013\n|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/zither\n|accessdate=2013-10-26\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Strings on a table\n|work=Merriam-Webster.com\n|publisher=Merriam-Webster\n|year=2013\n|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/zither\n|accessdate=2013-10-26\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=zither\n|work=Dictionary.com Unabridged\n|publisher=Random House, Inc.\n|year=2013\n|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zither\n|accessdate=2013-10-26\n}}</ref>\n\nZithers are played by strumming or plucking the strings, either with the fingers (sometimes using an accessory called a [[plectrum]] or ''pick''), sounding the strings with a [[Bow (music)|bow]], or, with varieties of the instrument like the [[santur]] or [[cimbalom]], by beating the strings with specially shaped hammers. Like a [[guitar]] or [[lute]], a zither's body serves as a resonating chamber ([[sound box]]), but, unlike guitars and lutes, a zither lacks a distinctly separate [[neck (music)|neck]] assembly. The number of strings varies, from one to more than fifty.\n\nIn modern common usage the term \"zither\" refers to three specific instruments: the '''concert zither''' ({{lang-de|Konzertzither}}), its variant the '''Alpine zither''' (both using a [[Fretted instrument|fretted]] [[fingerboard]]), and the '''chord zither''' (more recently described as a fretless zither or \"guitar zither\"). Concert and Alpine zithers are traditionally found in [[Slovenia]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Epinette des Vosges|France]], north-western [[Croatia]], the southern regions of [[Germany]], alpine Europe, [[Poland]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]]. Emigration from these areas during the 19th century introduced the concert and Alpine zither to North and South America. Chord zithers similar to the instrument in the photograph also became popular in North America during the late 19th and early 20th century. These variants all use metal strings, similar to the cittern.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word 'zither' is derived from Latin [[cythara]], which was used in this form for the title covers on many 16th and 17th century German printed manuscript books originally for the 'cittern'&nbsp;\u2013 from the Greek word [[kithara]], an instrument [[Ancient Greek music|used in Ancient Greece]].<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/zither Zither]</ref> The German scholar [[Michael Praetorius]] mentions an Englishman who came to Germany with a small cittern, ''{{lang|de|einem kleinen Citterlein}}'', in his treatise ''[[Syntagma Musicum]]'', published during the early 17th century.<ref>Praetorius, Michael; ''Syntagma Musicum'':  ''De Organographia Part I and I'' (1619); Oxford University Press; London:  1986. \n 019316406X</ref>  It is not fully understood how 'zitter' or 'zither' came to be applied to the instruments in this article as well as German varieties of the cittern. Other types of zither also existed in Germany, mostly [[drone zither]]s like the [[scheitholt]] (which was mentioned by Praetorius) or [[Hummel (instrument)|hummel]], but these generally have their own individual regional names and may have been in use before the introduction into the [[lexicon]] of 'cythara' and its German derivative [[cognate]].\n\n== Organology ==\nThe [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] system, an academic instrument classification method, also uses the term ''zither'' to classify all stringed instruments in which the strings do not extend beyond the [[sounding box]]. This includes such diverse instruments as the [[hammered dulcimer]], [[psaltery]], [[Appalachian dulcimer]], [[guqin]], [[guzheng]], [[tromba marina]], [[Koto (musical instrument)|koto]], [[gusli]], [[Kanun (instrument)|kanun]], [[kankl\u0117s]], [[kantele]], [[kannel]], [[kokles]], [[valiha]], [[gayageum]], [[\u0111\u00e0n tranh]], [[autoharp]], [[santoor]], [[yangqin]], [[santur]], [[swarmandal]], and others. [[Pedal steel guitar]]s, [[Lap steel guitar|lap guitars]] (where the neck serves no separate function other than to extend the string length), and [[keyboard instruments]] like the [[clavichord]], [[harpsichord]] and [[piano]] also fall within this broad categorical use.<ref>Hornbostel,Erich M. von and Sachs, Curt; ''Classification of Musical Instruments'': Translated from the Original German by Anthony Baines and Klaus P. Wachsmann; '''The Galpin Society Journal''', Vol. 14; March 1961, pp. 3-29</ref>\n\nThe word has also been used in conjunction with brand varieties of other string instruments, for example the zither [[banjo]].<ref>[https://creekdontrise.com/acoustic/zither_banjo/shlomo/shlomos_english_zither_banjo_article.htm Pestcoe, Schlomo; ''The English Zither Banjo'']</ref>\n\n==History and development==\n[[File:Lian Zhu Shi.jpg|left|thumb|65px|Chinese [[Guqin]] with seven strings]][[File:79-tone Kanun on the couch.jpg|thumb|Turkish Qanun with 79 strings]]\n\nAlthough there is evidence that a kanun was found in Mycenaean Greece, dating back to 1600BC, the earliest known surviving instrument of the zither family is a Chinese [[guqin]], a fretless instrument, found in the [[tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng]] dating from 433&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/XXIV/3/375.pdf|title=Source and stream: early music and living traditions in China|author=Stephen Jones|publisher=[[Oxford Journals]]}}</ref> Similar instruments along this design were developed over the following centuries, for example: the Japanese silk strung [[Koto (instrument)|koto]], the [[siter]] of Indonesian [[gamelan]]s; the [[Qanun (instrument)|Q\u0101n\u016bn (or Kanun)]] of Greece and the Middle East; the [[valiha]], a tube zither of Madagascar; and many others. Increasing interest in '[[world music]]' has brought wider recognition to these other zither family members, both ancient and modern. Many of these instruments have been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] electronically, and are available in instrument banks for music [[synthesizers]].\n\n[[File:Scheitholt instrument.jpg|thumb|170px|Alpine Scheitholt]]\nIn Europe and other more northern and western regions, early zithers were more similar to the modern [[mountain dulcimer]], having long, usually rectangular, sound boxes, with one or more melody strings and several unfretted [[drone (music)|drone]] strings. Some of these employed movable bridges similar to the Japanese koto, used for retuning the drone strings. The Alpine ''[[Scheitholt (musical instrument)|Scheitholt]]'' furnishes an example of this older type of European zither. By the late 18th century, two principal varieties of European concert zither had developed, known as the ''[[Salzburg]] zither'' (with a rounded side away from the player), and the ''[[Mittenwald]] zither'' (with both sides rounded). Both styles are still found in concert zithers today, although the Salzburg style has become by far the most common.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Zither |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/657593/zither |encyclopedia=britannica.com}}</ref>\n[[File:009 Landleute bei Aussee in Steiermark.jpg|thumb|Zitherist before 1850 in [[Bad Aussee|Ausseerland]], [[Styria]], playing a ''Salzburg''-style instrument]]\nThe zither became a popular folk music instrument in Bavaria and Austria and, at the beginning of the 19th century, was known as a ''{{lang|de|Volkszither}}''.\n \nViennese zitherist [[Johann Petzmayer]] (1803\u20131884) became one of the outstanding virtuosi on these early instruments and is credited with making the zither a household instrument.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|url=http://www.zithers-usa.com/History.htm |title=History |publisher=www.zithers-usa.com |accessdate=6 June 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303220457/http://www.zithers-usa.com/History.htm |archivedate=3 March 2016 }}</ref>\nIn 1838, Nikolaus Weigel of Munich conceived the idea of adopting fixed bridges, adding additional strings, tuning them in the cycle of fifths, and chromatically fretting the fingerboard&nbsp;\u2013 effectively converting a rather crude folk instrument into the concert zither. His ideas were not, however, widely accepted until 1862, when luthier Max Amberger of Munich fabricated a new zither based on Weigel's design.<ref name=\"history\"/> At this point the zither had reached something very close to its modern concert form. Within a relatively short time the new design had largely replaced the old Volkszither (though still called by the same name among folk musicians) throughout central Europe, particularly in the [[Alpine states|Alpine countries]]. As the 'concert zither' it also began to attract the attention of serious composers, a number of whom, themselves, became concert zither virtuosi. These composers, called the \"''{{lang|de|Altmeister}}''\", flourished between 1870 and 1910. And no less a composer than [[Johann Strauss II]] gave the instrument a prominent solo in one of his most famous waltzes, \"[[Tales from the Vienna Woods]]\".<ref group = nb>The part is sometimes played on a mandolin, when a zither is not available.</ref>\n\nThe zither went through two periods of great popularity in the United States. The first of these was in the late 19th through early 20th century, when it was greatly in vogue as a [[parlour]] instrument in many homes. During that period, a number of U.S.-based instrument manufacturers, many of them founded by, or staffed with, European (and especially German and Austrian) luthiers, were producing concert zithers. Chord zithers were often marketed under confusing brand names like '[[guitar zither]]' or 'mandoline zither'. The recently rediscovered recordings of the gospel singer [[Washington Phillips]], who used two instruments simultaneously, have revealed the virtuosic capability of the chord zither to modern musicians seeking to revive it. By the 1920s, this popularity had begun to wane, as other string instruments (notably guitars) increased in popularity along with the new fashion for [[jazz music]].\n\nIn the 1950s, interest in zithers resurfaced due in great measure to the success of the 1949 British [[film noir]] ''[[The Third Man]]''. The [[soundtrack]] music for the film, which featured only a concert zither (no other instruments)&nbsp;\u2013 was performed by the Viennese musician [[Anton Karas]]. His \"[[The Third Man Theme]]\" was released as a single in 1949\u201350 and became a best-seller in the UK.<ref name=\"time1949\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,856412,00.html Music: Zither Dither], a 28 November 1949 article from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine</ref> Following its release in the U.S. in 1950, it spent eleven weeks at number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s U.S. [[Best Sellers in Stores]] Chart from April 29th to July 8th.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tsort.info/music/3hq6ab.htm |title=Song title 199 - Third Man Theme |publisher=Tsort.info |date=2007-10-08 |accessdate=2013-06-24}}</ref> The exposure made Karas an international star.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/movienews/index/?cid=157596 \"The Third Man\" DVD review], Sean Axmaker, ''Turner Classic Movies''.</ref> A ''Time'' magazine film preview stated that \"the famous musical score by Anton Karas\" would have the audience \"in a dither with his zither\".<ref name=\"ultimatetrailer\">''The Ultimate Trailer Show''. HDNet, 22 September 2010.</ref>\n\nThis new popularity for the zither lasted until well into the 1960s with many successful albums during the period from performers such as Karas, [[Ruth Welcome]], and [[Shirley Abicair]]. German-born American Ruth Welcome released a number of very popular theme-based zither albums between 1958 and 1965 (e.g., ''Romantic Zither''; ''Zither South of the Border''; ''Zither Goes to Hollywood''). Australian-born singer Shirley Abicair popularised the chord zither when she used it for accompaniment in her TV shows, live performances and recordings in Britain in the 1950s and '60s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2013/sep/04/101-strangest-spotify-ruth-welcome|title=The 101 strangest records on Spotify: Ruth Welcome \u2013 Romantic Zither|first=Rob|last=Fitzpatrick|date=4 September 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/843632-Ruth-Welcome|title=Ruth Welcome|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref> Zither music also featured in a ''Twilight Zone'' episode&nbsp;\u2013 [[Mr Bevis]] in 1960.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.springfieldspringfield.co.uk/view_episode_scripts.php?tv-show=the-twilight-zone-1959&episode=s01e33|title=The Twilight Zone (1959) s01e33 Episode Script - SS|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlthough interest in the zither had once more begun to wane by the late 1960s, owing to the two American vogues there are still many used instruments to be found, in various states of disrepair.  It has become something of a truism that most zithers seen today are either 60 or 110 years old.  Currently (2019) only a few independent luthiers and mid-European makers are producing new instruments.\n\n==Concert and Alpine zithers==\nA '''concert zither''' may have from 29 to 38 strings, with 34 or 35 being most typical. These are arranged as follows: four or five fretted melody strings, placed above a guitar-like fretboard; 12 unfretted \"accompaniment\" strings; followed by 12 unfretted \"bass\" strings; followed by a varying number of \"contrabass\" strings, with five or six being the most common number.\n[[File:Ft.Slocum.1865.zither.jpg|thumb|German Concert Zither at Ft. Slocum, Nov. 1865]]\n[[Image:Zither.png|left|thumb|'''Concert zither''', with a fretted fingerboard. This variety is a ''discant Salzburger Konzertzither'']]\n\nOn some older zithers, one may find \"half-frets\" above the 12th fret, which extend only under the first two or three strings. This results in the lower fretted strings having no pitches (or no ''[[chromatic]]'' pitches) available above the 12th fret, while the higher fretted strings still have higher chromatic pitches available at these half-frets. Nearly all instruments made after 1960, however, have full-length frets all the way up the fretboard.\n\nAnton Karas and Ruth Welcome used instruments of similar design to the one illustrated. After World War II, Karas (according to zither scholar G\u00fcnter Wittenstein, who was acquainted with him) performed on an instrument of larger dimensions than normal&nbsp;\u2013 with a 43&nbsp;cm standard scale length for the fingerboard strings. He used Viennese tuning (see below), but with an altered chromatic sequence for the fingerboard and open strings. The accompaniment strings G and F{{Music|#}} were tuned an octave higher, while contrabass strings tuned E{{Music|b}}, F, D, E, C{{Music|#}} replaced the regular [[cycle of fifths]] bass strings. This brought the contrabasses closer to the fingerboard where the player could reach them more easily.\n\nFor ''The Third Man'', Karas tuned the zither a [[semi-tone]] lower, giving a particularly distinctive tone to the contrabass strings. The resulting lower string tension also enabled Karas to perform an expressive vibrato on the fingerboard melody strings. Film director [[Carol Reed]], (on whose oak kitchen table the music was performed), described the sound as \"gritty and dirty\", perfectly reflecting the atmospheric mood of the film.\n\n[[Image:MIDPTR 619a 2005 rotated contrast-enhanced.jpg|right|thumb|An '''Alpine Zither'''.  Note the \"harp post\" at the top of the image.]]\nThe '''Alpine zither''' has 42 strings, and differs from the concert zither primarily in requiring the addition of an extension to the body of the instrument to support both the longer additional contrabass strings and their tuners.\n\nAlpine zithers are tuned in a similar manner to the concert zither, with the accompaniment and bass strings each providing a full set of 12 chromatic pitches also arranged in a cycle of fifths. Contrabass strings are arranged in a descending [[chromatic scale]]. Late 19th and early 20th century versions of the instrument were often called 'harp zithers'&nbsp;\u2013 so-named because the pillar extension seemed a miniature version of the harp's pillar. The extra contrabass strings ran parallel to the other strings on these earlier instruments, the diagonal arrangement illustrated developed later to assist the right hand in reaching the strings.\n\nThere are two popular tunings for the modern zither: Munich and Viennese. The ''zither tuning chart'' below, gives tuning details, including pitches and octaves. Munich tuning is on top, and Vienna tuning below. Some players have used Vienna tuning only for the fretted strings, and Munich tuning for the unfretted strings. Full Viennese tuning is normally used only on instruments with 38 or fewer strings.\n\n==Tuning==\nTuning chart for concert and Alpine zithers:\n{|class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"font-size: 73%\"\n! scope=\"col 1\" colspan=\"44\"| Zither tuning chart\n|-\n!scope=\"col 1\" colspan=\"2\"|\n! scope=\"col 1\" colspan=\"5\"|Fretted\n! scope=\"col 1\" colspan=\"37\"|Unfretted\n|-\n!scope=\"col 2\" colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"|String\n|colspan=\"5\"|Melody\n|colspan=\"12\"|Accompaniment\n|colspan=\"12\"|Basses\n|colspan=\"13\"|Contrabasses\n|-\n|1\n|2\n|3\n|4\n|5\n|6\n|7\n|8\n|9\n|10\n|11\n|12\n|13\n|14\n|15\n|16\n|17\n|18\n|19\n|20\n|21\n|22\n|23\n|24\n|25\n|26\n|27\n|28\n|29\n|30\n|31\n|32\n|33\n|34\n|35\n|36\n|37\n|38\n|39\n|40\n|41\n|42\n|-\n!scope=\"col 1\" rowspan=\"2\"|Pitch\n!scope=\"col 1\" |Munich\n|A4\n|A4\n|D4\n|G3\n|C3\n|E{{Music|b}}4\n|B{{Music|b}}3\n|F4\n|C4\n|G3\n|D4\n|A3\n|E4\n|B3\n|F{{Music|#}}3\n|C{{Music|#}}4\n|G{{Music|#}}3\n|E{{Music|b}}3\n|B{{Music|b}}2\n|F3\n|C3\n|G2\n|D3\n|A2\n|E3\n|B2\n|F{{Music|#}}2\n|C{{Music|#}}3\n|G{{Music|#}}2\n|F2\n|E2\n|E{{Music|b}}2\n|D2\n|C{{Music|#}}2\n|C2\n|B1\n|B{{Music|b}}1\n|A1\n|G{{Music|#}}1\n|G1\n|F{{Music|#}}1\n|F1\n|-\n!scope=\"col 1\" |Viennese\n|A4\n|D4\n|G4\n|G3\n|C3\n|A{{Music|b}}4\n|E{{Music|b}}4\n|B{{Music|b}}3\n|F4\n|C4\n|G4\n|D4\n|A3\n|E4\n|B3\n|F{{Music|#}}4\n|C{{Music|#}}4\n|G{{Music|#}}3\n|E{{Music|b}}2\n|B{{Music|b}}2\n|F2\n|C3\n|G2\n|D2\n|A2\n|E2\n|B2\n|F{{Music|#}}2\n|C{{Music|#}}2\n|G{{Music|#}}2\n|C2\n|B1\n|B{{Music|b}}1\n|A1\n|G{{Music|#}}\n|G1\n|F{{Music|#}}1\n|F1\n!scope=\"col 4\" colspan=\"4\"|\n|-\n!scope=\"col 2\" colspan=\"2\" style=\"padding-left: 5em\" |Notes:\n|colspan=\"29\"|Basic\n|colspan=\"6\"|Concert\n|colspan=\"7\"|Alpine\n|}\n\n==Playing techniques==\n[[Image:Citrar v Mariboru.JPG|thumb|Zitherist in [[Maribor]], [[Slovenia]]]]\nThe zither is played by plucking the strings while it lies flat on a table (which acts as a resonator to amplify the sound), or it can be held on the lap.\n\nOn concert and Alpine zithers the melody strings are pressed to the fingerboard (\"fretted\") with the fingers of the left hand, and plucked with a [[plectrum]] on the right thumb. First and second fingers of the right hand pluck the accompaniment and bass strings, and the third finger of the right hand plucks the contrabass strings (there are variants on this technique).\n\nThe concept of the chord zither is different from that of the concert and alpine zithers. These instruments may have from 12 to 50 (or more) strings, depending on design. All the strings are played open, in the manner of a harp. The strings on the left are arranged in groups of three or four, which form various chords to be played by the left hand. The strings to the right are single (or pairs of) strings intended for the right hand to pick out the melody. Tuning can vary widely from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from model to model, but is usually indicated on the instrument itself, in the form of chart painted or glued under the strings.\n\n==Contemporary use==\n[[Image:Bulat, Basia (2008) 1.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Basia Bulat]] playing an [[autoharp]]]]\nSince the zither requires advanced technique to play anything more than simple tunes, the vast majority of the concert zithers sold never attained more than amateur or (mostly) ornamental use; the playing of [[Washington Phillips]] was a rare exception. \n\nAs a result, manufacturers attempted to simplify the instrument with various keyboard devices attached to the melody strings ([[Marxophone]], [[dolceola]], [[Celestaphone (instrument)|celestaphone]], [[tremoloa]], etc.).  The invention of the [[autoharp]], which uses bars with felt pads attached underneath placed across and above the strings, is probably the most successful adaptation. However, the absence of a fretboard makes the autoharp a closer relative of the chord zither than the concert zither. Presence of the concert zither in classical music remains sparse.\n\n[[File:Tafelbergliam.jpg|thumb|left|[[Liam Finn]]'s electric drum zither]]\nConcert and Alpine zithers remain in use by a relatively small number of contemporary musicians from various global regions and musical genres, either out of interest in traditional musical styles for the instrument, or from a desire to seek new sounds for their music. New variations on the concert zither have also been employed, including the electric zither\u2014and recent instruments that share zither characteristics, such as the [[Chapman stick]].\n\nWhile use of the concert zither itself has declined, zither music and technique continues to influence contemporary musicians. For example: Canadian musician [[Jeff Healey]], featured in the film thriller ''[[Road House (1989 film)|Road House]]'' in 1989, used a zither technique to play electric guitar. Blind from the age of one, Healey began playing when he was three with the instrument flat on his lap, left hand above the fingerboard in the same manner as a zitherist. Although he used a [[Fender Stratocaster]] guitar throughout his career, the instrument was in effect being used as an electric zither.{{clear-left}}\n\n==Notable players==\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*[[Shirley Abicair]]\n*[[Basia Bulat]]\n*[[Dorothy Carter]]\n*[[Anton Karas]]\n*[[F\u00e9lix Lajk\u00f3]]\n*[[Laraaji]]\n*[[Michel de Montaigne]]\n*[[Johann Petzmayer]]\n*[[Washington Phillips]]\n*[[Lee Ranaldo]]\n*[[Wilfried Scharf]]\n*[[John Sebastian]]\n*[[Ruth Welcome]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Adjalin]]\n* [[Autoharp]]\n* [[Baltic psaltery]]\n* [[Dulcimer]]\n* [[Guitar zither]]\n* [[Swarmandal]]\n* [[Ukelin]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=nb}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Dearling, Robert; ''Stringed Instruments''; Chelsea House Publishing (2000). {{ISBN|0791060926}}\n*[[Sibyl Marcuse|Marcuse, Sibyl]]; ''Musical Instruments: A Comprehensive Dictionary''; W.

A flood has not overtopped the bridge since construction.

It is the archetypal example of the application of the new technology by [[Percy Allan]] to the construction of timber road bridges in [[New South Wales]] during a major development phase for bridge and road construction during the last decade of the nineteenth century.<ref name = \"significance\">{{cite web | year = 1998 | url = http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/Hansard/1998/week07/2016.htm | title = Legislative Assembly for the ACT: 1998 Week 7 Hansard (22 September), p. 2016 | publisher = ACT Government| accessdate = 25 October 2006}}</ref> \n\nTharwa Bridge is highly valued by the local community as an integral part of the village of Tharwa. It continues to contribute in social, economic and aesthetic terms to the community. The bridge and its site have associative significance with the period of nineteenth century European settlement and development of the region.\n\n== Maintenance and closures ==\n[[File:Allen Truss bridge at Thawa.jpg|thumb|Looking at the Tharwa Bridge, showing the single lane]]\n\nAn engineering assessment of the bridge was undertaken in 1978 by structural engineering firm [[Hardcastle & Richards]], which resulted in some upgrades. However, the bridge subsequently deteriorated.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Australia.

During July and August 2005, Tharwa Bridge was strengthened with [[Bailey bridge|bailey panels]] to provide a temporary crossing for vehicles up to five tonne.  This arrangement was to have been in place until 2008.\n\nIn September 2006 ACT Roads advised that the Tharwa Bridge would be closed for three months, and later announcing the bridge was to be closed for an indefinite period. Barriers were put in place to close off the bridge to road, cycle and pedestrian traffic. Traffic for was diverted north to Point Hut low level crossing. In the event of that crossing being closed due to flooding, the only other high level bridge in the area is at the Cotter.\n\nIn October 2006 the ACT Government announced its decision to construct a single lane concrete bridge with a pedestrian walkway adjacent to the existing bridge. Construction was intended to begin in 2007, however this plan was abandoned in favour of a decision to restore the old bridge, with construction getting underway in April 2008.<ref name=\"new bridge\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.roads.act.gov.au/bridges/new_bridge_for_tharwa | title = New Bridge for Tharwa | publisher = Roads ACT | accessdate = 25 October 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe bridge was reopened in August 2008 to light traffic less than 5 tonnes.<ref name=\"Bridge open\">{{cite web | year = 2008 | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/tharwa-bridge-to-reopen-today-for-light-traffic/1256207.aspx | title = Tharwa Bridge to reopen today for light traffic | publisher = Canberra Times | accessdate = 18 March 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208033638/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/tharwa-bridge-to-reopen-today-for-light-traffic/1256207.aspx | archivedate = 8 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sign Posted Bridge Restrictions in the ACT|url=http://www.tccs.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/383694/Sign_posted_bridge_restrictions.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe second phase of the project was completed in February 2010 with the foundations improved to withstand major flooding.

A flood has not overtopped the bridge since construction. There is a mark on the concrete pier on the Western side of the river showing the flood level in 1991.\n\n== Heritage ==\n[[File:Murrumbidgee river tharwa bridge.jpg|left|thumb|Tharwa Bridge and the [[Murrumbidgee River]] after rain, 2005 (looking South); Tharwa is to the right.]]\nThe bridge was entered in the ACT Heritage Register<ref>{{Cite web | title = 20036.

It is the archetypal example of the application of the new technology by [[Percy Allan]] to the construction of timber road bridges in [[New South Wales]] during a major development phase for bridge and road construction during the last decade of the nineteenth century.<ref name = \"significance\">{{cite web | year = 1998 | url = http://www.hansard.act.gov.au/Hansard/1998/week07/2016.htm | title = Legislative Assembly for the ACT: 1998 Week 7 Hansard (22 September), p. 2016 | publisher = ACT Government| accessdate = 25 October 2006}}</ref> \n\nTharwa Bridge is highly valued by the local community as an integral part of the village of Tharwa. It continues to contribute in social, economic and aesthetic terms to the community. The bridge and its site have associative significance with the period of nineteenth century European settlement and development of the region.\n\n== Closure and restoration ==\n=== 2005 ===\n[[File:Allen Truss bridge at Thawa.jpg|thumb|Looking at the Tharwa Bridge, showing the single lane]]\n\nAn engineering assessment of the bridge was undertaken in 1978 by structural engineering firm [[Hardcastle & Richards]], which resulted in some upgrades. However, the bridge subsequently deteriorated.<ref>{{Citation | author1=Australia.

During July and August 2005, Tharwa Bridge was strengthened with [[Bailey bridge|bailey panels]] to provide a temporary crossing for vehicles up to five tonne.  This arrangement was to have been in place until 2008.\n\n=== 2006 ===\nIn September 2006 ACT Roads advised that the Tharwa Bridge would be closed for three months, and later announcing the bridge was to be closed for an indefinite period. Barriers were put in place to close off the bridge to road, cycle and pedestrian traffic. Traffic for was diverted north to Point Hut low level crossing. In the event of that crossing being closed due to flooding, the only other high level bridge in the area is at the Cotter.\n\nIn October 2006 the ACT Government announced its decision to construct a single lane concrete bridge with a pedestrian walkway adjacent to the existing bridge. Construction was intended to begin in 2007, however this plan was abandoned in favour of a decision to restore the old bridge, with construction getting underway in April 2008.<ref name=\"new bridge\">{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.roads.act.gov.au/bridges/new_bridge_for_tharwa | title = New Bridge for Tharwa | publisher = Roads ACT | accessdate = 25 October 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe bridge was reopened in August 2008 to light traffic less than 5 tonnes.<ref name=\"Bridge open\">{{cite web | year = 2008 | url = http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/tharwa-bridge-to-reopen-today-for-light-traffic/1256207.aspx | title = Tharwa Bridge to reopen today for light traffic | publisher = Canberra Times | accessdate = 18 March 2009 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081208033638/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/local/news/general/tharwa-bridge-to-reopen-today-for-light-traffic/1256207.aspx | archivedate = 8 December 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sign Posted Bridge Restrictions in the ACT|url=http://www.tccs.act.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/383694/Sign_posted_bridge_restrictions.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe second phase of the project was completed in February 2010 with the foundations improved to withstand major flooding.
