Known for its location on the [[Cantabrian Sea]], as well as for the outlet of the River Sella, Ribadesella is a town that forms part of the [[Picos de Europa]] (Peaks of Europe). It is bordered on the east by [[Llanes]], on the south by Cangas de On\u00eds and Parres, and on the west by Caravia. Ribadesella is hometown to [[Queen Letizia of Spain]].\n\nThe first weekend of August, the Descenso Internacional del Sella (International Descent of the Sella) takes place, where kayakers from all over the world gather to attempt the final 20&nbsp;km of the [[Sella (river)|Sella River]] in record time. This town is also known for its prehistoric cave, known as the cave of [[Tito Bustillo Cave|Tito Bustillo]], which is open to visitors year round. Ribadesella is also visited for its history, sport activities, scenery, nature, and food. {{fact|date=January 2019}}{{tone-inline|date=January 2019}}\n\n==History==\n\nThe municipality includes the [[Tito Bustillo Cave]] (Cueva de Tito Bustillo), known for prehistoric wall paintings of animals and figures, probably dating from the Magdalenian age (29,000 years ago).\n\nThe first written references to the settlement are more recent, and date from the first century BC. These come from the Greek geographer [[Strabo]], who speaks of the River \"Noega\" separating \"the Astures of Cantabrians\". The people of Ribadesella at this time were called the Salaenos: they dominated Colunga, Arriondas and Llanes.\n\n==The town==\n\nRibadesella has two main streets, the Gran V\u00eda de Agustin Arg\u00fcelles, and CalleComercio.  In this part of Ribadesella, there are a few banks, pharmacies, restaurants/bars, stores, and newspaper stands. Here also lies the Casco Antiguo, where the old plaza is located, as well as Ribadesella's church: Iglesia Parroquial de Sta. Mar\u00eda Magdalena. In this part of town lie small stores of homemade products, as well as the homes of Ribadesella's inhabitants. The third part of Ribadesella consists of the Paseo Mar\u00edtimo del Puerto, or the coast of the town that lies near the water. Today, this paseo is dedicated to the [[Queen of Spain]], D\u00aa [[Letizia Ortiz]].\n\n==Parishes==\n*[[Berbes]]\n*[[Collera]]\n*[[Junco (Ribadesella)|Junco]]\n*[[Leces]]\n*[[Linares (Ribadesella)|Linares]]\n*[[Moro (Ribadesella)|Moro]]\n*[[Ribadesella (parish)|Ribadesella]] (Capital)\n*[[Santianes (Ribadesella)|Santianes]]\n*[[Ucio]]\n\n==Cultural events==\n\nThe International Descent of the Sella (<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.descensodelsella.com/?lang=en|title=Descenso Internacional del Sella|website=www.descensodelsella.com|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>Descenso Internacional del Sella) is a race that takes place every year on the first weekend of August on the banks of the River Sella, and is accompanied by a celebratory gathering (La Fiesta de Les Pirag\u00fces), through the streets and plaza of Ribadesella. The race begins in Arriondas, and finishes at the end of the River Sella, located in the \u201ccenter\u201d of Ribadesella.\n\nOther festivals are celebrated with food, music, and dancing with original bagpipe/Asturiano music and folklore clothing. These festivals include religious celebrations for San Ant\u00f3n de Cuerres, San Jos\u00e9 de Sebre\u00f1u, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de F\u00e1tima de Toriellu, San Isidro, San Lorenzo, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Asunci\u00f3n, Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Esperanza de Collera, and Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Gu\u00eda, the patron of the fisherman.  The Feria del Queso (cheese festival) de Cuerres and La Fiesta del Pez (fish festival) de Tere\u00f1es are other festivals celebrated throughout Ribadesella. Semana Santa, or Easter week is very important in Ribadesella. Processions are carried out daily, and great celebration, including a horse race/spectacular on the Santa Marina beach is held each year. <ref>{{cite web |title=International Descent of the Sella |url=http://www.descensodelsella.com/?lang=en |website=International Descent of the Sella |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Events==\n\nDescent of the Sella.\n\nThe \"Guia\".\n\n{{Parishes in Ribadesella}}\n{{Municipalities of Asturias}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Municipalities in Asturias]]\n[[Category:Parishes in Ribadesella|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=January 2013}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement\n| name                    = Ribadesella\n| settlement_type         = [[Municipalities of Spain|Municipality]]\n| official_name           = <!-- if different from name -->\n| native_name             = <!-- if different from name -->\n| image_skyline           = Ribadesella-playa.jpg\n| image_alt               =\n| image_caption           =\n| image_flag              = Bandera de Ribadesella.svg\n| image_shield            = Coat of Arms of Ribadesella.svg\n| nickname                =\n| motto                   =\n| image_map               = Ribesella Asturies map.svg\n| map_caption             = Location of Ribadesella\n| pushpin_map             = Spain\n| pushpin_label_position  =\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Spain\n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = {{flag|Spain}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous community]]\n| subdivision_name1       = {{flag|Asturias}}\n| subdivision_type2       = [[Provinces of Spain|Province]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Asturias]]\n| subdivision_type3       = [[Comarcas of Spain|Comarca]]\n| subdivision_name3       = [[Oriente (Asturian comarca)|Oriente]]\n| seat_type               = [[Capital (political)|Capital]]\n| seat                    = Ribadesella\n| coordinates             = {{coord|43|27|45|N|5|3|30|W|region:ES_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n| coordinates_footnotes   =\n| elevation_m             = 897\n| elevation_min_m         =\n| elevation_max_m         =\n| area_footnotes          =\n| area_total_km2          = 84.37\n| established_title       = <!-- Founded -->\n| established_date        =\n| population_as_of        = {{Spain metadata Wikidata|population_as_of}}\n| population_footnotes    = {{Spain metadata Wikidata|population_footnotes}}\n| population_total        = {{Spain metadata Wikidata|population_total}}\n| population_demonym      = riosellano \n| population_note         =\n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| blank_name_sec1         = [[Languages of Spain|Official language(s)]]\n| blank_info_sec1         = Asturian\n| timezone                = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n| utc_offset              = +1\n| timezone_DST            = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n| utc_offset_DST          = +2\n| postal_code_type        = [[List of postal codes in Spain|Postal code]]\n| postal_code             = 33560\n| area_code_type          = [[Telephone numbers in Spain|Dialing code]]\n| area_code               =\n| leader_title            = [[Alcalde]]\n| leader_name             = Ram\u00f3n Manuel Canal Tirador\n| leader_party            = [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]]\n| website                 = {{official website|http://www.ayto-ribadesella.es/}}\n| footnotes               =\n}}\n{{Expand Spanish|topic=geo|Ribadesella|date=April 2009}}\n\n'''Ribadesella''' (Asturian: Ribeseya) is a small (84 km2) municipality in the Autonomous Community of the Principality of [[Asturias]], Spain.

Raised at the French court, Antoine would campaign in Italy twice, once under [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] and the other with [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. During the German Peasants' War, he would defeat two armies while retaking Saverne and Selestat. Antoine succeeded in freeing Lorraine from the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with the Treaty of Nuremberg of 1542. In 1544, while Antoine suffered from an illness, the Duchy of Lorraine was invaded by Emperor Charles V's army on their way to attack France. Fleeing the imperial armies, Antoine was taken to [[Duchy of Lorraine|Bar-le-Duc]] where he died.\n\n==Biography==\nAntoine was born at [[Bar-le-Duc]], the son of [[Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine]] and [[Philippa of Guelders]].{{sfn|Carroll|2009|p=310}} He spent seven years{{sfn|Bietenholz|2003|p=349}} at the court of [[Louis XII of France|King Louis XII]] together with his brother Claude,{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=38}} and became friends with the Duke of Angoul\u00eame, the future King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]].{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|p=108}} In 1530, a transaction between Antoine and his brother, [[Claude, Duke of Guise|Claude]], divided the family possessions, with Antoine getting the duchies of Lorraine and Bar while Claude would get the duchy of Guise.{{sfn|Carroll|2009|p=24}}\n\nIn 1509 he entrusted the reins of the Duchy to his mother and Hugues des Hazards, [[bishop of Toul]], and followed Louis XII in [[Italian Wars|his campaign in northern Italy]], where he took part in the [[Battle of Agnadello]] of that year.{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|p=108}} After Louis' death, he went back to Italy under Francis I, participating in the [[battle of Marignano]] (14/15 September 1515).{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|p=109}} However, called back home by problems in Lorraine, he was absent at the decisive [[battle of Pavia]] (1525), in which Francis was taken prisoner and his brother Fran\u00e7ois, count of Lambesc, was killed.{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|p=109}}\n\n==Peasant war==\nIn Lorraine, Antoine had to face the spreading of [[Protestant Reformation]], against which he published an edict on 26 December 1523.{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|p=110}} The situation worsened the following year, when a rebellion, known as [[German Peasants' War]], broke out in [[Alsace]].{{sfn|Blickle|1981|p=165}} The insurrectionists captured [[Saverne]] and tried to conquer [[Saint-Di\u00e9]], while the peasants of [[Bitscherland]] also rose in May 1525. Antoine launched an expedition which massacred a peasant army at Saverne on 16 May{{sfn|Berc\u00e9|1987|p=156}} and on 20 May he decisively defeated another peasant army near [[S\u00e9lestat]].{{sfn|von Greyerz|1980|p=45}}\n\n==Duchy legal status==\nDespite remaining neutral in the wars between France and the Holy Roman Empire, Antoine sent his son Francis to the French court and by 1527 was attempting to marry him to [[Anne of Cleves]].{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=45}} In an effort to improve his relations with German lords, Antoine sent a few hundred soldiers to fight against the Ottomans at the [[Siege of Vienna]] in 1529.{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=45}} Antoine dispatched legal envoys to the Imperial diet, in 1532, seeking clarification of the duchy of Lorraine's legal status within the Holy Roman Empire to no avail.{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=46}}\n\nIn 1538, Antoine claimed the titles of [[Duke of Guelders]] and [[Count of Zutphen]] upon the death of [[Charles of Egmond]], but was unable to gain possession of them.{{sfn|Warnicke|2000|p=82}} He married his heir, Francis to [[Christina of Denmark]], niece of Charles V, in 1541,{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=45-46}} and with the Treaty of Nuremberg (26 August 1542), Antoine obtained from Charles V the independence of the Duchy of Lorraine.{{sfn|Lipp|2011|p=20}} He interceded at the start of Francis and Charles' [[Italian War of 1542\u20131546|war in 1542]] as a peace envoy, visiting Charles in person, but due to gout sent his heir to Francis.{{sfn|Monter|2007|p=47}} In fact, Antoine asked his niece, [[Mary of Guise]], to send him a Scottish [[hackney horse]] which he hoped would be easier to ride with his [[gout]].{{sfn|Wood|1923|p=33-34}}\n\nIn May of 1544, Charles V's army marches into Lorraine as part of a plan to invade France, while [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] attacks France from the north from Calais.{{sfn|Tucker|2010|p=511-512}} Weakened by an illness, Antoine is unable to respond.{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|p=117}} He is taken to Bar-le-Duc where he dies on 14 June 1544.{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|p=117}}\n\n==Family==\nOn 26 June 1515, he married [[Ren\u00e9e of Bourbon]], daughter of [[Gilbert, Count of Montpensier|Gilbert de Bourbon, Count of Montpensier]] and [[Clara Gonzaga]].{{sfn|Bogdan|2013|p=109}}\n\nThey had six children:\n\n* [[Francis I, Duke of Lorraine]] (1517\u20131545){{sfn|Carroll|2009|p=310}}\n* [[Nicholas, Duke of Merc\u0153ur]] (1524\u20131577){{sfn|Carroll|2009|p=310}}\n* Jean (1526\u20131532)\n* Antoine (b. 1528), d. young\n* [[Anna of Lorraine|Anna]] (1522\u20131568), married firstly [[Ren\u00e9 of Ch\u00e2lon]], [[Prince of Orange]],{{sfn|Braye|1924|p=7}} and secondly [[Philip II, Duke of Aerschot]] (1496\u20131549){{sfn|Ward|Prothero|Leathes|1911|p=table 34}}\n* Elisabeth (b. 1530), d. young\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe; \n|1= 1.

Founded in June 2015, the team made its debut in the [[Major Arena Soccer League]] with the [[2015\u201316 Major Arena Soccer League season|2015\u201316 season]].<ref name=\"crgz150611\"/><ref name=\"kgan150611\"/> The team's name and logo were revealed at a press conference on July 16, 2015.<ref name=\"crgz150716\"/><ref name=\"kwwl150716\"/>\n\nThe team shared its ownership group with the [[Cedar Rapids Titans]] of the [[Indoor Football League]],<ref name=\"crgz150611\"/><ref name=\"kwwl150716\"/> and sponsored an outdoor team the [[Cedar Rapids Rampage United]] that were a part of the [[Premier League of America]].<ref>http://cedarrapidsrampage.com/archives/838#more-838</ref>\n\n==History==\nFormer [[Chicago Storm]] assistant and [[Rockford Rampage]] head coach Jeff Kraft was named the first head coach in franchise history. In the first home pre-season match in Cedar Rapids, the Rampage would lose 11-6 to the [[St. Louis Ambush]] at the U.S. Cellular Center on October 30th, 2015. \n\nThe first regular season MASL game in Rampage history was November 6th, 2015 at the [[Missouri Comets]]. The game saw first goal in franchise history, scored by forward Elmo Neto. The Rampage would go on to lose in overtime, 8-7. After an 0-7 start to the season (and two overtime losses) the Rampage would get their first win in a 9-7 comeback victory over the Ambush. Cedar Rapids had at one point trailed 7-2 in the third quarter, but used the fastest hat-trick in MASL history by forward Alex Megson to get back in the game. Player/assistant coach Carlos \u201cChile\u201d Farias would score the tying and winning goals. Midway through the season, the Rampage would acquire forward Gordy Gurson who would go on to become arguably the face of the franchise. A much improved side would win four games the second half of the year and finish 5-15. \n\nThe [[2016\u201317 Major Arena Soccer League season]] would be a turn-around season for the club. Kraft would be let go as head coach before the season, and [[Hewerton Moreira]] was promoted to player-coach. Moreira would go on to finish second in the MASL record books for assists in a season with 29, and the Rampage would have their first winning record with a 12-8 mark, highlighted by wins over the Milwaukee Rampage and defending-and-eventual champions, [[Baltimore Blast]]. The [[Chicago Mustangs]] would edge Cedar Rapids for the last playoff spot, and would also beat the Rampage in the a match that would tie the league record for fewest goals in a match (3-1). \n\nWith the Mustangs voluntarily relegating themselves to [[MASL2]], the Central would be cleared of the Rampage\u2019s biggest nemesis for the [[2017-18 Major Arena Soccer League season]]. Hewerton would leave to become the player-coach of St. Louis, and Jonathan Greenfield would be promoted to role of player-coach. The Rampage would start out with three narrow losses before a run of five straight wins to put them in contention for the Central Division title. A tumultuous December would see drama on and off the field. Bad weather, undesirable home dates, and sponsorship problems saw attendance dip. On the field, goalkeeper Brett Petricek was released and would sign with the Comets, and Greenfield would leave to play for the Baltimore Blast. Former [[Chicago Riot]] goalkeeper and Rockford Rampage goalkeeper/assistant Ante Cop was hired as the new head coach. Cop would lose his first match as head coach on December 31st, 2017, 3-2 to the Baltimore Blast and his next three games after that. However, rookie goalkeeper Rainer Hauss and the rest of the team would thrive under Cop, winning five of their last seven matches. In that stretch, they would clinch their first ever playoff berth on February 16th, 2018 with a 6-5 home win over the Baltimore Blast. \n\nWith reports that the team was for sale, and a conflict with the U.S. Cellular Center, the Rampage played their first \u201chome\u201d playoff match at The [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Villa Park, Illinois. The match would go on to be considered one of the greatest in Ron Newman Cup Playoffs history. The Rampage would battle the Milwaukee Wave in a seesaw affair, including a Mario Alvarez hat-trick and a late game-tying goal from Osvaldo Rojas to send the game to overtime where the Rampage would eventually lose. The second leg in Milwaukee was also back and forth, with a double-brace of four goals by Gordy Gurson, but ended in another one-goal Wave win to take the series. Gurson would be named 3rd Team All-MASL and Hauss would be named goalkeeper on the MASL All-Rookie Team. \n\nThe team folded in 2018, and ownership reformed with many of the same players in Florida as the [[Orlando SeaWolves]].\n\n==Year-by-Year==\n{| class =\"wikitable \"\n|-\n!Season\n!League\n!Record\n!Pct.\n!GF\n!GA\n!Finish\n!Playoffs\n!Avg.

(sports)|franchise]] based in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]]. Founded in June 2015, the team made its debut in the [[Major Arena Soccer League]] with the [[2015\u201316 Major Arena Soccer League season|2015\u201316 season]].<ref name=\"crgz150611\"/><ref name=\"kgan150611\"/> The team's name and logo were revealed at a press conference on July 16, 2015.<ref name=\"crgz150716\"/><ref name=\"kwwl150716\"/>\n\nThe team shared its ownership group with the [[Cedar Rapids Titans]] of the [[Indoor Football League]],<ref name=\"crgz150611\"/><ref name=\"kwwl150716\"/> and sponsored an outdoor team the [[Cedar Rapids Rampage United]] that were a part of the [[Premier League of America]].<ref>http://cedarrapidsrampage.com/archives/838#more-838</ref>\n\nFormer [[Chicago Storm]] assistant and [[Rockford Rampage]] head coach Jeff Kraft was named the first head coach in franchise history. In the first home pre-season match in Cedar Rapids, the Rampage would lose 11-6 to the [[St. Louis Ambush]] at the U.S. Cellular Center on October 30th, 2015. \n\nThe first regular season MASL game in Rampage history was November 6th, 2015 at the [[Missouri Comets]]. The game saw first goal in franchise history, scored by forward Elmo Neto. The Rampage would go on to lose in overtime, 8-7. After an 0-7 start to the season (and two overtime losses) the Rampage would get their first win in a 9-7 comeback victory over the Ambush. Cedar Rapids had at one point trailed 7-2 in the third quarter, but used the fastest hat-trick in MASL history by forward Alex Megson to get back in the game. Player/assistant coach Carlos \u201cChile\u201d Farias would score the tying and winning goals. Midway through the season, the Rampage would acquire forward Gordy Gurson who would go on to become arguably the face of the franchise. A much improved side would win four games the second half of the year and finish 5-15. \n\nThe [[2016\u201317 Major Arena Soccer League season]] would be a turn-around season for the club. Kraft would be let go as head coach before the season, and [[Hewerton Moreira]] was promoted to player-coach. Moreira would go on to finish second in the MASL record books for assists in a season with 29, and the Rampage would have their first winning record with a 12-8 mark, highlighted by wins over the Milwaukee Rampage and defending-and-eventual champions, [[Baltimore Blast]]. The [[Chicago Mustangs]] would edge Cedar Rapids for the last playoff spot, and would also beat the Rampage in the a match that would tie the league record for fewest goals in a match (3-1). \n\nWith the Mustangs voluntarily relegating themselves to [[MASL2]], the Central would be cleared of the Rampage\u2019s biggest nemesis for the [[2017-18 Major Arena Soccer League season]]. Hewerton would leave to become the player-coach of St. Louis, and Jonathan Greenfield would be promoted to role of player-coach. The Rampage would start out with three narrow losses before a run of five straight wins to put them in contention for the Central Division title. A tumultuous December would see drama on and off the field. Bad weather, undesirable home dates, and sponsorship problems saw attendance dip. On the field, goalkeeper Brett Petricek was released and would sign with the Comets, and Greenfield would leave to play for the Baltimore Blast. Former [[Chicago Riot]] goalkeeper and Rockford Rampage goalkeeper/assistant Ante Cop was hired as the new head coach. Cop would lose his first match as head coach on December 31st, 2017, 3-2 to the Baltimore Blast and his next three games after that. However, rookie goalkeeper Rainer Hauss and the rest of the team would thrive under Cop, winning five of their last seven matches. In that stretch, they would clinch their first ever playoff berth on February 16th, 2018 with a 6-5 home win over the Baltimore Blast. \n\nWith reports that the team was for sale, and a conflict with the U.S. Cellular Center, the Rampage played their first \u201chome\u201d playoff match at The [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Villa Park, Illinois. The match would go on to be considered one of the greatest in Ron Newman Cup Playoffs history. The Rampage would battle the Milwaukee Wave in a seesaw affair, including a Mario Alvarez hat-trick and a late game-tying goal from Osvaldo Rojas to send the game to overtime where the Rampage would eventually lose. The second leg in Milwaukee was also back and forth, with a double-brace of four goals by Gordy Gurson, but ended in another one-goal Wave win to take the series. Gurson would be named 3rd Team All-MASL and Hauss would be named goalkeeper on the MASL All-Rookie Team. \n\nThe team folded in 2018, and ownership reformed with many of the same players in Florida as the [[Orlando SeaWolves]].\n\n==Year-by-Year==\n{| class =\"wikitable \"\n|-\n!Season\n!League\n!Record\n!Pct.\n!GF\n!GA\n!Finish\n!Playoffs\n!Avg.

For other uses, see [[Premonition (disambiguation)]].}}\n{{short description|In parapsychology, seeing of the future}}\n{{Paranormal}}\n'''Precognition''' (from the [[Latin]] ''prae-'', \"before\" and ''cognitio'', \"acquiring knowledge\"), also called '''prescience''', '''future vision''', '''future sight''' is a claimed [[psychic]] ability to see events in the future.\n\nAs with other [[paranormal]] phenomena, there is no accepted scientific evidence that precognition is a real effect and it is widely considered to be [[pseudoscience]]. Precognition also appears to violate the principle of [[causality]], that an effect cannot occur before its cause.\n\nPrecognition has been widely believed in throughout history. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many people believe it to be real; it is widely reported and remains a topic of research and discussion within the [[parapsychology]] community.\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\nSince ancient times, precognition has been associated with [[trance]] and [[dream]] states involved in phenomena such as [[prophecy]], [[fortune telling]] and [[second sight]], as well as waking premonitions. These phenomena were widely accepted and reports have persisted throughout history, with most instances appearing in dreams.<ref name=\"inglis\">Inglis (1985), Chapter on \"Precognition\"</ref>\n\nSuch claims of seeing the future have never been without their sceptical critics. [[Aristotle]] carried out an inquiry into allegedly prophetic dreams in his ''[[On Divination in Sleep]]''. He accepted that \"it is quite conceivable that some dreams may be tokens and causes [of future events]\" but also believed that \"most [so-called prophetic] dreams are, however, to be classed as mere [[coincidence]]s...\". Where [[Democritus]] had suggested that emanations from future events could be sent back to the dreamer, Aristotle proposed that it was, rather, the dreamer's sense impressions which reached forward to the event.<ref>Aristotle. (350 BC). On Prophesying by Dreams.  [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/prophesying.html Trans. J.I. Beare], MIT. (Retrieved 5 September 2018).</ref>\n\n===17th\u201319th centuries===\nThe term \"precognition\" first appeared in the 17th century but did not come into common use among investigators until much later.<ref name=\"inglis\"/>\n\nAn early investigation into claims of precognition was published by the missionary Fr. P. Boilat in 1883. He claimed to have put an unspoken question to an African [[witch-doctor]] whom he mistrusted. Contrary to his expectations, the witch-doctor gave him the correct answer without ever having heard the question.<ref name=\"inglis\"/>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn the early 20th century [[J. W. Dunne]], a British aeronautics engineer, experienced several dreams which he regarded as precognitive. He developed techniques to record and analyse them, identifying any correspondences between his future experiences and his recorded dreams. He reported his findings in his 1927 book ''[[An Experiment with Time]]''. In it he alleges that 10% of his dreams appeared to include some element of future experience. He also persuaded some friends to try the experiment on themselves, with mixed results. Dunne concluded that precognitive elements in dreams are common and that many people unknowingly have them.<ref name=\"dunne1927\">Dunne (1927).</ref><ref>[[Antony Flew|Flew, Antony]]; \"The Sources of Serialism'', in Shivesh Thakur (Ed). ''Philosophy and Psychical Research'', George Allen & Unwin Ltd. 1976, pp. 81\u201396. {{ISBN|0-04-100041-2}}</ref> He suggested also that dream precognition did not reference any kind of future event, but specifically the future experiences of the dreamer. He was led to this idea when he found that a dream of a volcanic eruption appeared to foresee not the disaster itself but his subsequent misreading of an inaccurate account in a newspaper.<ref>Sean O'Donnell, ''The Paranormal Explained''. Lulu 2007.</ref><ref name=\"dunne1927\" /> In 1932 he helped the [[Society for Psychical Research]] to conduct a more formal experiment, but he and the Society's lead researcher [[Theodore Besterman]] failed to agree on the significance of the results.<ref>Brian Inglis; ''The Paranormal: An Encyclopedia of Psychic Phenomena''.

Broad; \"The Philosophical Implications of Foreknowledge\", ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes'', Vol. 16, Knowledge and Foreknowledge (1937), pp. 177\u2013209</ref>\n\nIn 1932 [[Charles Lindbergh]]'s infant son was kidnapped, murdered and buried among trees. The psychologists [[Henry Murray]] and D. R. Wheeler tested precognitive dreams by inviting the public to report any dreams of the child. A total of 1,300 dreams were reported. Only five percent envisioned the child dead and only 4 of the 1,300 envisioned the location of the grave as amongst trees. This number was no better than chance.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Murray | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Wheeler | first2 = D.

Rhine used a method of forced-choice matching in which participants guessed the order of a deck of 25 cards, each five of which bore one of five geometrical symbols. Although his results were positive and gained some academic acceptance, his methods were later shown to be badly flawed and subsequent researchers using more rigorous procedures were unable to reproduce his results. His mathematics was sometimes flawed, the experiments were not double-blinded or even necessarily single-blinded and some of the cards to be guessed were so thin that the symbol could be seen through the backing.<ref>[[Harold Gulliksen]].

Soal]] was described by Rhine as one of his harshest critics, running many similar experiments with wholly negative results. However, from around 1940 he ran forced-choice ESP experiments in which a subject attempted to identify which of five animal pictures a subject in another room was looking at. Their performance on this task was at chance, but when the scores were matched with the card that came ''after'' the target card, three of the thirteen subjects showed a very high hit rate.<ref name=\"colman\">{{cite book|last=Colman|first=Andrew M.|title=Facts, Fallacies and Frauds in Psychology|publisher=Unwin Hyman|year=1988|pages=175\u2013180|isbn=978-0-04-445289-8}}</ref> Rhine now described Soal's work as \"a milestone in the field\".<ref name=\"colman\" /> However analyses of Soal's findings, conducted several years later, concluded that the positive results were more likely the result of deliberate fraud.<ref name=\"hyman\" /><ref name=\"hyman\">{{cite book |last=Hyman |first=Ray|authorlink= |editor=Robert J.

In 1969 [[Helmut Schmidt (parapsychologist)|Helmut Schmidt]] introduced the use of high-speed random event generators (REG) for precognition testing, and experiments were also conducted at the [[Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research Lab]].<ref name=Smee>{{cite journal |title=The lab that asked the wrong questions |journal=Nature |date=March 1, 2007 |first=Lucy |last=Odling-Smee |issue=7131 |pages=10\u201311 |doi=10.1038/446010a |url=http://intl.emboj.org/nature/journal/v446/n7131/full/446010a.html |accessdate=2007-06-29 |volume=446 |pmid=17330012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630213439/http://intl.emboj.org/nature/journal/v446/n7131/full/446010a.html |archivedate=June 30, 2007 |bibcode=2007Natur.446...10O |doi-access=free }}</ref> Once again, flaws were found in all of Schmidt's experiments, when the psychologist [[C. E. M. Hansel]] found that several necessary precautions were not taken.<ref>[[C. E. M. Hansel]]. (1980). ''ESP and Parapsychology: A Critical Re-Evaluation''. Prometheus Books. pp. 222\u2013232. Hansel found that in the experiments of Schmidt there was no presence of an observer or second-experimenter in any of the experiments, no counterchecking of the records and no separate machines used for high and low score attempts.</ref>\n\nIn 1963 the [[BBC]] television programme ''Monitor'' broadcast an appeal by the writer [[J.B. Priestley]] for experiences which challenged our understanding of Time. He received hundreds of letters in reply and believed that many of them described genuine precognitive dreams.<ref>Brian Inglis; ''The Paranormal: An Encyclopedia of Psychic Phenomena''.

His survey of over 433 participants showed that 290 or 66.9 percent reported some form of paranormal dream.

Retrofitting provides an explanation for the supposed accuracy of [[Nostradamus]]'s vague prediction.

Precognition also appears to violate the principle of [[causality]], that an effect cannot occur before its cause.\n\nPrecognition has been widely believed in throughout history. Despite the lack of scientific evidence, many people believe it to be real; it is widely reported and remains a topic of research and discussion within the [[parapsychology]] community.\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\nSince ancient times, precognition has been associated with [[trance]] and [[dream]] states involved in phenomena such as [[prophecy]], [[fortune telling]] and [[second sight]], as well as waking premonitions. These phenomena were widely accepted and reports have persisted throughout history, with most instances appearing in dreams.<ref name=\"inglis\">Inglis (1985), Chapter on \"Precognition\"</ref>\n\nSuch claims of seeing the future have never been without their sceptical critics. [[Aristotle]] carried out an inquiry into allegedly prophetic dreams in his ''[[On Divination in Sleep]]''. He accepted that \"it is quite conceivable that some dreams may be tokens and causes [of future events]\" but also believed that \"most [so-called prophetic] dreams are, however, to be classed as mere [[coincidence]]s...\". Where [[Democritus]] had suggested that emanations from future events could be sent back to the dreamer, Aristotle proposed that it was, rather, the dreamer's sense impressions which reached forward to the event.<ref>Aristotle. (350 BC). On Prophesying by Dreams.  [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/prophesying.html Trans. J.I. Beare], MIT. (Retrieved 5 September 2018).</ref>\n\n===17th\u201319th centuries===\nThe term \"precognition\" first appeared in the 17th century but did not come into common use among investigators until much later.<ref name=\"inglis\"/>\n\nAn early investigation into claims of precognition was published by the missionary Fr. P. Boilat in 1883. He claimed to have put an unspoken question to an African [[witch-doctor]] whom he mistrusted. Contrary to his expectations, the witch-doctor gave him the correct answer without ever having heard the question.<ref name=\"inglis\"/>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nIn the early 20th century [[J. W. Dunne]], a British aeronautics engineer, experienced several dreams which he regarded as precognitive. He developed techniques to record and analyse them, identifying any correspondences between his future experiences and his recorded dreams. He reported his findings in his 1927 book ''[[An Experiment with Time]]''. In it he alleges that 10% of his dreams appeared to include some element of future experience. He also persuaded some friends to try the experiment on themselves, with mixed results. Dunne concluded that precognitive elements in dreams are common and that many people unknowingly have them.<ref name=\"dunne1927\">Dunne (1927).</ref><ref>[[Antony Flew|Flew, Antony]]; \"The Sources of Serialism'', in Shivesh Thakur (Ed).

He was led to this idea when he found that a dream of a volcanic eruption appeared to foresee not the disaster itself but his subsequent misreading of an inaccurate account in a newspaper.<ref>Sean O'Donnell, ''The Paranormal Explained''. Lulu 2007.</ref><ref name=\"dunne1927\" /> In 1932 he helped the [[Society for Psychical Research]] to conduct a more formal experiment, but he and the Society's lead researcher [[Theodore Besterman]] failed to agree on the significance of the results.<ref>Brian Inglis; ''The Paranormal: An Encyclopedia of Psychic Phenomena''.

The psychologists [[Henry Murray]] and D. R. Wheeler tested precognitive dreams by inviting the public to report any dreams of the child. A total of 1,300 dreams were reported. Only five percent envisioned the child dead and only 4 of the 1,300 envisioned the location of the grave as amongst trees.

Rhine used a method of forced-choice matching in which participants guessed the order of a deck of 25 cards, each five of which bore one of five geometrical symbols. Although his results were positive and gained some academic acceptance, his methods were later shown to be badly flawed and subsequent researchers using more rigorous procedures were unable to reproduce his results. His mathematics was sometimes flawed, the experiments were not double-blinded or even necessarily single-blinded and some of the cards to be guessed were so thin that the symbol could be seen through the backing.<ref>[[Harold Gulliksen]].

However, from around 1940 he ran forced-choice ESP experiments in which a subject attempted to identify which of five animal pictures a subject in another room was looking at.

Retrofitting provides an explanation for the supposed accuracy of [[Nostradamus]]'s vague prediction.  For example, quatrain I:60 states \"A ruler born near Italy...He's less a prince than a butcher.\"  The phrase \"near Italy\" can be construed as covering a very broad range of geography, while no details are provided by Nostradamus regarding the era when this ruler will live.

A relative of Yan, Liang rose rapidly through Shanxi's power structure, founding and leading a number of organizations dedicated to combating both internal and external threats to Yan's rule. At first radically socialist and later radically anti-communist, Liang's life illustrates the rapid and dramatic career changes that were not uncommon in the chaotic age in which he lived. Liang is best known for the way that he died, committing suicide in a spectacular fashion as a final act of defiance against Shanxi's Communist invaders.\n\nLike many Chinese men before 1949, Liang had more than one name. In contemporary Chinese sources he is more commonly known as \"Liang Dunhou\" (\u6881\u6566\u539a).\n\n==Early career==\n[[File:Yan Xishan, Liang Huazhi and Yan Huiqing.jpg|thumb|Before Yan Xishan (right) left Taiyuan by plane in 1949, Liang Huazhi (left) and Yan Huiqing (middle) saw off at the airport]]\nLiang's political career began in 1932, at the age of 26, when he was named a member of the Kuomintang Shanxi Provincial Governing Committee.<ref Name=\"Schemmel\">Schemmel</ref> Liang was Yan Xishan's nephew, and rapidly gained power within Yan's government in the environment created by Yan's radical economic policies (modeled on those of the Soviet Union) in the early 1930s. The opposition that Yan's socialist economic policies aroused among Shanxi's traditional elites made Yan favour the service of young, progressive followers with modern educations. From the start, Liang's influence on his uncle Yan was profound. By the 1930s Liang was the leader of the group of young bureaucrats in Shanxi who admired the industrial accomplishments of the [[Soviet Union]], and who were determined to see a similar degree of economic progress achieved in modern China. Liang's enthusiasm for realizing Soviet accomplishments were so well known that, before the Second Sino-Japanese War, a Japanese writer accused Liang of being a Communist.<ref>Gillin 173</ref> Liang worked as Yan's secret representative to the [[Chinese Communist Party]] in 1936, and he succeeded in negotiating an anti-Japanese \"united front\" agreement between Yan and the Communists in October 1936.<ref>Feng and Goodman 157</ref>\n\n==Second Sino-Japanese War==\nIn September 1936, on the eve of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Yan created the \"Patriotic Sacrifice League\", a semi-independent organization composed primarily of students and recent graduates for the purpose of encouraging the resistance against the Japanese invasion of China that Yan believed was imminent. Liang, who by 1936 was serving as Yan's personal secretary and enjoyed Yan's complete confidence, became one of the main leaders of the Sacrifice League.<ref>Gillin 231-232</ref>  In 1937 the Japanese finally invaded and occupied the northern half of Shanxi, suffering over 50,000 casualties.<ref>Gillin 273-274</ref> After the Japanese invasion Liang served as the Director of the Political Department of the Second War Zone,<ref Name=\"Schemmel\" /> which included Shanxi, [[Suiyuan]], [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], and northern [[Shaanxi]]. In order to help defeat the Japanese Yan enlisted the assistance of the Communists, who entered Shanxi and initially cooperated with Yan in order to defeat the Japanese.<ref>Gillin 263</ref>\n\nIn July 1937, shortly after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], Liang's Sacrifice League led efforts to arrest, and promote awareness about the dangers of, Japanese spies and ''[[hanjian]]''.<ref>Gillin 257</ref>  After the Japanese began to seriously  threaten Yan's capital of Taiyuan, Yan authorized the expansion of the Sacrifice League's \"Dare-to-Die Corps\" to a force of 15,000 men. This branch of the Sacrifice League became known as the \"New Army\", was composed mostly of young students,<ref>Gillin 262</ref> and became known for its fanatical resistance against the Japanese and for the pro-Communist views of its membership.<ref>Gillin 278</ref> During 1937 and 1938 Yan actively replaced his own magistrates with members of the Sacrifice League, who he believed were less selfish, more enthusiastic, and thus better qualified to lead an organized resistance against Japan.<ref>Gillin 274</ref> After withdrawing to southern Shanxi and waging a guerilla war against the Japanese, Yan owed much of his ability to work with and mobilize the local people to the efforts of Liang's Sacrifice League, whose members placed a high priority on their cooperation with the common people.<ref>Gillin 277</ref>\n\nBy 1939 Yan's relationship with the Communists had become very poor. Because the Sacrifice League was suspected of being pro-Communist, Yan actively suppressed it, arresting many of its members and attempting to disarm its Dare-to-Die Corps. Those who escaped fled to join the Communists. Liang remained loyal to Yan; and, by the early 1940s, was known as being fanatically anti-Communist. After the destruction of the Sacrifice League, Liang became the commander of Yan's police force, responsible for investigating and arresting citizens suspected of being Communists in the area that Yan controlled. Liang's rapid intellectual change, from radical support to radical opposition of Communists and communism, illustrates the dramatic shifts of allegiance that often took place within the minds of individual Chinese between 1937 and 1945.<ref>Gillin 278, 282</ref>\n\n==Civil War==\nHostilities continued between the Communists and Yan's forces shortly after the surrender of the Japanese in 1945. These hostilities continued until 1949, when the Communists took control of most of Shanxi, completely surrounding Yan's capital, Taiyuan, and cutting it off from all sources of military and logistical supply.<ref>Gillin 288</ref> In 1949, shortly before his death, Liang was named the Chairman of the Government of Shanxi.<ref Name=\"Schemmel\" />\n\nThe fall of Taiyuan was one of the few examples in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in which Nationalist forces echoed the defeated Ming loyalists who had, in the 17th century, brought entire cities to ruins resisting the invading Manchus.  Many Nationalist officers were reported to have committed suicide when the city fell. Liang Huazhi fought for years against the Communists in Shanxi until he was finally trapped in the massively fortified city of Taiyuan.  For six months Liang led a savage resistance, leading both Yan's remaining forces and those of the warlord's thousands of Japanese mercenaries.  When Communist troops finally broke into the city and began to occupy large sections of it, Liang barricaded himself inside a large, fortified prison complex filled with Communist prisoners.  In a final act of self-sacrifice, Liang set fire to the prison and committed suicide as the entire compound burned to the ground.<ref>Spence 488</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|18em}}\n\n==References==\n* Feng Chongyi and Goodman, David S.

A relative of Yan, Liang rose rapidly through Shanxi's power structure, founding and leading a number of organizations dedicated to combating both internal and external threats to Yan's rule. At first radically socialist and later radically anti-communist, Liang's life illustrates the rapid and dramatic career changes that were not uncommon in the chaotic age in which he lived. Liang is best known for the way that he died, committing suicide in a spectacular fashion as a final act of defiance against Shanxi's Communist invaders.\n\nLike many Chinese men before 1949, Liang had more than one name. In contemporary Chinese sources he is more commonly known as \"Liang Dunhou\" (\u6881\u6566\u539a).\n\n==Early career==\nLiang's political career began in 1932, at the age of 26, when he was named a member of the Kuomintang Shanxi Provincial Governing Committee.<ref Name=\"Schemmel\">Schemmel</ref> Liang was Yan Xishan's nephew, and rapidly gained power within Yan's government in the environment created by Yan's radical economic policies (modeled on those of the Soviet Union) in the early 1930s. The opposition that Yan's socialist economic policies aroused among Shanxi's traditional elites made Yan favour the service of young, progressive followers with modern educations. From the start, Liang's influence on his uncle Yan was profound. By the 1930s Liang was the leader of the group of young bureaucrats in Shanxi who admired the industrial accomplishments of the [[Soviet Union]], and who were determined to see a similar degree of economic progress achieved in modern China. Liang's enthusiasm for realizing Soviet accomplishments were so well known that, before the Second Sino-Japanese War, a Japanese writer accused Liang of being a Communist.<ref>Gillin 173</ref> Liang worked as Yan's secret representative to the [[Chinese Communist Party]] in 1936, and he succeeded in negotiating an anti-Japanese \"united front\" agreement between Yan and the Communists in October 1936.<ref>Feng and Goodman 157</ref>\n\n==Second Sino-Japanese War==\nIn September 1936, on the eve of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], Yan created the \"Patriotic Sacrifice League\", a semi-independent organization composed primarily of students and recent graduates for the purpose of encouraging the resistance against the Japanese invasion of China that Yan believed was imminent. Liang, who by 1936 was serving as Yan's personal secretary and enjoyed Yan's complete confidence, became one of the main leaders of the Sacrifice League.<ref>Gillin 231-232</ref>  In 1937 the Japanese finally invaded and occupied the northern half of Shanxi, suffering over 50,000 casualties.<ref>Gillin 273-274</ref> After the Japanese invasion Liang served as the Director of the Political Department of the Second War Zone,<ref Name=\"Schemmel\" /> which included Shanxi, [[Suiyuan]], [[Chahar Province|Chahar]], and northern [[Shaanxi]]. In order to help defeat the Japanese Yan enlisted the assistance of the Communists, who entered Shanxi and initially cooperated with Yan in order to defeat the Japanese.<ref>Gillin 263</ref>\n\nIn July 1937, shortly after the [[Marco Polo Bridge Incident]], Liang's Sacrifice League led efforts to arrest, and promote awareness about the dangers of, Japanese spies and ''[[hanjian]]''.<ref>Gillin 257</ref>  After the Japanese began to seriously  threaten Yan's capital of Taiyuan, Yan authorized the expansion of the Sacrifice League's \"Dare-to-Die Corps\" to a force of 15,000 men. This branch of the Sacrifice League became known as the \"New Army\", was composed mostly of young students,<ref>Gillin 262</ref> and became known for its fanatical resistance against the Japanese and for the pro-Communist views of its membership.<ref>Gillin 278</ref> During 1937 and 1938 Yan actively replaced his own magistrates with members of the Sacrifice League, who he believed were less selfish, more enthusiastic, and thus better qualified to lead an organized resistance against Japan.<ref>Gillin 274</ref> After withdrawing to southern Shanxi and waging a guerilla war against the Japanese, Yan owed much of his ability to work with and mobilize the local people to the efforts of Liang's Sacrifice League, whose members placed a high priority on their cooperation with the common people.<ref>Gillin 277</ref>\n\nBy 1939 Yan's relationship with the Communists had become very poor. Because the Sacrifice League was suspected of being pro-Communist, Yan actively suppressed it, arresting many of its members and attempting to disarm its Dare-to-Die Corps. Those who escaped fled to join the Communists. Liang remained loyal to Yan; and, by the early 1940s, was known as being fanatically anti-Communist. After the destruction of the Sacrifice League, Liang became the commander of Yan's police force, responsible for investigating and arresting citizens suspected of being Communists in the area that Yan controlled. Liang's rapid intellectual change, from radical support to radical opposition of Communists and communism, illustrates the dramatic shifts of allegiance that often took place within the minds of individual Chinese between 1937 and 1945.<ref>Gillin 278, 282</ref>\n\n==Civil War==\nHostilities continued between the Communists and Yan's forces shortly after the surrender of the Japanese in 1945. These hostilities continued until 1949, when the Communists took control of most of Shanxi, completely surrounding Yan's capital, Taiyuan, and cutting it off from all sources of military and logistical supply.<ref>Gillin 288</ref> In 1949, shortly before his death, Liang was named the Chairman of the Government of Shanxi.<ref Name=\"Schemmel\" />\n\nThe fall of Taiyuan was one of the few examples in the [[Chinese Civil War]] in which Nationalist forces echoed the defeated Ming loyalists who had, in the 17th century, brought entire cities to ruins resisting the invading Manchus.  Many Nationalist officers were reported to have committed suicide when the city fell. Liang Huazhi fought for years against the Communists in Shanxi until he was finally trapped in the massively fortified city of Taiyuan.  For six months Liang led a savage resistance, leading both Yan's remaining forces and those of the warlord's thousands of Japanese mercenaries.  When Communist troops finally broke into the city and began to occupy large sections of it, Liang barricaded himself inside a large, fortified prison complex filled with Communist prisoners.  In a final act of self-sacrifice, Liang set fire to the prison and committed suicide as the entire compound burned to the ground.<ref>Spence 488</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|18em}}\n\n==References==\n* Feng Chongyi and Goodman, David S.

The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the greater Massanutten range, is composed primarily of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain with a smaller highland valley in between, called Little Fort Valley. The far southern end of Fort Valley also contains a small highland sub-valley called Crisman's Hollow, between Catback and Kerns mountains. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains, knobs, notches and mountain gaps within the ridges of Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain in the southernmost valley and flowing north, fed by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above [https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/shenandoah-river Shenandoah State Park] on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==Special Biological Areas==\n\nThe ridges of Fort Valley administered by the U.S. Forest Service contain several Special Biological Areas (SBA). These include Mudhole Gap SBA in the northern end of the Little Fort Valley; Peters Mill Run Bog SBA in the upper reaches of the Little Fort Valley area just south of Woodstock Tower; Signal Knob SBA and the Edinburg Gap Shale Barrens SBA, two of the easternmost Appalachian shale barrens <ref>https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/Documents/HabitatGuides/13.pdf</ref>; and Scothorn Gap SBA, a 34 acre forest plan-designated Special Biological Area in the southernmost edge of Masanutten Mountain. Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.<ref>http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nFort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \"Indian Basket,\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html</ref>  While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for [[Lord Fairfax]] in 1748<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>.\n\nA first settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. Likely because it was not easily accessible in the colonial era, the area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \"The Fort.\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is said to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, three frontier hunters settled in \"The Fort\" and others soon followed.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had  been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \"The Fort.\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. \n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (later West Virginia.) The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output to be competitive with new mines in the midwest, and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as an important Confederate military observation post. In skirmishing over control of Signal Knob, several Confederate soldiers were killed. One still lies buried there and his grave that inspired the poem, \"The Georgia Volunteer.\"<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> From Signal Knob the view of the Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook is unobstructed. Signal Knob is accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace. Otherwise, during the Civil War no battle was fought in the isolated and contained Fort Valley, but [[General Imboden]]'s cavalry camped there at times.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Landforms of Shenandoah County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ShenandoahCountyVA-geo-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Refimprove|date=February 2014}}\n{{Infobox valley\n| name = Fort Valley\n| photo = Fort_Valley_air.jpg\n| photo_caption = Air photo of Fort Valley, facing south, with the North (right) and South (left) Forks of the [[Shenandoah River]] visible.

Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.<ref>http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nFort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \"Indian Basket,\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html</ref>  While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for [[Lord Fairfax]] in 1748<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>.\n\nA first settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. Likely because it was not easily accessible in the colonial era, the area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \"The Fort.\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is said to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, three frontier hunters settled in \"The Fort\" and others soon followed.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had  been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \"The Fort.\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. \n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (later West Virginia.) The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output to be competitive with new mines in the midwest, and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping panoramic views of of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as an important Confederate military observation post. In skirmishing over control of Signal Knob, several Confederate soldiers were killed. One still lies buried there and his grave that inspired the poem, \"The Georgia Volunteer.\"<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> From Signal Knob the view of the Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook is unobstructed. Signal Knob is accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace. Otherwise, during the Civil War no battle was fought in the isolated and containeed Fort Valley, but [[General Imboden]]'s cavalry camped there at times.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:Landforms of Shenandoah County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Valleys of Virginia]]\n\n\n{{ShenandoahCountyVA-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Woodrusher", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Valley_(Virginia)"}

The origins of the term are found in [[Ancient Greece]]. In the [[Athenian democracy]], the [[public opinion]] of voters was influenced by the [[political satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theaters]].<ref>Henderson, J. (1993) ''Comic Hero versus Political Elite'' pp. 307\u201319 in {{cite book |editor1=Sommerstein, A.H. |editor2=S. Halliwell |editor3=J. Henderson |editor4=B. Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}</ref> The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. [[Northrop Frye]] depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old.\"<ref>([[Anatomy of Criticism]], 1957)</ref> A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic [[irony]] which provokes [[laughter]].<ref>Marteinson, 2006</ref>\n\n[[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. [[Parody]] subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.\n\nOther forms of comedy include [[screwball comedy]], which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters, and [[black comedy]], which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature.  Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], sexual humor, and [[ethnic joke|race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comic ways. A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File: Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks of [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek Theatre]]\nrepresented in the  [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]\nThe word \"comedy\" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 ''k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda'', which is a compound of [[komos|\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]] ''k\u00f4mos'' (revel) and \u1fa0\u03b4\u03ae ''\u014did\u1e17'' (singing).<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/comedy ] \"The old derivation from ''kome'' \"village\" is not now regarded.\"</ref> The adjective \"comic\" (Greek \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''k\u014dmik\u00f3s),'' which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of \"laughter-provoking\".<ref name = \"Cornford1934pn\">Cornford (1934){{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref> Of this, the word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia'' and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.<ref name = OED>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] confined their use of the [[word]] \"comedy\" to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings. [[Aristotle]] defined comedy as an imitation of men worse than the average (where [[tragedy]] was an imitation of men better than the average). However, the characters portrayed in comedies were not worse than average in every way, only insofar as they are Ridiculous, which is a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, for instance, that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain.<ref>[[Richard McKeon|McKeon, Richard]]. ''The Basic Works Of Aristotle'', the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2001, p. 1459.</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings.

They disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''[[hija]]'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or to the troubling beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy.\n\nAfter the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term \"comedy\" gained a more general meaning in [[medieval literature]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/470561|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain|first=Edwin J.|jstor=470561|last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|pages=1\u201311}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, many scholars preferred to use the term ''[[laughter]]'' to refer to the whole [[gamut]] of the comic, in order to avoid the use of ambiguous and problematically defined genres such as the [[grotesque]], [[irony]], and [[satire]].<ref>Herman Braet, Guido Latr\u00e9, Werner Verbeke (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6mqDEpy0YUsC&pg=PA1 ''Risus mediaevalis: laughter in medieval literature and art''] p.1 quotation: {{quotation|The deliberate use by Menard of the term 'le rire' rather than 'l'humour' reflects accurately the current evidency to incorporate all instances of the comic in the analysis, while the classification in genres and fields such as grotesque, humour and even irony or satire always poses problems.

For Aristotle, a comedy did not need to involve sexual humor.  A comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character. Aristotle divides comedy into three categories or subgenres:  [[farce]], [[romantic comedy]], and [[satire]].  On the contrary, [[Plato]] taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter, \"for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\" Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.\n\nAlso in ''Poetics'', Aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of [[literature]]. The other three genres are [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry]], and [[lyric poetry]]. Literature, in general, is defined by Aristotle as a [[mimesis]], or imitation of life. Comedy is the third form of literature, being the most divorced from a true mimesis. Tragedy is the truest mimesis, followed by epic poetry, comedy, and lyric poetry. The genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to Aristotle's definition. Comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or reveals the insignificance of the aims.\n\n====Early Renaissance forms of comedy====\n{{main|Divine Comedy|Dante}}\nThe ''Divine Comedy'' ({{lang-it|Divina Commedia}} {{IPA-it|di\u02c8vi\u02d0na kom\u02c8m\u025b\u02d0dja|}}) is a long [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]], begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321.

Under such premises, people can identify precursors and early examples of surreal humour at least since the 19th century, such as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', which both use illogic and absurdity ([[hookah]]-smoking [[caterpillars]], [[croquet]] matches using live [[flamingos]] as mallets, etc.) for humorous effect. Many of [[Edward Lear]]'s children stories and poems contain [[literary nonsense|nonsense]] and are basically surreal in approach. For example, ''The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Round the World'' (1871) is filled with contradictory statements and odd images intended to provoke amusement, such as the following:\n{{quote|After a time they saw some land at a distance; and when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth.

[[Charlie Chaplin]], through silent film, became one of the best-known faces on Earth. The silent tradition lived on well into the 20th century through mime artists like [[Marcel Marceau]], and the physical comedy of artists like [[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean]]. The tradition of the circus clown also continued, with such as [[Bozo the Clown]] in the United States and [[Oleg Popov]] in Russia. Radio provided new possibilities \u2014 with Britain producing the influential [[surreal humour]] of the [[Goon Show]] after the Second World War. The Goons' influence spread to the American radio and [[audio recording|recording]] troupe [[the Firesign Theatre]].

[[Hollywood]] attracted many international talents like the British comics [[Peter Sellers]], [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], Canadian comics [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Mike Myers]], and the [[Australian comedy|Australian comedian]]  [[Paul Hogan]], famous for ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''. Other centres of creative comic activity have been the [[cinema of Hong Kong]], [[Bollywood]], and French [[farce]].\n\nAmerican television has also been an influential force in world comedy: with American series like ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' achieving large followings around the world. British television comedy also remains influential, with quintessential works including ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', [[Monty Python]], ''[[Dad's Army]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'', and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''.

The origins of the term are found in [[Ancient Greece]]. In the [[Athenian democracy]], the [[public opinion]] of voters was influenced by the [[political satire]] performed by the [[comic poets]] at the [[Ancient Greek theatre|theaters]].<ref>Henderson, J.

Zimmerman |title=Tragedy, Comedy and the Polis |year=1993 |publisher=Levante Editori |location=Bari}}</ref> The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing [[agon]] or conflict. [[Northrop Frye]] depicted these two opposing sides as a \"Society of Youth\" and a \"Society of the Old.\"<ref>([[Anatomy of Criticism]], 1957)</ref> A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic [[irony]] which provokes [[laughter]].<ref>Marteinson, 2006</ref>\n\n[[Satire]] and [[political satire]] use comedy to portray persons or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus alienating their audience from the object of their humor. [[Parody]] subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing those forms without necessarily condemning them.\n\nOther forms of comedy include [[screwball comedy]], which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and improbable) situations or characters, and [[black comedy]], which is characterized by a form of humor that includes darker aspects of human behavior or human nature.  Similarly [[Toilet humor|scatological humor]], sexual humor, and [[ethnic joke|race humor]] create comedy by violating [[Convention (norm)|social conventions]] or [[taboo]]s in comic ways. A [[comedy of manners]] typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. [[Romantic comedy]] is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File: Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks of [[Theatre of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek Theatre]]\nrepresented in the  [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]\nThe word \"comedy\" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u1ff3\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 ''k\u014dm\u014did\u00eda'', which is a compound of [[komos|\u03ba\u1ff6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2]] ''k\u00f4mos'' (revel) and \u1fa0\u03b4\u03ae ''\u014did\u1e17'' (singing).<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/comedy ] \"The old derivation from ''kome'' \"village\" is not now regarded.\"</ref> The adjective \"comic\" (Greek \u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ''k\u014dmik\u00f3s),'' which strictly means that which relates to comedy is, in modern usage, generally confined to the sense of \"laughter-provoking\".<ref name = \"Cornford1934pn\">Cornford (1934){{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref> Of this, the word came into modern usage through the Latin ''comoedia'' and Italian ''commedia'' and has, over time, passed through various shades of meaning.<ref name = OED>Oxford English Dictionary</ref>\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] confined their use of the [[word]] \"comedy\" to descriptions of stage-plays with happy endings. [[Aristotle]] defined comedy as an imitation of men worse than the average (where [[tragedy]] was an imitation of men better than the average). However, the characters portrayed in comedies were not worse than average in every way, only insofar as they are Ridiculous, which is a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistake or deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, for instance, that excites laughter is something ugly and distorted without causing pain.<ref>[[Richard McKeon|McKeon, Richard]]. ''The Basic Works Of Aristotle'', the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2001, p. 1459.</ref> In the [[Middle Ages]], the term expanded to include narrative poems with happy endings.  It is in this sense that [[Dante]] used the term in the title of his poem, ''[[The Divine Comedy|La Commedia]]''.\n\nAs time progressed, the word came more and more to be associated with any sort of performance intended to cause laughter.<ref name = OED/> During the Middle Ages, the term \"comedy\" became synonymous with [[satire]], and later with [[humour]] in general.\n\nAristotle's [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], where it was elaborated upon by [[Arabic literature|Arabic writers]] and [[Early Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosophers]], such as Abu Bischr, and his pupils [[Al-Farabi]], [[Avicenna]], and [[Averroes]]. They disassociated comedy from [[Greek drama]]tic representation and instead identified it with [[Arabic poetry|Arabic poetic]] themes and forms, such as ''[[hija]]'' (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the \"art of reprehension\", and made no reference to light and cheerful events, or to the troubling beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy.\n\nAfter the [[Latin translations of the 12th century]], the term \"comedy\" gained a more general meaning in [[medieval literature]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/470561|title=Comedy as Satire in Hispano-Arabic Spain|first=Edwin J.|jstor=470561|last=Webber|journal=Hispanic Review|volume=26|issue=1|date=January 1958|pages=1\u201311}}</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, many scholars preferred to use the term ''[[laughter]]'' to refer to the whole [[gamut]] of the comic, in order to avoid the use of ambiguous and problematically defined genres such as the [[grotesque]], [[irony]], and [[satire]].<ref>Herman Braet, Guido Latr\u00e9, Werner Verbeke (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=6mqDEpy0YUsC&pg=PA1 ''Risus mediaevalis: laughter in medieval literature and art''] p.1 quotation: {{quotation|The deliberate use by Menard of the term 'le rire' rather than 'l'humour' reflects accurately the current evidency to incorporate all instances of the comic in the analysis, while the classification in genres and fields such as grotesque, humour and even irony or satire always poses problems.

For Aristotle, a comedy did not need to involve sexual humor.  A comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character. Aristotle divides comedy into three categories or subgenres:  [[farce]], [[romantic comedy]], and [[satire]].  On the contrary, [[Plato]] taught that comedy is a destruction to the self. He believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and learning. In ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter, \"for ordinarily when one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction.\" Plato says comedy should be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.\n\nAlso in ''Poetics'', Aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of [[literature]]. The other three genres are [[tragedy]], [[epic poetry]], and [[lyric poetry]]. Literature, in general, is defined by Aristotle as a [[mimesis]], or imitation of life. Comedy is the third form of literature, being the most divorced from a true mimesis. Tragedy is the truest mimesis, followed by epic poetry, comedy, and lyric poetry. The genre of comedy is defined by a certain pattern according to Aristotle's definition. Comedies begin with low or base characters seeking insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or reveals the insignificance of the aims.\n\n====Early Renaissance forms of comedy====\n{{main|Divine Comedy|Dante}}\nThe ''Divine Comedy'' ({{lang-it|Divina Commedia}} {{IPA-it|di\u02c8vi\u02d0na kom\u02c8m\u025b\u02d0dja|}}) is a long [[Narrative poetry|narrative poem]] by [[Dante Alighieri]], begun c. 1308 and completed in 1320, a year before his death in 1321.

Constructions of surreal humour tend to involve bizarre juxtapositions, incongruity, [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequiturs]], irrational or absurd situations and expressions of [[nonsense]].<ref name=stockwell>{{cite book|last1=Stockwell|first1=Peter|title=The Language of Surrealism|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/?id=KZhNDQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA177&dq=Surreal%20humour&pg=PA177#v=onepage&q=Surreal%20humour&f=false|isbn=978-1-137-39219-0|date=2016-11-01}}</ref> The humour arises from a subversion of audience's expectations, so that amusement is founded on [[predictability|unpredictability]], separate from a logical analysis of the situation. The humour derived gets its appeal from the ridiculousness and unlikeliness of the situation. The genre has roots in [[Surrealism]] in the arts.<ref name=stockwell/>\n\n[[File:Edward Lear and His Cat Foss 1885.jpg|thumb|''Edward Lear, Aged 73 and a Half and His Cat Foss, Aged 16'', an 1885 lithograph by [[Edward Lear]]]]\nSurreal humour is the effect of [[logic|illogic]] and [[absurdity]] being used for humorous effect. Under such premises, people can identify precursors and early examples of surreal humour at least since the 19th century, such as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'', which both use illogic and absurdity ([[hookah]]-smoking [[caterpillars]], [[croquet]] matches using live [[flamingos]] as mallets, etc.) for humorous effect. Many of [[Edward Lear]]'s children stories and poems contain [[literary nonsense|nonsense]] and are basically surreal in approach. For example, ''The Story of the Four Little Children Who Went Round the World'' (1871) is filled with contradictory statements and odd images intended to provoke amusement, such as the following:\n{{quote|After a time they saw some land at a distance; and when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. Besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses with a great Gulf-stream running about all over it, so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lear|first=Edward|title=Nonsense Songs, Stories, Botany, and Alphabets|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/13650/13650-h/13650-h.htm#children|date=2004-10-08}}</ref>}}\n\nIn the early 20th century, several [[avant-garde]] movements, including the [[Dadaism|dadaists]], [[Surrealism|surrealists]], and [[Futurism (art)|futurists]], began to argue for an art that was random, jarring and illogical.<ref>{{cite book|title=The History of Futurism: The Precursors, Protagonists, and Legacies|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2012|editor1-last=Buelens|editor1-first=Geert|editor2-last=Hendrix|editor2-first=Harald|editor3-last=Jansen|editor3-first=Monica|isbn=978-0-7391-7387-9}}</ref> The goals of these movements were in some sense serious, and they were committed to undermining the solemnity and self-satisfaction of the contemporary artistic [[wikt:establishment|establishment]]. As a result, much of their art was intentionally amusing.\n\nA famous example is [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' (1917), an inverted urinal signed \"R. Mutt\". This became one of the most famous and influential pieces of art in history, and one of the earliest examples of the [[found object]] movement. It is also a joke, relying on the inversion of the item's function as expressed by its title as well as its incongruous presence in an art exhibition.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/3671180/Duchamps-Fountain-The-practical-joke-that-launched-an-artistic-revolution.html|first=Martin|last=Gayford|title=Duchamp's Fountain: The practical joke that launched an artistic revolution|date=16 February 2008|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=5 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== 20th century film, records, radio, and television ====\n[[File:Lewis and Martin.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] (ca. 1950)]]\n[[File:Jim-Carrey-2008.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Jim Carrey]] mugs for the camera]]\n[[File: Rowan Atkinson and Manneken Pis.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean]]]]\n[[File:Jackie Chan Cannes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jackie Chan]] at the [[2008 Cannes Film Festival]]]]\n[[File:MargaretChoSanFrancisco.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stand-up comedy|Stand-up comedian]] [[Margaret Cho]]]]\n[[File:Oleg popov2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Oleg Popov|Popov the Clown]] in 2009]]\n[[File: Dame Edna at the royal wedding cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Barry Humphries]] in character in London as \"[[Dame Edna Everage]]\" on the day of 2011 [[Wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton]]]]\n[[File:Jordan Peele Peabody 2014 (cropped).jpg|upright|thumb|[[Jordan Peele]] at the Peabody awards.]]\nThe advent of cinema in the late 19th century, and later radio and television in the 20th century broadened the access of comedians to the general public. [[Charlie Chaplin]], through silent film, became one of the best-known faces on Earth. The silent tradition lived on well into the 20th century through mime artists like [[Marcel Marceau]], and the physical comedy of artists like [[Rowan Atkinson]] as [[Mr. Bean]]. The tradition of the circus clown also continued, with such as [[Bozo the Clown]] in the United States and [[Oleg Popov]] in Russia. Radio provided new possibilities \u2014 with Britain producing the influential [[surreal humour]] of the [[Goon Show]] after the Second World War. The Goons' influence spread to the American radio and [[audio recording|recording]] troupe [[the Firesign Theatre]]. [[American cinema]] has produced a great number of globally renowned comedy artists, from [[Laurel and Hardy]], the [[Three Stooges]], [[Abbott and Costello]], [[Martin and Lewis|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis]], as well as [[Bob Hope]] during the mid-20th century, to performers like [[George Carlin]], [[Robin Williams]], and [[Eddie Murphy]] at the end of the century. [[Hollywood]] attracted many international talents like the British comics [[Peter Sellers]], [[Dudley Moore]] and [[Sacha Baron Cohen]], Canadian comics [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Jim Carrey]], and [[Mike Myers]], and the [[Australian comedy|Australian comedian]]  [[Paul Hogan]], famous for ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''. Other centres of creative comic activity have been the [[cinema of Hong Kong]], [[Bollywood]], and French [[farce]].\n\nAmerican television has also been an influential force in world comedy: with American series like ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' achieving large followings around the world. British television comedy also remains influential, with quintessential works including ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', [[Monty Python]], ''[[Dad's Army]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'', and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Australian satirist [[Barry Humphries]], whose comic creations include the housewife and \"gigastar\" Dame [[Edna Everage]], for his delivery of Dadaist and [[Absurdism|absurdist]] humour to millions, was described by biographer Anne Pender in 2010 as not only \"the most significant theatrical figure of our time ... [but] the most significant comedian to emerge since [[Charlie Chaplin]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/books/absurd-moments-in-the-frocks-of-the-dame-20100914-15ar3.html |title=Absurd moments: in the frocks of the dame |first=Steve |last=Meacham |publisher=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref>\n\n===Non-Western history of comedy===\n\n==== Classical Sanskrit Dramas, Plays, and Epics of Ancient India ====\n{{See also|Sanskrit Drama|Mahabharata|Bhagavata Purana}}\nBy 200 BC,<ref>{{cite book|title=Theatre in Your Life|page=218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeUbCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA218&dq=|author=Robert Barton, Annie McGregor|publisher=CengageBrain|isbn=978-1-285-46348-3|date=2014-01-03}}</ref> in ancient [[Sanskrit drama]], [[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' defined humour (''h\u0101syam'') as one of the nine ''[[nava rasas]]'', or principle ''[[Rasa (aesthetics)|rasas]]'' (emotional responses), which can be inspired in the audience by ''bhavas'', the imitations of emotions that the actors perform. Each ''rasa'' was associated with a specific ''bhavas'' portrayed on stage. In the case of humour, it was associated with mirth (''hasya'').\n\n== Studies on comic theory ==\nThe phenomena connected with [[laughter]] and that which provokes it have been carefully investigated by psychologists. They agree the predominant characteristics are incongruity or contrast in the object and shock or emotional seizure on the part of the subject. It has also been held that the feeling of superiority is an essential factor: thus [[Thomas Hobbes]] speaks of laughter as a \"sudden glory\". Modern investigators have paid much attention to the origin both of laughter and of smiling, as well as the development of the \"play instinct\" and its emotional expression.\n\n[[George Meredith]] said that \"One excellent test of the civilization of a country ... I take to be the flourishing of the Comic idea and Comedy, and the test of true Comedy is that it shall awaken thoughtful laughter.\" Laughter is said to be the cure for being sick. Studies show that people who laugh more often get sick less.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ep.tc/realist/15/03.html |title=An impolite interview with Lenny Bruce |journal=The Realist |issue=15 |date=February 1960 |page=3 |accessdate=2011-12-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://emotional-literacy-education.com/classic-books-online-b/esycm10.htm |title=Essay on Comedy, Comic Spirit |first=George |last=Meredith|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Self, by Mark Zimmerman |year=1987 |accessdate=2011-12-30 }}</ref>\n\nAmerican literary theorist [[Kenneth Burke]] writes that the \"comic frame\" in rhetoric is \"neither wholly euphemistic, nor wholly debunking\u2014hence it provides the charitable attitude towards people that is required for purposes of persuasion and co-operation, but at the same time maintains our shrewdness concerning the simplicities of \u2018cashing in.\u2019\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://newantichoicerhetoric.web.unc.edu/the-comedic-frame/|title=The Comic Frame|author=|date=|website=newantichoicerhetoric.web.unc.edu}}</ref> The purpose of the comic frame is to satirize a given circumstance and promote change by doing so.

In a segment on [[President Obama]]'s trip to China Stewart remarks on America's debt to the Chinese government while also having a weak relationship with the country. After depicting this dismal situation, Stewart shifts to speak directly to President Obama, calling upon him to \"shine that turd up.\"<ref>Trischa Goodnow Knapp (2011).

Lexington Books, 2011</ref> For Stewart and his audience, introducing coarse language into what is otherwise a serious commentary on the state of foreign relations serves to frame the segment comically, creating a serious tone underlying the comedic agenda presented by Stewart.\n\n== Forms ==\n{{Main|Comedic genres}}\n\nComedy may be divided into multiple [[genre]]s based on the source of humor, the method of delivery, and the context in which it is delivered.  The different forms of comedy often overlap, and most comedy can fit into multiple genres. Some of the subgenres of comedy are [[farce]], [[comedy of manners]], [[burlesque]], and [[satire]].\n\nSome comedy apes certain cultural forms: for instance, parody and [[satire]] often imitate the conventions of the genre they are parodying or satirizing. For example, in the United States, parodies of newspapers and television news include ''[[The Onion]]'', and ''[[The Colbert Report]]''; in Australia, shows such as ''[[Kath & Kim]],'' [[Utopia (Australian TV series)|''Utopia'']], and ''[[Shaun Micallef's Mad as Hell|Shaun Micallef's Mad As Hell]]'' perform the same role.\n\n[[Self-deprecation]] is a technique of comedy used by many
