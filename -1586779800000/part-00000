Scientists unearthing the site have discovered [[ceramic]] pots, bronze bowls, glass bottles, and homes and villagers buried by ash in a manner similar to that of [[Pompeii]]. The [[Tambora language|language of the culture]] was wiped out. The language appears to have been an [[language isolate|isolate]], the last survivor of the pre-[[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] languages of central Indonesia. The village was visited by western explorers shortly before its demise. It is believed to have traded with Indochina, as Tambora pottery resembles that found in Vietnam.\n\n==2004 work==\nIn summer 2004, a team from the [[University of Rhode Island]], the [[University of North Carolina at Wilmington]], and the Indonesian Directorate of Volcanology, led by [[Haraldur Sigurdsson]], began an [[Excavation (archaeology)|archaeological dig]] in Tambora.<ref name = \"URI\" />  Over six weeks, the team unearthed the first evidence of a lost culture that had been obliterated by the Tambora eruption. The site is located about 25&nbsp;km (15.5&nbsp;mi) west of the caldera, deep in the jungle, 5&nbsp;km (3&nbsp;mi) from the shore. The team had to cut through a deposit of volcanic pumice and ash 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) thick.\n\nThe team used a [[ground-penetrating radar]] to locate a small buried house. They excavated the house, where they found the remains of two adults, as well as bronze bowls, ceramic pots, iron tools and other artifacts. The design and decoration of the artifacts have similarities with artifacts from [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]].<ref name = \"URI\" /> Tests conducted using a carbonization technique revealed they were composed of [[charcoal]] formed by the heat of the [[magma]]. The people and the house are preserved as they were in 1815. Sigurdsson dubbed it the ''[[Pompeii]] of the East''.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=BBC News  |title='Pompeii of the East' discovered|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4748902.stm|date= 28 February 2006|accessdate= 9 October 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|publisher=Bloomberg Asia|title=Indonesian Volcano Site Reveals \u2018Pompeii of the East\u2019 (Update1)|url= https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000080&sid=agqrX3FIpeQU&refer=asia|date=28 February 2006| accessdate=9 October 2006}}</ref> Based on the artifacts found, which were mainly [[bronze]] objects, the team concluded that the people were not poor.
