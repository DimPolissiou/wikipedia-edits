Its original title translates as \"the usual unknown persons\", a journalistic and bureaucratic [[euphemism]] for \"unidentified criminals\". The film is a comedy about a group of small-time thieves and ne'er-do-wells who bungle an attempt to burgle a [[pawn shop]] in [[Rome]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9801E3DA1431EF3ABC4B51DFB767838B679EDE Crowther, Bosley. \"The Screen: Italian Parody of 'Rififi':'Big Deal on Madonna Street' in Premiere Toto Among Bungling Burglars at the Paris\" (''The New York Times'', November 23, 1960)]</ref>\n\nThe five hapless would-be burglars are played by [[Vittorio Gassman]], [[Renato Salvatori]], [[Carlo Pisacane (actor)|Carlo Pisacane]], [[Tiberio Murgia]] and [[Marcello Mastroianni]]. The careers of both Gassman and Mastroianni were considerably helped by the success of the film, Gassman in particular, since before then he was not deemed suitable for comedic roles. [[Claudia Cardinale]] featured in a minor role (a chaste, black-clad [[Sicily|Sicilian]] girl, almost held prisoner at home by her overbearing brother, played by Murgia); she would later rise to fame for other work.  The film is also notable for its breezy jazz score by composer [[Piero Umiliani]], who helped develop the style of the jazz soundtracks now considered characteristic of European films in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe producers were initially skeptical about the film's success, and to boost audience interest highlighted the appearance of the famous comedian [[Tot\u00f2]] in the original poster even though his character chooses to remain a consultant to the heist gang rather than joining it outright.\n\nThe film is distributed in [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] by [[The Criterion Collection]] and for the Italian market in [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] by [[20th Century Fox]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/films/652-big-deal-on-madonna-street|title=Big Deal on Madonna Street|website=The Criterion Collection}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nA hapless small-time Roman crook, Cosimo ([[Memmo Carotenuto]]), is arrested for a bungled car theft and sentenced to a few months in prison. He is desperate to be released so his gang may carry out a heist idea stolen from another inmate, a dishonest bricklayer who purposely constructed a flimsy wall between the dining room of a vacant apartment and a pawn shop safe. Ultimately, Cosimo's gang bribes a boxer named Peppe ([[Vittorio Gassman]]) with a clean criminal record to confess to his crime. The warden does not believe Peppe, however, and he ends up in jail alongside Cosimo. Peppe tells Cosimo that he has been sentenced to three long years for this minor offense and Cosimo, to justify his actions, explains the details of the pawn shop heist. Peppe then gleefully reveals that he has been given a year's probation and walks out the prison gate, infuriating Cosimo. \n\nPeppe takes up the plan with Cosimo's gang: Mario ([[Renato Salvatori]]), a petty thief and the youngest member of the group; Michele ([[Tiberio Murgia]]), a posturing Sicilian crook who needs money for his sheltered sister's dowry; Tiberio ([[Marcello Mastroianni]]), a down and out photographer caring for his baby while his wife is in jail on a minor offense; and Capannelle ([[Carlo Pisacane (actor)|Carlo Pisacane]]), an elderly pickpocket. The group case the pawn shop: to get into the apartment they must cut a lock on a coal chute, slide into the basement, sneak into a small courtyard, climb onto the roof of a first floor apartment, break into the vacant apartment through a window, then punch through the wall between it and the pawn shop. Tiberio steals a movie camera with a telephoto lens from a flea market to film the safe's combination, but without success. Since none involved have the skill to crack the safe, they enlist the help of genteel local safecracker Dante ([[Tot\u00f2]]), who is cautious not to violate his parole but supplies tools and gives them a brief primer.\n\nThe gang discover the vacant apartment is now occupied by two spinsters and their young, attractive maid Nicoletta ([[Carla Gravina]]). Ladies' man Peppe learns from Nicoletta that the two women leave the apartment once a week, from Thursday evening till Friday morning. Peppe earns the offer of a tryst with the maid the next time the ladies leave. The rest of the group pressures him to accept so they can stage the burglary, but she unexpectedly quits her job in a huff and does not know if the spinsters will make their next scheduled departure.\n\nMeanwhile, Cosimo is released from prison. He had insisted on a substantial portion of the loot as the plan's mastermind but was rebuffed. Now, he vows vengeance on the group. He enters the pawn shop with a gun, which the blas\u00e9 pawnbroker assumes he wants to hock. Deflated, Cosimo leaves, but during a botched purse snatching he is killed by a streetcar. Mario has fallen for Michele's sister, Carmelina ([[Claudia Cardinale]]), and quits the caper, vowing to pursue a straight life and court Carmelina. Tiberio leaves his baby with his wife in prison to participate in the robbery, but the flea market proprietor breaks his arm for stealing the camera.\n\nThe group learns that the elderly occupants will make their weekly trip after all. Re-energized, the gang break into the apartment and set about breaking through the dining room wall. After a couple of miscues, they succeed, but the opening leads to the apartment's own kitchen; the elderly women had rearranged the furniture.\n\nRealizing they now have too little time to try again before the pawn shop opens for business, they resignedly raid the refrigerator. Their repast ends abruptly when ever-starved Capannelle blows up the stove while lighting one of its burners.  Thwarted, they all straggle homeward, members peeling off one by one until only Peppe and Capanelle are left. Peppe then surprises Capanelle by deciding to find legitimate work. The film ends with a newspaper article recounting a robbery by unknown persons who apparently broke into an apartment to steal pasta with chickpeas.\n\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n{|class=wikitable\n!Actor!!Role (character names are not indicated in on-screen cast credits)\n|-\n|[[Vittorio Gassman]] ||Peppe il pantera\n|-\n|[[Renato Salvatori]]||Mario Angeletti\n|-\n|[[Memmo Carotenuto]] ||Cosimo\n|-\n|[[Rossana Rory]]||Norma\n|-\n|[[Carla Gravina]]||Nicoletta\n|-\n|[[Claudia Cardinale]]||Carmelina\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|[[Carlo Pisacane (actor)|Carlo Pisacane]]||Capannelle\n|-\n|[[Tiberio Murgia]]||Michele\n|-\n|Gina Rovere||Teresa, Tiberio's wife\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|Gina Amendola||Mario's \"Madre\"\n|-\n|Elvira Tonelli||Assunta\n|-\n|[[Elena Fabrizi]]||Signora Ada\n|-\n|Pasquale Misiano||Massimo\n|-\n|[[Renato Terra]]||Eladio\n|-\n|Aldo Trifiletti||Fernando the night porter\n|-\n|[[Nino Marchetti]]||Luigi\n|-\n|Mario De Simone||Receiver of stolen goods\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|''with'' [[Marcello Mastroianni]]||Tiberio\n|-\n|''and special participation of'' [[Tot\u00f2]]||Dante Cruciani\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{quote farm|section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:I soliti ignoti filming site.jpg|thumb|The building depicted in the film, photographed in 2019]]\nAccording to director Mario Monicelli, while the film was intended as a parody of neorealism, \"by then neorealism was already a thing of the past, something that was surpassed. It was more a parody that was aligned with a certain realism around us, with the poverty, and with people who had to do the best they could with whatever means possible to survive, with petty crimes. ...They are people without education or strong family support who are only attempting to survive. All my films have this type of theme or idea.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\">{{cite journal |last1=Totaro |first1=Donato |title=Interview with Mario Monicelli |journal=Offscreen |date=September 1999 |volume=3 |issue=5 |url=https://offscreen.com/view/mario_monicelli |accessdate=1 January 2019 |language=en |issn=1712-9559}}</ref>\n\nAsked if it was also a parody of [[Jules Dassin]]'s film ''[[Rififi]]'', Monicelli said, \"Yes because we saw this as a film shot in a very harsh, realist style. Very scientific, as the Peppe character continually says. So we wanted to do the same thing, but the characters didn't have the means. The way they worked was quite the contrary actually.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nMonicelli and cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo agreed on a photographic tone that was not comedic or brightly lit. \"On the contrary,\" Monicelli said, \"harsh and dramatic, because the film has a dramatic side in that it is about poor people. We also have the death of Cosimo, and his funeral. So it's a comedy but with death. Which was something new at the time. It was rare to find death and failure in a comedy. I had difficulty making the film because the producers didn\u2019t want me to make it this way. With Vittorio Gassman who wasn\u2019t a comedian, with the film ending in failure, and with the death of a central character. All this made it difficult. But Di Venanzo understood the tone. To make people laugh with a story that was dramatic rather than comic. But seen with a comic eye.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nThe film was shot in ten weeks on locations throughout Rome. \"Even most of the interiors were on location,\" Monicelli said. \"The only interior that was shot in a studio was the wall that gets broken into at the end because I couldn\u2019t break a wall in an actual apartment! But all the other interiors were shot on location. Which of course was a particular trait of Italian cinema, to shoot on location. Especially in those days, although that tendency remains even in contemporary Italian cinema...There were not that many cars and little traffic. Italy was a poor country. People walked or took what little public transport there was, especially in the city peripherals. In the city centers of course it was a little busier, but still not heavy in traffic. Italy was a country not far removed from the war, with much visible destruction. That was the reality.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nAccording to Monicelli, the film adhered to the script, without improvisations. \"I don\u2019t do improvising,\" he said. \"I don't know how. I like to know everything in advance and spend a long time in preparation.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nDialogue, as was customary in Italian cinema, was all post-dubbed. Monicelli explained, \"First of all because in Italy we often shoot with actors who are not professional. For example the guy who plays the Sicilian, the jealous brother Ferribotte, was not an actor. He was a dishwasher in a restaurant I would frequent. The guy who plays Capannelle, the sporty guy, wasn\u2019t an actor either. I think he was a bricklayer. Of course [Claudia] Cardinale wasn\u2019t an actress then either. But this way of shooting films was quite common in Italy, to use actors taken from the street. So because they didn\u2019t know how to recite their lines they had to be dubbed. On the other hand, you know that in Italy we speak many different dialects. So, for example, the actor who plays the Sicilian was not Sicilian. He was neither an actor, or a Sicilian! So I had to have a Sicilian dub his voice. Another one of the actors who was supposed to be Bolognesian (from Bologna) was from Naples, so I had to dub his voice. Cardinale spoke French so I had to dub her voice into Sicilian.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nThe apartment and pawnshop on \"Via della Madonna\" was in reality located at 7\u20138, Via delle Tre Canalle ({{Coord|41.896613|12.486|display=inline}}), immediately north of [[Trajan's Market]].

It also garnered the prestigious [[Silver Shell for Best Director]] at the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Festival]] in Spain.

They chose subtitles.<ref>New York Times. 13 Nov 1960: X9.</ref> (However, the dubbed version did make it to American TV in the early 1960s.)\n\nSeveral critics decried the subtitles. ''New York Times'' critic Bosley Crowther called it \"an essentially funny picture, artfully and joyously played. It\u2019s just too bad those incongruous, flat subtitles have to get in the way.\u201d <ref>New York Times. 23 Nov 1960: 20. </ref> ''Chicago Tribune'' critic James Rich liked the film but felt \u201cthe humor tarnished only when the parade of subtitles makes viewing a sort of exercise in speed reading.\u201d <ref>Chicago Daily Tribune;  Sep 8, 1961; pg. B15</ref> Philip K. Scheuer, in the ''Los Angeles Times,'' called it \u201ccleverly directed and acted...but there is one disadvantage for the linguistically limited: they have to wait to read the joke at the bottom of the screen, and by the time they can appreciate its purport the actors have already gone on to the next one.\u201d<ref>Los Angeles Times. 22 Sep 1961: A11.</ref>\n\nOther critics simply praised the film. The critic for the ''New York Herald-Tribune'' called it \u201cone of the most irresistible Italian comedies in years. No one with a sense of humor and an appreciation of humanity should miss it.\u201d <ref>Beckley, Paul V. New York Herald Tribune. 23 Nov 1960: 13.</ref> The ''Washington Post'' thought, \u201cMost unusual, however, and ever so clever, are the ways the script progresses to its climactic goof-up.\u201d<ref>The Washington Post. 08 June 1961: D8.</ref> The ''Baltimore Sun'' wrote, \u201cDirector Mario Monicelli has endowed the film with such flashes of brilliance, and the cast...has enacted it with such tasteful understatement, that \u2018The Big Deal on Madonna Street\u2019 must be listed as one of the funniest comedies of the last ten years.\u201d<ref>The Sun. 29 July 1961</ref>\n\nCrowther, in a follow-up essay, wrote, \u201cAlthough the routines have whiskers, so old and used in vaudeville are they, the picture has an ageless zest for laughter.\u201d<ref>Italian Comeback: Two Dandy Films Give Promise of Renascence.New York Times. 04 Dec 1960: X1.</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 89% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 9 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 7.47/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/big_deal_on_madonna_street |title=Big Deal on Madonna Street (I Soliti Ignoti) (1960) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=2019-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\nA sequel directed by [[Nanni Loy]] titled ''[[Audace colpo dei soliti ignoti]]'' (released in English as ''Hold-up \u00e0 la Milanaise'') followed in 1960, reuniting the entire cast aside from Tot\u00f2 and Mastroianni. A further sequel was directed by [[Amanzio Todini]] titled ''[[I Soliti ignoti vent'anni dopo]]'' (1987). It was released on DVD in the United States as ''Big Deal on Madonna Street - 20 Years Later'' by [[Koch Lorber]].\n\n==Remakes==\nTwo remakes of the film were shot in the United States: the 1984 film ''[[Crackers (1984 film)|Crackers]]'' by [[Louis Malle]] (set in [[San Francisco]]) and the 2002 film ''[[Welcome to Collinwood]]'' by [[Anthony Russo (director)|Anthony Russo]] and [[Joe Russo (director)|Joe Russo]] (set in [[Cleveland]]).\n\nBob Fosse created a Broadway musical titled ''[[Big Deal (musical)|Big Deal]]'' based on the film. Set in 1930s Chicago with an African-American cast and using popular songs of the era, the show opened at the Broadway Theatre on April 10, 1986 and closed on June 8, 1986 after 69 performances. It received five Tony Award nominations, with Fosse winning for Choreography.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 31st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0052216}}\n* {{Amg title|5408}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|big_deal_on_madonna_street}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|68650}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/142-big-deal-on-madonna-street ''Big Deal on Madonna Street''] an essay by Bruce Eder at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Mario Monicelli}}\n\n[[Category:1958 films]]\n[[Category:Italian films]]\n[[Category:Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:1950s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Italian heist films]]\n[[Category:Italian black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Commedia all'italiana]]\n[[Category:Italian crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mario Monicelli]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Piero Umiliani]]\n[[Category:Films set in Rome]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Suso Cecchi d'Amico]]\n[[Category:Lux Film films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Rome]]\n[[Category:1950s heist films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox film\n| name           = Big Deal on Madonna Street<br>(I soliti ignoti)\n| image          = SolitiIgnotiposter.jpg\n| caption        = Italian film poster\n| director       = [[Mario Monicelli]]\n| producer       = [[Franco Cristaldi]]\n| writer         = [[Age ~ Scarpelli]]<br />[[Suso Cecchi d'Amico]]<br />[[Mario Monicelli]]\n| starring       = [[Vittorio Gassman]]<br />[[Renato Salvatori]]<br />[[Memmo Carotenuto]]<br />[[Rossana Rory]]<br>[[Carla Gravina]]<br>[[Claudia Cardinale]]<br>[[Marcello Mastroianni]]<br />[[Tot\u00f2]]\n| music          = [[Piero Umiliani]]\n| cinematography = [[Gianni di Venanzo]] a.i.c.\n| editing        = [[Adriana Novelli]]\n| distributor    = [[Lux Film]]\n| released       = {{Film date|1958|6|30|df=y}}\n| runtime        = 111 minutes\n| country        = Italy\n| language       = Italian\n| budget         = \n| gross          = \n}}\n'''''Big Deal on Madonna Street''''' ({{lang-it|I soliti ignoti}}, also released as '''''Persons Unknown''''' in the [[UK]]) is a 1958 [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[caper film]] directed by [[Mario Monicelli]],<ref name=\"NY Times.com\">{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/5408/Big-Deal-on-Madonna-Street/details |title=NY Times: Big Deal on Madonna Street |accessdate=2009-03-21|work=NY Times.com}}</ref> and considered to be among the masterpieces of Italian cinema.

The film ends with a newspaper article recounting a robbery by unknown persons who apparently broke into an apartment to steal pasta with chickpeas.\n\n\n==Cast==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n{|class=wikitable\n!Actor!!Role (character names are not indicated in on-screen cast credits)\n|-\n|[[Vittorio Gassman]] ||Peppe il pantera\n|-\n|[[Renato Salvatori]]||Mario Angeletti\n|-\n|[[Memmo Carotenuto]] ||Cosimo\n|-\n|[[Rossana Rory]]||Norma\n|-\n|[[Carla Gravina]]||Nicoletta\n|-\n|[[Claudia Cardinale]]||Carmelina\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|[[Carlo Pisacane (actor)|Carlo Pisacane]]||Capannelle\n|-\n|[[Tiberio Murgia]]||Michele\n|-\n|Gina Rovere||Teresa, Tiberio's wife\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|Gina Amendola||Mario's \"Madre\"\n|-\n|Elvira Tonelli||Assunta\n|-\n|[[Elena Fabrizi]]||Signora Ada\n|-\n|Pasquale Misiano||Massimo\n|-\n|[[Renato Terra]]||Eladio\n|-\n|Aldo Trifiletti||Fernando the night porter\n|-\n|[[Nino Marchetti]]||Luigi\n|-\n|Mario De Simone||Receiver of stolen goods\n|}\n{{col-break|gap=2em}}\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n|''with'' [[Marcello Mastroianni]]||Tiberio\n|-\n|''and special participation of'' [[Tot\u00f2]]||Dante Cruciani\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{quote farm|section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:I soliti ignoti filming site.jpg|thumb|The building depicted in the film, photographed in 2019]]\nAccording to director Mario Monicelli, while the film was intended as a parody of neorealism, \"by then neorealism was already a thing of the past, something that was surpassed. It was more a parody that was aligned with a certain realism around us, with the poverty, and with people who had to do the best they could with whatever means possible to survive, with petty crimes. ...They are people without education or strong family support who are only attempting to survive. All my films have this type of theme or idea.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\">{{cite journal |last1=Totaro |first1=Donato |title=Interview with Mario Monicelli |journal=Offscreen |date=September 1999 |volume=3 |issue=5 |url=https://offscreen.com/view/mario_monicelli |accessdate=1 January 2019 |language=en |issn=1712-9559}}</ref>\n\nAsked if it was also a parody of [[Jules Dassin]]'s film ''[[Rififi]]'', Monicelli said, \"Yes because we saw this as a film shot in a very harsh, realist style. Very scientific, as the Peppe character continually says. So we wanted to do the same thing, but the characters didn't have the means. The way they worked was quite the contrary actually.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nMonicelli and cinematographer Gianni Di Venanzo agreed on a photographic tone that was not comedic or brightly lit. \"On the contrary,\" Monicelli said, \"harsh and dramatic, because the film has a dramatic side in that it is about poor people. We also have the death of Cosimo, and his funeral. So it's a comedy but with death. Which was something new at the time. It was rare to find death and failure in a comedy. I had difficulty making the film because the producers didn\u2019t want me to make it this way. With Vittorio Gassman who wasn\u2019t a comedian, with the film ending in failure, and with the death of a central character. All this made it difficult. But Di Venanzo understood the tone. To make people laugh with a story that was dramatic rather than comic. But seen with a comic eye.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nThe film was shot in ten weeks on locations throughout Rome. \"Even most of the interiors were on location,\" Monicelli said. \"The only interior that was shot in a studio was the wall that gets broken into at the end because I couldn\u2019t break a wall in an actual apartment! But all the other interiors were shot on location. Which of course was a particular trait of Italian cinema, to shoot on location. Especially in those days, although that tendency remains even in contemporary Italian cinema...There were not that many cars and little traffic. Italy was a poor country. People walked or took what little public transport there was, especially in the city peripherals. In the city centers of course it was a little busier, but still not heavy in traffic. Italy was a country not far removed from the war, with much visible destruction. That was the reality.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nAccording to Monicelli, the film adhered to the script, without improvisations. \"I don\u2019t do improvising,\" he said. \"I don't know how. I like to know everything in advance and spend a long time in preparation.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nDialogue, as was customary in Italian cinema, was all post-dubbed. Monicelli explained, \"First of all because in Italy we often shoot with actors who are not professional. For example the guy who plays the Sicilian, the jealous brother Ferribotte, was not an actor. He was a dishwasher in a restaurant I would frequent. The guy who plays Capannelle, the sporty guy, wasn\u2019t an actor either. I think he was a bricklayer. Of course [Claudia] Cardinale wasn\u2019t an actress then either. But this way of shooting films was quite common in Italy, to use actors taken from the street. So because they didn\u2019t know how to recite their lines they had to be dubbed. On the other hand, you know that in Italy we speak many different dialects. So, for example, the actor who plays the Sicilian was not Sicilian. He was neither an actor, or a Sicilian! So I had to have a Sicilian dub his voice. Another one of the actors who was supposed to be Bolognesian (from Bologna) was from Naples, so I had to dub his voice. Cardinale spoke French so I had to dub her voice into Sicilian.\"<ref name=\"monicelli interview\" />\n\nThe apartment and pawnshop on \"Via della Madonna\" was in reality located at 7\u20138, Via delle Tre Canalle ({{Coord|41.896613|12.486|display=inline}}), immediately north of [[Trajan's Market]].

It also garnered the prestigious [[Silver Shell for Best Director]] at the [[San Sebasti\u00e1n Film Festival]] in Spain. The film won Best Comedy at the 12th annual [[Locarno Film Festival]] in Switzerland.

They chose subtitles.<ref>New York Times. 13 Nov 1960: X9.</ref> (However, the dubbed version did make it to American TV in the early 1960s.)\n\nSeveral critics decried the subtitles. ''New York Times'' critic Bosley Crowther called it \"an essentially funny picture, artfully and joyously played. It\u2019s just too bad those incongruous, flat subtitles have to get in the way.\u201d <ref>New York Times. 23 Nov 1960: 20. </ref> ''Chicago Tribune'' critic James Rich liked the film but felt \u201cthe humor tarnished only when the parade of subtitles makes viewing a sort of exercise in speed reading.\u201d <ref>Chicago Daily Tribune;  Sep 8, 1961; pg. B15</ref> Philip K. Scheuer, in the ''Los Angeles Times,'' called it \u201ccleverly directed and acted...but there is one disadvantage for the linguistically limited: they have to wait to read the joke at the bottom of the screen, and by the time they can appreciate its purport the actors have already gone on to the next one.\u201d<ref>Los Angeles Times. 22 Sep 1961: A11.</ref>\n\nOther critics simply praised the film. The critic for the ''New York Herald-Tribune'' called it \u201cone of the most irresistible Italian comedies in years. No one with a sense of humor and an appreciation of humanity should miss it.\u201d <ref>Beckley, Paul V. New York Herald Tribune. 23 Nov 1960: 13.</ref> The ''Washington Post'' thought, \u201cMost unusual, however, and ever so clever, are the ways the script progresses to its climactic goof-up.\u201d<ref>The Washington Post. 08 June 1961: D8.</ref> The ''Baltimore Sun'' wrote, \u201cDirector Mario Monicelli has endowed the film with such flashes of brilliance, and the cast...has enacted it with such tasteful understatement, that \u2018The Big Deal on Madonna Street\u2019 must be listed as one of the funniest comedies of the last ten years.\u201d<ref>The Sun. 29 July 1961</ref>\n\nCrowther, in a follow-up essay, wrote, \u201cAlthough the routines have whiskers, so old and used in vaudeville are they, the picture has an ageless zest for laughter.\u201d<ref>Italian Comeback: Two Dandy Films Give Promise of Renascence.New York Times. 04 Dec 1960: X1.</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 89% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 9 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 7.47/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/big_deal_on_madonna_street |title=Big Deal on Madonna Street (I Soliti Ignoti) (1960) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=2019-05-02}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\nA sequel directed by [[Nanni Loy]] titled ''[[Audace colpo dei soliti ignoti]]'' (released in English as ''Hold-up \u00e0 la Milanaise'') followed in 1960, reuniting the entire cast aside from Tot\u00f2 and Mastroianni. A further sequel was directed by [[Amanzio Todini]] titled ''[[I Soliti ignoti vent'anni dopo]]'' (1987). It was released on DVD in the United States as ''Big Deal on Madonna Street - 20 Years Later'' by [[Koch Lorber]].\n\n==Remakes==\nTwo remakes of the film were shot in the United States: the 1984 film ''[[Crackers (1984 film)|Crackers]]'' by [[Louis Malle]] (set in [[San Francisco]]) and the 2002 film ''[[Welcome to Collinwood]]'' by [[Anthony Russo (director)|Anthony Russo]] and [[Joe Russo (director)|Joe Russo]] (set in [[Cleveland]]).\n\nBob Fosse created a Broadway musical titled ''[[Big Deal (musical)|Big Deal]]'' based on the film. Set in 1930s Chicago with an African-American cast and using popular songs of the era, the show opened at the Broadway Theatre on April 10, 1986 and closed on June 8, 1986 after 69 performances. It received five Tony Award nominations, with Fosse winning for Choreography.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of submissions to the 31st Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n* [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|0052216}}\n* {{Amg title|5408}}\n* {{Rotten-tomatoes|big_deal_on_madonna_street}}\n* {{Tcmdb title|68650}}\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/142-big-deal-on-madonna-street ''Big Deal on Madonna Street''] an essay by Bruce Eder at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Mario Monicelli}}\n\n[[Category:1958 films]]\n[[Category:Italian films]]\n[[Category:Italian-language films]]\n[[Category:1950s crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Italian heist films]]\n[[Category:Italian black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Commedia all'italiana]]\n[[Category:Italian crime comedy films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Mario Monicelli]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Piero Umiliani]]\n[[Category:Films set in Rome]]\n[[Category:Films with screenplays by Suso Cecchi d'Amico]]\n[[Category:Lux Film films]]\n[[Category:Films shot in Rome]]\n[[Category:1950s heist films]]\n", "name_user": "2pou", "label": "safe", "comment": "Bolding title perWP:R#ASTONISH", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Deal_on_Madonna_Street"}

Major lakes include [[Ross Barnett Reservoir]], [[Arkabutla Lake]], [[Sardis Lake (Mississippi)|Sardis Lake]], and [[Grenada Lake]] with the largest lake being Sardis Lake.\n\nMississippi is entirely composed of [[lowland]]s, the highest point being [[Woodall Mountain]], in the [[foothills]] of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], {{convert|807|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. The lowest point is sea level at the [[Gulf Coast]]. The state's mean elevation is {{convert|300|ft|m}} above sea level.\n\nMost of Mississippi is part of the East Gulf Coastal Plain. The [[coastal plain]] is generally composed of low hills, such as the Pine Hills in the south and the North Central Hills. The Pontotoc Ridge and the Fall Line Hills in the northeast have somewhat higher elevations. Yellow-brown [[loess]] soil is found in the western parts of the state. The northeast is a region of fertile black earth that extends into the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Alabama Black Belt]].\n\nThe coastline includes large bays at [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]]. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico proper by the shallow [[Mississippi Sound]], which is partially sheltered by [[Petit Bois Island (Mississippi)|Petit Bois Island]], [[Horn Island (Mississippi)|Horn Island]], [[Ship Island (Mississippi)|East and West Ship Islands]], [[Deer Island (Mississippi)|Deer Island]], [[Round Island (Mississippi)|Round Island]], and [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]].\n\nThe northwest remainder of the state consists of the [[Mississippi Delta]], a section of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]. The plain is narrow in the south and widens north of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. The region has rich soil, partly made up of [[silt]] which had been regularly deposited by the [[Flood plain|flood waters]] of the Mississippi River.\n\nAreas under the management of the [[National Park Service]] include:<ref>{{cite web|title=Mississippi |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ms}}</ref>\n*[[Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Site]] near [[Baldwyn, Mississippi|Baldwyn]]\n*[[Gulf Islands National Seashore]]\n*[[Natchez National Historical Park]] in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]\n*[[Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail]] in [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]]\n*[[Natchez Trace Parkway]]\n*[[Tupelo National Battlefield]] in Tupelo\n*[[Vicksburg National Military Park|Vicksburg National Military Park and Cemetery]] in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]\n\n===Major cities and towns===\n\n[[File:JacksonMS Downtown Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Jackson, Mississippi]]]]\n[[File:25thAve&13thSt.jpg|thumb|Northwest view of Gulfport Harbor Square Commercial Historic District]]\n[[File:Strawberry Patch Park 2009.jpg|thumb|Strawberry Patch Park, Madison]]\n[[File:Mississippi 90.jpg|thumb|Map with all counties and their county seats|alt=]]\n\nMississippi City Population Rankings of at least 50,000 ([[United States Census Bureau]] as of 2017):<ref name=\"Annual Population Estimates\">{{cite web|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}.

Temperatures average about 81\u00b0[[Fahrenheit|F]] (about 27\u00b0[[Celsius|C]]) in July and about 42&nbsp;\u00b0F (about 9&nbsp;\u00b0C) in January. The temperature varies little statewide in the summer; however, in winter, the region near [[Mississippi Sound]] is significantly warmer than the inland portion of the state. The recorded temperature in Mississippi has ranged from {{cvt|-19|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, in 1966, at [[Corinth, Mississippi|Corinth]] in the northeast, to {{cvt|115|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, in 1930, at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] in the north. Heavy snowfall rarely occurs, but isn't unheard of, such as during the [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]]. Yearly [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] generally increases from north to south, with the regions closer to the Gulf being the most humid. Thus, [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], in the northwest, gets about 50&nbsp;inches (about 1,270&nbsp;mm) of precipitation annually and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], in the south, about 61 inches (about 1,550&nbsp;mm). Small amounts of snow fall in northern and central Mississippi; snow is occasional in the southern part of the state.\n\nThe late summer and fall is the seasonal period of risk for [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico, especially in the southern part of the state. [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969 and [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, which killed 238 people in the state, were the most devastating hurricanes to hit the state. Both caused nearly total [[storm surge]] destruction of structures in and around [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]].\n\nAs in the rest of the [[Deep South]], thunderstorms are common in Mississippi, especially in the southern part of the state. On average, Mississippi has around 27 [[tornado]]es annually; the northern part of the state has more tornadoes earlier in the year and the southern part a higher frequency later in the year. Two of the five deadliest tornadoes in U.S. history have occurred in the state. These storms struck [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]], in southwest Mississippi (see [[The Great Natchez Tornado]]) and [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]], in the northeast corner of the state. About seven F5 tornadoes have been recorded in the state.\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \"style=text-align:center;font-size:90%;\" \n| colspan = \"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:120%;background:#E8EAFA;\" | Monthly normal high and low temperatures (\u00b0F) for various Mississippi cities\n|-\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa; height:17px;\"| City\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Jan\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Feb\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Mar\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Apr\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| May\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Jun\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Jul\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Aug\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Sep\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Oct\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Nov\n! style=\"background:#e5afaa;| Dec\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; height:16px;\"| Gulfport\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 61/43\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 64/46\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 70/52\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 77/59\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 84/66\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 89/72\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 91/74\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 91/74\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 87/70\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 79/60\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 70/51\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 63/45\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; height:16px;\"| Jackson\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 55/35\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 60/38\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 68/45\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 75/52\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 82/61\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 89/68\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 91/71\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 91/70\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 86/65\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 77/52\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 66/43\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 58/37\n|-\n! style=\"background:#c5dfe1; height:16px;\"| Meridian\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 58/35\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 63/38\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 70/44\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 77/50\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 84/60\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 90/67\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 93/70\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 93/70\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 88/64\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 78/51\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 68/43\n| style=\"background:#c5dfe1;\"| 60/37\n|-\n! style=\"background:#f8f3ca; height:16px;\"| Tupelo\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 50/30\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 56/34\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 65/41\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 74/48\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 81/58\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 88/66\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 91/70\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 91/68\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 85/62\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 75/49\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 63/40\n| style=\"background:#f8f3ca;\"| 54/33\n|-\n| colspan = \"13\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;background:#E8EAFA;\" | Source:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustravelweather.com/mississippi/|title=Mississippi Weather-Mississippi Weather Forecast-Mississippi Climate|website=ustravelweather.com|accessdate=September 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121155657/http://www.ustravelweather.com/mississippi/|archive-date=November 21, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|}\n\n{{Weather box/concise_F\n| location=Mississippi (1980\u20132010)\n| source=USA.com<ref name=\"USA\">\n  {{cite web|title=Climatological Information for Mississippi |\n  website=USA.com |date=2003 |url=http://www.usa.com/mississippi-state-weather.htm#HistoricalTemperature}}</ref>\n| 54.3| 58.7| 67.2| 75.2| 82.6| 88.9| 91.4| 91.5| 86.3| 76.9| 66.5| 56.6 <!--highs-->\n| 33.3| 36.7| 43.8| 51.3| 60.3| 67.6| 70.6| 69.7| 63| 51.9| 43.1| 35.7 <!--lows-->\n|5.0|5.2|5.1|5.0|5.1|4.4|4.5|3.9|3.6|4.1|4.9|5.7 <!--precipitation-->\n}}\n\n===Ecology, flora, and fauna===\n\n[[File:Welcometomississippi i-20.jpg|right|thumb|Leaving Alabama on I-20/59]]\n[[File:Clark creek natural area ms.jpg|thumb|Clark Creek Natural Area, Wilkinson County]]\n\nMississippi is heavily forested, with over half of the state's area covered by wild or cultivated trees.

The river's flooding created natural levees, which planters had built higher to try to prevent flooding of land cultivated for cotton crops. Temporary workers built [[levees]] along the Mississippi River on top of the natural levees that formed from dirt deposited after the river flooded.\n\nFrom 1858 to 1861, the state took over levee building, accomplishing it through contractors and hired labor. In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work. Contractors hired gangs of Irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land. Many of the Irish were relatively recent immigrants from the famine years who were struggling to get established.<ref>{{cite book|first=David R. |last=Roediger|title=The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class|location=New York|publisher=Verso|year=1999|page=146|isbn=978-1859842409}}</ref> Before the [[American Civil War]], the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height, although in some areas they reached twenty feet.\n\nFlooding has been an integral part of Mississippi history, but clearing of the land for cultivation and to supply wood fuel for steamboats took away the absorption of trees and undergrowth. The banks of the river were denuded, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river. After the Civil War, major floods swept down the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882.

Regional losses and the Mississippi River Levee Association's lobbying for a flood control bill helped gain passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local levee districts, on a scale of 2:1. Although U.S. participation in [[World War I]] interrupted funding of levees, the second round of funding helped raise the average height of levees in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to {{convert|22|ft|m}} in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|first=John Otto |last=Solomon|title=The Final Frontiers, 1880\u20131930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|page=50|isbn=978-0313289637}}</ref> Scientists now understand the levees have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow speed of the river and reducing the area of the floodplains. The region was severely damaged due to the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], which broke through the levees. There were losses of millions of dollars in property, stock and crops. The most damage occurred in the lower Delta, including [[Washington County, Mississippi|Washington]] and [[Bolivar County, Mississippi|Bolivar]] counties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Solomon|date=1999|title=The Final Frontiers|page=70}}</ref>\n\nEven as scientific knowledge about the Mississippi River has grown, upstream development and the consequences of the levees have caused more severe flooding in some years. Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of the levees have changed the nature of the river. Such work removed the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, strengthening the river's current. The state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecology.\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of Mississippi}}\n{{Wikipedia:WikiProject Mississippi/MississippiSymbols}}\n\nNear 10,000 BC [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s or [[Paleo-Indians]] arrived in what today is referred to as the [[Southern United States|American South]].<ref name=\"guy_prentice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |title=Pushmataha, Choctaw Indian Chief |accessdate=February 11, 2008 |last=Prentice |first=Guy |year=2003 |publisher=Southeast Chronicles |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202132723/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2007 }}\n</ref> Paleo-Indians in the South were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who pursued the [[Pleistocene megafauna|megafauna]] that became extinct following the end of the [[Pleistocene]] age.

Their large earthworks, which expressed their cosmology of political and religious concepts, still stand throughout the [[Mississippi River Valley|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River Valley|Ohio River]] valleys.\n[[File:Choctaw Village by Francois Bernard.jpg|thumb|''Choctaw Village near the Chefuncte'', by Francois Bernard, 1869, Peabody Museum\u2014Harvard University.

Other tribes who inhabited the territory of Mississippi (and whose names were honored by colonists in local towns) include the [[Natchez people|Natchez]], the [[Yazoo tribe|Yazoo]], and the [[Biloxi people|Biloxi]].\n\nThe first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer, [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]], who passed through the northeast part of the state in 1540, in his second expedition to the New World.\n\n===Colonial era===\n\n{{Main|New France|Louisiana (New France)|French and Indian War|Treaty of Paris (1763)|New Spain|West Florida|Indian Reserve (1763)|American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)|Spanish West Florida}}\n\nIn April 1699, French colonists established the first European settlement at ''[[Fort Maurepas]]'' (also known as Old Biloxi), built in the vicinity of present-day [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]] on the Gulf Coast. It was settled by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]]. In 1716, the French founded [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] on the Mississippi River (as ''[[Fort Rosalie]]''); it became the dominant town and trading post of the area. The French called the greater territory \"[[Louisiana (New France)|New France]]\"; the Spanish continued to claim part of the [[Gulf coast]] area (east of [[Mobile Bay]]) of present-day southern [[Alabama]], in addition to the entire area of present-day [[Florida]].\n[[File:Pushmataha high resolution.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Pushmataha]], Choctaw Principal Chief]]\n\nThrough the 18th century, the area was ruled variously by Spanish, French, and British colonial governments. The colonists imported African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] as laborers. Under French and Spanish rule, there developed a class of [[free people of color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), mostly [[multiracial]] descendants of European men and enslaved or free black women, and their [[mixed-race]] children. In the early days the French and Spanish colonists were chiefly men. Even as more European women joined the settlements, the men had interracial unions among women of African descent (and increasingly, multiracial descent), both before and after marriages to European women. Often the European men would help their multiracial children get educated or gain apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settled property on them; they often freed the mothers and their children if enslaved, as part of contracts of ''[[pla\u00e7age]]''. With this [[social capital]], the free people of color became artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and property owners, forming a third class between the Europeans and most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish settlements, although not so large a free community as in the city of [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.\n\nAfter Great Britain's victory in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]), the French surrendered the Mississippi area to them under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]]. They also ceded their areas to the north that were east of the Mississippi River, including the Illinois Country and Quebec. After the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]], the lower third of Mississippi came under Spanish rule as part of [[West Florida]]. In 1819 the United States completed the purchase of West Florida and all of [[East Florida]] in the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], and in 1822 both were merged into the [[Florida Territory]].\n\n===United States territory===\n\n{{Main|Seminole Wars|Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Organic act#List of organic acts|Mississippi Territory}}\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u201383), Britain ceded this area to the new United States of America. The [[Mississippi Territory]] was [[Territories of the United States|organized]] on April 7, 1798, from territory ceded by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] to the United States. Their original colonial charters theoretically extended west to the Pacific Ocean. The Mississippi Territory was later twice expanded to include disputed territory claimed by both the United States and Spain.\n\nFrom 1800 to about 1830, the United States purchased some lands ([[Treaty of Doak's Stand]]) from Native American tribes for new settlements of European Americans; they were mostly migrants from other Southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were exhausted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ben |last=Wynne|title=Mississippi (On-The-Road Histories)|year=2007|page=12|isbn=978-1566566667}}</ref> On September 27, 1830, the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] was signed between the U.S. Government and the [[Choctaw]]. The Choctaw agreed to sell their traditional homelands in Mississippi and Alabama, for compensation and [[Indian Removal|removal]] to reservations in [[Indian Territory]] (now Oklahoma). This opened up land for sale to [[European-American]] immigrant settlement. Article 14 in the treaty allowed those Choctaw who chose to remain in the state to become U.S. citizens, as they were considered to be giving up their tribal membership. They were the second major non-European ethnic group to do so (the Cherokee were the first).<ref name=\"us_citizenship\">\n{{cite web\n |url=http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/cho0310.htm#mn15 \n |title=Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties Vol. II, Treaties \n |accessdate=April 16, 2008 \n |last=Kappler \n |first=Charles \n |year=1904 \n |publisher=Government Printing Office \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517182743/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/cho0310.htm \n |archivedate=May 17, 2008 \n |df=mdy-all \n}}\n</ref><ref name=\"david_baird\">\n{{Cite book\n| last = Baird\n| first = W.

They used some of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves. The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites, played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for [[secession]]. Mississippi was a slave society, with the economy dependent on slavery. The state was thinly settled, with population concentrated in the riverfront areas and towns.\n\nBy 1860, the enslaved African-American population numbered 436,631 or 55% of the state's total of 791,305 persons.

The first six states to secede were those with the highest number of slaves. During the war, Union and Confederate forces struggled for dominance on the Mississippi River, critical to supply routes and commerce. More than 80,000 Mississippians fought in the [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Civil War]], and casualties were extremely heavy. Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s long siege of [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] finally gained the Union control of the river in 1863.\n\nIn the postwar period, [[freedmen]] withdrew from white-run churches to set up independent congregations. The majority of blacks left the Southern Baptist Church, sharply reducing its membership. They created independent black Baptist congregations. By 1895 they had established numerous black Baptist state associations and the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] of black churches.<ref name=\"campbell\"/>\n\nIn addition, independent black denominations, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (established in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in the early 19th century) and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] (established in New York City), sent [[missionaries]] to the South in the postwar years. They quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the South.

After the Civil War, tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land. In addition, black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and selling timber, and eventually advance to ownership. The new farmers included many freedmen, who by the late 19th century achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the Mississippi bottomlands. In the 1870s and 1880s, many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta were [[African American]].<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/> But many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the difficult years of the late 19th century. Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, numerous African-American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by hard, personal labor.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nDemocrats had regained control of the state legislature in 1875, after a year of expanded violence against blacks and intimidation of whites in what was called the \"white line\" campaign, based on asserting [[white supremacy]]. Democratic whites were well armed and formed [[paramilitary]] organizations such as the [[Red Shirts (southern United States)|Red Shirts]] to suppress black voting. From 1874 to the elections of 1875, they pressured whites to join the Democrats, and conducted violence against blacks in at least 15 known \"riots\" in cities around the state to intimidate blacks. They killed a total of 150 blacks, although other estimates place the death toll at twice as many. A total of three white Republicans and five white Democrats were reported killed. In rural areas, deaths of blacks could be covered up. Riots (better described as massacres of blacks) took place in Vicksburg, Clinton, Macon, and in their counties, as well-armed whites broke up black meetings and [[lynching|lynched]] known black leaders, destroying local political organizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wharton|first=V.

Together with imposition of [[Jim Crow]] and racial segregation laws, whites increased violence against blacks, lynching mostly men, through the period of the 1890s and extending to 1930. Cotton crops failed due to [[boll weevil]] infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913, creating crisis conditions for many African Americans. With control of the ballot box and more access to credit, white planters bought out such farmers, expanding their ownership of Delta bottomlands.

They sought jobs, better education for their children, the right to vote, relative freedom from discrimination, and better living. In the migration of 1910\u20131940, they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity. Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors.\n\nBlacks also faced violence in the form of lynching, shooting, and the burning of churches.

The African-American call for social equality resonated throughout the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s and [[World War II]] in the 1940s.\n\nThe [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] from the South started in the 1940s, lasting until 1970. Almost half a million people left Mississippi in the second migration, three-quarters of them black. Nationwide during the first half of the 20th century, African Americans became rapidly urbanized and many worked in industrial jobs. The Second Great Migration included destinations in the [[Western United States|West]], especially [[California]], where the buildup of the defense industry offered higher paying jobs to both African Americans and whites.\n\nBlacks and whites in Mississippi generated rich, quintessentially American music traditions: [[gospel music]], [[country music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[rock and roll]]. All were invented, promulgated or heavily developed by Mississippi musicians, many of them African American, and most came from the [[Mississippi Delta]]. Many musicians carried their music north to Chicago, where they made it the heart of that city's jazz and blues.\n\nSo many African Americans left in the Great Migration that after the 1930s, they became a minority in Mississippi. In 1960 they made up 42% of the state's population.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1960 United States Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}, accessed March 13, 2008</ref> The whites maintained their discriminatory voter registration processes established in 1890, preventing most blacks from voting, even if they were well educated. Court challenges were not successful until later in the century. After World War II, African-American veterans returned with renewed commitment to be treated as full citizens of the United States and increasingly organized to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights.\n\nThe [[Civil Rights Movement]] had many roots in religion, and the strong community of churches helped supply volunteers and moral purpose for their activism. Mississippi was a center of activity, based in black churches, to educate and register black voters, and to work for integration. In 1954 the state had created the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], a tax-supported agency, chaired by the Governor, that claimed to work for the state's image but effectively spied on activists and passed information to the local White Citizens' Councils to suppress black activism. [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Councils]] had been formed in many cities and towns to resist integration of schools following the unanimous 1954 [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling (''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'') that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. They used intimidation and economic blackmail against activists and suspected activists, including teachers and other professionals. Techniques included loss of jobs and eviction from rental housing.\n\nIn the summer of 1964 students and community organizers from across the country came to help register black voters in Mississippi and establish [[Freedom Schools]]. The [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] was established to challenge the all-white Democratic Party of the [[Solid South]]. Most white politicians resisted such changes. Chapters of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its sympathizers used violence against activists, most notably the [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]] in 1964 during the [[Freedom Summer]] campaign. This was a catalyst for Congressional passage the following year of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

The total population has not increased significantly, but is young. Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births. But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity. A binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of [[racial segregation]]. In the civil rights era, people of African descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rights.\n\nAs the demographer [[William H. Frey]] noted, \"In Mississippi, I think it's [identifying as mixed race] changed from within.\"<ref name=\"NYTrace\"/> Historically in Mississippi, after [[Indian removal]] in the 1830s, the major groups were designated as black (African American), who were then mostly enslaved, and white (primarily European American).

African Americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern [[Mississippi Delta|Yazoo Delta]], and the southwestern and the central parts of the state.

They educated their children privately. [[Industrialization]] did not reach many areas until the late 20th century. The planter [[aristocracy]], the elite of [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] Mississippi, kept the tax structure low for their own benefit, making only private improvements. Before the war the most successful planters, such as [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] President [[Jefferson Davis]], owned riverside properties along the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers in the Mississippi Delta. Away from the riverfronts, most of the Delta was undeveloped frontier.\n\nDuring the Civil War, 30,000 Mississippi soldiers, mostly white, died from wounds and disease, and many more were left crippled and wounded. Changes to the labor structure and an agricultural depression throughout the South caused severe losses in wealth. In 1860 assessed valuation of property in Mississippi had been more than $500&nbsp;million, of which $218&nbsp;million (43 percent) was estimated as the value of slaves. By 1870, total assets had decreased in value to roughly $177&nbsp;million.<ref>W. E. B. DuBois,''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860\u20131880''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935; reprint New York: The Free Press, 1998, p. 432</ref>\n\nPoor whites and landless former slaves suffered the most from the postwar economic depression. The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief of the state and its citizens. The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes.<ref>Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', p. 437</ref> It took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles. The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.<ref>Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', pp. 432, 434</ref>\n\nBlacks cleared land, selling timber and developing bottomland to achieve ownership. In 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, a major achievement for them and their families. Due to the poor economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nAfter the Civil War, the state refused for years to build human capital by fully educating all its citizens. In addition, the reliance on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of cotton crops due to the devastation of the [[boll weevil]] in the early 20th century, devastating floods in 1912\u20131913 and 1927, collapse of cotton prices after 1920, and drought in 1930.<ref name=\"Solomon Final Frontiers\"/>\n\nIt was not until 1884, after the flood of 1882, that the state created the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta District Levee Board and started successfully achieving longer term plans for levees in the upper Delta.<ref name=\"about the levee\"/> Despite the state's building and reinforcing levees for years, the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] broke through and caused massive flooding of {{convert|27000|sqmi|km2}} throughout the Delta, homelessness for hundreds of thousands, and millions of dollars in property damages.

The first school for black students was not established until 1862.\n\nDuring Reconstruction in 1871, black and white Republicans drafted a constitution that was the first to provide for a system of free [[public education]] in the state. The state's dependence on agriculture and resistance to taxation limited the funds it had available to spend on any schools. In the early 20th century, there were still few schools in rural areas, particularly for black children. With seed money from the [[Julius Rosenwald]] Fund, many rural black communities across Mississippi raised matching funds and contributed public funds to build new schools for their children. Essentially, many black adults taxed themselves twice and made significant sacrifices to raise money for the education of children in their communities, in many cases donating land and/or labor to build such schools.<ref>James D.

In the majority-black Mississippi Delta counties, white parents worked through [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Councils]] to set up private [[segregation academies]], where they enrolled their children. Often funding declined for the public schools.<ref name=\"bolton178\"/>\n\nBut in the state as a whole, only a small minority of white children were withdrawn from public schools. State officials believed they needed to maintain public education to attract new businesses. After several years of integration, whites often dominated local systems anyway, maintaining white supremacy. Many black parents complained that they had little representation in school administration, and that many of their former administrators and teachers had been pushed out. They have had to work to have their interests and children represented.<ref name=\"bolton178\">Bolton, Charles C.

Although by the end of the 19th century, two-thirds of the farm owners were black, continued low prices for cotton and national financial pressures resulted in most of them losing their land. More problems built up with the boll weevil infestation, when thousands of agricultural jobs were lost.\n\n[[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], a native of Meridian and guitarist/singer/songwriter known as the \"Father of Country Music\", played a significant role in the development of the blues. He and [[Chester Arthur Burnett]] were friends and admirers of each other's music. Their friendship and respect is an important example of Mississippi's musical legacy. While the state has had a reputation for being the most racist in the United States{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}, individual musicians created an integrated music community. Mississippi musicians created new forms by combining and creating variations on musical traditions from Africa with the musical traditions of white Southerners, a tradition largely rooted in Scots\u2013Irish music.\n\nThe state is creating a [[Mississippi Blues Trail]], with dedicated markers explaining historic sites significant to the history of blues music, such as [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]]'s Riverside Hotel, where [[Bessie Smith]] died after her auto accident on [[U.S. Route 61|Highway 61]]. The Riverside Hotel is just one of many historical blues sites in Clarksdale. The [[Delta Blues Museum]] there is visited by tourists from all over the world.

The northwest remainder of the state consists of the [[Mississippi Delta]], a section of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]. Mississippi's highest point is [[Woodall Mountain]] at 807 feet (246 m) above sea level adjacent to the [[Cumberland Plateau]]; the lowest is the Gulf of Mexico. Mississippi has a [[humid subtropical climate]] classification.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe state's name is derived from the [[Mississippi River]], which flows along its western boundary. Settlers named it after the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word ''misi-ziibi'' (\"Great River\").\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Map of Mississippi NA.png|thumb|upright=1.35| ]]\n[[File:Wolf-River-swamp-North-Mississippi.jpg|thumb|Bottomland hardwood swamp near [[Ashland, Mississippi|Ashland]]]]\n\nMississippi is bordered to the north by [[Tennessee]], to the east by [[Alabama]], to the south by [[Louisiana]] and a narrow coast on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]; and to the west, across the Mississippi River, by Louisiana and [[Arkansas]].\n\nIn addition to its namesake, major rivers in Mississippi include the [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]], the [[Pearl River (Mississippi-Louisiana)|Pearl River]], the [[Yazoo River]], the [[Pascagoula River]], and the [[Tombigbee River]]. Major lakes include [[Ross Barnett Reservoir]], [[Arkabutla Lake]], [[Sardis Lake (Mississippi)|Sardis Lake]], and [[Grenada Lake]] with the largest lake being Sardis Lake.\n\nMississippi is entirely composed of [[lowland]]s, the highest point being [[Woodall Mountain]], in the [[foothills]] of the [[Cumberland Mountains]], {{convert|807|ft|m}} above [[sea level]]. The lowest point is sea level at the [[Gulf Coast]]. The state's mean elevation is {{convert|300|ft|m}} above sea level.\n\nMost of Mississippi is part of the East Gulf Coastal Plain. The [[coastal plain]] is generally composed of low hills, such as the Pine Hills in the south and the North Central Hills. The Pontotoc Ridge and the Fall Line Hills in the northeast have somewhat higher elevations. Yellow-brown [[loess]] soil is found in the western parts of the state. The northeast is a region of fertile black earth that extends into the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Alabama Black Belt]].\n\nThe coastline includes large bays at [[Bay St. Louis, Mississippi|Bay St. Louis]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]]. It is separated from the Gulf of Mexico proper by the shallow [[Mississippi Sound]], which is partially sheltered by [[Petit Bois Island (Mississippi)|Petit Bois Island]], [[Horn Island (Mississippi)|Horn Island]], [[Ship Island (Mississippi)|East and West Ship Islands]], [[Deer Island (Mississippi)|Deer Island]], [[Round Island (Mississippi)|Round Island]], and [[Cat Island (Mississippi)|Cat Island]].\n\nThe northwest remainder of the state consists of the [[Mississippi Delta]], a section of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]]. The plain is narrow in the south and widens north of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]. The region has rich soil, partly made up of [[silt]] which had been regularly deposited by the [[Flood plain|flood waters]] of the Mississippi River.\n\nAreas under the management of the [[National Park Service]] include:<ref>{{cite web|title=Mississippi |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/state/ms}}</ref>\n*[[Brices Cross Roads National Battlefield Site]] near [[Baldwyn, Mississippi|Baldwyn]]\n*[[Gulf Islands National Seashore]]\n*[[Natchez National Historical Park]] in [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]]\n*[[Natchez Trace National Scenic Trail]] in [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]]\n*[[Natchez Trace Parkway]]\n*[[Tupelo National Battlefield]] in Tupelo\n*[[Vicksburg National Military Park|Vicksburg National Military Park and Cemetery]] in [[Vicksburg, Mississippi|Vicksburg]]\n\n===Major cities and towns===\n\n[[File:JacksonMS Downtown Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Jackson, Mississippi]]]]\n[[File:25thAve&13thSt.jpg|thumb|Northwest view of Gulfport Harbor Square Commercial Historic District]]\n[[File:Strawberry Patch Park 2009.jpg|thumb|Strawberry Patch Park, Madison]]\n[[File:Mississippi 90.jpg|thumb|Map with all counties and their county seats|alt=]]\n\nMississippi City Population Rankings of at least 50,000 ([[United States Census Bureau]] as of 2017):<ref name=\"Annual Population Estimates\">{{cite web|url=https://census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/total-cities-and-towns.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=March 2, 2019}}.

Temperatures average about 81\u00b0[[Fahrenheit|F]] (about 27\u00b0[[Celsius|C]]) in July and about 42&nbsp;\u00b0F (about 9&nbsp;\u00b0C) in January. The temperature varies little statewide in the summer; however, in winter, the region near [[Mississippi Sound]] is significantly warmer than the inland portion of the state. The recorded temperature in Mississippi has ranged from {{cvt|-19|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, in 1966, at [[Corinth, Mississippi|Corinth]] in the northeast, to {{cvt|115|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, in 1930, at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]] in the north. Heavy snowfall rarely occurs, but isn't unheard of, such as during the [[New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm]]. Yearly [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] generally increases from north to south, with the regions closer to the Gulf being the most humid. Thus, [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]], in the northwest, gets about 50&nbsp;inches (about 1,270&nbsp;mm) of precipitation annually and [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], in the south, about 61 inches (about 1,550&nbsp;mm). Small amounts of snow fall in northern and central Mississippi; snow is occasional in the southern part of the state.\n\nThe late summer and fall is the seasonal period of risk for [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] moving inland from the Gulf of Mexico, especially in the southern part of the state. [[Hurricane Camille]] in 1969 and [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, which killed 238 people in the state, were the most devastating hurricanes to hit the state. Both caused nearly total [[storm surge]] destruction of structures in and around [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], and [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]].\n\nAs in the rest of the [[Deep South]], thunderstorms are common in Mississippi, especially in the southern part of the state. On average, Mississippi has around 27 [[tornado]]es annually; the northern part of the state has more tornadoes earlier in the year and the southern part a higher frequency later in the year.

The river's flooding created natural levees, which planters had built higher to try to prevent flooding of land cultivated for cotton crops. Temporary workers built [[levees]] along the Mississippi River on top of the natural levees that formed from dirt deposited after the river flooded.\n\nFrom 1858 to 1861, the state took over levee building, accomplishing it through contractors and hired labor. In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work. Contractors hired gangs of Irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land. Many of the Irish were relatively recent immigrants from the famine years who were struggling to get established.<ref>{{cite book|first=David R. |last=Roediger|title=The Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class|location=New York|publisher=Verso|year=1999|page=146|isbn=978-1859842409}}</ref> Before the [[American Civil War]], the earthwork levees averaged six feet in height, although in some areas they reached twenty feet.\n\nFlooding has been an integral part of Mississippi history, but clearing of the land for cultivation and to supply wood fuel for steamboats took away the absorption of trees and undergrowth. The banks of the river were denuded, becoming unstable and changing the character of the river. After the Civil War, major floods swept down the valley in 1865, 1867, 1874 and 1882. Such floods regularly overwhelmed levees damaged by Confederate and Union fighting during the war, as well as those constructed after the war.<ref name=\"John Otto Solomon 1999, pp.10-11\">{{cite book|first=John Otto |last=Solomon|title=The Final Frontiers, 1880\u20131930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|pages=10\u201311}}</ref> In 1877, the state created the Mississippi Levee District for southern counties.\n\nIn 1879, the [[United States Congress]] created the [[Mississippi River Commission]], whose responsibilities included aiding state levee boards in the construction of levees. Both white and black transient workers were hired to build the levees in the late 19th century. By 1882, levees averaged seven feet in height, but many in the southern Delta were severely tested by the flood that year.<ref name=\"John Otto Solomon 1999, pp.10-11\"/> After the 1882 flood, the levee system was expanded. In 1884, the Yazoo-Mississippi Delta Levee District was established to oversee levee construction and maintenance in the northern Delta counties; also included were some counties in [[Arkansas]] which were part of the Delta.<ref name=\"about the levee\">{{cite web|url=http://www.leveeboard.org/about_the_levee/history/physical_development.html |title=About the levee: Physical development of a levee system |publisher=Leveeboard.org |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513142502/http://www.leveeboard.org/about_the_levee/history/physical_development.html |archivedate=May 13, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFlooding overwhelmed northwestern Mississippi in 1912\u20131913, causing heavy damage to the levee districts. Regional losses and the Mississippi River Levee Association's lobbying for a flood control bill helped gain passage of national bills in 1917 and 1923 to provide federal matching funds for local levee districts, on a scale of 2:1. Although U.S. participation in [[World War I]] interrupted funding of levees, the second round of funding helped raise the average height of levees in the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta to {{convert|22|ft|m}} in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|first=John Otto |last=Solomon|title=The Final Frontiers, 1880\u20131930: Settling the Southern Bottomlands|location=Westport|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1999|page=50|isbn=978-0313289637}}</ref> Scientists now understand the levees have increased the severity of flooding by increasing the flow speed of the river and reducing the area of the floodplains. The region was severely damaged due to the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], which broke through the levees. There were losses of millions of dollars in property, stock and crops. The most damage occurred in the lower Delta, including [[Washington County, Mississippi|Washington]] and [[Bolivar County, Mississippi|Bolivar]] counties.<ref>{{cite book|author=Solomon|date=1999|title=The Final Frontiers|page=70}}</ref>\n\nEven as scientific knowledge about the Mississippi River has grown, upstream development and the consequences of the levees have caused more severe flooding in some years. Scientists now understand that the widespread clearing of land and building of the levees have changed the nature of the river. Such work removed the natural protection and absorption of wetlands and forest cover, strengthening the river's current. The state and federal governments have been struggling for the best approaches to restore some natural habitats in order to best interact with the original riverine ecology.\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of Mississippi}}\n{{Wikipedia:WikiProject Mississippi/MississippiSymbols}}\n\nNear 10,000 BC [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]s or [[Paleo-Indians]] arrived in what today is referred to as the [[Southern United States|American South]].<ref name=\"guy_prentice\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |title=Pushmataha, Choctaw Indian Chief |accessdate=February 11, 2008 |last=Prentice |first=Guy |year=2003 |publisher=Southeast Chronicles |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202132723/http://www.nps.gov/history/seac/SoutheastChronicles/NISI/NISI%20Cultural%20Overview.htm |archivedate=December 2, 2007 }}\n</ref> Paleo-Indians in the South were [[hunter-gatherer]]s who pursued the [[Pleistocene megafauna|megafauna]] that became extinct following the end of the [[Pleistocene]] age.

Both were [[Mound builder (people)|mound builder]] cultures. Those of the [[Mississippian culture]] were the largest and most complex, constructed beginning about 950&nbsp;AD. The peoples had a trading network spanning the continent from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. Their large earthworks, which expressed their cosmology of political and religious concepts, still stand throughout the [[Mississippi River Valley|Mississippi]] and [[Ohio River Valley|Ohio River]] valleys.\n[[File:Choctaw Village by Francois Bernard.jpg|thumb|''Choctaw Village near the Chefuncte'', by Francois Bernard, 1869, Peabody Museum\u2014Harvard University.

Other tribes who inhabited the territory of Mississippi (and whose names were honored by colonists in local towns) include the [[Natchez people|Natchez]], the [[Yazoo tribe|Yazoo]], and the [[Biloxi people|Biloxi]].\n\nThe first major European expedition into the territory that became Mississippi was that of the Spanish explorer, [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]], who passed through the northeast part of the state in 1540, in his second expedition to the New World.\n\n===Colonial era===\n\n{{Main|New France|Louisiana (New France)|French and Indian War|Treaty of Paris (1763)|New Spain|West Florida|Indian Reserve (1763)|American Revolutionary War|Treaty of Paris (1783)|Spanish West Florida}}\n\nIn April 1699, French colonists established the first European settlement at ''[[Fort Maurepas]]'' (also known as Old Biloxi), built in the vicinity of present-day [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi|Ocean Springs]] on the Gulf Coast. It was settled by [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]]. In 1716, the French founded [[Natchez, Mississippi|Natchez]] on the Mississippi River (as ''[[Fort Rosalie]]''); it became the dominant town and trading post of the area. The French called the greater territory \"[[Louisiana (New France)|New France]]\"; the Spanish continued to claim part of the [[Gulf coast]] area (east of [[Mobile Bay]]) of present-day southern [[Alabama]], in addition to the entire area of present-day [[Florida]].\n[[File:Pushmataha high resolution.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Pushmataha]], Choctaw Principal Chief]]\n\nThrough the 18th century, the area was ruled variously by Spanish, French, and British colonial governments. The colonists imported African [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] as laborers. Under French and Spanish rule, there developed a class of [[free people of color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), mostly [[multiracial]] descendants of European men and enslaved or free black women, and their [[mixed-race]] children. In the early days the French and Spanish colonists were chiefly men. Even as more European women joined the settlements, the men had interracial unions among women of African descent (and increasingly, multiracial descent), both before and after marriages to European women. Often the European men would help their multiracial children get educated or gain apprenticeships for trades, and sometimes they settled property on them; they often freed the mothers and their children if enslaved, as part of contracts of ''[[pla\u00e7age]]''. With this [[social capital]], the free people of color became artisans, and sometimes educated merchants and property owners, forming a third class between the Europeans and most enslaved Africans in the French and Spanish settlements, although not so large a free community as in the city of [[New Orleans]], Louisiana.\n\nAfter Great Britain's victory in the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]), the French surrendered the Mississippi area to them under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]]. They also ceded their areas to the north that were east of the Mississippi River, including the Illinois Country and Quebec. After the [[Peace of Paris (1783)]], the lower third of Mississippi came under Spanish rule as part of [[West Florida]]. In 1819 the United States completed the purchase of West Florida and all of [[East Florida]] in the [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]], and in 1822 both were merged into the [[Florida Territory]].\n\n===United States territory===\n\n{{Main|Seminole Wars|Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty|Organic act#List of organic acts|Mississippi Territory}}\n\nAfter the [[American Revolution]] (1765\u201383), Britain ceded this area to the new United States of America. The [[Mississippi Territory]] was [[Territories of the United States|organized]] on April 7, 1798, from territory ceded by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]] to the United States. Their original colonial charters theoretically extended west to the Pacific Ocean. The Mississippi Territory was later twice expanded to include disputed territory claimed by both the United States and Spain.\n\nFrom 1800 to about 1830, the United States purchased some lands ([[Treaty of Doak's Stand]]) from Native American tribes for new settlements of European Americans; they were mostly migrants from other Southern states, particularly Virginia and North Carolina, where soils were exhausted.<ref>{{cite book|first=Ben |last=Wynne|title=Mississippi (On-The-Road Histories)|year=2007|page=12|isbn=978-1566566667}}</ref> On September 27, 1830, the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] was signed between the U.S. Government and the [[Choctaw]].

This opened up land for sale to [[European-American]] immigrant settlement. Article 14 in the treaty allowed those Choctaw who chose to remain in the state to become U.S. citizens, as they were considered to be giving up their tribal membership.

The forced migration of the Choctaw, together with other southeastern tribes removed as a result of the Act, became known as the [[Trail of Tears]].\n\nWhen [[King Cotton|cotton was king]] during the 1850s, Mississippi plantation owners\u2014especially those of the Delta and Black Belt central regions\u2014became wealthy due to the high fertility of the soil, the high price of cotton on the international market, and free labor gained through their holding enslaved African Americans. They used some of their profits to buy more cotton land and more slaves. The planters' dependence on hundreds of thousands of slaves for labor and the severe wealth imbalances among whites, played strong roles both in state politics and in planters' support for [[secession]]. Mississippi was a slave society, with the economy dependent on slavery. The state was thinly settled, with population concentrated in the riverfront areas and towns.\n\nBy 1860, the enslaved African-American population numbered 436,631 or 55% of the state's total of 791,305 persons.

The first six states to secede were those with the highest number of slaves. During the war, Union and Confederate forces struggled for dominance on the Mississippi River, critical to supply routes and commerce. More than 80,000 Mississippians fought in the [[Mississippi in the American Civil War|Civil War]], and casualties were extremely heavy. Union General [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s long siege of [[Vicksburg Campaign|Vicksburg]] finally gained the Union control of the river in 1863.\n\nIn the postwar period, [[freedmen]] withdrew from white-run churches to set up independent congregations. The majority of blacks left the Southern Baptist Church, sharply reducing its membership. They created independent black Baptist congregations. By 1895 they had established numerous black Baptist state associations and the [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] of black churches.<ref name=\"campbell\"/>\n\nIn addition, independent black denominations, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] (established in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] in the early 19th century) and the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] (established in New York City), sent [[missionaries]] to the South in the postwar years. They quickly attracted hundreds of thousands of converts and founded new churches across the South.

Some among the black delegates were [[freedmen]], but others were educated free blacks who had migrated from the North. The convention adopted universal suffrage; did away with property qualifications for [[suffrage]] or for office, a change that also benefited both blacks and poor whites; provided for the state's first public school system; forbade race distinctions in the possession and inheritance of property; and prohibited limiting civil rights in travel.<ref name=\"dubois\">{{cite book|first=W.

After the Civil War, tens of thousands of migrants were attracted to the area by higher wages offered by planters trying to develop land. In addition, black and white workers could earn money by clearing the land and selling timber, and eventually advance to ownership. The new farmers included many freedmen, who by the late 19th century achieved unusually high rates of land ownership in the Mississippi bottomlands. In the 1870s and 1880s, many black farmers succeeded in gaining land ownership.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, two-thirds of the Mississippi farmers who owned land in the Delta were [[African American]].<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/> But many had become overextended with debt during the falling cotton prices of the difficult years of the late 19th century. Cotton prices fell throughout the decades following the Civil War. As another agricultural depression lowered cotton prices into the 1890s, numerous African-American farmers finally had to sell their land to pay off debts, thus losing the land which they had developed by hard, personal labor.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nDemocrats had regained control of the state legislature in 1875, after a year of expanded violence against blacks and intimidation of whites in what was called the \"white line\" campaign, based on asserting [[white supremacy]]. Democratic whites were well armed and formed [[paramilitary]] organizations such as the [[Red Shirts (southern United States)|Red Shirts]] to suppress black voting. From 1874 to the elections of 1875, they pressured whites to join the Democrats, and conducted violence against blacks in at least 15 known \"riots\" in cities around the state to intimidate blacks. They killed a total of 150 blacks, although other estimates place the death toll at twice as many. A total of three white Republicans and five white Democrats were reported killed. In rural areas, deaths of blacks could be covered up. Riots (better described as massacres of blacks) took place in Vicksburg, Clinton, Macon, and in their counties, as well-armed whites broke up black meetings and [[lynching|lynched]] known black leaders, destroying local political organizations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wharton|first=V.

Together with imposition of [[Jim Crow]] and racial segregation laws, whites increased violence against blacks, lynching mostly men, through the period of the 1890s and extending to 1930. Cotton crops failed due to [[boll weevil]] infestation and successive severe flooding in 1912 and 1913, creating crisis conditions for many African Americans. With control of the ballot box and more access to credit, white planters bought out such farmers, expanding their ownership of Delta bottomlands. They also took advantage of new railroads sponsored by the state.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n[[File:All these children.jpg|thumb|Child workers, [[Pass Christian, Mississippi|Pass Christian]], 1911, by [[Lewis Hine]]]]\n\n===20th century to present===\n\nIn 1900, blacks made up more than half of the state's population. By 1910, a majority of black farmers in the Delta had lost their land and become [[sharecropper]]s. By 1920, the third generation after freedom, most African Americans in Mississippi were landless laborers again facing poverty.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/> Starting about 1913, tens of thousands of black Americans left Mississippi for the [[Northern United States|North]] in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to industrial cities such as [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Cleveland]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[New York City|New York]]. They sought jobs, better education for their children, the right to vote, relative freedom from discrimination, and better living. In the migration of 1910\u20131940, they left a society that had been steadily closing off opportunity. Most migrants from Mississippi took trains directly north to Chicago and often settled near former neighbors.\n\nBlacks also faced violence in the form of lynching, shooting, and the burning of churches. In 1923, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] stated \"the Negro feels that life is not safe in Mississippi and his life may be taken with impunity at any time upon the slightest pretext or provocation by a white man\".<ref>{{Cite web |url= http://digital.library.louisville.edu/cdm/ref/collection/leader/id/9763|title=The Louisville Leader.

The lack of jobs also drove some southern whites north to cities such as Chicago and Detroit, seeking employment, where they also competed with European immigrants. The state depended on agriculture, but mechanization put many farm laborers out of work.\n\nBy 1900, many white ministers, especially in the towns, subscribed to the [[Social Gospel]] movement, which attempted to apply Christian ethics to social and economic needs of the day.

The African-American call for social equality resonated throughout the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s and [[World War II]] in the 1940s.\n\nThe [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] from the South started in the 1940s, lasting until 1970. Almost half a million people left Mississippi in the second migration, three-quarters of them black. Nationwide during the first half of the 20th century, African Americans became rapidly urbanized and many worked in industrial jobs. The Second Great Migration included destinations in the [[Western United States|West]], especially [[California]], where the buildup of the defense industry offered higher paying jobs to both African Americans and whites.\n\nBlacks and whites in Mississippi generated rich, quintessentially American music traditions: [[gospel music]], [[country music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]] and [[rock and roll]]. All were invented, promulgated or heavily developed by Mississippi musicians, many of them African American, and most came from the [[Mississippi Delta]]. Many musicians carried their music north to Chicago, where they made it the heart of that city's jazz and blues.\n\nSo many African Americans left in the Great Migration that after the 1930s, they became a minority in Mississippi. In 1960 they made up 42% of the state's population.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1960 United States Census, University of Virginia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}, accessed March 13, 2008</ref> The whites maintained their discriminatory voter registration processes established in 1890, preventing most blacks from voting, even if they were well educated. Court challenges were not successful until later in the century. After World War II, African-American veterans returned with renewed commitment to be treated as full citizens of the United States and increasingly organized to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights.\n\nThe [[Civil Rights Movement]] had many roots in religion, and the strong community of churches helped supply volunteers and moral purpose for their activism. Mississippi was a center of activity, based in black churches, to educate and register black voters, and to work for integration. In 1954 the state had created the [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]], a tax-supported agency, chaired by the Governor, that claimed to work for the state's image but effectively spied on activists and passed information to the local White Citizens' Councils to suppress black activism. [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens Councils]] had been formed in many cities and towns to resist integration of schools following the unanimous 1954 [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling (''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'') that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. They used intimidation and economic blackmail against activists and suspected activists, including teachers and other professionals. Techniques included loss of jobs and eviction from rental housing.\n\nIn the summer of 1964 students and community organizers from across the country came to help register black voters in Mississippi and establish [[Freedom Schools]]. The [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] was established to challenge the all-white Democratic Party of the [[Solid South]]. Most white politicians resisted such changes. Chapters of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and its sympathizers used violence against activists, most notably the [[murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner]] in 1964 during the [[Freedom Summer]] campaign. This was a catalyst for Congressional passage the following year of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].

Registration of African-American voters increased and black candidates ran in the 1967 elections for state and local offices. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party fielded some candidates.

The total population has not increased significantly, but is young. Some of the above change in identification as mixed race is due to new births. But, it appears mostly to reflect those residents who have chosen to identify as more than one race, who in earlier years may have identified by just one ethnicity. A binary racial system had been in place since slavery times and the days of [[racial segregation]]. In the civil rights era, people of African descent banded together in an inclusive community to achieve political power and gain restoration of their civil rights.\n\nAs the demographer [[William H. Frey]] noted, \"In Mississippi, I think it's [identifying as mixed race] changed from within.\"<ref name=\"NYTrace\"/> Historically in Mississippi, after [[Indian removal]] in the 1830s, the major groups were designated as black (African American), who were then mostly enslaved, and white (primarily European American). [[Matthew Snipp]], also a demographer, commented on the increase in the 21st century in the number of people identifying as being of more than one race: \"In a sense, they're rendering a more accurate portrait of their racial heritage that in the past would have been suppressed.\"<ref name=\"NYTrace\"/>\n\nAfter having accounted for a majority of the state's population since well before the Civil War and through the 1930s, today [[African American]]s constitute approximately 37 percent of the state's population.

African Americans are the majority ethnic group in the northwestern [[Mississippi Delta|Yazoo Delta]], and the southwestern and the central parts of the state. These are areas where, historically, African Americans owned land as farmers in the 19th century following the Civil War, or worked on cotton plantations and farms.<ref>James C.

They educated their children privately. [[Industrialization]] did not reach many areas until the late 20th century. The planter [[aristocracy]], the elite of [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] Mississippi, kept the tax structure low for their own benefit, making only private improvements. Before the war the most successful planters, such as [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] President [[Jefferson Davis]], owned riverside properties along the Mississippi and Yazoo rivers in the Mississippi Delta. Away from the riverfronts, most of the Delta was undeveloped frontier.\n\nDuring the Civil War, 30,000 Mississippi soldiers, mostly white, died from wounds and disease, and many more were left crippled and wounded. Changes to the labor structure and an agricultural depression throughout the South caused severe losses in wealth. In 1860 assessed valuation of property in Mississippi had been more than $500&nbsp;million, of which $218&nbsp;million (43 percent) was estimated as the value of slaves. By 1870, total assets had decreased in value to roughly $177&nbsp;million.<ref>W. E. B. DuBois,''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860\u20131880''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1935; reprint New York: The Free Press, 1998, p. 432</ref>\n\nPoor whites and landless former slaves suffered the most from the postwar economic depression. The constitutional convention of early 1868 appointed a committee to recommend what was needed for relief of the state and its citizens. The committee found severe destitution among the laboring classes.<ref>Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', p. 437</ref> It took years for the state to rebuild levees damaged in battles. The upset of the commodity system impoverished the state after the war. By 1868 an increased cotton crop began to show possibilities for free labor in the state, but the crop of 565,000 bales produced in 1870 was still less than half of prewar figures.<ref>Du Bois (1935), ''Black Reconstruction'', pp. 432, 434</ref>\n\nBlacks cleared land, selling timber and developing bottomland to achieve ownership. In 1900, two-thirds of farm owners in Mississippi were blacks, a major achievement for them and their families. Due to the poor economy, low cotton prices and difficulty of getting credit, many of these farmers could not make it through the extended financial difficulties. Two decades later, the majority of African Americans were sharecroppers. The low prices of cotton into the 1890s meant that more than a generation of African Americans lost the result of their labor when they had to sell their farms to pay off accumulated debts.<ref name=\"Willis Forgotten Time\"/>\n\nAfter the Civil War, the state refused for years to build human capital by fully educating all its citizens. In addition, the reliance on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of cotton crops due to the devastation of the [[boll weevil]] in the early 20th century, devastating floods in 1912\u20131913 and 1927, collapse of cotton prices after 1920, and drought in 1930.<ref name=\"Solomon Final Frontiers\"/>\n\nIt was not until 1884, after the flood of 1882, that the state created the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta District Levee Board and started successfully achieving longer term plans for levees in the upper Delta.<ref name=\"about the levee\"/> Despite the state's building and reinforcing levees for years, the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] broke through and caused massive flooding of {{convert|27000|sqmi|km2}} throughout the Delta, homelessness for hundreds of thousands, and millions of dollars in property damages. With the Depression coming so soon after the flood, the state suffered badly during those years. In the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], hundreds of thousands of African Americans migrated North and West for jobs and chances to live as full citizens.\n\n===Entertainment and tourism===\n\nThe legislature's 1990 decision to legalize casino gambling along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast has led to increased revenues and economic gains for the state.

The first school for black students was not established until 1862.\n\nDuring Reconstruction in 1871, black and white Republicans drafted a constitution that was the first to provide for a system of free [[public education]] in the state. The state's dependence on agriculture and resistance to taxation limited the funds it had available to spend on any schools. In the early 20th century, there were still few schools in rural areas, particularly for black children. With seed money from the [[Julius Rosenwald]] Fund, many rural black communities across Mississippi raised matching funds and contributed public funds to build new schools for their children. Essentially, many black adults taxed themselves twice and made significant sacrifices to raise money for the education of children in their communities, in many cases donating land and/or labor to build such schools.<ref>James D.

In the majority-black Mississippi Delta counties, white parents worked through [[Citizens' Councils|White Citizens' Councils]] to set up private [[segregation academies]], where they enrolled their children. Often funding declined for the public schools.<ref name=\"bolton178\"/>\n\nBut in the state as a whole, only a small minority of white children were withdrawn from public schools. State officials believed they needed to maintain public education to attract new businesses. After several years of integration, whites often dominated local systems anyway, maintaining white supremacy. Many black parents complained that they had little representation in school administration, and that many of their former administrators and teachers had been pushed out. They have had to work to have their interests and children represented.<ref name=\"bolton178\">Bolton, Charles C.

Mississippi musicians created new forms by combining and creating variations on musical traditions from Africa with the musical traditions of white Southerners, a tradition largely rooted in Scots\u2013Irish music.\n\nThe state is creating a [[Mississippi Blues Trail]], with dedicated markers explaining historic sites significant to the history of blues music, such as [[Clarksdale, Mississippi|Clarksdale]]'s Riverside Hotel, where [[Bessie Smith]] died after her auto accident on [[U.S. Route 61|Highway 61]]. The Riverside Hotel is just one of many historical blues sites in Clarksdale. The [[Delta Blues Museum]] there is visited by tourists from all over the world. Close by is \"Ground Zero\", a contemporary blues club and restaurant co-owned by actor [[Morgan Freeman]].\n\n[[Elvis Presley]], who created a sensation in the 1950s as a crossover artist and contributed to rock 'n' roll, was a native of [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]]. From opera star [[Leontyne Price]] to the [[alternative rock]] band [[3 Doors Down]], to [[Gulf and western (music genre)|gulf and western]] singer [[Jimmy Buffett]], modern rock/jazz/world music guitarist-producer [[Clifton Hyde]], to rappers [[David Banner]], [[Big K.R.I.T.]] and [[Afroman]], Mississippi musicians have been significant in all genres.\n\n===Literature===\n\n{{Main|Mississippi literature}}\n\n===Sports===\n\n{{see also|List of college athletic programs in Mississippi}}\n[[File:Mississippi Braves Cody Johnson.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Mississippi Braves [[outfielder]] Cody Johnson at [[Trustmark Park]]]]\n*[[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] is home to the [[Biloxi Shuckers]] baseball team, a AA minor league affiliate of the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] and member of the [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] are currently located in Biloxi at [[MGM Park]]\n*[[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] is home to the [[Mississippi Brilla]], a [[USL League Two]] soccer team.\n*[[Pearl, Mississippi|Pearl]] is home to the [[Mississippi Braves]] baseball team.
