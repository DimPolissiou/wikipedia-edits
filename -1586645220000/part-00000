It is located on [[Holborn Viaduct]], almost opposite the [[Old Bailey]].  In medieval times it stood just outside (\"without\") the now-demolished old [[London Wall|city wall]], near the [[Newgate]]. It has been a [[Benefice|living]] of [[St John's College, Oxford]], since 1622 and is part of the area designated the \"Newgate Street Conservation Area\" (No.6) by the [[City of London Corporation]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Newgate Street Conservation Area [No. 6]|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/environment-and-planning/planning/heritage-and-design/conservation-areas/Pages/Newgate-Street-Conservation-Area.aspx|publisher=[[City of London Corporation]]}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe original [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] church on the site was dedicated to [[Edmund of East Anglia|St Edmund the King and Martyr]]. In 1137 it was given to the Priory of St Bartholomew. During the [[Crusades]] in the 12th century the church was renamed St Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, in reference to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], by soldiers who passed by the church on the way to the Holy Lands.<ref name=\"Newgate1999\">{{citeweb|title=NEWGATE: Conservation Area Character Summary|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/environment-and-planning/planning/heritage-and-design/conservation-areas/Documents/Newgate%20Street%20Character%20Summary.pdf|publisher=[[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]]|date=1999}}</ref> The name eventually became contracted to St Sepulchre.\n\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the City.

Modified in the 18th century, the church underwent extensive restoration in 1878. It narrowly avoided destruction in the [[Second World War]], although the 18th-century watch-house in its churchyard (erected to deter grave-robbers) was destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a [[coffered ceiling]]<ref>\"London:the City Churches\" Pevsner, N / Bradley, S New Haven, Yale, 1998 {{ISBN|0-300-09655-0}}</ref> installed in 1834.

The ashes of the conductor Sir [[Henry Wood]], C.H., founder of the [[Promenade Concerts]], who learnt to play the organ at the church as a boy, had been interred in the Chapel a decade earlier.

A Service of Thanksgiving for those named in the Book of Remembrance is held at the church each year as well as a Requiem close to [[All Souls' Day]]. Many concerts and memorial events for musicians have been held in the church over the years. In 2017 the Rector caused a storm in the media by ending the hiring scheme and excluding many choirs from singing and rehearsing in the church. A protest was held about this and many prominent musicians including [[John Rutter]] protested against the church decision. Attempts to mediate failed.\n\n===Military link===\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of [[the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)]] (merged to form the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.<ref>\"The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches\" Tucker,T: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 {{ISBN|0-9553945-0-3}}</ref> The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the [[City of London Rifles]] (the 6th Battalion [[London Regiment]]).

It is located on [[Holborn Viaduct]], almost opposite the [[Old Bailey]].  In medieval times it stood just outside (\"without\") the now-demolished old [[London Wall|city wall]], near the [[Newgate]]. It has been a [[Benefice|living]] of [[St John's College, Oxford]], since 1622 and is part of the area designated the \"Newgate Street Conservation Area\" (No.6) by the [[City of London Corporation]].<ref>{{citeweb|title=Newgate Street Conservation Area [No. 6]|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/environment-and-planning/planning/heritage-and-design/conservation-areas/Pages/Newgate-Street-Conservation-Area.aspx|publisher=[[City of London Corporation]]}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe original [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] church on the site was dedicated to [[Edmund of East Anglia|St Edmund the King and Martyr]]. In 1137 it was given to the Priory of St Bartholomew. During the [[Crusades]] in the 12th century the church was renamed St Edmund and the Holy Sepulchre, in reference to the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], by soldiers who passed by the church on the way to the Holy Lands.<ref name=\"Newgate1999\">{{citeweb|title=NEWGATE: Conservation Area Character Summary|url=https://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/services/environment-and-planning/planning/heritage-and-design/conservation-areas/Documents/Newgate%20Street%20Character%20Summary.pdf|publisher=[[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]]|date=1999}}</ref> The name eventually became contracted to St Sepulchre.\n\nThe church is today the largest parish church in the City.

It narrowly avoided destruction in the [[Second World War]], although the 18th-century watch-house in its churchyard (erected to deter grave-robbers) was destroyed and had to be rebuilt.\n\nThe interior of the church is a wide, roomy space with a [[coffered ceiling]]<ref>\"London:the City Churches\" Pevsner, N / Bradley, S New Haven, Yale, 1998 {{ISBN|0-300-09655-0}}</ref> installed in 1834.

The ashes of the conductor Sir [[Henry Wood]], C.H., founder of the [[Promenade Concerts]], who learnt to play the organ at the church as a boy, had been interred in the Chapel a decade earlier.

A Service of Thanksgiving for those named in the Book of Remembrance is held at the church each year as well as a Requiem close to [[All Souls' Day]]. Many concerts and memorial events for musicians have been held in the church over the years. In 2017 the Rector caused a storm in the media by ending the hiring scheme and excluding many choirs from singing and rehearsing in the church. A protest was held about this and many prominent musicians including [[John Rutter]] protested against the church decision. Attempts to mediate failed.\n\n===Military link===\nThe south aisle of the church holds the regimental chapel of [[the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment)]] (merged to form the [[Royal Regiment of Fusiliers]]), and its gardens are a memorial garden to that regiment.<ref>\"The Visitors Guide to the City of London Churches\" Tucker,T: London, Friends of the City Churches, 2006 {{ISBN|0-9553945-0-3}}</ref> The west end of the north aisle has various memorials connected with the [[City of London Rifles]] (the 6th Battalion [[London Regiment]]).

Since the 1998 Amendment of FCPA they also apply to foreign firms and persons who take any act in furtherance of such a corrupt payment while in the U.S. the meaning of foreign official is broad. For example, an owner of a bank who is also the minister of finance would count as a foreign official according to the U.S. government. Doctors at government-owned or managed hospitals are also considered to be foreign officials under the FCPA, as is anyone working for a government-owned or managed institution or enterprise. Employees of international organizations such as the United Nations are also considered to be foreign officials under the FCPA. A 2014 federal appellate court decision has provided guidance on how the term \"foreign official\" is defined under FCPA.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Michael V. Seitzinger|title=Eleventh Circuit Provides Guidance for the Definition of \"Foreign Official\" under the FCPA|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/fcpa.pdf|website=Legal Sidebar via Congressional Research Service|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=15 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nBecause the Act concerns the intent of the bribery rather than the amount, there is no requirement of [[materiality (law)|materiality]]. Offering anything of value as a bribe, whether cash or non-cash items, is prohibited.\n\nThe FCPA also requires companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to meet its accounting provisions.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|15|78m}}</ref> These accounting provisions operate in tandem with the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, and require respective corporations to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. An increasing number of corporations are taking additional steps to protect their reputation and reduce their exposure by employing the services of [[due diligence]] companies tasked with vetting third party intermediaries and identifying easily overlooked government officials embedded in otherwise privately held foreign firms. This strategy is one element of an effective FCPA Compliance Program, as it shows a sincere attempt to avoid business situations where high risk (prior history or proximity to unethical behavior) individuals are concerned.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nRegarding payments to foreign officials, the act draws a distinction between bribery and facilitation or \"grease payments\", which may be permissible under the FCPA, but may still violate local laws. The primary distinction is that grease payments or facilitation payments are made to an official to expedite his performance of the routine duties he is already bound to perform. The exception focuses on the purpose of the payment rather than on its value. Payments to foreign officials may be legal under the FCPA if the payments are permitted under the written laws of the host country. Certain payments or reimbursements relating to product promotion may also be permitted under the FCPA.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nA U.S. company acquiring a foreign firm could face successor liability for FCPA violations committed by the foreign firm prior to being acquired.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lawler|first1=William|last2=Phillips|first2=Anthony | title=Avoiding the Threat of FCPA Successor Liability|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/avoiding-threat-fcpa-successor-liability|publisher=Transaction Advisors |issn=2329-9134}}</ref> Generally, acquiring companies may be liable as a successor for pre-existing FCPA violations committed by an acquired company where those violations were subject to the FCPA's jurisdiction when committed.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sprinzen |first1=Nicole |last2=Hildebrand |first2=Jennifer |title=DOJ Clarifies Successor Liability for Foreign Acquisitions |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/doj-clarifies-successor-liability-foreign-acquisitions |publisher=Transaction Advisors |issn=2329-9134}}</ref> This position was further confirmed by the DOJ in a 2014 opinion stating that pre-acquisition conduct by a foreign target company without a jurisdictional nexus to the U.S. would not be subject to FCPA enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Alice|last2=Greenburg|first2=Douglas|last3=Sabin|first3=Barry|last4=Seltzer|first4=Nathan|last5=Su|first5=Jonathan|last6=Volkman|first6=Eric|last7=Chandler|first7=Kari|last8=Brown Jones|first8=Erin|title=DOJ Guidance Underscores Importance of Anti-corruption Due Diligence in International M&A |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/doj-guidance-underscores-importance-anti-corruption-due-diligence-international-ma|publisher=Transaction Advisors|issn=2329-9134}}</ref>\n\n===Anti-bribery/anti-corruption (ABAC) solutions===\n\nBusinesses increasingly focus on their [[Core competency|core competencies]], and as a result engage more third parties to provide critical business functions.

Companies that operate internationally, or that engage third parties in countries with a high [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], are especially at risk.  Many companies have now adopted \"anti-bribery/anti-corruption\" (ABAC) solutions to combat this risk and help protect themselves from fines and reputational damage.\n\nABAC compliance solutions are a subset of [[third party management]].

Since the 1998 Amendment of FCPA they also apply to foreign firms and persons who take any act in furtherance of such a corrupt payment while in the U.S. the meaning of foreign official is broad. For example, an owner of a bank who is also the minister of finance would count as a foreign official according to the U.S. government. Doctors at government-owned or managed hospitals are also considered to be foreign officials under the FCPA, as is anyone working for a government-owned or managed institution or enterprise. Employees of international organizations such as the United Nations are also considered to be foreign officials under the FCPA. A 2014 federal appellate court decision has provided guidance on how the term \"foreign official\" is defined under FCPA.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Michael V. Seitzinger|title=Eleventh Circuit Provides Guidance for the Definition of \"Foreign Official\" under the FCPA|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/fcpa.pdf|website=Legal Sidebar via Congressional Research Service|publisher=Federation of American Scientists|accessdate=23 February 2015|date=15 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nBecause the Act concerns the intent of the bribery rather than the amount, there is no requirement of [[materiality (law)|materiality]]. Offering anything of value as a bribe, whether cash or non-cash items, is prohibited.\n\nThe FCPA also requires companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to meet its accounting provisions.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|15|78m}}</ref> These accounting provisions operate in tandem with the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA, and require respective corporations to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. An increasing number of corporations are taking additional steps to protect their reputation and reduce their exposure by employing the services of [[due diligence]] companies tasked with vetting third party intermediaries and identifying easily overlooked government officials embedded in otherwise privately held foreign firms. This strategy is one element of an effective FCPA Compliance Program, as it shows a sincere attempt to avoid business situations where high risk (prior history or proximity to unethical behavior) individuals are concerned.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nRegarding payments to foreign officials, the act draws a distinction between bribery and facilitation or \"grease payments\", which may be permissible under the FCPA, but may still violate local laws. The primary distinction is that grease payments or facilitation payments are made to an official to expedite his performance of the routine duties he is already bound to perform. The exception focuses on the purpose of the payment rather than on its value. Payments to foreign officials may be legal under the FCPA if the payments are permitted under the written laws of the host country. Certain payments or reimbursements relating to product promotion may also be permitted under the FCPA.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nA U.S. company acquiring a foreign firm could face successor liability for FCPA violations committed by the foreign firm prior to being acquired.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lawler|first1=William|last2=Phillips|first2=Anthony | title=Avoiding the Threat of FCPA Successor Liability|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/avoiding-threat-fcpa-successor-liability|publisher=Transaction Advisors |issn=2329-9134}}</ref> Generally, acquiring companies may be liable as a successor for pre-existing FCPA violations committed by an acquired company where those violations were subject to the FCPA's jurisdiction when committed.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sprinzen |first1=Nicole |last2=Hildebrand |first2=Jennifer |title=DOJ Clarifies Successor Liability for Foreign Acquisitions |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/doj-clarifies-successor-liability-foreign-acquisitions |publisher=Transaction Advisors |issn=2329-9134}}</ref> This position was further confirmed by the DOJ in a 2014 opinion stating that pre-acquisition conduct by a foreign target company without a jurisdictional nexus to the U.S. would not be subject to FCPA enforcement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=Alice|last2=Greenburg|first2=Douglas|last3=Sabin|first3=Barry|last4=Seltzer|first4=Nathan|last5=Su|first5=Jonathan|last6=Volkman|first6=Eric|last7=Chandler|first7=Kari|last8=Brown Jones|first8=Erin|title=DOJ Guidance Underscores Importance of Anti-corruption Due Diligence in International M&A |url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/doj-guidance-underscores-importance-anti-corruption-due-diligence-international-ma|publisher=Transaction Advisors|issn=2329-9134}}</ref>\n\n===Anti-bribery/anti-corruption (ABAC) solutions===\n\nBusinesses increasingly focus on their [[Core competency|core competencies]], and as a result engage more third parties to provide critical business functions.

Companies that operate internationally, or that engage third parties in countries with a high [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], are especially at risk.  Many companies have now adopted \"anti-bribery/anti-corruption\" (ABAC) solutions to combat this risk and help protect themselves from fines and reputational damage.\n\nABAC compliance solutions are a subset of [[third party management]].

Founded in 1995, the team plays in [[USL League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[American Soccer Pyramid]].\n\nThe club plays its home games at Gurski Stadium on the campus of [[Wilson High School (Spring Township, Pennsylvania)|Wilson High School]]. The club's colors are white, black, gold, and navy blue. United formerly fielded a team in the [[Super-20 League]], a league for players seventeen to twenty years of age under the [[United Soccer Leagues]] umbrella.\n\nPrior to the 2010 season, the team was known as the '''Reading Rage'''. On December 21, 2009, the Rage organization announced its agreement with [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Philadelphia Union]] to become their official minor league affiliate, and re-branded as Reading United A.C. with immediate effect.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/389250.html |title=New era for Reading PDL team |publisher=Uslsoccer.com |date=December 21, 2009 |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006165210/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/389250.html |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nReading United is one of only three teams in [[USL League Two]] history to reach consecutive league finals - reaching in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe team has had a great deal of success promoting amateur players to the professional ranks, with over 130 former players having gone on to either play professionally, cap for their country in international play, or be drafted by an MLS team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.readingunitedac.com/alumni|title=Reading United Alumni|website=www.readingunitedac.com|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Reading-American Soccer Club was established in the early 1900s under the name of Germania Soccer Club by a group of German immigrant soccer players and soccer enthusiasts. On April 26, 1926 Germania merged with the Reading Liederkranz (Reading's German-American club), and the Sport Club legally became the Sports Division of the Reading Liederkranz.\n\nLater, under the direction of Germania and Liederkranz members Werner Kraheck and Peter Weiss, the Reading Berks Junior Soccer League was born, providing a foundation for local youth soccer clubs to flourish. The Germania teams were the precursor to the now common \u201cpremier\u201d teams. After the Germania program ended in the late 1970s/early 1980s, the premier teams became the Reading Berks Select program whereby each club could send several of their \u201ctop players\u201d to participate in tournaments and training but then return them to their club teams. After several iterations, the Reading Berks Select teams became known as Reading Berks United, later RBU, and finally Berks Soccer Academy aka B.S.A. Rage.\n\nMany people in the greater Reading area are surprised to learn that the Reading United A.C. (formerly Reading Rage) is the 2nd longest tenured minor league team in the area (behind the R-Phils). Berks Professional Sports introduced the Reading Rage minor league team 15 years ago with a squad that featured a great blend of local talent and \u201cimported\u201d stars. The Reading Rage would not have begun without the efforts of former Penn State All-American Archie Moylan. Archie was playing professional soccer and featured as a player and General Manager for the Philadelphia Freedom. Archie worked tirelessly to recruit an ownership team and staff. In 1996 his dream took the field. While a lot of the players, staff and even owners of the original team moved on, Archie's dream stayed alive. The Rage teams of the 1990s did well, with Archie leading the team to the playoffs in their 2nd season, and capturing a D3 Pro League (precursor to today's USL2) Mid-Atlantic Division Crown in 1997. Archie Moylan continued to build the Rage brand, and the team was rewarded for his management efforts by being named Franchise of the Year. In 1998 Archie further expanded his roles as he took over as head coach of the 3rd year program. The Rage teams of the 1990s featured a lot of local talent including former Wilson H.S. stars Ed Sep, Matt Wolf, Chris Arthur, and Drew Kauffman; Weiser stars Tom Auchenbach and Steve Thomas; and of course Fleetwood greats Keith Schlegel and former US Men's National Team member Troy Snyder. The team played at Fleetwood H.S. for two years prior to transitioning to Central Catholic Stadium in St. Lawrence, where they played for a number of years before moving to Albright College and finally at Exeter's Don Thomas Stadium.\n\nTragically, Archie was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2000. In recognition of Archie's efforts and accomplishments, the United Soccer Leagues has established The Archie Moylan Award to honor a member of the USL family who has exhibited outstanding humanitarian qualities or overcome extraordinary adversity in hopes to give back to the soccer community through their actions and deeds.  Past winners include executive Marcie Laumann with the Hampton Roads Piranhas (W-League), player Todd Elkins for the Southern California Seahorses (PDL), and player, coach, and USL staff member, Stuart Bracher.  Each of these individuals has exemplified the ability to not only overcome adversity but transform it into an opportunity to effectuate positive change by serving as an inspiration to others. This year's honoree was Betsy McAdams. McAdams died in June of brain cancer. She was an original employee of the Charleston Battery since its inception in 1993 and went on to serve in a number of roles including Director of Operations and Director of Finance & Business Administration. She was named Chief Operating Officer in May 2008. USL renamed the Key Grip Award to the Betsy McAdams award because she defined the behind the scenes employee.\n\nDue to the loss of Archie, a string of losing years, and decreasing fan attendance, in 2004 the team transitioned from the Pro Soccer League (USL2) to the rapidly growing PDL. The pro-am PDL allowed focus on younger players and generally less overhead and costs for franchise operations. After some internal shuffling and under the stewardship of owner and general manager Jerry Wojton, the team regained in strength, with Jerry eventually landing seasoned English Club Crystal Palace's Academy Director Derek Broadley to coach the team in 2005. Derek brought his passion for player development and quickly reignited local interest in the team and league with his attractive style of play and confidence in his coaching methodologies. While Derek's team's hovered around .500, he returned the Rage teams to the winning side of things, posting a 7\u20135\u20134 2007 record. One of the players Derek introduced to the Reading Rage in 2007 was a central defender from Boston College, Brendan Burke. Derek left the Reading Rage in the fall of 2007 to take over the Bermuda National team position.\n\nOn January 13, 2011, Reading United saw four former players, including three from the 2010 roster, drafted at the [[2011 MLS SuperDraft]] in Baltimore, Maryland.  2011 MLS Rookie of the Year [[C. J. Sapong]] was selected 10th overall by [[Sporting Kansas City]], followed by [[Corey Hertzog]] who was selected 13th overall by [[New York Red Bulls]].  [[Levi Houapeu]] was selected in the third round by [[Philadelphia Union]] with the 41st pick overall.  Former Reading Rage player, [[Zarek Valentin]], was selected 4th overall by [[Chivas USA]].\n\nIn 2012, three more alumni were selected in the [[2012 MLS SuperDraft]], held in Kansas City, MO.  [[Andrew Wenger]] became the United's first alumnus to be selected with the #1 overall pick by the [[Montreal Impact]].  Defender [[Matt Hedges]] was selected soon after by [[FC Dallas]] with the #11 overall pick.  For the second straight year, the [[Philadelphia Union]] picked a United alum, picking [[Raymon Gaddis]] in the 2nd round of the draft. Probable [[Generation Adidas]] signings [[Billy Schuler]] and [[Brian Span|Brian \"Cobi\" Span]] were likely first round picks, but chose to sign overseas rather than enter the MLS SuperDraft.\n\nFour other former players were also selected during the [[2012 MLS Supplemental Draft]], including [[Dawyne Smith]] (#3 by the [[New England Revolution]]), [[Brian Ownby]] (#7 by the [[Houston Dynamo]]), [[Evans Frimpong]] (#9 by the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]), and [[Christian Barreiro]] (#50 by the [[New York Red Bulls]]).\n\nJust over a week after the Supplemental Draft (January 25, 2012), former keeper [[Jeremy Vuolo]] signed a professional contract with the [[New York Red Bulls]], after spending his first professional season abroad with [[Finland]]'s [[AC Oulu]].\n\nOn December 28, 2013, Reading United announced that David Castellanos was chosen as the club's head coach for the 2014 season.\n\n==Name, colors, and badge==\nThe primary colors of Reading United A.C. are black, gold, and navy blue. The black and gold derive from Reading's civic seal and to the colors of the Germania Liederkranz, one of the area's original soccer clubs. Navy and gold represent the traditional state colors of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe logo for Reading United A.C. includes a stylized train that alludes to the famous [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]], which was one of the first railroads in the United States. The train depiction contains a soccer ball encircled by 11 bolts, symbolizing the 11 players on a soccer field. The shamrocks are a tribute to an [[Irish people|Irishman]] named Paul \"Archie\" Moylan, the Reading Rage's former team captain, general manager, and coach, who died of cancer in 2000. \n\nThe secondary logo features a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]], a symbol used officially by the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] alluding to its colonial designation as the \"Keystone State.\"\n\n\"United\" is a common [[Football club names|soccer appellation]] used in the [[British Isles]] and represents its relationship to the Philadelphia Union. The initials A.C. stand for \"Athletic Club\", which indicates the team's goal of expanding its business to incorporate other sports and fitness programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readingunitedac.com/name-logo-and-colors.html |title=Reading United A.C.

Founded in 1995, the team plays in [[USL League Two]], the fourth tier of the [[American Soccer Pyramid]].\n\nThe club plays its home games at Gurski Stadium on the campus of [[Wilson High School (Spring Township, Pennsylvania)|Wilson High School]]. The club's colors are white, black, gold, and navy blue. United formerly fielded a team in the [[Super-20 League]], a league for players seventeen to twenty years of age under the [[United Soccer Leagues]] umbrella.\n\nPrior to the 2010 season, the team was known as the '''Reading Rage'''. On December 21, 2009, the Rage organization announced its agreement with [[Major League Soccer]]'s [[Philadelphia Union]] to become their official minor league affiliate, and re-branded as Reading United A.C. with immediate effect.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/389250.html |title=New era for Reading PDL team |publisher=Uslsoccer.com |date=December 21, 2009 |accessdate=January 31, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006165210/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/389250.html |archivedate=October 6, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nReading United is one of only three teams in [[USL League Two]] history to reach consecutive league finals - reaching in 2018 and 2019.\n\nThe team has had a great deal of success promoting amateur players to the professional ranks, with over 130 former players having gone on to either play professionally, cap for their country in international play, or be drafted by an MLS team.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.readingunitedac.com/alumni|title=Reading United Alumni|website=www.readingunitedac.com|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe Reading-American Soccer Club was established in the early 1900s under the name of Germania Soccer Club by a group of German immigrant soccer players and soccer enthusiasts. On April 26, 1926 Germania merged with the Reading Liederkranz (Reading's German-American club), and the Sport Club legally became the Sports Division of the Reading Liederkranz.\n\nLater, under the direction of Germania and Liederkranz members Werner Kraheck and Peter Weiss, the Reading Berks Junior Soccer League was born, providing a foundation for local youth soccer clubs to flourish. The Germania teams were the precursor to the now common \u201cpremier\u201d teams. After the Germania program ended in the late 1970s/early 1980s, the premier teams became the Reading Berks Select program whereby each club could send several of their \u201ctop players\u201d to participate in tournaments and training but then return them to their club teams. After several iterations, the Reading Berks Select teams became known as Reading Berks United, later RBU, and finally Berks Soccer Academy aka B.S.A. Rage.\n\nMany people in the greater Reading area are surprised to learn that the Reading United A.C. (formerly Reading Rage) is the 2nd longest tenured minor league team in the area (behind the R-Phils). Berks Professional Sports introduced the Reading Rage minor league team 15 years ago with a squad that featured a great blend of local talent and \u201cimported\u201d stars. The Reading Rage would not have begun without the efforts of former Penn State All-American Archie Moylan. Archie was playing professional soccer and featured as a player and General Manager for the Philadelphia Freedom. Archie worked tirelessly to recruit an ownership team and staff. In 1996 his dream took the field. While a lot of the players, staff and even owners of the original team moved on, Archie's dream stayed alive. The Rage teams of the 90's did well, with Archie leading the team to the playoffs in their 2nd season, and capturing a D3 Pro League (precursor to today's USL2) Mid-Atlantic Division Crown in 1997. Archie Moylan continued to build the Rage brand, and the team was rewarded for his management efforts by being named Franchise of the Year. In 1998 Archie further expanded his roles as he took over as head coach of the 3rd year program. The Rage teams of the 90's featured a lot of local talent including former Wilson H.S. stars Ed Sep, Matt Wolf, Chris Arthur, and Drew Kauffman; Weiser stars Tom Auchenbach and Steve Thomas; and of course Fleetwood greats Keith Schlegel and former US Men's National Team member Troy Snyder. The team played at Fleetwood H.S. for two years prior to transitioning to Central Catholic Stadium in St. Lawrence, where they played for a number of years before moving to Albright College and finally at Exeter's Don Thomas Stadium.\n\nTragically, Archie was diagnosed with cancer and died in 2000. In recognition of Archie's efforts and accomplishments, the United Soccer Leagues has established The Archie Moylan Award to honor a member of the USL family who has exhibited outstanding humanitarian qualities or overcome extraordinary adversity in hopes to give back to the soccer community through their actions and deeds.  Past winners include executive Marcie Laumann with the Hampton Roads Piranhas (W-League), player Todd Elkins for the Southern California Seahorses (PDL), and player, coach, and USL staff member, Stuart Bracher.  Each of these individuals has exemplified the ability to not only overcome adversity but transform it into an opportunity to effectuate positive change by serving as an inspiration to others. This year's honoree was Betsy McAdams. McAdams died in June of brain cancer. She was an original employee of the Charleston Battery since its inception in 1993 and went on to serve in a number of roles including Director of Operations and Director of Finance & Business Administration. She was named Chief Operating Officer in May 2008. USL renamed the Key Grip Award to the Betsy McAdams award because she defined the behind the scenes employee.\n\nDue to the loss of Archie, a string of losing years, and decreasing fan attendance, in 2004 the team transitioned from the Pro Soccer League (USL2) to the rapidly growing PDL. The pro-am PDL allowed focus on younger players and generally less overhead and costs for franchise operations. After some internal shuffling and under the stewardship of owner and general manager Jerry Wojton, the team regained in strength, with Jerry eventually landing seasoned English Club Crystal Palace's Academy Director Derek Broadley to coach the team in 2005. Derek brought his passion for player development and quickly reignited local interest in the team and league with his attractive style of play and confidence in his coaching methodologies. While Derek's team's hovered around .500, he returned the Rage teams to the winning side of things, posting a 7\u20135\u20134 2007 record. One of the players Derek introduced to the Reading Rage in 2007 was a central defender from Boston College, Brendan Burke. Derek left the Reading Rage in the fall of 2007 to take over the Bermuda National team position.\n\nOn January 13, 2011, Reading United saw four former players, including three from the 2010 roster, drafted at the [[2011 MLS SuperDraft]] in Baltimore, Maryland.  2011 MLS Rookie of the Year [[C. J. Sapong]] was selected 10th overall by [[Sporting Kansas City]], followed by [[Corey Hertzog]] who was selected 13th overall by [[New York Red Bulls]].  [[Levi Houapeu]] was selected in the third round by [[Philadelphia Union]] with the 41st pick overall.  Former Reading Rage player, [[Zarek Valentin]], was selected 4th overall by [[Chivas USA]].\n\nIn 2012, three more alumni were selected in the [[2012 MLS SuperDraft]], held in Kansas City, MO.  [[Andrew Wenger]] became the United's first alumnus to be selected with the #1 overall pick by the [[Montreal Impact]].  Defender [[Matt Hedges]] was selected soon after by [[FC Dallas]] with the #11 overall pick.  For the second straight year, the [[Philadelphia Union]] picked a United alum, picking [[Raymon Gaddis]] in the 2nd round of the draft. Probable [[Generation Adidas]] signings [[Billy Schuler]] and [[Brian Span|Brian \"Cobi\" Span]] were likely first round picks, but chose to sign overseas rather than enter the MLS SuperDraft.\n\nFour other former players were also selected during the [[2012 MLS Supplemental Draft]], including [[Dawyne Smith]] (#3 by the [[New England Revolution]]), [[Brian Ownby]] (#7 by the [[Houston Dynamo]]), [[Evans Frimpong]] (#9 by the [[Chicago Fire Soccer Club|Chicago Fire]]), and [[Christian Barreiro]] (#50 by the [[New York Red Bulls]]).\n\nJust over a week after the Supplemental Draft (January 25, 2012), former keeper [[Jeremy Vuolo]] signed a professional contract with the [[New York Red Bulls]], after spending his first professional season abroad with [[Finland]]'s [[AC Oulu]].\n\nOn December 28, 2013, Reading United announced that David Castellanos was chosen as the club's head coach for the 2014 season.\n\n==Name, colors, and badge==\nThe primary colors of Reading United A.C. are black, gold, and navy blue. The black and gold derive from Reading's civic seal and to the colors of the Germania Liederkranz, one of the area's original soccer clubs. Navy and gold represent the traditional state colors of Pennsylvania.\n\nThe logo for Reading United A.C. includes a stylized train that alludes to the famous [[Reading Company|Reading Railroad]], which was one of the first railroads in the United States. The train depiction contains a soccer ball encircled by 11 bolts, symbolizing the 11 players on a soccer field. The shamrocks are a tribute to an [[Irish people|Irishman]] named Paul \"Archie\" Moylan, the Reading Rage's former team captain, general manager, and coach, who died of cancer in 2000. \n\nThe secondary logo features a [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]], a symbol used officially by the Commonwealth of [[Pennsylvania]] alluding to its colonial designation as the \"Keystone State.\"\n\n\"United\" is a common [[Football club names|soccer appellation]] used in the [[British Isles]] and represents its relationship to the Philadelphia Union. The initials A.C. stand for \"Athletic Club\", which indicates the team's goal of expanding its business to incorporate other sports and fitness programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readingunitedac.com/name-logo-and-colors.html |title=Reading United A.C.

It was written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by Carl Tibbetts, and first aired on [[Channel 4]] on 16 December 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yoshida|first1=Emily|title=Here's the first promo for the Black Mirror Christmas Special|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/4/7333243/first-promo-black-mirror-christmas-special-white-christmas-jon-hamm-charlie-brooker|accessdate=5 December 2014|work=The Verge|date=5 December 2014}}</ref> The only television special of the series, it was also the last episode to be aired on Channel 4, as the series would move to [[Netflix]] for its third season.\n\nThe episode starts with two men, Matt ([[Jon Hamm]]) and Joe ([[Rafe Spall]]), stationed at a remote outpost in the middle of a snowy wilderness. As they tell each other their respective lives to pass the time, those events are [[Story within a story|depicted on-screen]], forming three mini-stories ultimately relating to the characters' current situation.<ref name=sunopxmas>{{cite news|title=Jon Hamm in Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror special - first pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a612187/jon-hamm-in-charlie-brookers-black-mirror-special-first-pictures.html#~oWzCSOMCaoS11U|accessdate=24 November 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=24 November 2014}}</ref> [[Oona Chaplin]] and [[Natalia Tena]] co-star as two characters in these stories.\n\nThe episode received very positive reviews, with praise for the performances of Hamm and Spall, the writing, and the [[plot twist|twist ending]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[MOS:TVPLOT]], the plot summary needs to be 400 words or less. -->\nJoe Potter (Spall) awakens in a cabin on a snowy Christmas Day, greeted by Matt Trent (Hamm). The two have lived there for five years but barely spoken. To get Joe to open up, Matt explains why he ended up in the cabin. He used to run an online group who watched each other seduce women, through \"Z-Eyes\" which record vision and hearing. One member, Harry (Hardiker), crashed an office Christmas party and talked to Jennifer (Tena). She was mentally ill, heard voices and mistook his Z-Eyes communication for him doing so too. After they returned to her place, she poisoned them both in a [[murder-suicide]].\n\nMatt also talks about his job, training \"cookies\" of people\u2014digital clones stored in an egg-shaped object\u2014as personal assistants. He describes the experience of Greta's (Chaplin) cookie, who refused to be a personal assistant. Matt fast-forwarded time inside the cookie's world for six months, and she relented under the threat of further boredom and isolation.\n\nJoe reluctantly talks. He was \"blocked\" by his fianc\u00e9e Beth (Montgomery) after the two fought over her decision to have an abortion. Blocking causes them to see each other and their offspring as grey silhouettes and prevents Joe from contacting Beth. Months later, Joe tried to confront her still-pregnant silhouette, leading to legal enforcement of the block. Each Christmas Eve, Joe travelled to Beth's father's house to spy on the little girl. The block was removed when Beth died in a train accident, which allowed Joe to discover that Beth had an affair and he was not the child's father. In a distressed confrontation with Beth's father, Joe struck him with a snow globe, killing him, and left. The girl found her grandfather and set off into the snowy wilderness to get help, only to freeze to death.\n\nWhile telling the story, the cabin gradually transforms into Beth's father's house. Joe and Matt are in a cookie, the five years having been a result of altered perception of time, and Joe's cookie has given testimony which can be used to convict Joe. In exchange for extracting the confession, Matt avoids imprisonment for his role in Harry's death, but he is now convicted as a [[sex offender]] and is permanently blocked by everyone. Meanwhile, an officer sets Joe's cookie to experience time at 1,000 years per minute, with the song \"[[I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday]]\"\u2014which played as he killed Beth's father\u2014on repeat.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Jon Hamm]] as Matt, a former dating coach who uses psychological manipulation to pull a murder confession from Joe Potter, in exchange for leniency in his own legal battle surrounding the death of one of his clients.\n* [[Rafe Spall]] as Joe, a man traumatized by emotional abuse he suffered by being separated from whom he believed to be his daughter and, in a fit of emotional distress, commits murder.\n* [[Oona Chaplin]] as Greta, a sentient digital clone who is made to serve her human or face an eternity of isolation.\n* [[Rasmus Hardiker]] as Harry, an insecure young man who utilizes Matt's services as a dating coach and is ultimately murdered by his romantic interest, Jennifer.\n* [[Natalia Tena]] as Jennifer, a psychotic woman who kills herself and her fellow party-goer, Harry.\n* [[Janet Montgomery]] as Bethany, Joe's fiancee who is unfaithful to him, resulting in her pregnancy.\n* Dan Li as Tim, Bethany's co-worker and lover.\n* [[Zahra Ahmadi]] as Gita, Beth's co-worker and Tim's girlfriend.\n* [[Robin Weaver]] as Detective Holder, a police officer charged with the task of soliciting a confession from Joe for his role in the deaths of Bethany's father, Gordon, and daughter, May.\n* Ken Drury as Gordon, Bethany's father and custodial guardian of his granddaughter, May.\n* [[Verity Marshall]] as Amy, a fellow party-goer at the company event where Harry meets Jennifer.\n* [[Esther Smith]] as Madge\n* Ian Keir Attard as Dawson\n\n==Production==\nFollowing the second series of ''Black Mirror'', [[Channel 4]] agreed on a third series of four episodes on the condition that detailed synopses of episodes were given. After presenting some ideas to the channel, series creator [[Charlie Brooker]] and executive producer Annabel Jones were told that they \"weren't very ''Black Mirror''\", leaving the show in a limbo situation. A year later, Brooker and Jones were able to negotiate a 90-minute Christmas special, \"White Christmas\". The episode incorporated one of the ideas they pitched, \"Angel of the Morning\", which became the dating storyline with Matt, Harry and Jennifer.<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>{{rp|102\u2013103}} \"White Christmas\" was the last ''Black Mirror'' episode produced under Channel 4; following this, the series moved to [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|126\u2013127}} It aired on 16 December 2014 in the United Kingdom.\n\n===Writing and casting===\nThe episode was written by Brooker. It was directed by Carl Tibbetts, who had previously directed series two episode \"[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|77}} When Tibbetts was hired, Brooker and Jones had four or five concepts for the series. Inspirations for the episode, which is a portmanteau of three stories, include the 1945 horror film ''[[Dead of Night]]''<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106}} and the 1983 science fiction film ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'',<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|103}} both of which are anthologies. The setting of a spaceship was briefly considered.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106}}\n\nThe episode's stories introduce two new technologies, which are both important to the ending. The Z-Eyes allows the user to stream video from their eyes and to block people from their vision. The other technology is a duplicate of a person's consciousness, stored in a small egg-shaped cookie. Unprecedented for the show, \"White Christmas\" reuses technology from another episode: after several designs for the Z-Eyes, it was decided that the device from series one episode \"[[The Entire History of You]]\" should be used.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106}}\n\nIn the first draft, Trent's character was cheerful and [[cockney]] to contrast with Joe.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|107}} In mid-2014, [[Jon Hamm]] wanted to meet with Brooker, having enjoyed previous series of the programme. Following this, he was offered a part as Trent.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|107}} Whilst the original version had Trent be slightly grating, Hamm was keen for his character to be likeable and affable as a contrast to his odious actions.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|112}}\n\nJoe is played by [[Rafe Spall]], who had previously read a script for another ''Black Mirror'' episode.<ref name=premds>{{cite news|title=Black Mirror: Charlie Brooker, Jon Hamm on the dark side of Yuletide|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/interviews/a616435/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-jon-hamm-on-the-dark-side-of-yuletide|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=Digital Spy|date=14 December 2014}}</ref> The episode opens with Joe and the viewer first sees Trent through Joe's eyes. He is initially very quiet and not able to recall precisely why he is in the cabin. Every time the cabin is shown, some details are changed until it becomes the house in which Joe commits the murder. The cooker, work surface, fireplace and clock are some of these details. Additionally, at one point Joe hears a noise which is his cell sliding shut as someone checks on him.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|112\u2013113}}\n\nThe first story about dating featured Trent, Harry and Jennifer. It was inspired by Brooker's observations of people on the street using [[Bluetooth]] headsets for calls, who looked like they were talking to themselves \"as if they had a mental illness\". The horse anecdote was inspired by Brooker reading \"bullshit ice-breakers\" used by [[pickup artist]]s.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|115}}\n\n[[Oona Chaplin]] was cast as Greta, roughly two days before filming, when Chaplin was working in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|117}} The second story, where Matt sets up Greta's cookie, was inspired by the comedic idea of someone who \"put a consciousness into a toaster\", and the toaster then falls in love with them. Brooker had considered this idea for a while, and realised it was a \"fucking nightmare\" rather than a love story. One draft of the story showed Greta's cookie watching Greta play with her kids, realising that she would never be able to hug her children again. This scene was rejected as \"too weird and nasty\" for the episode, but later used in series four episode \"[[Black Museum (Black Mirror)|Black Museum]]\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|117}}\n\nThe third story is about Joe and his girlfriend Beth. It was based on an idea from Brooker's 2001 series ''[[Unnovations]]'' in which a pair of glasses showed homeless people as cartoon characters. With the invention of [[Google Glass]], this looked more possible in reality. The idea of blocking on social media was also considered. The ending takes inspiration from [[Stephen King]]'s 1981 short story \"[[The Jaunt]]\" and the 1982 series finale of ''[[Sapphire & Steel]]''.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|118}} Similar to \"White Bear\", Joe is a character who is tortured after committing a crime.\n\n===Filming, music and editing===\nFor the setting, a slightly futuristic [[London]] and a world in which the characters lived on boats were both considered. However, the episode had a very limited budget. Filming took place in four corners of London within a short period of time, which posed a challenge. Sets were built at [[Twickenham]], which would be used during production of later series.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106\u2013107}} The cabin was designed to look timeless, with Trent's outfit looking cleaner than the environment, while Joe's is warm.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|113}} The episode was shot in October, during a period when Hamm and Spall both had heavy colds.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|112}}\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Jon Opstad. The colour palettes, costumes and soundtrack of the three stories are designed to be similar to each other, to give the episode an overarching identity. The first story has monochrome tones and a \"lopsided weirdness\" to its soundtrack; Jennifer's dress is made of navy leather and mesh to signify her role as a dominatrix.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|115}}\n\nJetlagged, Chaplin fell asleep during some of her early scenes, which required her to lie down on an operating table. Greta wears an outfit similar to a [[kimono]], to indicate her \"[[Zen]]-like existence\", while her cookie wears a [[neoprene]] fabric. The score for the second story is \"crisp, clean [and] sterile\", using digital synths to contrast with the rest of the soundtrack.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|117}} The third story changes \"from romance to tragedy\", so its score incorporates a [[viola]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|118}} A scene where Beth struggles to get a vomiting Joe into a taxi was cut from filming due to time constraints.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nThe ending shows Joe smashing the radio repeatedly, as it reappears each time. It was decided on the day that this should be filmed in one continuous take, with stagehands quickly replacing the radio on the table; this was difficult due to their limited supply of radios. A shot of Joe smashing the snow globe, only for it to reappear, was cut. During filming, Brooker had an idea for the closing moments, which show the camera continually panning out from the cabin to show it inside a snow globe. The effect used lots of different [[take]]s as well as visual effects.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|120}} Editing took place up to the day of its press screening at Channel 4, leading Brooker to delay work on his ''[[2014 Wipe]]''.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|123}}\n\n==Analysis==\nThematically, the episode addresses the topic of punishment and of whether [[artificial intelligence]] can be \"a form of life\". It also has commentary on [[cyberstalking]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nBoth Joe and Trent are unreliable narrators. Brooker commented that the viewer quickly loses sympathy for Joe in the third story, as he is obnoxious towards Beth and is hinted to have an issue with alcohol. Joe is \"possessive and has an explosive temper\" and Brooker believes him to be the \"root cause\" of the issues in his and Beth's relationship. Brooker commented of Joe deserving his punishment, \"he did and he didn't\", and says that viewers may find Trent's punishment harsh because he is charming. Hamm opined that Trent deserved punishment but should have a path to redemption.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nBrooker thought the episode may have been the last for the programme, so he included [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] which referred to previous episodes.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106}} In the beginning of the scene in which Matt's computer shows dating club clients in the conference call, one of the users has the nickname, \"I_AM_WALDO\", and another, \"Pie Ape\". The Z-Eyes are reminiscent of a similar device in \"[[The Entire History of You]]\". Clips of TV shows from \"[[The Waldo Moment]]\" and \"[[Fifteen Million Merits]]\" are visible when Joe flicks through the TV channels. The pregnancy test Joe finds is the same one used in \"[[Be Right Back]]\". The [[News ticker|ticker]] during a news report mentions the prime minister from \"[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]\", as well as Victoria Skillane from \"[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]\", and Liam Monroe from \"The Waldo Moment\". Bethany sings \"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is\", the same song that Abi sings in \"Fifteen Million Merits\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://observer.com/2014/12/cookies-arent-grains-debunking-the-single-universe-theory-of-black-mirror/ | first=Drew | last=Grant | title=Watch the 'Black Mirror' Christmas Special With Jon Hamm | work=[[The Observer]] | date=30 December 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/22/charlie-brooker-black-mirror_n_6508790.html | first=Lauren | last=Duca | title='Black Mirror' Intends To 'Actively Unsettle' Audiences, But It's Not Technology That You Should Fear | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=22 January 2015 | accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn 16 December 2014, the episode aired on [[Channel 4]] at 9 p.m. The [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] reports figures of 1.66 million viewers in the first 7 days, and 2.07 million viewers after 28 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/weekly-top-30|title=Weekly top 30 programmes|publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]|accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe episode received critical acclaim.

It was written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by Carl Tibbetts, and first aired on [[Channel 4]] on 16 December 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yoshida|first1=Emily|title=Here's the first promo for the Black Mirror Christmas Special|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/4/7333243/first-promo-black-mirror-christmas-special-white-christmas-jon-hamm-charlie-brooker|accessdate=5 December 2014|work=The Verge|date=5 December 2014}}</ref> The only television special of the series, it was also the last episode to be aired on Channel 4, as the series would move to [[Netflix]] for its third season.\n\nThe episode starts with two men, Matt ([[Jon Hamm]]) and Joe ([[Rafe Spall]]), stationed at a remote outpost in the middle of a snowy wilderness. As they tell each other their respective lives to pass the time, those events are [[Story within a story|depicted on-screen]], forming three mini-stories ultimately relating to the characters' current situation.<ref name=sunopxmas>{{cite news|title=Jon Hamm in Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror special - first pictures|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/news/a612187/jon-hamm-in-charlie-brookers-black-mirror-special-first-pictures.html#~oWzCSOMCaoS11U|accessdate=24 November 2014|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=24 November 2014}}</ref> [[Oona Chaplin]] and [[Natalia Tena]] co-star as two characters in these stories.\n\nThe episode received very positive reviews, with praise for the performances of Hamm and Spall, the writing, and the [[plot twist|twist ending]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per [[MOS:TVPLOT]], the plot summary needs to be 400 words or less. -->\nJoe Potter (Spall) awakens in a cabin on a snowy Christmas Day, greeted by Matt Trent (Hamm). The two have lived there for five years but barely spoken. To get Joe to open up, Matt explains why he ended up in the cabin. He used to run an online group who watched each other seduce women, through \"Z-Eyes\" which record vision and hearing. One member, Harry (Hardiker), crashed an office Christmas party and talked to Jennifer (Tena). She was mentally ill, heard voices and mistook his Z-Eyes communication for him doing so too. After they returned to her place, she poisoned them both in a [[murder-suicide]].\n\nMatt also talks about his job, training \"cookies\" of people\u2014digital clones stored in an egg-shaped object\u2014as personal assistants. He describes the experience of Greta's (Chaplin) cookie, who refused to be a personal assistant. Matt fast-forwarded time inside the cookie's world for six months, and she relented under the threat of further boredom and isolation.\n\nJoe reluctantly talks. He was \"blocked\" by his fianc\u00e9e Beth (Montgomery) after the two fought over her decision to have an abortion. Blocking causes them to see each other and their offspring as grey silhouettes and prevents Joe from contacting Beth. Months later, Joe tried to confront her still-pregnant silhouette, leading to legal enforcement of the block. Each Christmas Eve, Joe travelled to Beth's father's house to spy on the little girl. The block was removed when Beth died in a train accident, which allowed Joe to discover that Beth had an affair and he was not the child's father. In a distressed confrontation with Beth's father, Joe struck him with a snow globe, killing him, and left. The girl found her grandfather and set off into the snowy wilderness to get help, only to freeze to death.\n\nWhile telling the story, the cabin gradually transforms into Beth's father's house. Joe and Matt are in a cookie, the five years having been a result of altered perception of time, and Joe's cookie has given testimony which can be used to convict Joe. In exchange for extracting the confession, Matt avoids imprisonment for his role in Harry's death, but he is now convicted as a [[sex offender]] and is permanently blocked by everyone. Meanwhile, an officer sets Joe's cookie to experience time at 1,000 years per minute, with the song \"[[I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday]]\"\u2014which played as he killed Beth's father\u2014on repeat.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Jon Hamm]] as Matt, a former dating coach who uses psychological manipulation to pull a murder confession from Joe Potter, in exchange for leniency in his own legal battle surrounding the death of one of his clients.\n* [[Rafe Spall]] as Joe, a man traumatized by emotional abuse he suffered by being separated from whom he believed to be his daughter and, in a fit of emotional distress, commits murder.\n* [[Oona Chaplin]] as Greta, a sentient digital clone who is made to serve her human or face an eternity of isolation.\n* [[Rasmus Hardiker]] as Harry, an insecure young man who utilizes Matt's services as a dating coach and is ultimately murdered by his romantic interest, Jennifer.\n* [[Natalia Tena]] as Jennifer, a psychotic woman who kills herself and her fellow party-goer, Harry.\n* [[Janet Montgomery]] as Bethany, Joe's fiancee who is unfaithful to him, resulting in her pregnancy.\n* Dan Li as Tim, Bethany's co-worker and lover.\n* [[Zahra Ahmadi]] as Gita, Beth's co-worker and Tim's girlfriend.\n* [[Robin Weaver]] as Detective Holder, a police officer charged with the task of soliciting a confession from Joe for his role in the deaths of Bethany's father, Gordon, and daughter, May.\n* Ken Drury as Gordon, Bethany's father and custodial guardian of his granddaughter, May.\n* [[Verity Marshall]] as Amy, a fellow party-goer at the company event where Harry meets Jennifer.\n* [[Esther Smith]] as Madge\n* Ian Keir Attard as Dawson\n\n==Production==\nFollowing the second series of ''Black Mirror'', [[Channel 4]] agreed on a third series of four episodes on the condition that detailed synopses of episodes were given. After presenting some ideas to the channel, series creator [[Charlie Brooker]] and executive producer Annabel Jones were told that they \"weren't very ''Black Mirror''\", leaving the show in a limbo situation. A year later, Brooker and Jones were able to negotiate a 90-minute Christmas special, \"White Christmas\". The episode incorporated one of the ideas they pitched, \"Angel of the Morning\", which became the dating storyline with Matt, Harry and Jennifer.<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>{{rp|102\u2013103}} \"White Christmas\" was the last ''Black Mirror'' episode produced under Channel 4; following this, the series moved to [[Netflix]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|126\u2013127}} It aired on 16 December 2014 in the United Kingdom.\n\n===Writing and casting===\nThe episode was written by Brooker. It was directed by Carl Tibbetts, who had previously directed series two episode \"[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|77}} When Tibbetts was hired, Brooker and Jones had four or five concepts for the series. Inspirations for the episode, which is a portmanteau of three stories, include the 1945 horror film ''[[Dead of Night]]''<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106}} and the 1983 science fiction film ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]'',<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|103}} both of which are anthologies. The setting of a spaceship was briefly considered.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106}}\n\nThe episode's stories introduce two new technologies, which are both important to the ending. The Z-Eyes allows the user to stream video from their eyes and to block people from their vision. The other technology is a duplicate of a person's consciousness, stored in a small egg-shaped cookie. Unprecedented for the show, \"White Christmas\" reuses technology from another episode: after several designs for the Z-Eyes, it was decided that the device from series one episode \"[[The Entire History of You]]\" should be used.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106}}\n\nIn the first draft, Trent's character was cheerful and [[cockney]] to contrast with Joe.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|107}} In mid-2014, [[Jon Hamm]] wanted to meet with Brooker, having enjoyed previous series of the programme. Following this, he was offered a part as Trent.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|107}} Whilst the original version had Trent be slightly grating, Hamm was keen for his character to be likeable and affable as a contrast to his odious actions.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|112}}\n\nJoe is played by [[Rafe Spall]], who had previously read a script for another ''Black Mirror'' episode.<ref name=premds>{{cite news|title=Black Mirror: Charlie Brooker, Jon Hamm on the dark side of Yuletide|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/interviews/a616435/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-jon-hamm-on-the-dark-side-of-yuletide|accessdate=14 December 2014|work=Digital Spy|date=14 December 2014}}</ref> The episode opens with Joe and the viewer first sees Trent through Joe's eyes. He is initially very quiet and not able to recall precisely why he is in the cabin. Every time the cabin is shown, some details are changed until it becomes the house in which Joe commits the murder. The cooker, work surface, fireplace and clock are some of these details. Additionally, at one point Joe hears a noise which is his cell sliding shut as someone checks on him.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|112\u2013113}}\n\nThe first story about dating featured Trent, Harry and Jennifer. It was inspired by Brooker's observations of people on the street using [[Bluetooth]] headsets for calls, who looked like they were talking to themselves \"as if they had a mental illness\". The horse anecdote was inspired by Brooker reading \"bullshit ice-breakers\" used by [[pickup artist]]s.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|115}}\n\n[[Oona Chaplin]] was cast as Greta, roughly two days before filming, when Chaplin was working in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|117}} The second story, where Matt sets up Greta's cookie, was inspired by the comedic idea of someone who \"put a consciousness into a toaster\", and the toaster then falls in love with them. Brooker had considered this idea for a while, and realised it was a \"fucking nightmare\" rather than a love story. One draft of the story showed Greta's cookie watching Greta play with her kids, realising that she would never be able to hug her children again. This scene was rejected as \"too weird and nasty\" for the episode, but later used in series four episode \"[[Black Museum (Black Mirror)|Black Museum]]\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|117}}\n\nThe third story is about Joe and his girlfriend Beth. It was based on an idea from Brooker's 2001 series ''[[Unnovations]]'' in which a pair of glasses showed homeless people as cartoon characters. With the invention of [[Google Glass]], this looked more possible in reality. The idea of blocking on social media was also considered. The ending takes inspiration from [[Stephen King]]'s 1981 short story \"[[The Jaunt]]\" and the 1982 series finale of ''[[Sapphire & Steel]]''.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|118}} Similar to \"White Bear\", Joe is a character who is tortured after committing a crime.\n\n===Filming, music and editing===\nFor the setting, a slightly futuristic [[London]] and a world in which the characters lived on boats were both considered. However, the episode had a very limited budget. Filming took place in four corners of London within a short period of time, which posed a challenge. Sets were built at [[Twickenham]], which would be used during production of later series.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106\u2013107}} The cabin was designed to look timeless, with Trent's outfit looking cleaner than the environment, while Joe's is warm.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|113}} The episode was shot in October, during a period when Hamm and Spall both had heavy colds.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|112}}\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Jon Opstad. The colour palettes, costumes and soundtrack of the three stories are designed to be similar to each other, to give the episode an overarching identity. The first story has monochrome tones and a \"lopsided weirdness\" to its soundtrack; Jennifer's dress is made of navy leather and mesh to signify her role as a dominatrix.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|115}}\n\nJetlagged, Chaplin fell asleep during some of her early scenes, which required her to lie down on an operating table. Greta wears an outfit similar to a [[kimono]], to indicate her \"[[Zen]]-like existence\", while her cookie wears a [[neoprene]] fabric. The score for the second story is \"crisp, clean [and] sterile\", using digital synths to contrast with the rest of the soundtrack.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|117}} The third story changes \"from romance to tragedy\", so its score incorporates a [[viola]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|118}} A scene where Beth struggles to get a vomiting Joe into a taxi was cut from filming due to time constraints.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nThe ending shows Joe smashing the radio repeatedly, as it reappears each time. It was decided on the day that this should be filmed in one continuous take, with stagehands quickly replacing the radio on the table; this was difficult due to their limited supply of radios. A shot of Joe smashing the snow globe, only for it to reappear, was cut. During filming, Brooker had an idea for the closing moments, which show the camera continually panning out from the cabin to show it inside a snow globe. The effect used lots of different [[take]]s as well as visual effects.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|120}} Editing took place up to the day of its press screening at Channel 4, leading Brooker to delay work on his ''[[2014 Wipe]]''.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|123}}\n\n==Analysis==\nThematically, the episode addresses the topic of punishment and of whether [[artificial intelligence]] can be \"a form of life\". It also has commentary on [[cyberstalking]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nBoth Joe and Trent are unreliable narrators. Brooker commented that the viewer quickly loses sympathy for Joe in the third story, as he is obnoxious towards Beth and is hinted to have an issue with alcohol. Joe is \"possessive and has an explosive temper\" and Brooker believes him to be the \"root cause\" of the issues in his and Beth's relationship. Brooker commented of Joe deserving his punishment, \"he did and he didn't\", and says that viewers may find Trent's punishment harsh because he is charming. Hamm opined that Trent deserved punishment but should have a path to redemption.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|120}}\n\nBrooker thought the episode may have been the last for the programme, so he included [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] which referred to previous episodes.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|106}} In the beginning of the scene in which Matt's computer shows dating club clients in the conference call, one of the users has the nickname, \"I_AM_WALDO\", and another, \"Pie Ape\". The Z-Eyes are reminiscent of a similar device in \"[[The Entire History of You]]\". Clips of TV shows from \"[[The Waldo Moment]]\" and \"[[Fifteen Million Merits]]\" are visible when Joe flicks through the TV channels. The pregnancy test Joe finds is the same one used in \"[[Be Right Back]]\". The [[News ticker|ticker]] during a news report mentions the prime minister from \"[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]\", as well as Victoria Skillane from \"[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]\", and Liam Monroe from \"The Waldo Moment\". Bethany sings \"Anyone Who Knows What Love Is\", the same song that Abi sings in \"Fifteen Million Merits\".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://observer.com/2014/12/cookies-arent-grains-debunking-the-single-universe-theory-of-black-mirror/ | first=Drew | last=Grant | title=Watch the 'Black Mirror' Christmas Special With Jon Hamm | work=[[The Observer]] | date=30 December 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/22/charlie-brooker-black-mirror_n_6508790.html | first=Lauren | last=Duca | title='Black Mirror' Intends To 'Actively Unsettle' Audiences, But It's Not Technology That You Should Fear | work=[[The Huffington Post]] | date=22 January 2015 | accessdate=19 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nOn 16 December 2014, the episode aired on [[Channel 4]] at 9 p.m. The [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] reports figures of 1.66 million viewers in the first 7 days, and 2.07 million viewers after 28 days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing-data/weekly-top-30|title=Weekly top 30 programmes|publisher=[[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]]|accessdate=10 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe episode received critical acclaim.

After a politician he interviewed\u2014Liam Munroe ([[Tobias Menzies]])\u2014enters a [[by-election]] to become [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|member of parliament]], Waldo stands as a candidate. Meanwhile, Jamie and another candidate Gwendolyn Harris ([[Chloe Pirrie]]) have sex. Waldo's popularity continues to rise, but Jamie becomes increasingly discontent with the role he is playing.\n\nThe episode is in contrast to other ''Black Mirror'' episodes with its contemporary setting; it explores public distrust of politicians. Initially based in part on the politician and future British prime minister [[Boris Johnson]], the character of Waldo was widely compared to business magnate [[Donald Trump]] following his successful [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 campaign]] to become President of the United States. The episode was considered by critics to be very poor in comparison to other ''Black Mirror'' episodes, with criticisms made of its reliance on tropes and its ending. The characters of Waldo and Jamie received mixed reception.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[MOS:TVPLOT]], the plot summary of Wikipedia articles about television episodes must be no longer than 400 words. -->\nOn a topical comedy show, Jamie Salter ([[Daniel Rigby]]) plays Waldo\u2014a vulgar, blue animated bear who interviews public figures under the pretence of filming a children's television programme. After [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician Liam Munroe ([[Tobias Menzies]]) files a complaint over his interview, a [[television pilot]] of a programme starring Waldo is commissioned. Despite this, Jamie is dissatisfied with his life, particularly over a recent breakup. At a meeting led by producer Tamsin ([[Christina Chong]]), executive Jack Napier ([[Jason Flemyng]]) notes that Munroe is standing to become a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|member of parliament]] in the [[by-election]] for the [[United Kingdom constituencies|constitutency]] of Stentonford and Hersham. It is agreed that Waldo should stand as a candidate.\n\nPlaying Waldo on the side of a van, Jamie goads Munroe into confrontation as he campaigns. Meanwhile, Gwendolyn Harris ([[Chloe Pirrie]]) has been chosen as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate, though the constituency is a [[safe seat]] for the Conservatives. Harris and Jamie get drunk together, Jamie expressing his displeasure at being stuck as Waldo and Harris admitting she will not win. They have sex and promise to continue their relationship. Harris' campaign manager Roy (Michael Shaeffer) is alarmed that she talked to Jamie. Harris tells Jamie that she cannot see him during the campaign.\n\nWaldo and the other candidates are invited to a student-organised [[hustings]], in which Munroe details Jamie's mostly unsuccessful television career and derides his message as meaningless. Jamie attacks both Munroe and Harris as disingenuous career politicians. Waldo's rant goes viral on [[YouTube]] and he is invited to an interview with Philip Crane ([[Pip Torrens]]) on ''Consensus''. Jamie is reluctant to continue as Waldo but does so after Jack threatens to play him instead. Afterwards, Jack and Jamie meet with American agent Jeff Carter ([[David Ajala]]), who talks about the advantages of a cartoon figurehead over a human in spreading political messages.\n\nJamie tries to apologise to Harris but she is furious with him. The next day, as Waldo, Jamie urges people not to vote for him; Jack takes over as Waldo and incites a member of the public to hit Jamie. In hospital, Jamie sees the results of the election: Munroe won, Waldo was second and Harris was third. In the final scene, Jamie is homeless and ordered to move on by police. He sees a screen displaying Waldo on every channel, in different languages. When he throws a bottle at it, the police taser and attack him.\n\n==Production==\n{{external media\n|video1 = \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJdJdJUhaIc Waldo Trailer]\"<br>A trailer for \"The Waldo Moment\"\n|video2 = \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B12tr8APqsw The Waldo Moment]\"<br>A behind-the-scenes look at the episode\n}}\n\"The Waldo Moment\" was the third episode of the second series of ''[[Black Mirror]]'', produced by Zeppotron for [[Endemol]].

It originates from an idea by Brooker and [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], conceived when the pair were writing ''[[Nathan Barley]]'' in 2005. They imagined a politician based on the British virtual band [[Gorillaz]], whose members are animated cartoon characters. When Brooker came to write the episode, he took inspiration for Waldo's character on British politician [[Boris Johnson]],<ref name=\"Vulture interview\"/><ref name=\"TimeOut\">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/tv-and-radio-guide/charlie-brooker-and-hayley-atwell-discuss-black-mirror|title=Charlie Brooker and Hayley Atwell discuss 'Black Mirror'|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|last=Tate|first=Gabriel|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> and [[Ali G]] was also an inspiration.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37714850|title=Black Mirror: Backlash against writer inspired episode|publisher=[[BBC]]|last=Jones|first=Emma|date=21 October 2016|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> [[J\u00f3n Gnarr]], a stand-up comedian who became mayor of [[Reykjav\u00edk]], was another reference point, and after the episode idea was conceived.<ref name=\"Wired interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/charlie-brooker|title=Charlie Brooker Q&A: the drug of tech has us hooked.

Some of Jamie's dialogue is based on Brooker's own perspective from his career, such as co-presenting ''[[10 O'Clock Live]]'', a political comedy which ran from 2011 to 2013.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nBrooker commented that the episode was rushed due to time constraints, as he was busy rewriting drafts of another series two episode, \"[[White Bear (Black Mirror)|White Bear]]\". He had wanted to do more research, though he did consult with his sister-in-law [[Rupa Huq]], a Labour politician. Brooker said in 2018 that the idea should have been executed in a longer format, such as a two-part episode, miniseries or movie. He also wanted Jamie to be in more jeopardy, and to further develop the idea of Waldo as a \"lightning rod for dissatisfaction with politicians\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/> He expressed regret at rejecting the idea of having Gwendolyn and Jamie be ex-partners.<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | chapter = The Waldo Moment | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nBrooker based Waldo on Ratz, a virtual floating cat head from the first series of 1990s children's show ''[[Live & Kicking]]''. As Waldo was controlled live during filming, using state-of-the-art live animation techniques, several months of pre-production work was done at the design studio Painting Practice. Staff at [[Passion Pictures]] worked on animation, having recently developed the animated meerkat Aleksandr for the advertising campaign [[Compare the Meerkat]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nBryn Higgins directed the episode. Describing the comedy as \"implicit\", Higgins aimed to film the episode in the style of a \"fairly slick modern thriller\". The technology shown in the episode was not too far beyond what was possible at the time, as Brooker wanted the episode to veer away from science fiction. The rig used mapped the emotions and facial movements of the performer onto the Waldo character, and it is seen in the episode. As well as Rigby, four puppeteers controlled Waldo, assigned to the roles of his eyes, his mouth, his body and the rest. Brooker requested Waldo's animation to be purposefully clunky so that the viewer would believe that Jamie was controlling him live.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nThe Waldo van was taken to [[High Wycombe]], a town in southeast England, where members of the public were involved in interacting with Waldo. Due to legal concerns, Waldo's penis was not shown in public. Following Liam Munroe's line \"He's making the whole system look absurd. Which it may well be, but it built these roads\", it was planned for the car to go over a pothole, but this was cut as it looked like a camera mistake.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\n\"The Waldo Moment\" is a [[political satire]] and [[dystopia]]; it features aspects of dark humour.<ref name=\"DoG Lambie\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/24606/black-mirror-series-2-episode-3-the-waldo-moment-spoiler-filled-review|title=Black Mirror series 2 episode 3: The Waldo Moment spoiler-filled review|work=[[Den of Geek]]|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ds ranking\"/><ref name=\"collider ranking\"/> It differs from most previous episodes in its lack of science fiction elements and absence of technology as a key theme.<ref name=\"DoG Lambie\"/><ref name=\"collider ranking\"/><ref name=\"HuffPost\"/> It bears similarities to the programme's first episode, \"[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]\", which also has a storyline where \"the political process is subverted by the general public's insatiable appetite for stupidity and scandal\", according to Sam Parker of ''[[HuffPost]]''.<ref name=\"HuffPost\"/>\n\n\"The Waldo Moment\" explores distrust and apathy towards politicians.<ref name=\"DoG Lambie\"/> Ryan Lambie of [[Den of Geek]] summarised the episode's message in the phrase \"self-absorption will be the death of politics\",<ref name=\"DoG Lambie\"/> whilst Parker felt that the episode demonstrated \"a desire for a more honest form of politics\".<ref name=\"HuffPost\">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/sam-parker/black-mirror-review-the-waldo-moment_b_2764672.html|title=Black Mirror: 'The Waldo Moment' (review)|work=[[HuffPost]]|last=Parker|first=Sam|date=28 April 2013|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref> Serena Davies of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' commented that the episode was \"a mockery of the deeply compromised ideals of modern politics\", whilst reminding viewers that politicians are \"all we've got\".<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9893606/Black-Mirror-The-Waldo-Moment-Channel-4-review.html|title=Black Mirror: The Waldo Moment, Channel 4, review|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|last=Davies|first=Serena|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref> Morgan Jeffery of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' analysed that the episode criticises satire and \"those who persecute others without having anything meaningful to say\",<ref name=\"DS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a461004/black-mirror-series-two-the-waldo-moment-review/|title='Black Mirror' series two 'The Waldo Moment' review|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Jeffery|first=Morgan|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref> and Emily Yoshida of ''[[Grantland]]'' believed that it exposed the issues of \"cheap humour\" being leveraged by politicians.<ref name=\"Grantland\">{{cite web|url=https://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/black-mirror-episode-6-the-waldo-moment-vote-for-stupid/|title=Black Mirror Episode 6, 'The Waldo Moment': Vote for Stupid|work=[[Grantland]]|last=Yoshida|first=Emily|date=18 December 2013|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image|align=right|total_width=350|image1=Boris Johnson official portrait (cropped).jpg|alt1=Boris Johnson|image2=Donald Trump official portrait.jpg|alt2=Donald Trump|footer=Politicians [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Donald Trump]] were widely compared to the character of Waldo, with Brooker describing the figures as \"entertainers\" who \"upend normality\".<ref name=\"BBC\"/>}}\nBoris Johnson, a British politician who became prime minister in 2019, was an inspiration for Waldo's character.

It was written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by Bryn Higgins, and first aired on [[Channel 4]] on 25 February 2013. The episode originated in an idea for ''[[Nathan Barley]]'', an earlier TV show by Brooker and [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]].\n\nThe episode tells the story of Jamie ([[Daniel Rigby]]), an unhappy comedian who plays a blue animated bear called Waldo in a satirical television programme. After a politician he interviewed\u2014Liam Munroe ([[Tobias Menzies]])\u2014enters a [[by-election]] to become [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|member of parliament]], Waldo stands as a candidate. Meanwhile, Jamie and another candidate Gwendolyn Harris ([[Chloe Pirrie]]) have sex. Waldo's popularity continues to rise, but Jamie becomes increasingly discontent with the role he is playing.\n\nThe episode is in contrast to other ''Black Mirror'' episodes with its contemporary setting; it explores public distrust of politicians. Initially based in part on the politician and future British prime minister [[Boris Johnson]], the character of Waldo was widely compared to business magnate [[Donald Trump]] following his successful [[Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign|2016 campaign]] to become President of the United States. The episode was considered by critics to be very poor in comparison to other ''Black Mirror'' episodes, with criticisms made of its reliance on tropes and its ending. The characters of Waldo and Jamie received mixed reception.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[MOS:TVPLOT]], the plot summary of Wikipedia articles about television episodes must be no longer than 400 words. -->\nOn a topical comedy show, Jamie Salter ([[Daniel Rigby]]) plays Waldo\u2014a vulgar, blue animated bear who interviews public figures under the pretence of filming a children's television programme. After [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician Liam Munroe ([[Tobias Menzies]]) files a complaint over his interview, a [[television pilot]] of a programme starring Waldo is commissioned. Despite this, Jamie is dissatisfied with his life, particularly over a recent breakup. At a meeting led by producer Tamsin ([[Christina Chong]]), executive Jack Napier ([[Jason Flemyng]]) notes that Munroe is standing to become a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|member of parliament]] in the [[by-election]] for the [[United Kingdom constituencies|constitutency]] of Stentonford and Hersham. It is agreed that Waldo should stand as a candidate.\n\nPlaying Waldo on the side of a van, Jamie goads Munroe into confrontation as he campaigns. Meanwhile, Gwendolyn Harris ([[Chloe Pirrie]]) has been chosen as the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate, though the constituency is a [[safe seat]] for the Conservatives. Harris and Jamie get drunk together, Jamie expressing his displeasure at being stuck as Waldo and Harris admitting she will not win. They have sex and promise to continue their relationship. Harris' campaign manager Roy (Michael Shaeffer) is alarmed that she talked to Jamie. Harris tells Jamie that she cannot see him during the campaign.\n\nWaldo and the other candidates are invited to a student-organised [[hustings]], in which Munroe details Jamie's mostly unsuccessful television career and derides his message as meaningless. Jamie attacks both Munroe and Harris as disingenuous career politicians. Waldo's rant goes viral on [[YouTube]] and he is invited to an interview with Philip Crane ([[Pip Torrens]]) on ''Consensus''. Jamie is reluctant to continue as Waldo but does so after Jack threatens to play him instead. Afterwards, Jack and Jamie meet with American agent Jeff Carter ([[David Ajala]]), who talks about the advantages of a cartoon figurehead over a human in spreading political messages.\n\nJamie tries to apologise to Harris but she is furious with him. The next day, as Waldo, Jamie urges people not to vote for him; Jack takes over as Waldo and incites a member of the public to hit Jamie. In hospital, Jamie sees the results of the election: Munroe won, Waldo was second and Harris was third. In the final scene, Jamie is homeless and ordered to move on by police. He sees a screen displaying Waldo on every channel, in different languages. When he throws a bottle at it, the police taser and attack him.\n\n==Production==\n{{external media\n|video1 = \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJdJdJUhaIc Waldo Trailer]\"<br>A trailer for \"The Waldo Moment\"\n|video2 = \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B12tr8APqsw The Waldo Moment]\"<br>A behind-the-scenes look at the episode\n}}\n\"The Waldo Moment\" was the third episode of the second series of ''[[Black Mirror]]'', produced by Zeppotron for [[Endemol]].

It originates from an idea by Brooker and [[Chris Morris (satirist)|Chris Morris]], conceived when the pair were writing ''[[Nathan Barley]]'' in 2005. They imagined a politician based on the British virtual band [[Gorillaz]], whose members are animated cartoon characters. When Brooker came to write the episode, he took inspiration for Waldo's character on British politician [[Boris Johnson]],<ref name=\"Vulture interview\"/><ref name=\"TimeOut\">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/tv-and-radio-guide/charlie-brooker-and-hayley-atwell-discuss-black-mirror|title=Charlie Brooker and Hayley Atwell discuss 'Black Mirror'|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|last=Tate|first=Gabriel|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> and [[Ali G]] was also an inspiration.<ref name=\"BBC\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37714850|title=Black Mirror: Backlash against writer inspired episode|publisher=[[BBC]]|last=Jones|first=Emma|date=21 October 2016|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> [[J\u00f3n Gnarr]], a stand-up comedian who became mayor of [[Reykjav\u00edk]], was another reference point, and after the episode idea was conceived.<ref name=\"Wired interview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/charlie-brooker|title=Charlie Brooker Q&A: the drug of tech has us hooked.

He had wanted to do more research, though he did consult with his sister-in-law [[Rupa Huq]], a Labour politician. Brooker said in 2018 that the idea should have been executed in a longer format, such as a two-part episode, miniseries or movie. He also wanted Jamie to be in more jeopardy, and to further develop the idea of Waldo as a \"lightning rod for dissatisfaction with politicians\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/> He expressed regret at rejecting the idea of having Gwendolyn and Jamie be ex-partners.<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | chapter = The Waldo Moment | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>\n\n===Pre-production===\nBrooker based Waldo on Ratz, a virtual floating cat head from the first series of 1990s children's show ''[[Live & Kicking]]''. As Waldo was controlled live during filming, using state-of-the-art live animation techniques, several months of pre-production work was done at the design studio Painting Practice. Staff at [[Passion Pictures]] worked on animation, having recently developed the animated meerkat Aleksandr for the advertising campaign [[Compare the Meerkat]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nBryn Higgins directed the episode. Describing the comedy as \"implicit\", Higgins aimed to film the episode in the style of a \"fairly slick modern thriller\". The technology shown in the episode was not too far beyond what was possible at the time, as Brooker wanted the episode to veer away from science fiction. The rig used mapped the emotions and facial movements of the performer onto the Waldo character, and it is seen in the episode. As well as Rigby, four puppeteers controlled Waldo, assigned to the roles of his eyes, his mouth, his body and the rest. Brooker requested Waldo's animation to be purposefully clunky so that the viewer would believe that Jamie was controlling him live.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nThe Waldo van was taken to [[High Wycombe]], a town in southeast England, where members of the public were involved in interacting with Waldo. Due to legal concerns, Waldo's penis was not shown in public. Following Liam Munroe's line \"He's making the whole system look absurd. Which it may well be, but it built these roads\", it was planned for the car to go over a pothole, but this was cut as it looked like a camera mistake.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\n\"The Waldo Moment\" is a [[political satire]] and [[dystopia]]; it features aspects of dark humour.<ref name=\"DoG Lambie\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/24606/black-mirror-series-2-episode-3-the-waldo-moment-spoiler-filled-review|title=Black Mirror series 2 episode 3: The Waldo Moment spoiler-filled review|work=[[Den of Geek]]|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"ds ranking\"/><ref name=\"collider ranking\"/> It differs from most previous episodes in its lack of science fiction elements and absence of technology as a key theme.<ref name=\"DoG Lambie\"/><ref name=\"collider ranking\"/><ref name=\"HuffPost\"/> It bears similarities to the programme's first episode, \"[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]\", which also has a storyline where \"the political process is subverted by the general public's insatiable appetite for stupidity and scandal\", according to Sam Parker of ''[[HuffPost]]''.<ref name=\"HuffPost\"/>\n\n\"The Waldo Moment\" explores distrust and apathy towards politicians.<ref name=\"DoG Lambie\"/> Ryan Lambie of [[Den of Geek]] summarised the episode's message in the phrase \"self-absorption will be the death of politics\",<ref name=\"DoG Lambie\"/> whilst Parker felt that the episode demonstrated \"a desire for a more honest form of politics\".<ref name=\"HuffPost\">{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/sam-parker/black-mirror-review-the-waldo-moment_b_2764672.html|title=Black Mirror: 'The Waldo Moment' (review)|work=[[HuffPost]]|last=Parker|first=Sam|date=28 April 2013|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref> Serena Davies of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' commented that the episode was \"a mockery of the deeply compromised ideals of modern politics\", whilst reminding viewers that politicians are \"all we've got\".<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9893606/Black-Mirror-The-Waldo-Moment-Channel-4-review.html|title=Black Mirror: The Waldo Moment, Channel 4, review|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|last=Davies|first=Serena|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref> Morgan Jeffery of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' analysed that the episode criticises satire and \"those who persecute others without having anything meaningful to say\",<ref name=\"DS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a461004/black-mirror-series-two-the-waldo-moment-review/|title='Black Mirror' series two 'The Waldo Moment' review|work=[[Digital Spy]]|last=Jeffery|first=Morgan|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref> and Emily Yoshida of ''[[Grantland]]'' believed that it exposed the issues of \"cheap humour\" being leveraged by politicians.<ref name=\"Grantland\">{{cite web|url=https://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/black-mirror-episode-6-the-waldo-moment-vote-for-stupid/|title=Black Mirror Episode 6, 'The Waldo Moment': Vote for Stupid|work=[[Grantland]]|last=Yoshida|first=Emily|date=18 December 2013|accessdate=21 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image|align=right|total_width=350|image1=Boris Johnson official portrait (cropped).jpg|alt1=Boris Johnson|image2=Donald Trump official portrait.jpg|alt2=Donald Trump|footer=Politicians [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Donald Trump]] were widely compared to the character of Waldo, with Brooker describing the figures as \"entertainers\" who \"upend normality\".<ref name=\"BBC\"/>}}\nBoris Johnson, a British politician who became prime minister in 2019, was an inspiration for Waldo's character.
