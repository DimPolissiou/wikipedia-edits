During that time the Colts were led by seven different [[List of Indianapolis Colts head coaches|head coaches]] and seventeen different [[List of Indianapolis Colts starting quarterbacks|starting quarterbacks]]. The organization made three postseason appearances during the time, with the most success coming in 1995 and 1996 under quarterback [[Jim Harbaugh]].

Under Manning the Colts saw their greatest success and during his time with the team made 11 postseason appearances, with nine consecutive appearances from 2002 to 2010.

On December 18, 1983, the Colts played what would become their final home game in the city of Baltimore. 27,934 fans showed up, 516 more fans than the crowd that had turned out for their first home game in 1947. In February 1984, after relations between Irsay and the city of Baltimore had deteriorated significantly, Baltimore Mayor [[William Donald Schaefer|Schaefer]] asked the Maryland General Assembly to approve $15 million for renovation to [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]].

It [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy#Settlement|kept the Browns legacy in Cleveland]], and Modell took his players and organization to Baltimore, which would be [[History of the Baltimore Ravens#Origins|officially regarded as an expansion team]]. After the Browns relocated to Baltimore, Modell offered the Irsay family $5 million for the rights to the Colts heritage.

Peyton Manning was awarded the [[Super Bowl MVP]] after completing 25 of 38 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown, caught by Reggie Wayne. Colts' running backs [[Dominic Rhodes]] and Joseph Addai combined for 190 rushing yards and a touchdown, while kicker Adam Vinatieri converted 3 of his 4 [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] attempts. Defensively, safety [[Bob Sanders]] and cornerback [[Kelvin Hayden]] each intercepted Bears' quarterback [[Rex Grossman]] late in the game, with Hayden returning his for 56 yards and a touchdown, essentially sealing the Colts\u2019 victory. \n \nIndianapolis became the first \u201c[[List of current National Football League stadiums|dome team]]\u201d to win a Super Bowl in an outdoor stadium, the first to win in the rain, and the first to win after having the statistically worst rushing defense in the league during the regular season. [[Tony Dungy]] became only the third man to have won the Super Bowl as both a head coach and a player, as well as the first African-American head coach to win a Super Bowl.

The Patriots won the game 24\u201320 and went on to a 16\u20130 regular season. The Colts, on the other hand, finished 2007 with a 13\u20133 record, winning a club-record fifth straight division title and becoming the first NFL team with five consecutive seasons with 12 or more victories and became one of four NFL teams to open three consecutive seasons with 5\u20130 starts. [[Indianapolis]] joined [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]] (1929\u201331), [[Minnesota]] (1973\u201375) and [[St. Louis]] (1999\u20132001) with three straight 5\u20130 starts and then becoming the first team in 76 years to start three consecutive seasons with 7\u20130 starts. Peyton Manning (288) broke the club record for career touchdown passes held by [[Johnny Unitas]] (287), while [[Tony Dungy]] notched his 74th win to break the franchise record he had shared with [[Don Shula]] (73) and [[Ted Marchibroda]] (73). Dungy became the only coach in Colts history to post 10 or more wins and earn playoff appearances in six straight seasons. Despite all of the success, the club fell in [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|the divisional round]] to the San Diego Chargers, 28\u201324, in the final Colts game at the RCA Dome.\n\nHead coach Tony Dungy announced that he would return for at least one more season, while the Colts also announced that assistant coach [[Jim Caldwell (American football)|Jim Caldwell]] would assume the position of Colts head coach upon the retirement of Dungy.

The Colts were defeated by the Bears and began the season with a 3\u20134 record. However, following a loss at the Titans, the Colts strung together nine consecutive victories, which was good enough for a 12\u20134 final record and a fifth seed wild card position in [[2008\u201309 NFL playoffs|the playoffs]], extending their league mark to six consecutive seasons with 12 or more victories. Manning also won his third NFL MVP award during the season. The Colts, however, for the second straight year lost in the playoffs to the San Diego Chargers and ended the season in disappointment.

In December 2004, the City of Indianapolis and Jim Irsay agreed to a new stadium deal that would benefit both the city and the team at an estimated cost of $675 million. In a deal estimated at $122 million, [[Lucas Oil Products]] won the naming rights to the stadium for 20 years.\n\nIt is a seven-level stadium with a retractable roof seating 63,000 for football.

The new stadium is bigger and better than the RCA Dome in many ways, including: 58 permanent concession stands, 90 portable concession stands, 13 escalators, 11 passenger elevators, 800 restrooms, [[High-definition video|HD]] scoreboards and replay monitors and 142 luxury suites. Other than being the home of the Colts, the stadium hosts games in both the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Men's]] and [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|Women's NCAA Basketball Tournament]]s and serves as the back\u2013up host for all NCAA [[Final Four]] Tournaments. It also hosts numerous events and conventions. The stadium hosted the Super Bowl for the 2012 season ([[Super Bowl XLVI]]) with a potential economic impact estimated at $286,000,001.\n\nIn an ironic twist, a company based near Baltimore, \"Controlled Demolition\", oversaw the demolition of the RCA Dome. \"It's a little ironic that a demolition company from Baltimore had the opportunity to take down the stadium to where the Colts fled when they left Baltimore\", said Mark Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition and a Baltimore Ravens fan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20081221/LOCAL18/812210370/1112/NEWS10 |title=Goodbye, RCA Dome: Former Colts home imploded &#124; The Indianapolis Star |publisher=indystar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===2009: Conference champions===\n{{Main|2009 Indianapolis Colts season}}\n{{See also|Super Bowl XLIV}}\n[[File:Peyton Manning huddle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Colts offense huddles during a 2009 game against [[2009 Jacksonville Jaguars season|the Jacksonville Jaguars]].]]\nThe 2009 offseason saw many changes in the Colts organization, most notably being the fact the Jim Caldwell assumed the duties of head coach following Tony Dungy's retirement, with [[Clyde Christensen]] being promoted to offensive coordinator. The 2009 season also marked the twelfth season that Peyton Manning was the starting quarterback for the Colts.\n\nIndianapolis began the season with their best mark as a franchise in 2009: the Colts set new records by winning their first 14 games, including a come\u2013from\u2013behind victory over the Patriots after a controversial 4th and 2 play. During the season Peyton Manning was sacked only ten times and Indianapolis had the opportunity to repeat New England's 16\u20130 2007 record. However, during the week sixteen matchup against the New York Jets, Jim Caldwell decided to pull the starting line, allowing their opponent an easy win.

Meanwhile, the Jets had made a completely unexpected playoff run by defeating Cincinnati and San Diego and thus engaged the Colts in a rematch for the conference title. Running at full strength, Indianapolis handily defeated the Jets in the AFC Championship Game, 30\u201317, to make their second Super Bowl trip in three years. The Colts met [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]] in Miami for Super Bowl XLIV, both teams the number-one seeds from their respective conferences. Despite a 10\u20130 lead in the first quarter, New Orleans managed to catch up, due in part to an onside kick after half time. The game was decided in the fourth quarter on a Peyton Manning interception thrown to Saints cornerback [[Tracy Porter]], which was returned for a touchdown. Inconsistent play and mistakes by the team sank their chances at another championship, with the Saints defeating the Colts 31\u201317.\n\n===2010===\n{{Main|2010 Indianapolis Colts season}}\nFollowing the Colts\u2019 Super Bowl loss, the organization continued to rebuild and bring in quality players to counter the many veterans on the team. The 2010 season began with a stunning upset defeat in Houston, where [[2010 Houston Texans season|the Texans]] beat them 34\u201324 and poor offensive line performance caused Peyton Manning to take several hits. The next week, the Colts hosted the Giants in the second \u201cManning Bowl\u201d, and as in 2006, Peyton easily overpowered his brother's team to win 38\u201314. However, the remainder of the season was filled with injuries and inconsistent play, with the Colts having, at one point, a 6\u20136 record, ending their streak of seven consecutive seasons with 12 or more victories. Nonetheless, the team was able to win its final four games, including a week seventeen match\u2013up with the Titans, to clinch their second straight AFC South title and fourteenth division title overall. They also clinched their ninth consecutive postseason appearance, tying the all-time record for consecutive postseason appearances by a team with the Dallas Cowboys, who made the playoffs every season between 1975 and 1983. Indianapolis entered the playoffs as the number three seed and faced the New York Jets again, this time in [[2009\u201310 NFL playoffs|the Wild Card round]]. A back and forth game ended with controversial play calling from head coach Jim Caldwell and a last\u2013second field goal by the Jets again ended the Colts\u2019 season short of a Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bishop|first=Greg|title=Jets Narrowly Escape Manning and the Colts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/sports/football/09jets.html|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012|date=January 8, 2011}}</ref> Following the game, Peyton Manning became the focus of controversy because of his advancing age, 35 at the time, and surgery for a herniated neck disc.\n\n===2011: Manning injury===\n{{Main|2011 Indianapolis Colts season}}\nIndianapolis went into the 2011 season with many questions not only about Peyton Manning's health but also his contract status. Manning signed an extension before the beginning of the season, but his availability for the season was in question due to surgery. The league was faced with a lockout from March to July that prevented Manning from using team training facilities to help recover, and when the preseason began he was left on the \u201c[[Physically Unable to Perform]]\u201d list. Originally ruled out for the season opener in Houston, Manning was eventually sidelined for the entire season due to multiple surgeries on his neck.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peyton Manning reportedly has new surgery, out 2-3 months|url=http://nfl.si.com/2011/09/08/jim-irsay-peyton-manning-out-for-awhile/|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202164505/http://nfl.si.com/2011/09/08/jim-irsay-peyton-manning-out-for-awhile/|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Veteran quarterback [[Kerry Collins]] was signed to the team early in the year due to the dissatisfaction with backup quarterbacks [[Curtis Painter]] and [[Dan Orlovsky]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Kerry Collins joins Colts|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6891243/indianapolis-colts-add-kerry-collins-sources-doubt-peyton-manning-ready|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor the first time since 1997, the Colts were not commanded by Peyton Manning and instead were led by Collins in a 34\u20137 loss against the Texans. The season continued to spiral without Manning and the team was quickly 0\u20133 and was forced to start Curtis Painter following an injury to Kerry Collins. The Colts continued to look abysmal under Painter with the team going 0\u201311, including a 62\u20137 loss to the Saints, before Dan Orlovsky was put in to replace Painter at New England. Orlovsky led an effort to beat the Patriots, but the Colts fell to them 31\u201324, to go 0\u201312 on the season. After much media speculation they would equal [[2008 Detroit Lions season|the 2008 Lions]]\u2019 ignominy of losing all sixteen games, the Colts finally won at home against the Titans and the Texans in Weeks 15 and 16, so that they finished with a 2\u201314 record, which was still the second-worst in the Indianapolis era. This record ensured the Colts the number one overall pick in the [[2012 NFL Draft]] and began to stir up controversy over Peyton Manning\u2019s continued presence within the organization.\n\nThe Peyton Manning era came to an end on March 8, 2012 when Jim Irsay announced that Manning was officially being released from the roster after thirteen seasons.<ref name=\"Manning Released\">{{cite web|title=Manning Era Over|url=http://coltsmonkey.com/its-official-peyton-mannings-career-as-a-colt-is-over/|publisher=ColtsMonkey.com|accessdate=June 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006143833/http://coltsmonkey.com/its-official-peyton-mannings-career-as-a-colt-is-over/|archive-date=October 6, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although Manning\u2019s medical condition and throwing strength continued to improve, Irsay stated that the Colts were embarking on \u201can ambitious rebuilding project\u201d and that due to Manning's age, 36, it was unlikely that he could win another Super Bowl before the rebuilding project was finished.

In their first game without their head coach, the Colts faced [[2012 Green Bay Packers season|the Green Bay Packers]], who had compiled a 15\u20131 record the previous season.  The Colts went on to stun the Packers and win the game 30\u201327, rallying from a 21\u20133 deficit in the first half.\n\nFollowing the Green Bay win, Indianapolis went 5\u20131 in their next six games, with their only loss coming against [[2012 New York Jets season|the New York Jets]]. Visiting [[2012 New England Patriots season|New England]] in week eleven, the Colts had compiled a 6\u20133 record, with a playoff berth possible. The Colts lost to the Patriots for the third time in the past three seasons, but went on to win five of their next six games, giving them an 11\u20135 record on the season and guaranteeing them a berth in the postseason. Chuck Pagano returned to the sidelines in week seventeen in a game against [[2012 Houston Texans|the Texans]], which the Colts won 28\u201316. Luck set the rookie record for passing yards in week sixteen against [[2012 Kansas City Chiefs season|the Kansas City Chiefs]], throwing for 4,374 yards on the season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andrew Luck sets NFL rookie record|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/8775022/andrew-luck-indianapolis-colts-sets-nfl-rookie-record-most-passing-yards-breaking-cam-newton-carolina-panthers|publisher=ESPN|date=December 24, 2012|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}</ref>  The Colts faced [[2012 Baltimore Ravens season|the Baltimore Ravens]] in their return to the playoffs; however, an inability to score in the red zone led to the Colts not scoring a single touchdown and eventually losing the game 24\u20139.\n\n====2013====\n{{Main|2013 Indianapolis Colts season}}\n\nThe team's newfound success with Luck at the helm continued into 2013. In the season's third week, Luck returned to Northern California to face [[2013 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]], led by his former Stanford head coach [[Jim Harbaugh]]. Supplementing a strong performance by the defense, Luck threw for 159 yards and rushed for 24, including a 6-yard touchdown scamper late in the fourth quarter that put the Colts up 20\u20137. Indy eventually won 27\u20137 in a game that saw newly acquired running back [[Trent Richardson]] score a touchdown on his first carry as a Colt.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Center: Colts at 49ers|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2013092211/2013/REG3/colts@49ers#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap2000000249093&tab=recap|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWeek 6 saw [[Peyton Manning]]\u2019s return to [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] as the Colts hosted the 5\u20130 [[2013 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]]. Emotions ran high at the game, where the Colts played a tribute video thanking Manning for his contributions to the team. The Colts raced out to a 26-14 halftime lead and went up 36-17 early in the fourth quarter. Although Manning and the Broncos stormed back with two late touchdowns, the Colts held on to beat their former hero 39\u201333. Although both quarterbacks played well, Luck registered a higher quarterback rating than his predecessor, completing 21 of 38 passes for 228 yards and 3 touchdowns. Luck added a rushing touchdown to open the scoring in the third quarter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Center: Broncos at Colts|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2013102012/2013/REG7/broncos@colts#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap2000000266984&tab=recap|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter their emotional defeat of the Broncos, the Colts beat Houston to claim a 6\u20132 record at the season's halfway point. Although the Colts again won the AFC South with an 11\u20135 record, the last half of the season saw some unexpected collapses, including a 38\u20138 loss to [[2013 St. Louis Rams season|the St. Louis Rams]] and a 40\u201311 dismantling by [[2013 Arizona Cardinals season|the Arizona Cardinals]], who were led by former Colts offensive coordinator and interim head coach [[Bruce Arians]].\n\nEntering the playoffs for the second straight year, the Colts hosted [[2013 Kansas City Chiefs season|the Kansas City Chiefs]] in the Wild Card round. The Colts had defeated the Chiefs 23-7 just two weeks earlier, but fell behind 38-10 early in the third quarter thanks to turnovers and an anemic offense. Midway through the third quarter, the defense stiffened and the offense came alive. The Colts stormed back with three third-quarter touchdowns and cut the Chiefs' lead to 41\u201338 early in the fourth period when Andrew Luck scooped up a [[Donald Brown (running back)|Donald Brown]] fumble and lunged into the end zone from five yards out. On the ensuing drive, Kansas City took five minutes off the clock and extended their lead to six points on Ryan Succop's 43-yard field goal. After getting the ball back, the Colts took their first lead of the game when wide receiver [[T. Y. Hilton]] beat two Chiefs defenders and took it to the house on a 64-yard bomb from Andrew Luck. Leading 45\u201344, the Colts stopped Kansas City on fourth down and knelt three times to win the game. The victory went down as the second-largest playoff comeback in NFL history. Luck threw for 443 yards, four touchdowns, and three interceptions. Hilton finished the game with 224 yards and two touchdowns on 13 receptions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Center: Chiefs at Colts|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2014010400/2013/POST18/chiefs@colts#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap2000000310824&tab=recap|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe next week, the Colts traveled to face their old nemesis New England in the Divisional round.

The Colts again finished the season 11\u20135 and entered the playoffs as AFC South champions for the third straight year. The Colts also became the first team of the Super Bowl era to compile 300 or more passing yards in eight consecutive games.\n\nIn the Wild Card round, the Colts played host to [[2014 Cincinnati Bengals season|the Cincinnati Bengals]]. After a close first half, the Colts broke the game open in the second half by scoring 13 unanswered points. On Luck's only touchdown pass of the game, the third-year quarterback stepped up to avoid pressure and threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to receiver [[Donte Moncrief]] just as he was wrapped up around the ankles by a Bengals defender. The Colts defense also turned in an impressive performance, holding the Bengals to 254 total yards and sacking quarterback [[Andy Dalton]] three times en route to a 26\u201310 win.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Center: Bengals at Colts|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2015010400/2014/POST18/bengals@colts#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000453962&tab=recap|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref> The game marked the Bengals' fifth Wild Card round loss in their last six seasons.\n\nThe Colts moved on to face former quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] and [[2014 Denver Broncos season|the Denver Broncos]], who had defeated them 31\u201324 in Week 1 of the regular season. The Colts offensive line didn't allow a sack, letting Andrew Luck throw for 265 yards and two touchdowns. Although the Colts' performance was far from perfect, they capitalized on the Broncos\u2019 mistakes. Manning struggled, completing 26 of 46 passes for 211 yards and consistently overthrowing receivers on deep routes. The Broncos could only convert 25 percent of their third-down attempts. The game played out much like the Colts' defeat of the Bengals a week earlier: taking a small lead at halftime before extending that lead in the second half. The Colts defeated the Broncos 24\u201313, marking Peyton Manning's ninth one-and-done loss in the playoffs, seven of which came when he helmed the Colts. It also marked Andrew Luck's third postseason victory, a milestone Manning didn't reach until his seventh year in the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Center: Colts at Broncos|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2015011101/2014/POST19/colts@broncos#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000457739&tab=recap|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIndianapolis moved on to once again face [[2014 New England Patriots season|the New England Patriots]] in the AFC Championship game.

Patriots quarterback [[Tom Brady]] threw three touchdown passes, and runningback [[LeGarrette Blount]] embarrassed the Colts defense in the playoffs for the second straight year by rushing for 148 yards and three scores. The Patriots went on to defeat [[2014 Seattle Seahawks season|the Seattle Seahawks]] in [[Super Bowl XLIX]]. The defeat marked the Colts' sixth straight loss to the Patriots \u2014 not having won since the 2009 \u201c4th and 2\u201d game \u2014 and Andrew Luck's fourth failure in as many tries to defeat New England. Since Andrew Luck took over as quarterback in 2012, the Colts had suffered losses of 35, 21, 22, and 38 points to the Patriots in what was previously a back-and-forth rivalry.\n\nShortly after the Colts\u2019 elimination, controversy arose over the Patriots\u2019 possible underinflation of team footballs during the AFC Championship. This controversy eventually grew into the [[Deflategate]] scandal, prompting some in the sports world to call for New England's disqualification from [[Super Bowl XLIX]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Patriots should be disqualified from the Super Bowl|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/01/patriots-deflate-ball-super-bowl-disqualified-penalties-sanctions|publisher=USA TODAY|date=January 21, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u20132017: Luck injuries and quarterback struggles===\n====2015====\n{{Main|2015 Indianapolis Colts season}}\n\nThe Colts entered the 2015 season having gone 11\u20135 and won the AFC South in each of the previous three seasons. However, the Colts had a middling start to the year, and were 3\u20135 by the season's halfway point. The Colts\u2019 three wins during the first half of the season had all come against divisional opponents, and two of them were engineered by 40-year-old backup quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]], who replaced Andrew Luck during a shoulder injury. After a series of close losses, including a 26\u201329 overtime loss to [[2015 Carolina Panthers season|the Carolina Panthers]], the Colts fired offensive coordinator [[Pep Hamilton]] and elevated [[Rob Chudzinski]] to replace him.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pep Hamilton out as Colts' offensive coordinator|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/14047307/pep-hamilton-indianapolis-colts-offensive-coordinator|date=November 4, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref> The move seemed to have paid off the next week, as the Colts defeated [[2015 Denver Broncos season|the Denver Broncos]] 27\u201324 in what would prove Peyton Manning's last game against his former team.

Out of desperation, the Colts signed [[Antonio Cromartie]] for replacement of Davis. The defense allowed 340 passing yards, 63 rushing yards, 2 rushing touchdowns and 3 passing touchdowns. [[Matthew Stafford]] took advantage of one last chance Sunday and Matt Prater redeemed himself with a 43-yard field goal with 8 seconds to give the Detroit Lions a 39\u201335 victory at Indianapolis. Detroit won for only the second time in Indianapolis, countering an Andrew Luck-led drive that had seemingly rallied the Colts to an improbable last-minute victory. The Colts lost the next game to start at 0\u20132 for the second year in a row. The team finished at 8\u20138 once again, with only one winning streak longer than two games and missing the playoffs despite a weak division.

The Colts, on the other hand, finished 2007 with a 13\u20133 record, winning a club-record fifth straight division title and becoming the first NFL team with five consecutive seasons with 12 or more victories and became one of four NFL teams to open three consecutive seasons with 5\u20130 starts. [[Indianapolis]] joined [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]] (1929\u201331), [[Minnesota]] (1973\u201375) and [[St. Louis]] (1999\u20132001) with three straight 5\u20130 starts and then becoming the first team in 76 years to start three consecutive seasons with 7\u20130 starts. Peyton Manning (288) broke the club record for career touchdown passes held by [[Johnny Unitas]] (287), while [[Tony Dungy]] notched his 74th win to break the franchise record he had shared with [[Don Shula]] (73) and [[Ted Marchibroda]] (73). Dungy became the only coach in Colts history to post 10 or more wins and earn playoff appearances in six straight seasons. Despite all of the success, the club fell in [[2007\u201308 NFL playoffs|the divisional round]] to the San Diego Chargers, 28\u201324, in the final Colts game at the RCA Dome.\n\nHead coach Tony Dungy announced that he would return for at least one more season, while the Colts also announced that assistant coach [[Jim Caldwell (American football)|Jim Caldwell]] would assume the position of Colts head coach upon the retirement of Dungy. Also before the 2008 season, Colts quarterback Peyton Manning had his infected bursa sac removed, sidelining him for the entire pre-season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manning has infected bursa sac removed from left knee|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3487657|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Colts opened the 2008 season in their new home, [[Lucas Oil Stadium]], against the Chicago Bears. The Colts were defeated by the Bears and began the season with a 3\u20134 record. However, following a loss at the Titans, the Colts strung together nine consecutive victories, which was good enough for a 12\u20134 final record and a fifth seed wild card position in [[2008\u201309 NFL playoffs|the playoffs]], extending their league mark to six consecutive seasons with 12 or more victories. Manning also won his third NFL MVP award during the season. The Colts, however, for the second straight year lost in the playoffs to the San Diego Chargers and ended the season in disappointment. Following the 2008 season, head coach Tony Dungy announced his retirement from the team, finishing his career as a Colt with a 92\u201333 record.<ref name=\"Dungy Retires/Caldwell Hired\">{{cite web|title=Dungy retires after 7 seasons with Colts|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3827058|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Lucas Oil Stadium===\n{{Main|Lucas Oil Stadium}}\n[[File:LucasOilStadiumTheLuke.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Colts began playing home games at Lucas Oil Stadium in 2008.]]\nAfter 24 years of playing at the RCA Dome, the Colts moved to their new home, Lucas Oil Stadium. The Colts began playing in Lucas Oil Stadium in the fall of 2008. In December 2004, the City of Indianapolis and Jim Irsay agreed to a new stadium deal that would benefit both the city and the team at an estimated cost of $675 million. In a deal estimated at $122 million, [[Lucas Oil Products]] won the naming rights to the stadium for 20 years.\n\nIt is a seven-level stadium with a retractable roof seating 63,000 for football. It can be reconfigured to seat 70,000 or more for NCAA basketball and football and concerts. It covers {{convert|1.8|e6sqft|m2}}. The stadium features a retractable roof allowing the Colts to play home games outdoors for the first time since arriving in Indianapolis. Using [[FieldTurf]], the playing surface is roughly {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} below ground level. The new stadium is bigger and better than the RCA Dome in many ways, including: 58 permanent concession stands, 90 portable concession stands, 13 escalators, 11 passenger elevators, 800 restrooms, [[high-definition|HD]] scoreboards and replay monitors and 142 luxury suites. Other than being the home of the Colts, the stadium hosts games in both the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Men's]] and [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|Women's NCAA Basketball Tournament]]s and serves as the back\u2013up host for all NCAA [[Final Four]] Tournaments. It also hosts numerous events and conventions. The stadium hosted the Super Bowl for the 2012 season ([[Super Bowl XLVI]]) with a potential economic impact estimated at $286,000,001.\n\nIn an ironic twist, a company based near Baltimore, \"Controlled Demolition\", oversaw the demolition of the RCA Dome. \"It's a little ironic that a demolition company from Baltimore had the opportunity to take down the stadium to where the Colts fled when they left Baltimore\", said Mark Loizeaux, president of Controlled Demolition and a Baltimore Ravens fan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20081221/LOCAL18/812210370/1112/NEWS10 |title=Goodbye, RCA Dome: Former Colts home imploded &#124; The Indianapolis Star |publisher=indystar.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===2009: Conference champions===\n{{Main|2009 Indianapolis Colts season}}\n{{See also|Super Bowl XLIV}}\n[[File:Peyton Manning huddle.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The Colts offense huddles during a 2009 game against [[2009 Jacksonville Jaguars season|the Jacksonville Jaguars]].]]\nThe 2009 offseason saw many changes in the Colts organization, most notably being the fact the Jim Caldwell assumed the duties of head coach following Tony Dungy's retirement, with [[Clyde Christensen]] being promoted to offensive coordinator. The 2009 season also marked the twelfth season that Peyton Manning was the starting quarterback for the Colts.\n\nIndianapolis began the season with their best mark as a franchise in 2009: the Colts set new records by winning their first 14 games, including a come\u2013from\u2013behind victory over the Patriots after a controversial 4th and 2 play. During the season Peyton Manning was sacked only ten times and Indianapolis had the opportunity to repeat New England's 16\u20130 2007 record. However, during the week sixteen matchup against the New York Jets, Jim Caldwell decided to pull the starting line, allowing their opponent an easy win. Caldwell, along with team president Bill Polian, suffered a barrage of attacks from Colts fans and football experts for letting the team's chance at a perfect season get away.<ref>{{cite web|title=16\u20130 didn\u2019t matter|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/football/nfl/2009/12/27/colts_lose/|publisher=SportsNet|accessdate=July 4, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229163109/http://www.sportsnet.ca/football/nfl/2009/12/27/colts_lose/|archive-date=December 29, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kirschner|first=Kris|title=Colts fans furious over decision to pull starters|url=http://www.wthr.com/global/story.asp?s=11737675|publisher=WTHR|accessdate=July 4, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323195628/http://www.wthr.com/global/story.asp?s=11737675|archive-date=March 23, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Despite benching their starters, the Colts finished the season with a 14\u20132 record, matching 2005 for the most wins, and earned the number one seed in the AFC for [[2009\u201310 NFL playoffs|the playoffs]], while Manning also earned his fourth NFL MVP award.\n\nThe Colts faced the Baltimore Ravens in the divisional round and easily defeated them 20\u20133. Meanwhile, the Jets had made a completely unexpected playoff run by defeating Cincinnati and San Diego and thus engaged the Colts in a rematch for the conference title. Running at full strength, Indianapolis handily defeated the Jets in the AFC Championship Game, 30\u201317, to make their second Super Bowl trip in three years. The Colts met [[2009 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]] in Miami for Super Bowl XLIV, both teams the number-one seeds from their respective conferences. Despite a 10\u20130 lead in the first quarter, New Orleans managed to catch up, due in part to an onside kick after half time. The game was decided in the fourth quarter on a Peyton Manning interception thrown to Saints cornerback [[Tracy Porter]], which was returned for a touchdown. Inconsistent play and mistakes by the team sank their chances at another championship, with the Saints defeating the Colts 31\u201317.\n\n===2010===\n{{Main|2010 Indianapolis Colts season}}\nFollowing the Colts\u2019 Super Bowl loss, the organization continued to rebuild and bring in quality players to counter the many veterans on the team. The 2010 season began with a stunning upset defeat in Houston, where [[2010 Houston Texans season|the Texans]] beat them 34\u201324 and poor offensive line performance caused Peyton Manning to take several hits. The next week, the Colts hosted the Giants in the second \u201cManning Bowl\u201d, and as in 2006, Peyton easily overpowered his brother's team to win 38\u201314. However, the remainder of the season was filled with injuries and inconsistent play, with the Colts having, at one point, a 6\u20136 record, ending their streak of seven consecutive seasons with 12 or more victories. Nonetheless, the team was able to win its final four games, including a week seventeen match\u2013up with the Titans, to clinch their second straight AFC South title and fourteenth division title overall. They also clinched their ninth consecutive postseason appearance, tying the all-time record for consecutive postseason appearances by a team with the Dallas Cowboys, who made the playoffs every season between 1975 and 1983. Indianapolis entered the playoffs as the number three seed and faced the New York Jets again, this time in [[2009\u201310 NFL playoffs|the Wild Card round]]. A back and forth game ended with controversial play calling from head coach Jim Caldwell and a last\u2013second field goal by the Jets again ended the Colts\u2019 season short of a Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bishop|first=Greg|title=Jets Narrowly Escape Manning and the Colts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/09/sports/football/09jets.html|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012|date=January 8, 2011}}</ref> Following the game, Peyton Manning became the focus of controversy because of his advancing age, 35 at the time, and surgery for a herniated neck disc.\n\n===2011: Manning injury===\n{{Main|2011 Indianapolis Colts season}}\nIndianapolis went into the 2011 season with many questions not only about Peyton Manning's health but also his contract status. Manning signed an extension before the beginning of the season, but his availability for the season was in question due to surgery. The league was faced with a lockout from March to July that prevented Manning from using team training facilities to help recover, and when the preseason began he was left on the \u201c[[Physically Unable to Perform]]\u201d list. Originally ruled out for the season opener in Houston, Manning was eventually sidelined for the entire season due to multiple surgeries on his neck.<ref>{{cite web|title=Peyton Manning reportedly has new surgery, out 2-3 months|url=http://nfl.si.com/2011/09/08/jim-irsay-peyton-manning-out-for-awhile/|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202164505/http://nfl.si.com/2011/09/08/jim-irsay-peyton-manning-out-for-awhile/|archivedate=February 2, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Veteran quarterback [[Kerry Collins]] was signed to the team early in the year due to the dissatisfaction with backup quarterbacks [[Curtis Painter]] and [[Dan Orlovsky]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Kerry Collins joins Colts|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/6891243/indianapolis-colts-add-kerry-collins-sources-doubt-peyton-manning-ready|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=July 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\nFor the first time since 1997, the Colts were not commanded by Peyton Manning and instead were led by Collins in a 34\u20137 loss against the Texans. The season continued to spiral without Manning and the team was quickly 0\u20133 and was forced to start Curtis Painter following an injury to Kerry Collins. The Colts continued to look abysmal under Painter with the team going 0\u201311, including a 62\u20137 loss to the Saints, before Dan Orlovsky was put in to replace Painter at New England. Orlovsky led an effort to beat the Patriots, but the Colts fell to them 31\u201324, to go 0\u201312 on the season. After much media speculation they would equal [[2008 Detroit Lions season|the 2008 Lions]]\u2019 ignominy of losing all sixteen games, the Colts finally won at home against the Titans and the Texans in Weeks 15 and 16, so that they finished with a 2\u201314 record, which was still the second-worst in the Indianapolis era. This record ensured the Colts the number one overall pick in the [[2012 NFL Draft]] and began to stir up controversy over Peyton Manning\u2019s continued presence within the organization.\n\nThe Peyton Manning era came to an end on March 8, 2012 when Jim Irsay announced that Manning was officially being released from the roster after thirteen seasons.<ref name=\"Manning Released\">{{cite web|title=Manning Era Over|url=http://coltsmonkey.com/its-official-peyton-mannings-career-as-a-colt-is-over/|publisher=ColtsMonkey.com|accessdate=June 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006143833/http://coltsmonkey.com/its-official-peyton-mannings-career-as-a-colt-is-over/|archive-date=October 6, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Although Manning\u2019s medical condition and throwing strength continued to improve, Irsay stated that the Colts were embarking on \u201can ambitious rebuilding project\u201d and that due to Manning's age, 36, it was unlikely that he could win another Super Bowl before the rebuilding project was finished.

Manning struggled, completing 26 of 46 passes for 211 yards and consistently overthrowing receivers on deep routes. The Broncos could only convert 25 percent of their third-down attempts. The game played out much like the Colts' defeat of the Bengals a week earlier: taking a small lead at halftime before extending that lead in the second half. The Colts defeated the Broncos 24\u201313, marking Peyton Manning's ninth one-and-done loss in the playoffs, seven of which came when he helmed the Colts. It also marked Andrew Luck's third postseason victory, a milestone Manning didn't reach until his seventh year in the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|title=Game Center: Colts at Broncos|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2015011101/2014/POST19/colts@broncos#menu=gameinfo%7CcontentId%3A0ap3000000457739&tab=recap|publisher=NFL.com|accessdate=October 8, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIndianapolis moved on to once again face [[2014 New England Patriots season|the New England Patriots]] in the AFC Championship game.

The Patriots went on to defeat [[2014 Seattle Seahawks season|the Seattle Seahawks]] in [[Super Bowl XLIX]]. The defeat marked the Colts' sixth straight loss to the Patriots \u2014 not having won since the 2009 \u201c4th and 2\u201d game \u2014 and Andrew Luck's fourth failure in as many tries to defeat New England.

Gilbert regained the title in October 1998 at the [[NWA Anniversary Show#1998|NWA Anniversary Show]]. In November 1998, Richards joined [[Maryland Championship Wrestling]], winning the MCW Tag Team Championship with Earl the Pearl in his debut match. The duo held the titles until February 1999. In April 1999, Richards won an eight-man tournament for the vacant NWA 2000 Heavyweight Championship. At the independent supercard [[Break the Barrier]] on May 15, 1999, Richards won the APWF Heavyweight Championship, which he held until August 1999.\n\nRichards planned on retiring from professional wrestling to study [[information technology]] at the [[Community College of Philadelphia]].

He debuted on the August 15, 1999 episode of ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'', helping his old bWo partner, [[The Blue Meanie]], win a match against [[Al Snow]]. The two formed a short-lived tag team, before Richards adopted an impersonator gimmick.\n\nMocking other wrestler's gimmicks, he appeared as an [[The Acolytes|Acolyte]], a [[The Dudley Boyz|Dudley Boy]] and a vampire of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]], until briefly settling on [[Mick Foley]]'s Dude Love persona. After that, he impersonated [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], [[Chyna]], and [[Chris Jericho]], before being sidelined by an ankle injury. He returned to wrestle matches on [[WWE Jakked/Metal|''Jakked'' and ''Metal'']], where he lost more often than not. He challenged both [[Dean Malenko]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net//?id=1&nr=15906|title=WWF Jakked #36 \u00ab Events Database \u00ab CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|website=www.cagematch.net}}</ref> and [[Scotty 2 Hotty]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cagematch.net//?id=1&nr=27425|title=Gary Albright Memorial Show \u00ab Events Database \u00ab CAGEMATCH - The Internet Wrestling Database|website=www.cagematch.net}}</ref> for the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]] in this period, unsuccessfully.\n\nAfter [[Sable (wrestler)|Sable]] left the WWF, Richards and The Blue Meanie filmed a series of vignettes lampooning her titled \"The Blonde Bytch Project\" (a parody of [[The Blair Witch Project]]).

Over the next few weeks, he cut promos condemning the risqu\u00e9 content of WWF programming and preaching conservative values (the gimmick was a mocking reference to the [[Parents Television Council]], which was publicly criticizing WWF content at the time). He became a full-fledged [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], formalized his name to \"Steven Richards\" and formed a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] known as the [[Right to Censor]]. He spoke for, managed and tag teamed with his recruits: [[Godfather (wrestler)|The Godfather]] (renamed the Goodfather), [[Bull Buchanan]], [[Ivory (wrestler)|Ivory]], and [[Val Venis]]. When [[Chyna]] was featured in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Right to Censor objected, and feuded with her and her (onscreen) boyfriend, [[Eddie Guerrero]].\n\n====Stevie Night Heat (2001\u20132004)====\n[[Image:Stevierichards.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Richards in March 2003]]\nAfter Right to Censor broke up, Richards disappeared from TV for a short time. He returned to ''SmackDown!'' to cut a promo condemning [[The Undertaker]] for attacking Right to Censor and causing it to disband. When The Undertaker confronted Richards, [[KroniK]] attacked him. Richards announced his alliance with the WCW tag team, thus becoming a de facto member of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]. He managed Kronik in a match against The Undertaker and [[Glen Jacobs|Kane]], after which Kronik was released from the WWF.\n\nRichards then appeared mainly on the \"B shows\", ''Jakked'' and ''Metal'', until Team Alliance lost at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] in 2001. Richards was then fired (in storylines) along with the rest of the Alliance roster by [[Vince McMahon]]. [[Ric Flair]] was able to save his job and get him drafted to the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand.\n\nThere, he became a twenty-two-time Hardcore Champion, trading it several times with [[Mark LoMonaco|Bubba Ray Dudley]], [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]], [[Crash Holly]], [[Shawn Stasiak]], [[Peter Polaco|Justin Credible]], [[John Layfield|Bradshaw]], [[Terri Runnels|Terri]], and [[Tommy Dreamer]].<ref name=core />\n\nRichards formed an alliance with [[Lisa Marie Varon|Victoria]] in late 2002, as a mentally unbalanced couple helping each other win their matches. He often helped her retain the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWE Women's Championship]]. This led to a feud with Bubba Ray Dudley and Trish Stratus, who would win their titles in a tag team match on RAW. As Victoria turned [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]], the duo quietly separated.\n\nAround this time, he proclaimed himself \"General Manager of ''Heat''\", a title which carried no actual authority. In August 2004, Richards began appearing in drag as \"The Mystery Woman\" during Victoria's matches, helping her win.<ref name=ih115>Ian Hamilton.

After healing, Richards faced Masters in a rematch, but lost again.\n\nRichards appeared at the ECW reunion event, ''[[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]]'' in 2005, reuniting with his bWo comrades and proclaiming \"We have only three words for you. We're taking over!\" He then dropped The Sandman with a Stevie Kick.\n\nRichards was traded to [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] on June 30, 2005, and reformed the bWo with [[Mike Bucci|Nova]] and The Blue Meanie. At ''[[The Great American Bash (2005)|The Great American Bash]]'', the bWo lost to [[The Mexicools]] ([[Juventud Guerrera]], [[Psicosis]], and [[Super Crazy]]) in a six-man tag team match.\n\nRichards then had a short stint on ''[[WWE Velocity]]'', dropping the bWo gimmick as he lost to [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]] and [[Booker Huffman|Booker T]]. After September 6, he disappeared from TV for over six months. He returned for an 18-Man interpromotional [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]] at [[WrestleMania 22]].\n\n====ECW (2006\u20132008)====\nShortly after the introduction of the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]] in 2006, Richards left the SmackDown! brand to join it on the \"WWE vs ECW Head to Head\" show on June 7, 2006. He wrestled on ECW's weekly show under his old [[ring name]] of Stevie Richards. He soon returned to his [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] persona, turning on the other [[ECW Originals]] and siding with the newer stars. His first win on ECW's weekly show was on September 5, 2006, over [[Balls Mahoney]], after interference from [[Kevin Fertig|Kevin Thorn]], who was feuding with Mahoney at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/ecw/archive/09052006/|title=D-Generation extreme|date=September 5, 2006|author=Jen Hunt|accessdate=2008-01-03|publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]]}}</ref>\n\nRichards wrestled before the ECW brand's first pay-per-view, ''[[December to Dismember (2006)|December to Dismember]]'', defeating [[Ren\u00e9 Goguen|Rene Dupree]] in a dark match.<ref>{{cite web|title=December to Dismember 2006 results|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/december2dismember06.html|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2008-06-23}}</ref> Other than this match, he did not appear on ECW between September 2006 (when he joined up with the first version of ECW's [[New Breed (ECW)|New Breed]] - Test, Mike Knox and Hardcore Holly) and February 2007 (when he lost to [[CM Punk]] for a second time).\n\nRichards was a lumberjack in the pre-[[WrestleMania 23]] Lumberjack Tag Team match.

When Bangladesh became independent in 1971, activities were scaled down due to a scarcity of funds. Subsequently, a bilateral agreement was signed by Bangladesh and USAID for direct fund flow to the organisation. Until 1978, there were number research accomplishments such as ORS, Patho-Physiology of shigellosis, Rotavirus, uplifting family planning program etc.  In 1978 proposal by an international group of scientists was put forward to elevate the organisation to an international research centre. The organisation was established in its current form via an ordinance promulgated by the President and then that was ratified in parliament in 1979. The Centre has, among its other accomplishments, played a major role in the discovery and implementation of [[oral rehydration therapy]] for the treatment of [[diarrhoea]] and [[cholera]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/joral.htm |title=ORS: The medical advance of the century |author=UNICEF |accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> Oral rehydration therapy is thought to have saved over 50 million people worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28564607|title=The man who helped save 50 million lives|last=Ginzberg|first=Lin Lin|date=3 August 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=6 August 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nSince 1978, the Centre has trained more than 27,000 health professionals from over 78 countries.

When Bangladesh became independent in 1971, activities were scaled down due to a scarcity of funds. Subsequently, a bilateral agreement was signed by Bangladesh and USAID for direct fund flow to the organisation. Until 1978, there were number research accomplishments such as ORS, Patho-Physiology of shigellosis, Rotavirus, uplifting family planning program etc.  In 1978 proposal by an international group of scientists was put forward to elevate the organisation to an international research centre. The organisation was established in its current form via an ordinance promulgated by the President and then that was ratified in parliament in 1979. The Centre has, among its other accomplishments, played a major role in the discovery and implementation of [[oral rehydration therapy]] for the treatment of [[diarrhoea]] and [[cholera]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc96/joral.htm |title=ORS: The medical advance of the century |author=UNICEF |accessdate=1 May 2011}}</ref> Oral rehydration therapy is thought to have saved over 50 million people worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-28564607|title=The man who helped save 50 million lives|last=Ginzberg|first=Lin Lin|date=3 August 2014|work=BBC News|access-date=6 August 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nSince 1978, the Centre has trained more than 27,000 health professionals from over 78 countries. Courses provide practical training in hospital management of [[diarrhoeal diseases]], [[epidemiology]], [[biostatistics]], [[family planning]], demographic surveillance, and child survival strategies. As child deaths from disease have been reduced, deaths from injuries, such as drowning, have become a proportionately greater threat to child survival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icddrb.org/component/content/article/10030-news/2068-drowning-kills-more-children-aged-1-to-4-than-any-disease |title=Drowning kills more children aged 1 to 4 than any disease |website=icddr,b}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nIn 2017, icddr,b won the Conrad N.

However, some would claim that divination is indeed practiced in the Bible, such as in Exodus 28, when the [[Urim and Thummim]] are mentioned. Some would also say that [[Gideon]] also practiced divination, though when he uses a piece of fleece or wool in {{bibleref2|Judges|6:36-40}}, he is not attempting to predict the outcome of an important battle; rather, he is communicating with [[Yahweh|God]]. Communicating with God through prayer may in some cases be considered divination; both are open, typically two-way conversations with God. In addition, the method of \"casting lots\" used in {{bibleref2|Joshua|14:1-5}} and {{bibleref2|Joshua|18:1-10}} to divide the conquered lands of [[Canaan]] between the twelve tribes is not seen by some as divination, but as done at the behest of God ({{bibleref2|Numbers 26:55}}).\n\n{{See also|Oracle|Greek divination}}\nBoth oracles and seers in ancient Greece practiced divination. [[Oracle#Greece|Oracles]] were the conduits for the gods on earth; their prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim. Because of the high demand for oracle consultations and the oracles\u2019 limited work schedule, they were not the main source of divination for the ancient Greeks. That role fell to the seers (''\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2'' in Greek).{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nSeers were not in direct contact with the gods; instead, they were interpreters of signs provided by the gods. Seers used many methods to explicate the will of the gods including [[extispicy]], bird signs, etc. They were more numerous than the oracles and did not keep a limited schedule; thus, they were highly valued by all Greeks, not just those with the capacity to travel to Delphi or other such distant sites.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe disadvantage to seers was that only direct yes-or-no questions could be answered. Oracles could answer more generalized questions, and seers often had to perform several sacrifices in order to get the most consistent answer. For example, if a general wanted to know if the omens were proper for him to advance on the enemy, he would ask his seer both that question and if it were better for him to remain on the defensive. If the seer gave consistent answers, the advice was considered valid.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt battle, generals would frequently ask seers at both the [[campground]] (a process called the ''hiera'') and at the [[battle]]field (called the ''sphagia''). The hiera entailed the seer slaughtering a sheep and examining its liver for answers regarding a more generic question; the sphagia involved killing a young female goat by slitting its throat and noting the animal's last movements and blood flow. The battlefield sacrifice only occurred when two armies prepared for battle against each other. Neither force would advance until the seer revealed appropriate [[omen]]s.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nBecause the seers had such power over influential individuals in ancient Greece, many were skeptical of the accuracy and honesty of the seers. The degree to which seers were honest depends entirely on the individual seers. Despite the doubt surrounding individual seers, the craft as a whole was well regarded and trusted by the Greeks.<ref>Flower, Michael Attyah. ''The Seer in Ancient Greece.'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008.</ref>\n\n===Middle Ages and Early Modern period===\n{{see|Medieval magic|Renaissance magic|Folk Catholicism}}\nThe divination method of casting lots ([[Cleromancy]]) was used by the remaining eleven disciples of Jesus in {{bibleref2|Acts|1:23-26}} to select a replacement for [[Judas Iscariot]]. Therefore, divination was arguably an accepted practice in the early church. However, divination became viewed as a pagan practice by Christian [[emperor]]s during [[ancient Rome]].<ref>Bailey, Michael David. (2007). ''Magic and Superstition in Europe''.

Many [[Aztec religion|Aztec gods]], including central [[creator deity|creator gods]], were described as diviners and were closely associated with [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]]. [[Tezcatlipoca]] is the patron of sorcerers and practitioners of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. His name means \"smoking mirror\", a reference to a device used for divinatory [[scrying]].<ref name=\"Miller 2007\">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Mary|title=Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico|year=2007|publisher=Thames & Hudson|location=London}}</ref> In the [[Maya mythology|Mayan]] ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the creator gods [[Xmucane and Xpiacoc]] perform divinatory hand casting during the creation of people.<ref name=\"Miller 2007\"/>\n\nEvery civilization that developed in [[pre-Columbian Mexico]], from the [[Olmecs]] to the [[Aztecs]], practiced divination in daily life, both public and private. Scrying through the use of reflective water surfaces, [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirrors]], or the [[Cleromancy|casting of lots]] were among the most widespread forms of divinatory practice. [[Vision (spirituality)|Vision]]s derived from [[hallucinogens]] were another important form of divination, and are still widely used among contemporary diviners of Mexico.

This concept may be referred to as [[syncretism]], [[creolization]], or [[cultural hybridity]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Laura|date=2017|title=Japanese Tarot Cards|journal=ASIANetwork Exchange: A Journal for Asian Studies in the Liberal Arts|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1\u201328|doi=10.16995/ane.244}}</ref> In the example of feng shui, Japanese adaptations of feng shui extend outside the traditional form, featuring such hybrids as \"car feng shui,\" \"workplace feng shui,\" \"makeup feng shui,\" and even \"toilet feng shui.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== Personality types =====\nPersonality typing as a form of divination has been prevalent in Japan since the 1980s. Various methods exist for divining personality type. Each attempt to reveal glimpses of an individual's destiny, productive and inhibiting traits, future parenting technique, and compatibility in marriage. Personality type is increasingly important for young Japanese, who consider personality the driving factor of compatibility, given the ongoing marriage drought and [[Birthrate decline|birth rate decline]] in Japan.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAn import to Japan, [[Chinese zodiac]] signs based on birth year in 12 year cycles (rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, cock, dog, and boar) are frequently combined with other forms of divination, such as so-called 'celestial types' based on the planets (Saturn, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, or Uranus). Personality can also be divined using cardinal directions, the [[Classical element|four elements]] (water, earth, fire, air), and [[Yin and yang|yin-yang]]. Names can also lend important personality information under name classification which asserts that names bearing certain Japanese vowel sounds (a, i, u, e, o) share common characteristics. [[Numerology]], which utilizes methods of diving 'birth numbers' from significant numbers such as birth date, may also reveal character traits of individuals.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIndividuals can also assess their own and others' personalities according to physical characteristics. [[Blood type]] remains a popular form of divination from physiology. Stemming from Western influences, body reading or ''ninsou'', determines personality traits based on body measurements. The face is the most commonly analyzed feature, with eye size, pupil shape, mouth shape, and eyebrow shape representing the most important traits. An upturned mouth may be cheerful, and a triangle eyebrow may indicate that someone is strong-willed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMethods of assessment in daily life may include self-taken measurements or quizzes. As such, magazines targeted at women in their early-to-mid twenties feature the highest concentration of personality assessment guides. There are approximately 144 different women's magazines, known as ''nihon zashi koukoku kyoukai'', published in Japan aimed at this audience.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Laura|date=1997|title=People Types: Personality Classification in Japanese Women's Magazines|url=https://www.academia.edu/28155359|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|volume=31|issue=2|pages=143\u2013159|via=Academia.edu|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1997.00143.x}}</ref>\n\n===== Japanese tarot =====\nThe adaptation of the Western divination method of tarot cards into Japanese culture presents a particularly unique example of contemporary divination as this adaptation mingles with Japan's robust visual culture. Japanese tarot cards are created by professional artists, advertisers, and fans of tarot. One tarot card collector claimed to have accumulated more than 1,500 Japan-made decks of tarot cards. Japanese tarot cards fall into diverse categories such as Inspiration Tarot (''reikan tarotto''), I-Ching Tarot (''ekisen tarotto''), Spiritual Tarot (''supirichuaru tarotto''), Western Tarot (''seiy\u014d tarotto''), and Eastern Tarot (''t\u014dy\u014d tarotto''). The images on tarot cards may come from images from Japanese popular culture, such as characters from [[manga]] and [[anime]] including [[Hello Kitty]], or may feature cultural symbols. Tarot cards may adapt the images of Japanese historical figures, such as high priestess [[Himiko]] (170-248CE) or imperial court wizard [[Abe no Seimei]] (921-1005CE) . Still others may feature images of cultural displacement, such as English knights, [[pentagram]]s, the Jewish [[Torah]], or invented [[glyph]]<nowiki/>s. The introduction of such cards began by the 1930s and reached prominence 1970s. Japanese tarot cards were originally created by men, often based on the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot published by the Rider company in London in 1909.<ref name=\":1\" /> Since, the practice of Japanese tarot has become overwhelmingly feminine and intertwined with [[kawaii]] culture. Referring to the cuteness of tarot cards, Japanese model Kuromiya Niina was quoted as saying \"because the images are cute, even holding them is enjoyable.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Laura|date=May 2011|title=Tantalizing Tarot and Cute Cartomancy in Japan|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254312114|journal=Japanese Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=73\u201391|doi=10.1080/10371397.2011.560659|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> While these differences exist, Japanese tarot cards function similarly to their Western counterparts. Cards are shuffled and cut into piles then used to forecast the future, for spiritual reflection, or as a tool for self-understanding.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Taiwan====\nAs seen previous to this section, many different cultures around the world use divination as a way of understanding the future. The most common act of divination in the Bao\u2019an village in Taiwan is called the Poe, Bao\u2019an is not the actual name of the village, but for privacy purposes that is what it will be called. The Poe translated to English means \u201cmoon boards\u201d. The Poe consists of two wood or bamboo blocks cut into the shape of a crescent moon. The one edge is rounded while the other is flat; the two are mirror images. Both crescents are held out in one's palms and while kneeling, they are raised to the forehead level. Once in this position the blocks are dropped and the future can be understood depending on their landing. If both fall flat side up or both fall rounded side up, that can be taken as a failure of the deity to agree. If the blocks land one rounded and one flat, the deity agrees. \u201cLaughing poe\u201d is when rounded sides land down and they rock before coming to a standstill. \u201cNegative poe\u201d is seen when the flat sides fall downward and abruptly stop, this indicates anger. When there is a positive fall, is called \u201csacred poe\u201d, although the negative falls are not usually taken seriously. As the blocks are being dropped the question is said in a murmur, and if the answer is yes, the blocks are dropped again. To make sure the answer is definitely a yes, the blocks must fall in a \u201cyes\u201d position three times in a row.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n \nA more serious type of divination is the Ki\u014d-\u00e1. There is a small wooden chair, and around the sides of the chair are small pieces of wood that can move up and down in their sockets, this causes a clicking sounds when the chair is moved in any way. Two men hold this chair by its legs before an altar, during this incense are being burned, and the supernatural agent is asked to descend into the chair. It is seen that it is in the chair by an onset of motion. Eventually the chair crashes onto a table prepared with wood chips and burlap. The characters on the table are then traced and these are said to be written by the god who possessed the chair, these characters are then interpreted.<ref>Rohsenow, Hill Gates, and David K.

If a distinction is to be made between divination and [[fortune-telling]], divination has a more formal or ritualistic element and often contains a more social character, usually in a [[religion|religious]] context, as seen in [[traditional African medicine]].

However, some would claim that divination is indeed practiced in the Bible, such as in Exodus 28, when the [[Urim and Thummim]] are mentioned. Some would also say that [[Gideon]] also practiced divination, though when he uses a piece of fleece or wool in {{bibleref2|Judges|6:36-40}}, he is not attempting to predict the outcome of an important battle; rather, he is communicating with [[Yahweh|God]]. Communicating with God through prayer may in some cases be considered divination; both are open, typically two-way conversations with God. In addition, the method of \"casting lots\" used in {{bibleref2|Joshua|14:1-5}} and {{bibleref2|Joshua|18:1-10}} to divide the conquered lands of [[Canaan]] between the twelve tribes is not seen by some as divination, but as done at the behest of God ({{bibleref2|Numbers 26:55}}).\n\n{{See also|Oracle|Greek divination}}\nBoth oracles and seers in ancient Greece practiced divination. [[Oracle#Greece|Oracles]] were the conduits for the gods on earth; their prophecies were understood to be the will of the gods verbatim. Because of the high demand for oracle consultations and the oracles\u2019 limited work schedule, they were not the main source of divination for the ancient Greeks. That role fell to the seers (''\u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2'' in Greek).{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nSeers were not in direct contact with the gods; instead, they were interpreters of signs provided by the gods. Seers used many methods to explicate the will of the gods including [[extispicy]], bird signs, etc. They were more numerous than the oracles and did not keep a limited schedule; thus, they were highly valued by all Greeks, not just those with the capacity to travel to Delphi or other such distant sites.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe disadvantage to seers was that only direct yes-or-no questions could be answered. Oracles could answer more generalized questions, and seers often had to perform several sacrifices in order to get the most consistent answer. For example, if a general wanted to know if the omens were proper for him to advance on the enemy, he would ask his seer both that question and if it were better for him to remain on the defensive. If the seer gave consistent answers, the advice was considered valid.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nAt battle, generals would frequently ask seers at both the [[campground]] (a process called the ''hiera'') and at the [[battle]]field (called the ''sphagia''). The hiera entailed the seer slaughtering a sheep and examining its liver for answers regarding a more generic question; the sphagia involved killing a young female goat by slitting its throat and noting the animal's last movements and blood flow. The battlefield sacrifice only occurred when two armies prepared for battle against each other. Neither force would advance until the seer revealed appropriate [[omen]]s.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nBecause the seers had such power over influential individuals in ancient Greece, many were skeptical of the accuracy and honesty of the seers. The degree to which seers were honest depends entirely on the individual seers. Despite the doubt surrounding individual seers, the craft as a whole was well regarded and trusted by the Greeks.<ref>Flower, Michael Attyah. ''The Seer in Ancient Greece.''

His name means \"smoking mirror\", a reference to a device used for divinatory [[scrying]].<ref name=\"Miller 2007\">{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Mary|title=Gods and Symbols of Ancient Mexico|year=2007|publisher=Thames & Hudson|location=London}}</ref> In the [[Maya mythology|Mayan]] ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', the creator gods [[Xmucane and Xpiacoc]] perform divinatory hand casting during the creation of people.<ref name=\"Miller 2007\"/>\n\nEvery civilization that developed in [[pre-Columbian Mexico]], from the [[Olmecs]] to the [[Aztecs]], practiced divination in daily life, both public and private. Scrying through the use of reflective water surfaces, [[Mirrors in Mesoamerican culture|mirrors]], or the [[Cleromancy|casting of lots]] were among the most widespread forms of divinatory practice. [[Vision (spirituality)|Vision]]s derived from [[hallucinogens]] were another important form of divination, and are still widely used among contemporary diviners of Mexico. Among the more common [[hallucinogenic plants]] used in divination are [[morning glory]], [[jimson weed]], and [[peyote]].<ref name=\"Miller 2007\"/>\n\n==Contemporary folk religion==\n===Asia===\n==== Japan ====\n\nAlthough Japan retains a history of traditional and local methods of divination, such as [[Onmy\u014dd\u014d|omyodo]], contemporary divination in Japan, called ''uranai'', derives from outside sources.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Laura|date=2014|title=The divination arts in girl culture|url=https://www.academia.edu/25806189|journal=Capturing Contemporary Japan: Differentiation and Uncertainty|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|volume=|pages=334\u2013358|via=Academia}}</ref> Contemporary methods of divination in Japan include both Western and Chinese [[astrology]], [[geomancy]] or [[feng shui]], [[Tarot|tarot cards]], [[I Ching]] (Book of Changes), and [[physiognomy]] (methods of reading the body to identify traits).<ref name=\":0\" /> Rather than indicate [[cultural appropriation]], understood as inappropriate acts of appropriation by a dominant culture in the context of colonization or inequality, Japanese divination represents instances of unique and creative amalgamation of cultural elements. This concept may be referred to as [[syncretism]], [[creolization]], or [[cultural hybridity]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Laura|date=2017|title=Japanese Tarot Cards|journal=ASIANetwork Exchange: A Journal for Asian Studies in the Liberal Arts|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1\u201328|doi=10.16995/ane.244}}</ref> In the example of feng shui, Japanese adaptations of feng shui extend outside the traditional form, featuring such hybrids as \"car feng shui,\" \"workplace feng shui,\" \"makeup feng shui,\" and even \"toilet feng shui.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===== Personality types =====\nPersonality typing as a form of divination has been prevalent in Japan since the 1980s. Various methods exist for divining personality type. Each attempt to reveal glimpses of an individual's destiny, productive and inhibiting traits, future parenting technique, and compatibility in marriage. Personality type is increasingly important for young Japanese, who consider personality the driving factor of compatibility, given the ongoing marriage drought and [[Birthrate decline|birth rate decline]] in Japan.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAn import to Japan, [[Chinese zodiac]] signs based on birth year in 12 year cycles (rat, ox, tiger, hare, dragon, snake, horse, sheep, monkey, cock, dog, and boar) are frequently combined with other forms of divination, such as so-called 'celestial types' based on the planets (Saturn, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Mercury, or Uranus). Personality can also be divined using cardinal directions, the [[Classical element|four elements]] (water, earth, fire, air), and [[Yin and yang|yin-yang]]. Names can also lend important personality information under name classification which asserts that names bearing certain Japanese vowel sounds (a, i, u, e, o) share common characteristics. [[Numerology]], which utilizes methods of diving 'birth numbers' from significant numbers such as birth date, may also reveal character traits of individuals.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIndividuals can also assess their own and others' personalities according to physical characteristics. [[Blood type]] remains a popular form of divination from physiology. Stemming from Western influences, body reading or ''ninsou'', determines personality traits based on body measurements. The face is the most commonly analyzed feature, with eye size, pupil shape, mouth shape, and eyebrow shape representing the most important traits. An upturned mouth may be cheerful, and a triangle eyebrow may indicate that someone is strong-willed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nMethods of assessment in daily life may include self-taken measurements or quizzes. As such, magazines targeted at women in their early-to-mid twenties feature the highest concentration of personality assessment guides. There are approximately 144 different women's magazines, known as ''nihon zashi koukoku kyoukai'', published in Japan aimed at this audience.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Laura|date=1997|title=People Types: Personality Classification in Japanese Women's Magazines|url=https://www.academia.edu/28155359|journal=The Journal of Popular Culture|volume=31|issue=2|pages=143\u2013159|via=Academia.edu|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.1997.00143.x}}</ref>\n\n===== Japanese tarot =====\nThe adaptation of the Western divination method of tarot cards into Japanese culture presents a particularly unique example of contemporary divination as this adaptation mingles with Japan's robust visual culture. Japanese tarot cards are created by professional artists, advertisers, and fans of tarot. One tarot card collector claimed to have accumulated more than 1,500 Japan-made decks of tarot cards. Japanese tarot cards fall into diverse categories such as Inspiration Tarot (''reikan tarotto''), I-Ching Tarot (''ekisen tarotto''), Spiritual Tarot (''supirichuaru tarotto''), Western Tarot (''seiy\u014d tarotto''), and Eastern Tarot (''t\u014dy\u014d tarotto''). The images on tarot cards may come from images from Japanese popular culture, such as characters from [[manga]] and [[anime]] including [[Hello Kitty]], or may feature cultural symbols. Tarot cards may adapt the images of Japanese historical figures, such as high priestess [[Himiko]] (170-248CE) or imperial court wizard [[Abe no Seimei]] (921-1005CE) . Still others may feature images of cultural displacement, such as English knights, [[pentagram]]s, the Jewish [[Torah]], or invented [[glyph]]<nowiki/>s. The introduction of such cards began by the 1930s and reached prominence 1970s. Japanese tarot cards were originally created by men, often based on the Rider-Waite-Smith tarot published by the Rider company in London in 1909.<ref name=\":1\" /> Since, the practice of Japanese tarot has become overwhelmingly feminine and intertwined with [[kawaii]] culture. Referring to the cuteness of tarot cards, Japanese model Kuromiya Niina was quoted as saying \"because the images are cute, even holding them is enjoyable.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Laura|date=May 2011|title=Tantalizing Tarot and Cute Cartomancy in Japan|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254312114|journal=Japanese Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=73\u201391|doi=10.1080/10371397.2011.560659|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> While these differences exist, Japanese tarot cards function similarly to their Western counterparts. Cards are shuffled and cut into piles then used to forecast the future, for spiritual reflection, or as a tool for self-understanding.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Taiwan====\nAs seen previous to this section, many different cultures around the world use divination as a way of understanding the future. The most common act of divination in the Bao\u2019an village in Taiwan is called the Poe, Bao\u2019an is not the actual name of the village, but for privacy purposes that is what it will be called. The Poe translated to English means \u201cmoon boards\u201d. The Poe consists of two wood or bamboo blocks cut into the shape of a crescent moon. The one edge is rounded while the other is flat; the two are mirror images. Both crescents are held out in one's palms and while kneeling, they are raised to the forehead level. Once in this position the blocks are dropped and the future can be understood depending on their landing. If both fall flat side up or both fall rounded side up, that can be taken as a failure of the deity to agree. If the blocks land one rounded and one flat, the deity agrees. \u201cLaughing poe\u201d is when rounded sides land down and they rock before coming to a standstill. \u201cNegative poe\u201d is seen when the flat sides fall downward and abruptly stop, this indicates anger. When there is a positive fall, is called \u201csacred poe\u201d, although the negative falls are not usually taken seriously. As the blocks are being dropped the question is said in a murmur, and if the answer is yes, the blocks are dropped again. To make sure the answer is definitely a yes, the blocks must fall in a \u201cyes\u201d position three times in a row.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n \nA more serious type of divination is the Ki\u014d-\u00e1. There is a small wooden chair, and around the sides of the chair are small pieces of wood that can move up and down in their sockets, this causes a clicking sounds when the chair is moved in any way. Two men hold this chair by its legs before an altar, during this incense are being burned, and the supernatural agent is asked to descend into the chair. It is seen that it is in the chair by an onset of motion. Eventually the chair crashes onto a table prepared with wood chips and burlap. The characters on the table are then traced and these are said to be written by the god who possessed the chair, these characters are then interpreted.<ref>Rohsenow, Hill Gates, and David K.
