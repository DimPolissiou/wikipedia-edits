KAPL is responsible for the research, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of U.S. nuclear-powered warships. It also manages work on nuclear ships at numerous shipyards across the country.\n\n==History==\nOn May 15, 1946, KAPL began with a contract between General Electric and the U.S. Government to conduct nuclear research and development, including the generation of [[electricity]] from [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]]. In 1950, the nuclear power plant project was converted to a Naval Nuclear Propulsion project. Several years later Knolls' work joined that of [[Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory]], the [[Argonne National Laboratory]], and others in developing the world's first nuclear-powered [[submarine]], the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)|USS ''Nautilus'']] on January 21, 1954.\n\nIn 1952 and 1953, [[Jimmy Carter]], who would later become a US president, worked at KAPL as an engineer.\n\nThe [[Chart of the Nuclides]], containing information such as masses, relative abundances, half-lives, neutron cross sections, and decay properties for more than 3,100 [[nuclide]]s and 580 isomers was developed at KAPL.  This chart is a necessity for students and professionals in [[nuclear physics]], [[chemistry]], [[engineering]], and [[medicine]] around the world.  The Chart has been compiled, edited and periodically revised by KAPL scientists since 1956.\n\n==Today==\nKAPL operates two sites in New York, the Knolls site in [[Niskayuna, New York|Niskayuna]] and the Kenneth A. Kesselring site in [[Milton (town), New York|West Milton]].<ref name=\"KAPL Homepage\" />  Niskayuna is the primary site for the KAPL, focusing on the design and development of naval propulsion plants and reactor cores.  The West Milton site operates land-based prototypes of shipboard reactor plants. This site is also used to train officers and enlisted personnel for the U.S. Navy's fleet of nuclear-powered vessels.  KAPL employs more than 2,600 people <ref name=\"KAPL Homepage\" /> at these sites and others, mostly [[shipyard]]s in the states of [[California]], [[Connecticut]], [[Hawaii]], [[Maine]], [[Virginia]], and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].\n\nIn 2006 KAPL achieved full remediation of the [[S1C reactor|S1C]] Prototype Reactor site located in [[Windsor, Connecticut]]. The S1C site remedial action was declared to be complete by the Connecticut [[Department of Environmental Protection]] in October 2006. KAPL had taken over operation of the S1C Prototype in the 1960s after expiration of the Navy's original contract with [[Combustion Engineering]].\n\nKAPL, as well as [[Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory]], is managed and operated by Fluor Marine Propulsion Corporation, a subsidiary of [[Fluor Corporation]].

Knolls Atomic Power Lab'' (Docket 06-1505), was filed by 28 of 31 employees dismissed during downsizing at the lab in 1996. The Lab had instituted a voluntary buyout plan but could not attain the desired staff reduction. It developed a matrix to rank employees based on three factors: performance, flexibility and criticality of their jobs, and added points for years of service. All of the dismissed employees were at least 40 years old. \n\nTwenty-eight of those dismissed sued in January 1997 under the [[Age Discrimination in Employment Act]].  A jury found for the employees in December 2000, and judgment was rendered in 2002.  The Lab appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit]], but the judgment was upheld in 2004.  KAPL appealed again and, while its petition to the US Supreme Court was pending, a related case (''Smith v. City of Jackson'' [Docket 03-1160]) caused the Court in 2006 to vacate the judgment in favor of the defendants (Meacham II). \n\nThe 17 remaining plaintiffs (9 had settled their claims) petitioned the US Supreme Court, which ultimately ruled in their favor on technical grounds. The case was remanded to the 2nd Circuit Court, where the original judgment was finally reinstated in 2009 (Meacham III).<ref>{{cite web|title=Case 1:97-cv-00012-DRH Document 312|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-nynd-1_97-cv-00012/pdf/USCOURTS-nynd-1_97-cv-00012-0.pdf|publisher=United States Printing Office|accessdate=May 1, 2012|date=May 1, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Case 1:97-cv-00012-DRH Document 316|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-nynd-1_97-cv-00012/pdf/USCOURTS-nynd-1_97-cv-00012-1.pdf|publisher=United States Printing Office|accessdate=May 1, 2012|date=May 11, 2009}}</ref>   \n\nThe importance of this case stems from its conclusion that employers' actions or policies that appear reasonable and neutral but nevertheless have a disparate impact on older workers are discriminatory in practice.

They participated in the [[1916 Easter Rising]] but while \u00dana was imprisoned for a few days, Robert was sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted to penal servitude.<ref name=\"mc\"/> His continuing political activity resulted in further imprisonments in 1917 and 1920. Maeve was born while he was in prison. He was director of publicity for the [[Anti-Treaty IRA|anti-Treaty Irish Republican Army]] during the [[Irish Civil War]]. He also founded and was the director of ''[[The Irish Press]]'' newspaper.<ref name=\"mc\"/> His imprisonments and activities greatly fragmented Maeve Brennan's childhood. In her story ''The Day We Got Our Own Back'' she recounts her memory of how, when she was five, her home was raided by [[Irish Free State|Free State]] forces looking for her father, who was on the run.\n\nRobert Brennan was appointed the Irish Free State's first minister to the United States, and the family moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1934, when Maeve was seventeen. She attended the [[Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods|Sisters of Providence]] Catholic school in Washington, [[Immaculata Seminary]], graduating in 1936. She then graduated with a degree in English from [[American University]] in 1938.<ref name=\"homesick\">{{cite book | title=Maeve Brennan: Homesick at The New Yorker | publisher=Counterpoint Press | author=Bourke, Angela | year=2004 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/maevebrennanhome00bour/page/127 127\u2013128] | isbn=1582432295 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/maevebrennanhome00bour/page/127 }}</ref> Maeve and two of her sisters remained in the United States when her parents and brother returned to Ireland in 1944.<ref name=\"mc\"/>\n\n===Career===\nBrennan moved to New York and found work as a fashion copywriter at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' in the 1940s. She also wrote a Manhattan column for the Dublin society magazine ''Social and Personal'', and wrote several short pieces for ''The New Yorker'' magazine. In 1949, she was offered a staff job by [[William Shawn]], ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s managing editor.\n\nBrennan first wrote for ''The New Yorker'' as a social diarist. She wrote sketches about New York life in ''The Talk of the Town'' section under the pseudonym \"The Long-Winded Lady\". She also contributed fiction criticism, fashion notes, and essays. She wrote about both Ireland and the United States.<ref name=\"mc\"/>\n\n''The New Yorker'' began publishing Brennan's short stories in 1950. The first of these stories was called \"The Holy Terror\". In it, Mary Ramsay, a \"garrulous, greedy heap of a woman\" tries to keep her job as a ladies' room attendant in a Dublin hotel.\n\nBrennan's work was fostered by [[William Keepers Maxwell Jr.|William Maxwell]], and she wrote under ''The New Yorker'' managing editors [[Harold Ross]] and William Shawn. Although she was widely read in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, she was almost unknown in Ireland, even though Dublin was the setting of many of her short stories.\n\nA compendium of her ''New Yorker'' articles called ''The Long-Winded Lady: Notes from the New Yorker'' was published in 1969. Two collections of short stories, ''In and Out of Never-Never Land'' (1969) and ''Christmas Eve'' (1974) were also published.\n\n===Personal life===\nBrennan was admired in New York society for her intelligence, wit, beauty, and style. She was a petite woman who frequently dressed in black and liked wearing large, dark glasses. She was eccentric, and never lived in any place for a long period of time. She was generous with her money, but she also liked to buy extravagant things and tended to live beyond her means. She occasionally visited [[Ireland]], but was wary of Ireland's religious and conservative society.\n\nWhile the love of her life was reportedly the writer and theatre critic/director [[Walter Kerr]], he broke off their engagement and married writer [[Jean Kerr|Bridget Jean Collins]]<ref name=\"bio_karl\">{{cite book |last1=Karl |first1=Michaela |title=\"Ich w\u00fcrde so etwas nie ohne Lippenstift lesen.\": Maeve Brennan. Eine Biographie |date=2019 |publisher=Hoffmann und Campe |isbn=3455504140}}</ref>. In 1954, Brennan married [[St. Clair McKelway]], ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s managing editor. McKelway had a history of alcoholism, womanizing and manic depression and had already been divorced four times<ref name=\"bio_karl\"/>. Brennan and McKelway divorced after five years. Brennan also had a history with drinking. In the 1970's her drinking and state of mind worsened and she even became homeless at one point.\n\n[[Edward Albee]] greatly admired Brennan and compared her to Chekhov and Flaubert. One of the characters in his play ''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung'' is called \"Long-Winded Lady\". He dedicated the published editions of ''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung'' (1968) and ''Box'' (1968) to her.\n\nBrennan was writing consistently and productively in the late 1960s. By the time her first books were published, however, she was showing signs of mental illness. Her previously immaculate appearance became unkempt. Her friends began to find her eccentricities disturbing rather than entertaining. She became obsessive.\n\nIn the 1970s Brennan became paranoid and alcoholic. Hospitalized on numerous occasions, she became destitute and homeless, frequently sleeping in the women's lavatory at ''The New Yorker''. She was last seen at the magazine's offices in 1981.\n\nIn the 1980s, Brennan vanished from view and her work was forgotten. After wandering from one transient hotel to another along [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]], she was admitted to Lawrence Nursing Home in Arverne. She died of a heart attack on November 1, 1993, at the age of seventy-six and is buried in [[Queens, New York City]].\n\n==Works==\nBrennan's writing style in her \"Long-Winded Lady\" pieces and in her short stories are quite different both in style and content.\n\n===''The New Yorker'' articles===\nBrennan's contributions as \"The Long-Winded Lady\" in ''The New Yorker'' are sardonic observations of New York life. In them, Brennan mocks [[Manhattan]] society and social tradition, but in a humorous, wistful, and often melancholy manner. In these stories she is an observer eavesdropping on strangers' conversations in bars, diners, hotel lobbies, and streets in places like [[Times Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]].  She then embellishes her observations with speculations and autobiographical details. Brennan is always an onlooker in these sketches, never a participant. For example, she watches a street protest against the [[Vietnam War]] from a window, but does not venture out onto the street. A compendium of her articles was published in 1969.\n\n===Short stories===\nBrennan's short stories are written in a simple, direct, and elegant style. She writes with a minimum of characters and plot. Some of her stories are quietly tender and poignant while others are satirical. The characters are emotionally unreachable and often lead stagnant lives where everything remains much the same. She often repeats characters from story to story, for example, Hubert and Rose Derdon, whose marriage is examined over stories set years apart. In the final Derdon story, \"The Drowned Man\", Rose has died and Hubert has to pretend that he is overwhelmed with grief for his dead wife, \"... she was gone, she had been good, and he wished he could miss her.\"\n\nThe main themes in Brennan's short stories are feelings of loneliness, vulnerability, despair, spite, and fear. She often wrote about unhappy, loveless marriages and people with claustrophobic, sad and disappointed lives. Her studies of these relationships sometimes have a cruel tone. Another theme is about how the individual's need for expression is countered and restricted by the need for societal acceptance in a country that clung to traditions steeped in the church and strict convention. For example, in \"The Devil In Us\" she describes a convent school that uses morals to cruelly stop any type of nonconformity.\n\nBrennan also wrote stories set in or around Manhattan, which she described as \"the capsized city\u2014half-capsized, anyway, with the inhabitants hanging on, most of them still able to laugh as they cling to the island that is their life's predicament.\" These stories tend to be more satiric in tone, and she often parodies middle-class pretensions.\n\nBrennan's stories about her cats, dog and Long Island beach cottage show her mistrust of human nature and love of solitude and innocence.\n\nTwo collections of Brennan's short stories were published in her lifetime: ''In and Out of Never-Never Land'' was published in 1969, and ''Christmas Eve'' was published in 1974. These collections were well received in the United States, but there were no paperback editions. None of her books was published in Ireland or the UK.\n\n===Novella===\nBrennan wrote a novella, ''The Visitor'', in the 1940s, but it was not published until 2000, after the only known copy of the manuscript was discovered in the archives of the [[University of Notre Dame]].\n\n''The Visitor'' is about the destructive power of family pride and anger. In it, a 22-year-old woman called Anastasia King returns to Dublin to live with her grandmother after her parents die.  Anastasia's mother had left her husband and his judgemental, domineering mother and had moved to [[Paris]].

They participated in the [[1916 Easter Rising]] but while \u00dana was imprisoned for a few days, Robert was sentenced to death. The sentence was commuted to penal servitude.<ref name=\"mc\"/> His continuing political activity resulted in further imprisonments in 1917 and 1920. Maeve was born while he was in prison. He was director of publicity for the [[Anti-Treaty IRA|anti-Treaty Irish Republican Army]] during the [[Irish Civil War]]. He also founded and was the director of ''[[The Irish Press]]'' newspaper.<ref name=\"mc\"/> His imprisonments and activities greatly fragmented Maeve Brennan's childhood. In her story ''The Day We Got Our Own Back'' she recounts her memory of how, when she was five, her home was raided by [[Irish Free State|Free State]] forces looking for her father, who was on the run.\n\nRobert Brennan was appointed the Irish Free State's first minister to the United States, and the family moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1934, when Maeve was seventeen. She attended the [[Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods|Sisters of Providence]] Catholic school in Washington, [[Immaculata Seminary]], graduating in 1936. She then graduated with a degree in English from [[American University]] in 1938.<ref name=\"homesick\">{{cite book | title=Maeve Brennan: Homesick at The New Yorker | publisher=Counterpoint Press | author=Bourke, Angela | year=2004 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/maevebrennanhome00bour/page/127 127\u2013128] | isbn=1582432295 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/maevebrennanhome00bour/page/127 }}</ref> Maeve and two of her sisters remained in the United States when her parents and brother returned to Ireland in 1944.<ref name=\"mc\"/>\n\n===Career===\nBrennan moved to New York and found work as a fashion copywriter at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' in the 1940s. She also wrote a Manhattan column for the Dublin society magazine ''Social and Personal'', and wrote several short pieces for ''The New Yorker'' magazine. In 1949, she was offered a staff job by [[William Shawn]], ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s managing editor.\n\nBrennan first wrote for ''The New Yorker'' as a social diarist. She wrote sketches about New York life in ''The Talk of the Town'' section under the pseudonym \"The Long-Winded Lady\". She also contributed fiction criticism, fashion notes, and essays. She wrote about both Ireland and the United States.<ref name=\"mc\"/>\n\n''The New Yorker'' began publishing Brennan's short stories in 1950. The first of these stories was called \"The Holy Terror\". In it, Mary Ramsay, a \"garrulous, greedy heap of a woman\" tries to keep her job as a ladies' room attendant in a Dublin hotel.\n\nBrennan's work was fostered by [[William Keepers Maxwell Jr.|William Maxwell]], and she wrote under ''The New Yorker'' managing editors [[Harold Ross]] and William Shawn. Although she was widely read in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, she was almost unknown in Ireland, even though Dublin was the setting of many of her short stories.\n\nA compendium of her ''New Yorker'' articles called ''The Long-Winded Lady: Notes from the New Yorker'' was published in 1969. Two collections of short stories, ''In and Out of Never-Never Land'' (1969) and ''Christmas Eve'' (1974) were also published.\n\n===Personal life===\nBrennan was admired in New York society for her intelligence, wit, beauty, and style. She was a petite woman who frequently dressed in black and liked wearing large, dark glasses. She was eccentric, and never lived in any place for a long period of time. She was generous with her money, but she also liked to buy extravagant things and tended to live beyond her means. She occasionally visited [[Ireland]], but was wary of Ireland's religious and conservative society.\n\nWhile the love of her life was reportedly the writer and theatre critic/director [[Walter Kerr]], he broke off their engagement and married writer [[Jean Kerr|Bridget Jean Collins]]<ref name=\"bio_karl\">{{cite book |last1=Karl |first1=Michaela |title=\"Ich w\u00fcrde so etwas nie ohne Lippenstift lesen.\": Maeve Brennan. Eine Biographie |date=2019 |publisher=Hoffmann und Campe |isbn=3455504140}}</ref>. In 1954, Brennan married [[St. Clair McKelway]], ''The New Yorker''{{'}}s managing editor. McKelway had a history of alcoholism, womanizing and manic depression and had already been divorced four times<ref name=\"bio_karl\"/>. Brennan and McKelway divorced after five years.\n\n[[Edward Albee]] greatly admired Brennan and compared her to Chekhov and Flaubert. One of the characters in his play ''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung'' is called \"Long-Winded Lady\". He dedicated the published editions of ''Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-Tung'' (1968) and ''Box'' (1968) to her.\n\nBrennan was writing consistently and productively in the late 1960s. By the time her first books were published, however, she was showing signs of mental illness. Her previously immaculate appearance became unkempt. Her friends began to find her eccentricities disturbing rather than entertaining. She became obsessive.\n\nIn the 1970s Brennan became paranoid and alcoholic. Hospitalized on numerous occasions, she became destitute and homeless, frequently sleeping in the women's lavatory at ''The New Yorker''. She was last seen at the magazine's offices in 1981.\n\nIn the 1980s, Brennan vanished from view and her work was forgotten. After wandering from one transient hotel to another along [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]], she was admitted to Lawrence Nursing Home in Arverne. She died of a heart attack on November 1, 1993, at the age of seventy-six and is buried in [[Queens, New York City]].\n\n==Works==\nBrennan's writing style in her \"Long-Winded Lady\" pieces and in her short stories are quite different both in style and content.\n\n===''The New Yorker'' articles===\nBrennan's contributions as \"The Long-Winded Lady\" in ''The New Yorker'' are sardonic observations of New York life. In them, Brennan mocks [[Manhattan]] society and social tradition, but in a humorous, wistful, and often melancholy manner. In these stories she is an observer eavesdropping on strangers' conversations in bars, diners, hotel lobbies, and streets in places like [[Times Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]].  She then embellishes her observations with speculations and autobiographical details. Brennan is always an onlooker in these sketches, never a participant. For example, she watches a street protest against the [[Vietnam War]] from a window, but does not venture out onto the street. A compendium of her articles was published in 1969.\n\n===Short stories===\nBrennan's short stories are written in a simple, direct, and elegant style. She writes with a minimum of characters and plot. Some of her stories are quietly tender and poignant while others are satirical. The characters are emotionally unreachable and often lead stagnant lives where everything remains much the same. She often repeats characters from story to story, for example, Hubert and Rose Derdon, whose marriage is examined over stories set years apart. In the final Derdon story, \"The Drowned Man\", Rose has died and Hubert has to pretend that he is overwhelmed with grief for his dead wife, \"... she was gone, she had been good, and he wished he could miss her.\"\n\nThe main themes in Brennan's short stories are feelings of loneliness, vulnerability, despair, spite, and fear. She often wrote about unhappy, loveless marriages and people with claustrophobic, sad and disappointed lives. Her studies of these relationships sometimes have a cruel tone. Another theme is about how the individual's need for expression is countered and restricted by the need for societal acceptance in a country that clung to traditions steeped in the church and strict convention. For example, in \"The Devil In Us\" she describes a convent school that uses morals to cruelly stop any type of nonconformity.\n\nBrennan also wrote stories set in or around Manhattan, which she described as \"the capsized city\u2014half-capsized, anyway, with the inhabitants hanging on, most of them still able to laugh as they cling to the island that is their life's predicament.\" These stories tend to be more satiric in tone, and she often parodies middle-class pretensions.\n\nBrennan's stories about her cats, dog and Long Island beach cottage show her mistrust of human nature and love of solitude and innocence.\n\nTwo collections of Brennan's short stories were published in her lifetime: ''In and Out of Never-Never Land'' was published in 1969, and ''Christmas Eve'' was published in 1974. These collections were well received in the United States, but there were no paperback editions. None of her books was published in Ireland or the UK.\n\n===Novella===\nBrennan wrote a novella, ''The Visitor'', in the 1940s, but it was not published until 2000, after the only known copy of the manuscript was discovered in the archives of the [[University of Notre Dame]].\n\n''The Visitor'' is about the destructive power of family pride and anger. In it, a 22-year-old woman called Anastasia King returns to Dublin to live with her grandmother after her parents die.  Anastasia's mother had left her husband and his judgemental, domineering mother and had moved to [[Paris]]. Her grandmother is angry with Anastasia for choosing to live with her mother rather than her father. Desperate to stay in her childhood home, Anastasia tries to break through the wall of loneliness and isolation that surrounds her grandmother, but, as her efforts fail, loneliness threatens to envelop her in a detachment as cruel as that of her grandmother.\n\n==Posthumous publications==\n<!-- FAIR USE of Maeve_Brennan_biography.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Maeve_Brennan_biography.jpg for fair-use rationale -->\n[[Image:Maeve Brennan biography.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The front cover of Maeve Brennan's biography]]\nBrennan's writing was largely forgotten in the 1980s.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Brauner  | first1 = Fran\u00e7oise Erna  | authorlink = | title = L'an\u00e9antissement de deux r\u00e9seaux de la r\u00e9sistance | doi = 10.3917/sn.018.0034\n | journal = Sud/Nord | volume = 18  | issue = 1  | pages = 34-48 | year = 2003  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (O.S.E.) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Christophe Boltanski | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

These were, in addition to Catalan schoolchildren who were fortunate enough to stay in their school, refugees from Madrid who had witnessed tragic events. The Brauners made a pedo-psychiatric analysis of the child's drawing, a privileged mode of graphic expression of the young child, highlighting what seems to them characteristic of the child's drawing in the war, taking notes, creating medical records and questionnaires. Drawings and writings of children of the Spanish War were the result of a contest organized by Alfred Brauner among the children of Barcelona in 1938 on three themes: \"My life Before the War\", \"What I Saw from the War\" and \"How I See My Life after the War\".<ref name=thesis/> It was then the beginning of their work on \"children who have lived through the war.\" 4000 drawings of refugee children and numerous essays were collected in Spain, which later, along with other drawings of children in war, offered a unique testimony of the conflicts of the 20th century through the eyes of children.<ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 =Ibarz Serrat  | first1 = Virgilio  | authorlink = | title = Los dibujos infantiles de la guerra 1937-1938: el caso de la ni\u00f1a de Ballobar | doi = | journal = Diario del AltoArag\u00f3n | volume =  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2009  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Their project to publish drawings and testimonies of children in war received the support of [[Ilya Ehrenburg]] and [[Romain Rolland]] who \"regarded this collection as of considerable educational, historical and human interest.\"<ref name=\"Yannick Ripa\"/>\n \nIn 1939, Alfred Brauner welcomed 130 Jewish children from the Palatinate, Berlin and Austria,<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> survivors of the [[Kristallnacht]] at La Guette, a French castle owned by the Rothschild family and made available by [[Baroness Germaine de Rothschild]].<ref name=\"La Guette\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.ajpn.org/sauvetage-Chateau-de-la-Guette-245.html |title= Ch\u00e2teau de la Guette durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale (WWII) |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= www.ajpn.org/index.php | publisher= }}</ref><ref name=\"\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lochy  | first1 = Emilie | authorlink = | title = Extrait de l'ouvrage : Enfances en guerre - T\u00e9moignages d'enfants sur la guerre | doi = | journal = Le Cercle Psy | volume = 12  | issue =  | pages = | year = 2014 | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref> Alfred\u2019s  intention was to analyze the problems posed in working with children traumatized by their experiences and by separation from their families, with the aim of adapting them to a new life and preparing them for integration into France.<ref name=\"L'accueil\"/> He then described this educational experience in his state thesis, defended in 1946, entitled \"The Psychic Repercussions of Modern War on Childhood.\"<ref name=thesis/>\n \nFrom January 1941, Alfred Brauner entered the [[French Resistance]] and welcomed the [[Austrian resistance]]\u2019s leadership in his [[Rue Bonaparte]] apartment in [[Paris]].<ref name=\"Resistance\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Brauner  | first1 = Fran\u00e7oise Erna  | authorlink = | title = L'an\u00e9antissement de deux r\u00e9seaux de la r\u00e9sistance | doi = 10.3917/sn.018.0034\n | journal = Sud/Nord | volume = 18  | issue = 1  | pages = 34-48 | year = 2003  | jstor =| pmid = | pmc = }}</ref><ref name=\"Bio\"/> With members of the [[\u00d6sterreichische Freiheitsfront]] arriving every morning at a specific time, Alfred Brauner decided to open a German Language course as a cover from [[Gestapo]].<ref name=\"Resistance\"/> In 1945, he helped welcoming and educating 444 surviving boys from the [[Auschwitz]] and [[Buchenwald]] [[concentration camps]], in the scope of the [[Oeuvre de Secours aux Enfants]] (O.S.E.) in [[Ecouis]], [[France]].<ref name=\"Boltanski\">{{cite book | author = Christophe Boltanski | title = La Cache | page= | publisher = Stock | year = 2015  | isbn = 978-2-234-07637-2}}</ref><ref name=\"L'accueil\"/><ref name=\"Bio\"/> This welcoming of Buchenwald's child survivors in children's homes inspired the script of the film [[Nina's House]],<ref name=\" \">{{Cite web|url= https://jeudisducinema.be/La-maison-de-Nina |title= La maison de Nina |accessdate=21 April 2020 |website= jeudisducinema.be/ | publisher=Les jeudis du cinema }}</ref> as well as the documentary [[The Boys of Buchenwald]].\n \nIn 1950, Alfred Brauner created the \"Practical Research for Children,\" which brings together professionals of childhood in order to develop medico-pedagogical methods intended for the education of children with mental disabilities.<ref name=\"Mintec\"/> In 1955, he founded a day hospital for mentally and physically handicapped children located in the center of Paris, then transferred to Saint-Mand\u00e9, and worked on the rehabilitation of these children, giving priority to their education.<ref name=\"Bio\"/> Alfred Brauner was the ambassador of the association \"''Children Refugees of the World,''\" as well as the only non-physician president of the ''Society of Expression Psychopathology and Art Therapy''.<ref name=\"SFPE\">{{Cite web|url= https://www.sfpe-art-therapie.fr/Quelques-dates-qui-marquent-les-avancees-sur-trois-voies-paralleles_a34.html |title= Quelques dates qui marquent les avanc\u00e9es sur trois voies parall\u00e8les.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. While they have received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, the show's costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. Extensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe show is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

Intrigued, Plestis began to research the series and secured the rights to produce an American adaptation within one week in a deal brokered by his agent, Steve Wohl of [[Paradigm Talent Agency]]. He then called Fox executive Rob Wade on a Friday night to schedule a meeting with him the following Monday and worked to create a showcase during the weekend.<ref name=\"TVF Apr 2019\"/> According to Plestis, Wade was \"scared\" by the show but envisioned its potential.

Rather than follow the South Korean version in which two singers perform in three rounds, with the winner of the final round facing the winner of the previous episode in an attempt to become the new \"Mask King\", Ibarra opted to air one elimination per night, emphasize the clue packages and guessing component, and have the celebrities wear more extravagant costumes.<ref name=\"GH Feb 6\"/> Plestis agreed, wanting to create a [[story arc]] throughout the episodes and\u2014unlike the South Korean series\u2014be able to reuse the costumes.<ref name=\"TVF Apr 2019\"/> The series was officially ordered by Fox in August 2018.<ref name=\"VAR Aug 2\"/>\n\n[[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], the rightsholder of the ''Masked Singer'' format, lacked the ability to produce the show.

After they perform a cover of a famous song, the panelists and audience vote for their favorite performance and the celebrity with the fewest votes is eliminated from the competition, taking off their mask and revealing their identity. The [[Nick Cannon]]-hosted show was the first in the ''[[Masked Singer]]'' franchise to air outside of Asia, premiering on January 2, 2019, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. \n\nThe show employs four permanent panelists\u2014[[Ken Jeong]], [[Jenny McCarthy|Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg]], [[Nicole Scherzinger]], and [[Robin Thicke]]\u2014to make guesses as to who the celebrities could be after each performance, with a guest panelist often appearing alongside them. While they have received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, the show's costumes have attracted praise. They are designed by Marina Toybina and built by a team who incorporate both [[Haute couture|traditional fashion]] elements and innovative solutions that help the performer sing clearly and move freely on stage. In recognition of the show's costume design, it has won a [[Costume Designers Guild#Costume Designers Guild Awards|Costume Designers Guild Award]] and received a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] nomination.\n\nThe winners of the first and second seasons were [[T-Pain]] and [[Wayne Brady]], respectively. Extensive measures are taken by the show's production crew to prevent the identities of the contestants from leaking before an episode airs. The episodes themselves have received high television ratings; during the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]], the show was the highest rated new series among adults 18\u201349, leading some commentators to consider the show at the forefront of a new reality television era in the United States. It has spawned numerous spin-offs, including an upcoming dance version and a national tour. Subsequent adaptations of the ''Masked Singer'' franchise worldwide have been credited to the show's success, as has an interest in developing other television series centered on costumes. \n\nThe show is currently in its [[The Masked Singer (American season 3)|third season]] which premiered as the [[Super Bowl LIV]] [[List of Super Bowl lead-out programs|lead-out program]] on February 2, 2020. During an interview prior to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Rob Wade, President of Alternative Entertainment and Specials at Fox, confirmed that future seasons are planned.<ref name=\"TBI Apr 6\">{{cite web|last=Daswani|first=Mansha|title=Fox Entertainment's Rob Wade|url=https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|website=TV Formats|date=April 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200416012653/https://worldscreen.com/tvformats/fox-entertainments-rob-wade/|archive-date=April 15, 2020|url-status=live|quote=And then ''The Masked Dancer'' is coming up soon.

Standard anaesthesia machines typically contain up to 2&nbsp;kg of soda lime granules.\n\n[[Lithium hydroxide]] (LiOH) is the alkali hydroxide with the lowest molecular weight (Na: 23 g/mol; Li: 7 g/mol) and is therefore used as CO<sub>2</sub> absorbent in [[space flight]]s since the [[Apollo program]] to spare weight at launch.

The Kabetogama Peninsula, which lies entirely within the park and makes up most of its land area, is accessible only by boat. To the east of the park lies the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]].\n\nThe park has several boat ramps and visitor centers on its periphery, though the main body of the park is only accessible by boat or, in the winter, by [[snowmobile]], [[cross-country skiing|ski]], or [[snowshoe]]. In 2018, the park hosted 239,656 visitors.<ref name=\"visits\"/>\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:NPS Voyageurs National Park schematic geologic map.png|thumb|left|Voyageurs National Park schematic [[geologic map]]]]\nVoyageurs National Park is located on the [[Canadian Shield]], with the rocks averaging between 1 and 3 billion years old. Formed during the early ages of the earth formation, the rocks of the park were compressed, and folded under tremendous pressure. Then molten flows of lava intruded through the layers creating a mosaic of various gneiss and granites. Over time, additional layers of sedimentary rocks developed on top, to be stripped away by the continental glaciers of the Wisconsin Glacial epoch and earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/naturescience/naturalfeaturesandecosystems.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - Natural Features & Ecosystems |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the park belong to the [[Archeon eon|Archeon]] Quetico [[geologic province|Subprovince]], of the Superior [[Physiographic province]], associated with the [[Kenoran Orogeny]]. These consist of [[schist]]s and [[gneiss]]es in the west and central portion of the park, and [[granitic]] rocks of the Vermillion Granitic Complex (2.69 to 2.64 [[Byr|Ga]]) in the east and southeast.  The Kabetogama-Kenora [[dike swarm]] (2.2. to 2.1 Ga) follows a northwesterly trending [[Precambrian]] fault system.  The northwest corner of the park contains [[metamorphosed rock]]s of the Wabigoon subprovince, which form a northeast trending [[greenstone belt]].  A lateral [[strike-slip fault]] separates the two subprovinces, referred to as the Rainy Lake-Seine River fault zone.  It is this northwest area of the park, on the Kabetogama peninsula, which saw a [[gold rush]] from 1893 to 1898.  The Little American Mine, on Little American Island, is one of 13 abandoned mines within park boundaries.  [[Terminal moraine]]s are found in the southern portion of the park, while the northern portion contains glacially scoured lake basins, but accumulations of [[glacial outwash]] and [[glacial till]] less than 100 feet is the norm.  [[Lake Agassiz]] deposits are evident within the park, while [[glacial striation]]s and [[glacial erratic]]s are common.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=J.|title=Voyageurs National Park Geologic Resource Evaluation Report, Natural Resource Report NPS/NRPC/GRD/NRR 2007/007|date=2007|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|location=Denver|page=3,8,11\u201313}}</ref><ref>http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NPS_Voyageurs_National_Park_geologic_map.pdf</ref><ref>https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NPS_Voyageurs_National_Park_geologic_map_legend.pdf</ref>\n\n==Access==\n[[File:NPS Voyageurs National Park map.png|thumb|Park map (click on map to enlarge)]]\nThe largest city near Voyageurs National Park is [[International Falls, Minnesota]].

Lake Namakan and Sand Point Lake are accessible only by boat except in the winter. The southern boundary of the park is the northern shore of [[Crane Lake, Minnesota|Crane Lake]]. The park has many smaller lakes, especially on the Kabetogama peninsula. The most popular of these are on the Locator Lakes trail.\n\n==Activities==\n\n=== Camping===\n[[File:Voya-ImageF 00017 (camping).jpg|thumb|Campsite on a park shoreline]]\nCampsites are maintained by the [[National Park Service]] and are accessible only by water. The 282 sites are classified as frontcountry or backcountry tent, houseboat, or day-use sites; all are designated by signs. Tenters may not camp in houseboat sites or day-use sites. Maps showing the location of these sites are available at the visitor centers. Permits are required for overnight stays. Permits can be obtained at recreation.gov and any park visitor center or boat ramp. Public and private campgrounds, accessible by car, are located near the perimeter of the park.<ref name=brochure/>\n\n===Fishing===\nThe major lakes in the park are home to [[Walleye]], [[Northern pike]], [[Muskellunge]], [[Smallmouth bass]], and [[Crappie]]. In the minor lakes that dot the park, [[Largemouth bass]], [[Lake trout]], [[Bluegill]] and other small sunfish and [[Yellow Perch]] are also found, although not every lake has every species. For example, Lake Trout are found primarily in Cruiser Lake north of Kettle Falls. Shoepack and Root (Little Shoepack) lakes in the center of the park's peninsula are home to the Shoepack strain of [[Muskellunge]], distinctly different from the Mississippi strain (or Leech Lake strain) found throughout southern Minnesota and Wisconsin. [[Lake Whitefish]] are also a popular quarry via sport netting in the fall when they move into shallow water to spawn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakefind/index.html |title=LakeFinder |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===Boating===\nVisitors travel and explore the park's lakes and islands with canoes, kayaks and motorboats. The park's interior peninsula is only accessible by boat except when frozen lakes provide outer routes. The park has a system of canoes and boats available for rental at interior lakes. During summer months, the park also offers shuttle service to an interior lake, as well as ranger-led boat tours that explore the park's natural features and history.\n\n===Hiking===\nThe park has over {{convert|50|mi|km|sigfig=1}} of hiking trails. While some trails are located on the mainland, the majority traverse the park's interior peninsula, including long-distance backcountry trails.\n\n===In winter===\n[[File:A555, Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA, 2013.jpg|thumb|Rainy Lake ice road in early April 2013]]\nThe park is snow-covered from late November until early April. An ice road on Rainy Lake is plowed and marked from the visitor center's boat ramp, heading toward Cranberry Bay or around Dryweed Island, depending on ice conditions. Available activities include lake driving, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, winter camping, ice fishing and snowshoe hiking. Snowmobiling is limited to the frozen lake surfaces and the Chain of Lakes Scenic Trail through the center of the Kabetogama Peninsula. Trail maps can be obtained from the visitor centers.<ref name=brochure/>\n\nThe use of snowmobiles in Voyageurs National Park, like in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], is controversial, with opponents claiming they damage the natural beauty of the park and adversely affect wildlife.\n\n'''Designated Snowmobile Trails'''<br />\n''Rainy Lake Trail'' is {{convert|28|mi|km|0}} long running from Black Bay (the Rainy Lake Visitor Center) to Kettle Falls. It runs along the northern shore of the Kabetogama Peninsula, running inside the off shore islands.

Here, it joins into the Voyageur Trail.<ref name=snowmap/>\n\n[[File:Voya-ImageF 00008 (winter snowmobile).jpg|thumb|Snowmobiling in the park]]\nThe ''Voyageur Trail'' is a multiple segmented trail, beginning near the Thunderbird Lodge. From Black Bay (Rainy Lake Visitor Center), it is nearly {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} long to the junction with the ''Chain of Lakes Trail'' on the Kabetogama Peninsula. An additional {{convert|3.5|mi|km|0}} crossing the west end of Kabetogama Lake brings you into the Kabetogama community with a short {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} or so drop around the point to the Kabetogama Visitor Center. In the Kabetogama community, there are linkes to the ''Arrowhead Trail'', ''Woody's Trail'', ''Peterson Bay Trail'', ''Tone Dawg Trail'', and the ''Ray Access Spur''.<ref name=snowmap/>\n\nAfter leaving the Kabetogama Visitor Center, the ''Voyageur Trail'' crosses the south side of Kabetogama Lake for {{convert|7|mi|km|0}}, to the Kabetogama Narrows (Ash River Visitor Center) and the '' Rudder Bay Trail''. Another {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} brings it to Ash River. In Ash River, there are links to other trails, including ''Bill Morgan Trail'' and the  'Ash River Links\" to both the Arrowhead Trail and Crane Lake. By staying on the ''Voyageur Trail'', you'll cross the southern shore of Namakan Lake and then turn south through Nakd Point Lake, Mukoda Lake and Crane Lake to Crane. This last link is {{convert|28|mi|km|0}} long. The entire length of the ''Voyageur Trail'' is about {{convert|37|mi|km|0}}.<ref name=snowmap/>\n\n==Climate==\n\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Voyageurs National Park has a [[Humid continental climate]] with mild summers and dry winters (''Dwb''). ''Dwb'' climates have their coldest month averaging below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), all months with average temperatures below 22 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F), at least four months averaging above 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F), and at least 70% of the average annual precipitation received in the warmest six months. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the Plant [[Hardiness zone]] at the Ash River Visitor Center (1129 ft / 344 m) is 3a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of -36.3&nbsp;\u00b0F (-37.9&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite web|url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=2019-07-19|title=USDA Interactive Plant Hardiness Map}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box\t\n| width = auto\t\n| single line = Y\t\n| location = Ash River Visitor Center, Voyageurs National Park.

[[Bald eagle]], [[loon]], [[double-crested cormorant]], [[owl]], and [[warbler]]s are common birds found.\n\n==History==\nThe park was first proposed in April 1891 by the [[Minnesota Legislature]] in a resolution requesting that the president create a national park in the state. It wasn't until nearly eighty years later that federal legislation authorizing the creation of the park was signed into law by President [[Richard Nixon]] on January 8, 1971.\n\n===First inhabitants===\nVoyageurs National Park has been occupied by humans for nearly 10,000 years. During the [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian Period]], people entered this area as the waters from [[glacial Lake Agassiz]] receded. Then during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic Period]] (8,000 B.C. - 100 B.C.) nomadic people moved with the animals they hunted and with the ripening grains. Fishing grew into a major source of food during this time. The Woodland Period (100 A.D.- 900 A.D.) saw an increase in the use of the wild rice. Beginning around this time, they used ceramics to create small, side-notched triangular projectile points.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/historyculture/people.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - The First People |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===The Fur Trade===\nEuropean exploration began about 1688. French explorer [[Jacques de Noyon]] wintered along the [[Rainy River (Minnesota\u2013Ontario)|Rainy River]]. But it was the demand for beaver pelts that brought the fur traders. As competition in the east depleted the beaver, the [[voyageurs]] expanded their range into the northwest territories of North America. Here along the modern border of the United States and Canada, the [[Cree]], Monsoni, and [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]] tribes were first Native American contacts. By the mid-18th century these people had abandoned the Rainy Lake area, to the [[Ojibwe]]. By 1780 the Ojibwe were the primary residents on the border. They filled key roles as suppliers of food, furs, and canoes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/historyculture/the-fur-trade.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - The Fur Trade |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===Logging===\nLogging came to the northwoods as the stands of [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]] in [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]] and central [[Minnesota]] were harvested. Beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, logging grew until there were two major logging companies. The International Logging Company in [[Koochiching County, Minnesota|Koochiching County]] used sawmills at International Falls and Fort Frances until 1937. It was the constant need for water that caused the dams to be constructed at International Falls, Kettle Falls, and Squirrel Falls in the early 1900s. The Virginia and Rainy Lake Lumber Company harvested trees to the east in [[St. Louis County, Minnesota|Saint Louis County]]. They rafted logs down river to Hoist Bay until 1929. Hoist Bay is named for the machinery used to hoist floating logs out of the lake. Trains then took them to sawmills in [[Virginia, Minnesota]]. The logging has altered the composition of the forest. Where white and red pine once dominated the forest, they are a minor part. Few stands of large, mature trees exist in the park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/historyculture/logging.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - Logging |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===The Rainy Lake gold rush===\nIn the summer of 1893 George Davis, funded by Charles Moore, discovered gold on Rainy Lake. Davis was on a small island near Black Bay Narrows. Here, he found a gold-bearing quartz vein. The \"Little American\" discovery gave rise to the island's modern name, Little American Island. With confirmation of the discovery, Charles Moore hired Jeff Hildreth, a miner from the [[Black Hills]] to obtain title to the island. In the spring of 1894, development of the mine and of the nearby Rainy Lake City began. Rainy Lake City was incorporated on March 17, 1894.<ref name=\"kc-hgs83\">{{cite web |last=Schwankl |first=Hermoine Gordon |title=The History Of Koochiching County |url=http://www.co.koochiching.mn.us/history/histmain.htm |publisher=Koochiching County |accessdate=2012-03-08 |year=1983 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405114001/http://www.co.koochiching.mn.us/history/histmain.htm |archivedate=2010-04-05 }}</ref>  By summer the city was a community of several hundred people. It had a school house, bank, general store, hotels, restaurants, a newspaper, hardware store, butcher shop, and several saloons. With the development of the Little American Mine, other prospectors entered into the search. Mining remains which can still be seen include those of the Lyle Mine north of Dryweed Island, the Big American Mine on Big American Island, the Bushyhead Mine on Bushyhead Island, and the Soldier Mine on Dryweed Island. The low production from the mines ended the rush with a bust by 1898. The town of Rainy Lake City was gone by 1901.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/historyculture/mining.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - Mining |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===Settlement and recreation===\nWhen the park was established in 1975, there were over 60 resorts around the park. Within the park, there were 12 resorts, 97 leased cabin sites, and over 120 privately owned recreational homes. Many sold their land and buildings to the park. Some people chose to sell their property and leave immediately, while others chose to sell their property, but maintain use for either a lifetime tenancy or a 25-year use and occupancy reservation. As these properties are vacated, the park will remove many structures to restore natural conditions. Twenty properties, containing over 50 structures, will be retained and managed by the National Park Service because of their historic significance.\n\n===Commercial Fishing===\nLarge fishing operations began on the Rainy River in 1892. By the 1890s and early 1900s, seven or eight fishing companies operated in the area. Most were on Crane Lake. The main production was caviar, taken from the eggs of [[lake sturgeon]]. Most fell by the wayside as long distances and a lack of refrigeration affected the industry. By the 1930s all the large operations were gone.\n\nFamily fishing replaced the large operations. By 1910 there were around 48 family business'. The catch was sold at local auctions held at Kettle Falls. By 1923, commercial fishing was banned on Kabetogama Lake. By 1942 only 10 licensed family operations were active. Old fishing camps and net-tarring sites still exist in the park. The best preserved is the Oveson Fish Camp (c. 1950s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/historyculture/commercial-fishing.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - Commercial Fishing |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:A554, Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA, 2013.jpg|thumb|Frozen Rainy Lake covered by snow in early spring]]\n\n===Rainy Lake sites===\n'''[[Kettle Falls Hotel]]'''<br />Kettle Falls is located between Lake Namakan and Rainy Lake, and is the location of the Kettle Falls Hotel.

If you're on ''Sand Point Lake'' or ''Crane Lake'', upbound is going south.<ref name=brochure/>\n\nHazardous rocks are common throughout the park and can lie just beneath the surface. Less than ten percent of these hazards are marked.  The park consists of parallel ridges of rock, which form the islands and the peninsula.<ref name=brochure/>\n\n===Winter===\n'''Snowmobiling''' is a major recreational activity during the winter months. In the heart of the season, the most hazardous areas regarding thin ice or open water are along the river channels including places like Rainy River or any of the narrows. The current under the ice causes pressure ridges and soft spots. Snowmobiles generally avoid these areas.<ref name=brochure/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Grand Portage National Monument]], historic Voyageur site\n* [[Fur trade]]\n* [[Fort Beauharnois]], French trading post\n* [[Fort St. Charles]], French trading fort on the [[Manitoba]] and [[Minnesota]] border\n* [[Fort St. Pierre]], trading post built by [[Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de La V\u00e9rendrye|La V\u00e9rendrye]] on Rainy Lake\n* [[Fort Kaministiquia]], French and English post on Lake Superior\n* [[Lake of the Woods]]\n* [[North American fur trade]]\n* [[Voyageurs National Park Association]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Sister project links|wikt=no|commons=Category:Voyageurs National Park|b=no|n=no|q=no|s=no|v=no|voy=Voyageurs National Park|species=no|d=no}}\n* {{Official website}} of the [https://www.nps.gov/index.htm National Park Service]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080923024019/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=17415 Voyageurs National Park] at [[NASA Earth Observatory]]\n* [http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakefind/ Minnesota DNR Lakefinder]\n* [https://www.explore.voyage/urs/ Voyageurs National Park Digital Map & Campsite Directory]\n\n{{Protected Areas of Minnesota}}\n{{National parks of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:1975 establishments in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 1975]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of Koochiching County, Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Protected areas of St. Louis County, Minnesota]]\n[[Category:Voyageurs National Park| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox protected area\n| name = Voyageurs National Park\n| iucn_category = II\n| photo = Voyageurs National Park.jpg\n| photo_caption = Early autumn in Voyageurs National Park\n| map = USA#Minnesota\n| relief = 1\n| map_caption = Location in the United States##Location in Minnesota\n| location = [[St. Louis County, Minnesota|Saint Louis]] & [[Koochiching County, Minnesota|Koochiching]] counties, [[Minnesota]], United States\n| nearest_city = [[International Falls, Minnesota|International Falls]]\n| coordinates = {{coords|48|30|N|92|53|W|region:US|display=inline, title}}\n| established = April 8, 1975\n| area_acre = 218200\n| area_ref = <ref name=\"area\">{{NPS area|year=2011|accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n| visitation_num = 239,656\n| visitation_year = 2018\n| visitation_ref = <ref name=\"visits\">{{NPS Visitation|accessdate=2019-03-11}}</ref>\n| governing_body = [[National Park Service]]\n| website = {{Official website}}\n}}\n\n'''Voyageurs National Park''' is an American [[national park]] in northern [[Minnesota]] near the town of [[International Falls, Minnesota|International Falls]] established in 1975. The park's name commemorates the ''[[Coureur des bois|voyageurs]]''\u2014[[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] [[fur trade]]rs who were the first [[Europe]]an settlers to frequently travel through the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/historyculture/people.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - People |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref> The park is notable for its outstanding water resources and is popular with [[canoe]]ists, [[kayak]]ers, other boaters, and [[Fisherman|fishermen]]. The Kabetogama Peninsula, which lies entirely within the park and makes up most of its land area, is accessible only by boat. To the east of the park lies the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]].\n\nThe park has several boat ramps and visitor centers on its periphery, though the main body of the park is only accessible by boat or, in the winter, by [[snowmobile]], [[cross-country skiing|ski]], or [[snowshoe]]. In 2018, the park hosted 239,656 visitors.<ref name=\"visits\"/>\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:NPS Voyageurs National Park schematic geologic map.png|thumb|left|Voyageurs National Park schematic [[geologic map]]]]\nVoyageurs National Park is located on the [[Canadian Shield]], with the rocks averaging between 1 and 3 billion years old. Formed during the early ages of the earth formation, the rocks of the park were compressed, and folded under tremendous pressure. Then molten flows of lava intruded through the layers creating a mosaic of various gneiss and granites. Over time, additional layers of sedimentary rocks developed on top, to be stripped away by the continental glaciers of the Wisconsin Glacial epoch and earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/naturescience/naturalfeaturesandecosystems.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - Natural Features & Ecosystems |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-07}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the park belong to the [[Archeon eon|Archeon]] Quetico [[geologic province|Subprovince]], of the Superior [[Physiographic province]], associated with the [[Kenoran Orogeny]]. These consist of [[schist]]s and [[gneiss]]es in the west and central portion of the park, and [[granitic]] rocks of the Vermillion Granitic Complex (2.69 to 2.64 [[Byr|Ga]]) in the east and southeast.  The Kabetogama-Kenora [[dike swarm]] (2.2. to 2.1 Ga) follows a northwesterly trending [[Precambrian]] fault system.  The northwest corner of the park contains [[metamorphosed rock]]s of the Wabigoon subprovince, which form a northeast trending [[greenstone belt]].  A lateral [[strike-slip fault]] separates the two subprovinces, referred to as the Rainy Lake-Seine River fault zone.  It is this northwest area of the park, on the Kabetogama peninsula, which saw a [[gold rush]] from 1893 to 1898.  The Little American Mine, on Little American Island, is one of 13 abandoned mines within park boundaries.  [[Terminal moraine]]s are found in the southern portion of the park, while the northern portion contains glacially scoured lake basins, but accumulations of [[glacial outwash]] and [[glacial till]] less than 100 feet is the norm.  [[Lake Agassiz]] deposits are evident within the park, while [[glacial striation]]s and [[glacial erratic]]s are common.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=J.|title=Voyageurs National Park Geologic Resource Evaluation Report, Natural Resource Report NPS/NRPC/GRD/NRR 2007/007|date=2007|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|location=Denver|page=3,8,11\u201313}}</ref><ref>http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NPS_Voyageurs_National_Park_geologic_map.pdf</ref><ref>https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NPS_Voyageurs_National_Park_geologic_map_legend.pdf</ref>\n\n==Access==\n[[File:NPS Voyageurs National Park map.png|thumb|Park map (click on map to enlarge)]]\nThe largest city near Voyageurs National Park is [[International Falls, Minnesota]].

The park has many smaller lakes, especially on the Kabetogama peninsula. The most popular of these are on the Locator Lakes trail.\n\n==Activities==\n\n=== Camping===\n[[File:Voya-ImageF 00017 (camping).jpg|thumb|Campsite on a park shoreline]]\nCampsites are maintained by the [[National Park Service]] and are accessible only by water. The 282 sites are classified as frontcountry or backcountry tent, houseboat, or day-use sites; all are designated by signs. Tenters may not camp in houseboat sites or day-use sites. Maps showing the location of these sites are available at the visitor centers. Permits are required for overnight stays. Permits can be obtained at recreation.gov and any park visitor center or boat ramp. Public and private campgrounds, accessible by car, are located near the perimeter of the park.<ref name=brochure/>\n\n===Fishing===\nThe major lakes in the park are home to [[Walleye]], [[Northern pike]], [[Muskellunge]], [[Smallmouth bass]], and [[Crappie]]. In the minor lakes that dot the park, [[Largemouth bass]], [[Lake trout]], [[Bluegill]] and other small sunfish and [[Yellow Perch]] are also found, although not every lake has every species. For example, Lake Trout are found primarily in Cruiser Lake north of Kettle Falls. Shoepack and Root (Little Shoepack) lakes in the center of the park's peninsula are home to the Shoepack strain of [[Muskellunge]], distinctly different from the Mississippi strain (or Leech Lake strain) found throughout southern Minnesota and Wisconsin. [[Lake Whitefish]] are also a popular quarry via sport netting in the fall when they move into shallow water to spawn.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/lakefind/index.html |title=LakeFinder |publisher=Minnesota Department of Natural Resources |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===Boating===\nVisitors travel and explore the park's lakes and islands with canoes, kayaks and motorboats. The park's interior peninsula is only accessible by boat except when frozen lakes provide outer routes. The park has a system of canoes and boats available for rental at interior lakes. During summer months, the park also offers shuttle service to an interior lake, as well as ranger-led boat tours that explore the park's natural features and history.\n\n===Hiking===\nThe park has over {{convert|50|mi|km|sigfig=1}} of hiking trails. While some trails are located on the mainland, the majority traverse the park's interior peninsula, including long-distance backcountry trails.\n\n===In winter===\n[[File:A555, Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA, 2013.jpg|thumb|Rainy Lake ice road in early April 2013]]\nThe park is snow-covered from late November until early April. An ice road on Rainy Lake is plowed and marked from the visitor center's boat ramp, heading toward Cranberry Bay or around Dryweed Island, depending on ice conditions. Available activities include lake driving, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing, winter camping, ice fishing and snowshoe hiking. Snowmobiling is limited to the frozen lake surfaces and the Chain of Lakes Scenic Trail through the center of the Kabetogama Peninsula. Trail maps can be obtained from the visitor centers.<ref name=brochure/>\n\nThe use of snowmobiles in Voyageurs National Park, like in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], is controversial, with opponents claiming they damage the natural beauty of the park and adversely affect wildlife.\n\n'''Designated Snowmobile Trails'''<br />\n''Rainy Lake Trail'' is {{convert|28|mi|km|0}} long running from Black Bay (the Rainy Lake Visitor Center) to Kettle Falls.

Here, it joins into the Voyageur Trail.<ref name=snowmap/>\n\n[[File:Voya-ImageF 00008 (winter snowmobile).jpg|thumb|Snowmobiling in the park]]\nThe ''Voyageur Trail'' is a multiple segmented trail, beginning near the Thunderbird Lodge. From Black Bay (Rainy Lake Visitor Center), it is nearly {{convert|6|mi|km|0}} long to the junction with the ''Chain of Lakes Trail'' on the Kabetogama Peninsula. An additional {{convert|3.5|mi|km|0}} crossing the west end of Kabetogama Lake brings you into the Kabetogama community with a short {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} or so drop around the point to the Kabetogama Visitor Center. In the Kabetogama community, there are linkes to the ''Arrowhead Trail'', ''Woody's Trail'', ''Peterson Bay Trail'', ''Tone Dawg Trail'', and the ''Ray Access Spur''.<ref name=snowmap/>\n\nAfter leaving the Kabetogama Visitor Center, the ''Voyageur Trail'' crosses the south side of Kabetogama Lake for {{convert|7|mi|km|0}}, to the Kabetogama Narrows (Ash River Visitor Center) and the '' Rudder Bay Trail''. Another {{convert|3|mi|km|0}} brings it to Ash River. In Ash River, there are links to other trails, including ''Bill Morgan Trail'' and the  'Ash River Links\" to both the Arrowhead Trail and Crane Lake. By staying on the ''Voyageur Trail'', you'll cross the southern shore of Namakan Lake and then turn south through Nakd Point Lake, Mukoda Lake and Crane Lake to Crane. This last link is {{convert|28|mi|km|0}} long. The entire length of the ''Voyageur Trail'' is about {{convert|37|mi|km|0}}.<ref name=snowmap/>\n\n==Climate==\n\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Voyageurs National Park has a [[Humid continental climate]] with mild summers and dry winters (''Dwb''). ''Dwb'' climates have their coldest month averaging below 0 \u00b0C (32 \u00b0F), all months with average temperatures below 22 \u00b0C (71.6 \u00b0F), at least four months averaging above 10 \u00b0C (50 \u00b0F), and at least 70% of the average annual precipitation received in the warmest six months.

[[Bald eagle]], [[loon]], [[double-crested cormorant]], [[owl]], and [[warbler]]s are common birds found.\n\n==History==\nThe park was first proposed in April 1891 by the [[Minnesota Legislature]] in a resolution requesting that the president create a national park in the state. It wasn't until nearly eighty years later that federal legislation authorizing the creation of the park was signed into law by President [[Richard Nixon]] on January 8, 1971.\n\n===First inhabitants===\nVoyageurs National Park has been occupied by humans for nearly 10,000 years. During the [[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian Period]], people entered this area as the waters from [[glacial Lake Agassiz]] receded. Then during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic Period]] (8,000 B.C. - 100 B.C.) nomadic people moved with the animals they hunted and with the ripening grains. Fishing grew into a major source of food during this time. The Woodland Period (100 A.D.- 900 A.D.) saw an increase in the use of the wild rice. Beginning around this time, they used ceramics to create small, side-notched triangular projectile points.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/historyculture/people.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - The First People |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===The Fur Trade===\nEuropean exploration began about 1688. French explorer [[Jacques de Noyon]] wintered along the [[Rainy River (Minnesota\u2013Ontario)|Rainy River]]. But it was the demand for beaver pelts that brought the fur traders. As competition in the east depleted the beaver, the [[voyageurs]] expanded their range into the northwest territories of North America. Here along the modern border of the United States and Canada, the [[Cree]], Monsoni, and [[Assiniboine people|Assiniboine]] tribes were first Native American contacts. By the mid-18th century these people had abandoned the Rainy Lake area, to the [[Ojibwe]]. By 1780 the Ojibwe were the primary residents on the border. They filled key roles as suppliers of food, furs, and canoes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/historyculture/the-fur-trade.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - The Fur Trade |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===Logging===\nLogging came to the northwoods as the stands of [[Eastern White Pine|white pine]] in [[Michigan]], [[Wisconsin]] and central [[Minnesota]] were harvested. Beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, logging grew until there were two major logging companies. The International Logging Company in [[Koochiching County, Minnesota|Koochiching County]] used sawmills at International Falls and Fort Frances until 1937. It was the constant need for water that caused the dams to be constructed at International Falls, Kettle Falls, and Squirrel Falls in the early 1900s. The Virginia and Rainy Lake Lumber Company harvested trees to the east in [[St. Louis County, Minnesota|Saint Louis County]]. They rafted logs down river to Hoist Bay until 1929. Hoist Bay is named for the machinery used to hoist floating logs out of the lake. Trains then took them to sawmills in [[Virginia, Minnesota]]. The logging has altered the composition of the forest. Where white and red pine once dominated the forest, they are a minor part. Few stands of large, mature trees exist in the park.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/historyculture/logging.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - Logging |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n===The Rainy Lake gold rush===\nIn the summer of 1893 George Davis, funded by Charles Moore, discovered gold on Rainy Lake. Davis was on a small island near Black Bay Narrows. Here, he found a gold-bearing quartz vein. The \"Little American\" discovery gave rise to the island's modern name, Little American Island. With confirmation of the discovery, Charles Moore hired Jeff Hildreth, a miner from the [[Black Hills]] to obtain title to the island. In the spring of 1894, development of the mine and of the nearby Rainy Lake City began. Rainy Lake City was incorporated on March 17, 1894.<ref name=\"kc-hgs83\">{{cite web |last=Schwankl |first=Hermoine Gordon |title=The History Of Koochiching County |url=http://www.co.koochiching.mn.us/history/histmain.htm |publisher=Koochiching County |accessdate=2012-03-08 |year=1983 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405114001/http://www.co.koochiching.mn.us/history/histmain.htm |archivedate=2010-04-05 }}</ref>  By summer the city was a community of several hundred people. It had a school house, bank, general store, hotels, restaurants, a newspaper, hardware store, butcher shop, and several saloons. With the development of the Little American Mine, other prospectors entered into the search. Mining remains which can still be seen include those of the Lyle Mine north of Dryweed Island, the Big American Mine on Big American Island, the Bushyhead Mine on Bushyhead Island, and the Soldier Mine on Dryweed Island. The low production from the mines ended the rush with a bust by 1898.

Within the park, there were 12 resorts, 97 leased cabin sites, and over 120 privately owned recreational homes. Many sold their land and buildings to the park. Some people chose to sell their property and leave immediately, while others chose to sell their property, but maintain use for either a lifetime tenancy or a 25-year use and occupancy reservation. As these properties are vacated, the park will remove many structures to restore natural conditions. Twenty properties, containing over 50 structures, will be retained and managed by the National Park Service because of their historic significance.\n\n===Commercial Fishing===\nLarge fishing operations began on the Rainy River in 1892. By the 1890s and early 1900s, seven or eight fishing companies operated in the area. Most were on Crane Lake. The main production was caviar, taken from the eggs of [[lake sturgeon]]. Most fell by the wayside as long distances and a lack of refrigeration affected the industry. By the 1930s all the large operations were gone.\n\nFamily fishing replaced the large operations. By 1910 there were around 48 family business'. The catch was sold at local auctions held at Kettle Falls. By 1923, commercial fishing was banned on Kabetogama Lake. By 1942 only 10 licensed family operations were active. Old fishing camps and net-tarring sites still exist in the park. The best preserved is the Oveson Fish Camp (c. 1950s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/historyculture/commercial-fishing.htm |title=Voyageurs National Park - Commercial Fishing |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n==Points of interest==\n[[File:A554, Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA, 2013.jpg|thumb|Frozen Rainy Lake covered by snow in early spring]]\n\n===Rainy Lake sites===\n'''[[Kettle Falls Hotel]]'''<br />Kettle Falls is located between Lake Namakan and Rainy Lake, and is the location of the Kettle Falls Hotel. The hotel was constructed in 1910 by timber baron Ed Rose and operated as a hotel and resort to this day. It was placed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1976. Kettle Falls can only be reached by boat in the summer months and is one of the few places in the lower forty-eight states where one looks south into Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kettlefallshotel.com/ |title=Kettle Falls Hotel |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref><ref name=destinations>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/voya/planyourvisit/upload/Visitor-Destinations-brochure-web-quality.pdf |title=Visitor Destinations |publisher=Voyageur National Park |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>\n\n'''Anderson Bay'''<br />\nAnderson Bay is a fine example of why the park was established. The bluffs of the Bay rise {{convert|80|ft|m|sigfig=1}} above the water. From the top, there are views of the bay and Rainy Lake. '''Anderson Bay''' is the northern trailhead for the Cruiser Lake Trail system. From the landing, a loop trail goes to the top of the bluffs. Anderson Bay is two-thirds of the way from Rainy Lake Visitor Center to Kettle Point. It is on the north side of the Kabetogama Peninsula.<ref name=destinations/>\n\n'''Surveyor's Island'''<br />Surveyor's Island is on the east end of Rainy Lake marking the entry to the '''American Channel''' to Kettle Falls. Here the boundary surveyors had a campsite during the early 1900s. Voyageurs would use this island as a stop before they entered the open waters of Rainy Lake.<ref name=destinations/>\n\n'''Camp Marston'''<br />Camp Marston was Iowa State University operated a summer camp from 1922 until 1940. Civil engineering students would attend the camp. Today there is still a cabin known as \"Polaris,\" where the professors lived and foundations and chimneys from other structures.\n\n'''Rainy Lake City'''<br />Rainy Lake City was a boom town in the 1890s during a short gold rush period. The site has a longer history of use than just the gold rush. A saloon still stands and is proposed as a shelter for exhibits. Former streets and archeological remains of buildings can be seen. Rainy Lake City is the northwestern point of the Kabetogama Peninsula facing Little American Island and the mainland.<ref name=destinations/>\n\n'''Harry Oveson Fish Camp'''<br />\nOveson's fish camp is an intact commercial fishing camp. There are still several structures, including Oveson house, ice house, and fish processing building.<ref name=destinations/>\n\n'''Little American Island'''<br />Little American Island is on Rainy Lake just north of the mainland.

Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.\n\n=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===\nIn 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975\u20132001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors \u2013 rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850\u20131975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThese dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965\u20131975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name=\"kellogg.northwestern.edu\"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?)

Kellogg accepts the [[Graduate Record Examination]] in addition to the GMAT from applicants.<ref name=\"GRE\">{{cite news |last=Moules |first=Jonathan |date=14 May 2018 |title=The GMAT is no longer the only way into business school|work=Financial Times |location=United Kingdom }}</ref> Students may choose from seven majors including accounting, economics, finance, marketing, operations, strategy, and managing organizations. If a student does not elect a major \"General Management\" will appear on their transcript. In addition to majors, Kellogg offers \"pathways\" to students who want to build expertise in certain industries. These include data analytics, entrepreneurship, growth and scaling, healthcare, real estate, social impact, and venture capital & private equity.\n\n====One-year MBA====\nKellogg offers a one-year MBA program for students who have already completed a specified list of prerequisite courses, including undergraduate-level financial accounting, statistics, finance, economics, marketing, and operations. The one-year program began in 1965 and has more than 3,500 graduates around the world. Program graduates include [[Robert Eckert]] '77, former chairman and CEO, [[Mattel]]; Richard Lenny '77, former chairman and CEO, the [[The Hershey Company|Hershey Company]]; and [[Thomas J. Wilson]] '80, chairman and CEO, [[Allstate]].

Within the E&W MBA program, Kellogg offers both an evening program and a weekend program. The E&W MBA requires 20.5 credits to complete. Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.\n\n====Executive MBA====\nKellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives. Executives can choose between two campuses, Evanston and Miami, and also two schedules, one weekend a month or two weekends a month.\n\n====MMM====\nGraduates of the MMM program earn both an MBA from Kellogg and an MS in Design Innovation from the [[Segal Design Institute]] at the [[Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science]]. This seven-quarter program begins in the summer before the traditional fall start of a two-year program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Two-Year MBA|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/two-year-mba-program.aspx|website=www.kellogg.northwestern.edu|language=en}}</ref>\n\n====JD-MBA====\nIn cooperation with the Northwestern Pritzker School Law, Kellogg offers a program that leads to earning a JD and an MBA in just three years. Students spend their first year in law school where they study the standard curriculum. During the first summer and second-year, students study entirely at Kellogg. The second summer students choose to devote their time to either law or business entirely. During the final year, most classes are spent at the law school, but students may take some electives at the business school.<ref name=\"Law\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/jd-mba-program.aspx |title=JD-MBA Program |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Kellogg School of Management |publisher=Northwestern University |access-date=14 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==== Ph.D. programs ====\nKellogg awarded its first Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in 1927. Since then, more than 950 Kellogg Ph.D. alumni have gone on to positions within academia and business. Seven programs of study are offered: Accounting Information and Management, Finance, Management and Organizations, Management and Organizations and Sociology, Managerial Economics and Strategy, Marketing, and Operations Management. The program is full-time on the Evanston campus. Students typically graduate in five years.\n\n====Kellogg Asset Management Practicum====\nStudents declaring a finance major may choose to follow the asset management track, a special set of courses offered by the Kellogg finance department. At the core of the asset management track is a yearlong experiential learning course sequence, the Asset Management Practicum (FINC 933, 934, 935, and 936). In the practicum \u2013 a for-credit course with limited enrollment \u2013 students manage a portfolio under the guidance of faculty from the finance and accounting departments.

The exchange partner schools offer the chance to learn about business from a different perspective, experience another culture, and network with students, faculty, and professionals from around the world. The International Exchange Program at the Kellogg School was started in 1980 with a vision to promote a cultural interchange of ideas and provide a greater understanding of cross-cultural trade and business practices. Since that time, more than 1,000 Kellogg School students have participated in the exchange program with schools from over 20 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Thailand, and U.K.\n\nBeginning in 1996, Kellogg established joint Executive MBA programs with the Recanati Graduate School of Management at Tel Aviv University in Israel; WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China; the School of Business and Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; INSEAD campuses in France and Singapore; and the Schulich School of Management at York University in Toronto.\n\nThe Kellogg EMBA program offers students the opportunity to complete an elective course during Live-In Week at one of the Kellogg School's Global Partner Institutions in Tel Aviv, Israel; Vallendar, Germany; Toronto, Canada; or Hong Kong.\n\nKellogg offers joint executive MBA degree programs with\u2014and grant Kellogg degrees to\u2014these schools:\n\n*School of Business and Management at [[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] in Hong Kong\n*Recanati Graduate School of Management at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]]\n*[[WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management]] in Germany\n*[[Schulich School of Business]] at [[York University]] in Toronto, Canada\n*[[Guanghua School of Management]] at [[Peking University]] in Beijing, China<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guanghua.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|title=Guanghua \u2013 Kellogg}}</ref>\n\n=== Student profile ===\n46% of the students in Kellogg's full-time MBA program for the Class of 2020 are women.

Heilman]], a Northwestern graduate with a doctorate from Harvard, was appointed the dean of the school. And in the next year, the school launched a graduate program leading toward the Master of Business Administration degree, drawing nearly 400 students in its first two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://centennial.kellogg.northwestern.edu/index-timeline.html|title=Kellogg Centennial \u2013 Home}}</ref>\n\nIn 1939, [[Homer Vanderblue]] became the fifth dean of the school. During immense resource shortages caused by World War II, Dean Vanderblue kept the school functioning and led it through its transition from technical specialization toward a broader managerial education.\n\n=== Changes in focus and international expansion (1951 - 1978) ===\nIn 1951, the school began offering executive education courses. The Institute for Management, a four-week summer program based in Evanston, expanded the following year to two sections. The program's success eventually led to it being expanded in Europe in 1965 with a similar program offered in [[B\u00fcrgenstock]], [[Switzerland]]. In 1976, the school expanded its executive education offerings in Evanston, introducing a degree-granting program known as the Executive Management Program (EMP, today known as the Executive MBA Program). A watershed event in the school's history was the opening of the James L. Allen Center, home of the Kellogg executive education programs. The vision of Dean Donald P. Jacobs (deanship 1975\u20132001; on faculty in Finance Department since 1957), the Allen Center enlisted the help of significant business figures in the Chicago-area, most notably [[James L. Allen]], a Kellogg alumnus and co-founder of consultancy [[Booz Allen Hamilton]]. The Allen Center's cornerstone was laid in 1978 while the facility officially opened Oct 31, 1979.\n\nIn 1956, the school was renamed the School of Business; little more than a decade later, in 1969, the school once again changed its name, this time to the Graduate School of Management, a designation that reflected the demand among the business community for sophisticated managers trained in both analytical and behavioral skills. Also, this training was oriented toward general management, rather than narrowly functional skills, as had mostly been the case in many business schools for much of the 20th century. The training was designed to provide management skills suitable for leadership roles whether in the corporate, public, or nonprofit sectors \u2013 rather than careers focused solely on traditional business. To reflect this change, the school in 1969 stopped issuing the MBA credential in favor of the MM, or master of management degree. A point of differentiation for nearly three decades, the school more recently returned to the traditional MBA.<ref>Northwestern University: A History 1850\u20131975, Williamson, Harold F. and Payson S. Wild (Northwestern University Press, 1976), p. 122.</ref>\n\nThese dramatic changes were predicated upon a key change under Dean John Barr (1965\u20131975): In 1966, Northwestern elected to discontinue its highly respected undergraduate program (the ''School of Business'') to focus its energies solely on graduate education. The school decided to pursue a research-based faculty. It quickly attracted a number of world-class quantitative experts, many in the field of game theory, to build the school's Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences Department. This department was founded in 1967 and initially led by Professor [[Stanley Reiter]].<ref name=\"kellogg.northwestern.edu\"/><ref>{{cite journal|ssrn=1140111|title=Three Alternative (?)

The funds allowed the school to significantly expand its research and teaching mission by establishing three endowed professorships; two major centers of interdisciplinary research; four research professorships; and a large dormitory.

Within the E&W MBA program, Kellogg offers both an evening program and a weekend program. The E&W MBA requires 20.5 credits to complete. Kellogg also offers an accelerated option for students who have previous academic or industry experience in MBA-relevant subjects like accounting, marketing, and corporate finance. The accelerated option only requires 15.5 credits to complete. Students in the evening program typically take two classes per quarter, which allows them to finish the program in 2.5 years. The program must be completed within five years of starting, which can be accomplished by taking one class every quarter or by a combination of taking multiple classes per quarter and taking some quarters off. Classes for the evening & weekend program are offered at the downtown Chicago campus located at Wieboldt Hall, but students can take classes at the main campus as well.\n\n====Executive MBA====\nKellogg offers an Executive MBA program designed for senior and mid-career executives. Executives can choose between two campuses, Evanston and Miami, and also two schedules, one weekend a month or two weekends a month.\n\n====MMM====\nGraduates of the MMM program earn both an MBA from Kellogg and an MS in Design Innovation from the [[Segal Design Institute]] at the [[Robert R.

The exchange partner schools offer the chance to learn about business from a different perspective, experience another culture, and network with students, faculty, and professionals from around the world. The International Exchange Program at the Kellogg School was started in 1980 with a vision to promote a cultural interchange of ideas and provide a greater understanding of cross-cultural trade and business practices. Since that time, more than 1,000 Kellogg School students have participated in the exchange program with schools from over 20 countries, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile, China, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Thailand, and U.K.\n\nBeginning in 1996, Kellogg established joint Executive MBA programs with the Recanati Graduate School of Management at Tel Aviv University in Israel; WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany; Guanghua School of Management at Peking University in China; the School of Business and Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology; INSEAD campuses in France and Singapore; and the Schulich School of Management at York University in Toronto.\n\nThe Kellogg EMBA program offers students the opportunity to complete an elective course during Live-In Week at one of the Kellogg School's Global Partner Institutions in Tel Aviv, Israel; Vallendar, Germany; Toronto, Canada; or Hong Kong.\n\nKellogg offers joint executive MBA degree programs with\u2014and grant Kellogg degrees to\u2014these schools:\n\n*School of Business and Management at [[The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology]] in Hong Kong\n*Recanati Graduate School of Management at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]]\n*[[WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management]] in Germany\n*[[Schulich School of Business]] at [[York University]] in Toronto, Canada\n*[[Guanghua School of Management]] at [[Peking University]] in Beijing, China<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guanghua.kellogg.northwestern.edu/|title=Guanghua \u2013 Kellogg}}</ref>\n\n=== Student profile ===\n46% of the students in Kellogg's full-time MBA program for the Class of 2020 are women.

At the start of the race Hunter-Reay's steering failed and as a result Hunter-Reay drove straight into a sign along the track. The team made repairs to the car while the race was stopped for rain. Hunter-Reay would finish 18th, five laps down, due to the repairs and the crash. At the [[2011 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis 500]] the Andretti team struggled in practice. On Bump Day Hunter-Reay was bumped from the field by teammate [[Marco Andretti]] with 55 seconds left in qualifying. Andretti later made a deal with [[A.J.

Hunter-Reay inherited the lead when several other drivers who had led the race, such as [[Dario Franchitti]] and [[Takuma Sato]], were involved in crashes. Rain came in the late stages of the race. On lap 220 of 225 Hunter-Reay was leading [[Oriol Servi\u00e0]] when the race was restarted and almost immediately teammate [[Danica Patrick]] spun due to the rain and collected several cars making the race go back to a caution. During this time Servi\u00e0 took the lead. [[INDYCAR]] officials decided to revert the results to lap 215 when the race was under caution for the rain. Hunter-Reay's best finish following the New Hampshire race was a 5th at the [[2011 Kentucky Indy 300|Kentucky Indy 300]] at [[Kentucky Speedway]].

On lap 11 [[James Hinchcliffe]] was clipped by [[Wade Cunningham]]. Cunningham and [[J. R. Hildebrand]] then made contact when Cunningham swerved and Hildebrand drove over the rear of his car. Hildebrand's car became airborne and Cunningham collected [[Jay Howard]] on the inside and then [[Townsend Bell]] on the outside before crashing into the wall. Attempting to avoid the crash ahead, [[Vitor Meira]] lost control, spinning inward collecting both [[Charlie Kimball]] and [[E. J. Viso]]. At the same time Meira lost control, [[Tomas Scheckter]] was also attempting to avoid the first crash by rapidly slowing down on the outside. This led to [[Paul Tracy]] crashing into the back of Scheckter and a rapidly approaching [[Pippa Mann]] to launch over the top of Tracy after jerking to the outside to avoid crashing into [[Alex Lloyd]]. [[Dan Wheldon]] (who was attempting to win $5 million to split evenly with a fan courtesy of series sponsors [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[GoDaddy.com]]) had moved from 34th (last) place (due to the contest) to 24th when the crash occurred. Wheldon could only slow down from about 220 miles per hour to about 180 miles per hour. Wheldon would drive over Kimball's car and flip towards the catchfence and would hit one of the track's fence posts. Wheldon was pronounced dead on arrival of [[Blunt trauma|blunt force trauma]] at the [[University Medical Center of Southern Nevada]] at 1:54&nbsp;p.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Daylight Time]].

Hunter-Reay finished out the season ranked in 6th place in the final point standings with 102 points.\n\n===Indy car racing===\n\n====Champ Car World Series====\nHunter-Reay began to compete in the [[Champ Car|Bridgestone Presents the Champ Car World Series Powered by Ford]] in [[2003 CART season|2003]] to drive the #31 [[Stefan Johansson|American Spirit Team Johansson]] [[Reynard Motorsports|Reynard 02i]]-[[Ford]] [[Cosworth|Cosworth XFE]] for [[Stefan Johansson|American Spirit Team Johansson]], a team owned by former [[Formula One]] and [[Champ Car|Champ Car World Series]] driver [[Stefan Johansson]]. The previous year [[Reynard Motorsports]] filed for bankruptcy and the Champ Car program became owned by [[Walker Racing]]. The chassis struggled to compete with the [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola B02/00]]. The team also competed for the majority of the season without sponsorship. The only race that the team ran with sponsorship was the [[2003 Gran Premio Telmex-Gigante|Gran Premio Telmex-Gigante Presented by Banamex/VISA]] at [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez]] where the car ran with sponsorship from [[Gonher de Mexico]].

At the thirteenth race of the season, the [[2003 Champ Car Grand Prix of Mid-Ohio|Champ Car Grand Prix of Mid-Ohio]] at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course]] Hunter-Reay qualified in 2nd place and finished in 3rd place. Five races later at the season-ending [[2003 Lexmark Indy 300|Lexmark Indy 300]] at the [[Surfers Paradise Street Circuit]] Hunter-Reay started from twelfth place and would make his first of three mandatory pit stops to get [[Racing slick|slick tires]] as the track was changing from wet to dry in various parts of the track. Hunter-Reay would soon lead for 15 laps and would keep his car on the track while several other cars were crashing and/or spinning off of the track. Hunter-Reay would go on to win his first Champ Car race.\n\nHunter-Reay began to drive for [[HVM Racing|Herdez Competition]] in [[2004 Champ Car season|2004]] in the #4 [[Herdez]] [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola B02/00]]-[[Ford]] [[Cosworth|Cosworth XFE]].

Following the race Hunter-Reay was ranked third in points. Hunter-Reay's best finish in the remaining races was a 4th at the [[2004 Grand Prix of Road America|Grand Prix of Road America presented by the Chicago Tribune]] at [[Road America]]. In the race Hunter-Reay started second and made contact with former teammate [[Jimmy Vasser]] on the first lap and dropped the two to the rear of the field. Hunter-Reay charged up through the field to get fourth place while Vasser finished eighth. Hunter-Reay would finish ninth in points (the only time Hunter-Reay finished in the top 10 in points in Champ Car) with 199 points.\n\n[[Image:RyanHunter-Reay2005.jpg|thumb|left|Hunter-Reay at the [[Autosport International]] in 2005.]]\nIn [[2005 Champ Car season|2005]] Hunter-Reay began to drive for [[Rocketsports Racing]] in the #31 [[Lola Racing Cars|Lola B02/00]]-[[Ford]] [[Cosworth|Cosworth XFE]]. The car did not have consistent sponsorship and had to have sponsorship for various races from [[autobytel.com]], [[Briggs & Stratton]], [[Cytomax]] and [[Red Paw Systems]]. At the [[2005 Centrix Financial Grand Prix of Denver|Centrix Financial Grand Prix of Denver presented by PacifiCare]] at the [[Pepsi Center]] the car ran without sponsorship. Hunter-Reay's best finish during the season was a pair of 6th-place finishes at the [[2005 Molson Indy Toronto|Molson Indy Toronto]] at [[Exhibition Place]] and at Denver. Following the [[2005 Hurricane Relief 400|Hurricane Relief 400]] at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]], where Hunter-Reay started 16th and finished 10th, Hunter-Reay was replaced by [[Michael McDowell (racing driver)|Michael McDowell]] for the final two races of the season.

Prior to the season Hunter-Reay tested a car for [[HVM Racing]]. Hunter-Reay was eventually offered a position at [[Vision Racing]] to drive the #21 [[Vision Racing]] [[Dallara|Dallara IR07]]-[[Ilmor Engineering|Ilmor]]-[[Honda Indy V8|Indy V8 HI7R]]. The team had no sponsorship to start off the season, despite this Hunter-Reay managed to start 14th and finish 2nd at the season-opening [[2009 Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg|Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg]] on the [[Grand Prix of St. Petersburg|Streets of St. Petersburg]]. In the process Hunter-Reay gave Vision their best finish in an IndyCar Series race.

Hunter-Reay inherited the lead when several other drivers who had led the race, such as [[Dario Franchitti]] and [[Takuma Sato]], were involved in crashes. Rain came in the late stages of the race. On lap 220 of 225 Hunter-Reay was leading [[Oriol Servi\u00e0]] when the race was restarted and almost immediately teammate [[Danica Patrick]] spun due to the rain and collected several cars making the race go back to a caution. During this time Servi\u00e0 took the lead. [[INDYCAR]] officials decided to revert the results to lap 215 when the race was under caution for the rain. Hunter-Reay's best finish following the New Hampshire race was a 5th at the [[2011 Kentucky Indy 300|Kentucky Indy 300]] at [[Kentucky Speedway]].

On lap 11 [[James Hinchcliffe]] was clipped by [[Wade Cunningham]]. Cunningham and [[J. R. Hildebrand]] then made contact when Cunningham swerved and Hildebrand drove over the rear of his car. Hildebrand's car became airborne and Cunningham collected [[Jay Howard]] on the inside and then [[Townsend Bell]] on the outside before crashing into the wall. Attempting to avoid the crash ahead, [[Vitor Meira]] lost control, spinning inward collecting both [[Charlie Kimball]] and [[E. J. Viso]]. At the same time Meira lost control, [[Tomas Scheckter]] was also attempting to avoid the first crash by rapidly slowing down on the outside. This led to [[Paul Tracy]] crashing into the back of Scheckter and a rapidly approaching [[Pippa Mann]] to launch over the top of Tracy after jerking to the outside to avoid crashing into [[Alex Lloyd]]. [[Dan Wheldon]] (who was attempting to win $5 million to split evenly with a fan courtesy of series sponsors [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[GoDaddy.com]]) had moved from 34th (last) place (due to the contest) to 24th when the crash occurred.
