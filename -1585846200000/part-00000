He designed and manufactured the first airplane in [[Turkey]], and also founded the country's first airline company.\n\n== Biography ==\n[[File:Vecihi - War of Independence.jpg|thumb|175px|right|A portrait of Vecihi H\u00fcrku\u015f.]]\nBorn in Istanbul in 1896. His father was customs inspector Feham Bey, his mother was Zeliha Niyir, born in [[Vidin]]. His father died when he was 3 years old. He went to elementary school in [[Bebek, Be\u015fikta\u015f|Bebek]], F\u00fcyuzati Osmaniye R\u00fc\u015ftiye (middle school) in [[Uskudar]] and Pa\u015fakap\u0131s\u0131 \u0130dadi (high school). Then he finished Tophane Art School.\n \nWhen [[Balkan War]] started, he joined as volunteer. Upon his return, he was assigned as the commander of a POW camp in [[Beykoz]]. Then during World War I, in early 1916, he was sent to, [[Bagdat]], during [[Mesopotamia Campaign]] as a mechanic<ref>https://www.fikriyat.com/biyografi/2018/07/16/havacilikta-ilklerin-adami-vecihi-hurkus</ref>. He was sent back to Istanbul after he was injured. He subsequently joined Tayyare Mektebi, the Ottoman aviation school in [[Ye\u015filk\u00f6y]]. His first solo flight was on May 21, 1916. Soon after receiving his pilot certificate he joined 7th airplane company (Tayyare B\u00f6l\u00fc\u011f\u00fc) and commenced bombing and reconnaissance missions against the Russians on the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus front]]. In one of these [[sortie]]s, he shot down a Russian airplane, becoming the first Turkish pilot to bring down an enemy aircraft.\n\nHe was subsequently taken prisoner by the Russians but managed to escape from [[Nargin (island)|Nargin island]] to Iran by swimming with [[Azeri]] help and walking for over two months. Following his escape, he returned to Istanbul and joined the 9th combat aircraft squadron in 1918, assigned to protection of [[Istanbul]] from aerial attacks by Allies. He designed a fighter airplane but could not finish the project due to the terms contained within the [[Montreux]] Ceasefire Agreement. During the [[Turkish War of Independence]], in which he flew as a \"civilian pilot\", he held the equivalent rank of Captain. During this time he shot down a Greek airplane,<ref>http://www.kokpit.aero/index.php?route=article/article&article_id=4387</ref> and made the first and last flights of the war. In the last flight, he landed at [[Gaziemir|\u0130zmir Seydik\u00f6y]] Airfield, occupying it single-handedly.\n\nAfter the war, he designed and built his first airplane and a few other aircraft inside a converted [[saw mill]] which he had rented for that purpose. He used aircraft engines he had acquired during World War I to power the planes he manufactured. In 1924 he built a military aircraft from scratch in Izmir, Vecihi K-VI, which made its first flight on 28 January 1925. In 1930 he constructed a speedboat (Vecihi-SK-X) and a civilian aircraft (Vecihi K-XIV) in [[Kad\u0131k\u00f6y]], Istanbul, followed by a seaplane in 1933.\n\nOn 21 April 1932, he established a civilian flying school, Vecihi Sivil Tayyare Mektebi, in Kad\u0131k\u00f6y. The following year he trained the first Turkish female aviator, [[Bedriye Tahir G\u00f6kmen|Bedriye Bac\u0131 (G\u00f6kmen)]]. He adopted the surname H\u00fcrku\u015f (\"Freebird\") after the [[Surname Law]] of 1934. On 27 February 1939 he received a diploma in aircraft engineering from the [[Weimar Engineering School]] in [[Germany]].\n\nIn 1948 he established a privately-funded aviation publication entitled ''Kanatl\u0131lar Dergisi''. On 29 November 1954 he founded ''H\u00fcrku\u015f Havayollari'' (Freebird Airlines), the first private airline in Turkey.

In 1918 he manufactured a propeller from scratch in Istanbul, for a [[Nieuport 17]] also captured from the Russians. During the [[Turkish War of Independence]] he produced adhesive from [[gelatin]] to glue fabric to aircraft wings.\n\nIn 1923, in [[Edirne]], H\u00fcrku\u015f flew an abandoned Italian [[Caproni Ca.5#Variants|Caproni Ca.5 aka Ca.57 or Breda M-1]] with nine passengers, the first Turkish pilot to fly a passenger aircraft. He constructed the country's first gliders (US\u20134 ve PS\u20132), and played a role in the establishment of the Turkish Bird<ref>https://www.thk.org.tr/</ref> (Turkish Aviation Society) from 1935 to 1936 in [[Etimesgut]], Ankara.\n\nDuring his flying career, which spanned a period of 52 years (1916\u20131967), Vecihi H\u00fcrku\u015f flew a total of 102 different models of aircraft and spent 30,000 hours (3.4 years) in the cockpit.\n\n== Personal life ==\nDuring the War of Independence, Vecihi married Hadiye, the daughter of the chief of police in [[Ak\u015fehir]]. They had two daughters, G\u00f6n\u00fcl (H\u00fcrku\u015f \u015earman) and Sevim (H\u00fcrkus Maxson). In 1925, he divorced Hadiye and married his childhood sweetheart \u0130hsan.

Two separatrices (see text) divide space into four magnetic domains with a separator at the center of the figure. Field lines (and associated plasma) flow inward from above and below the separator, reconnect, and spring outward horizontally. A current sheet (as shown) may be present but is not required for reconnection to occur. This process is not well understood: once started, it proceeds many orders of magnitude faster than predicted by standard models.]]\n\n[[File:Quad-flare.ogv|thumb|380px|The evolution of magnetic reconnection during a [[solar flare]].<ref>Zhu et al., 2016, ApJ, 821, L29, http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8205/821/2/L29</ref>]]\n\n'''Magnetic reconnection''' is a physical process occurring in highly conducting [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] in which the magnetic [[topology]] is rearranged and magnetic energy is converted to [[kinetic energy]], [[thermal energy]], and [[particle acceleration]].  Magnetic reconnection occurs on timescales intermediate between slow resistive diffusion of the [[magnetic field]] and fast [[Alfv\u00e9n wave|Alfv\u00e9nic]] timescales.\n\nAccording to simple resistive [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD) theory, reconnection happens because the plasma's [[resistivity|electrical resistivity]] near the boundary layer opposes the [[current (electricity)|current]]s necessary to sustain the change in the magnetic field.  The need for such a current can be seen from one of [[Maxwell's equations]],\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{J} + \\mu \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}.</math>\n\nThe resistivity of the current layer allows [[magnetic flux]] from either side to diffuse through the current layer, cancelling outflux from the other side of the boundary.  When this happens, the plasma is pulled out by [[Magnetic tension force|magnetic tension]] along the direction of the magnetic field lines.  The resulting drop in pressure pulls more plasma and magnetic flux into the central region, yielding a self-sustaining process.\n\nA current problem in plasma [[physics]] is that observed reconnection happens much faster than predicted by MHD in high [[Lundquist number]] plasmas (i.e. '''fast magnetic reconnection'''). [[Solar flare]]s, for example, proceed 13\u201314 orders of magnitude faster than a naive calculation would suggest, and several orders of magnitude faster than current theoretical models that include turbulence and kinetic effects.  One possible mechanism to explain the discrepancy is that the electromagnetic [[turbulence]] in the boundary layer is sufficiently strong to scatter electrons, raising the plasma's local resistivity.  This would allow the magnetic flux to diffuse faster.\n\n== Properties ==\n[[File:SDO Observes a Reconnection Event.ogg|thumb|380px|A magnetic reconnection event on the [[sun]].]]\n\n=== Physical interpretation ===\nThe qualitative description of the reconnection process is such that [[magnetic field lines]] from different [[magnetic domain]]s (defined by the field line connectivity) are spliced to one another, changing their patterns of connectivity with respect to the sources.  It is a violation of an approximate conservation law in plasma physics, called [[Alfv\u00e9n's theorem]], and can concentrate mechanical or magnetic energy in both space and time. Solar flares, the largest explosions in the [[Solar System]], may involve the reconnection of large systems of magnetic flux on the [[Sun]], releasing, in minutes, energy that has been stored in the magnetic field over a period of hours to days.  Magnetic reconnection in [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]] is one of the mechanisms responsible for the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], and it is important to the science of controlled [[nuclear fusion]] because it is one mechanism preventing [[magnetic confinement]] of the fusion fuel.\n\nIn an electrically conductive [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], magnetic field lines are grouped into 'domains'\u2014\u2009bundles of field lines that connect from a particular place to another particular place, and that are topologically distinct from other field lines nearby.  This topology is approximately preserved even when the magnetic field itself is strongly distorted by the presence of variable currents or motion of magnetic sources, because effects that might otherwise change the magnetic topology instead induce [[eddy current]]s in the plasma; the eddy currents have the effect of canceling out the topological change.\n\n=== Types of reconnection ===\nIn two dimensions, the most common type of magnetic reconnection is '''separator reconnection''', in which four separate magnetic domains exchange magnetic field lines.  Domains in a magnetic plasma are separated by ''[[Separatrix (Math)|separatrix]] surfaces'': curved surfaces in space that divide different bundles of flux. Field lines on one side of the separatrix all terminate at a particular magnetic pole, while field lines on the other side all terminate at a different pole of similar sign.  Since each field line generally begins at a north magnetic pole and ends at a south magnetic pole, the most general way of dividing simple flux systems involves four domains separated by two separatrices: one separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a south pole, and the other separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a north pole.  The intersection of the separatrices forms a ''separator'', a single line that is at the boundary of the four separate domains.  In separator reconnection, field lines enter the separator from two of the domains, and are spliced one to the other, exiting the separator in the other two domains (see the first figure).\n\nIn three dimensions, the geometry of the field lines become more complicated than the two-dimensional case and it is possible for reconnection to occur in regions where a separator does not exist, but with the field lines connected by steep gradients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Priest|first=E.

Sweet pointed out that by pushing two plasmas with oppositely directed magnetic fields together, resistive diffusion is able to occur on a length scale much shorter than a typical equilibrium length scale.<ref>Sweet, P. A., The Neutral Point Theory of Solar Flares, in IAU Symposium 6, Electromagnetic Phenomena in Cosmical Physics, ed. B. Lehnert (Dordrecht: Kluwer), 123, 1958</ref> Parker was in attendance at this conference and developed scaling relations for this model during his return travel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=E. N.|date=December 1957|title=Sweet's mechanism for merging magnetic fields in conducting fluids|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=62|issue=4|pages=509\u2013520|doi=10.1029/JZ062i004p00509|bibcode=1957JGR....62..509P}}</ref>\n\nThe Sweet\u2013Parker model describes time-independent magnetic reconnection in the resistive MHD framework when the reconnecting magnetic fields are antiparallel (oppositely directed) and effects related to viscosity and compressibility are unimportant.  The initial velocity is simply an <math>E\\times B</math> velocity, so\n: <math>E_y = v_\\text{in} B_\\text{in}</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_y</math> is the out-of-plane electric field, <math>v_\\text{in}</math> is the characteristic inflow velocity, and <math>B_\\text{in}</math> is the characteristic upstream magnetic field strength.  By neglecting displacement current, the low-frequency Ampere's law, <math>\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}</math>, gives the relation\n: <math>J_y \\sim \\frac{B_\\text{in}}{\\mu_0\\delta},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\delta</math> is the current sheet half-thickness.  This relation uses that the magnetic field reverses over a distance of <math>\\sim2\\delta</math>.  By matching the ideal electric field outside of the layer with the resistive electric field <math>\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\mathbf{J}</math> inside the layer (using [[Ohm's law]]), we find that\n: <math>v_\\text{in} = \\frac{E_y}{B_\\text{in}} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\mu_0\\sigma\\delta} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\eta</math> is the [[magnetic diffusivity]].  When the inflow density is comparable to the outflow density, conservation of mass yields the relationship\n: <math>v_\\text{in}L \\sim v_\\text{out}\\delta, </math>\n\nwhere <math>L</math> is the half-length of the current sheet and <math>v_\\text{out}</math> is the outflow velocity.  The left and right hand sides of the above relation represent the mass flux into the layer and out of the layer, respectively.  Equating the upstream magnetic pressure with the downstream [[dynamic pressure]] gives\n: <math>\\frac{B_\\text{in}^2}{2\\mu_0} \\sim \\frac{\\rho v_\\text{out}^2}{2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the mass density of the plasma.  Solving for the outflow velocity then gives\n: <math>v_\\text{out} \\sim \\frac{B_\\text{in}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\rho}} \\equiv v_A</math>\n\nwhere <math>v_A</math> is the [[Alfv\u00e9n wave|Alfv\u00e9n velocity]].  With the above relations, the dimensionless reconnection rate <math>R</math> can then be written in two forms, the first in terms of <math>(\\eta, \\delta, v_A)</math> using the result earlier derived from Ohm's law, the second in terms of <math>(\\delta, L)</math> from the conservation of mass as\n: <math>R = \\frac{v_\\text{in}}{v_\\text{out}} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{v_A\\delta} \\sim \\frac{\\delta}{L}.</math>\n\nSince the dimensionless [[Lundquist number]] <math>S</math> is given by\n: <math>S \\equiv \\frac{Lv_A}{\\eta},</math>\n\nthe two different expressions of <math>R</math> are multiplied by each other and then square-rooted, giving a simple relation between the reconnection rate <math>R</math> and the Lundquist number <math>S</math>\n: <math>R ~ \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta}{v_A L}} = \\frac{1}{S^\\frac{1}{2}}.</math>\n\nSweet\u2013Parker reconnection allows for reconnection rates much faster than global diffusion, but is not able to explain the fast reconnection rates observed in solar flares, the Earth's magnetosphere, and laboratory plasmas.  Additionally, Sweet\u2013Parker reconnection neglects three-dimensional effects, collisionless physics, time-dependent effects, viscosity, compressibility, and downstream pressure.  Numerical simulations of two-dimensional magnetic reconnection typically show agreement with this model.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Biskamp|first=D.|date=1986|title=Magnetic reconnection via current sheets|journal=Physics of Fluids|language=en|volume=29|issue=5|pages=1520|doi=10.1063/1.865670|issn=0031-9171|bibcode=1986PhFl...29.1520B}}</ref>  Results from the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) of collisional reconnection show agreement with a generalized Sweet\u2013Parker model which incorporates compressibility, downstream pressure and anomalous resistivity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Hantao|last2=Yamada|first2=Masaaki|last3=Hsu|first3=Scott|last4=Kulsrud|first4=Russell|last5=Carter|first5=Troy|last6=Zaharia|first6=Sorin|date=26 April 1999|title=Magnetic reconnection with Sweet-Parker characteristics in two-dimensional laboratory plasmas|journal=Physics of Plasmas|language=en|volume=6|issue=5|pages=1743\u20131750|doi=10.1063/1.873432|issn=1070-664X|bibcode=1999PhPl....6.1743J|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc681346/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Hantao|last2=Yamada|first2=Masaaki|last3=Hsu|first3=Scott|last4=Kulsrud|first4=Russell|date=1998|title=Experimental Test of the Sweet-Parker Model of Magnetic Reconnection|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=80|issue=15|pages=3256\u20133259|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.3256|bibcode=1998PhRvL..80.3256J|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc675424/}}</ref>\n\n===Fast reconnection: Petschek model===\n\nOne of the reasons why Sweet\u2013Parker reconnection is slow is that the aspect ratio of the reconnection layer is very large in high Lundquist number plasmas.  The inflow velocity, and thus the reconnection rate, must then be very small.  In 1964, Harry Petschek proposed a mechanism where the inflow and outflow regions are separated by stationary slow mode shocks.<ref>Petschek, H. E., Magnetic Field Annihilation, in The Physics of Solar Flares, Proceedings of the AAS-NASA Symposium held 28\u201330 October 1963 at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, p. 425, 1964</ref>  The aspect ratio of the diffusion region is then of order unity and the maximum reconnection rate becomes\n: <math>\\frac{v_\\text{in}}{v_A} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{8 \\ln S}.</math>\n\nThis expression allows for fast reconnection and is almost independent of the Lundquist number.\n\nSimulations of resistive MHD reconnection with uniform resistivity showed the development of elongated current sheets in agreement with the Sweet\u2013Parker model rather than the Petschek model.  When a localized anomalously large resistivity is used, however, Petschek reconnection can be realized in resistive MHD simulations.  Because the use of an anomalous resistivity is only appropriate when the particle mean free path is large compared to the reconnection layer, it is likely that other collisionless effects become important before Petschek reconnection can be realized.\n\n===Anomalous resistivity and Bohm diffusion===\n\nIn the Sweet\u2013Parker model, the common assumption is that the [[magnetic diffusivity]] is constant. This can be estimated using the equation of motion for an electron with mass <math>m</math> and electric charge <math>e</math>:\n\n:<math>{d{\\mathbf{v}} \\over dt} = {e \\over m}\\mathbf{E} - \\nu\\mathbf{v},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\nu</math> is the collision frequency. Since in the steady state, <math>d{\\mathbf{v}}/dt = 0</math>, then the above equation along with the definition of electric current, <math>{\\mathbf{J}} = en{\\mathbf{v}}</math>, where <math>n </math> is the electron number density, yields\n\n:<math>\\eta = \\nu{c^2 \\over \\omega_{pi}^2}.</math>\n\nNevertheless, if the drift velocity of electrons exceeds the thermal velocity of plasma, a steady state cannot be achieved and magnetic diffusivity should be much larger than what is given in the above. This is called anomalous resistivity, <math>\\eta_\\text{anom}</math>, which can enhance the reconnection rate in the Sweet\u2013Parker model by a factor of <math>\\eta_\\text{anom}/\\eta</math>.\n\nAnother proposed mechanism is known as the Bohm diffusion across the magnetic field. This replaces the Ohmic resistivity with <math>v_A^2 (mc/eB)</math>, however, its effect, similar to the anomalous resistivity, is still too small compared with the observations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=E.

This stochastic model is independent of small scale physics such as resistive effects.

On these scales, the [[Hall effect]] becomes important.  Two-fluid simulations show the formation of an X-point geometry rather than the double Y-point geometry characteristic of resistive reconnection.  The [[electron]]s are then accelerated to very high speeds by [[Electromagnetic electron wave|Whistler waves]].  Because the ions can move through a wider \"bottleneck\" near the current layer and because the electrons are moving much faster in Hall MHD than in [[Magnetohydrodynamics|standard MHD]], reconnection may proceed more quickly.  Two-fluid/collisionless reconnection is particularly important in the Earth's magnetosphere.\n\n== Observations of magnetic reconnection in nature and the laboratory ==\n\n===Solar atmosphere===\n\nMagnetic reconnection occurs during [[solar flare]]s, [[coronal mass ejection]]s, and many other events in the solar atmosphere.  The observational evidence for solar flares includes observations of inflows/outflows, downflowing loops, and changes in the magnetic topology.

It has observed numerous reconnection events in which the Earth's magnetic field reconnects with that of the Sun (i.e. the [[Interplanetary Magnetic Field]]). These include 'reverse reconnection' that causes sunward convection in the Earth's [[ionosphere]] near the polar cusps; 'dayside reconnection', which allows the transmission of particles and energy into the Earth's vicinity and 'tail reconnection', which causes auroral [[substorm]]s by injecting particles deep into the magnetosphere and releasing the energy stored in the Earth's magnetotail.  The [[Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission]], launched on 13 March 2015, improved the spatial and temporal resolution of the Cluster II results by having a tighter constellation of spacecraft. This led to a better understanding of the behavior of the electrical currents in the electron diffusion region.\n\nOn 26 February 2008, [[THEMIS]] probes were able to determine the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html|title=THEMIS Satellites Discover What Triggers Eruptions of the Northern Lights|website=NASA}}</ref> Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the Moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.<ref>{{cite journal|url=|title=Tail Reconnection Triggering Substorm Onset|author=Vassilis Angelopoulos|doi=10.1126/science.1160495|pmid=18653845|volume=321|issue=5891|pages=931\u2013935|journal=Science|bibcode = 2008Sci...321..931A |year=2008}}</ref> Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos of the University of California, Los Angeles, who is the principal investigator for the THEMIS mission, claimed, \"Our data show clearly and for the first time that magnetic reconnection is the trigger.\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/080724-themis-aurora-mystery.html|title=Secret of Colorful Auroras Revealed|website=Space.com}}</ref>\n\n===Laboratory plasma experiments===\n\nMagnetic reconnection has also been observed in numerous laboratory experiments.

Magnetic reconnection occurs on timescales intermediate between slow resistive diffusion of the [[magnetic field]] and fast [[Alfv\u00e9n wave|Alfv\u00e9nic]] timescales.\n\nAccording to simple resistive [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD) theory, reconnection happens because the plasma's [[resistivity|electrical resistivity]] near the boundary layer opposes the [[current (electricity)|current]]s necessary to sustain the change in the magnetic field.  The need for such a current can be seen from one of [[Maxwell's equations]],\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{J} + \\mu \\epsilon \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}.</math>\n\nThe resistivity of the current layer allows [[magnetic flux]] from either side to diffuse through the current layer, cancelling outflux from the other side of the boundary.  When this happens, the plasma is pulled out by [[Magnetic tension force|magnetic tension]] along the direction of the magnetic field lines.  The resulting drop in pressure pulls more plasma and magnetic flux into the central region, yielding a self-sustaining process.\n\nA current problem in plasma [[physics]] is that observed reconnection happens much faster than predicted by MHD in high [[Lundquist number]] plasmas (i.e. '''fast magnetic reconnection'''). [[Solar flare]]s, for example, proceed 13\u201314 orders of magnitude faster than a naive calculation would suggest, and several orders of magnitude faster than current theoretical models that include turbulence and kinetic effects.  One possible mechanism to explain the discrepancy is that the electromagnetic [[turbulence]] in the boundary layer is sufficiently strong to scatter electrons, raising the plasma's local resistivity.  This would allow the magnetic flux to diffuse faster.\n\n== Properties ==\n[[File:SDO Observes a Reconnection Event.ogg|thumb|380px|A magnetic reconnection event on the [[sun]].]]\n\n=== Physical interpretation ===\nThe qualitative description of the reconnection process is such that [[magnetic field lines]] from different [[magnetic domain]]s (defined by the field line connectivity) are spliced to one another, changing their patterns of connectivity with respect to the sources.  It is a violation of an approximate conservation law in plasma physics, called [[Alfv\u00e9n's theorem]], and can concentrate mechanical or magnetic energy in both space and time. Solar flares, the largest explosions in the [[Solar System]], may involve the reconnection of large systems of magnetic flux on the [[Sun]], releasing, in minutes, energy that has been stored in the magnetic field over a period of hours to days.  Magnetic reconnection in [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]] is one of the mechanisms responsible for the [[Aurora (astronomy)|aurora]], and it is important to the science of controlled [[nuclear fusion]] because it is one mechanism preventing [[magnetic confinement]] of the fusion fuel.\n\nIn an electrically conductive [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], magnetic field lines are grouped into 'domains'\u2014\u2009bundles of field lines that connect from a particular place to another particular place, and that are topologically distinct from other field lines nearby.  This topology is approximately preserved even when the magnetic field itself is strongly distorted by the presence of variable currents or motion of magnetic sources, because effects that might otherwise change the magnetic topology instead induce [[eddy current]]s in the plasma; the eddy currents have the effect of canceling out the topological change.\n\n=== Types of reconnection ===\nIn two dimensions, the most common type of magnetic reconnection is '''separator reconnection''', in which four separate magnetic domains exchange magnetic field lines.  Domains in a magnetic plasma are separated by ''[[Separatrix (Math)|separatrix]] surfaces'': curved surfaces in space that divide different bundles of flux. Field lines on one side of the separatrix all terminate at a particular magnetic pole, while field lines on the other side all terminate at a different pole of similar sign.  Since each field line generally begins at a north magnetic pole and ends at a south magnetic pole, the most general way of dividing simple flux systems involves four domains separated by two separatrices: one separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a south pole, and the other separatrix surface divides the flux into two bundles, each of which shares a north pole.  The intersection of the separatrices forms a ''separator'', a single line that is at the boundary of the four separate domains.  In separator reconnection, field lines enter the separator from two of the domains, and are spliced one to the other, exiting the separator in the other two domains (see the first figure).\n\nIn three dimensions, the geometry of the field lines become more complicated than the two-dimensional case and it is possible for reconnection to occur in regions where a separator does not exist, but with the field lines connected by steep gradients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Priest|first=E.

Sweet pointed out that by pushing two plasmas with oppositely directed magnetic fields together, resistive diffusion is able to occur on a length scale much shorter than a typical equilibrium length scale.<ref>Sweet, P. A., The Neutral Point Theory of Solar Flares, in IAU Symposium 6, Electromagnetic Phenomena in Cosmical Physics, ed. B. Lehnert (Dordrecht: Kluwer), 123, 1958</ref> Parker was in attendance at this conference and developed scaling relations for this model during his return travel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Parker|first=E. N.|date=December 1957|title=Sweet's mechanism for merging magnetic fields in conducting fluids|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=62|issue=4|pages=509\u2013520|doi=10.1029/JZ062i004p00509|bibcode=1957JGR....62..509P}}</ref>\n\nThe Sweet\u2013Parker model describes time-independent magnetic reconnection in the resistive MHD framework when the reconnecting magnetic fields are antiparallel (oppositely directed) and effects related to viscosity and compressibility are unimportant.  The initial velocity is simply an <math>E\\times B</math> velocity, so\n: <math>E_y = v_\\text{in} B_\\text{in}</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_y</math> is the out-of-plane electric field, <math>v_\\text{in}</math> is the characteristic inflow velocity, and <math>B_\\text{in}</math> is the characteristic upstream magnetic field strength.  By neglecting displacement current, the low-frequency Ampere's law, <math>\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_0}\\nabla\\times\\mathbf{B}</math>, gives the relation\n: <math>J_y \\sim \\frac{B_\\text{in}}{\\mu_0\\delta},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\delta</math> is the current sheet half-thickness.  This relation uses that the magnetic field reverses over a distance of <math>\\sim2\\delta</math>.  By matching the ideal electric field outside of the layer with the resistive electric field <math>\\mathbf{E} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}\\mathbf{J}</math> inside the layer (using [[Ohm's law]]), we find that\n: <math>v_\\text{in} = \\frac{E_y}{B_\\text{in}} \\sim \\frac{1}{\\mu_0\\sigma\\delta} = \\frac{\\eta}{\\delta},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\eta</math> is the [[magnetic diffusivity]].  When the inflow density is comparable to the outflow density, conservation of mass yields the relationship\n: <math>v_\\text{in}L \\sim v_\\text{out}\\delta, </math>\n\nwhere <math>L</math> is the half-length of the current sheet and <math>v_\\text{out}</math> is the outflow velocity.  The left and right hand sides of the above relation represent the mass flux into the layer and out of the layer, respectively.  Equating the upstream magnetic pressure with the downstream [[dynamic pressure]] gives\n: <math>\\frac{B_\\text{in}^2}{2\\mu_0} \\sim \\frac{\\rho v_\\text{out}^2}{2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\rho</math> is the mass density of the plasma.  Solving for the outflow velocity then gives\n: <math>v_\\text{out} \\sim \\frac{B_\\text{in}}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\rho}} \\equiv v_A</math>\n\nwhere <math>v_A</math> is the [[Alfv\u00e9n wave|Alfv\u00e9n velocity]].  With the above relations, the dimensionless reconnection rate <math>R</math> can then be written in two forms, the first in terms of <math>(\\eta, \\delta, v_A)</math> using the result earlier derived from Ohm's law, the second in terms of <math>(\\delta, L)</math> from the conservation of mass as\n: <math>R = \\frac{v_\\text{in}}{v_\\text{out}} \\sim \\frac{\\eta}{v_A\\delta} \\sim \\frac{\\delta}{L}.</math>\n\nSince the dimensionless [[Lundquist number]] <math>S</math> is given by\n: <math>S \\equiv \\frac{Lv_A}{\\eta},</math>\n\nthe two different expressions of <math>R</math> are multiplied by each other and then square-rooted, giving a simple relation between the reconnection rate <math>R</math> and the Lundquist number <math>S</math>\n: <math>R ~ \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta}{v_A L}} = \\frac{1}{S^\\frac{1}{2}}.</math>\n\nSweet\u2013Parker reconnection allows for reconnection rates much faster than global diffusion, but is not able to explain the fast reconnection rates observed in solar flares, the Earth's magnetosphere, and laboratory plasmas.  Additionally, Sweet\u2013Parker reconnection neglects three-dimensional effects, collisionless physics, time-dependent effects, viscosity, compressibility, and downstream pressure.  Numerical simulations of two-dimensional magnetic reconnection typically show agreement with this model.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Biskamp|first=D.|date=1986|title=Magnetic reconnection via current sheets|journal=Physics of Fluids|language=en|volume=29|issue=5|pages=1520|doi=10.1063/1.865670|issn=0031-9171|bibcode=1986PhFl...29.1520B}}</ref>  Results from the Magnetic Reconnection Experiment (MRX) of collisional reconnection show agreement with a generalized Sweet\u2013Parker model which incorporates compressibility, downstream pressure and anomalous resistivity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Hantao|last2=Yamada|first2=Masaaki|last3=Hsu|first3=Scott|last4=Kulsrud|first4=Russell|last5=Carter|first5=Troy|last6=Zaharia|first6=Sorin|date=26 April 1999|title=Magnetic reconnection with Sweet-Parker characteristics in two-dimensional laboratory plasmas|journal=Physics of Plasmas|language=en|volume=6|issue=5|pages=1743\u20131750|doi=10.1063/1.873432|issn=1070-664X|bibcode=1999PhPl....6.1743J|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc681346/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ji|first=Hantao|last2=Yamada|first2=Masaaki|last3=Hsu|first3=Scott|last4=Kulsrud|first4=Russell|date=1998|title=Experimental Test of the Sweet-Parker Model of Magnetic Reconnection|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=80|issue=15|pages=3256\u20133259|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.80.3256|bibcode=1998PhRvL..80.3256J|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc675424/}}</ref>\n\n===Fast reconnection: Petschek model===\n\nOne of the reasons why Sweet\u2013Parker reconnection is slow is that the aspect ratio of the reconnection layer is very large in high Lundquist number plasmas.  The inflow velocity, and thus the reconnection rate, must then be very small.  In 1964, Harry Petschek proposed a mechanism where the inflow and outflow regions are separated by stationary slow mode shocks.<ref>Petschek, H. E., Magnetic Field Annihilation, in The Physics of Solar Flares, Proceedings of the AAS-NASA Symposium held 28\u201330 October 1963 at the Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, p. 425, 1964</ref>  The aspect ratio of the diffusion region is then of order unity and the maximum reconnection rate becomes\n: <math>\\frac{v_\\text{in}}{v_A} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{8 \\ln S}.</math>\n\nThis expression allows for fast reconnection and is almost independent of the Lundquist number.\n\nSimulations of resistive MHD reconnection with uniform resistivity showed the development of elongated current sheets in agreement with the Sweet\u2013Parker model rather than the Petschek model.  When a localized anomalously large resistivity is used, however, Petschek reconnection can be realized in resistive MHD simulations.  Because the use of an anomalous resistivity is only appropriate when the particle mean free path is large compared to the reconnection layer, it is likely that other collisionless effects become important before Petschek reconnection can be realized.\n\n===Anomalous resistivity and Bohm diffusion===\n\nIn the Sweet\u2013Parker model, the common assumption is that the [[magnetic diffusivity]] is constant. This can be estimated using the equation of motion for an electron with mass <math>m</math> and electric charge <math>e</math>:\n\n:<math>{d{\\mathbf{v}} \\over dt} = {e \\over m}\\mathbf{E} - \\nu\\mathbf{v},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\nu</math> is the collision frequency. Since in the steady state, <math>d{\\mathbf{v}}/dt = 0</math>, then the above equation along with the definition of electric current, <math>{\\mathbf{J}} = en{\\mathbf{v}}</math>, where <math>n </math> is the electron number density, yields\n\n:<math>\\eta = \\nu{c^2 \\over \\omega_{pi}^2}.</math>\n\nNevertheless, if the drift velocity of electrons exceeds the thermal velocity of plasma, a steady state cannot be achieved and magnetic diffusivity should be much larger than what is given in the above. This is called anomalous resistivity, <math>\\eta_\\text{anom}</math>, which can enhance the reconnection rate in the Sweet\u2013Parker model by a factor of <math>\\eta_\\text{anom}/\\eta</math>.\n\nAnother proposed mechanism is known as the Bohm diffusion across the magnetic field. This replaces the Ohmic resistivity with <math>v_A^2 (mc/eB)</math>, however, its effect, similar to the anomalous resistivity, is still too small compared with the observations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Parker|first1=E.

On these scales, the [[Hall effect]] becomes important.  Two-fluid simulations show the formation of an X-point geometry rather than the double Y-point geometry characteristic of resistive reconnection.  The [[electron]]s are then accelerated to very high speeds by [[Electromagnetic electron wave|Whistler waves]].  Because the ions can move through a wider \"bottleneck\" near the current layer and because the electrons are moving much faster in Hall MHD than in [[Magnetohydrodynamics|standard MHD]], reconnection may proceed more quickly.  Two-fluid/collisionless reconnection is particularly important in the Earth's magnetosphere.\n\n== Observations of magnetic reconnection in nature and the laboratory ==\n\n===Solar atmosphere===\n\nMagnetic reconnection occurs during [[solar flare]]s, [[coronal mass ejection]]s, and many other events in the solar atmosphere.  The observational evidence for solar flares includes observations of inflows/outflows, downflowing loops, and changes in the magnetic topology. In the past, observations of the solar atmosphere were done using remote imaging; consequently, the magnetic fields were inferred or extrapolated rather than observed directly. However, the first direct observations of solar magnetic reconnection were gathered in 2012 (and released in 2013) by the [[High Resolution Coronal Imager]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azonano.com/news.aspx?newsID=26419|title=High-Resolution Coronal Imager Photographs the Sun in UV Light at 19.3nm Wavelength|publisher=AZonano.com|date=January 24, 2013|accessdate= February 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Earth's magnetosphere===\n\nMagnetic reconnection events that occur in the Earth's [[magnetosphere]] (in the dayside [[magnetopause]] and in the [[magnetotail]]) were observed by spacecrafts such as [[Cluster mission|Cluster II]]<ref>[http://clusterlaunch.esa.int/science-e/www/area/index.cfm?fareaid=8 Articles on measurements made from the Cluster II spacecraft mission]</ref> and the [[Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burch|first=J.

It has observed numerous reconnection events in which the Earth's magnetic field reconnects with that of the Sun (i.e. the [[Interplanetary Magnetic Field]]). These include 'reverse reconnection' that causes sunward convection in the Earth's [[ionosphere]] near the polar cusps; 'dayside reconnection', which allows the transmission of particles and energy into the Earth's vicinity and 'tail reconnection', which causes auroral [[substorm]]s by injecting particles deep into the magnetosphere and releasing the energy stored in the Earth's magnetotail.  The [[Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission]], launched on 13 March 2015, improved the spatial and temporal resolution of the Cluster II results by having a tighter constellation of spacecraft. This led to a better understanding of the behavior of the electrical currents in the electron diffusion region.\n\nOn 26 February 2008, [[THEMIS]] probes were able to determine the triggering event for the onset of magnetospheric substorms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/auroras/themis_power.html|title=THEMIS Satellites Discover What Triggers Eruptions of the Northern Lights|website=NASA}}</ref> Two of the five probes, positioned approximately one third the distance to the Moon, measured events suggesting a magnetic reconnection event 96 seconds prior to auroral intensification.<ref>{{cite journal|url=|title=Tail Reconnection Triggering Substorm Onset|author=Vassilis Angelopoulos|doi=10.1126/science.1160495|pmid=18653845|volume=321|issue=5891|pages=931\u2013935|journal=Science|bibcode = 2008Sci...321..931A |year=2008}}</ref> Dr. Vassilis Angelopoulos of the University of California, Los Angeles, who is the principal investigator for the THEMIS mission, claimed, \"Our data show clearly and for the first time that magnetic reconnection is the trigger.\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/080724-themis-aurora-mystery.html|title=Secret of Colorful Auroras Revealed|website=Space.com}}</ref>\n\n===Laboratory plasma experiments===\n\nMagnetic reconnection has also been observed in numerous laboratory experiments.

He later achieved the rank of brigadier general in the American Army and served during the [[War of 1812]], until he was killed during the [[Battle of York]], in April 1813, outside the then [[Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonial capital of [[Upper Canada]] (later Toronto, [[Ontario]]).\n\n==Early and family life==\n\n===Early life and education===\nPike was born during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], on January 5, 1779, near Lamberton,<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Washington |last=Irving |title=Biographical Memoir of the Late Brigadier General Zebulon Montgomery Pike |magazine=[[Analectic Magazine]] |volume=4 |date=November 1814 |page=380}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Wilson |title=The Biography of the Principal American Military and Naval Heroes; Comprehending Details of Their Achievements During the Revolutionary and Late Wars |volume=II |edition=Second |location=New York |publisher=John Low |year=1822 |page=9}}</ref> now called [[Lamington, New Jersey|Lamington]] in [[Bedminster, New Jersey]],<ref>{{cite journal |first=William J. |last=Backes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XUMVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=General Zebulon M.

General [[James Wilkinson]], appointed Governor of the Upper [[Louisiana Territory]] and headquartered there, became his mentor.\n\nIn 1796 Pike shadowed the expedition of General [[Georges Henri Victor Collot]], a French officer who had been tasked to tour the Mississippi frontier, and draw maps that France might use if it were to try and seize this lightly settled territory from the nascent USA.<ref name=Herald-Leader2017-03-19/>\n\n===First Pike Expedition===\nIn the summer of 1805, Wilkinson ordered Pike to locate the source of the [[Mississippi River]], explore the northern portion of the newly created [[Louisiana Territory]], and expel Canadian fur traders illegally trading in the borders of the United States. Pike left St. Louis on August 9, 1805, proceeding upstream by [[pirogue]]. They reached the [[Pike Island|confluence]] of the Mississippi and [[Minnesota River]]s on September 21, where he negotiated a [[Pike's Purchase|treaty]] with the [[Dakota people|Dakota]], purchasing the future site of [[Fort Snelling]]. The expedition proceeded further upriver, stopping to construct a winter camp at the mouth of the Swan River, south of present-day [[Little Falls, Minnesota|Little Falls]], on October 16. On December 10, they continued upstream along the now-frozen river on foot, visiting a number of British [[North West Company]] fur posts along the way.\n\nThey reached the fur post at [[Leech Lake]] on February 1, and stayed nearly three weeks. Pike informed the traders they were within the boundaries of the United States, and henceforth required to abide by its laws and regulations. Pike met with many prominent [[Ojibwe]] chiefs, prevailing on them to surrender the medals and flags given to them as tokens of allegiance by the British, and offering American replacement [[Indian Peace Medal|medals]]. He also relayed the United States' desire that the Ojibwe and Dakota cease their mutual hostility, and invited the chiefs to attend a peace conference in St. Louis (all declined the invitation to travel through several thousand miles of hostile territory). On February 10, they ceremonially shot the [[British ensign|British red ensign]] from the fur company's flag pole, replacing it with an [[Star-Spangled Banner (flag)|American flag]]. On a short side trip (February 12 to 14), Pike traveled to the North West Company fur post on [[Cass Lake (Minnesota)|Upper Red Cedar Lake]] (now commonly known as Cass Lake), erroneously designating the lake as the ultimate source of the Mississippi, and taking celestial observations to determine its [[latitude]].\n\nPike and his men left [[Leech Lake]] on February 18, carrying diplomatic tokens from the Ojibwe chiefs to present to the Dakota chiefs as a gesture of reconciliation, arriving at their winter encampment on March 5. They re-embarked in their pirogues for the downriver journey on April 7, reaching St. Louis on April 20. Pike's was the second expedition dispatched by the government into its new territory, and the first to return.\n\n===Second Pike Expedition===\n{{main|Pike expedition}}\n[[File:Pikes Peak by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pikes Peak]], central Colorado]]\nAfter Pike returned from this first expedition, General Wilkinson almost immediately ordered him to mount a second expedition, this time to explore, map, and find the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and Red rivers. Additional objectives of this exploratory expedition into the southwestern part of the Louisiana Territory were to evaluate natural resources and establish friendly relations with Native Americans.\n\nBeginning July 15, 1806, Pike led what became known as the \"Pike Expedition\". General Wilkinson's son James served as one of his lieutenants, although it now seems that Wilkinson planned that the Spanish who controlled Mexico would capture him and his men.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn early November 1806, Pike and his team sighted and tried to climb to the summit of the peak later named after him ([[Pikes Peak]]). They made it as far as Mt. Rosa, located southeast of Pikes Peak, before giving up the ascent in waist-deep snow. They had already gone almost two days without food.\n\nThey then continued south, searching for the Red River's headwaters, and built a fort for shelter during the winter. However, they had crossed the border, whether through confusion or deliberation. [[Spain|Spanish]] authorities captured Pike and some of his party in what was then northern New Mexico (now part of southern [[Colorado]]) on February 26, 1807.\n\nPike and his men were taken to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] then to the capital of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] province, and presented to Commandant General Salcedo, who was governor of the state.<ref>{{cite web |last=Buescher |first=John |url=http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290 |title=Trailing Lewis and Clark |publisher=TeachingHistory.org |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> Pike was treated well and invited to formal social dinners, but still not quite given the treatment of a visiting dignitary, and his men were kept prisoner. Salcedo housed Pike with Juan Pedro Walker, a cartographer who also acted as an  interpreter. Walker transcribed and translated Pike's confiscated documents, including his journal. Spanish authorities feared the spread of both democracy and Protestant Christian sects that might undermine their rule.\n\nDuring this time, Pike had access to various maps of the southwest and learned about Mexico's discontent with Spanish rule. Spain filed official protests with the United States about Pike's expedition, but since the nations were not at war (and Spain was rebelling against Napoleon's brother, who was fighting England in the [[Peninsular War]]), Commandant Salcedo released the military men. The Spanish escorted Pike and most of his men north, releasing them at the Louisiana border on July 1, 1807. However, some of Pike's soldiers were held for years in Mexico.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===War of 1812===\nPike was promoted to captain during the southwestern expedition. In 1811, Lt. Col. Zebulon M. Pike with the 4th Infantry Regiment fought at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. He was promoted to colonel of the 15th Infantry Regiment in July 1812. Pike's military career also included service as deputy [[quartermaster]]-general in [[New Orleans]] and [[inspector-general]] during the [[War of 1812]].\n\nPike was promoted to brigadier general in March 1813.<ref name=\"collier\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Valkenburg |first=Samuel Van |editor=William D.

On this expedition, Pike commanded combat troops in the [[Battle of York|successful attack]] on [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now [[Toronto]]), on April 27, 1813. Pike was killed, along with numerous other American troops, by flying rocks and other debris when the withdrawing British garrison blew up its ammunition magazine as Pike's troops approached Fort York.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Peppiatt|first1=Liam|title=Chapter 31B: Fort York|url=http://www.landmarksoftoronto.com/fort-york/|website=Robertson's Landmarks of Toronto}}</ref>  His body was brought by ship back to Sackets Harbor, where his remains were buried at the military cemetery.<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=2nN0DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=zebulon+pike+sackets+harbor+cemetery&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYzoS_35bfAhWEJjQIHfZoDgQQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=zebulon%20pike%20sackets%20harbor%20cemetery&f=false ''Graves of Upstate New York'']</ref>\n\n==Journals==\nThe Spanish authorities confiscated Pike's journals, which were not recovered by the United States from Mexico until the 1900s. Pike wrote an account from memory of his expeditions, which was published in 1810 as ''The expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike to Headwaters of the Mississippi River, through Louisiana Territory, and in New Spain, during the Years 1805-6-7''.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XrMlAAAAMAAJ |title=The expeditions of Zebulon Montgomery Pike to headwaters of the Mississippi River, through Louisiana Territory, and in New Spain, during the years 1805-6-7 |first=Zebulon Montgomery |last=Pike |editor=Elliott Coues |publisher=Ross & Haines |year=1965 |publication-date=1895}}</ref> It was popular; was later translated into [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], and [[German language|German]] editions; and became required reading for all American explorers who followed him in the 19th century.\n\nPike's capture by the Spanish and travel through the Southwest gave Pike insight into the region. For example, he described the politics in Chihuahua, which led to the [[Mexican independence]] movement, and described trade conditions in the Spanish territories of New Mexico and Chihuahua, which contributed to development of the [[Santa Fe Trail]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn some eastern regions of North America a tradition or legend pervades often referred to as ''The Lost City of Palanor'' or ''Zebulon's Amulet'' which has been attributed to Pike's journals. The myth, said to be derived from a missing portion of Pike's confiscated journals, is usually told in two segments. The first sequence involves Pike receiving an amulet from a native chieftain as a reward for the rescue of the chief's daughter. The second is a description of Pike's discovery of the lost city \"Palanor,\" said to be built by pre-Columbian European settlers, and his decision to bury the amulet there.\n\n==Legacy==\nAs Olsen (2006) shows, after Pike's death in battle, his military accomplishments were widely celebrated in terms of biographies, mourning memorials, paintings, poems, and songs, and he became the namesake for dozens of towns, counties, and ships. His memory faded after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] but rebounded in 1906, at the centennial of his Southwest Expedition. His 20th-century reputation focused on his exploration, and his name appeared often on natural features, such as dams, islands, lakes, and parks.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael L. |last=Olsen |title=Zebulon Pike and American Popular Culture \u2013 or \u2013 Has Pike Peaked? |journal=Kansas History |date=Spring 2006 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=48\u201359 |url=https://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/2006spring_olsen.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPike was honored in 1901 by [[William Jackson Palmer|General William Jackson Palmer]] with a marble statue placed near the main entrance of the Antlers Hotel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=William J.

General [[James Wilkinson]], appointed Governor of the Upper [[Louisiana Territory]] and headquartered there, became his mentor.\n\nIn 1796 Pike shadowed the expedition of General [[Georges Henri Victor Collot]], a French officer who had been tasked to tour the Mississippi frontier, and draw maps that France might use if it were to try and seize this lightly settled territory from the nascent USA.<ref name=Herald-Leader2017-03-19/>\n\n===First Pike Expedition===\nIn the summer of 1805, Wilkinson ordered Pike to locate the source of the [[Mississippi River]], explore the northern portion of the newly created [[Louisiana Territory]], and expel Canadian fur traders illegally trading in the borders of the United States. Pike left St. Louis on August 9, 1805, proceeding upstream by [[pirogue]]. They reached the [[Pike Island|confluence]] of the Mississippi and [[Minnesota River]]s on September 21, where he negotiated a [[Pike's Purchase|treaty]] with the [[Dakota people|Dakota]], purchasing the future site of [[Fort Snelling]]. The expedition proceeded further upriver, stopping to construct a winter camp at the mouth of the Swan River, south of present-day [[Little Falls, Minnesota|Little Falls]], on October 16. On December 10, they continued upstream along the now-frozen river on foot, visiting a number of British [[North West Company]] fur posts along the way.\n\nThey reached the fur post at [[Leech Lake]] on February 1, and stayed nearly three weeks. Pike informed the traders they were within the boundaries of the United States, and henceforth required to abide by its laws and regulations. Pike met with many prominent [[Ojibwe]] chiefs, prevailing on them to surrender the medals and flags given to them as tokens of allegiance by the British, and offering American replacement [[Indian Peace Medal|medals]]. He also relayed the United States' desire that the Ojibwe and Dakota cease their mutual hostility, and invited the chiefs to attend a peace conference in St. Louis (all declined the invitation to travel through several thousand miles of hostile territory). On February 10, they ceremonially shot the [[British ensign|British red ensign]] from the fur company's flag pole, replacing it with an [[Star-Spangled Banner (flag)|American flag]]. On a short side trip (February 12 to 14), Pike traveled to the North West Company fur post on [[Cass Lake (Minnesota)|Upper Red Cedar Lake]] (now commonly known as Cass Lake), erroneously designating the lake as the ultimate source of the Mississippi, and taking celestial observations to determine its [[latitude]].\n\nPike and his men left [[Leech Lake]] on February 18, carrying diplomatic tokens from the Ojibwe chiefs to present to the Dakota chiefs as a gesture of reconciliation, arriving at their winter encampment on March 5. They re-embarked in their pirogues for the downriver journey on April 7, reaching St. Louis on April 20. Pike's was the second expedition dispatched by the government into its new territory, and the first to return.\n\n===Second Pike Expedition===\n{{main|Pike expedition}}\n[[File:Pikes Peak by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pikes Peak]], central Colorado]]\nAfter Pike returned from this first expedition, General Wilkinson almost immediately ordered him to mount a second expedition, this time to explore, map, and find the headwaters of the [[Arkansas River|Arkansas]] and Red rivers. Additional objectives of this exploratory expedition into the southwestern part of the Louisiana Territory were to evaluate natural resources and establish friendly relations with Native Americans.\n\nBeginning July 15, 1806, Pike led what became known as the \"Pike Expedition\". General Wilkinson's son James served as one of his lieutenants, although it now seems that Wilkinson planned that the Spanish who controlled Mexico would capture him and his men.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn early November 1806, Pike and his team sighted and tried to climb to the summit of the peak later named after him ([[Pikes Peak]]). They made it as far as Mt. Rosa, located southeast of Pikes Peak, before giving up the ascent in waist-deep snow. They had already gone almost two days without food.\n\nThey then continued south, searching for the Red River's headwaters, and built a fort for shelter during the winter. However, they had crossed the border, whether through confusion or deliberation. [[Spain|Spanish]] authorities captured Pike and some of his party in what was then northern New Mexico (now part of southern [[Colorado]]) on February 26, 1807.\n\nPike and his men were taken to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] then to the capital of [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] province, and presented to Commandant General Salcedo, who was governor of the state.<ref>{{cite web |last=Buescher |first=John |url=http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24290 |title=Trailing Lewis and Clark |publisher=TeachingHistory.org |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> Pike was treated well and invited to formal social dinners, but still not quite given the treatment of a visiting dignitary, and his men were kept prisoner. Salcedo housed Pike with Juan Pedro Walker, a cartographer who also acted as an  interpreter. Walker transcribed and translated Pike's confiscated documents, including his journal. Spanish authorities feared the spread of both democracy and Protestant Christian sects that might undermine their rule.\n\nDuring this time, Pike had access to various maps of the southwest and learned about Mexico's discontent with Spanish rule. Spain filed official protests with the United States about Pike's expedition, but since the nations were not at war (and Spain was rebelling against Napoleon's brother, who was fighting England in the [[Peninsular War]]), Commandant Salcedo released the military men. The Spanish escorted Pike and most of his men north, releasing them at the Louisiana border on July 1, 1807. However, some of Pike's soldiers were held for years in Mexico.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===War of 1812===\nPike was promoted to captain during the southwestern expedition. In 1811, Lt. Col. Zebulon M. Pike with the 4th Infantry Regiment fought at the [[Battle of Tippecanoe]]. He was promoted to colonel of the 15th Infantry Regiment in July 1812. Pike's military career also included service as deputy [[quartermaster]]-general in [[New Orleans]] and [[inspector-general]] during the [[War of 1812]].\n\nPike was promoted to brigadier general in March 1813.<ref name=\"collier\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Valkenburg |first=Samuel Van |editor=William D.

For example, he described the politics in Chihuahua, which led to the [[Mexican independence]] movement, and described trade conditions in the Spanish territories of New Mexico and Chihuahua, which contributed to development of the [[Santa Fe Trail]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nIn some eastern regions of North America a tradition or legend pervades often referred to as ''The Lost City of Palanor'' or ''Zebulon's Amulet'' which have been attributed to Pike's journals. The myth, said to be derived from a missing portion of Pike's confiscated journals, is usually told in two segments. The first sequence involves Pike receiving an amulet from a native chieftain as a reward for the rescue of the chief's daughter. The second is a description of Pike's discovery of the lost city \"Palanor,\" said to be built by pre-Columbian European settlers, and his decision to bury the amulet there.\n\n==Legacy==\nAs Olsen (2006) shows, after Pike's death in battle, his military accomplishments were widely celebrated in terms of biographies, mourning memorials, paintings, poems, and songs, and he became the namesake for dozens of towns, counties, and ships. His memory faded after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] but rebounded in 1906, at the centennial of his Southwest Expedition. His 20th-century reputation focused on his exploration, and his name appeared often on natural features, such as dams, islands, lakes, and parks.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Michael L. |last=Olsen |title=Zebulon Pike and American Popular Culture \u2013 or \u2013 Has Pike Peaked? |journal=Kansas History |date=Spring 2006 |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=48\u201359 |url=https://www.kshs.org/publicat/history/2006spring_olsen.pdf}}</ref>\n\nPike was honored in 1901 by [[William Jackson Palmer|General William Jackson Palmer]] with a marble statue placed near the main entrance of the Antlers Hotel.<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=William J.

{"title_page": "Bering Sea Arbitration", "text_new": "The '''Bering Sea Arbitration of 1893''' arose out of a [[fishery]] dispute between the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and the [[United States]] in the 1880s. The [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], today known as the [[United States Coast Guard]], captured several Canadian sealer vessels throughout the conflict. Diplomatic representations followed the capture of the first three ships and an order for release was issued by the British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the [[Dominion of Canada]]), but it did nothing to stop the seizures and none were released. This led to the U.S. claiming exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the [[Bering Sea]], and that led to negotiations outside of the courts. The award was given in favor of the British, however, and the Americans were denied exclusive jurisdiction. The British were awarded compensation for the damage that had been inflicted on their vessels, and the American sealing zone remained as it was prior to the conflict (60 miles).\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1867 the United States government purchased from [[Russia]] all her territorial rights in [[Alaska]] and the adjacent islands. The boundary between the two countries was a line drawn from the middle of the [[Bering Strait]] south-west to a point midway between the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] and [[Komandorski Islands]] dividing the Bering Sea into two parts, the larger being on the American side. This portion included the [[Pribilof Islands]], the principal breeding-grounds of the seals in those seas.\n\nBy [[Acts of Congress]], passed between 1868 and 1873, the killing of seals was prohibited on the Pribilof Islands and in \"the waters adjacent thereto\" except upon certain specified conditions. This created a large swathe of friction between the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government with the [[presidential veto]] employed by [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on two notable occasions.   No definition of the meaning of the words \"waters adjacent\" was given in the act. In 1870 the exclusive rights of killing seals on these islands was leased by the United States to the [[Alaska Commercial Company]], on conditions limiting the numbers to be taken annually, and otherwise providing for their protection. As early as 1872, the operations of foreign sealers attracted the attention of the United States' government, but any precautions then taken seem to have been directed against the capture of seals on their way through the passages between the Aleutian Islands, and no claim to jurisdiction beyond the three-mile limit appears to have been made. On March 12, 1881, the acting [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], in answer to a letter asking for an interpretation of the words \"waters adjacent thereto\" in the acts of 1868 and 1873, stated that all the waters east of the boundary line were considered to be within the waters of Alaska territory. In March 1886 this letter was communicated to the [[San Francisco]] [[customs]] by [[Daniel Manning]], U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, for publication.\n\nBeginning in about 1886, it became the practice of certain Canadian vessels to intercept passing seals in the open ocean (over three miles from any shore) and shoot them in the water (pelagic sealing), often killing both male and female.<ref name=nie/> The great drawback of pelagic sealing lies in the fact that nursing seal mothers wander far in search of food, while the males do not take food during the breeding season, but remain on the islands. Consequently, practically all the seals taken by pelagic sealers are nursing females, the death of which ordinarily results in the starvation of the pups.<ref>{{Cite NIE |last=Clark |first=Hubert Lyman |authorlink=Hubert Lyman Clark |wstitle=Seal (mammal)|display=Seal. A carnivorous aquatic mammal of the suborder Pinnipedia }}</ref> As a result of this practice, the real possibility of the destruction of the seal fisheries became apparent, together with industries valuable to both the United States and Great Britain.<ref name=nie/>\n\n==British involvement and escalation==\nIn the summer of 1886, three British Columbian sealers, ''Carolena'', ''Onward'', and ''Thornton'', were captured by an American revenue cutter, [[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|''Corwin'']], 60 miles from land.<ref>[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII \"The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration\"''] E.O.S. Scholefield and F.W. Howay, S.J. Clarke Publ. Co, Vancouver, 1914, p. 461.</ref><ref name=Strobridge&Noble18-19>Strobridge and Noble, pp 18\u201319</ref> They were condemned by the district judge because they had been sealing within the limits of Alaska territory and owed  [[Prima facie|a pro tanto obligation]] to respect the sovereign laws of the [[Territory of Alaska]]. Diplomatic representations followed and an order for release was issued but, in 1887, further captures were made which were judicially supported on the same grounds. From that point the United States claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the Bering Sea; it also contended that the protection of the [[fur seal]] was an international duty, and should be secured by international arrangement. The British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada) repudiated the claim, but was willing to negotiate on the question of international regulation.\n\n==Negotiations==\nBetween 1887 and 1890, negotiations were carried out among Russia, Great Britain and the United States with a view to a joint convention but the parties were unable to agree on basis for regulating sealing in the open seas, the [[pelagic zone]].<ref name=Strobridge&Noble18-19 /> America had seal nurseries on the Pribilof Islands and Russia on the Komandorski group. Neither Britain, nor the Dominion of Canada, had land access to the Bering Sea or seal breeding grounds. Thus, to prohibit pelagic sealing would have been to exclude Britain from the industry.\n\nThe United States insisted that such prohibition was indispensable on the grounds that pelagic sealing involved the destruction of breeding stock, because it was practically impossible to distinguish between the male and female seal when in the water; and that it was unnecessarily wasteful, inasmuch as a large proportion of the seals so killed were lost. Britain contended that in all known cases the extermination of seals had been the result of operations upon land, and had never been caused exclusively by sealing in the pelagic zone.\n\nThe negotiations came to nothing, and the United States fell back upon their claim of right. In June 1890, it was reported that certain American revenue cutters had been ordered to proceed to the Bering Sea. Sir [[Julian Pauncefote]], the British ambassador at [[Washington, DC|Washington]], having failed to obtain an assurance that British vessels would not be interfered with, laid a formal protest before the United States government.\n\n==Arbitration==\nThere followed a diplomatic controversy, in the course of which the United States developed the contentions which were afterwards laid before the tribunal of arbitration. The claim that Bering Sea was ''[[mare clausum]]'' was abandoned, but it was asserted that Russia had formerly exercised therein rights of exclusive jurisdiction which had passed to the United States, and they relied ''[[inter alia]]'' upon the [[ukase]] of 1821, by which foreign vessels had been forbidden to approach within 100 Italian miles of the coasts of Russian America. It was pointed out by Great Britain that this ukase had been the subject of protest both by Great Britain and the United States, and that by treaties similar in their terms, made between Russia and each of the protesting powers, Russia had agreed that their subjects should not be troubled or molested in navigating or fishing in any part of the Pacific Ocean. The American answer was that the [[Pacific Ocean]] did not include the Bering Sea. They also claimed an interest in the fur seals, involving the right to protect them outside the three-mile limit. In August 1890 [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] proposed that the question at issue should be submitted to arbitration. This was ultimately assented to by the secretary of state, [[James Gillespie Blaine]], on the understanding that certain specific\npoints, which he indicated, should be laid before the arbitrators.\n\nOn February 29, 1892, a definitive treaty was signed at Washington, D.C. Each power was to name two arbitrators, and the president of the [[France|French]] Republic, the king of [[Italy]], the king of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] were each to name one.\n\n===Terms of reference and arbitrators===\nThe points submitted were\n#What exclusive jurisdiction in the sea now known as Bering Sea, and what exclusive rights in the seal fisheries therein, did Russia assert and exercise prior to and up to the time of the cession of Alaska to the United States? \n#How far were her claims of jurisdiction as to the seal fisheries recognized and conceded by Great Britain? \n#Was the body of water now known as Bering Sea included in the phrase \"Pacific Ocean\", as used in the treaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, and what rights, if any, in Bering Sea were held exclusively exercised by Russia after the said treaty? \n#Did not all the rights of Russia as to jurisdiction and as to the seal fisheries in Bering Sea east of the water boundary, in the treaty between the United States and Russia of the 30th of  March 1867, pass unimpaired to the United States under that treaty? \n#Had the United States any and what right of protection over, or property in, the fur seals frequenting the islands of Bering Sea when such seals are found outside the three-mile limit?\n\nIn the event of a determination in favour of Great Britain the arbitrators were to determine what concurrent regulations were necessary for the preservation of the seals, and a joint commission was to be appointed by the two powers to assist them in the investigation of the facts of seal life. The question of damages was reserved for further discussion, but either party was to be at liberty to submit any question of fact to the arbitrators, and to ask for a finding thereon. The tribunal was to sit at [[Paris]]. The treaty was approved by the [[United States Senate]] on the March 29, 1892, and ratified by the president on April 22.\n\nThe United States appointed as arbitrator Mr. [[John Marshall Harlan|John M. Harlan]], a justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], and Mr [[John T. Morgan]], a member of the Senate. The British arbitrators were [[Lord Hannen]] and [[Sir John Sparrow David Thompson]]. The neutral arbitrators were the Baron de Courcel, the [[Emilio, marquis Visconti-Venosta|Marquis Visconti-Venosta]], and Mr. [[Gregers Winther Wulfsberg Gram]], appointed respectively by the president of the French Republic, the king of Italy, and the king of Norway and Sweden. The sittings of the tribunal began in February 1893 and ended in August.  [[Henry Williams Blodgett]] acted as U.S. counsel before the tribunal.\n\n===Main arguments===\nWhen the evidence was before the tribunal, it was plain that the United States had a very weak case with regard to the claim of exclusive jurisdiction in the Bering Sea (the first claim), and it was not strongly pressed by the counsel of the United States.<ref name=nie>{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Sealing}}</ref> The real question, therefore, and the one upon which the chief argument was directed, was the second of the two claims put forward on behalf of the United States, the right of property in the seals and the right of protecting them beyond the three-mile limit.\n\nIt was suggested that the seals had some of the characteristics of the domestic animals, and could therefore be the subject of something in the nature of a right of property. They were so far amenable to human control that it was possible to take their increase without destroying the stock. Sealing upon land was legitimate sealing; the United States being the owners of the land, the industry was a trust vested in them for the benefit of mankind. On the other hand, pelagic sealing, being a method of promiscuous slaughter, was illegitimate; it was ''contra bonos mores'' and analogous to piracy. Consequently, the United States claimed a right to restrain such practices, both as proprietors of the seals and as proprietors and trustees of the legitimate industry.\n\nSuch a right to restrain was a novelty hitherto unrecognized by any system of law. [[James C. Carter]], therefore, as counsel for the United States, submitted a theory of international jurisprudence which was equally novel. He argued that the determination of the tribunal must be grounded upon \"the principles of right,\" that \"by the rule or principle of right was meant a moral rule dictated by the general standard of justice upon which civilized nations are agreed, that this international standard of justice is but another name for international law, that the particular recognized rules were but cases of the application of a more general rule, and that where the particular rules were silent the general rule applied.\" The practical result of giving effect to this contention would be that an international tribunal could make new law and apply it retrospectively. Carter's contention was successfully combated by [[Charles Russell, Baron Russell of Killowen|Charles Russell]], the leading counsel for Great Britain.\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe award, which was signed and published on 15 August 1893, was in favour of Great Britain on all points. The question of damages, which had been reserved, was ultimately settled by a mixed commission appointed by the two powers in February 1896, the total amount awarded to the British sealers being $473,151.26 - in excess of US$10 million in present-day inflation-adjusted dollars.\n\nSince the decision was in favor of Great Britain, in accordance with the arbitration treaty the tribunal prescribed a series of regulations for preserving the seal herds which were to be binding upon and enforced by both powers. They limited pelagic sealing as to time, place, and manner by fixing a zone of 60 miles around the Pribilof Islands within which the seals were not to be molested at any time, and from May 1 to July 31 each year they were not to be pursued anywhere in Bering Sea. Only licensed sailing vessels were permitted to engage in fur sealing, and the use of firearms or explosives was prohibited. The regulations were to remain in force until abolished by mutual agreement, but were to be examined every five years with a view to modification.<ref name=nie/>\n\nThese regulations, however, failed of their object, because the mother seals did not feed within the protected area, but far outside of it. The mother seals were therefore taken by the pelagic sealers as before, and their young were left to starve.

The [[United States Revenue Cutter Service]], today known as the [[United States Coast Guard]], captured several Canadian sealer vessels throughout the conflict. Diplomatic representations followed the capture of the first three ships and an order for release was issued by the British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the [[Dominion of Canada]]), but it did nothing to stop the seizures and none were released. This led to the U.S. claiming exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the [[Bering Sea]], and that led to negotiations outside of the courts. The award was given in favor of the British, however, and the Americans were denied exclusive jurisdiction. The British were awarded compensation for the damage that had been inflicted on their vessels, and the American sealing zone remained as it was prior to the conflict (60 miles).\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1867 the United States government purchased from [[Russia]] all her territorial rights in [[Alaska]] and the adjacent islands. The boundary between the two countries was a line drawn from the middle of the [[Bering Strait]] south-west to a point midway between the [[Aleutian Islands|Aleutian]] and [[Komandorski Islands]] dividing the Bering Sea into two parts, the larger being on the American side. This portion included the [[Pribilof Islands]], the principal breeding-grounds of the seals in those seas.\n\nBy [[Acts of Congress]], passed between 1868 and 1873, the killing of seals was prohibited on the Pribilof Islands and in \"the waters adjacent thereto\" except upon certain specified conditions. This created a large swathe of friction between the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government with the [[presidential veto]] employed by [[Ulysses S. Grant]] on two notable occasions.   No definition of the meaning of the words \"waters adjacent\" was given in the act. In 1870 the exclusive rights of killing seals on these islands was leased by the United States to the [[Alaska Commercial Company]], on conditions limiting the numbers to be taken annually, and otherwise providing for their protection. As early as 1872, the operations of foreign sealers attracted the attention of the United States' government, but any precautions then taken seem to have been directed against the capture of seals on their way through the passages between the Aleutian Islands, and no claim to jurisdiction beyond the three-mile limit appears to have been made. On March 12, 1881, the acting [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]], in answer to a letter asking for an interpretation of the words \"waters adjacent thereto\" in the acts of 1868 and 1873, stated that all the waters east of the boundary line were considered to be within the waters of Alaska territory. In March 1886 this letter was communicated to the [[San Francisco]] [[customs]] by [[Daniel Manning]], U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, for publication.\n\nBeginning in about 1886, it became the practice of certain Canadian vessels to intercept passing seals in the open ocean (over three miles from any shore) and shoot them in the water (pelagic sealing), often killing both male and female.<ref name=nie/> The great drawback of pelagic sealing lies in the fact that nursing seal mothers wander far in search of food, while the males do not take food during the breeding season, but remain on the islands. Consequently, practically all the seals taken by pelagic sealers are nursing females, the death of which ordinarily results in the starvation of the pups.<ref>{{Cite NIE |last=Clark |first=Hubert Lyman |authorlink=Hubert Lyman Clark |wstitle=Seal (mammal)|display=Seal. A carnivorous aquatic mammal of the suborder Pinnipedia }}</ref> As a result of this practice, the real possibility of the destruction of the seal fisheries became apparent, together with industries valuable to both the United States and Great Britain.<ref name=nie/>\n\n==British involvement and escalation==\nIn the summer of 1886, three British Columbian sealers, ''Carolena'', ''Onward'', and ''Thornton'', were captured by an American revenue cutter, [[USRC Thomas Corwin (1876)|''Corwin'']], 60 miles from land.<ref>[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3724963 ''British Columbia: From the Earliest Times to the Present, Vol .2, Chapter XXVII \"The Sealing Industry and the Behring Sea Arbitration\"''] E.O.S. Scholefield and F.W. Howay, S.J. Clarke Publ. Co, Vancouver, 1914, p. 461.</ref><ref name=Strobridge&Noble18-19>Strobridge and Noble, pp 18\u201319</ref> They were condemned by the district judge because they had been sealing within the limits of Alaska territory and owed  [[Prima facie|a pro tanto obligation]] to respect the sovereign laws of the [[Territory of Alaska]]. Diplomatic representations followed and an order for release was issued but, in 1887, further captures were made which were judicially supported on the same grounds. From that point the United States claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the sealing industry in the Bering Sea; it also contended that the protection of the [[fur seal]] was an international duty, and should be secured by international arrangement. The British imperial government (then still in charge of foreign affairs for the Dominion of Canada) repudiated the claim, but was willing to negotiate on the question of international regulation.\n\n==Negotiations==\nBetween 1887 and 1890, negotiations were carried out among Russia, Great Britain and the United States with a view to a joint convention but the parties were unable to agree on basis for regulating sealing in the open seas, the [[pelagic zone]]. America had seal nurseries on the Pribilof Islands and Russia on the Komandorski group. Neither Britain, nor the Dominion of Canada, had land access to the Bering Sea or seal breeding grounds. Thus, to prohibit pelagic sealing would have been to exclude Britain from the industry.\n\nThe United States insisted that such prohibition was indispensable on the grounds that pelagic sealing involved the destruction of breeding stock, because it was practically impossible to distinguish between the male and female seal when in the water; and that it was unnecessarily wasteful, inasmuch as a large proportion of the seals so killed were lost. Britain contended that in all known cases the extermination of seals had been the result of operations upon land, and had never been caused exclusively by sealing in the pelagic zone.\n\nThe negotiations came to nothing, and the United States fell back upon their claim of right. In June 1890, it was reported that certain American revenue cutters had been ordered to proceed to the Bering Sea. Sir [[Julian Pauncefote]], the British ambassador at [[Washington, DC|Washington]], having failed to obtain an assurance that British vessels would not be interfered with, laid a formal protest before the United States government.\n\n==Arbitration==\nThere followed a diplomatic controversy, in the course of which the United States developed the contentions which were afterwards laid before the tribunal of arbitration. The claim that Bering Sea was ''[[mare clausum]]'' was abandoned, but it was asserted that Russia had formerly exercised therein rights of exclusive jurisdiction which had passed to the United States, and they relied ''[[inter alia]]'' upon the [[ukase]] of 1821, by which foreign vessels had been forbidden to approach within 100 Italian miles of the coasts of Russian America. It was pointed out by Great Britain that this ukase had been the subject of protest both by Great Britain and the United States, and that by treaties similar in their terms, made between Russia and each of the protesting powers, Russia had agreed that their subjects should not be troubled or molested in navigating or fishing in any part of the Pacific Ocean. The American answer was that the [[Pacific Ocean]] did not include the Bering Sea. They also claimed an interest in the fur seals, involving the right to protect them outside the three-mile limit. In August 1890 [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] proposed that the question at issue should be submitted to arbitration. This was ultimately assented to by the secretary of state, [[James Gillespie Blaine]], on the understanding that certain specific\npoints, which he indicated, should be laid before the arbitrators.\n\nOn February 29, 1892, a definitive treaty was signed at Washington, D.C. Each power was to name two arbitrators, and the president of the [[France|French]] Republic, the king of [[Italy]], the king of [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] were each to name one.\n\n===Terms of reference and arbitrators===\nThe points submitted were\n#What exclusive jurisdiction in the sea now known as Bering Sea, and what exclusive rights in the seal fisheries therein, did Russia assert and exercise prior to and up to the time of the cession of Alaska to the United States? \n#How far were her claims of jurisdiction as to the seal fisheries recognized and conceded by Great Britain? \n#Was the body of water now known as Bering Sea included in the phrase \"Pacific Ocean\", as used in the treaty of 1825 between Great Britain and Russia, and what rights, if any, in Bering Sea were held exclusively exercised by Russia after the said treaty? \n#Did not all the rights of Russia as to jurisdiction and as to the seal fisheries in Bering Sea east of the water boundary, in the treaty between the United States and Russia of the 30th of  March 1867, pass unimpaired to the United States under that treaty? \n#Had the United States any and what right of protection over, or property in, the fur seals frequenting the islands of Bering Sea when such seals are found outside the three-mile limit?\n\nIn the event of a determination in favour of Great Britain the arbitrators were to determine what concurrent regulations were necessary for the preservation of the seals, and a joint commission was to be appointed by the two powers to assist them in the investigation of the facts of seal life. The question of damages was reserved for further discussion, but either party was to be at liberty to submit any question of fact to the arbitrators, and to ask for a finding thereon. The tribunal was to sit at [[Paris]]. The treaty was approved by the [[United States Senate]] on the March 29, 1892, and ratified by the president on April 22.\n\nThe United States appointed as arbitrator Mr. [[John Marshall Harlan|John M.

{"title_page": "Morgan dollar", "text_new": "{{about|the United States dollar coin|the NASCAR team formerly known as Morgan-Dollar Motorsports|Randy Moss Motorsports}}The NOT NICE '''Morgan dollar''' was a [[United States dollar coin]] minted from 1878 to 1904, and  again in 1921. It was the first standard silver dollar minted since production of the previous design, the [[Seated Liberty dollar]], ceased due to the passage of the [[Coinage Act of 1873]], which also ended the [[Free silver|free coining of silver]]. The coin is named after its designer, United States Mint Assistant Engraver [[George T. Morgan]]. The [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts a profile portrait representing [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]], while the reverse depicts an eagle with wings outstretched. The mint mark, if present, appears on the reverse above the \"o\" in \"Dollar\".\n\nThe dollar was authorized by the [[Bland\u2013Allison Act]]. Following the passage of the 1873 act, mining interests lobbied to restore free silver, which would require the Mint to accept all silver presented to it and return it, struck into coin. Instead, the Bland\u2013Allison Act was passed, which required the Treasury to purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver at market value to be coined into dollars each month. In 1890, the Bland\u2013Allison Act was repealed by the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], which required the Treasury to purchase {{convert|4500000|ozt|kg}} of silver each month, but only required further silver dollar production for one year. This act, once again, was repealed in 1893.\n\nIn 1898, Congress approved a bill that required all remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act to be coined into silver dollars. When those silver reserves were depleted in 1904, the Mint ceased to strike the Morgan dollar. The [[Pittman Act]], passed in 1918, authorized the melting and recoining of millions of silver dollars. Pursuant to the act, Morgan dollars resumed mintage for one year in 1921. The design was replaced by the [[Peace dollar]] later the same year.\n\nIn the early 1960s, a large quantity of uncirculated Morgan dollars in their original bags were discovered in the Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value and then [[Gresham's law|removed them from circulation through hoarding]], and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the [[Carson City Mint]] through the [[General Services Administration]]. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to [[commemorative coin|commemorate]] the old [[San Francisco Mint]] building.\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Richard P.

Groups were formed that demanded the free coinage of silver (or \"[[free silver]]\") in order to inflate the dollar following the [[Panic of 1873]].{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=24}}\n\nBeginning in 1876, several bills were introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in an effort to resume the free coinage of silver.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=24}} One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative [[Richard P. Bland]] of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=24}} Republican senator [[William B. Allison]] of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=24}} This same amendment allowed for the issuance of [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] for the first time in United States history.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=24}} The bill was [[veto]]ed by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]].<ref name=\"Harness\" /> The president's veto was overridden on February 28, 1878.<ref name=\"Harness\" /> What came to be known as the [[Bland\u2013Allison Act]] required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver per month, to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold/silver value ratio of 16:1, meaning that one ounce of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver.{{sfn|Fite|p=429}}\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== Design history ==\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| image1    = Halfdollarmorgan.JPG\n| width1    = 250\n| alt1      = A pattern coin depicting a left-facing woman on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse\n| caption1  = A pattern half dollar created by George T.

Linderman also ordered Pollock to \"instruct Mr. Barber to prepare a reverse die for a dollar with a representation of an eagle as well as the inscriptions required by law. He will select whichever of his Heads of Liberty he prefers for the obverse of the same.\"{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=79}} Linderman evidently preferred the designs of Morgan over those of the Chief Engraver; he wrote Pollock on February 21, 1878, \"I have now to state for your information, that it is my intention, in the event of the silver bill now pending in Congress, becoming law, to request the approval by the Secretary of the Treasury, of the dies prepared by Mr. Morgan.\"{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=83}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n[[File:Morgan half dollar.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A coin depicting the profile of a young woman|Morgan's design, struck as a half dollar pattern in 1877]]\n[[File:Dollar-morgan.jpg|thumb|1881 Morgan Dollar Reverse]]\n\n[[File:Philadelphia, Mint coining press, from Robert N.

this was done because all prior United States coinage depicted the bald eagle as having an odd number of tail feathers.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=87}} The high relief had caused the dies to have a shorter life.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=88}} Dies were eventually sent to the Western mints, arriving in both San Francisco and Carson City on April 16, 1878.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=90}} The [[New Orleans Mint]] began striking the new silver dollars in 1879.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=219}}\n\nThe [[Denver Mint]], established in 1906, struck the coins for only one year, in 1921.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=221}} The [[mint mark]]s appearing on the coins are none, representing Philadelphia, \"<small>CC</small>\" for Carson City, \"<small>S</small>\" for San Francisco, \"<small>O</small>\" for New Orleans and \"<small>D</small>\" for Denver.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=221}} In order to conform to the Coinage Act of&nbsp;1837, the Morgan dollar contained ninety percent silver and ten percent copper, measured {{convert|38.1|mm|in|}} in diameter and weighed {{convert|412.5|gr|g}}.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=218}}\n\n== Sherman Silver Purchase Act, Panic of 1893 ==\n\n{{main article|Sherman Silver Purchase Act|Panic of 1893}}\n[[File:John-Sherman-2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Ohio senator John Sherman authored the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, forcing the Treasury to purchase {{convert|4500000|ozt|kg}} each month.]]\n\nMintage of the Morgan dollar remained relatively steady until the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act on July 14, 1890.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=220}} The act, authored by Ohio senator and former Treasury secretary John Sherman, forced the Treasury to increase the amount of silver purchased to {{convert|4500000|ozt|kg}} each month.{{sfn|Fite|p=446}} Supporters of the act believed that an increase in the amount of silver purchased would result in inflation, helping to relieve the nation's farmers.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=27}} The act also received support from mining interests because such large purchases would cause the price of silver to rise and increase their profits.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=27}} Despite the Act's requiring large purchases of silver indefinitely, it provided that the Mint must coin 2,000,000 silver dollars each month only until 1891.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=29}} Since the Treasury already had a surplus of silver dollars, minting of dollars dropped sharply beginning in 1892.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=220}} The silver that remained after mintage of the dollars was used to mint dimes, quarters and half dollars.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=220}}\n\nBeginning early in 1893, a number of industrial firms, including the [[Philadelphia and Reading Railroad]] and the [[National Cordage Company]] went bankrupt.<ref name=\"Brothers pp48\u201352\" /> The resulting bank runs and failures became known as the [[Panic of 1893]].<ref name=\"Brothers pp48\u201352\" /> In June of that year, President [[Grover Cleveland]], who believed that the Panic was caused by the inflation generated by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, called a [[special session]] of Congress in order to repeal it.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=29}} The act was repealed on November 1, 1893.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=29}} On June 13, 1898, Congress ordered the coining of all the remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act into silver dollars.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=29}} Silver dollar production rose again,{{sfn|Yeoman|p=221}} until the bullion was exhausted in 1904, when it ceased.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=30}}\n\n== Pittman Act ==\n\n{{main article|Pittman Act}}\n[[File:Key Pittman in 1915.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Senator Key Pittman was responsible for the act that called for the melting of up to 350,000,000 silver dollars.]]\n\nThe German government began a propaganda campaign  during World War I to discredit the United Kingdom's currency in India.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=30}} The Germans convinced Indian citizens that British banknotes in that country could not be redeemed for silver. This led to a run on the British supply of silver.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=30}} In response, United States Democratic senator [[Key Pittman]] of Nevada introduced legislation in 1918 that was intended to offer financial relief to the British government.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=31}} The bill, passed on April 22, 1918, stated that \"sales of silver bullion under authority of this act may be made for the purpose of conserving the existing stock of gold in the United States, of providing silver for subsidiary coinage and for commercial use, and of assisting foreign governments at war with the enemies of the United States\".{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=31}} The [[Pittman Act]] authorized the U.S. to melt up to 350,000,000 silver dollars,{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=31}} and this commenced immediately after the Act's passage.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=31}} The U.S. eventually melted a total of 270,232,722&nbsp;silver dollars.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=31}} Of that amount, 259,121,554&nbsp; were sold to the United Kingdom at the cost of one dollar per troy ounce.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=31}}\n\nThe U.S. only minted the Morgan dollar again during 1921,{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=32}} the only year in which Morgan dollars were struck at the Denver mint. Since the Treasury had destroyed the obsolete Morgan dollar dies in 1910, Morgan had to create an entirely new master die.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=95}}  Another provision of the Pittman Act authorized the U.S. to mint a replacement coin for every silver dollar melted.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=32}} During the same year, the [[Peace dollar]] was first issued to commemorate the end of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Yeoman|p=222}} The Peace dollar was supposedly minted to replace the Morgan dollar under the terms of the Pittman Act but without congressional authorization, despite the fact that the Act did not describe the coin design.{{sfn|Yeoman|p=222}} The change in design was actually authorized under an 1890 act of Congress,{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=409}} which stated:\n{{quote | But no change in the design or die of any coin shall be made oftener than once in twenty-five years from and including the year of the first adoption of the design, model, die, or hub for the same coin:\n\n''Provided'', That no change be made in the diameter of any coin:\n\n''And provided further'', That nothing in this section shall prevent the adoption of new designs or models for devices or emblems already authorized for the standard silver dollar and the five-cent nickel piece as soon as practicable after the passage of this act.<ref name=\"Richardson pp806\u2013807\" />  }}\n\n== Carson City Mint Morgan dollars  ==\nUntil 1964, U.S. citizens could redeem paper money known as [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] for silver dollars at a U.S. Treasury mint on demand. In 1962, an individual redeemed a silver certificate and received a rare and valuable Morgan dollar in exchange.

The [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts a profile portrait representing [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]], while the reverse depicts an eagle with wings outstretched. The mint mark, if present, appears on the reverse above the \"o\" in \"Dollar\".\n\nThe dollar was authorized by the [[Bland\u2013Allison Act]]. Following the passage of the 1873 act, mining interests lobbied to restore free silver, which would require the Mint to accept all silver presented to it and return it, struck into coin. Instead, the Bland\u2013Allison Act was passed, which required the Treasury to purchase between two and four million dollars' worth of silver at market value to be coined into dollars each month. In 1890, the Bland\u2013Allison Act was repealed by the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], which required the Treasury to purchase {{convert|4500000|ozt|kg}} of silver each month, but only required further silver dollar production for one year. This act, once again, was repealed in 1893.\n\nIn 1898, Congress approved a bill that required all remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act to be coined into silver dollars. When those silver reserves were depleted in 1904, the Mint ceased to strike the Morgan dollar. The [[Pittman Act]], passed in 1918, authorized the melting and recoining of millions of silver dollars. Pursuant to the act, Morgan dollars resumed mintage for one year in 1921. The design was replaced by the [[Peace dollar]] later the same year.\n\nIn the early 1960s, a large quantity of uncirculated Morgan dollars in their original bags were discovered in the Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value and then [[Gresham's law|removed them from circulation through hoarding]], and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the [[Carson City Mint]] through the [[General Services Administration]]. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to [[commemorative coin|commemorate]] the old [[San Francisco Mint]] building.\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Richard P.

Groups were formed that demanded the free coinage of silver (or \"[[free silver]]\") in order to inflate the dollar following the [[Panic of 1873]].{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=24}}\n\nBeginning in 1876, several bills were introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in an effort to resume the free coinage of silver.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=24}} One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative [[Richard P. Bland]] of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=24}} Republican senator [[William B. Allison]] of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. The House bill allowed Free Silver; one of Allison's amendments struck that provision.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=24}} This same amendment allowed for the issuance of [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]] for the first time in United States history.{{sfn|Van Allen & Mallis|p=24}} The bill was [[veto]]ed by President [[Rutherford B.

Under this model, a state's government is divided into branches, each with separate, independent powers and responsibilities so that [[power (social and political)|powers]] of one branch are not in conflict with those of the other branches. The typical division is into three branches: a [[legislature]], an [[Executive (government)|executive]], and a [[judiciary]], which is the {{Lang|la|'''trias politica'''}} model. It can be contrasted with the [[fusion of powers]] in [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and [[semi-presidential systems]], where the executive and legislative branches overlap.\n\nSeparation of powers, therefore, refers to the division of responsibilities into distinct '''branches of government''' by limiting any one branch from exercising the core functions of another. The intent of separation of powers is to prevent the concentration of power by providing for '''checks and balances'''.\n\nThe separation of powers model is often imprecisely and [[metonymy|metonymically]] used interchangeably with the ''{{Lang|la|trias politica}}'' principle. While the {{Lang|la|trias politica}} model is a common type of separation, there are governments that have greater or fewer than three branches, as mentioned later in the article.\n\n== History ==\n{{Republicanism sidebar}}\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n[[Aristotle]] first mentioned the idea of a \"mixed government\" or hybrid government in his work [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], where he drew upon many of the constitutional forms in the [[Polis|city-states of Ancient Greece]]. In the [[Roman Republic]], the [[Roman Senate]], [[Roman consul|Consuls]] and the [[Roman assemblies|Assemblies]] showed an example of a [[mixed government]] according to [[Polybius]] (''Histories'', Book 6, 11\u201313).\n\n=== Early modern mixed government ===\n[[John Calvin]] (1509\u20131564) favoured a system of government that divided political power between [[democracy]] and [[aristocracy]] ([[mixed government]]). Calvin appreciated the advantages of [[democracy]], stating: \"It is an invaluable gift if God allows a people to elect its own government and magistrates.\"<ref>Quoted in Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', Third Edition (1960), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210</ref> In order to reduce the danger of misuse of political power, Calvin suggested setting up several political institutions that should complement and control each other in a system of [[checks and balances]].<ref>\n{{cite book |last1 = Ward |first1 = Lee |author-link1 = Lee Ward |title = Modern Democracy and the Theological-Political Problem in Spinoza, Rousseau, and Jefferson |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YuUaBgAAQBAJ | series = Recovering Political Philosophy |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan |publication-date = 2014 |pages = 25\u201326 |isbn = 9781137475053 |accessdate = 2015-11-03 |quote = Calvin's republican sympathies derived from his view of human nature as deeply flawed.

He deduced from a study of the English constitutional system the advantages of dividing political power into the legislative (which should be distributed among several bodies, for example, the [[House of Lords]] and the [[House of Commons]]), on the one hand, and the executive and federative power, responsible for the protection of the country and prerogative of the monarch, on the other hand.

Few years later, one of the first documents proposing a tripartite system of separation of powers was the [[Instrument of Government]], written by the English general [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]] in 1653, and soon adopted as the constitution of England for few years during [[The Protectorate]]. The system comprised a legislative branch (the Parliament) and two executive branches, the [[English Council of State]] and the [[Lord Protector]], all being elected (though the Lord Protector was elected for life) and having checks upon each other.<ref>Vile, M.

This followed the use of the juridical system by the Crown to prosecute opposition leaders following [[The English Restoration|the Restoration]], in the late years of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] and during the short reign of [[James II of England|James II]] (namely, during the 1680-s).<ref> Marshall J.

Montesquieu's approach was to present and defend a form of government whose powers were not excessively centralized in a single monarch or similar ruler (a form known then as \"aristocracy\"). He based this model on the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic]] and the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional system]].

By the second, he makes peace or war, sends or receives embassies, establishes the public security, and provides against invasions.

The idea is that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but the branches need to have the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed48.asp |title = The Avalon Project : Federalist No 48 |website=avalon.law.yale.edu |access-date=2018-03-28 }}</ref> They guarantee that the branches have the same level of power (co-equal), that is, are balanced, so that they can limit each other, avoiding the abuse of power. The origin of checks and balances, like separation of powers itself, is specifically credited to [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] in the Enlightenment (in [[The Spirit of the Laws]], 1748). Under this influence it was implemented in 1787 in the [[Constitution of the United States]].\n\nThe following example of the separation of powers and their mutual checks and balances from the experience of the [[United States Constitution]] is presented as illustrative of the general principles applied in [[presidential system|similar forms of government]] as well:<ref name=\"federalistNo51\">{{cite web |url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed51.asp |title = The Avalon Project : Federalist No 51 |last=James|first=Madison|date=|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\nBut the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.\n\nA dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.

Canada makes limited use of separation of powers in practice, although in theory it distinguishes between branches of government. New Zealand's [[Constitution of New Zealand|constitution]] is based on the principle of separation of powers through a series of constitutional safeguards, many of which are tacit. The Executive's ability to carry out decisions often depends on the Legislature, which is elected under the [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed member proportional]] system. This means the government is rarely a single party but a coalition of parties. The Judiciary is also free of government interference. If a series of judicial decisions result in an interpretation of the law which the Executive considers does not reflect the intention of the policy, the Executive can initiate changes to the legislation in question through the Legislature. The Executive cannot direct or request a judicial officer to revise or reconsider a decision; decisions are final. Should there be a dispute between the Executive and Judiciary, the Executive has no authority to direct the Judiciary, or its individual members and vice versa.\n\nComplete separation of powers systems are almost always [[Presidential system|presidential]], although theoretically this need not be the case. There are a few historical exceptions, such as the [[French Directory|Directoire]] system of revolutionary France. [[Swiss politics|Switzerland]] offers an example of non-Presidential separation of powers today: It is run by a seven-member executive branch, the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]]. However, some might argue{{Weasel inline|date=September 2017}} that Switzerland does not have a strong separation of powers system as the Federal Council is appointed by parliament (but not dependent on parliament) and, although the judiciary has no power of review, the judiciary is still separate from the other branches.\n\n=== Typical branches ===\n* [[Executive (government)|executive]]\n* [[legislature|legislative]]\n* [[judiciary|judicial]]\n\n==== Additional branches ====\n* [[government performance auditing|auditory]]\n* [[election commission|electoral]] \u2013 in which election commissions, tribunals or courts are maintained separately from other branches\n* [[Attorney general|prosecutory]]\n* [[civil service commission]]\n\n=== Three branches ===\n==== Australia ====\n{{Main|Separation of powers in Australia}}\n\n[[Australia]] does not maintain a strict separation between the legislative and executive branches of government\u2014indeed, government ministers are required to be members of parliament\u2014but the federal judiciary strictly guards its independence from the other two branches.

Nor did people really want to get rid of the king and the Council of State (privy council). King and council was a known concept that people had lived with for a long time and for the most part were comfortable with. The 1814 constitution came about as a reaction to external events, most notable the [[Treaty of Kiel]] (see [[1814 in Norway]]). There was no revolution against the current powers, as had been the case in the U.S. and France.\n\nAs there was no election of the executive, the king reigned supremely independent in selecting the members of the Council of State, no formal political parties formed until the 1880s. A conflict between the executive and legislature started developing in the 1870s and climaxed with the legislature impeaching the entire Council of State in 1884 (see [[:no:Statsr\u00e5dssaken|Statsr\u00e5dssaken [Norwegian Wikipedia page]]]). With this came a switch to a [[parliamentary system]] of government. While the full process took decades, it has led to a system of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], where the Montesquieu idea of separation of powers is technically dead even though the three branches remain important institutions.\n\nThis ''does not'' mean that there are no checks and balances. With the introduction of a parliamentary system, political parties started to form quickly, which led to a call for electoral reform that saw the introduction of [[Party-list proportional representation]] in 1918. The peculiarities of the Norwegian election system generate 6\u20138 parties and make it extremely difficult for a single party to gain an absolute majority. It has only occurred for a brief period in the aftermath of World War II where the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] had an absolute majority.\n\nA [[multi-party system]] parliament that must either form a minority executive or a coalition executive functions as a perfectly good system of checks and balances even if it was never a stated goal for the introduction of multiparty system. The multiparty system came about in response to a public outcry of having too few parties and a general feeling of a lack of representation. For this reason, very little on the topic of separation of powers or checks and balances can be found in the works of Norwegian political sciences today.\n\n==== Pakistan ====\n{{Main|Constitution of Pakistan|Government of Pakistan}}\n\n* [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] \u2013 [[Legislative]]\n* [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] and their [[Cabinet of Pakistan|Cabinet]] \u2013 [[Executive (government)|Executive]]\n* [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] and [[Judiciary of Pakistan|lower courts]] \u2013 [[Judicial]]\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n{{Main|Separation of powers in the United Kingdom}}\n\n* Parliament \u2013 legislature\n* Prime Minister, Cabinet, Government Departments and Civil Service \u2013 executive\n* Courts \u2013 judiciary\n\nThe development of the British constitution, which is not a [[Codification (law)|codified]] document, is based on fusion in the person of the Monarch, who has a formal role to play in the legislature (Parliament, which is where legal and political sovereignty lies, is the Crown-in-Parliament, and is summoned and dissolved by the Sovereign who must give his or her Royal Assent to all Bills so that they become Acts), the executive (the Sovereign appoints all ministers of His/Her Majesty's Government, who govern in the name of the Crown) and the judiciary (the Sovereign, as the fount of justice, appoints all senior judges, and all public prosecutions are brought in his or her name).\n\nAlthough the [[doctrine]] of separation of power plays a role in the United Kingdom's constitutional life, the constitution is often described as having \"a weak separation of powers\" ([[A. V. Dicey]]) despite it being the one to which Montesquieu originally referred. For example, the executive forms a subset of the legislature, as did\u2014to a lesser extent\u2014the judiciary until the establishment of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]. The Prime Minister, the Chief Executive, sits as a member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], either as a peer in the [[House of Lords]] or as an elected member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] (by convention, and as a result of the supremacy of the Lower House, the Prime Minister now sits in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]). Furthermore, while the courts in the United Kingdom are amongst the most independent in the world,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} the [[Law Lords]], who were the final arbiters of most judicial disputes in the U.K. sat simultaneously in the [[House of Lords]], the upper house of the legislature, although this arrangement ceased in 2009 when the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] came into existence. Furthermore, because of the existence of Parliamentary sovereignty, while the theory of separation of powers may be studied there, a system such as that of the U.K. is more accurately described as a \"[[fusion of powers]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nUntil 2005, the [[Lord Chancellor]] fused in his person the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, as he was the ex officio [[Lord Speaker|Speaker of the House of Lords]], a Government Minister who sat in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] and was head of the [[Lord Chancellor's Department]], which administered the courts, the justice system and appointed judges, and was the head of the Judiciary in England and Wales and sat as a judge on the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords]], the highest domestic court in the entire United Kingdom, and the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], the senior tribunal court for parts of the Commonwealth. The [[Lord Chancellor]] also had certain other judicial positions, including being a judge in the Court of Appeal and President of the Chancery Division. The [[Lord Chancellor]] combines other aspects of the constitution, including having certain ecclesiastical functions of the [[Church of England|established state church]], making certain church appointments, nominations and sitting as one of the thirty-three Church Commissioners. These functions remain intact and unaffected by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005|Constitutional Reform Act]]. In 2005, the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005|Constitutional Reform Act]] separated the powers with Legislative functions going to an elected [[Lord Speaker]] and the Judicial functions going to the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]]. The [[Lord Chancellor's Department]] was replaced with a [[Ministry of Justice]] and the [[Lord Chancellor]] currently serves in the position of [[Secretary of State for Justice]].\n\nThe judiciary has no power to strike down primary legislation, and can only rule on secondary legislation that it is invalid with regard to the primary legislation if necessary.\n\nUnder the concept of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], [[Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons|Parliament]] can enact any primary legislation it chooses. However, the concept immediately becomes problematic when the question is asked, \"If parliament can do anything, can it bind its successors?\" It is generally held that parliament can do no such thing.\n\nEqually, while statute takes precedence over precedent-derived common law and the judiciary has no power to strike down primary legislation, there are certain cases where the supreme judicature has effected an injunction against the application of an act or reliance on its authority by the civil service. The seminal example of this is the [[Factortame litigation|Factortame case]], where the House of Lords granted such an injunction preventing the operation of the ''Merchant Shipping Act 1988'' until litigation in the European Court of Justice had been resolved.\n\nThe House of Lords ruling in Factortame (No. 1), approving the European Court of Justice formulation that \"a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule\", has created an implicit tiering of legislative reviewability; the only way for parliament to prevent the supreme judicature from injunctively striking out a law on the basis of incompatibility with Community law is to pass an act specifically removing that power from the court, or by repealing the ''European Communities Act 1972''.\n\nThe British legal systems are based on [[common law]] traditions, which require:\n* [[Police]] or [[Regulatory agency|regulators]] cannot initiate complaints under [[criminal law]] but can only investigate (prosecution is mostly reserved for the [[Crown Prosecution Service]]), which prevents [[selective enforcement]]\u2014e.g., the \"[[fishing expedition]],\" which is often specifically forbidden.\n* [[Prosecutor]]s cannot withhold evidence from [[Lawyer|counsel]] for the [[defendant]]; to do so results in [[Mistrials|mistrial]] or dismissal. Accordingly, their relation to police is no advantage.\n* [[Defendant]]s convicted can [[appeal (law)|appeal]], but only fresh and compelling evidence not available at trial can be introduced, restricting the power of the [[court of appeal]] to the process of law applied.\n\n==== United States ====\n{{Main|Separation of powers under the United States Constitution}}\n[[File:Washington Constitutional Convention 1787.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[George Washington]] at [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, signing of U.S. Constitution]]\n[[File:Justice Antonin Scalia on Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances.webm|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] about separation of powers and checks and balances of the U.S. Government]]\n\nSeparation of powers was first established in the [[United States Constitution]], wherein the founding fathers included features of many new concepts, including hard-learned historical lessons about the checks and balances of power. Similar concepts were also prominent in the state governments of the United States. As colonies of Great Britain, the founding fathers considered that the American states had suffered an abuse of the broad power of parliamentarism and monarchy. As a remedy, the United States Constitution limits the powers of the federal government through various means\u2014in particular, the three branches of the federal government are divided by exercising different functions. The executive and legislative powers are separated in origin by separate elections, and the judiciary is kept independent. Each branch controls the actions of others and balances its powers in some way.\n\nIn the Constitution, Article 1 Section I grants Congress only those \"legislative powers herein granted\" and proceeds to list those permissible actions in Article I Section 8, while Section 9 lists actions that are prohibited for Congress. The vesting clause in Article II places no limits on the Executive branch, simply stating that \"The Executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html |title=Constitution of the United States |publisher=Archives.gov |date=2000-09-15 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> The Supreme Court holds \"The judicial Power\" according to Article III, and [[judicial review]] was established in ''[[Marbury v.

The people appoint their representatives to meet periodically in a legislative body, and, since they do not have a king, the people themselves elect a preeminent citizen to perform, also periodically, the executive functions of the State. \n\nThe direct election of the head of state or of the executive power is an inevitable consequence of the political freedom of the people, understood as the capacity to appoint and depose their leaders. Only this separate election of the person who has to fulfill the functions that the Constitution attributes to the president, so different by its nature and by its function from the election of representatives of the electors, allows the executive power to be controlled by the legislative and submitted to the demands of political responsibility.<ref>{{Cite book|author-link=Antonio Garcia-Trevijano|title=A Pure Theory of Democracy|last=Garcia-Trevijano|first=Antonio|date=2009-09-30|publisher=[[University Press of America]]|isbn=9780761848561|location=Lanham, Md|language=English|translator-last=Pe\u00f1aranda|translator-first=Miguel Rodr\u00edguez de}}</ref>{{Disputed inline||date=January 2020}}\n\n[[Judicial independence]] is maintained by appointments for life, which remove any dependence on the Executive, with voluntary retirement and a high threshold for dismissal by the Legislature, in addition to a salary that cannot be diminished during their service.\n\nThe [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] refers to the branches as \"branches of government\", while some systems use \"government\" exclusively to describe the executive.

Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would require that all the appointments for the supreme executive, legislative, and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the same fountain of authority, the people, through channels having no communication whatever with one another. Perhaps such a plan of constructing the several departments would be less difficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some difficulties, however, and some additional expense would attend the execution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from the principle must be admitted. In the constitution of the judiciary department in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist rigorously on the principle: first, because peculiar qualifications being essential in the members, the primary consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which best secures these qualifications; secondly, because the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that department, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the authority conferring them.\n\nIt is equally evident, that the members of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices. Were the executive magistrate, or the judges, not independent of the legislature in this particular, their independence in every other would be merely nominal.\n|3=}}\n\n=== Other systems ===\n==== China ====\n===== Imperial China =====\n{{Main|Political systems of Imperial China}}\n\n; [[Three Lords and Nine Ministers]] (ancient)\n[[Three Ducal Ministers|Three Lords]]:\n# [[Grand chancellor (China)|Chancellor]] \u2013 executive leader\n# [[Yushi Dafu|Grandee Secretary]] ([[Censorate]] chief and also Deputy Chancellor) \u2013 supervisory leader\n# [[Grand Commandant]] \u2013 military leader\n[[Nine Ministers]] / [[Nine Courts]], etc.\n\n; [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]] (medieval)\n# [[Department of State Affairs]] \u2013 edict execution\n## [[Ministry of Personnel]]\n## [[Ministry of Revenue (imperial China)|Ministry of Revenue]]\n## [[Ministry of Rites]]\n## [[Ministry of War (imperial China)|Ministry of War]]\n## [[Ministry of Justice (imperial China)|Ministry of Justice]]\n## [[Ministry of Works (imperial China)|Ministry of Works]]\n# [[Zhongshu Sheng|Secretariat]] \u2013 edict formulation\n# [[Menxia Sheng|Chancellery]] \u2013 edict review\n* [[Censorate]] \u2013 supervision\n* [[Nine Courts]], [[Five Directorates]], etc.\n\n; [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties\n* [[Emperor of China|Emperor]], via [[Grand Council (Qing dynasty)|Grand Council]] or equivalent\n** [[Grand Secretariat]] (cabinet) \u2013 edict formulation\n** [[Three Departments and Six Ministries|Six Ministries]] \u2013 edict execution\n** [[Censorate]] \u2013 supervision\n*** Reviewers of the {{ill|Six Offices of Scrutiny|zh|\u516d\u79d1}} \u2013 supervising the Six Ministries\n*** 13~20 Circuits [[investigating censor]]s \u2013supervising regional officials\n** [[Nine Courts|Five Courts]], etc.\n\n; Judicial\n{{ill|Three Judicial Offices|zh|\u4e09\u6cd5\u53f8}}:\n# [[Ministry of Justice (imperial China)|Ministry of Justice]] \u2013 case judgement\n# [[Censorate]] \u2013 case supervision\n# [[Court of Judicature and Revision]] \u2013 case review\n\n; Military\n* [[Emperor of China|Emperor]]\n** [[Bureau of Military Affairs|Privy Council]] or equivalent\n** [[Ministry of War (imperial China)|Ministry of War]]\n** Commands (e.g., Three Commands of the [[Northern Song Dynasty|Northern Song]] [[royal guard]] forces, and {{ill|Five-Army Commands|zh|\u4e94\u519b\u90fd\u7763\u5e9c}} of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] armies)\n\n===== Republic of China =====\n{{Main|Government of the Republic of China}}\n\nAccording to [[Sun Yat-sen]]'s idea of \"[[Five-Power Constitution|separation of the five powers]]\", the government of the Republic of China has five branches:\n* [[Executive Yuan]] \u2013 led by the [[Premier of the Republic of China|premier]] but in actuality it is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]] who sets policy \u2013 executive\n* [[Legislative Yuan]] \u2013 [[unicameral]] \u2013 legislature\n* [[Judicial Yuan]] \u2013 its Constitutional Court (highest) and [[Supreme Court of the Republic of China|Supreme Court]] have different jurisdictions \u2013 judiciary\n* [[Control Yuan]] \u2013 audit branch\n* [[Examination Yuan]] \u2013 civil service personnel management and human resources\n\nThe [[President of the Republic of China|president]] and [[Vice President of the Republic of China|vice president]] as well as the defunct [[National Assembly of the Republic of China|National Assembly]] are constitutionally not part of the above five branches. Before being abolished in 2005, the National Assembly was a standing [[constituent assembly]] and [[electoral college]] for the president and vice president. Its constitutional amending powers were passed to the legislative yuan and its electoral powers were passed to the electorate.\n\nThe relationship between the executive and legislative branches are poorly defined. An example of the problems this causes is the near complete political paralysis that results when the president, who has neither the power to veto nor the ability to dissolve the legislature and call new elections, cannot negotiate with the legislature when his party is in the minority.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.fpri.org/enotes/asia.20020418.rigger.taiwanpoliticalparalysis.html |title = E-Notes: Why Taiwan's Political Paralysis PersistsFPRI |publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute |date=18 April 2002 |author=Shelley Rigger |access-date=2008-10-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050210073526/http://www.fpri.org/enotes/asia.20020418.rigger.taiwanpoliticalparalysis.html |archive-date = 10 February 2005 }}</ref> The examination and control yuans are marginal branches; their leaders as well as the leaders of the executive and judicial yuans are appointed by the president and confirmed by the legislative yuan.

The constitution of 1831, considered one of the most liberal of its time for limiting the powers of its monarch and imposing a rigorous system of separation of powers, is based on three principles (represented in the [[Schematic overview of Belgian institutions]]).\n\n''{{Lang|la|Trias politica}}'' (horizontal separation of powers):\n\n* The legislative power is attributed to a parliamentary body elected with through a representative general election system (one person, one vote).\n* The executive power is attributed to the Council of Ministers. Ministers are formally appointed by the King though in practice the [[prime minister]] decides the composition of his cabinet. The ministers are usually from the elected members of parliament (although non-elected people can also be nominated); however, they must first resign from their elected seat.\n* The judicial power is in the hands of the courts. Magistrates are nominated by the minister on proposal from a Council of the Magistrates.\n** Magistrates can be nominated to become a judge (sitting magistrates) or instructing judge (investigating judge) of Procureur (public prosecutor) (the standing magistrates).\n** The executive branch of the government is responsible for providing the physical means to execute its role (infrastructure, staff, financial means).\n** Judges and some other people cannot run for elected office while they are nominated to certain positions (military, police-officers, clergy, notaries, bailiffs).\n\n[[Subsidiarity]] (vertical separation of powers):\n* Supranational directives (EU legislation) and international treaties are subjected to approval of the federal level (the federal level being Belgium the nation state)\n* The federal level comprises the following:\n** A bicameral parliament (House of Representatives and Senate) (in 2014 this will be a directly elected house and an indirectly appointed Senate of the regions)\n** A federal government (led by the Prime Minister, ministers and secretaries of state)\n*** Tasked with overseeing justice, defence, foreign affairs, social security, and public health\n** High Court, Constitutional Court, Cassation Court and Council of State\n* The regional level comprises the following:\n** A unicameral parliament\n** A regional government led by the minister-president (ministers and secretaries of state) is tasked with regional matters\n* Provinces also have similar structures:\n** A unicameral provincial council\n** A nominated provincial governor assisted by deputies is tasked with provincial matters\n** Appellate Court, Assizes Court\n* An intermediate level of Arrondissements subdivides the provinces\n** it has only an executive level with arrondissemental commissars\n* City and communal entities (local government):\n** A city or communal council\n** A mayor, assisted by aldermen, is tasked with local matters\n** Magistrates Court, Correctional Court (three judges)\n** Justice of the peace and Police Court judges (single judge courts)\n\nSecularism (separation of state and religion):\n* The king, the head of state, holds no political authority and requires executive approval by a minister for every action and statement; he nominates the ministers but he does not choose them (his executive powers); he signs and decrees the laws voted in parliament (his legislative powers);\n* The head of state is commander in chief of the military (in title only), politically the military depends on the Minister of Defence and the chiefs of staff are responsible towards parliament and take their orders from the Minister of Defence and the government;\n* Certain functions are deemed incompatible and people must resign from their function if they want to assume responsibilities in another function (military commanders have never been government ministers, even during a war).\n\n==== Costa Rica ====\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Costa Rican Civil War|43-day civil war]] in 1948 (after former [[President of Costa Rica|President]] and incumbent candidate [[Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia]] tried to take power through [[Voter fraud|fraud]], by not recognising the results of the [[1948 Costa Rican general election|presidential election]] that he had lost), the question of which transformational model the Costa Rican State would follow was the main issue that confronted the victors. A [[Constituent Assembly of Costa Rica|Constituent Assembly]] was elected by popular vote to draw up a new constitution, [[Costa Rican Constitution|enacted in 1949]], and remains in force. This document was an edit of the [[Costa Rican Constitution of 1871|constitution of 1871]], as the constituent assembly rejected more radical corporatist ideas proposed by the ruling [[Junta Fundadora de la Segunda Rep\u00fablica]] (which, although having come to power by military force, abolished the armed forces). Nonetheless, the new constitution increased centralization of power at the expense of municipalities and eliminated provincial government altogether, and at the time it increased the powers of congress and the judiciary.\n\nIt established the three supreme powers as the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, but also created two other autonomous state organs that have equivalent power, but not equivalent rank. The first is the [[Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones de Costa Rica]] (electoral branch), which controls elections and makes unique, unappealable decisions on their outcomes.\n\nThe second is the office of the [[Comptroller|Comptroller General]] (audit branch), an autonomous and independent organ nominally subordinate to the unicameral legislative assembly. All budgets of ministries and municipalities must pass through this agency, including the execution of budget items such as contracting for routine operations. The Comptroller also provides financial vigilance over government offices and office holders, and routinely brings actions to remove mayors for malfeasance, firmly establishing this organization as the fifth branch of the Republic.\n\n==== European Union ====\n\nThe [[European Union]] is a supranational polity, and is neither a country nor a federation; but as the EU wields political power it complies with the principle of separation of powers. There are seven [[institutions of the European Union]]. In intergovernmental matters, most power is concentrated in the [[Council of the European Union]]\u2014giving it the characteristics of a normal [[international organization]]. Here, all power at the EU level is in one branch. In the latter there are four main actors. The [[European Commission]] acts as an independent executive which is appointed by the Council in conjunction with the European Parliament; but the Commission also has a legislative role as the sole initiator of EU legislation.<ref>Bomberg, Elizabeth, Peterson, John, and [[Richard Corbett]], eds.

As well as both executive and legislative functions, the Commission arguably exercises a third, quasi-judicial, function under Articles 101 & 102 TFEU (competition law ); although the ECJ remains the final arbiter. The [[European Parliament]] is one half of the legislative branch and is directly elected. The Council itself acts both as the second half of the legislative branch and also holds some executive functions (some of which are exercised by the related [[European Council]] in practice). The [[European Court of Justice]] acts as the independent judicial branch, interpreting EU law and treaties. The remaining institution, the [[European Court of Auditors]], is an independent audit authority (due to the sensitive nature of fraud in the EU).\n* [[Council of the European Union]] \u2013 executive and legislative\n* [[European Commission]] \u2013 executive, legislative and quasi-judicial\n* [[European Council]] \u2013 executive\n* [[European Court of Auditors]] \u2013 audit\n* [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] and the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] \u2013 judicial\n* [[European Parliament]] \u2013 legislative\n\n==== Germany ====\nThe three branches in German government are further divided into six main bodies enshrined in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]:\n* Federal President (''[[President of Germany|Bundespr\u00e4sident]]'') \u2013 formally executive, but mainly ''representative'' in daily politics\n* Federal Cabinet (''[[Bundesregierung]]'') \u2013 executive\n* Federal Diet (''[[Bundestag]]'') & Federal Council (''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'') \u2013 bicameral legislative\n* Federal Assembly (''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'') \u2013 presidential electoral college (consisting of the members of the Bundestag and electors from the [[States of Germany|constituent states]])\n* Federal Constitutional Court (''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'') \u2013 judiciary\n\nBesides the constitutional court, the judicial branch at the federal level is made up of five supreme courts\u2014one for civil and criminal cases (''Bundesgerichtshof''), and one each for administrative, tax, labour, and social security issues. There are also state-based (''[[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder / Bundesl\u00e4nder]]'') courts beneath them, and a rarely used [[Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts of Germany|senate of the supreme courts]].\n\n==== Hungary ====\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=August 2014}}\nThe four independent branches of power in Hungary (the parliament, the government, the court system, and the office of the public accuser) are divided into six bodies:\n* [[National Assembly (Hungary)|Parliament]] (Magyar Orsz\u00e1ggy\u0171l\u00e9s): elected every 4 years by the people in a highly complex, one-round voting system\n* [[Government of Hungary|Government]] (Magyar Korm\u00e1ny): installed and removed by simple majority vote of the parliament, 4-year terms\n* [[Supreme Court of Hungary|Supreme Court]] (Legfels\u0151bb B\u00edr\u00f3s\u00e1g): Chief justice elected by qualified (2/3) majority of the parliament, no government oversight\n* [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional court]] (Alkotm\u00e1nyb\u00edr\u00f3s\u00e1g): members elected by qualified majority of the parliament for 8 years, this body nullifies laws and has no government oversight\n* [[Chief Prosecutor of Hungary|Chief public accuser]] (Legf\u0151bb \u00fcgy\u00e9sz): elected by qualified majority of the parliament, 6-year terms, office budget fixed, no government oversight\n* [[List of heads of state of Hungary|The President of the Republic]] (K\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1gi Eln\u00f6k) is elected by qualified majority of the Hungarian parliament for 5-year terms (cannot be reelected more than once). The President's task is to oversee the functioning of the democracy. Most of his/her powers are ceremonial only: like signing laws into power and commanding the military in time of peace. But before signing, he/she can also return accepted bills once with advices to the Parliament for reconsideration; he/she can also request nullification in advance from the Constitutional Court. He can negotiate with civil/professional unions regarding the bills. Without the President's permission, the country can neither declare war nor deploy the armed forces.\n\nThe independent pillar status of the Hungarian public accuser's office is a unique construction, loosely modelled on the system Portugal introduced after the 1974 victory of the [[Carnation Revolution]]. The public accuser (attorney general) body has become the fourth column of Hungarian democracy only in recent times: after communism fell in 1989, the office was made independent by a new clause (XI) of the Constitution. The change was meant to prevent abuse of state power, especially with regards to the use of false accusations against opposition politicians, who may be excluded from elections if locked in protracted or excessively severe court cases.\n\nTo prevent the Hungarian accuser's office from neglecting its duties, natural human private persons can submit investigation requests, called \"p\u00f3tmag\u00e1nv\u00e1d,\" directly to the courts if the accusers' office refuses to. Courts will decide if the allegations have merit and order police to act in lieu of the accuser's office if warranted. In its decision No. 42/2005, the Hungarian constitutional court declared that the government does not enjoy such privilege and the state is powerless to further pursue cases if the public accuser refuses to do so.\n\n==== Historical ====\nNotable examples of states after Montesquieu that had more than three powers include:\n{{Expand list|date=November 2018}}\n* Quadripartite Systems:\n** The [[Empire of Brazil]] (1822&ndash;1889) had, in addition to the three traditional powers, the '''moderating power''', which was exercised solely by the Emperor,<ref>https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=fac_articles</ref> and whose function was resolving conflicts between the other powers.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Arm's length principle]]\n* [[Constitutional economics]]\n* [[Constitutionalism]]\n* [[Corruption Perceptions Index]]\n* [[Fourth Estate]]\n* [[Fifth power]]\n* [[Fusion of powers]]\n* [[Judicial activism]]\n* [[Judicial independence]]\n* [[Legal reform]]\n* [[Philosophy of law]]\n* [[Pith and substance]]\n* [[Consociationalism|Power sharing]]\n* [[Reserve power]]\n* [[Rule of Law]]\n* [[Rule according to higher law]]\n* [[Separation of church and state]]\n* [[Separation of duties]]\n* [[Signing statement]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Peter Barenboim, ''[http://www.florentine-society.ru/pdf/Biblical_Roots_of_Separation_of_Powers.pdf Biblical Roots of Separation of Powers]'', Moscow, Letny Sad, 2005. {{ISBN|5-94381-123-0}}, Permalink: http://lccn.loc.gov/2006400578\n* Biancamaria Fontana (ed.), ''[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521033764 The Invention of the Modern Republic]'' (2007) {{ISBN|978-0-521-03376-3}}\n* W.

Under this model, a state's government is divided into branches, each with separate, independent powers and responsibilities so that [[power (social and political)|powers]] of one branch are not in conflict with those of the other branches. The typical division is into three branches: a [[legislature]], an [[Executive (government)|executive]], and a [[judiciary]], which is the {{Lang|la|'''trias politica'''}} model. It can be contrasted with the [[fusion of powers]] in [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and [[semi-presidential systems]], where the executive and legislative branches overlap.\n\nSeparation of powers, therefore, refers to the division of responsibilities into distinct '''branches of government''' by limiting any one branch from exercising the core functions of another. The intent of separation of powers is to prevent the concentration of power by providing for '''checks and balances'''.\n\nThe separation of powers model is often imprecisely and [[metonymy|metonymically]] used interchangeably with the ''{{Lang|la|trias politica}}'' principle. While the {{Lang|la|trias politica}} model is a common type of separation, there are governments that have greater or fewer than three branches, as mentioned later in the article.\n\n== History ==\n{{Republicanism sidebar}}\n\n=== Antiquity ===\n[[Aristotle]] first mentioned the idea of a \"mixed government\" or hybrid government in his work [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], where he drew upon many of the constitutional forms in the [[Polis|city-states of Ancient Greece]].

Calvin appreciated the advantages of [[democracy]], stating: \"It is an invaluable gift if God allows a people to elect its own government and magistrates.\"<ref>Quoted in Jan Weerda, ''Calvin'', in ''Evangelisches Soziallexikon'', Third Edition (1960), Stuttgart (Germany), col. 210</ref> In order to reduce the danger of misuse of political power, Calvin suggested setting up several political institutions that should complement and control each other in a system of [[checks and balances]].<ref>\n{{cite book |last1 = Ward |first1 = Lee |author-link1 = Lee Ward |title = Modern Democracy and the Theological-Political Problem in Spinoza, Rousseau, and Jefferson |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=YuUaBgAAQBAJ | series = Recovering Political Philosophy |publisher = Palgrave Macmillan |publication-date = 2014 |pages = 25\u201326 |isbn = 9781137475053 |accessdate = 2015-11-03 |quote = Calvin's republican sympathies derived from his view of human nature as deeply flawed.

Few years later, one of the first documents proposing a tripartite system of separation of powers was the [[Instrument of Government]], written by the English general [[John Lambert (general)|John Lambert]] in 1653, and soon adopted as the constitution of England for few years during [[The Protectorate]]. The system comprised a legislative branch (the Parliament) and two executive branches, the [[English Council of State]] and the [[Lord Protector]], all being elected (though the Lord Protector was elected for life) and having checks upon each other.<ref>Vile, M.

Montesquieu's approach was to present and defend a form of government whose powers were not excessively centralized in a single monarch or similar ruler (a form known then as \"aristocracy\"). He based this model on the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic]] and the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British constitutional system]].

By the second, he makes peace or war, sends or receives embassies, establishes the public security, and provides against invasions.

If the legislative branch appoints the executive and judicial powers, as Montesquieu indicated, there will be no separation or division of its powers, since the power to appoint carries with it the power to revoke.<ref>Montesquieu, ''The Spirit of Laws'', at p. 156.</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\nThe executive power ought to be in the hands of a monarch, because this branch of government, having need of despatch, is better administered by one than by many: on the other hand, whatever depends on the legislative power is oftentimes better regulated by many than by a single person.\n\nBut if there were no monarch, and the executive power should be committed to a certain number of persons selected from the legislative body, there would be an end then of liberty; by reason the two powers would be united, as the same persons would sometimes possess, and would be always able to possess, a share in both.\n\n||source=}}\n\nMontesquieu actually specified that the independence of the judiciary has to be real, and not merely apparent.<ref name=\"Przeworski 26\">Stephen Holmes, \u201cLineages of the Rule of Law,\u201d in Adam Przeworski & Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Maravall, eds., ''Democracy & the Rule of Law'', Cambridge Studies in the Theory of Democracy Series, \u2116 5 (Cambridge University Press, 2003), pp. 19\u201361 at 26, {{ISBN|0-521-53266-3|}}.</ref> The judiciary was generally seen as the most important of the three powers, independent and unchecked.<ref name=\"Przeworski 13\">Przeworski 2003, p.13</ref>\n\n=== Checks and balances ===\n{{redirect|Checks and balances|the organization|Checks and Balances (organization)}}\n{{See also|Divide and rule}}\n\nThe principle of checks and balances is that each branch has power to limit or check the other two, which creates a balance between the three separate branches of the state. This principle induces one branch to prevent either of the other branches becoming supreme, thus be eternally confronting each other and in that process securing [[political liberty]].\n\n[[Immanuel Kant]] was an advocate of this, noting that \"the problem of setting up a state can be solved even by a nation of devils\" so long as they possess an appropriate constitution to pit opposing factions against each other.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|editor-last=Reiss|editor-first=Hans|title=Political Writings|chapter=Perpetual Peace|location=Cambridge, England |publisher=Cambridge U.P. |year = 1971 |pages=112\u201313 |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=v7v3CwAAQBAJ&pg=PT79&lpg=PT79&dq=%22the+problem+of+setting+up+a+state+can+be+solved+even+by+a+nation+of+devils%22&source=bl&ots=D7n6bl_eln&sig=ACfU3U0RbgJrfdftxb6-FTwpXXBVAeMIxw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjnwJOu_LbgAhUo7IMKHYiJCYYQ6AEwBXoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22the%20problem%20of%20setting%20up%20a%20state%20can%20be%20solved%20even%20by%20a%20nation%20of%20devils%22&f=false }}</ref>\n\nChecks and balances are designed to maintain the system of separation of powers keeping each branch in its place.  The idea is that it is not enough to separate the powers and guarantee their independence but the branches need to have the constitutional means to defend their own legitimate powers from the encroachments of the other branches.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed48.asp |title = The Avalon Project : Federalist No 48 |website=avalon.law.yale.edu |access-date=2018-03-28 }}</ref> They guarantee that the branches have the same level of power (co-equal), that is, are balanced, so that they can limit each other, avoiding the abuse of power. The origin of checks and balances, like separation of powers itself, is specifically credited to [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] in the Enlightenment (in [[The Spirit of the Laws]], 1748). Under this influence it was implemented in 1787 in the [[Constitution of the United States]].\n\nThe following example of the separation of powers and their mutual checks and balances from the experience of the [[United States Constitution]] is presented as illustrative of the general principles applied in [[presidential system|similar forms of government]] as well:<ref name=\"federalistNo51\">{{cite web |url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed51.asp |title = The Avalon Project : Federalist No 51 |last=James|first=Madison|date=|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|\nBut the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same department, consists in giving to those who administer each department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others. The provision for defense must in this, as in all other cases, be made commensurate to the danger of attack. Ambition must be made to counteract ambition. The interest of the man must be connected with the constitutional rights of the place. It may be a reflection on human nature, that such devices should be necessary to control the abuses of government. But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.\n\nA dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions. This policy of supplying, by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, private as well as public. We see it particularly displayed in all the subordinate distributions of power, where the constant aim is to divide and arrange the several offices in such a manner as that each may be a check on the other that the private interest of every individual may be a sentinel over the public rights.

Canada makes limited use of separation of powers in practice, although in theory it distinguishes between branches of government. New Zealand's [[Constitution of New Zealand|constitution]] is based on the principle of separation of powers through a series of constitutional safeguards, many of which are tacit. The Executive's ability to carry out decisions often depends on the Legislature, which is elected under the [[mixed-member proportional representation|mixed member proportional]] system. This means the government is rarely a single party but a coalition of parties. The Judiciary is also free of government interference. If a series of judicial decisions result in an interpretation of the law which the Executive considers does not reflect the intention of the policy, the Executive can initiate changes to the legislation in question through the Legislature. The Executive cannot direct or request a judicial officer to revise or reconsider a decision; decisions are final. Should there be a dispute between the Executive and Judiciary, the Executive has no authority to direct the Judiciary, or its individual members and vice versa.\n\nComplete separation of powers systems are almost always [[Presidential system|presidential]], although theoretically this need not be the case. There are a few historical exceptions, such as the [[French Directory|Directoire]] system of revolutionary France. [[Swiss politics|Switzerland]] offers an example of non-Presidential separation of powers today: It is run by a seven-member executive branch, the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]]. However, some might argue{{Weasel inline|date=September 2017}} that Switzerland does not have a strong separation of powers system as the Federal Council is appointed by parliament (but not dependent on parliament) and, although the judiciary has no power of review, the judiciary is still separate from the other branches.\n\n=== Typical branches ===\n* [[Executive (government)|executive]]\n* [[legislature|legislative]]\n* [[judiciary|judicial]]\n\n==== Additional branches ====\n* [[government performance auditing|auditory]]\n* [[election commission|electoral]] \u2013 in which election commissions, tribunals or courts are maintained separately from other branches\n* [[Attorney general|prosecutory]]\n* [[civil service commission]]\n\n=== Three branches ===\n==== Australia ====\n{{Main|Separation of powers in Australia}}\n\n[[Australia]] does not maintain a strict separation between the legislative and executive branches of government\u2014indeed, government ministers are required to be members of parliament\u2014but the federal judiciary strictly guards its independence from the other two branches.

Nor did people really want to get rid of the king and the Council of State (privy council). King and council was a known concept that people had lived with for a long time and for the most part were comfortable with. The 1814 constitution came about as a reaction to external events, most notable the [[Treaty of Kiel]] (see [[1814 in Norway]]). There was no revolution against the current powers, as had been the case in the U.S. and France.\n\nAs there was no election of the executive, the king reigned supremely independent in selecting the members of the Council of State, no formal political parties formed until the 1880s. A conflict between the executive and legislature started developing in the 1870s and climaxed with the legislature impeaching the entire Council of State in 1884 (see [[:no:Statsr\u00e5dssaken|Statsr\u00e5dssaken [Norwegian Wikipedia page]]]). With this came a switch to a [[parliamentary system]] of government. While the full process took decades, it has led to a system of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], where the Montesquieu idea of separation of powers is technically dead even though the three branches remain important institutions.\n\nThis ''does not'' mean that there are no checks and balances. With the introduction of a parliamentary system, political parties started to form quickly, which led to a call for electoral reform that saw the introduction of [[Party-list proportional representation]] in 1918. The peculiarities of the Norwegian election system generate 6\u20138 parties and make it extremely difficult for a single party to gain an absolute majority. It has only occurred for a brief period in the aftermath of World War II where the [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]] had an absolute majority.\n\nA [[multi-party system]] parliament that must either form a minority executive or a coalition executive functions as a perfectly good system of checks and balances even if it was never a stated goal for the introduction of multiparty system. The multiparty system came about in response to a public outcry of having too few parties and a general feeling of a lack of representation. For this reason, very little on the topic of separation of powers or checks and balances can be found in the works of Norwegian political sciences today.\n\n==== Pakistan ====\n{{Main|Constitution of Pakistan|Government of Pakistan}}\n\n* [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]] \u2013 [[Legislative]]\n* [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] and their [[Cabinet of Pakistan|Cabinet]] \u2013 [[Executive (government)|Executive]]\n* [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] and [[Judiciary of Pakistan|lower courts]] \u2013 [[Judicial]]\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\n{{Main|Separation of powers in the United Kingdom}}\n\n* Parliament \u2013 legislature\n* Prime Minister, Cabinet, Government Departments and Civil Service \u2013 executive\n* Courts \u2013 judiciary\n\nThe development of the British constitution, which is not a [[Codification (law)|codified]] document, is based on fusion in the person of the Monarch, who has a formal role to play in the legislature (Parliament, which is where legal and political sovereignty lies, is the Crown-in-Parliament, and is summoned and dissolved by the Sovereign who must give his or her Royal Assent to all Bills so that they become Acts), the executive (the Sovereign appoints all ministers of His/Her Majesty's Government, who govern in the name of the Crown) and the judiciary (the Sovereign, as the fount of justice, appoints all senior judges, and all public prosecutions are brought in his or her name).\n\nAlthough the [[doctrine]] of separation of power plays a role in the United Kingdom's constitutional life, the constitution is often described as having \"a weak separation of powers\" ([[A. V. Dicey]]) despite it being the one to which Montesquieu originally referred. For example, the executive forms a subset of the legislature, as did\u2014to a lesser extent\u2014the judiciary until the establishment of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]]. The Prime Minister, the Chief Executive, sits as a member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], either as a peer in the [[House of Lords]] or as an elected member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] (by convention, and as a result of the supremacy of the Lower House, the Prime Minister now sits in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]). Furthermore, while the courts in the United Kingdom are amongst the most independent in the world,{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} the [[Law Lords]], who were the final arbiters of most judicial disputes in the U.K. sat simultaneously in the [[House of Lords]], the upper house of the legislature, although this arrangement ceased in 2009 when the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] came into existence. Furthermore, because of the existence of Parliamentary sovereignty, while the theory of separation of powers may be studied there, a system such as that of the U.K. is more accurately described as a \"[[fusion of powers]]\".{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nUntil 2005, the [[Lord Chancellor]] fused in his person the Legislature, Executive and Judiciary, as he was the ex officio [[Lord Speaker|Speaker of the House of Lords]], a Government Minister who sat in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] and was head of the [[Lord Chancellor's Department]], which administered the courts, the justice system and appointed judges, and was the head of the Judiciary in England and Wales and sat as a judge on the [[Judicial Committee of the House of Lords]], the highest domestic court in the entire United Kingdom, and the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], the senior tribunal court for parts of the Commonwealth. The [[Lord Chancellor]] also had certain other judicial positions, including being a judge in the Court of Appeal and President of the Chancery Division. The [[Lord Chancellor]] combines other aspects of the constitution, including having certain ecclesiastical functions of the [[Church of England|established state church]], making certain church appointments, nominations and sitting as one of the thirty-three Church Commissioners. These functions remain intact and unaffected by the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005|Constitutional Reform Act]]. In 2005, the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005|Constitutional Reform Act]] separated the powers with Legislative functions going to an elected [[Lord Speaker]] and the Judicial functions going to the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]]. The [[Lord Chancellor's Department]] was replaced with a [[Ministry of Justice]] and the [[Lord Chancellor]] currently serves in the position of [[Secretary of State for Justice]].\n\nThe judiciary has no power to strike down primary legislation, and can only rule on secondary legislation that it is invalid with regard to the primary legislation if necessary.\n\nUnder the concept of [[parliamentary sovereignty]], [[Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons|Parliament]] can enact any primary legislation it chooses. However, the concept immediately becomes problematic when the question is asked, \"If parliament can do anything, can it bind its successors?\" It is generally held that parliament can do no such thing.\n\nEqually, while statute takes precedence over precedent-derived common law and the judiciary has no power to strike down primary legislation, there are certain cases where the supreme judicature has effected an injunction against the application of an act or reliance on its authority by the civil service. The seminal example of this is the [[Factortame litigation|Factortame case]], where the House of Lords granted such an injunction preventing the operation of the ''Merchant Shipping Act 1988'' until litigation in the European Court of Justice had been resolved.\n\nThe House of Lords ruling in Factortame (No. 1), approving the European Court of Justice formulation that \"a national court which, in a case before it concerning Community law, considers that the sole obstacle which precludes it from granting interim relief is a rule of national law, must disapply that rule\", has created an implicit tiering of legislative reviewability; the only way for parliament to prevent the supreme judicature from injunctively striking out a law on the basis of incompatibility with Community law is to pass an act specifically removing that power from the court, or by repealing the ''European Communities Act 1972''.\n\nThe British legal systems are based on [[common law]] traditions, which require:\n* [[Police]] or [[Regulatory agency|regulators]] cannot initiate complaints under [[criminal law]] but can only investigate (prosecution is mostly reserved for the [[Crown Prosecution Service]]), which prevents [[selective enforcement]]\u2014e.g., the \"[[fishing expedition]],\" which is often specifically forbidden.\n* [[Prosecutor]]s cannot withhold evidence from [[Lawyer|counsel]] for the [[defendant]]; to do so results in [[Mistrials|mistrial]] or dismissal. Accordingly, their relation to police is no advantage.\n* [[Defendant]]s convicted can [[appeal (law)|appeal]], but only fresh and compelling evidence not available at trial can be introduced, restricting the power of the [[court of appeal]] to the process of law applied.\n\n==== United States ====\n{{Main|Separation of powers under the United States Constitution}}\n[[File:Washington Constitutional Convention 1787.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[George Washington]] at [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] of 1787, signing of U.S. Constitution]]\n[[File:Justice Antonin Scalia on Separation of Powers and Checks and Balances.webm|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] Justice [[Antonin Scalia]] testified before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] about separation of powers and checks and balances of the U.S. Government]]\n\nSeparation of powers was first established in the [[United States Constitution]], wherein the founding fathers included features of many new concepts, including hard-learned historical lessons about the checks and balances of power. Similar concepts were also prominent in the state governments of the United States. As colonies of Great Britain, the founding fathers considered that the American states had suffered an abuse of the broad power of parliamentarism and monarchy. As a remedy, the United States Constitution limits the powers of the federal government through various means\u2014in particular, the three branches of the federal government are divided by exercising different functions. The executive and legislative powers are separated in origin by separate elections, and the judiciary is kept independent. Each branch controls the actions of others and balances its powers in some way.\n\nIn the Constitution, Article 1 Section I grants Congress only those \"legislative powers herein granted\" and proceeds to list those permissible actions in Article I Section 8, while Section 9 lists actions that are prohibited for Congress. The vesting clause in Article II places no limits on the Executive branch, simply stating that \"The Executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution.html |title=Constitution of the United States |publisher=Archives.gov |date=2000-09-15 |accessdate=2013-05-05}}</ref> The Supreme Court holds \"The judicial Power\" according to Article III, and [[judicial review]] was established in ''[[Marbury v.

The people appoint their representatives to meet periodically in a legislative body, and, since they do not have a king, the people themselves elect a preeminent citizen to perform, also periodically, the executive functions of the State. \n\nThe direct election of the head of state or of the executive power is an inevitable consequence of the political freedom of the people, understood as the capacity to appoint and depose their leaders. Only this separate election of the person who has to fulfill the functions that the Constitution attributes to the president, so different by its nature and by its function from the election of representatives of the electors, allows the executive power to be controlled by the legislative and submitted to the demands of political responsibility.<ref>{{Cite book|author-link=Antonio Garcia-Trevijano|title=A Pure Theory of Democracy|last=Garcia-Trevijano|first=Antonio|date=2009-09-30|publisher=[[University Press of America]]|isbn=9780761848561|location=Lanham, Md|language=English|translator-last=Pe\u00f1aranda|translator-first=Miguel Rodr\u00edguez de}}</ref>{{Disputed inline||date=January 2020}}\n\n[[Judicial independence]] is maintained by appointments for life, which remove any dependence on the Executive, with voluntary retirement and a high threshold for dismissal by the Legislature, in addition to a salary that cannot be diminished during their service.\n\nThe [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] refers to the branches as \"branches of government\", while some systems use \"government\" exclusively to describe the executive.

Were this principle rigorously adhered to, it would require that all the appointments for the supreme executive, legislative, and judiciary magistracies should be drawn from the same fountain of authority, the people, through channels having no communication whatever with one another. Perhaps such a plan of constructing the several departments would be less difficult in practice than it may in contemplation appear. Some difficulties, however, and some additional expense would attend the execution of it. Some deviations, therefore, from the principle must be admitted. In the constitution of the judiciary department in particular, it might be inexpedient to insist rigorously on the principle: first, because peculiar qualifications being essential in the members, the primary consideration ought to be to select that mode of choice which best secures these qualifications; secondly, because the permanent tenure by which the appointments are held in that department, must soon destroy all sense of dependence on the authority conferring them.\n\nIt is equally evident, that the members of each department should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others, for the emoluments annexed to their offices.

An example of the problems this causes is the near complete political paralysis that results when the president, who has neither the power to veto nor the ability to dissolve the legislature and call new elections, cannot negotiate with the legislature when his party is in the minority.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.fpri.org/enotes/asia.20020418.rigger.taiwanpoliticalparalysis.html |title = E-Notes: Why Taiwan's Political Paralysis PersistsFPRI |publisher=Foreign Policy Research Institute |date=18 April 2002 |author=Shelley Rigger |access-date=2008-10-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050210073526/http://www.fpri.org/enotes/asia.20020418.rigger.taiwanpoliticalparalysis.html |archive-date = 10 February 2005 }}</ref> The examination and control yuans are marginal branches; their leaders as well as the leaders of the executive and judicial yuans are appointed by the president and confirmed by the legislative yuan. The legislature is the only branch that chooses its own leadership. The vice president has practically no responsibilities.\n\n===== People's Republic of China =====\n{{Main|Government of China}}\n\nThe central government of the People's Republic of China is divided among several state organs:\n# [[National People's Congress]] (NPC): the ultimate power of the state that makes the constitution and basic laws, and supervises and elects all following organs;\n# [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC): the permanent legislative organ that makes most laws, interprets the constitution and laws, conducts [[constitutional review]], and supervises all following organs;\n# [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]]: acts as a ceremonial [[head of state]] in compliance with decisions made by the NPCSC but exercises an independent power to nominate the Premier of the State Council;\n# [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] (synonymous with \"Central People's Government\"): the executive branch, whose [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] is the [[head of government]];\n# [[Central Military Commission (China)|Central Military Commission]] (CMC): the military branch, whose [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the national armed forces including the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA), the [[People's Armed Police]] (PAP), and the [[Militia (China)|Militia]];\n# [[National Supervisory Commission]] (NSC): the supervisory branch;\n# [[Supreme People's Court]] (SPC): the judicial branch;\n# [[Supreme People's Procuratorate]] (SPP): the prosecutorial branch.\n\n==== Belgium ====\n\n[[Belgium]] is currently a federated state that has imposed the ''{{Lang|la|trias politica}}'' on different governmental levels. The constitution of 1831, considered one of the most liberal of its time for limiting the powers of its monarch and imposing a rigorous system of separation of powers, is based on three principles (represented in the [[Schematic overview of Belgian institutions]]).\n\n''{{Lang|la|Trias politica}}'' (horizontal separation of powers):\n\n* The legislative power is attributed to a parliamentary body elected with through a representative general election system (one person, one vote).\n* The executive power is attributed to the Council of Ministers. Ministers are formally appointed by the King though in practice the [[prime minister]] decides the composition of his cabinet. The ministers are usually from the elected members of parliament (although non-elected people can also be nominated); however, they must first resign from their elected seat.\n* The judicial power is in the hands of the courts. Magistrates are nominated by the minister on proposal from a Council of the Magistrates.\n** Magistrates can be nominated to become a judge (sitting magistrates) or instructing judge (investigating judge) of Procureur (public prosecutor) (the standing magistrates).\n** The executive branch of the government is responsible for providing the physical means to execute its role (infrastructure, staff, financial means).\n** Judges and some other people cannot run for elected office while they are nominated to certain positions (military, police-officers, clergy, notaries, bailiffs).\n\n[[Subsidiarity]] (vertical separation of powers):\n* Supranational directives (EU legislation) and international treaties are subjected to approval of the federal level (the federal level being Belgium the nation state)\n* The federal level comprises the following:\n** A bicameral parliament (House of Representatives and Senate) (in 2014 this will be a directly elected house and an indirectly appointed Senate of the regions)\n** A federal government (led by the Prime Minister, ministers and secretaries of state)\n*** Tasked with overseeing justice, defence, foreign affairs, social security, and public health\n** High Court, Constitutional Court, Cassation Court and Council of State\n* The regional level comprises the following:\n** A unicameral parliament\n** A regional government led by the minister-president (ministers and secretaries of state) is tasked with regional matters\n* Provinces also have similar structures:\n** A unicameral provincial council\n** A nominated provincial governor assisted by deputies is tasked with provincial matters\n** Appellate Court, Assizes Court\n* An intermediate level of Arrondissements subdivides the provinces\n** it has only an executive level with arrondissemental commissars\n* City and communal entities (local government):\n** A city or communal council\n** A mayor, assisted by aldermen, is tasked with local matters\n** Magistrates Court, Correctional Court (three judges)\n** Justice of the peace and Police Court judges (single judge courts)\n\nSecularism (separation of state and religion):\n* The king, the head of state, holds no political authority and requires executive approval by a minister for every action and statement; he nominates the ministers but he does not choose them (his executive powers); he signs and decrees the laws voted in parliament (his legislative powers);\n* The head of state is commander in chief of the military (in title only), politically the military depends on the Minister of Defence and the chiefs of staff are responsible towards parliament and take their orders from the Minister of Defence and the government;\n* Certain functions are deemed incompatible and people must resign from their function if they want to assume responsibilities in another function (military commanders have never been government ministers, even during a war).\n\n==== Costa Rica ====\n\nIn the aftermath of the [[Costa Rican Civil War|43-day civil war]] in 1948 (after former [[President of Costa Rica|President]] and incumbent candidate [[Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia]] tried to take power through [[Voter fraud|fraud]], by not recognising the results of the [[1948 Costa Rican general election|presidential election]] that he had lost), the question of which transformational model the Costa Rican State would follow was the main issue that confronted the victors. A [[Constituent Assembly of Costa Rica|Constituent Assembly]] was elected by popular vote to draw up a new constitution, [[Costa Rican Constitution|enacted in 1949]], and remains in force. This document was an edit of the [[Costa Rican Constitution of 1871|constitution of 1871]], as the constituent assembly rejected more radical corporatist ideas proposed by the ruling [[Junta Fundadora de la Segunda Rep\u00fablica]] (which, although having come to power by military force, abolished the armed forces). Nonetheless, the new constitution increased centralization of power at the expense of municipalities and eliminated provincial government altogether, and at the time it increased the powers of congress and the judiciary.\n\nIt established the three supreme powers as the legislative, executive, and judicial branches, but also created two other autonomous state organs that have equivalent power, but not equivalent rank. The first is the [[Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones de Costa Rica]] (electoral branch), which controls elections and makes unique, unappealable decisions on their outcomes.\n\nThe second is the office of the [[Comptroller|Comptroller General]] (audit branch), an autonomous and independent organ nominally subordinate to the unicameral legislative assembly. All budgets of ministries and municipalities must pass through this agency, including the execution of budget items such as contracting for routine operations. The Comptroller also provides financial vigilance over government offices and office holders, and routinely brings actions to remove mayors for malfeasance, firmly establishing this organization as the fifth branch of the Republic.\n\n==== European Union ====\n\nThe [[European Union]] is a supranational polity, and is neither a country nor a federation; but as the EU wields political power it complies with the principle of separation of powers. There are seven [[institutions of the European Union]]. In intergovernmental matters, most power is concentrated in the [[Council of the European Union]]\u2014giving it the characteristics of a normal [[international organization]]. Here, all power at the EU level is in one branch. In the latter there are four main actors. The [[European Commission]] acts as an independent executive which is appointed by the Council in conjunction with the European Parliament; but the Commission also has a legislative role as the sole initiator of EU legislation.<ref>Bomberg, Elizabeth, Peterson, John, and [[Richard Corbett]], eds.

As well as both executive and legislative functions, the Commission arguably exercises a third, quasi-judicial, function under Articles 101 & 102 TFEU (competition law ); although the ECJ remains the final arbiter. The [[European Parliament]] is one half of the legislative branch and is directly elected. The Council itself acts both as the second half of the legislative branch and also holds some executive functions (some of which are exercised by the related [[European Council]] in practice). The [[European Court of Justice]] acts as the independent judicial branch, interpreting EU law and treaties. The remaining institution, the [[European Court of Auditors]], is an independent audit authority (due to the sensitive nature of fraud in the EU).\n* [[Council of the European Union]] \u2013 executive and legislative\n* [[European Commission]] \u2013 executive, legislative and quasi-judicial\n* [[European Council]] \u2013 executive\n* [[European Court of Auditors]] \u2013 audit\n* [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] and the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] \u2013 judicial\n* [[European Parliament]] \u2013 legislative\n\n==== Germany ====\nThe three branches in German government are further divided into six main bodies enshrined in the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]:\n* Federal President (''[[President of Germany|Bundespr\u00e4sident]]'') \u2013 formally executive, but mainly ''representative'' in daily politics\n* Federal Cabinet (''[[Bundesregierung]]'') \u2013 executive\n* Federal Diet (''[[Bundestag]]'') & Federal Council (''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'') \u2013 bicameral legislative\n* Federal Assembly (''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'') \u2013 presidential electoral college (consisting of the members of the Bundestag and electors from the [[States of Germany|constituent states]])\n* Federal Constitutional Court (''[[Bundesverfassungsgericht]]'') \u2013 judiciary\n\nBesides the constitutional court, the judicial branch at the federal level is made up of five supreme courts\u2014one for civil and criminal cases (''Bundesgerichtshof''), and one each for administrative, tax, labour, and social security issues. There are also state-based (''[[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder / Bundesl\u00e4nder]]'') courts beneath them, and a rarely used [[Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts of Germany|senate of the supreme courts]].\n\n==== Hungary ====\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=August 2014}}\nThe four independent branches of power in Hungary (the parliament, the government, the court system, and the office of the public accuser) are divided into six bodies:\n* [[National Assembly (Hungary)|Parliament]] (Magyar Orsz\u00e1ggy\u0171l\u00e9s): elected every 4 years by the people in a highly complex, one-round voting system\n* [[Government of Hungary|Government]] (Magyar Korm\u00e1ny): installed and removed by simple majority vote of the parliament, 4-year terms\n* [[Supreme Court of Hungary|Supreme Court]] (Legfels\u0151bb B\u00edr\u00f3s\u00e1g): Chief justice elected by qualified (2/3) majority of the parliament, no government oversight\n* [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional court]] (Alkotm\u00e1nyb\u00edr\u00f3s\u00e1g): members elected by qualified majority of the parliament for 8 years, this body nullifies laws and has no government oversight\n* [[Chief Prosecutor of Hungary|Chief public accuser]] (Legf\u0151bb \u00fcgy\u00e9sz): elected by qualified majority of the parliament, 6-year terms, office budget fixed, no government oversight\n* [[List of heads of state of Hungary|The President of the Republic]] (K\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1gi Eln\u00f6k) is elected by qualified majority of the Hungarian parliament for 5-year terms (cannot be reelected more than once). The President's task is to oversee the functioning of the democracy. Most of his/her powers are ceremonial only: like signing laws into power and commanding the military in time of peace. But before signing, he/she can also return accepted bills once with advices to the Parliament for reconsideration; he/she can also request nullification in advance from the Constitutional Court. He can negotiate with civil/professional unions regarding the bills. Without the President's permission, the country can neither declare war nor deploy the armed forces.\n\nThe independent pillar status of the Hungarian public accuser's office is a unique construction, loosely modelled on the system Portugal introduced after the 1974 victory of the [[Carnation Revolution]]. The public accuser (attorney general) body has become the fourth column of Hungarian democracy only in recent times: after communism fell in 1989, the office was made independent by a new clause (XI) of the Constitution. The change was meant to prevent abuse of state power, especially with regards to the use of false accusations against opposition politicians, who may be excluded from elections if locked in protracted or excessively severe court cases.\n\nTo prevent the Hungarian accuser's office from neglecting its duties, natural human private persons can submit investigation requests, called \"p\u00f3tmag\u00e1nv\u00e1d,\" directly to the courts if the accusers' office refuses to. Courts will decide if the allegations have merit and order police to act in lieu of the accuser's office if warranted. In its decision No. 42/2005, the Hungarian constitutional court declared that the government does not enjoy such privilege and the state is powerless to further pursue cases if the public accuser refuses to do so.\n\n==== Historical ====\nNotable examples of states after Montesquieu that had more than three powers include:\n{{Expand list|date=November 2018}}\n* Quadripartite Systems:\n** The [[Empire of Brazil]] (1822&ndash;1889) had, in addition to the three traditional powers, the '''moderating power''', which was exercised solely by the Emperor,<ref>https://repository.law.miami.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1171&context=fac_articles</ref> and whose function was resolving conflicts between the other powers.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Arm's length principle]]\n* [[Constitutional economics]]\n* [[Constitutionalism]]\n* [[Corruption Perceptions Index]]\n* [[Fourth Estate]]\n* [[Fifth power]]\n* [[Fusion of powers]]\n* [[Judicial activism]]\n* [[Judicial independence]]\n* [[Legal reform]]\n* [[Philosophy of law]]\n* [[Pith and substance]]\n* [[Consociationalism|Power sharing]]\n* [[Reserve power]]\n* [[Rule of Law]]\n* [[Rule according to higher law]]\n* [[Separation of church and state]]\n* [[Separation of duties]]\n* [[Signing statement]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Peter Barenboim, ''[http://www.florentine-society.ru/pdf/Biblical_Roots_of_Separation_of_Powers.pdf Biblical Roots of Separation of Powers]'', Moscow, Letny Sad, 2005. {{ISBN|5-94381-123-0}}, Permalink: http://lccn.loc.gov/2006400578\n* Biancamaria Fontana (ed.), ''[http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521033764 The Invention of the Modern Republic]'' (2007) {{ISBN|978-0-521-03376-3}}\n* W.

The title character ([[Jonas Armstrong]]) has returned to England after five years fighting in the [[Third Crusade]] as part of the King's Guard. He is shocked to find the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], [[Vaisey, Sheriff of Nottingham|Vaisey]] ([[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]]), running the town with an iron fist upon his return. Robin is soon made an outlaw, and takes it upon himself to steal from the rich to feed the poor along with his [[Merry Men|gang]], which consists of his best friend [[Much the Miller's Son|Much]] ([[Sam Troughton]]); two young men he saved from hanging, [[Will Scarlet]]t ([[Harry Lloyd]]) and [[Alan-a-Dale|Allan A Dale]] ([[Joe Armstrong (actor)|Joe Armstrong]]); the ex-leader of a band of outlaws already in the woods, [[Little John]] ([[Gordon Kennedy (actor)|Gordon Kennedy]]); and another young man named Roy (short for \"Royston White\") ([[William Beck (actor)|William Beck]]), who is killed in episode 4, and replaced in episode 5 by Djaq ([[Anjali Jay]]), a [[Saracen]] girl using the alias of her dead brother. Robin is pleased to find that [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]] ([[Lucy Griffiths (actress, born 1986)|Lucy Griffiths]]) is still unmarried. Their relationship becomes romantic on several occasions; however, she is trapped by the hold that the Sheriff's second-in-command, [[Guy of Gisbourne|Sir Guy of Gisborne]] ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]), has over her. Guy often puts Marian in difficult situations where she has to be with him to help those she loves. The Sheriff plots to kill [[Richard I of England|King Richard]] (played by [[Steven Waddington]]) in his role as leader of the Black Knights, who wish to place [[John of England|Prince John]] on the throne. The Sheriff constantly tries to capture or kill Robin and the outlaws for continuously interfering in his scheme to take over England. The second series sees the Sheriff step up his plans to take control, finally culminating in a battle in the Holy Land. As the outlaws foil the Sheriff's attack on King Richard, Guy of Gisborne kills Marian, while Djaq and Will decide to stay in the Holy Land after they encounter a friend of Djaq's uncle.\n\nThe third series staggered the entry of new characters and only Robin appeared in all thirteen episodes. As the series opens, [[Friar Tuck|Tuck]] ([[David Harewood]]), a spiritual preacher returning to England, and Kate ([[Joanne Froggatt]]), a Locksley villager, are introduced; both soon becoming part of Robin's gang. Isabella ([[Lara Pulver]]), Gisborne's younger sister who is running from an abusive husband, arrives soon after and starts a secret relationship with Robin. Her link to the castle through Gisborne is used by the gang while she plots revenge against her brother, but her thirst for independence, power, and vengeance soon leads her to become a ruthless Sheriff and a sworn enemy. [[Toby Stephens]] appears as Prince John in three episodes mid-series, successfully exploiting the rift between Gisborne and  Vaisey, leading to the latter's supposed death at Gisborne's hand. Gisborne is briefly made Sheriff before Isabella uses her influence to replace him, leaving Gisborne a fugitive, and following the death of a young villager with whom he was briefly imprisoned, seeking revenge. This opens the door to a liaison with Robin and sets up the tenth episode of the series, told largely through flashbacks, which revisits Robin and Gisborne's history. It features [[Dean Lennox Kelly]], [[Sophie Winkleman]], [[Paul Hilton (British actor)|Paul Hilton]], and [[Ian Reddington]] as Robin's father, Gisborne's parents, and another past Locksley villager respectively, and reveals the existence of Archer (played by [[Clive Standen]] from episode 11), the illegitimate child of Robin's father and Gisborne's mother, who Robin's dying father begs them to find. Archer is Robin's equal with a bow and arrow. (This, coupled with his biological ties to Robin, Gisborne and Isabella, led to speculation that he was set to take over the programme's lead role following Jonas Armstrong's departure.<ref name=\"easilyreplaced\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2009/06/10/clive_standen_robin_hood_feature.shtml|title=The new Robin Hood?|publisher=BBC Nottingham|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/robin-hood/robin-hood-%E2%80%93-clive-standen-new-lead|title=Robin Hood - Clive Standen, New Lead?|publisher=tvthrong.co.uk|date=26 June 2009|accessdate=2009-07-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702123057/http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/robin-hood/robin-hood-%E2%80%93-clive-standen-new-lead|archivedate=2 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>) Having found Archer, who promptly abandons them after escaping, Gisborne and Robin return to Nottingham with a tentative alliance formed, setting up the two-part series finale, where Robin and Gisborne decide to take Nottingham Castle to prepare for King Richard's return. Although they are lured into a trap set by Archer and Isabella, they succeed when Archer turns against his half-sister. However, Allan is killed by a storm of arrows when Vaisey reappears at the head of an army wielding [[Greek fire|Byzantine fire]]. Gisborne is killed in a sword fight with the Sheriff and Isabella as he defends the castle, and Robin is poisoned by the blade of Isabella. However, before succumbing to his wound, Robin evacuates the villagers from Nottingham, and fires a flaming arrow into the Byzantine fire stored in the castle. Vaisey and Isabella realize too late and perish with their army in an explosion that destroys Nottingham Castle. As the castle burns, Robin returns to Sherwood Forest, says goodbye to the remainder of his Merry Men and encourages Archer to take up the defense of the people of England. Robin heads off on his own, and is greeted by Marian in a vision to welcome him into the afterlife. The remaining outlaws find Robin's body, and after a small ceremony, set out to continue their quest to end suffering in England.\n\n== Episode guide ==\n{{Main article|List of Robin Hood (2006 TV series) episodes}}\n\n=== Media coverage ===\n\nOn Saturday 8 July 2006, the BBC showed the first [[teaser trailer]] for the series &mdash; a shot of a flaming arrow flying into the BBC One logo in the corner of the screen as the ''Robin Hood'' logo and \"Coming Soon\" were displayed above. This teaser ran either side of the ''Doctor Who'' series finale on BBC One, and was shown on several other occasions on various BBC channels over the following weeks. A longer trailer with actual dialogue from many of the characters was previewed in the Video Room of the [[Sherwood Forest]] Visitor Centre during the first week of August 2006, as part of the community's Robin Hood Festival.\n\nThe BBC's ''[[Radio Times]]'' listings magazine ran a short preview article for the series, as part of a feature showcasing the best of the autumn series television line-up, in its 2&ndash;8 September 2006 edition, published on 29 August 2006, the day after the tape theft story was publicised in the press (see [[Robin Hood (2006 TV series)#Tape theft|above]]). Wrote the magazine's correspondent Benji Wilson: \"Why watch it? You can't beat a good ruckus &mdash; Armstrong and his merry co-stars all enrolled at a specially-commissioned 'Hood academy' before filming in Hungary, where they were drilled in horse riding, sword skills and archery.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Benji|title=Stories to Stay in For|journal=[[Radio Times]]|volume=330|issue=4300|pages=12|publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]]|date=2 September 2006}}</ref> The article was accompanied by a large publicity photo of Armstrong in costume.\n\nThe first full reviews for the programme began appearing on 7 September 2006, after a preview of the opening episode had been shown at the press launch the previous evening. The website of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that: \"The challenge for the new Robin Hood is to appeal to younger viewers while pulling in their parents as well. It will be no easy task. About as difficult, in fact, as simultaneously firing two arrows from the same bow, and both hitting the target. But as Robin showed in the opening episode, it can be done.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2006/09/first_review_robin_hood.html|title=First review: Robin Hood|first=John|last=Plunkett|publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]]|date=7 September 2006|accessdate=2006-09-07 | location=London}}</ref> In ''[[The Times]]'', critic [[Paul Hoggart]] backed the series to be a success: \"Armstrong as the rather understated Robin Hood should still be moodily cheeky enough to find his way on to the bedroom walls of a few hundred thousand pubertal girls, and Lucy Griffiths as Marian is inevitably feisty. But the villains steal the show, with Richard Armitage's Guy of Gisborne off-setting Keith Allen's gags as the mocking, heavily sarcastic Sheriff. The audience including cast, crew and their friends cheered at the end but this remake should go down well with families at home, too.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,23569-2348506,00.html|title=Old villains steal new show|first=Paul|last=Hoggart|publisher=[[The Times]]|date=7 September 2006|accessdate=2006-09-07 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nThe BBC began running longer trailers for the programme on Saturday 16 September 2006, with the first being shown following the final episode of ''[[How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?]]'' on BBC One.

The extended Robin version, featuring Armstrong escaping from a cell, was shown in [[movie theatre|cinema]]s.

The title character ([[Jonas Armstrong]]) has returned to England after five years fighting in the [[Third Crusade]] as part of the King's Guard. He is shocked to find the [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], [[Vaisey, Sheriff of Nottingham|Vaisey]] ([[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]]), running the town with an iron fist upon his return. Robin is soon made an outlaw, and takes it upon himself to steal from the rich to feed the poor along with his [[Merry Men|gang]], which consists of his best friend [[Much the Miller's Son|Much]] ([[Sam Troughton]]); two young men he saved from hanging, [[Will Scarlet]]t ([[Harry Lloyd]]) and [[Alan-a-Dale|Allan A Dale]] ([[Joe Armstrong (actor)|Joe Armstrong]]); the ex-leader of a band of outlaws already in the woods, [[Little John]] ([[Gordon Kennedy (actor)|Gordon Kennedy]]); and another young man named Roy (short for \"Royston White\") ([[William Beck (actor)|William Beck]]), who is killed in episode 4, and replaced in episode 5 by Djaq ([[Anjali Jay]]), a [[Saracen]] girl using the alias of her dead brother. Robin is pleased to find that [[Maid Marian|Lady Marian]] ([[Lucy Griffiths (actress, born 1986)|Lucy Griffiths]]) is still unmarried. Their relationship becomes romantic on several occasions; however, she is trapped by the hold that the Sheriff's second-in-command, [[Guy of Gisbourne|Sir Guy of Gisborne]] ([[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]]), has over her. Guy often puts Marian in difficult situations where she has to be with him to help those she loves. The Sheriff plots to kill [[Richard I of England|King Richard]] (played by [[Steven Waddington]]) in his role as leader of the Black Knights, who wish to place [[John of England|Prince John]] on the throne. The Sheriff constantly tries to capture or kill Robin and the outlaws for continuously interfering in his scheme to take over England. The second series sees the Sheriff step up his plans to take control, finally culminating in a battle in the Holy Land. As the outlaws foil the Sheriff's attack on King Richard, Guy of Gisborne kills Marian, while Djaq and Will decide to stay in the Holy Land after they encounter a friend of Djaq's uncle.\n\nThe third series staggered the entry of new characters and only Robin appeared in all thirteen episodes. As the series opens, [[Friar Tuck|Tuck]] ([[David Harewood]]), a spiritual preacher returning to England, and Kate ([[Joanne Froggatt]]), a Locksley villager, are introduced; both soon becoming part of Robin's gang. Isabella ([[Lara Pulver]]), Gisborne's younger sister who is running from an abusive husband, arrives soon after and starts a secret relationship with Robin. Her link to the castle through Gisborne is used by the gang while she plots revenge against her brother, but her thirst for independence, power, and vengeance soon leads her to become a ruthless Sheriff and a sworn enemy. [[Toby Stephens]] appears as Prince John in three episodes mid-series, successfully exploiting the rift between Gisborne and  Vaisey, leading to the latter's supposed death at Gisborne's hand. Gisborne is briefly made Sheriff before Isabella uses her influence to replace him, leaving Gisborne a fugitive, and following the death of a young villager with whom he was briefly imprisoned, seeking revenge. This opens the door to a liaison with Robin and sets up the tenth episode of the series, told largely through flashbacks, which revisits Robin and Gisborne's history. It features [[Dean Lennox Kelly]], [[Sophie Winkleman]], [[Paul Hilton (British actor)|Paul Hilton]], and [[Ian Reddington]] as Robin's father, Gisborne's parents, and another past Locksley villager respectively, and reveals the existence of Archer (played by [[Clive Standen]] from episode 11), the illegitimate child of Robin's father and Gisborne's mother, who Robin's dying father begs them to find. Archer is Robin's equal with a bow and arrow. (This, coupled with his biological ties to Robin, Gisborne and Isabella, led to speculation that he was set to take over the programme's lead role following Jonas Armstrong's departure.<ref name=\"easilyreplaced\" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2009/06/10/clive_standen_robin_hood_feature.shtml|title=The new Robin Hood?|publisher=BBC Nottingham|date=10 June 2009|accessdate=2009-07-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/robin-hood/robin-hood-%E2%80%93-clive-standen-new-lead|title=Robin Hood - Clive Standen, New Lead?|publisher=tvthrong.co.uk|date=26 June 2009|accessdate=2009-07-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702123057/http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/robin-hood/robin-hood-%E2%80%93-clive-standen-new-lead|archivedate=2 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>) Having found Archer, who promptly abandons them after escaping, Gisborne and Robin return to Nottingham with a tentative alliance formed, setting up the two-part series finale, where Robin and Gisborne decide to take Nottingham Castle to prepare for King Richard's return. Although they are lured into a trap set by Archer and Isabella, they succeed when Archer turns against his half-sister. However, Allan is killed by a storm of arrows when Vaisey reappears at the head of an army wielding [[Greek fire|Byzantine fire]]. Gisborne is killed in a sword fight with the Sheriff and Isabella as he defends the castle, and Robin is poisoned by the blade of Isabella. However, before succumbing to his wound, Robin evacuates the villagers from Nottingham, and fires a flaming arrow into the Byzantine fire stored in the castle. Vaisey and Isabella realize too late and perish with their army in an explosion that destroys Nottingham Castle. As the castle burns, Robin returns to Sherwood Forest, says goodbye to the remainder of his Merry Men and encourages Archer to take up the defense of the people of England. Robin heads off on his own, and is greeted by Marian in a vision to welcome him into the afterlife. The remaining outlaws find Robin's body, and after a small ceremony, set out to continue their quest to end suffering in England.\n\n== Episode guide ==\n{{Main article|List of Robin Hood (2006 TV series) episodes}}\n\n=== Media coverage ===\n\nOn Saturday 8 July 2006, the BBC showed the first [[teaser trailer]] for the series &mdash; a shot of a flaming arrow flying into the BBC One logo in the corner of the screen as the ''Robin Hood'' logo and \"Coming Soon\" were displayed above. This teaser ran either side of the ''Doctor Who'' series finale on BBC One, and was shown on several other occasions on various BBC channels over the following weeks. A longer trailer with actual dialogue from many of the characters was previewed in the Video Room of the [[Sherwood Forest]] Visitor Centre during the first week of August 2006, as part of the community's Robin Hood Festival.\n\nThe BBC's ''[[Radio Times]]'' listings magazine ran a short preview article for the series, as part of a feature showcasing the best of the autumn series television line-up, in its 2&ndash;8 September 2006 edition, published on 29 August 2006, the day after the tape theft story was publicised in the press (see [[Robin Hood (2006 TV series)#Tape theft|above]]). Wrote the magazine's correspondent Benji Wilson: \"Why watch it? You can't beat a good ruckus &mdash; Armstrong and his merry co-stars all enrolled at a specially-commissioned 'Hood academy' before filming in Hungary, where they were drilled in horse riding, sword skills and archery.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Benji|title=Stories to Stay in For|journal=[[Radio Times]]|volume=330|issue=4300|pages=12|publisher=[[BBC Worldwide]]|date=2 September 2006}}</ref> The article was accompanied by a large publicity photo of Armstrong in costume.\n\nThe first full reviews for the programme began appearing on 7 September 2006, after a preview of the opening episode had been shown at the press launch the previous evening. The website of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said that: \"The challenge for the new Robin Hood is to appeal to younger viewers while pulling in their parents as well. It will be no easy task. About as difficult, in fact, as simultaneously firing two arrows from the same bow, and both hitting the target.

But the villains steal the show, with Richard Armitage's Guy of Gisborne off-setting Keith Allen's gags as the mocking, heavily sarcastic Sheriff.

[[Fort Morris]] was constructed in Sunbury by the authority of the [[Continental Congress]].  A contingent of British soldiers attempted to take the fort on November 25, 1778.  The American contingent at Fort Morris was led by Colonel John McIntosh (c. 1748\u20131826).<ref>[http://www.glynngen.com/military/amrev/glynn/mcintoshjno.htm GlynnGen.com Coastal Georgia Genealogy Page on John McIntosh]</ref>  The Americans numbered only 127 Continental soldiers plus militiamen and local citizens. The fort itself was crudely constructed and could not have withstood any concerted attack.\n\nThe British commander, Colonel Fuser, demanded Fort Morris' surrender through a written note to the American rebels. Though clearly outnumbered (he had only about 200 men plus artillery), Colonel McIntosh's defiant written response to the British demand included the following line: \"As to surrendering the fort, receive this [[laconic phrase|laconic reply]]: COME AND TAKE IT!\".  The British declined to attack, in large part due to their lack of [[military intelligence|intelligence]] regarding other forces in the area. Colonel Fuser believed a recent skirmish in the area, combined with Colonel McIntosh's bravado, might have reflected reinforcements and so the British withdrew.\n\nThe British returned in January 1779 with a larger force.

[[Fort Morris]] was constructed in Sunbury by the authority of the [[Continental Congress]].  A contingent of British soldiers attempted to take the fort on November 25, 1778.  The American contingent at Fort Morris was led by Colonel John McIntosh (c. 1748\u20131826).<ref>[http://www.glynngen.com/military/amrev/glynn/mcintoshjno.htm GlynnGen.com Coastal Georgia Genealogy Page on John McIntosh]</ref>  The Americans numbered only 127 Continental soldiers plus militiamen and local citizens. The fort itself was crudely constructed and could not have withstood any concerted attack.\n\nThe British commander, Colonel Fuser, demanded Fort Morris' surrender through a written note to the American rebels. Though clearly outnumbered (he had only about 200 men plus artillery), Colonel McIntosh's defiant written response to the British demand included the following line: \"As to surrendering the fort, receive this [[laconic phrase|laconic reply]]: COME AND TAKE IT!\".  The British declined to attack, in large part due to their lack of [[military intelligence|intelligence]] regarding other forces in the area. Colonel Fuser believed a recent skirmish in the area, combined with Colonel McIntosh's bravado, might have reflected reinforcements and so the British withdrew.\n\nThe British returned in January 1779 with a larger force. They later conquered and controlled nearly all of Georgia for the next few years.<ref>[http://ngeorgia.com/history/nghistar.html North Georgia History]</ref>  Col.
