He first attracted notice in [[vaudeville]] in the US and then as \"Harry 'Handcuff' Houdini\" on a tour of Europe, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up. Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, [[straitjacket]]s under water, and having to escape from and [[apnea|hold his breath]] inside a sealed milk can with water in it.\n\nIn 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special [[handcuff]]s commissioned by London's ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake [[spiritualist]]s. As President of the [[Society of American Magicians]], he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts.\n\nHoudini made several movies but quit acting when it failed to bring in money.

For the rest of Houdini's performing career, Bess worked as his stage assistant.\n\nHoudini's big break came in 1899 when he met manager [[Martin Beck (vaudeville)|Martin Beck]] in St. Paul, Minnesota. Impressed by Houdini's [[handcuffs]] act, Beck advised him to concentrate on escape acts and booked him on the [[Orpheum Circuit|Orpheum]] [[vaudeville]] circuit. Within months, he was performing at the top vaudeville houses in the country. In 1900, Beck arranged for Houdini to tour Europe. After some days of unsuccessful interviews in London, Houdini's British agent [[Harry Day (politician)|Harry Day]] helped him to get an interview with [[C.

In each city, Houdini challenged local police to restrain him with [[shackle]]s and lock him in their jails. In many of these challenge escapes, he was first [[strip search|stripped nude and searched]]. In Moscow, he escaped from a Siberian prison transport van, claiming that, had he been unable to free himself, he would have had to travel to Siberia, where the only key was kept. In [[Cologne]], he sued a police officer, Werner Graff, who alleged that he made his escapes via bribery.<ref>Silverman, p. 81.</ref> Houdini won the case when he opened the judge's safe (he later said the judge had forgotten to lock it). With his new-found wealth, Houdini purchased a dress said to have been made for [[Queen Victoria]].

He freed himself from jails, handcuffs, chains, ropes, and [[straitjacket]]s, often while hanging from a rope in sight of street audiences. Because of imitators, Houdini put his \"handcuff act\" behind him on January 25, 1908, and began escaping from a locked, water-filled milk can. The possibility of failure and death thrilled his audiences. Houdini also expanded his repertoire with his escape challenge act, in which he invited the public to devise contraptions to hold him.

He would go on performing this escape for the rest of his life.\n\nDuring his career, Houdini explained some of his tricks in books written for the magic brotherhood. In ''Handcuff Secrets'' (1909), he revealed how many locks and handcuffs could be opened with properly applied force, others with shoestrings. Other times, he carried concealed [[lock picking|lockpicks]] or keys.

Houdini's brother (who was also an escape artist, billing himself as [[Theodore Hardeen]]) discovered that audiences were more impressed when the curtains were eliminated so they could watch him struggle to get out. On more than one occasion, they both performed straitjacket escapes while dangling upside-down from the roof of a building in the same city.<ref name=\"secret\"/>\n\nFor most of his career, Houdini was a headline act in [[vaudeville]].

The business is still in operation today.\n\nHe also served as President of [[the Society of American Magicians]] ({{aka}} S.A.M.) from 1917 until his death in 1926. Founded on May 10, 1902, in the back room of [[Martinka]]'s magic shop in New York, the Society expanded under the leadership of Harry Houdini during his term as National President from 1917 to 1926. Houdini was magic's greatest visionary. He sought to create a large, unified national network of professional and amateur magicians. Wherever he traveled, he gave a lengthy formal address to the local magic club, made speeches, and usually threw a banquet for the members at his own expense. He said \"The Magicians Clubs as a rule are small: they are weak ... but if we were amalgamated into one big body the society would be stronger, and it would mean making the small clubs powerful and worthwhile. Members would find a welcome wherever they happened to be and, conversely, the safeguard of a city-to-city hotline to track exposers and other undesirables.\"\n\nFor most of 1916, while on his vaudeville tour, Houdini had been recruiting\u2014at his own expense\u2014local magic clubs to join the S.A.M. in an effort to revitalize what he felt was a weak organization. Houdini persuaded groups in Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City to join. As had happened in London, he persuaded magicians to join. The Buffalo club joined as the first branch, (later assembly) of the Society. Chicago Assembly No. 3 was, as the name implies, the third regional club to be established by the S.A.M., whose assemblies now number in the hundreds. In 1917, he signed Assembly Number Three's charter into existence, and that charter and this club continue to provide Chicago magicians with a connection to each other and to their past. Houdini dined with, addressed, and got pledges from similar clubs in Detroit, Rochester, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Cincinnati and elsewhere. This was the biggest movement ever in the history of magic. In places where no clubs existed, he rounded up individual magicians, introduced them to each other, and urged them into the fold.\n\nBy the end of 1916, magicians' clubs in San Francisco and other cities that Houdini had not visited were offering to become assemblies. He had created the richest and longest-surviving organization of magicians in the world. It now embraces almost 6,000 dues-paying members and almost 300 assemblies worldwide. In July 1926, Houdini was elected for the ninth successive time President of the Society of American Magicians. Every other president has only served for one year.

Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matin\u00e9e performance at London's Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his \"ghost house\" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The ''Mirror'' representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56&nbsp;minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the 6-inch key.<ref>''The Secret Life of Houdini'', Kaulush & Sloman, 2006.</ref> Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career.<ref>{{cite web |title=Houdini's Mirror Handcuff Challenge, Getting Closer to the Truth |first=Mick |last=Hanzlik |year=2007 |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/09/mick-hanzlik-completes-mirror-handcuff.html}} Reproduction in full of ''Daily Mirror'' article \"Houdini's Great Victory\", March 18, 1904.</ref>\n\nAfter Houdini's death, his friend Martin Beck was quoted in [[Will Goldston]]'s book, ''Sensational Tales of Mystery Men'', as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the ''Mirror'' representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book ''The Secret Life of Houdini'' that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the ''Mirror'' challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.<ref>Silverman, pp.&nbsp;59\u201362.</ref>\n\nThis escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channel's ''[[Mysteries at the Museum]]'' in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scranton's Houdini Museum.<ref name=mysteries>{{cite web| title=Keys To Houdini's Secrets| publisher=[[Travel Channel]]| series=[[Mysteries at the Museum]]| date=November 23, 2010| accessdate=November 9, 2015| url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/mysteries-at-the-museum/video/the-secret-to-houdini-s-tricks}}</ref>\n\nA full-sized design of the same Mirror Handcuffs, as well as a replica of the [[Bramah lock|Bramah style]] key for it, is on display to the public at [[The Houdini Museum]] in Scranton, Pennsylvania.<ref name=Genii>{{cite web| url=http://www.geniimagazine.com/magicpedia/Mirror_Cuffs| title=Mirror Cuffs| work=Genii Magazine| accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUNaBSfO3p4| title=Travel Channel Dorothy Dietrich Promo Houdini Mirror Cuffs| publisher=Travel Channel| series=Mysteries at the Museum| accessdate=November 29, 2011}}</ref> This set of cuffs is believed to be one of only six in the world, some of which are not on display.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2013/03/guest-blog-replica-mirror-cuffs.html|title=The Replica Mirror Cuffs|first=Mick|last=Hanzlik|publisher=Wild About Harry|date=March 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===''Milk Can Escape''===\nIn 1908, Houdini introduced his own original act, the Milk Can Escape.<ref>Randi, pp. 175\u2013178.</ref> In this act, Houdini was handcuffed and sealed inside an oversized milk can filled with water and made his escape behind a curtain. As part of the effect, Houdini invited members of the audience to hold their breath along with him while he was inside the can.

In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked in stocks, and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water. The mahogany and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini. The stocks were locked to the top of the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape. In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that. While making the escape more difficult \u2013 the cage prevented Houdini from turning \u2013 the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break. The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called \"Houdini Upside Down\". This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did. While the escape was advertised as \"The Chinese Water Torture Cell\" or \"The Water Torture Cell\", Houdini always referred to it as \"the Upside Down\" or \"USD\". The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in Berlin, on September 21, 1912. Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926.<ref name=\"secret\"/>\n\n===Suspended straitjacket escape===\nOne of Houdini's most popular publicity stunts was to have himself strapped into a regulation straitjacket and suspended by his ankles from a tall building or crane. Houdini would then make his [[Straitjacket#Escape techniques|escape]] in full view of the assembled crowd. In many cases, Houdini drew tens of thousands of onlookers who brought city traffic to a halt. Houdini would sometimes ensure press coverage by performing the escape from the office building of a local newspaper. In New York City, Houdini performed the suspended straitjacket escape from a crane being used to build the [[New York City Subway|subway]]. After flinging his body in the air, he escaped from the straitjacket. Starting from when he was hoisted up in the air by the crane, to when the straitjacket was completely off, it took him two minutes and thirty-seven seconds. There is film footage in the Library of Congress of Houdini performing the escape.<ref>\"[http://lccn.loc.gov/94505242 Thousands see Harry Houdini escape from a straitjacket while hanging in mid-air, Chicago, Ill.]\", International news [1923 or 1924?]</ref> Films of his escapes are also shown at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. After being battered against a building in high winds during one escape, Houdini performed the escape with a visible safety wire on his ankle so that he could be pulled away from the building if necessary. The idea for the upside-down escape was given to Houdini by a young boy named [[Randolph Osborne Douglas]] (March 31, 1895&nbsp;\u2013 December 5, 1956), when the two met at a performance at [[Sheffield]]'s Empire Theatre.<ref name=\"secret\"/>\n\n===Overboard box escape===\n[[File:HoudiniSubmergedCrate.jpg|thumb|left|Houdini prepares to do the overboard box escape c. 1912]]\nAnother of Houdini's most famous publicity stunts was to escape from a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water. He first performed the escape in New York's East River on July 7, 1912. Police forbade him from using one of the piers, so he hired a tugboat and invited press on board. Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead. The crate was then lowered into the water. He escaped in 57 seconds. The crate was pulled to the surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside.\n\nHoudini performed this escape many times, and even performed a version on stage, first at Hamerstein's Roof Garden where a {{convert|5500|USgal|l|adj=on}} tank was specially built, and later at the [[New York Hippodrome]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Houdini His Legend and His Magic| last=Henning| first=Doug| authorlink=Doug Henning| date=December 1, 1977| publisher=[[Times Books]]| page=| url=https://books.google.com/?id=qtMTAQAAIAAJ&q=hamerstein%27s+roof | isbn=9780812906868}}</ref>\n\n===Buried alive stunt===\nHoudini performed at least three variations on a [[Premature burial|buried alive]] stunt during his career. The first was near Santa Ana, California in 1915, and it almost cost Houdini his life. Houdini was buried, without a casket, in a pit of earth six feet deep. He became exhausted and panicked while trying to dig his way to the surface and called for help. When his hand finally broke the surface, he fell unconscious and had to be pulled from the grave by his assistants. Houdini wrote in his diary that the escape was \"very dangerous\" and that \"the weight of the earth is killing\".<ref>{{cite book| last=Christopher| first=Milbourne| title=Houdini: The Untold Story| url=https://archive.org/details/houdiniuntoldsto00chri| url-access=registration| date=1969| isbn=978-0891909811| page=[https://archive.org/details/houdiniuntoldsto00chri/page/140 140]| publisher=Ty Crowell Co.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/01/digging-into-buried-alive.html |title=Digging into Houdini's Buried Alive |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nHoudini's second variation on buried alive was an endurance test designed to expose mystical Egyptian performer Rahman Bey, who had claimed to use supernatural powers to remain in a sealed casket for an hour. Houdini bettered Bey on August 5, 1926, by remaining in a sealed casket, or coffin, submerged in the swimming pool of New York's Hotel Shelton for one and a half hours. Houdini claimed he did not use any trickery or supernatural powers to accomplish this feat, just controlled breathing.<ref>Silverman, pp.&nbsp;397\u2013403.</ref> He repeated the feat at the YMCA in Worcester, Massachusetts on September 28, 1926, this time remaining sealed for one hour and eleven minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/01/uncovering-houdinis-forgotten-second.html |title=Uncovering Houdini's second underwater test |accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHoudini's final buried alive was an elaborate stage escape that featured in his full evening show. Houdini would escape after being strapped in a straitjacket, sealed in a casket, and then buried in a large tank filled with sand. While posters advertising the escape exist (playing off the Bey challenge by boasting \"Egyptian Fakirs Outdone!\"), it is unclear whether Houdini ever performed buried alive on stage. The stunt was to be the feature escape of his 1927 season, but Houdini died on October 31, 1926. The bronze casket Houdini created for buried alive was used to transport Houdini's body from Detroit to New York following his death on [[Halloween]].<ref>Silverman, p. 406.</ref>\n\n==Movie career==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 200\n | image1    = Mastermystery-1919poster.jpg\n | alt1      = ''The Houdini Serial'', 1919 movie poster\n | caption1  = ''The Houdini Serial'', 1919 movie poster\n | image2    = Grim game.jpg\n | alt2      = ''[[The Grim Game]]'', 1919 movie poster\n | caption2  = ''The Grim Game'', 1919 movie poster\n}}\n[[File:The Master Mystery (trailer) - Burton King - 1919, B.A. Rolfe Photoplays - EYE FLM41533 - OB 685697.webm|thumb|Silent movie ''The Master Mystery'' (1919).

That same year Houdini got an offer to star as [[Captain Nemo]] in a silent version of ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'', but the project never made it into production.<ref>Silverman, p. 205.</ref>\nIt is often erroneously reported that Houdini served as special-effects consultant on the Wharton/International cliffhanger serial, ''The Mysteries of Myra'', shot in Ithaca, New York, because Harry Grossman, director of ''The Master Mystery'' also filmed a serial in Ithaca at about the same time. The consultants on the serial were pioneering [[Hereward Carrington]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stedman |first1=Eric |title=The Mysteries of Myra |year=2010 |page=8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Houdini signed a contract with film producer [[B. A. Rolfe]] to star in a 15-part [[serial (film)|serial]], ''[[The Master Mystery]]'' (released in November 1918). As was common at the time, the film serial was released simultaneously with a novel. Financial difficulties resulted in [[Rolfe Photoplays Inc.|B. A. Rolfe Productions]] going out of business, but ''The Master Mystery'' led to Houdini being signed by [[Famous Players-Lasky Corporation]]/[[Paramount Pictures]], for whom he made two pictures, ''The Grim Game'' (1919) and ''[[Terror Island]]'' (1920).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/12/adroit-harry-and-ancient-hokum.html |title=Adroit Harry and ancient hokum |accessdate=December 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Grim Game]]'' was Houdini's first full-length movie and is reputed to be his best. Because of the flammable nature of nitrate film and the inherent chemical instability of the [[Safety film#Decay and the .22vinegar syndrome.22|acetate \"safety\" film]] that supplanted it, only 10 percent of old silent movies exist. Film historians considered the film lost. One copy did exist hidden in the collection of a private collector only known to a tiny group of magicians that saw it. Dick Brookz and Dorothy Dietrich of The Houdini Museum in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] had seen it twice on the invitation of the collector.

Publicity was geared heavily toward promoting this dramatic \"caught on film\" moment, claiming it was Houdini himself dangling from the plane. While filming these movies in Los Angeles, Houdini rented a home in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Laurel Canyon]]. Following his two-picture stint in Hollywood, Houdini returned to New York and started his own film production company called the \"Houdini Picture Corporation\". He produced and starred in two films, ''[[The Man from Beyond]]'' (1921) and ''[[Haldane of the Secret Service]]'' (1923). He also founded his own film laboratory business called The Film Development Corporation (FDC), gambling on a new process for developing motion picture film. Houdini's brother, [[Theodore Hardeen]], left his own career as a magician and escape artist to run the company. Magician [[Harry Kellar]] was a major investor.<ref>Silverman, pp. 226\u2013249.</ref>\n\nNeither Houdini's acting career nor FDC found success, and he gave up on the movie business in 1923, complaining that \"the profits are too meager\".\n\nIn April 2008, Kino International released a DVD box set of Houdini's surviving silent films, including ''The Master Mystery'', ''Terror Island'', ''The Man From Beyond'', ''Haldane of the Secret Service'', and five minutes from ''The Grim Game''.

Doyle, a firm believer in [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualism]] during his later years, refused to believe any of Houdini's expos\u00e9s. Doyle came to believe that Houdini was a powerful spiritualist medium, and had performed many of his stunts by means of paranormal abilities and was using these abilities to block those of other mediums that he was \"debunking\".<ref>see Conan Doyle's ''The Edge of The Unknown'', published in 1931.</ref> This disagreement led to the two men becoming public antagonists, and Sir Arthur came to view Houdini as a dangerous enemy.<ref name=\"secret\"/>\n\nBefore Houdini died, he and his wife agreed that if Houdini found it possible to communicate after death, he would communicate the message \"Rosabelle believe\", a secret code which they agreed to use. Rosabelle was their favorite song. Bess held yearly [[Seances|s\u00e9ances]] on [[Halloween]] for ten years after Houdini's death. She did claim to have contact through [[Arthur Ford (psychic)|Arthur Ford]] in 1929 when Ford conveyed the secret code, but Bess later said the incident had been faked. The code seems to have been such that it could be broken by Ford or his associates using existing clues.<ref name=\"secret\"/> Evidence to this effect was discovered by Ford's biographer after he died in 1971.<ref>{{cite book| first1=Allen| last1=Spragget| first2= William V.| last2=Rauscher| title=Arthur Ford: The Man Who Talked with the Dead| year=1974| publisher=[[New American Library]]| page=246}}</ref> In 1936, after a last unsuccessful s\u00e9ance on the roof of the [[Knickerbocker Hotel (Los Angeles)|Knickerbocker Hotel]], she put out the candle that she had kept burning beside a photograph of Houdini since his death.

It communicated to audiences at once warm amiability, pleasure in performing, and, more subtly, imperious self-assurance. Several reporters tried to capture the charming effect, describing him as \"happy-looking\", \"pleasant-faced\", \"good natured at all times\", \"the young Hungarian magician with the pleasant smile and easy confidence\".<ref>Silverman, p. 31.</ref>}}\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = Harry Houdini's voice.ogg\n| title       = Harry Houdini's voice\n| description = Recording of Harry Houdini's voice made on October 29, 1914\n}}\nHoudini made the only known recordings of his voice on Edison [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinder]]s on October 29, 1914, in [[Flatbush, New York]].

Price said that Whitehead asked Houdini \"if he believed in the miracles of the Bible\" and \"whether it was true that punches in the stomach did not hurt him\". He then delivered \"some very hammer-like blows below the belt\". Houdini was reclining on a couch at the time, having broken his ankle while performing several days earlier. Price said that Houdini winced at each blow and stopped Whitehead suddenly in the midst of a punch, gesturing that he had had enough, and adding that he had had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not expect Whitehead to strike him so suddenly and forcefully.

He first attracted notice in [[vaudeville]] in the US and then as \"Harry 'Handcuff' Houdini\" on a tour of Europe, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up. Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from skyscrapers, [[straitjacket]]s under water, and having to escape from and [[apnea|hold his breath]] inside a sealed milk can with water in it.\n\nIn 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special [[handcuff]]s commissioned by London's ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake [[spiritualist]]s. As President of the [[Society of American Magicians]], he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists.

In Moscow, he escaped from a Siberian prison transport van, claiming that, had he been unable to free himself, he would have had to travel to Siberia, where the only key was kept.

Because of imitators, Houdini put his \"handcuff act\" behind him on January 25, 1908, and began escaping from a locked, water-filled milk can. The possibility of failure and death thrilled his audiences. Houdini also expanded his repertoire with his escape challenge act, in which he invited the public to devise contraptions to hold him.

In ''Handcuff Secrets'' (1909), he revealed how many locks and handcuffs could be opened with properly applied force, others with shoestrings.

Houdini's brother (who was also an escape artist, billing himself as [[Theodore Hardeen]]) discovered that audiences were more impressed when the curtains were eliminated so they could watch him struggle to get out.

The business is still in operation today.\n\nHe also served as President of [[the Society of American Magicians]] ({{aka}} S.A.M.) from 1917 until his death in 1926. Founded on May 10, 1902, in the back room of [[Martinka]]'s magic shop in New York, the Society expanded under the leadership of Harry Houdini during his term as National President from 1917 to 1926. Houdini was magic's greatest visionary. He sought to create a large, unified national network of professional and amateur magicians. Wherever he traveled, he gave a lengthy formal address to the local magic club, made speeches, and usually threw a banquet for the members at his own expense. He said \"The Magicians Clubs as a rule are small: they are weak ... but if we were amalgamated into one big body the society would be stronger, and it would mean making the small clubs powerful and worthwhile. Members would find a welcome wherever they happened to be and, conversely, the safeguard of a city-to-city hotline to track exposers and other undesirables.\"\n\nFor most of 1916, while on his vaudeville tour, Houdini had been recruiting\u2014at his own expense\u2014local magic clubs to join the S.A.M. in an effort to revitalize what he felt was a weak organization. Houdini persuaded groups in Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City to join. As had happened in London, he persuaded magicians to join. The Buffalo club joined as the first branch, (later assembly) of the Society. Chicago Assembly No. 3 was, as the name implies, the third regional club to be established by the S.A.M., whose assemblies now number in the hundreds. In 1917, he signed Assembly Number Three's charter into existence, and that charter and this club continue to provide Chicago magicians with a connection to each other and to their past. Houdini dined with, addressed, and got pledges from similar clubs in Detroit, Rochester, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Cincinnati and elsewhere. This was the biggest movement ever in the history of magic. In places where no clubs existed, he rounded up individual magicians, introduced them to each other, and urged them into the fold.\n\nBy the end of 1916, magicians' clubs in San Francisco and other cities that Houdini had not visited were offering to become assemblies. He had created the richest and longest-surviving organization of magicians in the world. It now embraces almost 6,000 dues-paying members and almost 300 assemblies worldwide. In July 1926, Houdini was elected for the ninth successive time President of the Society of American Magicians. Every other president has only served for one year.

Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matin\u00e9e performance at London's Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his \"ghost house\" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The ''Mirror'' representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56&nbsp;minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the 6-inch key.<ref>''The Secret Life of Houdini'', Kaulush & Sloman, 2006.</ref> Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept.

Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the ''Mirror'' representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book ''The Secret Life of Houdini'' that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the ''Mirror'' challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.<ref>Silverman, pp.&nbsp;59\u201362.</ref>\n\nThis escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channel's ''[[Mysteries at the Museum]]'' in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scranton's Houdini Museum.<ref name=mysteries>{{cite web| title=Keys To Houdini's Secrets| publisher=[[Travel Channel]]| series=[[Mysteries at the Museum]]| date=November 23, 2010| accessdate=November 9, 2015| url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/mysteries-at-the-museum/video/the-secret-to-houdini-s-tricks}}</ref>\n\nA full-sized design of the same Mirror Handcuffs, as well as a replica of the [[Bramah lock|Bramah style]] key for it, is on display to the public at [[The Houdini Museum]] in Scranton, Pennsylvania.<ref name=Genii>{{cite web| url=http://www.geniimagazine.com/magicpedia/Mirror_Cuffs| title=Mirror Cuffs| work=Genii Magazine| accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUNaBSfO3p4| title=Travel Channel Dorothy Dietrich Promo Houdini Mirror Cuffs| publisher=Travel Channel| series=Mysteries at the Museum| accessdate=November 29, 2011}}</ref> This set of cuffs is believed to be one of only six in the world, some of which are not on display.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2013/03/guest-blog-replica-mirror-cuffs.html|title=The Replica Mirror Cuffs|first=Mick|last=Hanzlik|publisher=Wild About Harry|date=March 16, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===''Milk Can Escape''===\nIn 1908, Houdini introduced his own original act, the Milk Can Escape.<ref>Randi, pp. 175\u2013178.</ref> In this act, Houdini was handcuffed and sealed inside an oversized milk can filled with water and made his escape behind a curtain.

In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked in stocks, and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water. The mahogany and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini. The stocks were locked to the top of the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape. In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that. While making the escape more difficult \u2013 the cage prevented Houdini from turning \u2013 the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break. The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called \"Houdini Upside Down\". This was so he could copyright the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did. While the escape was advertised as \"The Chinese Water Torture Cell\" or \"The Water Torture Cell\", Houdini always referred to it as \"the Upside Down\" or \"USD\". The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in Berlin, on September 21, 1912. Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926.<ref name=\"secret\"/>\n\n===Suspended straitjacket escape===\nOne of Houdini's most popular publicity stunts was to have himself strapped into a regulation straitjacket and suspended by his ankles from a tall building or crane. Houdini would then make his [[Straitjacket#Escape techniques|escape]] in full view of the assembled crowd. In many cases, Houdini drew tens of thousands of onlookers who brought city traffic to a halt. Houdini would sometimes ensure press coverage by performing the escape from the office building of a local newspaper. In New York City, Houdini performed the suspended straitjacket escape from a crane being used to build the [[New York City Subway|subway]]. After flinging his body in the air, he escaped from the straitjacket. Starting from when he was hoisted up in the air by the crane, to when the straitjacket was completely off, it took him two minutes and thirty-seven seconds. There is film footage in the Library of Congress of Houdini performing the escape.<ref>\"[http://lccn.loc.gov/94505242 Thousands see Harry Houdini escape from a straitjacket while hanging in mid-air, Chicago, Ill.]\", International news [1923 or 1924?]</ref> Films of his escapes are also shown at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. After being battered against a building in high winds during one escape, Houdini performed the escape with a visible safety wire on his ankle so that he could be pulled away from the building if necessary. The idea for the upside-down escape was given to Houdini by a young boy named [[Randolph Osborne Douglas]] (March 31, 1895&nbsp;\u2013 December 5, 1956), when the two met at a performance at [[Sheffield]]'s Empire Theatre.<ref name=\"secret\"/>\n\n===Overboard box escape===\n[[File:HoudiniSubmergedCrate.jpg|thumb|left|Houdini prepares to do the overboard box escape c. 1912]]\nAnother of Houdini's most famous publicity stunts was to escape from a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water. He first performed the escape in New York's East River on July 7, 1912. Police forbade him from using one of the piers, so he hired a tugboat and invited press on board. Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead. The crate was then lowered into the water. He escaped in 57 seconds. The crate was pulled to the surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside.\n\nHoudini performed this escape many times, and even performed a version on stage, first at Hamerstein's Roof Garden where a {{convert|5500|USgal|l|adj=on}} tank was specially built, and later at the [[New York Hippodrome]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Houdini His Legend and His Magic| last=Henning| first=Doug| authorlink=Doug Henning| date=December 1, 1977| publisher=[[Times Books]]| page=| url=https://books.google.com/?id=qtMTAQAAIAAJ&q=hamerstein%27s+roof | isbn=9780812906868}}</ref>\n\n===Buried alive stunt===\nHoudini performed at least three variations on a [[Premature burial|buried alive]] stunt during his career. The first was near Santa Ana, California in 1915, and it almost cost Houdini his life. Houdini was buried, without a casket, in a pit of earth six feet deep. He became exhausted and panicked while trying to dig his way to the surface and called for help. When his hand finally broke the surface, he fell unconscious and had to be pulled from the grave by his assistants. Houdini wrote in his diary that the escape was \"very dangerous\" and that \"the weight of the earth is killing\".<ref>{{cite book| last=Christopher| first=Milbourne| title=Houdini: The Untold Story| url=https://archive.org/details/houdiniuntoldsto00chri| url-access=registration| date=1969| isbn=978-0891909811| page=[https://archive.org/details/houdiniuntoldsto00chri/page/140 140]| publisher=Ty Crowell Co.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/01/digging-into-buried-alive.html |title=Digging into Houdini's Buried Alive |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\nHoudini's second variation on buried alive was an endurance test designed to expose mystical Egyptian performer Rahman Bey, who had claimed to use supernatural powers to remain in a sealed casket for an hour. Houdini bettered Bey on August 5, 1926, by remaining in a sealed casket, or coffin, submerged in the swimming pool of New York's Hotel Shelton for one and a half hours. Houdini claimed he did not use any trickery or supernatural powers to accomplish this feat, just controlled breathing.<ref>Silverman, pp.&nbsp;397\u2013403.</ref> He repeated the feat at the YMCA in Worcester, Massachusetts on September 28, 1926, this time remaining sealed for one hour and eleven minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/01/uncovering-houdinis-forgotten-second.html |title=Uncovering Houdini's second underwater test |accessdate=January 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nHoudini's final buried alive was an elaborate stage escape that featured in his full evening show. Houdini would escape after being strapped in a straitjacket, sealed in a casket, and then buried in a large tank filled with sand. While posters advertising the escape exist (playing off the Bey challenge by boasting \"Egyptian Fakirs Outdone!\"), it is unclear whether Houdini ever performed buried alive on stage. The stunt was to be the feature escape of his 1927 season, but Houdini died on October 31, 1926. The bronze casket Houdini created for buried alive was used to transport Houdini's body from Detroit to New York following his death on [[Halloween]].<ref>Silverman, p. 406.</ref>\n\n==Movie career==\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 200\n | image1    = Mastermystery-1919poster.jpg\n | alt1      = ''The Houdini Serial'', 1919 movie poster\n | caption1  = ''The Houdini Serial'', 1919 movie poster\n | image2    = Grim game.jpg\n | alt2      = ''[[The Grim Game]]'', 1919 movie poster\n | caption2  = ''The Grim Game'', 1919 movie poster\n}}\n[[File:The Master Mystery (trailer) - Burton King - 1919, B.A. Rolfe Photoplays - EYE FLM41533 - OB 685697.webm|thumb|Silent movie ''The Master Mystery'' (1919).

That same year Houdini got an offer to star as [[Captain Nemo]] in a silent version of ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'', but the project never made it into production.<ref>Silverman, p. 205.</ref>\nIt is often erroneously reported that Houdini served as special-effects consultant on the Wharton/International cliffhanger serial, ''The Mysteries of Myra'', shot in Ithaca, New York, because Harry Grossman, director of ''The Master Mystery'' also filmed a serial in Ithaca at about the same time. The consultants on the serial were pioneering [[Hereward Carrington]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stedman |first1=Eric |title=The Mysteries of Myra |year=2010 |page=8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1918, Houdini signed a contract with film producer [[B. A. Rolfe]] to star in a 15-part [[serial (film)|serial]], ''[[The Master Mystery]]'' (released in November 1918). As was common at the time, the film serial was released simultaneously with a novel. Financial difficulties resulted in [[Rolfe Photoplays Inc.|B. A. Rolfe Productions]] going out of business, but ''The Master Mystery'' led to Houdini being signed by [[Famous Players-Lasky Corporation]]/[[Paramount Pictures]], for whom he made two pictures, ''The Grim Game'' (1919) and ''[[Terror Island]]'' (1920).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/12/adroit-harry-and-ancient-hokum.html |title=Adroit Harry and ancient hokum |accessdate=December 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Grim Game]]'' was Houdini's first full-length movie and is reputed to be his best. Because of the flammable nature of nitrate film and the inherent chemical instability of the [[Safety film#Decay and the .22vinegar syndrome.22|acetate \"safety\" film]] that supplanted it, only 10 percent of old silent movies exist. Film historians considered the film lost. One copy did exist hidden in the collection of a private collector only known to a tiny group of magicians that saw it. Dick Brookz and Dorothy Dietrich of The Houdini Museum in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]] had seen it twice on the invitation of the collector.

Publicity was geared heavily toward promoting this dramatic \"caught on film\" moment, claiming it was Houdini himself dangling from the plane. While filming these movies in Los Angeles, Houdini rented a home in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Laurel Canyon]]. Following his two-picture stint in Hollywood, Houdini returned to New York and started his own film production company called the \"Houdini Picture Corporation\". He produced and starred in two films, ''[[The Man from Beyond]]'' (1921) and ''[[Haldane of the Secret Service]]'' (1923). He also founded his own film laboratory business called The Film Development Corporation (FDC), gambling on a new process for developing motion picture film. Houdini's brother, [[Theodore Hardeen]], left his own career as a magician and escape artist to run the company. Magician [[Harry Kellar]] was a major investor.<ref>Silverman, pp. 226\u2013249.</ref>\n\nNeither Houdini's acting career nor FDC found success, and he gave up on the movie business in 1923, complaining that \"the profits are too meager\".\n\nIn April 2008, Kino International released a DVD box set of Houdini's surviving silent films, including ''The Master Mystery'', ''Terror Island'', ''The Man From Beyond'', ''Haldane of the Secret Service'', and five minutes from ''The Grim Game''.

Doyle came to believe that Houdini was a powerful spiritualist medium, and had performed many of his stunts by means of paranormal abilities and was using these abilities to block those of other mediums that he was \"debunking\".<ref>see Conan Doyle's ''The Edge of The Unknown'', published in 1931.</ref> This disagreement led to the two men becoming public antagonists, and Sir Arthur came to view Houdini as a dangerous enemy.<ref name=\"secret\"/>\n\nBefore Houdini died, he and his wife agreed that if Houdini found it possible to communicate after death, he would communicate the message \"Rosabelle believe\", a secret code which they agreed to use. Rosabelle was their favorite song. Bess held yearly [[Seances|s\u00e9ances]] on [[Halloween]] for ten years after Houdini's death. She did claim to have contact through [[Arthur Ford (psychic)|Arthur Ford]] in 1929 when Ford conveyed the secret code, but Bess later said the incident had been faked. The code seems to have been such that it could be broken by Ford or his associates using existing clues.<ref name=\"secret\"/> Evidence to this effect was discovered by Ford's biographer after he died in 1971.<ref>{{cite book| first1=Allen| last1=Spragget| first2= William V.| last2=Rauscher| title=Arthur Ford: The Man Who Talked with the Dead| year=1974| publisher=[[New American Library]]| page=246}}</ref> In 1936, after a last unsuccessful s\u00e9ance on the roof of the [[Knickerbocker Hotel (Los Angeles)|Knickerbocker Hotel]], she put out the candle that she had kept burning beside a photograph of Houdini since his death.

It communicated to audiences at once warm amiability, pleasure in performing, and, more subtly, imperious self-assurance. Several reporters tried to capture the charming effect, describing him as \"happy-looking\", \"pleasant-faced\", \"good natured at all times\", \"the young Hungarian magician with the pleasant smile and easy confidence\".<ref>Silverman, p. 31.</ref>}}\n\n{{Listen\n| filename    = Harry Houdini's voice.ogg\n| title       = Harry Houdini's voice\n| description = Recording of Harry Houdini's voice made on October 29, 1914\n}}\nHoudini made the only known recordings of his voice on Edison [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinder]]s on October 29, 1914, in [[Flatbush, New York]].

He then delivered \"some very hammer-like blows below the belt\". Houdini was reclining on a couch at the time, having broken his ankle while performing several days earlier. Price said that Houdini winced at each blow and stopped Whitehead suddenly in the midst of a punch, gesturing that he had had enough, and adding that he had had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not expect Whitehead to strike him so suddenly and forcefully.

The third story, \"[[Imprisoned with the Pharaohs]],\" was written by horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]] based on Houdini's notes. The Houdini-Lovecraft collaboration was envisioned to continue, but the magazine ceased publication for financial reasons.

Expansion of the settlement was facilitated after 1888 when the [[Midland Railway]] opened [[Staple Hill railway station]], giving direct access to Bristol and Gloucester, and also to Bath by the [[Mangotsfield and Bath branch line]].  The Bath line of the Midland Railway involved the construction of a beautifully engineered tunnel deep under the hill at Staple Hill. After this investment, Staple Hill grew beyond a small hamlet and gained tram and bus links with Bristol that allowed it to become a residence for commuters to Bristol or Bath.  The station closed in 1966.\n\n[[Image:Jane Omorogbe Quasar.jpg|thumb|left|Broadcaster [[Jane Omorogbe]] in a Quasar]]\nIn the 20th century, Staple Hill benefited from the construction of Bristol's ring-road and the M4 and M5 motorways.

Expansion of the settlement was facilitated after 1888 when the [[Midland Railway]] opened [[Staple Hill railway station]], giving direct access to Bristol and Gloucester, and also to Bath by the [[Mangotsfield and Bath branch line]].  The Bath line of the Midland Railway involved the construction of a beautifully engineered tunnel deep under the hill at Staple Hill. After this investment, Staple Hill grew beyond a small hamlet and gained tram and bus links with Bristol that allowed it to become a residence for commuters to Bristol or Bath.  The station closed in 1966.\n\n[[Image:Jane Omorogbe Quasar.jpg|thumb|left|Broadcaster [[Jane Omorogbe]] in a Quasar]]\nIn the 20th century, Staple Hill benefited from the construction of Bristol's ring-road and the M4 and M5 motorways.

It made aviation records, became [[List of most-produced aircraft|the most-produced supersonic jet aircraft in aviation history]], the most-produced combat aircraft since the [[Korean War]] and previously the longest production run of a combat aircraft (now exceeded by both the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]]).\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nThe MiG-21 jet fighter was a continuation of Soviet jet fighters, starting with the subsonic [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]], and the supersonic [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]]. A number of experimental Mach 2 Soviet designs were based on nose intakes with either swept-back wings, such as the [[Sukhoi Su-7]], or tailed [[delta wing|deltas]], of which the MiG-21 would be the most successful.\n\nDevelopment of what would become the MiG-21 began in the early 1950s, when Mikoyan OKB finished a preliminary design study for a [[prototype]] designated Ye-1 in 1954. This project was very quickly reworked when it was determined that the planned engine was underpowered; the redesign led to the second prototype, the Ye-2. Both these and other early prototypes featured swept wings. The first prototype with [[delta wings]] as found on production variants was the Ye-4. It made its maiden flight on 16 June 1955 and its first public appearance during the [[Soviet Aviation Day|Soviet Aviation Day display]] at Moscow's [[Tushino airfield]] in July 1956.\n\nIn the West, due to the lack of available information, early details of the MiG-21 often were confused with those of similar Soviet fighters of the era. In one instance, ''Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1960\u20131961'' listed the \"Fishbed\" as a [[Sukhoi Design Bureau|Sukhoi design]] and used an illustration of the [[Sukhoi Su-9|Su-9 'Fishpot']].\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21bis, Hungary - Air Force AN0740836.jpg|thumb|[[Hungarian Air Force]] MiG-21bis on takeoff.]]\n[[File:Mig-21.jpg|thumb|MiG-21 at Aleksotas Airport (S. Dariaus / S. Gireno), Kaunas (EYKS)]]\n[[File:MiG-21M Preschen (22951457305).jpg|thumb|MiG-21\u041c National People's Army of the GDR, August 1990]]\nThe MiG-21 was the first successful Soviet aircraft combining [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] and [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] characteristics in a single aircraft. It was a lightweight fighter, achieving Mach 2 with a relatively low-powered [[afterburner (engine)|afterburning]] [[turbojet]], and is thus comparable to the American [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] and [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter]] and the French [[Dassault Mirage III]].<ref name=\"Gordon 2008\" /> Its basic layout was used for numerous other Soviet designs; delta-winged aircraft included [[Sukhoi Su-9|Su-9]] interceptor and the fast [[Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-150 family|E-150]] prototype from MiG bureau while the mass-produced successful front fighter [[Sukhoi Su-7|Su-7]] and Mikoyan's [[Mikoyan-Gurevich I-75|I-75]] experimental interceptor combined a similar fuselage shape with swept-back wings. However, the characteristic layout with the shock cone and front air intake did not see widespread use outside the USSR and finally proved to have limited development potential, mainly because of the very small space available for the radar.\n\nLike many aircraft designed as interceptors, the MiG-21 had a short range. This was exacerbated by the poor placement of the internal fuel tanks ahead of the centre of gravity. As the internal fuel was consumed, the center of gravity would shift rearward beyond acceptable parameters. This had the effect of making the plane [[Longitudinal static stability|statically unstable]] to the point of being difficult to control, resulting in an endurance of only 45 minutes in clean condition. This can be somewhat countered by carrying fuel in external tanks closer to the center of gravity. The Chinese variants somewhat improved the internal fuel tank layout (also second generation of Soviet variants), and also carry significantly larger external fuel tanks to counter this issue.<ref>Civil Airworthiness Certification: Former Military High-Performance Aircraft, United States Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration.</ref> Additionally, when more than half the fuel was used up, violent maneuvers prevented fuel from flowing into the engine{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}, thereby causing it to shut down in flight. This increased the risk of tank implosions (MiG-21 had tanks pressurized with air from the engine's compressor), a problem inherited from the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]].<ref name=\"J F Dunnigan\">Dunnigan, James F.

However, the light loading of the aircraft could mean that a [[climb rate]] of 235&nbsp;m/s (46,250&nbsp;ft/min) was possible with a combat-loaded MiG-21bis,<ref name=\"Gordon 2008\" /> not far short of the performance of the later [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16A]].

The limit of operation is 1 minute for dogfight practice and 3 minutes for an actual wartime emergency, as further use causes the engine to overheat.  Use of this \"diamond regime\" provided a massive 97.4&nbsp;kN of thrust for no more than 3 minutes in actual wartime use. Use of this temporary power gave the MiG-21bis slightly better than 1:1 thrust-to-weight ratio and a climbing rate of 254 meters/second, equalling the F-16's nominal capabilities in close-quarters dogfight.\nIn air combat practice with the MiG-21bis, use of WEP thrust was limited to 1 minute, to spare on the engines' 800 flight hours lifetime, since every second of super-afterburner use counted as several minutes of regular power run due to extreme thermal stress.

However, not until the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29|MiG-29]] would the Soviet Union ultimately replace the MiG-21 as a maneuvering dogfighter to counter new American air superiority types.\n\nThe MiG-21 was exported widely and remains in use. The aircraft's simple controls, engine, weapons, and avionics were typical of Soviet-era military designs. The use of a tail with the delta wing aids stability and control at the extremes of the [[flight envelope]], enhancing safety for lower-skilled pilots; this in turn enhanced its marketability in exports to developing countries with limited training programs and restricted pilot pools. While technologically inferior to the more advanced fighters it often faced, low production and maintenance costs made it a favorite of nations buying [[Eastern Bloc]] military hardware. Several Russian, Israeli and Romanian firms have begun to offer upgrade packages to MiG-21 operators, designed to bring the aircraft up to a modern standard, with greatly upgraded avionics and armaments.<ref name=\"Gordon 2008\" />\n\n===Production===\n[[File:MiG-21F-13 Fishbed C.JPG|thumb|Czechoslovak MiG-21F-13 \"Fishbed C\"]]\nA total of 10,645 aircraft were built in the USSR.

The [[sweep angle]] on the [[leading edge]] is 57\u00b0 with a [[TsAGI]] S-12 [[airfoil]]. The [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]] is 0\u00b0 while the [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral angle]] is \u22122\u00b0. On the [[trailing edge]] there are [[ailerons]] with an area of 1.18&nbsp;m\u00b2, and [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] with an area of 1.87&nbsp;m\u00b2. In front of the ailerons there are small [[wing fence]]s.\n\nThe fuselage is [[semi-monocoque]] with an elliptical profile and a maximum width of {{convert|1.24|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The air flow to the engine is regulated by an [[inlet cone]] in the air intake. On early model MiG-21s, the cone has three positions. For speeds up to Mach 1.5 the cone is fully retracted to the maximum aft position. For speeds between Mach 1.5 and Mach 1.9 the cone moves to the middle position. For speeds higher than Mach 1.9 the cone moves to the maximum forward position. On the later model MiG-21PF, the intake cone moves to a position based on the actual speed. The cone position for a given speed is calculated by the UVD-2M system using air pressures from in front and behind the [[Gas compressor|compressor]] of the engine. On both sides of the nose there are gills to supply the engine with more air while on the ground and during takeoff. In the first variant of the MiG-21, the [[pitot tube]] is attached to the bottom of the nose. After the MiG-21P variant, this tube is attached to the top of the air intake. Later versions shifted the pitot tube attachment point 15 degrees to the right, as seen from the cockpit and had an emergency pitot head on the right side, just ahead of the canopy and below the pilot's eyeline.\n\nThe cabin is pressurized and air conditioned. On variants prior to the MiG-21PFM, the cabin canopy is hinged at the front. When ejecting, the SK-1 ejection seat connects with the canopy to make a capsule that encloses the pilot. The capsule protects the pilot from the high-speed airflow encountered during high-speed ejections. After ejection, the capsule opens to allow the pilot to parachute to the ground. However, ejecting at low altitudes can cause the canopy to take too long to separate, sometimes resulting in pilot death. The minimum height for ejection '''in level flight''' was 110&nbsp;m. Starting from the MiG-21PFM, the canopy is hinged on the right side of the cockpit.\n\nOn the under side of the aircraft there are three air brakes, two at the front and one at the rear. The front air brakes have an area of 0.76&nbsp;m\u00b2, and a deflection angle of 35\u00b0. The rear air brake has an area of 0.46&nbsp;m\u00b2 and a deflection angle of 40\u00b0. The rear air brake is blocked if the airplane carries an external fuel tank. Behind the air brakes are the bays for the main landing gear. On the under side of the airplane, just behind the trailing edge of the wing are attachment points for two [[JATO]] rockets. The front section of the fuselage ends at [[former]] #28. The rear section of the fuselage starts at former #28a and is removable for engine maintenance.\n\nThe [[empennage]] of the MiG-21 consists of a [[vertical stabilizer]], a [[stabilator]] and a small fin on the bottom of the tail to improve yaw control. The vertical stabilizer has a sweep angle of 60\u00b0 and an area of 5.32&nbsp;m\u00b2 (on earlier version 3.8&nbsp;m\u00b2) and a [[rudder]]. The stabilator has a sweep angle of 57\u00b0, an area of 3.94&nbsp;m\u00b2 and a span of 2.6&nbsp;m.\n\nThe MiG-21 uses a [[tricycle]] type undercarriage. On most variants the main landing gear uses tires that are 800&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm in width. Only the MiG-21F variants use tires with the size 660\u00d7200&nbsp;mm. The wheels of the main landing gear retract into the fuselage after rotating 87\u00b0 and the shock absorbers retract into the wing. The nose gear retracts forward into the fuselage under the radar. The nose wheel can be lowered manually by simply unlocking its hatch from inside the cockpit. Thus, landing with undercarriage locked in the up position due to an internal failure was not a major issue, with a number of such successful landings on the nosewheel and ventral fuel tank or the airbrake.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===India===\n\n====Overview====\n[[File:Back of a MiG-21.JPG|thumb|MiG-21F-13 rear view]]\n[[File:Sheeju mig21.JPG|thumb|right|A MiG-21 Bison of the [[Indian Air Force]]]]\nIndia is the largest operator of MiG-21s.

It made aviation records, became [[List of most-produced aircraft|the most-produced supersonic jet aircraft in aviation history]], the most-produced combat aircraft since the [[Korean War]] and previously the longest production run of a combat aircraft (now exceeded by both the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle]] and [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon]]).\n\n==Development==\n\n===Origins===\nThe MiG-21 jet fighter was a continuation of Soviet jet fighters, starting with the subsonic [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]], and the supersonic [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]]. A number of experimental Mach 2 Soviet designs were based on nose intakes with either swept-back wings, such as the [[Sukhoi Su-7]], or tailed [[delta wing|deltas]], of which the MiG-21 would be the most successful.\n\nDevelopment of what would become the MiG-21 began in the early 1950s, when Mikoyan OKB finished a preliminary design study for a [[prototype]] designated Ye-1 in 1954. This project was very quickly reworked when it was determined that the planned engine was underpowered; the redesign led to the second prototype, the Ye-2. Both these and other early prototypes featured swept wings. The first prototype with [[delta wings]] as found on production variants was the Ye-4. It made its maiden flight on 16 June 1955 and its first public appearance during the [[Soviet Aviation Day|Soviet Aviation Day display]] at Moscow's [[Tushino airfield]] in July 1956.\n\nIn the West, due to the lack of available information, early details of the MiG-21 often were confused with those of similar Soviet fighters of the era. In one instance, ''Jane's All the World's Aircraft 1960\u20131961'' listed the \"Fishbed\" as a [[Sukhoi Design Bureau|Sukhoi design]] and used an illustration of the [[Sukhoi Su-9|Su-9 'Fishpot']].\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21bis, Hungary - Air Force AN0740836.jpg|thumb|[[Hungarian Air Force]] MiG-21bis on takeoff.]]\n[[File:Mig-21.jpg|thumb|MiG-21 at Aleksotas Airport (S. Dariaus / S. Gireno), Kaunas (EYKS)]]\n[[File:MiG-21M Preschen (22951457305).jpg|thumb|MiG-21\u041c National People's Army of the GDR, August 1990]]\nThe MiG-21 was the first successful Soviet aircraft combining [[fighter aircraft|fighter]] and [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] characteristics in a single aircraft. It was a lightweight fighter, achieving Mach 2 with a relatively low-powered [[afterburner (engine)|afterburning]] [[turbojet]], and is thus comparable to the American [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] and [[Northrop F-5|Northrop F-5 Freedom Fighter]] and the French [[Dassault Mirage III]].<ref name=\"Gordon 2008\" /> Its basic layout was used for numerous other Soviet designs; delta-winged aircraft included [[Sukhoi Su-9|Su-9]] interceptor and the fast [[Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-150 family|E-150]] prototype from MiG bureau while the mass-produced successful front fighter [[Sukhoi Su-7|Su-7]] and Mikoyan's [[Mikoyan-Gurevich I-75|I-75]] experimental interceptor combined a similar fuselage shape with swept-back wings. However, the characteristic layout with the shock cone and front air intake did not see widespread use outside the USSR and finally proved to have limited development potential, mainly because of the very small space available for the radar.\n\nLike many aircraft designed as interceptors, the MiG-21 had a short range. This was exacerbated by the poor placement of the internal fuel tanks ahead of the centre of gravity. As the internal fuel was consumed, the center of gravity would shift rearward beyond acceptable parameters. This had the effect of making the plane [[Longitudinal static stability|statically unstable]] to the point of being difficult to control, resulting in an endurance of only 45 minutes in clean condition. This can be somewhat countered by carrying fuel in external tanks closer to the center of gravity. The Chinese variants somewhat improved the internal fuel tank layout (also second generation of Soviet variants), and also carry significantly larger external fuel tanks to counter this issue.<ref>Civil Airworthiness Certification: Former Military High-Performance Aircraft, United States Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration.</ref> Additionally, when more than half the fuel was used up, violent maneuvers prevented fuel from flowing into the engine{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}, thereby causing it to shut down in flight. This increased the risk of tank implosions (MiG-21 had tanks pressurized with air from the engine's compressor), a problem inherited from the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17]] and [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-19|MiG-19]].<ref name=\"J F Dunnigan\">Dunnigan, James F.

However, the light loading of the aircraft could mean that a [[climb rate]] of 235&nbsp;m/s (46,250&nbsp;ft/min) was possible with a combat-loaded MiG-21bis,<ref name=\"Gordon 2008\" /> not far short of the performance of the later [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16A]].

The limit of operation is 1 minute for dogfight practice and 3 minutes for an actual wartime emergency, as further use causes the engine to overheat.  Use of this \"diamond regime\" provided a massive 97.4&nbsp;kN of thrust for no more than 3 minutes in actual wartime use. Use of this temporary power gave the MiG-21bis slightly better than 1:1 thrust-to-weight ratio and a climbing rate of 254 meters/second, equalling the F-16's nominal capabilities in close-quarters dogfight.\nIn air combat practice with the MiG-21bis, use of WEP thrust was limited to 1 minute, to spare on the engines' 800 flight hours lifetime, since every second of super-afterburner use counted as several minutes of regular power run due to extreme thermal stress. When WEP was on, the MiG-21bis's R-25 engine produced a huge 5 meter long blowtorch exhaust - the six or seven brightly glowing rhomboid \"shock diamonds\" visible inside the flames gave the emergency-power setting its \"diamond regime\" name.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=125066 |title = Afterburner/Engine simulation question - ED Forums}}</ref> Given a skilled pilot and capable missiles, it could give a good account of itself against contemporary fighters.

However, not until the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29|MiG-29]] would the Soviet Union ultimately replace the MiG-21 as a maneuvering dogfighter to counter new American air superiority types.\n\nThe MiG-21 was exported widely and remains in use. The aircraft's simple controls, engine, weapons, and avionics were typical of Soviet-era military designs. The use of a tail with the delta wing aids stability and control at the extremes of the [[flight envelope]], enhancing safety for lower-skilled pilots; this in turn enhanced its marketability in exports to developing countries with limited training programs and restricted pilot pools. While technologically inferior to the more advanced fighters it often faced, low production and maintenance costs made it a favorite of nations buying [[Eastern Bloc]] military hardware.

The [[sweep angle]] on the [[leading edge]] is 57\u00b0 with a [[TsAGI]] S-12 [[airfoil]]. The [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle of incidence]] is 0\u00b0 while the [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral angle]] is \u22122\u00b0. On the [[trailing edge]] there are [[ailerons]] with an area of 1.18&nbsp;m\u00b2, and [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] with an area of 1.87&nbsp;m\u00b2. In front of the ailerons there are small [[wing fence]]s.\n\nThe fuselage is [[semi-monocoque]] with an elliptical profile and a maximum width of {{convert|1.24|m|ftin|abbr=on}}. The air flow to the engine is regulated by an [[inlet cone]] in the air intake. On early model MiG-21s, the cone has three positions. For speeds up to Mach 1.5 the cone is fully retracted to the maximum aft position. For speeds between Mach 1.5 and Mach 1.9 the cone moves to the middle position. For speeds higher than Mach 1.9 the cone moves to the maximum forward position. On the later model MiG-21PF, the intake cone moves to a position based on the actual speed. The cone position for a given speed is calculated by the UVD-2M system using air pressures from in front and behind the [[Gas compressor|compressor]] of the engine. On both sides of the nose there are gills to supply the engine with more air while on the ground and during takeoff. In the first variant of the MiG-21, the [[pitot tube]] is attached to the bottom of the nose. After the MiG-21P variant, this tube is attached to the top of the air intake. Later versions shifted the pitot tube attachment point 15 degrees to the right, as seen from the cockpit and had an emergency pitot head on the right side, just ahead of the canopy and below the pilot's eyeline.\n\nThe cabin is pressurized and air conditioned. On variants prior to the MiG-21PFM, the cabin canopy is hinged at the front. When ejecting, the SK-1 ejection seat connects with the canopy to make a capsule that encloses the pilot. The capsule protects the pilot from the high-speed airflow encountered during high-speed ejections. After ejection, the capsule opens to allow the pilot to parachute to the ground. However, ejecting at low altitudes can cause the canopy to take too long to separate, sometimes resulting in pilot death. The minimum height for ejection '''in level flight''' was 110&nbsp;m. Starting from the MiG-21PFM, the canopy is hinged on the right side of the cockpit.\n\nOn the under side of the aircraft there are three air brakes, two at the front and one at the rear. The front air brakes have an area of 0.76&nbsp;m\u00b2, and a deflection angle of 35\u00b0. The rear air brake has an area of 0.46&nbsp;m\u00b2 and a deflection angle of 40\u00b0. The rear air brake is blocked if the airplane carries an external fuel tank. Behind the air brakes are the bays for the main landing gear. On the under side of the airplane, just behind the trailing edge of the wing are attachment points for two [[JATO]] rockets. The front section of the fuselage ends at [[former]] #28. The rear section of the fuselage starts at former #28a and is removable for engine maintenance.\n\nThe [[empennage]] of the MiG-21 consists of a [[vertical stabilizer]], a [[stabilator]] and a small fin on the bottom of the tail to improve yaw control. The vertical stabilizer has a sweep angle of 60\u00b0 and an area of 5.32&nbsp;m\u00b2 (on earlier version 3.8&nbsp;m\u00b2) and a [[rudder]]. The stabilator has a sweep angle of 57\u00b0, an area of 3.94&nbsp;m\u00b2 and a span of 2.6&nbsp;m.\n\nThe MiG-21 uses a [[tricycle]] type undercarriage. On most variants the main landing gear uses tires that are 800&nbsp;mm in diameter and 200&nbsp;mm in width. Only the MiG-21F variants use tires with the size 660\u00d7200&nbsp;mm. The wheels of the main landing gear retract into the fuselage after rotating 87\u00b0 and the shock absorbers retract into the wing. The nose gear retracts forward into the fuselage under the radar. The nose wheel can be lowered manually by simply unlocking its hatch from inside the cockpit. Thus, landing with undercarriage locked in the up position due to an internal failure was not a major issue, with a number of such successful landings on the nosewheel and ventral fuel tank or the airbrake.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===India===\n\n====Overview====\n[[File:Back of a MiG-21.JPG|thumb|MiG-21F-13 rear view]]\n[[File:Sheeju mig21.JPG|thumb|right|A MiG-21 Bison of the [[Indian Air Force]]]]\nIndia is the largest operator of MiG-21s.
