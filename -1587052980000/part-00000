Davido said the allegations against him were false but apologized to [[Dele Momodu]], the cousin of the girl's mother.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kehinde Ajose|title=Davido vs baby-mama drama: Davido apologises to Dele Momodu|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/davido-vs-baby-mama-drama-davido-apologises-to-dele-momodu/|work=Vanguard|accessdate=January 1, 2016|date=December 31, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231201021/http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/davido-vs-baby-mama-drama-davido-apologises-to-dele-momodu/|archive-date=December 31, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Davido takes baby mama drama to new heights|url=http://www.punchng.com/davido-takes-baby-mama-drama-to-new-heights/|publisher=Punch|accessdate=January 1, 2016|date=January 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101011621/http://www.punchng.com/davido-takes-baby-mama-drama-to-new-heights/#|archivedate=January 1, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums and EPs===\n* ''[[Omo Baba Olowo]]'' (2012)\n* ''[[Son of Mercy]]'' (2016)\n* ''[[A Good Time]]'' (2019)\n\n===Singles (partial)===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Title\n!Album\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2011\n|\"Back When\" <span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\">(featuring [[Naeto C]])</span>\n|rowspan=\"7\"|''Omo Baba Olowo''\n|-\n|\"[[Dami Duro]]\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"5\"|2012\n|\"Ekuro\"\n|-\n|\"Overseas\"<span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\"> (featuring Sina Rambo)</span>\n|-\n|\"Gbon Gbon\"\n|-\n|\"All of You\"\n|-\n|\"Feel Alright\" <span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\">(featuring [[Ice Prince]])</span>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2013\n|\"One of a Kind\"\n|rowspan=\"10\"{{n/a|Non-album single}}\n|-\n|\"[[Gobe (song)|Gobe]]\" \n|-\n|\"[[Skelewu]]\"\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2014\n|\"[[Aye (song)|Aye]]\"\n|-\n|\"Tchelete (Goodlife)\"<span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\"> (featuring [[Mafikizolo]])</span>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\"|2015\n|\"Dodo\"\n|-\n|\"Fans Mi\" <span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\"> (featuring [[Meek Mill]])</span>\n|-\n|\"Owo Ni Koko\"\n|-\n|\"The Sound\"<span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\"> (featuring Uhuru and DJ Buckz)</span>\n|-\n|\"The Money\" <span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\">(featuring [[Olamide]])</span>\n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"|2016\n|\"Gbagbe Oshi\"\n|rowspan=\"3\"|''Son of Mercy''\n|-\n|\"How Long\" <span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\">(featuring [[Tinashe]])</span>\n|-\n|\"Coolest Kid in Africa\" <span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\">(featuring [[Nasty C]])</span>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"5\" |2017\n|\"If\"\n|rowspan=\"2\"|''[[A Good Time]]''\n|-\n|\"[[Fall (Davido song)|Fall]]\"\n|-\n|\"Pere\" <span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\">(featuring [[Rae Sremmurd]] and [[Young Thug]])</span>\n|rowspan=\"4\" {{n/a|Non-album single}}\n|-\n|\"Fia\"\n|-\n|\"Like Dat\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |2018\n|\"Flora My Flawa\"\n|-\n|\"Assurance\"\n|''A Good Time''\n|-\n|\"Nwa Baby\"\n|rowspan=\"2\" {{n/a|Non-album single}}\n|-\n|\"Wonder Woman\"\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |2019\n|\"Blow My Mind\" <span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\">(featuring [[Chris Brown]])</span>\n|rowspan=\"2\"|''A Good Time''\n|-\n|\"Risky\" <span style=\"font-size:85%; <!--font-weight:normal;-->\">(featuring [[Popcaan]])</span>\n|-\n|}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of awards and nominations received by Davido]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Davido}}\n*{{Official website|https://www.iamdavido.com/}} \n{{S-start}}\n{{s-ach}}\n{{succession box|title=[[The Headies award for Next Rated|Next Rated Award]]|before=[[Wizkid (musician)|Wizkid]] ([[The Headies 2011|2011]])|after=[[Sean Tizzle]] ([[The Headies 2013|2013]])|years=[[The Headies 2012|2012]]}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{Portal bar|Africa|Biography|Music|Nigeria}}\n{{Davido|state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1992 births]]\n[[Category:21st-century Nigerian musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Atlanta]]\n[[Category:American people of Nigerian descent]]\n[[Category:American people of Yoruba descent]]\n[[Category:Nigerian male singers]]\n[[Category:Nigerian singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Yoruba musicians]]\n[[Category:Nigerian record producers]]\n[[Category:The Headies winners]]\n[[Category:21st-century American musicians]]\n[[Category:Oakwood University alumni]]\n[[Category:Yoruba-language singers]]\n[[Category:Babcock University alumni]]\n[[Category:RCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:Nigerian male pop singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century Nigerian singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century male singers]]\n[[Category:Adeleke family]]\n", "name_user": "Engrhaydot", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Post websites davido track can be downloaded)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davido"}

Her parents were activists in the abolitionist and suffragist movements. She was also a descendant of [[John Alden]] and [[Priscilla Alden]], who sailed to America on the ''[[Mayflower]]'', and a cousin of John and John Q. Adams. Pitts graduated from [[Mount Holyoke College]] (then called the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary) in 1859. After the U.S. Civil War, she taught at the [[Hampton Institute]]. In 1880, Helen moved to [[Anacostia|Uniontown]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and lived next door to Douglass' home, Cedar Hill.\n\n==Career==\n\n===Activism===\nShe was active in the [[First-wave feminism|women's rights movement]] and co-edited ''The Alpha'', with [[Caroline Winslow]], in Washington. In 1882, Douglass hired Helen as a clerk in the office of the Recorder of Deeds in Washington, to which he had just been assigned.

The children declined, insisting that the estate be sold and the money divided among all the heirs.\n\nWith borrowed money, Helen bought the property, and then devoted the rest of her life to planning and establishing the Frederick Douglass Memorial and Historical Association. Besides effecting passage of the law incorporating the association, she worked to raise funds to maintain the estate. For eight years, she lectured throughout the northeast.\n\nDuring the last year of her life, Helen was ill and unable to lecture, as well as discouraged by the falling off of contributions for her cause. She begged the Rev. Francis Grimke not to let her work fall by the wayside in her absence. He suggested that if the mortgage on Cedar Hill should not be paid off in her lifetime, money from the sale of the property should go to two college scholarships in her and Frederick's names. She agreed, on the condition that the scholarships be in Douglass' name only.\n\nAfter her death, the $5,500 mortgage was reduced to $4,000, and the [[National Association of Colored Women]], led by [[Mary B.

The first two incarnations, Oswin Oswald and Clara Oswin Oswald, each die during the episode in which they appear. The third incarnation becomes the Doctor's companion, travelling with him for the remainder of the series as he tries to uncover the mystery of her multiple lives.

First appearing in the show's [[Doctor Who (series 7)|seventh series]], Clara served as a companion of the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[time travel in fiction|time traveller]] known as [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in his [[Eleventh Doctor|eleventh]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) and [[Twelfth Doctor|twelfth]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) incarnations. She remains the longest serving companion since the show's revival in 2005.\n\nClara is initially presented to the audience during the seventh series as three distinct, though similarly named, people living in different eras. The first two incarnations, Oswin Oswald and Clara Oswin Oswald, each die during the episode in which they appear. The third incarnation becomes the Doctor's companion, travelling with him for the remainder of the series as he tries to uncover the mystery of her multiple lives. She continues to travel with the Doctor after the mystery is resolved at the end of the series, witnessing him regenerate into his twelfth incarnation in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\" (2013). The pair have various adventures together in the [[Doctor Who (series 8)|eighth]] and [[Doctor Who (series 9)|ninth series]] until she departs the show in \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\" (2015). She reappears briefly in the Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon A Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" (2017).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nOswin Oswald is introduced in the [[Doctor Who (series 7)|series 7]] premiere, \"[[Asylum of the Daleks]]\" (2012). She is the sole survivor of the [[starship]] ''Alaska'', which crashed on the Asylum, a prison planet for insane [[Dalek]]s. Oswin then learns from the [[Eleventh Doctor]] (Matt Smith) that she has been converted from human into a Dalek and has coped by retreating into a fantasy of her own intact survival. She assists the Doctor and his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|travelling companions]], [[Amy Pond]] ([[Karen Gillan]]) and [[Rory Williams]] ([[Arthur Darvill]]), to escape the planet unharmed, but at the cost of her own life.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Asylum of the Daleks |episode-link=Asylum of the Daleks |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Steven (writer) |last=Moffat |author-link=Steven Moffat |first2=Nick (director) |last2=Hurran |author-link2=Nick Hurran |first3=Marcus (producer) |last3=Wilson |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=1 September 2012 |season= |series-no=7 |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Later, in the 2012 Christmas special \"[[The Snowmen]]\", the Doctor meets a woman named Clara Oswin Oswald, whom he initially knows only as Clara.

The service delivers software updates for Windows, as well as the various Microsoft [[Antivirus software|antivirus products]], including [[Windows Defender]] and [[Microsoft Security Essentials]]. Since its inception, Microsoft has introduced two extensions of the service: '''Microsoft Update''' and '''Windows Update for Business'''. The former expands the core service to include other Microsoft products, such as [[Microsoft Office]] and [[Microsoft Expression Studio]]. The latter is available to business editions of [[Windows 10]] and permits postponing updates or receiving updates only after they have undergone rigorous testing.\n\nAs the service has evolved over the years, so have its client software. For a decade, the primary client component of the service was the Windows Update [[web app]] that could only be run inside [[Internet Explorer]]. Starting with [[Windows Vista]], the primary client component became Windows Update Agent, an integral component of the operating system.\n\nThe service provides several kinds of updates. ''Security updates'' or ''critical updates'' mitigate vulnerabilities against [[exploit (computer security)|security exploits]] against Microsoft Windows. ''Cumulative updates'' are updates that bundle multiple updates, both new and previously released updates. Cumulative updates were introduced with [[Windows 10]] and have been backported to [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows 8.1]].\n\nMicrosoft routinely releases updates on the second Tuesday of each month (known as the [[Patch Tuesday]]), but can provide them whenever a new update is urgently required to prevent a newly discovered or prevalent exploit. System administrators can configure Windows Update to install critical updates for Microsoft Windows automatically, so long as the computer has an Internet connection.\n\n==Clients==\n===Windows Update web app===\n[[File:Win Update ME.png|thumb|left|The Windows Update web app, version 4, in [[Windows ME]]]]\nWindows Update was introduced as a [[web app]] with the launch of [[Windows 98]] and offered additional [[Theme (computing)|desktop themes]], [[Video game|games]], [[device driver]] updates, and optional components such as [[NetMeeting]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/win98/TWB19980625S0017\n|title=Taking Windows 98 For A Test-Drive\n|last=Gartner\n|first=John\n|date=24 August 1995\n|website=TechWeb\n|publisher=CMP Net\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203021627/http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/win98/TWB19980625S0017\n|archivedate=3 December 2012\n}}</ref> Windows 95 and [[Windows NT 4.0]] were retroactively given the ability to access the Windows Update website and download updates designed for those operating systems, starting with the release of [[Internet Explorer 4]]. The initial focus of Windows Update was free add-ons and new technologies for Windows. Security fixes for [[Outlook Express]], Internet Explorer and other programs appeared later, as did access to beta versions of upcoming Microsoft software, e.g. [[Internet Explorer 5]]. Fixes to Windows 98 to resolve the [[Year 2000 problem]] were distributed using Windows Update in December 1998. Microsoft attributed the sales success of Windows 98 in part to Windows Update.<ref>{{cite press release\n|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1999/feb99/holislpr.mspx\n|title=Strong Holiday Sales Make Windows 98 Best-Selling Software of 1998\n|date=9 February 1999\n|accessdate=2008-07-29\n|work=PressPass\n|publisher=[[Microsoft]]\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Windows Update web app requires either [[Internet Explorer]] or a third-party [[web browser]] that supports the [[ActiveX]] technology.  The first version of the web app, version 3, does not send any personally-identifiable information to Microsoft. Instead, the app downloads a full list of every available update and chooses which one to download and install. But the list grew so large that the performance impact of processing became a concern. Arie Slob, writing for the Windows-help.net newsletter in March 2003, noted that the size of the update list had exceeded {{Nowrap|400 [[Kilobyte|KB]]}}, which caused delays of more than a minute for [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up]] users.<ref name=\"arieslob\">{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsnewsletter.com/html-archive/2003/22mar2003.html|title=Windows Update is Spying on You!|last=Slob|first=Arie|date=March 22, 2003|website=Windows-Help.NET|publisher=InfiniSource|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020429/http://www.windowsnewsletter.com/html-archive/2003/22mar2003.html|archive-date=January 14, 2018|accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref> Windows Update v4, released in 2001 in conjunction with [[Windows XP]], changed this. This version of the app makes an inventory of the system's hardware and Microsoft software and sends them to the service, thus offloading the processing burden to Microsoft [[Server (computing)|servers]].<ref name=\"arieslob\" />{{Clear}}\n\n===Critical Update Notification Utility===\n[[File:Windows 98 - Critical Update Notification.png|thumb|Screenshot of the Critical Update Notification [[dialog box]] in [[Windows 98]].|alt=]]\n'''Critical Update Notification Utility''' (initially '''Critical Update Notification Tool''') is a [[background process]] that checks the Windows Update web site on a regular schedule for new updates that have been marked as \"Critical\". It was released shortly after Windows 98.\n\nBy default, this check occurs every five minutes, plus when Internet Explorer starts; however, the user could configure the next check to occur only at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week. The tool queries the Microsoft server for a file called \"<code>cucif.cab</code>\", which contained<!--Not anymore--> a list of all the critical updates released for the operating system. The tool then compares this list with the list of installed updates on its machine and displays an update availability notification.  Once the check is executed, any custom schedule defined by the user is reverted to the default. Microsoft stated that this ensures that users received notification of critical updates in a timely manner.<ref name=\"cun-kb\">{{Cite web |url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/224420/description-of-the-windows-critical-update-notification-utility |title=Description of the Windows Critical Update Notification utility |date=5 December 2007 |website=Support |publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\nAn analysis done by security researcher [[H. D. Moore]] in early 1999 was critical of this approach, describing it as \"horribly inefficient\" and susceptible to attacks.  In a posting to [[BugTraq]], he explained that, \"every single Windows 98 computer that wishes to get an update has to rely on a single host for the security. If that one server got compromised one day, or an attacker cracks the [Microsoft] DNS server again, there could be millions of users installing [[trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] every hour. The scope of this attack is big enough to attract crackers who actually know what they are doing...\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://seclists.org/bugtraq/1999/Jan/0400.html |title=How the MS Critical Update Notification works... |last=Moore |first=H. D. |date=29 January 1999 |website=BugTraq mailing list archive |via=seclists.org}}</ref>\n\nMicrosoft continued to promote the tool through 1999 and the first half of 2000. Initial releases of [[Windows 2000]] shipped with the tool. The tool did not support Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.\n\n===Automatic Updates===\n[[File:Winautoupdates.PNG|thumb|Automatic Updates \"Restart Required\" [[dialog box]] in [[Windows XP]] SP1|alt=]]\n'''Automatic Updates''' is the successor of the Critical Update Notification Utility. It was released in 2000, along with [[Windows Me]]. It supports Windows 2000 SP3 as well.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, Automatic Updates can download and install updates. Instead of the five-minute schedule used by its predecessor, Automatic Updates checks the Windows Update servers once a day. After Windows Me is installed, a [[balloon help|notification balloon]] prompts the user to configure the Automatic Updates client. The user can choose from three notification schemes: Being notified before downloading the update, being notified before installing the update, or both.\n\nWindows XP and Windows 2000 SP3 include [[Background Intelligent Transfer Service]], a [[Windows service]] for transferring files in the background without user interaction. As a system component, it is capable of monitoring the user's Internet usage, and throttling its own bandwidth usage in order to prioritize user-initiated activities. The Automatic Updates client for these operating systems was updated to use this system service.\n\nAutomatic Updates in Windows XP gained notoriety for repeatedly interrupting the user while working on their computer. Every time an update requiring a reboot was installed, Automatic Updates would prompt the user with a dialog box that allowed the user to restart immediately or dismiss the dialog box, which would reappear in ten minutes; a behavior that [[Jeff Atwood]] described as \"perhaps the naggiest dialog box ever.\"<ref name=\"atwood\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.codinghorror.com/xp-automatic-update-nagging/|title=XP Automatic Update Nagging|last=Atwood|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Atwood|date=13 May 2005|website=Coding Horror: Programming and Human Factors|url-status=live|accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, it was observed that shortly after the [[Booting|startup process]], Automatic Updates (<code>wuauclt.exe</code>) and Service Host (<code>[[svchost.exe]])</code> in Windows XP would claim 100% of a computer's CPU capacity for extended periods of time (between ten minutes to two hours), making affected computers unusable. According to Woody Leonhart of [[InfoWorld]], early reports of this issue could be seen in [[Microsoft TechNet]] [[Internet forum|forums]] in late May 2013, although Microsoft first received large number of complaints about this issue in September 2013. The cause was an [[exponential algorithm]] in the evaluation of superseded updates which had grown large over the decade following the release of Windows XP. Microsoft's attempts to fix the issue in October, November and December proved futile, causing the issue to be escalated to the top priority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/exponential-algorithm-making-windows-xp-miserable-could-be-fixed/|title=Exponential algorithm making Windows XP miserable could be fixed|last=Bright|first=Peter|date=December 16, 2013|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/2609615/microsoft-promises-to-fix-windows-xp-svchost-redlining--as-soon-as-possible-.html|title=Microsoft promises to fix Windows XP SVCHOST redlining 'as soon as possible'|last=Leonhard|first=Woody|date=December 16, 2013|website=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Windows Update Agent===\n[[File:Windows Update Restart Vista.png|thumb|Revised restart [[dialog box]] in [[Windows Vista]]|alt=]]\nStarting with [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]], '''Windows Update Agent''' replaces both the Windows Update web app and the Automatic Updates client.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/949104/how-to-update-the-windows-update-agent-to-the-latest-version|title=How to update the Windows Update Agent to the latest version|last=|first=|date=6 June 2017|website=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc735627(v=ws.10).aspx|title=Windows Update Agent|last=|first=|date=13 December 2007|website=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It is in charge of downloading and installing software update from Windows Update, as well as the on-premises servers of [[Windows Server Update Services|Windows Server Updates Services]] or [[System Center Configuration Manager]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb932139.aspx|title=How to Install the Windows Update Agent on Client Computers|last=|first=|date=2007|website=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/Microsoft-Windows-Update-Agent|title=Microsoft Windows Update Agent|last=Rouse|first=Margaret|date=May 2014|website=TechTarget|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWindows Update Agent can be managed through a [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] applet, as well as [[Group Policy]], [[Microsoft Intune]] and [[Windows PowerShell]]. It can also be set to automatically download and install both ''important'' and ''recommended'' updates.  In prior versions of Windows, such updates were only available through the Windows Update web site. Additionally, Windows Update in Windows Vista supports downloading [[Windows Ultimate Extras]], optional software for Windows Vista Ultimate Edition.\n\nUnlike Automatic Updates in Windows XP, Windows Update Agent in Windows Vista and Windows 7 allows the user to postpone the mandatory restart (required for the update process to complete) for up to four hours. The revised dialog box that prompts for the restart appears under other windows, instead of on top of them. However, standard user accounts only have 15 minutes to respond to this dialog box. This was changed with [[Windows 8]]: Users have 3 days (72 hours) before the computer reboots automatically after installing automatic updates that require a reboot. Windows 8 also consolidates the restart requests for non-critical updates into just one per month. Additionally, the login screen notifies them of the restart requirements.<ref>{{cite web |last=Savov |first=Vlad |url=https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/15/2563251/windows-8-update-restart-consolidation |title=Windows 8 auto-update will consolidate restarts into one per month, give you three days to do it |website=[[The Verge]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |date=15 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nWindows Update Agent makes use of the [[Transactional NTFS]] feature introduced with Windows Vista to apply updates to Windows system files.

In response to the need of organizations for deploying updates to many machines, Microsoft introduced what was ultimately called [[Windows Server Update Services]] (WSUS). WSUS downloads updates for Microsoft product to a [[server computer]] on which it is running and redistributes them to the computers within the organization over a [[local area network]] (LAN). One of the benefits of this method is a reduction in the consumption of Internet bandwidth, equal to ''(N-1)\u00d7S'', where N is the number of computers in the organization and S is the size made by the updates. Additionally, WSUS permits administrators to test updates on a small group of test computers before deploying them to all systems, in order to ensure that business continuity is not disrupted because of the changes of the updates. For very large organizations, multiple WSUS servers can be chained together hierarchically. Only one server in this hierarchy downloads from the Internet. WSUS is a component of the [[Windows Server]] family of operating systems.\n\nUpdate packages distributed via the Windows Update service can be individually downloaded from [[Microsoft Update Catalog]]. These updates can be delivered to computers without any network connections (e.g. using a USB flash drive) or used [[Slipstream (computing)|deploy Microsoft products in pre-updated state]]. In case of the former, Windows Update Agent (<code>wusa.exe</code>) can install these files. In case of the latter, Microsoft deployment utilities such as [[Deployment Image Service and Management Tool|DISM]], [[Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit|WADK]] and [[Microsoft Deployment Toolkit|MDT]] can consume these packages.\n\nMicrosoft offers [[System Center Configuration Manager]] for very complex deployment and servicing scenarios. The product integrates with all of the aforesaid tools (WSUS, DISM, WADK, MDT) to automate the process.\n\n==Service==\nAt the beginning of 2005, Windows Update was being accessed by about 150 million people,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/02-15RSA05.aspx\n|title=RSA Conference 2005: \"Security: Raising the Bar\" (speech transcript)\n|date=15 February 2005\n|accessdate=2008-07-30\n|work=PressPass\n|publisher=[[Microsoft]]\n}}</ref> with about 112 million of those using Automatic Updates.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/jan05/01-06newsolutionspr.mspx\n|title=Microsoft Announces Availability of New Solutions to Help Protect Customers Against Spyware and Viruses\n|date=6 January 2005\n|accessdate=2008-07-30\n|work=PressPass\n|publisher=[[Microsoft]]\n}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2008, Windows Update had about 500 million clients, processed about 350 million unique scans per day, and maintained an average of 1.5 million simultaneous connections to client machines.

The service delivers software updates for Windows, as well as the various Microsoft [[Antivirus software|antivirus products]], including [[Windows Defender]] and [[Microsoft Security Essentials]]. Since its inception, Microsoft has introduced two extensions of the service: '''Microsoft Update''' and '''Windows Update for Business'''. The former expands the core service to include other Microsoft products, such as [[Microsoft Office]] and [[Microsoft Expression Studio]]. The latter is available to business editions of [[Windows 10]] and permits postponing updates or receiving updates only after they have undergone rigorous testing.\n\nAs the service has evolved over the years, so have its client software. For a decade, the primary client component of the service was the Windows Update [[web app]] that could only be run inside [[Internet Explorer]]. Starting with [[Windows Vista]], the primary client component became Windows Update Agent, an integral component of the operating system.\n\nThe service provides several kinds of updates. ''Security updates'' or ''critical updates'' mitigate vulnerabilities against [[exploit (computer security)|security exploits]] against Microsoft Windows. ''Cumulative updates'' are updates that bundle multiple updates, both new and previously released updates. Cumulative updates were introduced with [[Windows 10]] and have been backported to [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows 8.1]].\n\nMicrosoft routinely releases updates on the second Tuesday of each month (known as the [[Patch Tuesday]]), but can provide them whenever a new update is urgently required to prevent a newly discovered or prevalent exploit. System administrators can configure Windows Update to install critical updates for Microsoft Windows automatically, so long as the computer has an Internet connection.\n\n==Clients==\n===Windows Update web app===\n[[File:Win Update ME.png|thumb|left|The Windows Update web app, version 4, in [[Windows ME]]]]\nWindows Update was introduced as a [[web app]] with the launch of [[Windows 98]] and offered additional [[Theme (computing)|desktop themes]], [[Video game|games]], [[device driver]] updates, and optional components such as [[NetMeeting]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/win98/TWB19980625S0017\n|title=Taking Windows 98 For A Test-Drive\n|last=Gartner\n|first=John\n|date=24 August 1995\n|website=TechWeb\n|publisher=CMP Net\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981203021627/http://www.techweb.com/wire/story/win98/TWB19980625S0017\n|archivedate=3 December 2012\n}}</ref> Windows 95 and [[Windows NT 4.0]] were retroactively given the ability to access the Windows Update website and download updates designed for those operating systems, starting with the release of [[Internet Explorer 4]]. The initial focus of Windows Update was free add-ons and new technologies for Windows. Security fixes for [[Outlook Express]], Internet Explorer and other programs appeared later, as did access to beta versions of upcoming Microsoft software, e.g. [[Internet Explorer 5]]. Fixes to Windows 98 to resolve the [[Year 2000 problem]] were distributed using Windows Update in December 1998. Microsoft attributed the sales success of Windows 98 in part to Windows Update.<ref>{{cite press release\n|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1999/feb99/holislpr.mspx\n|title=Strong Holiday Sales Make Windows 98 Best-Selling Software of 1998\n|date=9 February 1999\n|accessdate=2008-07-29\n|work=PressPass\n|publisher=[[Microsoft]]\n}}</ref>\n\nThe Windows Update web app requires either [[Internet Explorer]] or a third-party [[web browser]] that supports the [[ActiveX]] technology.  The first version of the web app, version 3, does not send any personally-identifiable information to Microsoft. Instead, the app downloads a full list of every available update and chooses which one to download and install. But the list grew so large that the performance impact of processing became a concern. Arie Slob, writing for the Windows-help.net newsletter in March 2003, noted that the size of the update list had exceeded {{Nowrap|400 [[Kilobyte|KB]]}}, which caused delays of more than a minute for [[dial-up Internet access|dial-up]] users.<ref name=\"arieslob\">{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsnewsletter.com/html-archive/2003/22mar2003.html|title=Windows Update is Spying on You!|last=Slob|first=Arie|date=March 22, 2003|website=Windows-Help.NET|publisher=InfiniSource|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020429/http://www.windowsnewsletter.com/html-archive/2003/22mar2003.html|archive-date=January 14, 2018|accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref> Windows Update v4, released in 2001 in conjunction with [[Windows XP]], changed this.

It was released shortly after Windows 98.\n\nBy default, this check occurs every five minutes, plus when Internet Explorer starts; however, the user could configure the next check to occur only at certain times of the day or on certain days of the week. The tool queries the Microsoft server for a file called \"<code>cucif.cab</code>\", which contained<!--Not anymore--> a list of all the critical updates released for the operating system. The tool then compares this list with the list of installed updates on its machine and displays an update availability notification.  Once the check is executed, any custom schedule defined by the user is reverted to the default. Microsoft stated that this ensures that users received notification of critical updates in a timely manner.<ref name=\"cun-kb\">{{Cite web |url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/224420/description-of-the-windows-critical-update-notification-utility |title=Description of the Windows Critical Update Notification utility |date=5 December 2007 |website=Support |publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}</ref>\n\nAn analysis done by security researcher [[H. D. Moore]] in early 1999 was critical of this approach, describing it as \"horribly inefficient\" and susceptible to attacks.  In a posting to [[BugTraq]], he explained that, \"every single Windows 98 computer that wishes to get an update has to rely on a single host for the security. If that one server got compromised one day, or an attacker cracks the [Microsoft] DNS server again, there could be millions of users installing [[trojan horse (computing)|trojans]] every hour.

Initial releases of [[Windows 2000]] shipped with the tool. The tool did not support Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.\n\n===Automatic Updates===\n[[File:Winautoupdates.PNG|thumb|Automatic Updates \"Restart Required\" [[dialog box]] in [[Windows XP]] SP1|alt=]]\n'''Automatic Updates''' is the successor of the Critical Update Notification Utility. It was released in 2000, along with [[Windows Me]]. It supports Windows 2000 SP3 as well.\n\nUnlike its predecessor, Automatic Updates can download and install updates. Instead of the five-minute schedule used by its predecessor, Automatic Updates checks the Windows Update servers once a day. After Windows Me is installed, a [[balloon help|notification balloon]] prompts the user to configure the Automatic Updates client. The user can choose from three notification schemes: Being notified before downloading the update, being notified before installing the update, or both.\n\nWindows XP and Windows 2000 SP3 include [[Background Intelligent Transfer Service]], a [[Windows service]] for transferring files in the background without user interaction. As a system component, it is capable of monitoring the user's Internet usage, and throttling its own bandwidth usage in order to prioritize user-initiated activities. The Automatic Updates client for these operating systems was updated to use this system service.\n\nAutomatic Updates in Windows XP gained notoriety for repeatedly interrupting the user while working on their computer. Every time an update requiring a reboot was installed, Automatic Updates would prompt the user with a dialog box that allowed the user to restart immediately or dismiss the dialog box, which would reappear in ten minutes; a behavior that [[Jeff Atwood]] described as \"perhaps the naggiest dialog box ever.\"<ref name=\"atwood\">{{cite web|url=https://blog.codinghorror.com/xp-automatic-update-nagging/|title=XP Automatic Update Nagging|last=Atwood|first=Jeff|authorlink=Jeff Atwood|date=13 May 2005|website=Coding Horror: Programming and Human Factors|url-status=live|accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, it was observed that shortly after the [[Booting|startup process]], Automatic Updates (<code>wuauclt.exe</code>) and Service Host (<code>[[svchost.exe]])</code> in Windows XP would claim 100% of a computer's CPU capacity for extended periods of time (between ten minutes to two hours), making affected computers unusable. According to Woody Leonhart of [[InfoWorld]], early reports of this issue could be seen in [[Microsoft TechNet]] [[Internet forum|forums]] in late May 2013, although Microsoft first received large number of complaints about this issue in September 2013. The cause was an [[exponential algorithm]] in the evaluation of superseded updates which had grown large over the decade following the release of Windows XP. Microsoft's attempts to fix the issue in October, November and December proved futile, causing the issue to be escalated to the top priority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/exponential-algorithm-making-windows-xp-miserable-could-be-fixed/|title=Exponential algorithm making Windows XP miserable could be fixed|last=Bright|first=Peter|date=December 16, 2013|website=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[Cond\u00e9 Nast]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/2609615/microsoft-promises-to-fix-windows-xp-svchost-redlining--as-soon-as-possible-.html|title=Microsoft promises to fix Windows XP SVCHOST redlining 'as soon as possible'|last=Leonhard|first=Woody|date=December 16, 2013|website=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=[[IDG]]|url-status=live|access-date=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Windows Update Agent===\n[[File:Windows Update Restart Vista.png|thumb|Revised restart [[dialog box]] in [[Windows Vista]]|alt=]]\nStarting with [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]], '''Windows Update Agent''' replaces both the Windows Update web app and the Automatic Updates client.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/949104/how-to-update-the-windows-update-agent-to-the-latest-version|title=How to update the Windows Update Agent to the latest version|last=|first=|date=6 June 2017|website=Support|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc735627(v=ws.10).aspx|title=Windows Update Agent|last=|first=|date=13 December 2007|website=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> It is in charge of downloading and installing software update from Windows Update, as well as the on-premises servers of [[Windows Server Update Services|Windows Server Updates Services]] or [[System Center Configuration Manager]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb932139.aspx|title=How to Install the Windows Update Agent on Client Computers|last=|first=|date=2007|website=[[Microsoft TechNet|TechNet]]|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://searchwindowsserver.techtarget.com/definition/Microsoft-Windows-Update-Agent|title=Microsoft Windows Update Agent|last=Rouse|first=Margaret|date=May 2014|website=TechTarget|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWindows Update Agent can be managed through a [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]] applet, as well as [[Group Policy]], [[Microsoft Intune]] and [[Windows PowerShell]]. It can also be set to automatically download and install both ''important'' and ''recommended'' updates.  In prior versions of Windows, such updates were only available through the Windows Update web site. Additionally, Windows Update in Windows Vista supports downloading [[Windows Ultimate Extras]], optional software for Windows Vista Ultimate Edition.\n\nUnlike Automatic Updates in Windows XP, Windows Update Agent in Windows Vista and Windows 7 allows the user to postpone the mandatory restart (required for the update process to complete) for up to four hours. The revised dialog box that prompts for the restart appears under other windows, instead of on top of them. However, standard user accounts only have 15 minutes to respond to this dialog box. This was changed with [[Windows 8]]: Users have 3 days (72 hours) before the computer reboots automatically after installing automatic updates that require a reboot.

In response to the need of organizations for deploying updates to many machines, Microsoft introduced what was ultimately called [[Windows Server Update Services]] (WSUS). WSUS downloads updates for Microsoft product to a [[server computer]] on which it is running and redistributes them to the computers within the organization over a [[local area network]] (LAN). One of the benefits of this method is a reduction in the consumption of Internet bandwidth, equal to ''(N-1)\u00d7S'', where N is the number of computers in the organization and S is the size made by the updates. Additionally, WSUS permits administrators to test updates on a small group of test computers before deploying them to all systems, in order to ensure that business continuity is not disrupted because of the changes of the updates. For very large organizations, multiple WSUS servers can be chained together hierarchically. Only one server in this hierarchy downloads from the Internet. WSUS is a component of the [[Windows Server]] family of operating systems.\n\nUpdate packages distributed via the Windows Update service can be individually downloaded from [[Microsoft Update Catalog]]. These updates can be delivered to computers without any network connections (e.g. using a USB flash drive) or used [[Slipstream (computing)|deploy Microsoft products in pre-updated state]]. In case of the former, Windows Update Agent (<code>wusa.exe</code>) can install these files. In case of the latter, Microsoft deployment utilities such as [[Deployment Image Service and Management Tool|DISM]], [[Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit|WADK]] and [[Microsoft Deployment Toolkit|MDT]] can consume these packages.\n\nMicrosoft offers [[System Center Configuration Manager]] for very complex deployment and servicing scenarios. The product integrates with all of the aforesaid tools (WSUS, DISM, WADK, MDT) to automate the process.\n\n==Service==\nAt the beginning of 2005, Windows Update was being accessed by about 150 million people,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/02-15RSA05.aspx\n|title=RSA Conference 2005: \"Security: Raising the Bar\" (speech transcript)\n|date=15 February 2005\n|accessdate=2008-07-30\n|work=PressPass\n|publisher=[[Microsoft]]\n}}</ref> with about 112 million of those using Automatic Updates.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/jan05/01-06newsolutionspr.mspx\n|title=Microsoft Announces Availability of New Solutions to Help Protect Customers Against Spyware and Viruses\n|date=6 January 2005\n|accessdate=2008-07-30\n|work=PressPass\n|publisher=[[Microsoft]]\n}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2008, Windows Update had about 500 million clients, processed about 350 million unique scans per day, and maintained an average of 1.5 million simultaneous connections to client machines.

The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]].

He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms.

She is Punn's love interest and Korn's childhood friend.\n* Atthaphan Phunsawat as Punn Taweesilp\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Punn has the power of imitation and ability mastering, which enables him to perfectly copy a skill by watching or studying but causes him to develop [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] (his normal self, the leader, the paranoid, the belligerent, and the suicidal). His power is associated with his [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], being an academic achiever and his eagerness to learn different things. He was elected as Head Student of the Gifted class until his resignation. He is Claire's love interest.\n* Pattadon Janngeon as  Thanakorn \"Korn\" Gorbgoon\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program.

The sequel is set to premiere in 2020.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nPawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong ([[Korapat Kirdpan]]) is a struggling, ordinary 10th grade student in Ritdha High School. Here, a classification system is strictly implemented wherein students are divided into classes based on academic excellence. Pang is in Class VIII, the lowest level, and has no hopes of rising up the hierarchy.\n\nBut everything turns haywire for Pang when he unexpectedly passes the school's Placement Exam, which gives low-class students a chance to step up in their game. Adding to the mystery, he is [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the \"Gifted Program,\" the highest and most special class in school where only a handful of students are accepted. As he goes through their first sessions, Pang starts to feel something strange about the Gifted Program. Soon, he and his Gifted classmates unleash their long-hidden potentials: [[supernatural]] and [[superhuman]] abilities that stem from their [[Personality|personalities]] and [[behavior]].\n\nWhat lies ahead of Pang and his fellow Gifted is a thrilling journey of developing their potentials, discovering the horrible secret behind the Program, and breaking down the system that has been torturing students for generations.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n=== Main ===\n* [[Korapat Kirdpan]] as Pawaret \"Pang\" Sermrittirong\n: Head Student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program; the drama's main [[protagonist]]. Pang was once a struggling student from Class VIII who is soon to be [[Academic acceleration|accelerated]] to the Gifted Program through the school's Placement Exam. Through the Gifted Program, he discovers he has the power of [[Brainwashing|mind control]], in which he can compel someone to do whatever he wishes through physical contact with the subject and feeling their [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]]. He becomes the Gifted Program's Head Student when Director Chueamanee removed Wave from the position after the class' midterm exams. He is close with fellow Gifted students Namtaan and Ohm.\n* [[Wachirawit Ruangwiwat]] as Wasuthorn \"Wave\" Worachotmethee\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Through the Program, Wave discovers his power of technopathy, the ability to control and manipulate electronic machines through contact, a gift associated with his advanced skills in [[mathematics]], [[Computer|computers]], and [[Computer programming|programming]]. He was the Program's Head Student upon Punn's resignation but was ousted by Director Chueamanee after their midterms. He is apparently rude and arrogant, and hates when other students seem to overshadow him. His over-competitiveness was triggered by his bad relationship with his former teacher and crush Ms. Nara, who stole his thesis and framed him of [[plagiarism]].\n* Apichaya Thongkham as Chayanit \"Namtaan\" Prachkarit\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Namtaan discovers her power of [[Psychometry (paranormal)|psychometry]], the ability to see or hear associated events on an object through contact, a gift associated on her character of being nosy.

She is close to Pang and Ohm.\n* Harit Cheewagaroon as Wichai \"Ohm\" Sai-Ngern\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Ohm has a form of [[psychokinesis]] which enables him to make objects (including humans) disappear and bringing them back again by will, which soon evolves to include [[invisibility]] and [[teleportation]] (of himself and other humans). This power is associated with his character of being forgetful and losing things most of the time. When using his power, Ohm experiences [[Nosebleed|nosebleeds]] which indicate that his power has manifested. He is close to Pang and Namtaan, and is known for being the lively one in the Gifted class.\n* Ramida Jiranorraphat as Irin \"Claire\" Jaratpun\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program and member of the Drama Club. Claire has a form of [[synesthesia]] which enables him to see a person's [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] and associate the color of the aura with a certain kind of emotion (e.g. blue for [[sadness]], red for [[anger]], pink for [[love]], etc). Her power is associated with her passion for [[acting]]. She is Punn's love interest and Korn's childhood friend.\n* Atthaphan Phunsawat as Punn Taweesilp\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Punn has the power of imitation and ability mastering, which enables him to perfectly copy a skill by watching or studying but causes him to develop [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personalities]] (his normal self, the leader, the paranoid, the belligerent, and the suicidal). His power is associated with his [[Perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], being an academic achiever and his eagerness to learn different things. He was elected as Head Student of the Gifted class until his resignation. He is Claire's love interest.\n* Pattadon Janngeon as  Thanakorn \"Korn\" Gorbgoon\n: A student of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Korn has the ability to remain [[Wakefulness|awake]] for days without getting sleepy. He has a crush on his childhood friend Claire, until Claire rejected his love.

Mon possesses superhuman strength with enhanced agility, dexterity and coordination that is useful for combat. Her potential is associated with her passion for sports. However, her body produces [[pheromones]] that are excreted through her sweat and tears. Once exposed to it, a person would turn insane, violent and, worse, murderous. She is Art's love interest.\n* Chatchawit Techarukpong as Porama \"Pom\" Wongrattana\n: The class adviser of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program. Mr. Pom belongs to Ritdha High School's Gifted Program Batch 3, and decided to work as a teacher in Ritdha after graduating. He has the power of memory manipulation which enables him to erase [[Memory|memories]], first, by putting the subject in [[hypnosis]] using sound with a regular tempo (through a [[metronome]]) and snapping his fingers, and second, by touching the subject's head while it is in hypnotic state. He is also able to both erase and restore his own memories. His power is associated with his ability to memorize many details. As a teacher, his power is taken into advantage by Director Chueamanee in erasing the memories of students who are involved in incidents related to the Gifted Program.\n* Chayapol Jutamat as Chanuj \"Jack\" Saeliu, and Chayakorn Jutamat as Chanet \"Jo\" Saeliu\n: The [[Twin|identical twin]] students of Ritdha High School's Gifted Program.
