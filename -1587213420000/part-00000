In Indonesia, three cities are famous for their otak-otak; [[Palembang]], [[Jakarta]] and [[Makassar]],<ref name=\"Eats\"/> nevertheless most of coastal fishing towns in Indonesia are familiar with this dish. \nOn the [[Bangka Island|Bangka]] island, the town of Belinyu is famous as a production center of otak-otak.<ref name=\"MI-Otak-otak\"/>\n\nThe southern Malaysian town of [[Muar (town)|Muar]] in Johor is a popular destination for it \u2013 people from surrounding states and even Singaporeans often visit to buy the famous otak-otak in bulk.<ref name=Muar>{{cite web | title=Muar's matchless 'otak-otak' | author=Malaysia Tourism & Travel Guide |work= [[New Straits Times|NST]]| publisher=Tour Malaysia.com | url=http://www.tourmalaysia.com/malaysia-tourism/muars-matchless-otak-otak/  | accessdate=8 October 2014}}</ref> It is commonly known in Singapore as ''otah''.\n\n==Composition==\nOtak-otak is made by mixing [[fish paste]] with a mixture of spices. The type of fish used to make otak-otak might vary, [[mackerel]] is commonly used in Malaysia, while ''ikan tenggiri'' ([[wahoo]]) is popular ingredient in Indonesia. Other types of fish such as ''bandeng'' ([[milkfish]]) and the more expensive ''ikan belida'' ([[featherback]] fish) might be used.<ref name=\"Eats\"/> The ground fish and starch is seasoned with spices which usually includes garlic, [[shallot]], [[coconut milk]], pepper, salt and sugar.\n\nIn Indonesia, the mixture typically contains [[fish paste]], [[shallot]]s, garlic, [[scallion]]s, [[egg (food)|egg]], [[coconut milk]], and [[sago]] starch or can be substituted for [[tapioca]] starch. In Malaysia, it is usually a mixture between [[fish paste]], [[chili pepper]]s, garlic, [[shallot]]s, [[turmeric]], [[lemon grass]] and [[coconut milk]]. The mixture is then wrapped in a banana leaf that has been softened by steaming, then grilled or steamed.<ref>[http://www.tourism.terengganu.gov.my/culinary/otak-otak.htm Otak-otak.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203025412/http://tourism.terengganu.gov.my/culinary/otak-otak.htm |date=3 February 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn Jakarta, Indonesia, one finds otak-otak being sold in small stalls near bus stops, especially during afternoon rush hour. Some of the best otak-otak can be found in Makassar; the main ingredient is fresh king mackerel fish, also called king fish or [[spanish mackerel]].\n\nIn Malaysia Otak-otak is well-known and commonly found in a town called [[Muar (town)|Muar]], Johor located south of West Peninsular Malaysia. The otak-otak from Muar is particularly renowned in Malaysia.<ref name=Muar/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.malaysiabest.my/?p=4884 |title=ONE OF The Best Muar Traditional Authentic Food Taken Famously \"Otak-otak\", been Practiced bt Locals More Than a Decade|work= malaysiabest.my|publisher=Malaysia Best |date=14 October 2014|accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref> The Muar's Otak-otak is extra-ordinary being wrapped inside the mangrove ''attap'' (''[[Nipa palm]]'') leaves and clipped using stapler or toothpick at both ends before being grilled or roasted on the stove.<ref name=Muar/> The flavor combines the fragrance of burnt ''attap'' leaves, the softness of fish meat and chili spices. The degree of spiciness corresponds to the amount of chilies being used. Since otak-otak is boneless fishcake, it is also suitable for children. While fish otak-otak is most common, otak-otak is also made with prawns, often resulting in a more textured variety. In Muar, there is also otak-otak made from [[cuttlefish]], shrimp, crab meat, fish head and even [[Chicken (food)|chicken]].<ref name=Muar/> Other than grilling in wrapped ''attap'' leaves, otak-otak might be conveniently and directly steamed instead.<ref name=Muar/> Steamed otak-otak is in rectangular shape without any attap leaves wrapping. Otak-otak are served best freshly hot, as a side dish with rice or as snacks during tea time.\n\n==Regional varieties==\nThere are different recipes of otak-otak originating from different regions.\n\nIn Indonesia, otak-otak commonly associated with [[Palembang]], South [[Sumatra]].<ref name=\"CNNGo\"/> However, other regions in Indonesia also popular for their otak-otak recipes, such as [[Jakarta]] and [[Makassar]]. In Palembang, people eat otak-otak with ''cuko'' ([[Palembang]]ese sweet and sour spicy vinegar sauce), while accross the strait on [[Bangka Belitung]] islands, the slightly different sour ''cuko'' sauce is made with a mixture of vinegar, shrimp paste and [[tauco]] fermented soybean paste.<ref name=\"MI-Otak-otak\"/> In Jakarta however, they enjoy it with spicy [[peanut sauce]].<ref name=\"CNNGo\"/> \n\nMalaysian Nyonya otak-otak (Malay: ''otak-otak Nyonya''), with [[Peranakan]] origins, from the northern Malaysian state of [[Penang]], is steamed as a cake in [[banana leaf]]. The otak-otak from Indonesia, the south of Malaysia, and Singapore is wrapped up as a thin slice using banana or coconut leaf and grilled over a charcoal fire. As a result, it ends up drier and with a more distinct smoky fish aroma. The colour of otak-otak from Indonesia is whitish, while the otak-otak from Malaysia and Singapore is reddish-orange. Other varieties of otak-otak do exist. Although otak-otak is traditionally made with fish meat, modern versions of otak may use [[Crab meat|crab]] or [[prawn]] meat or even fish head.\n\n== Similar dishes ==\nA type of delicacy similar to otak-otak from [[Terengganu]] is called [[Sata (food)|Sata]]. A similar Indonesian dish employing banana leaf is called [[pepes]]. Other types of otak-otak include dishes called ''pais ikan'', ''[[botok]]'' that are made of fish paste cooked in banana leaves.

The type of fish used to make otak-otak might vary, [[mackerel]] is commonly used in Malaysia, while ''ikan tenggiri'' ([[wahoo]]) is popular ingredient in Indonesia. Other types of fish such as ''bandeng'' ([[milkfish]]) and the more expensive ''ikan belida'' ([[featherback]] fish) might be used.<ref name=\"Eats\"/> The ground fish and starch is seasoned with spices which usually includes garlic, [[shallot]], [[coconut milk]], pepper, salt and sugar.\n\nIn Indonesia, the mixture typically contains [[fish paste]], [[shallot]]s, garlic, [[scallion]]s, [[egg (food)|egg]], [[coconut milk]], and [[sago]] starch or can be substituted for [[tapioca]] starch. In Malaysia, it is usually a mixture between [[fish paste]], [[chili pepper]]s, garlic, [[shallot]]s, [[turmeric]], [[lemon grass]] and [[coconut milk]]. The mixture is then wrapped in a banana leaf that has been softened by steaming, then grilled or steamed.<ref>[http://www.tourism.terengganu.gov.my/culinary/otak-otak.htm Otak-otak.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203025412/http://tourism.terengganu.gov.my/culinary/otak-otak.htm |date=3 February 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn Jakarta, Indonesia, one finds otak-otak being sold in small stalls near bus stops, especially during afternoon rush hour. Some of the best otak-otak can be found in Makassar; the main ingredient is fresh king mackerel fish, also called king fish or [[spanish mackerel]].\n\nIn Malaysia Otak-otak is well-known and commonly found in a town called [[Muar (town)|Muar]], Johor located south of West Peninsular Malaysia. The otak-otak from Muar is particularly renowned in Malaysia.<ref name=Muar/><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.malaysiabest.my/?p=4884 |title=ONE OF The Best Muar Traditional Authentic Food Taken Famously \"Otak-otak\", been Practiced bt Locals More Than a Decade|work= malaysiabest.my|publisher=Malaysia Best |date=14 October 2014|accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref> The Muar's Otak-otak is extra-ordinary being wrapped inside the mangrove ''attap'' (''[[Nipa palm]]'') leaves and clipped using stapler or toothpick at both ends before being grilled or roasted on the stove.<ref name=Muar/> The flavor combines the fragrance of burnt ''attap'' leaves, the softness of fish meat and chili spices. The degree of spiciness corresponds to the amount of chilies being used. Since otak-otak is boneless fishcake, it is also suitable for children. While fish otak-otak is most common, otak-otak is also made with prawns, often resulting in a more textured variety. In Muar, there is also otak-otak made from [[cuttlefish]], shrimp, crab meat, fish head and even [[Chicken (food)|chicken]].<ref name=Muar/> Other than grilling in wrapped ''attap'' leaves, otak-otak might be conveniently and directly steamed instead.<ref name=Muar/> Steamed otak-otak is in rectangular shape without any attap leaves wrapping. Otak-otak are served best freshly hot, as a side dish with rice or as snacks during tea time.\n\n==Regional varieties==\nThere are different recipes of otak-otak originating from different regions.\n\nIn Indonesia, otak-otak commonly associated with [[Palembang]], South [[Sumatra]].<ref name=\"CNNGo\"/> However, other regions in Indonesia also popular for their otak-otak recipes, such as [[Jakarta]] and [[Makassar]]. In Palembang, people eat otak-otak with ''cuko'' ([[Palembang]]ese sweet and sour spicy vinegar sauce), while accross the strait on [[Bangka Belitung]] islands, the slightly different sour ''cuko'' sauce is made with a mixture of vinegar, shrimp paste and [[tauco]] fermented soybean paste.<ref name=\"MI-Otak-otak\"/> In Jakarta however, they enjoy it with spicy [[peanut sauce]].<ref name=\"CNNGo\"/> \n\nMalaysian Nyonya otak-otak (Malay: ''otak-otak Nyonya''), with [[Peranakan]] origins, from the northern Malaysian state of [[Penang]], is steamed as a cake in [[banana leaf]]. The otak-otak from Indonesia, the south of Malaysia, and Singapore is wrapped up as a thin slice using banana or coconut leaf and grilled over a charcoal fire. As a result, it ends up drier and with a more distinct smoky fish aroma. The colour of otak-otak from Indonesia is whitish, while the otak-otak from Malaysia and Singapore is reddish-orange. Other varieties of otak-otak do exist. Although otak-otak is traditionally made with fish meat, modern versions of otak may use [[Crab meat|crab]] or [[prawn]] meat or even fish head.\n\n== Similar dishes ==\nA type of delicacy similar to otak-otak from [[Terengganu]] is called [[Sata (food)|Sata]]. A similar Indonesian dish employing banana leaf is called [[pepes]]. Other types of otak-otak include dishes called ''pais ikan'', ''[[botok]]'' that are made of fish paste cooked in banana leaves. Otak-otak is quite similar to [[Szczecin paprikas]] ({{lang-pl|Paprykarz szczeci\u0144ski}}). \n\nThe Philippines has a similar delicacy called ''[[tupig]]'', which is cooked in the same manner as otak-otak \u2013 albeit the former is a sweet version. A thick batter made of glutinous rice flour (known locally as ''galapong'') coconut strips, coconut milk, sugar and nuts is wrapped in banana leaves, and then grilled over coals. ''Tupig'' is a well-known delicacy in the northern Philippine province of [[Pangasinan]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Food|Indonesia|Malaysia|Singapore}}\n* [[Palembang cuisine]]\n* [[Peranakan cuisine]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Otak-otak}}\n* [http://indonesiancuisinerecipe.wordpress.com/2011/12/28/otak-otak-fish-cake-grilled-in-banana-leaves/ Otak-otak Jakarta recipe]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080302144928/http://kuali.com/recipes/viewrecipe.asp?r=767 Otak-Otak Recipe]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100203025412/http://tourism.terengganu.gov.my/culinary/otak-otak.htm Terengganu government tourism \u2013 Otak-otak.]\n\n{{Indonesian cuisine}}\n{{Malaysian cuisine}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Indonesian snack foods]]\n[[Category:Singaporean cuisine]]\n[[Category:Indonesian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Malaysian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Muar District]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toBangka(link changed toBangka Island) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otak-otak"}

Additionally, users are able to opt out at any time, clearing all personal information. Contact tracing is done entirely locally on a user's device using [[Bluetooth]], storing all encounters in a contact history log chronicling contact for the past 21 days. Users in contact logs are identified using anonymous time-shifting \"temporary IDs\" issued by the [[Department of Health (Australia)|Department of Health]] (DoH). This means a users identity cannot be ascertained by anyone except the DoH. Additionally, since temporary IDs change on a regular basis, malicious third parties cannot track users by observing log entries over time.\n\nOnce a user tests positive for infection, the DoH requests the contact log. If the user chooses to share their log, it is sent to the health authority where they match the temporary ID with contact information. Health authorities are not able to access log entries about foreign users, so those entries are sent to the appropriate health authority to be processed there.

What Greta does is incredibly inspiring but actually relatively far from that.\"<ref>[https://abi.unicum.de/aktuelles/zuendstoff/schuelerstreik-luisa-neubauer ''Sch\u00fclerstreik: Organisatorin Luisa Neubauer im Interview. \"Wir sind nicht mehr zu \u00fcbersehen\"'']. abi.unicum.de.

More important is the work behind the strikes: \"What we're doing is incredibly sustainable. We're creating structures and turning the events into educational experiences. And we're leading debates on the principles of climate protection.\"<ref>''Mit voller Wucht. Luisa Neubauer ist das deutsche Gesicht der Klimaproteste.

Man-made climate change is real and by now we're experiencing the grave changes that it's bringing.

Many media outlets refer to her as the \"German face of the movement.\" Neubauer rejects comparisons of herself and other strike organisers to [[Greta Thunberg]], saying: \"We're building a mass-movement and reaching out quite far in our methods of mobilising and gaining attention. What Greta does is incredibly inspiring but actually relatively far from that.\"<ref>[https://abi.unicum.de/aktuelles/zuendstoff/schuelerstreik-luisa-neubauer ''Sch\u00fclerstreik: Organisatorin Luisa Neubauer im Interview. \"Wir sind nicht mehr zu \u00fcbersehen\"'']. abi.unicum.de. Abgerufen am 31. M\u00e4rz 2019</ref>\n\nNeubauer does not see the strikes as a means of ''directly'' affecting politics. More important is the work behind the strikes: \"What we're doing is incredibly sustainable. We're creating structures and turning the events into educational experiences. And we're leading debates on the principles of climate protection.\"<ref>''Mit voller Wucht. Luisa Neubauer ist das deutsche Gesicht der Klimaproteste.

But instead of hitting the brakes, it accelerates. We were put into this car without anyone asking us. This abyss really exists. Man-made climate change is real and by now we're experiencing the grave changes that it's bringing. [...] And by \"we\" I mean the generation that will have to deal with the consequences more than any other.

They were held under the new [[Constitution of Singapore|constitution]] and the first in which all 51 seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]] were elected. This was the first election victory for the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), as they won a [[landslide victory]] with 43 seats, and the party has since remained in power after the elections.\n\n==Background==\n===Political developments===\n[[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], the politician who led the ruling [[Labour Front]] after winning the [[1955 Singaporean general election|previous general election in 1955]], was vocally anti-British and anti-colonialist, and the British found it difficult to come to an agreement or a compromise about a plan for self-government; Marshall resigned from the party a year later, pledging that he would either achieve self-government or to resign. In his place, [[Lim Yew Hock]] pursued an aggressive [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] campaign and manage to convince the British to make a definite plan for self-government.\n\nBy the time of the 1959 elections the Labour Front was in turmoil; Lim's strategy against the communists alienated a large part of the [[Chinese Singaporean]] electorate, which was the demographic targeted most during the anti-communist campaign. Lim's campaign also saw allegations of [[civil rights]] violations as many activists were detained without trial with the justification of [[national security|internal security]] and tear gas were used against demonstrating students during the 1956 [[Chinese middle schools riots]] which were both anti-colonialist and anti-communist alike.\n\n===Constitutional reform===\nThe Constitution of Singapore was revised accordingly in 1958, replacing the Rendel Constitution with one that granted Singapore self-government and the ability for its own population to fully elect its Legislative Assembly. Previously under the Rendel Constitution, drawn up in 1955 by a commission led by [[George William Rendel]], the Legislative Assembly and its leaders could not fully be determined by the population; the British government appointed seven of the 32 members, with the remaining 25 seats elected by the public, albeit with [[limited suffrage]]. This itself was an improvement from the pre-1955 [[Legislative Council of Singapore|Legislative Council]], electing nine members to the council.\n\nThis election was the first election after its full internal [[History of Singapore#Self-government (1955\u20131963)|self-government]] granted by the British authorities; Singapore was now a recognised [[nation-state|state]], but was yet to gain full independence since the British still have external affairs such as the military and foreign relations. Due to the removal of suffrage restrictions, voting was implemented to be [[compulsory voting|compulsory]] for the first time, and had done so in every election since 1959.\n\n===Parties===\nChief Minister [[Lim Yew Hock]] formed [[Singapore People's Alliance]] on 10 November 1958, which consist of previously-elected Labour Front assembly members who were defected from Labour Front. SPA also invited members of Liberal Socialists and Workers' Party. SPA was formed to present a fresh image to voters in the lead up for the 1959 election, and ran on secure full employment and fair working conditions for workers, and achieving independence of Singapore through a merger with Malaya.\n\nThe tenure of Lim Yew Hock as Chief Minister, who succeeded Labour Front's David Marshall after his resignation in 1957, saw scant improvement to living conditions and unpopular tough measures on protesting unions. Lim's government also saw corruption during his tenure, and until the term expiry for Labour Front, all ten elected MPs had resigned from the party due to credibility. These resignations saw the formation of three parties; in 1957, David Marshall founded the [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]] (one of the successful opposition parties of Singapore); in 1958, the [[Singapore People's Alliance]] (founded by Lim) and in 1959, the [[Citizens' Party (Singapore)|Citizens' Party]].\n\nSPA attempted to fight the record of the PAP administration in the [[City Council of Singapore]] with charges of corruptly appointing its supporters to fill up posts in the City Council, as well as raising concerns over the tenders of some Council contracts. The SPA even went as far as setting up a Commission of Inquiry in April 1959 to investigate whether there had been \u201cirregularities or improprieties\u201d in the working of the City Council. The inquiry, however, failed to reveal anything suspicious against the City Council and the hearings were adjourned indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2019-04-08_145822.html |title=1959 Legislative Assembly general election |date=September 2018 |work=[[National Library Board]] |accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://www.singapore-elections.com/general-election/1959/] singapore-elections.com</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2019-04-08_145822.html |title=1959 Legislative Assembly general election |date=September 2018 |work=[[National Library Board]] |accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nA new Party, Liberal Socialist Party (LSP) was formed by a merger of the [[Progressive Party (Singapore)|Progressive Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (Singapore)|Democratic Party]]. The Progressive Party which had won the [[1948 Singaporean general election|1948]] and [[1951 Singaporean general election|1951 elections]] (but lost to Labour Front in the [[1955 Singaporean general election|1955 elections]]) had already fallen out of favour as it was perceived by much of the electorate by working for reform too slowly.\n\nThe Alliance was a coalition comprising the Singapore branch of three political parties from Malaya, namely the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) and the [[Malaysian Indian Congress|Malayan Indian Congress]] (MIC), which they ran on raising the standards of living as well as to strengthen economic ties between Singapore and Malaya. As their parent parties were the ruling coalition in Malaya under [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], the Alliance promised voters that it could work for an early merger if voted into power as they knew \u201cexactly\u201d what their Malayan counterparts wanted. \n\nThe [[Malay Union]] which ran together with UMNO and MCA in the 1955 election, had been expelled from their alliance for putting up a candidate in the 1957 Cairnhill by-election.\n\nThe current opposition party, [[People's Action Party]], announced to contest 51 seats in the election; they released their election manifesto entitled '''The Tasks Ahead''', and outlined the party\u2019s five-year plan to address acute problems faced by Singapore. It called for a series of policies and programmes such as the provision of low-cost housing, the strengthening of education, as well as the development of industries thus improving employment opportunities for the local population. These were in addition to the goal of attaining independence for Singapore through a merger with the Federation of Malaya.\n\nThe PAP campaigned against corruption under the Lim Yew Hock government, and all party members and candidates wore a distinctive outfit of white shirts and pants (which is still the uniform of PAP candidates as of today) to represent \"cleanliness\" in government. SPA attempted to portray the PAP as a party being controlled by the communists, and such claims were repeated by Liberal Socialists and UMNO. Lee Kuan Yew brushed off the claims, describing them as \u201csilly\u201d, \u201cblabbering\u201d and \u201clies\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2019-04-08_145822.html|title=1959 Legislative Assembly general election |date=September 2018 |work=[[National Library Board]] |accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|31 March||Dissolution of 1st Legislative Assembly\n|-\n|25 April||Nomination Day\n|-\n|30 May|| Polling Day\n|-\n|5 June||Inauguration of the Cabinet with [[Lee Kuan Yew]] as inaugural Prime Minister\n|-\n|1 July||Opening of 2nd Legislative Assembly \n|}\n\n==Changes to electoral boundaries==\nThe 51 seats of the Legislative Assembly were elected from [[List of Singaporean electoral divisions (1959\u201363)|single-member constituencies]], with an increase of 26 seats in this election.

The desire for independence and self-government epitomised by the [[Malay language|Malay]] term ''[[Merdeka]]'' (which translates to Independence or Free), had started to become immediate. This was reflected when the cry of ''\"We want Merdeka now!\"'' was taken up by those demanding immediate independence.\n\nPrior to the polling day, the press had predicted that the presence of multi-cornered fights would only split the anti-PAP vote, raising chances of a PAP victory. so that he can take the medal<ref>[http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590530.2.57.aspx The Day of Decision] The Straits Times, 20 May 1959</ref>\n\n===[[Chew Swee Kee]] affair===\nThe Chew Swee Kee affair was also a notable issue raised in the May 1959 elections. In February 1959, PAP charged the incumbent SPA government with receiving political funds from the United States government.\n\nInvestigations by a Commission of Inquiry later revealed that Chew Swee Kee, who was then Education Minister, had converted the alleged funds for his own use.<ref name=\"Jon 1\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7qV6un8vKNUC&pg=PA218 |pages=218\u2013 |title=Curbing Corruption in Asian Countries: An Impossible Dream? |first=Jon S.T. |last=Quah |publisher=Emerald |year=2011 |isbn=9780857248206 }}</ref> The claim has it that Chew accepted around $700,000 to $800,000 from an unrevealed donor{{Sfn|Lee|2008|p=153}} in [[New York City]] as a \"political gift\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5yhvAAAAMAAJ |title=Successful Singapore: A Tiny Nation's Saga from Founder to Accomplisher |pages=191\u2013 |first=George J. |last=Fernandez |year=1992 |publisher=SSMB |isbn=9789971981815 }}</ref> Chew promptly stepped down from his post{{Sfn|Lee|2008|p=153}} on March 4, 1959.

They were held under the new [[Constitution of Singapore|constitution]] and the first in which all 51 seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of Singapore|Legislative Assembly]] were elected. This was the first election victory for the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP), as they won a [[landslide victory]] with 43 seats, and the party has since remained in power after the elections.\n\n==Background==\n===Political developments===\n[[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], the politician who led the ruling [[Labour Front]] after winning the [[1955 Singaporean general election|previous general election in 1955]], was vocally anti-British and anti-colonialist, and the British found it difficult to come to an agreement or a compromise about a plan for self-government; Marshall resigned from the party a year later, pledging that he would either achieve self-government or to resign. In his place, [[Lim Yew Hock]] pursued an aggressive [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] campaign and manage to convince the British to make a definite plan for self-government.\n\nBy the time of the 1959 elections the Labour Front was in turmoil; Lim's strategy against the communists alienated a large part of the [[Chinese Singaporean]] electorate, which was the demographic targeted most during the anti-communist campaign. Lim's campaign also saw allegations of [[civil rights]] violations as many activists were detained without trial with the justification of [[national security|internal security]] and tear gas were used against demonstrating students during the 1956 [[Chinese middle schools riots]] which were both anti-colonialist and anti-communist alike.\n\n===Constitutional reform===\nThe Constitution of Singapore was revised accordingly in 1958, replacing the Rendel Constitution with one that granted Singapore self-government and the ability for its own population to fully elect its Legislative Assembly. Previously under the Rendel Constitution, drawn up in 1955 by a commission led by [[George William Rendel]], the Legislative Assembly and its leaders could not fully be determined by the population; the British government appointed seven of the 32 members, with the remaining 25 seats elected by the public, albeit with [[limited suffrage]]. This itself was an improvement from the pre-1955 [[Legislative Council of Singapore|Legislative Council]], electing nine members to the council.\n\nThis election was the first election after its full internal [[History of Singapore#Self-government (1955\u20131963)|self-government]] granted by the British authorities; Singapore was now a recognised [[nation-state|state]], but was yet to gain full independence since the British still have external affairs such as the military and foreign relations. Due to the removal of suffrage restrictions, voting was implemented to be [[compulsory voting|compulsory]] for the first time, and had done so in every election since 1959.\n\n===Parties===\nChief Minister [[Lim Yew Hock]] formed [[Singapore People's Alliance]] on 10 November 1958, which consist of previously-elected Labour Front assembly members who were defected from Labour Front. SPA also invited members of Liberal Socialists and Workers' Party. SPA was formed to present a fresh image to voters in the lead up for the 1959 election, and ran on secure full employment and fair working conditions for workers, and achieving independence of Singapore through a merger with Malaya.\n\nThe tenure of Lim Yew Hock as Chief Minister, who succeeded Labour Front's David Marshall after his resignation in 1957, saw scant improvement to living conditions and unpopular tough measures on protesting unions. Lim's government also saw corruption during his tenure, and until the term expiry for Labour Front, all ten elected MPs had resigned from the party due to credibility. These resignations saw the formation of three parties; in 1957, David Marshall founded the [[Workers' Party (Singapore)|Workers' Party]] (one of the successful opposition parties of Singapore); in 1958, the [[Singapore People's Alliance]] (founded by Lim) and in 1959, the [[Citizens' Party (Singapore)|Citizens' Party]].\n\nSPA attempted to fight the record of the PAP administration in the [[City Council of Singapore]] with charges of corruptly appointing its supporters to fill up posts in the City Council, as well as raising concerns over the tenders of some Council contracts. The SPA even went as far as setting up a Commission of Inquiry in April 1959 to investigate whether there had been \u201cirregularities or improprieties\u201d in the working of the City Council. The inquiry, however, failed to reveal anything suspicious against the City Council and the hearings were adjourned indefinitely.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2019-04-08_145822.html |title=1959 Legislative Assembly general election |date=September 2018 |work=[[National Library Board]] |accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref><ref>[http://www.singapore-elections.com/general-election/1959/] singapore-elections.com</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2019-04-08_145822.html |title=1959 Legislative Assembly general election |date=September 2018 |work=[[National Library Board]] |accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nA new Party, Liberal Socialist Party (LSP) was formed by a merger of the [[Progressive Party (Singapore)|Progressive Party]] and the [[Democratic Party (Singapore)|Democratic Party]]. The Progressive Party which had won the [[1948 Singaporean general election|1948]] and [[1951 Singaporean general election|1951 elections]] (but lost to Labour Front in the [[1955 Singaporean general election|1955 elections]]) had already fallen out of favour as it was perceived by much of the electorate by working for reform too slowly.\n\nThe Alliance was a coalition comprising the Singapore branch of three political parties from Malaya, namely the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), the [[Malaysian Chinese Association|Malayan Chinese Association]] (MCA) and the [[Malaysian Indian Congress|Malayan Indian Congress]] (MIC), which they ran on raising the standards of living as well as to strengthen economic ties between Singapore and Malaya. As their parent parties were the ruling coalition in Malaya under [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], the Alliance promised voters that it could work for an early merger if voted into power as they knew \u201cexactly\u201d what their Malayan counterparts wanted. \n\nThe [[Malay Union]] which ran together with UMNO and MCA in the 1955 election, had been expelled from their alliance for putting up a candidate in the 1957 Cairnhill by-election.\n\nThe current opposition party, [[People's Action Party]], announced to contest 51 seats in the election; they released their election manifesto entitled '''The Tasks Ahead''', and outlined the party\u2019s five-year plan to address acute problems faced by Singapore. It called for a series of policies and programmes such as the provision of low-cost housing, the strengthening of education, as well as the development of industries thus improving employment opportunities for the local population. These were in addition to the goal of attaining independence for Singapore through a merger with the Federation of Malaya.\n\nThe PAP campaigned against corruption under the Lim Yew Hock government, and all party members and candidates wore a distinctive outfit of white shirts and pants (which is still the uniform of PAP candidates as of today) to represent \"cleanliness\" in government. SPA attempted to portray the PAP as a party being controlled by the communists, and such claims were repeated by Liberal Socialists and UMNO. Lee Kuan Yew brushed off the claims, describing them as \u201csilly\u201d, \u201cblabbering\u201d and \u201clies\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2019-04-08_145822.html|title=1959 Legislative Assembly general election |date=September 2018 |work=[[National Library Board]] |accessdate=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|31 March||Dissolution of 1st Legislative Assembly\n|-\n|25 April||Nomination Day\n|-\n|30 May|| Polling Day\n|-\n|5 June||Inauguration of the Cabinet with [[Lee Kuan Yew]] as inaugural Prime Minister\n|-\n|1 July||Opening of 2nd Legislative Assembly \n|}\n\n==Changes to electoral boundaries==\nThe 51 seats of the Legislative Assembly were elected from [[List of Singaporean electoral divisions (1959\u201363)|single-member constituencies]], with an increase of 26 seats in this election.

{"title_page": "Income shares", "text_new": "An '''income shares''' formula is used by many states to establish the [[child support]] amount of each child rather than what it actually costs to raise a child. Income shares tables calculating child support are not based directly on actual spending on children but rather on indirect estimates of child costs. Income shares model depend on that a child receive the same proportion of parental income and also it assumes that child costs reflect the spending necessary to restore a family's standard of living back to what it was prior to the divorce or having a child. It is very reasonable for the children who their parents divorced. It is consistent with the Uniform Marriage and Divorce Act.
