Since the middle ages the fortress was the namesake and centre of the main fief and later main county of [[Akershus]], which was originally one of Norway's four main regions and which included most of [[Eastern Norway]]. The fortress itself was located within Akershus main county until 1919, and also within the smaller Akershus sub county until 1842.\n\nThe castle has also been used as a military base, a prison and is currently the temporary [[Office of the Prime Minister (Norway)|office]] of the [[Prime Minister of Norway|Prime minister of Norway]].<ref>https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/smk/kontakt/id883/</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nIt is not known exactly when the construction of the [[List of Norwegian Fortresses|castle]] started but it is believed that it took place around the late 1290s, by [[Haakon V of Norway|King Haakon&nbsp;V]], replacing [[T\u00f8nsberg Fortress|T\u00f8nsberg]] as one of the two most important Norwegian castles of the period (the other being [[B\u00e5hus Fortress|B\u00e5hus]]). It was constructed in response to the Norwegian nobleman, Earl [[Alv Erlingsson]] of [[Sarpsborg]]\u2019s earlier attack on Oslo that occurred in 1287. In the aftermath of the attack, it became clear that the city\u2019s existing defences weren\u2019t effective and therefore, a stronger defensive centre was needed.\n\nThe castle is mentioned in written sources for the first time in 1300 in a letter from King Haakon to a church in Oslo. However, the letter does not mention how far the construction of the castle had progressed by then.\n\nThe fortress has successfully survived all sieges, primarily by [[Sweden|Swedish]] forces, including those by forces led by [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] in 1716.\n\n==Military use==\n=== The Middle Ages ===\nThe fortress was first used in battle in 1308, when it was besieged by the Swedish duke [[Eric, Duke of S\u00f6dermanland|Eric]] of [[S\u00f6dermanland]], whose brother won the Swedish throne in 1309. The siege was eventually broken by a local Norwegian army in a battle. (This battle forms a major part of the plot of [[Sigrid Undset]]'s historical novel ''In the Wilderness'', the third volume of her tetralogy ''[[The Master of Hestviken]]''.)\n\n=== Renaissance and Denmark-Norway ===\nIn 1449-1450 the castle was besieged again, this time by the Swedish king [[Charles VIII of Sweden|Karl Knutsson Bonde]], but he had to lift the siege after a while. The castle was not besieged again until 1502 when Scottish soldiers in the service of the Danish king besieged the castle in order to regain it from the hands of the Norwegian nobleman [[Knut Alvsson]].\n\nAkershus was besieged yet again in 1523, this time by Swedish soldiers but Oslo\u2019s inhabitants, at the command of Hans Mule, burned down their houses in an attempt to drive them out and the Swedes retreated after a short period.<ref>https://nbl.snl.no/Hans_Mule</ref> King Christian II besieged the castle from 1531 to 1532 but the siege was lifted by forces from Denmark and L\u00fcbeck. After this siege the castle was improved and strengthened.\n\nIn 1567, during the [[Northern Seven Years' War]], the castle was besieged once more by Swedish forces, but the Danish king's lord lieutenant, [[Christen Munk]], responded by [[Scorched earth|burning down the city]] in order to deprive the attackers themselves of the means of receiving supplies, and eventually the Swedes retreated.\n\nThe immediate proximity of the sea was a key feature, for [[navy|naval power]] was a vital [[military]] [[force]] as the majority of Norwegian commerce in that period was by sea. The fortress was strategically important for the capital, and therefore, [[Norway]] as well. Whoever controlled Akershus fortress ruled Norway.\n\n=== World War II ===\n[[File:German surrender of Akershus Fortress.jpg|thumb|left|The German garnison's commander Major {{Interlanguage link|Josef Nichterlein|no}} and his aide Captain Johannes Hamel handing the fortress over to the Norwegian resistance movement's [[Terje Rollem]] (May 11, 1945)]]\n\nThe fortress has never successfully been [[besiege]]d by a foreign enemy. However it surrendered without combat to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1940 when the Norwegian government evacuated the capital in the face of the unprovoked German assault on [[Denmark]] and Norway (see [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung]]).\n\nDuring World War II, people were executed here by the German occupiers, including members of the [[Pelle group]].

It was the last hurricane of the [[1916 Atlantic hurricane season]], forming as a [[tropical depression]] near [[Jamaica]] on October&nbsp;9 and moved slowly southwest and west, taking an unusual track for storms in October. Intensification was initially slow, but proceeded in earnest after October&nbsp;11 as the depression strengthened into a [[tropical storm]] and then a hurricane. It passed over the [[Swan Islands, Honduras|Swan Islands]] before moving ashore the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] on October&nbsp;15 near the border between the [[British Honduras]] and [[Mexico]]. Plantains and coconuts in the British Honduras sustained harsh losses. Twenty people were killed following the loss of a ship in the western Caribbean. The tropical cyclone weakened as it moved across the peninsula and curved north into the Gulf of Mexico on October&nbsp;16.\n\nThe hurricane restrengthened as it accelerated towards the [[U.S. Gulf Coast]], reaching a peak with winds of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) shortly before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Pensacola, Florida]], on the morning of October&nbsp;18. Records for extreme wind velocities were set in Pensacola and in [[Mobile, Alabama]], where gusts above {{cvt|120|mph|km/h}} were recorded. Two people were killed in [[Alabama]]. However, the storm's quick movement into the coast reduced the associated storm surge and rainfall, lessening the damage wrought by the hurricane. Total property damage in the Pensacola area amounted to approximately $100,000.{{#tag:ref|All monetary values are in 1916&nbsp;[[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise indicated.|group=nb|name=money}} In [[Louisiana]], the storm's rainfall was beneficial for crops struggling from a concurrent [[drought]]. After moving inland, the storm weakened and merged with another [[low-pressure area|area of low pressure]] near the [[Great Lakes]] on October&nbsp;19. The resulting storm produced gusty winds over much of the [[Eastern United States]] and was blamed for the loss of 49&nbsp;lives on [[Lake Erie]] in what became known as [[Black Friday (1916)|Black Friday]].\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|1916 Atlantic hurricane 14 track.png|alt=Map of the track and intensity of the storm, beginning in the Caribbean Sea and curving into the Gulf of Mexico before tracking over the United States}}\nIn the wake of an [[1916 Virgin Islands hurricane|earlier hurricane over the Virgin Islands]], lowered [[barometric pressure|air pressures]] prevailed over the [[Caribbean Sea]] in mid-October.

It was the last hurricane of the [[1916 Atlantic hurricane season]], forming as a [[tropical depression]] near [[Jamaica]] on October&nbsp;9 and moved slowly southwest and west, taking an unusual track for storms in October. Intensification was initially slow, but proceeded in earnest after October&nbsp;11 as the depression strengthened into a [[tropical storm]] and then a hurricane. It passed over the [[Swan Islands, Honduras|Swan Islands]] before moving ashore the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]] on October&nbsp;15 near the border between the [[British Honduras]] and [[Mexico]]. Plantains and coconuts in the British Honduras sustained harsh losses. Twenty people were killed following the loss of a ship in the western Caribbean. The tropical cyclone weakened as it moved across the peninsula and curved north into the Gulf of Mexico on October&nbsp;16.\n\nThe hurricane restrengthened as it accelerated towards the [[U.S. Gulf Coast]], reaching a peak with winds of 110&nbsp;mph (175&nbsp;km/h) shortly before making [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]] near [[Pensacola, Florida]], on the morning of October&nbsp;18. Records for extreme wind velocities were set in Pensacola and in [[Mobile, Alabama]], where gusts above {{cvt|120|mph|km/h}} were recorded. Two people were killed in [[Alabama]]. However, the storm's quick movement into the coast reduced the associated storm surge and rainfall, lessening the damage wrought by the hurricane. Total property damage in the Pensacola area amounted to approximately $100,000.{{#tag:ref|All monetary values are in 1916&nbsp;[[United States dollar]]s unless otherwise indicated.|group=nb|name=money}} In [[Louisiana]], the storm's rainfall was beneficial for crops struggling from a concurrent [[drought]]. After moving inland, the storm weakened and merged with another [[low-pressure area|area of low pressure]] near the [[Great Lakes]] on October&nbsp;19. The resulting storm produced gusty winds over much of the [[Eastern United States]] and was blamed for the loss of 49&nbsp;lives on [[Lake Erie]] in what became known as [[Black Friday (1916)|Black Friday]].\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{Storm path|1916 Atlantic hurricane 14 track.png|alt=Map of the track and intensity of the storm, beginning in the Caribbean Sea and curving into the Gulf of Mexico before tracking over the United States}}\nIn the wake of an [[1916 Virgin Islands hurricane|earlier hurricane over the Virgin Islands]], lowered [[barometric pressure|air pressures]] prevailed over the [[Caribbean Sea]] in mid-October.

These riboswitches are structurally related to [[cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitch]]es (see also \"cyclic di-GMP\" below).\n* ''[[YdaO/yuaA leader|cyclic di-AMP riboswitch]]es'' (also called ''ydaO/yuaA'') bind the signaling molecule [[cyclic di-AMP]].\n* ''cyclic di-GMP riboswitches'' bind the signaling molecule [[cyclic di-GMP]] in order to regulate a variety of genes controlled by this second messenger.  Two classes of cyclic di-GMP riboswitches are known: [[cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitch]]es and [[cyclic di-GMP-II riboswitch]]es.  These classes do not appear to be structurally related.\n* ''[[crcB RNA motif|fluoride riboswitches]]'' sense fluoride ions, and function in surviving high levels of [[fluoride]].\n* ''[[FMN riboswitch]]'' (also ''RFN-element'') binds [[flavin mononucleotide]] (FMN) to regulate [[riboflavin]] [[biosynthesis]] and transport.\n* ''[[GlmS glucosamine-6-phosphate activated ribozyme|glmS riboswitch]]'', which is a ribozyme that cleaves itself when there is a sufficient concentration of [[Glucosamine#Biochemistry|glucosamine-6-phosphate]].\n* ''Glutamine riboswitches'' bind [[glutamine]] to regulate genes involved in glutamine and [[nitrogen]] metabolism, as well as short peptides of unknown function.  Two classes of glutamine riboswitches are known: the ''[[glnA RNA motif]]'' and ''[[Downstream-peptide motif]]''.  These classes are believed to be structurally related (see discussions in those articles).\n* ''[[Glycine riboswitch]]'' binds glycine to regulate glycine metabolism genes, including the use of glycine as an energy source.  Previous to 2012, this riboswitch was thought to be the only that exhibits [[cooperative binding]], as it contains contiguous dual aptamers. Though no longer shown to be cooperative, the cause of dual aptamers still remains ambiguous.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherman EM, Esquiaqui J, Elsayed G, Ye JD | title = An energetically beneficial leader-linker interaction abolishes ligand-binding cooperativity in glycine riboswitches | journal = RNA | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 496\u2013507 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22279151 | pmc = 3285937 | doi = 10.1261/rna.031286.111 }}</ref>\n* ''[[Lysine riboswitch]]'' (also ''L-box'') binds [[lysine]] to regulate lysine biosynthesis, [[catabolism]] and transport.\n* ''[[YybP-ykoY leader|manganese riboswitches]]'' bind [[manganese]] [[ion]]s.\n* ''[[NiCo riboswitch]]es'' bind the metal ions [[nickel]] and [[cobalt]].\n* ''PreQ1 riboswitches'' bind pre-queuosine<sub>1</sub>, to regulate genes involved in the synthesis or transport of this precursor to [[queuosine]].  Three entirely distinct classes of PreQ1 riboswitches are known: [[PreQ1 riboswitch|PreQ1-I riboswitches]], [[PreQ1-II riboswitch]]es and [[PreQ1-III riboswitch]]es.  The binding domain of PreQ1-I riboswitches are unusually small among naturally occurring riboswitches.  PreQ1-II riboswitches, which are only found in certain species in the genera ''Streptococcus'' and ''Lactococcus'', have a completely different structure, and are larger, as are PreQ1-III riboswitches.\n* ''[[Purine riboswitch]]es'' binds [[purine]]s to regulate purine metabolism and transport.  Different forms of the purine riboswitch bind [[guanine]] (a form originally known as the ''G-box'') or [[adenine]].  The specificity for either guanine or adenine depends completely upon Watson-Crick interactions with a single [[pyrimidine]] in the riboswitch at position Y74. In the guanine riboswitch this residue is always a [[cytosine]] (i.e. C74), in the adenine residue it is always a [[uracil]] (i.e. U74).  Homologous types of purine riboswitches bind [[deoxyguanosine]], but have more significant differences than a single nucleotide mutation.\n* ''[[SAH riboswitch]]es'' bind [[S-adenosylhomocysteine]] to regulate genes involved in recycling this metabolite that is produced when [[S-adenosylmethionine]] is used in methylation reactions.\n* ''SAM riboswitches'' bind [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) to regulate [[methionine]] and SAM biosynthesis and transport. Three distinct SAM riboswitches are known: ''[[SAM riboswitch (S box leader)|SAM-I]]'' (originally called ''S-box''), ''[[SAM-II riboswitch|SAM-II]]'' and the ''[[SMK box riboswitch|S<sub>MK</sub> box riboswitch]]''.  SAM-I is widespread in bacteria, but SAM-II is found only in alpha-, beta- and a few gamma-[[proteobacteria]]. The S<sub>MK</sub> box riboswitch is found only in the order [[Lactobacillales]].  These three varieties of riboswitch have no obvious similarities in terms of sequence or structure.  A fourth variety, [[SAM-IV riboswitch]]es, appears to have a similar ligand-binding core to that of SAM-I riboswitches, but in the context of a distinct scaffold.\n* ''[[SAM-SAH riboswitch]]es'' bind both SAM and SAH with similar affinities.  Since they are always found in a position to regulate genes encoding [[methionine adenosyltransferase]], it was proposed that only their binding to SAM is physiologically relevant.\n* ''[[Tetrahydrofolate riboswitch]]es'' bind [[tetrahydrofolate]] to regulate synthesis and transport genes.\n* ''[[TPP riboswitch]]es'' (also THI-box) binds [[thiamin pyrophosphate]] (TPP) to regulate [[thiamin]] biosynthesis and transport, as well as transport of similar metabolites.

These riboswitches are structurally related to [[cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitch]]es (see also \"cyclic di-GMP\" below).\n* ''[[YdaO/yuaA leader|cyclic di-AMP riboswitch]]es'' (also called ''ydaO/yuaA'') bind the signaling molecule [[cyclic di-AMP]].\n* ''cyclic di-GMP riboswitches'' bind the signaling molecule [[cyclic di-GMP]] in order to regulate a variety of genes controlled by this second messenger.  Two classes of cyclic di-GMP riboswitches are known: [[cyclic di-GMP-I riboswitch]]es and [[cyclic di-GMP-II riboswitch]]es.  These classes do not appear to be structurally related.\n* ''[[crcB RNA motif|fluoride riboswitches]]'' sense fluoride ions, and function in surviving high levels of [[fluoride]].\n* ''[[FMN riboswitch]]'' (also ''RFN-element'') binds [[flavin mononucleotide]] (FMN) to regulate [[riboflavin]] [[biosynthesis]] and transport.\n* ''[[GlmS glucosamine-6-phosphate activated ribozyme|glmS riboswitch]]'', which is a ribozyme that cleaves itself when there is a sufficient concentration of [[Glucosamine#Biochemistry|glucosamine-6-phosphate]].\n* ''Glutamine riboswitches'' bind [[glutamine]] to regulate genes involved in glutamine and [[nitrogen]] metabolism, as well as short peptides of unknown function.  Two classes of glutamine riboswitches are known: the ''[[glnA RNA motif]]'' and ''[[Downstream-peptide motif]]''.  These classes are believed to be structurally related (see discussions in those articles).\n* ''[[Glycine riboswitch]]'' binds glycine to regulate glycine metabolism genes, including the use of glycine as an energy source.  Previous to 2012, this riboswitch was thought to be the only that exhibits [[cooperative binding]], as it contains contiguous dual aptamers. Though no longer shown to be cooperative, the cause of dual aptamers still remains ambiguous.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Sherman EM, Esquiaqui J, Elsayed G, Ye JD | title = An energetically beneficial leader-linker interaction abolishes ligand-binding cooperativity in glycine riboswitches | journal = RNA | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 496\u2013507 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22279151 | pmc = 3285937 | doi = 10.1261/rna.031286.111 }}</ref>\n* ''[[Lysine riboswitch]]'' (also ''L-box'') binds [[lysine]] to regulate lysine biosynthesis, [[catabolism]] and transport.\n* ''[[YybP-ykoY leader|manganese riboswitches]]'' bind [[manganese]] [[ion]]s.\n* ''[[NiCo riboswitch]]es'' bind the metal ions [[nickel]] and [[cobalt]].\n* ''PreQ1 riboswitches'' bind pre-queuosine<sub>1</sub>, to regulate genes involved in the synthesis or transport of this precursor to [[queuosine]].  Three entirely distinct classes of PreQ1 riboswitches are known: [[PreQ1 riboswitch|PreQ1-I riboswitches]], [[PreQ1-II riboswitch]]es and [[PreQ1-III riboswitch]]es.  The binding domain of PreQ1-I riboswitches are unusually small among naturally occurring riboswitches.  PreQ1-II riboswitches, which are only found in certain species in the genera ''Streptococcus'' and ''Lactococcus'', have a completely different structure, and are larger, as are PreQ1-III riboswitches.\n* ''[[Purine riboswitch]]es'' binds [[purine]]s to regulate purine metabolism and transport.  Different forms of the purine riboswitch bind [[guanine]] (a form originally known as the ''G-box'') or [[adenine]].  The specificity for either guanine or adenine depends completely upon Watson-Crick interactions with a single [[pyrimidine]] in the riboswitch at position Y74. In the guanine riboswitch this residue is always a [[cytosine]] (i.e. C74), in the adenine residue it is always a [[uracil]] (i.e. U74).  Homologous types of purine riboswitches bind [[deoxyguanosine]], but have more significant differences than a single nucleotide mutation.\n* ''[[SAH riboswitch]]es'' bind [[S-adenosylhomocysteine]] to regulate genes involved in recycling this metabolite that is produced when [[S-adenosylmethionine]] is used in methylation reactions.\n* ''SAM riboswitches'' bind [[S-adenosyl methionine]] (SAM) to regulate [[methionine]] and SAM biosynthesis and transport. Three distinct SAM riboswitches are known: ''[[SAM riboswitch (S box leader)|SAM-I]]'' (originally called ''S-box''), ''[[SAM-II riboswitch|SAM-II]]'' and the ''[[SMK box riboswitch|S<sub>MK</sub> box riboswitch]]''.  SAM-I is widespread in bacteria, but SAM-II is found only in alpha-, beta- and a few gamma-[[proteobacteria]]. The S<sub>MK</sub> box riboswitch is found only in the order [[Lactobacillales]].  These three varieties of riboswitch have no obvious similarities in terms of sequence or structure.  A fourth variety, [[SAM-IV riboswitch]]es, appears to have a similar ligand-binding core to that of SAM-I riboswitches, but in the context of a distinct scaffold.\n* ''[[SAM-SAH riboswitch]]es'' bind both SAM and SAH with similar affinities.  Since they are always found in a position to regulate genes encoding [[methionine adenosyltransferase]], it was proposed that only their binding to SAM is physiologically relevant.\n* ''[[Tetrahydrofolate riboswitch]]es'' bind [[tetrahydrofolate]] to regulate synthesis and transport genes.\n* ''[[TPP riboswitch]]es'' (also THI-box) binds [[thiamin pyrophosphate]] (TPP) to regulate [[thiamin]] biosynthesis and transport, as well as transport of similar metabolites. It is the only riboswitch found so far in eukaryotes.<ref>Switching the light on plant riboswitches.

Riboswitch candidates are also consistently located in the 5' UTRs of protein-coding genes, and these genes are suggestive of metabolite binding, as these are also features of most known riboswitches.  Hypothesized riboswitch candidates highly consistent with the preceding criteria are as follows: [[crcB RNA Motif]], [[manA RNA motif]], [[pfl RNA motif]], [[ydaO/yuaA leader]], [[yjdF RNA motif]], [[ykkC-yxkD leader]] (and related ykkC-III RNA motif) and the [[yybP-ykoY leader]].

His poetry both described the horrors of the trenches and satirised the patriotic pretensions of those who, in Sassoon's view, were responsible for a [[jingoism]]-fuelled war.<ref>''Siegfried Sassoon: The Making of a War Poet'', Jean Moorcroft Wilson (Duckworth, 2004).</ref> Sassoon became a focal point for dissent within the armed forces when he made a lone protest against the continuation of the war in his \"Soldier's Declaration\" of 1917, culminating in his admission to a military psychiatric hospital; this resulted in his forming a friendship with [[Wilfred Owen]], who was greatly influenced by him.  Sassoon later won acclaim for his prose work, notably his three-volume fictionalised autobiography, collectively known as the \"[[Sherston trilogy]]\".\n\n==Early life==\nSiegfried Sassoon was born to a Jewish father and an [[Anglo-Catholic]] mother, and grew up in the neo-gothic mansion named \"Weirleigh\" (after its builder, [[Harrison Weir]]), in [[Matfield]], Kent.<ref name=KSC10122010>{{Cite news|title=War poet was tasty with bat |first=Frank |last=Chapman |newspaper=Kent and Sussex Courier |date=10 December 2010 |page=42}}</ref> His father, Alfred Ezra Sassoon (1861\u20131895), son of [[Sassoon David Sassoon]], was a member of the wealthy [[Baghdadi Jews|Baghdadi Jewish]] [[Sassoon family|Sassoon merchant family]]. For marrying outside the faith, Alfred was disinherited. Siegfried's mother, [[Theresa Thornycroft|Theresa]], belonged to the [[Thornycroft family]], sculptors responsible for many of the best-known statues in London\u2014her brother was Sir [[Hamo Thornycroft]]. There was no German ancestry in Siegfried's family; his mother named him Siegfried because of her love of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s operas. His middle name, Loraine, was the surname of a clergyman with whom she was friendly.\n\nSiegfried was the second of three sons, the others being Michael and Hamo. When he was four years old his parents separated. During his father's weekly visits to the boys, Theresa locked herself in the drawing-room. In 1895 Alfred Sassoon died of [[tuberculosis]].\n\n[[File:First World War 1914 - 1918- War Poets HU50506.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sassoon (front) with his brother Hamo and other students on the morning after a college [[May Ball]] at [[Cambridge University]] in 1906]]\nSassoon was educated at the [[New Beacon School]], [[Sevenoaks]], Kent; at [[Marlborough College]], Wiltshire; and at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where from 1905 to 1907 he read history. He went down from Cambridge without a degree and spent the next few years hunting, playing cricket and writing verse: some he published privately. Since his father had been disinherited from the Sassoon fortune for marrying a non-Jew, Siegfried had only a small private income that allowed him to live modestly without having to earn a living (however, he would later be left a generous legacy by an aunt, [[Rachel Beer]], allowing him to buy the great estate of Heytesbury House in Wiltshire.<ref>[http://siegfried-sassoon.firstworldwarrelics.co.uk/html/heytesbury.html Heytesbury House]</ref>) His first published success, ''The Daffodil Murderer'' (1913), was a parody of [[John Masefield]]'s ''[[The Everlasting Mercy]]''. [[Robert Graves]], in ''[[Good-Bye to All That]]'' describes it as a \"parody of Masefield which, midway through, had forgotten to be a parody and turned into rather good Masefield.\"\n\nSassoon expressed his opinions on the political situation before the onset of the First World War thus\u2014\"France was a lady, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a bear, and performing in the county [[cricket]] team was much more important than either of them\". Sassoon wanted to play for [[Kent County Cricket Club]]; the Marchant family were neighbours, and [[Frank Marchant]] was captain of the county side between 1890 and 1897. Siegfried often turned out for Bluemantles at the [[Nevill Ground]], Tunbridge Wells, where he sometimes played alongside [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. He had also played cricket for his house at Marlborough College, once taking 7 wickets for 18 runs. Although an enthusiast, Sassoon was not good enough to play for Kent, but he played cricket for Matfield village, and later for the Downside Abbey team, continuing into his seventies.<ref name=KSC10122010/><ref name=coldham>Coldham, James D (1954) [http://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketer/content/story/276146.html Siegfried Sassoon and cricket], ''[[The Cricketer]]'', June 1954.

He broke his arm badly in a riding accident and was put out of action before even leaving England, spending the spring of 1915 convalescing. ([[Rupert Brooke]], whom Sassoon had briefly met, died in April on the way to Gallipoli.) He was commissioned into the 3rd Battalion ([[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]]), [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], as a [[second lieutenant]] on 29 May 1915.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29175|page=5115|date=28 May 1915}}</ref> On 1 November his younger brother Hamo was killed in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]],<ref>{{cwgc|id=681993|name=Sassoon, Hamo}}</ref> and in the same month Siegfried was sent to the 1st Battalion in France. There he met [[Robert Graves]], and they became close friends. United by their poetic vocation, they often read and discussed each other's work. Though this did not have much perceptible influence on Graves' poetry, his views on what may be called 'gritty realism' profoundly affected Sassoon's concept of what constituted poetry. He soon became horrified by the realities of war, and the tone of his writing changed completely: where his early poems exhibit a [[Romanticism|Romantic]], dilettantish sweetness, his war poetry moves to an increasingly discordant music, intended to convey the ugly truths of the trenches to an audience hitherto lulled by patriotic propaganda. Details such as rotting corpses, mangled limbs, filth, cowardice and suicide are all trademarks of his work at this time, and this philosophy of 'no truth unfitting' had a significant effect on the movement towards [[Modernist]] poetry.\n\nSassoon's periods of duty on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] were marked by exceptionally brave actions, including the single-handed capture of a German trench in the [[Hindenburg Line]]. Armed with grenades, he scattered sixty German soldiers:<ref>Max Egremont, ''Siegfried Sassoon'' (2005), p. 103.</ref><blockquote>He went over with bombs in daylight, under covering fire from a couple of rifles, and scared away the occupants. A pointless feat, since instead of signalling for reinforcements, he sat down in the German trench and began reading a book of poems which he had brought with him. When he went back he did not even report. Colonel Stockwell, then in command, raged at him. The attack on [[Mametz Wood]] had been delayed for two hours because British patrols were still reported to be out. \"British patrols\" were Siegfried and his book of poems. \"I'd have got you a [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], if you'd only shown more sense,\" stormed Stockwell.<ref>Robert Graves, ''Goodbye to All That'' (London: Penguin, 1960), p. 174.</ref></blockquote>Sassoon's bravery was so inspiring that soldiers of his company said that they felt confident only when they were accompanied by him.<ref>Egremont, ''Siegfried Sassoon'' (2005), p. 99.</ref> He often went out on night-raids and bombing patrols and demonstrated ruthless efficiency as a company commander. Deepening depression at the horror and misery the soldiers were forced to endure produced in Sassoon a paradoxically manic courage, and he was nicknamed \"Mad Jack\" by his men for his near-suicidal exploits. On 27 July 1916 he was awarded the [[Military Cross]]; the citation read:\n\n{{quote|2nd Lt. Siegfried Lorraine{{sic}} Sassoon, 3rd (attd. 1st) Bn., R. W. Fus.\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry during a raid on the enemy's trenches. He remained for 1\u00bd hours under rifle and bomb fire collecting and bringing in our wounded. Owing to his courage and determination all the killed and wounded were brought in.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29684 |supp=y|page=7441|date=25 July 1916}}</ref>}}\n\nRobert Graves described Sassoon as engaging in suicidal feats of bravery. Sassoon was also later recommended for the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref name=ODNB>{{Cite ODNB |first=Rupert |last=Hart-Davis |title=Sassoon, Siegfried Loraine (1886\u20131967) |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35953 |access-date=9 July 2009 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35953}}</ref>\n\n===War opposition and Craiglockhart===\nDespite his decorations and reputation, in 1917 Sassoon decided to make a stand against the conduct of the war. One of the reasons for his violent anti-war feeling was the death of his friend [[David Cuthbert Thomas]], who appears as \"Dick Tiltwood\" in the [[Sherston trilogy]]. Sassoon would spend years trying to overcome his grief.\n\nIn August 1916, Sassoon arrived at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], which was used as a hospital for convalescing officers, with a case of gastric fever. He wrote: ''To be lying in a littel white-walled room, looking through the window on to a College lawn, was for the first few days very much like a paradise.'' Graves ended up at Somerville as well. ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to him in 1917.\n\nAt the end of a spell of convalescent leave, Sassoon declined to return to duty; instead, encouraged by pacifist friends such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], he sent a letter to his commanding officer entitled ''[[s:Finished with the War: A Soldier\u2019s Declaration|Finished with the War: A Soldier\u2019s Declaration]]''. Forwarded to the press and read out in the House of Commons by a sympathetic member of Parliament, the letter was seen by some as treasonous (\"I am making this statement as an act of wilful defiance of military authority\") or at best as condemning the war government's motives (\"I believe that the war upon which I entered as a war of defence and liberation has now become a war of aggression and conquest\"<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/887751--war-resisters-also-deserve-a-memorial|title=War resisters also deserve a memorial |author=Peter Smollett |date=9 November 2010|work=Toronto Star |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>). Rather than [[court-martial]] Sassoon, the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]], [[Ian Macpherson, 1st Baron Strathcarron|Ian Macpherson]], decided that he was unfit for service and had him sent to [[Craiglockhart War Hospital]] near [[Edinburgh]], where he was officially treated for [[neurasthenia]] (\"[[shell shock]]\").<ref name=ODNB />\n\nFor many years it had been thought that, before declining to return to active service, Sassoon had thrown his Military Cross into the [[River Mersey]] at [[Formby]] beach. According to his description of this incident in ''[[Memoirs of an Infantry Officer]]'' he did not do this as a symbolic rejection of militaristic values, but simply out of the need to perform some destructive act in catharsis of the black mood which was afflicting him; his account states that one of his pre-war sporting trophies, had he had one to hand, would have served his purpose equally well. In fact, the MC was discovered after the death of Sassoon's only son, George, in the home of Sassoon's ex-wife, which George had inherited. The Cross subsequently became the subject of a dispute among Sassoon's heirs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12779481.Family_in_row_over_Sassoon_war_medal_sale/|title=Family in row over Sassoon war medal sale|website=The Herald|location=Glasgow|access-date=14 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt Craiglockhart, Sassoon met [[Wilfred Owen]], a fellow poet who would eventually exceed him in fame. It was thanks to Sassoon that Owen persevered in his ambition to write better poetry. A manuscript copy of Owen's ''[[Anthem for Doomed Youth]]'' containing Sassoon's handwritten amendments survives as testimony to the extent of his influence and is currently on display at London's [[Imperial War Museum]]. Sassoon became to Owen \"[[John Keats|Keats]] and Christ and Elijah\"; surviving documents demonstrate clearly the depth of Owen's love and admiration for him. Both men returned to active service in France, but Owen was killed in 1918, a week before Armistice. Sassoon, despite all this, was promoted to [[first lieutenant|lieutenant]], and having spent some time out of danger in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], eventually returned to the Front. On 13 July 1918, Sassoon was almost immediately wounded again\u2014by [[friendly fire]] when he was shot in the head by a fellow British soldier who had mistaken him for a German near [[Arras]], France. As a result, he spent the remainder of the war in Britain. By this time he had been promoted to acting [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]. He relinquished his commission on health grounds on 12 March 1919, but was allowed to retain the rank of captain.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31221 |supp=y|page=3269|date=7 March 1919}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Sassoon was instrumental in bringing Owen's work to the attention of a wider audience. Their friendship is the subject of [[Stephen MacDonald]]'s play, ''[[Not About Heroes]]''.\n\n==Post-war life==\n[[File:Green plaque Siegfried Sassoon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue plaque|Green plaque]] on the site of Sassoon's former home in Tufton Street, [[Westminster]], London]]\n[[File:Quiller-couch letter to Sassoon.jpg|thumb|upright|A handwritten letter to Sassoon from [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]], about the possibility of Quiller-Couch writing for [[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|''The Daily Herald'']].]]\n\n===Editor and novelist===\nHaving lived for a period at [[Oxford]], where he spent more time visiting literary friends than studying, he dabbled briefly in the politics of the Labour movement, and in 1919 took up a post as literary editor of the socialist ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]''.  He lived at 54 Tufton Street, [[Westminster]] from 1919 to 1925; the house is no longer standing, but the location of his former home is marked by a memorial plaque.<ref>[http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ City of Westminster green plaques.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |date=16 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his period at the ''Herald'', Sassoon was responsible for employing several eminent names as reviewers, including [[E. M. Forster]] and [[Charlotte Mew]], and commissioned original material from \"names\" like [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[Osbert Sitwell]]. His artistic interests extended to music.  While at Oxford he was introduced to the young [[William Walton]], to whom he became a friend and patron.  Walton later dedicated his ''[[Portsmouth Point (Walton)|Portsmouth Point]]'' overture to Sassoon in recognition of his financial assistance and moral support.\n\nSassoon later embarked on a lecture tour of the USA, as well as travelling in Europe and throughout Britain. He acquired a car, a gift from the publisher [[Frankie Schuster]], and became renowned among his friends for his lack of driving skill, but this did not prevent him making full use of the mobility it gave him.\n\nSassoon was a great admirer of the Welsh poet [[Henry Vaughan]]. On a visit to Wales in 1923, he paid a pilgrimage to Vaughan's grave at [[Llansantffraed]], [[Powys]], and there wrote one of his best-known peacetime poems, \"At the Grave of Henry Vaughan\". The deaths within a short space of time of three of his closest friends \u2013 [[Edmund Gosse]], [[Thomas Hardy]] and Frankie Schuster \u2013 came as another serious setback to his personal happiness.\n\nAt the same time, Sassoon was preparing to take a new direction.  While in America, he had experimented with a novel. In 1928, he branched out into prose, with ''[[Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man]]'', the anonymously-published first volume of a fictionalised autobiography, which was almost immediately accepted as a classic, bringing its author new fame as a humorous writer. The book won the 1928 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize|James Tait Black Award]] for fiction. Sassoon followed it with ''[[Memoirs of an Infantry Officer]]'' (1930) and ''[[Sherston's Progress]]'' (1936). In later years, he revisited his youth and early manhood with three volumes of genuine autobiography, which were also widely acclaimed.  These were ''The Old Century'', ''The Weald of Youth'' and ''Siegfried's Journey''.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:SiegfriedSassoonGraveMells(GrahamAllard)May2006.jpg|upright|thumb|Siegfried Sassoon's gravestone in [[Mells, Somerset|Mells]] churchyard]]\n[[File:Siegfried Sassoon 23 Campden Hill Square blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 23 Campden Hill Square, London]]\n\n===Affairs===\nSassoon, having matured greatly as a result of his military service, continued to seek emotional fulfilment, initially in a succession of love affairs with men, including:\n*William Park \"Gabriel\" Atkin, the landscape architectural and figure painter, draftsman and illustrator<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Neil|title=Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the Present|url=https://archive.org/details/outofpastgayand00mill|url-access=registration|year=1995|page=[https://archive.org/details/outofpastgayand00mill/page/96 96]}}</ref>\n*[[Ivor Novello]], actor<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n*[[Glen Byam Shaw]], actor and Novello's former lover<ref name=\"Wilson2003\">{{cite book|author=Jean Moorcroft Wilson|title=Siegfried Sassoon: The Journey from the Trenches : a Biography (1918\u20131967)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO9KDzIYSZoC&pg=PR11|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-96713-6|pages=11\u2013}}</ref>\n*[[Prince Philipp of Hesse]], German aristocrat<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3593051/The-war-poets-long-peace.html|title=The war poet's long peace|author=John Gross|website=The Telegraph|date=22 April 2003|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref>\n*[[John Beverley Nichols|Beverley Nichols]], writer<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n*[[Stephen Tennant|the Hon.

The marriage led to the birth of a child, something which he had purportedly craved for a long time:\n*[[George Sassoon]] (1936\u20132006), who was married four times: firstly Stephanie Munro, at Inverness in 1955 (dissolved 1961); secondly Marguerite Dicks in 1961 (dissolved 1974); thirdly Susan Christian-Howard in 1975 (dissolved 1982); and lastly Alison Pulvertaft.\nGeorge became a scientist, linguist, and author, and was adored by Siegfried, who wrote several poems addressed to him. However, the marriage broke down after [[World War II|the Second World War]], Sassoon apparently unable to find a compromise between the solitude he enjoyed and the companionship he craved.\n\nSeparated from his wife in 1945, Sassoon lived in seclusion at [[Heytesbury]] in Wiltshire, although he maintained contact with a circle which included [[E. M. Forster|E M Forster]] and [[J. R. Ackerley|J R Ackerley]]. One of his closest friends was the cricketer, [[Dennis Silk]] who later became Warden (headmaster) of [[Radley College]]. He also formed a close friendship with Vivien Hancock, then headmistress of [[Greenways School]] at [[Ashton Gifford House|Ashton Gifford]], where his son George was a pupil. The relationship provoked Hester to make strong accusations against Hancock, who responded with the threat of legal action.{{Sfn|Wilson|2003|p=|pp=345\u20136}}\n\n===Religion===\nTowards the end of his life, Sassoon converted to Roman Catholicism. He had hoped that [[Ronald Knox]], a Roman Catholic priest and writer whom he admired, would instruct him in the faith, but Knox was too ill to do so.<ref>[http://www.catholicauthors.com/knox.html Catholic Authors \u2013 Ronald Knox]</ref> The priest Sebastian Moore was chosen to instruct him instead, and Sassoon was admitted to the faith at [[Downside Abbey]] in Somerset.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Fisher\n  | first = Deb\n  | title = Interview with Dom Sebastian Moore\n  | journal = Siegfried's Journal\n  | volume = 14\n  |date=July 2008\n  }}</ref> He also paid regular visits to the nuns at [[Stanbrook Abbey]], and the Abbey press printed commemorative editions of some of his poems.

His poetry both described the horrors of the trenches and satirised the patriotic pretensions of those who, in Sassoon's view, were responsible for a [[jingoism]]-fuelled war.<ref>''Siegfried Sassoon: The Making of a War Poet'', Jean Moorcroft Wilson (Duckworth, 2004).</ref> Sassoon became a focal point for dissent within the armed forces when he made a lone protest against the continuation of the war in his \"Soldier's Declaration\" of 1917, culminating in his admission to a military psychiatric hospital; this resulted in his forming a friendship with [[Wilfred Owen]], who was greatly influenced by him.  Sassoon later won acclaim for his prose work, notably his three-volume fictionalised autobiography, collectively known as the \"[[Sherston trilogy]]\".\n\n==Early life==\nSiegfried Sassoon was born to a Jewish father and an [[Anglo-Catholic]] mother, and grew up in the neo-gothic mansion named \"Weirleigh\" (after its builder, [[Harrison Weir]]), in [[Matfield]], Kent.<ref name=KSC10122010>{{Cite news|title=War poet was tasty with bat |first=Frank |last=Chapman |newspaper=Kent and Sussex Courier |date=10 December 2010 |page=42}}</ref> His father, Alfred Ezra Sassoon (1861\u20131895), son of [[Sassoon David Sassoon]], was a member of the wealthy [[Baghdadi Jews|Baghdadi Jewish]] [[Sassoon family|Sassoon merchant family]]. For marrying outside the faith, Alfred was disinherited. Siegfried's mother, [[Theresa Thornycroft|Theresa]], belonged to the [[Thornycroft family]], sculptors responsible for many of the best-known statues in London\u2014her brother was Sir [[Hamo Thornycroft]]. There was no German ancestry in Siegfried's family; his mother named him Siegfried because of her love of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s operas. His middle name, Loraine, was the surname of a clergyman with whom she was friendly.\n\nSiegfried was the second of three sons, the others being Michael and Hamo. When he was four years old his parents separated. During his father's weekly visits to the boys, Theresa locked herself in the drawing-room. In 1895 Alfred Sassoon died of [[tuberculosis]].\n\n[[File:First World War 1914 - 1918- War Poets HU50506.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sassoon (front) with his brother Hamo and other students on the morning after a college [[May Ball]] at [[Cambridge University]] in 1906]]\nSassoon was educated at the [[New Beacon School]], [[Sevenoaks]], Kent; at [[Marlborough College]], Wiltshire; and at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where from 1905 to 1907 he read history. He went down from Cambridge without a degree and spent the next few years hunting, playing cricket and writing verse: some he published privately. Since his father had been disinherited from the Sassoon fortune for marrying a non-Jew, Siegfried had only a small private income that allowed him to live modestly without having to earn a living (however, he would later be left a generous legacy by an aunt, [[Rachel Beer]], allowing him to buy the great estate of Heytesbury House in Wiltshire.<ref>[http://siegfried-sassoon.firstworldwarrelics.co.uk/html/heytesbury.html Heytesbury House]</ref>) His first published success, ''The Daffodil Murderer'' (1913), was a parody of [[John Masefield]]'s ''[[The Everlasting Mercy]]''. [[Robert Graves]], in ''[[Good-Bye to All That]]'' describes it as a \"parody of Masefield which, midway through, had forgotten to be a parody and turned into rather good Masefield.\"\n\nSassoon expressed his opinions on the political situation before the onset of the First World War thus\u2014\"France was a lady, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] was a bear, and performing in the county [[cricket]] team was much more important than either of them\". Sassoon wanted to play for [[Kent County Cricket Club]]; the Marchant family were neighbours, and [[Frank Marchant]] was captain of the county side between 1890 and 1897. Siegfried often turned out for Bluemantles at the [[Nevill Ground]], Tunbridge Wells, where he sometimes played alongside [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. He had also played cricket for his house at Marlborough College, once taking 7 wickets for 18 runs. Although an enthusiast, Sassoon was not good enough to play for Kent, but he played cricket for Matfield village, and later for the Downside Abbey team, continuing into his seventies.<ref name=KSC10122010/><ref name=coldham>Coldham, James D (1954) [http://www.espncricinfo.com/cricketer/content/story/276146.html Siegfried Sassoon and cricket], ''[[The Cricketer]]'', June 1954.

He broke his arm badly in a riding accident and was put out of action before even leaving England, spending the spring of 1915 convalescing. ([[Rupert Brooke]], whom Sassoon had briefly met, died in April on the way to Gallipoli.) He was commissioned into the 3rd Battalion ([[Special Reserve (militia)|Special Reserve]]), [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]], as a [[second lieutenant]] on 29 May 1915.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=29175|page=5115|date=28 May 1915}}</ref> On 1 November his younger brother Hamo was killed in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]],<ref>{{cwgc|id=681993|name=Sassoon, Hamo}}</ref> and in the same month Siegfried was sent to the 1st Battalion in France. There he met [[Robert Graves]], and they became close friends. United by their poetic vocation, they often read and discussed each other's work. Though this did not have much perceptible influence on Graves' poetry, his views on what may be called 'gritty realism' profoundly affected Sassoon's concept of what constituted poetry. He soon became horrified by the realities of war, and the tone of his writing changed completely: where his early poems exhibit a [[Romanticism|Romantic]], dilettantish sweetness, his war poetry moves to an increasingly discordant music, intended to convey the ugly truths of the trenches to an audience hitherto lulled by patriotic propaganda. Details such as rotting corpses, mangled limbs, filth, cowardice and suicide are all trademarks of his work at this time, and this philosophy of 'no truth unfitting' had a significant effect on the movement towards [[Modernist]] poetry.\n\nSassoon's periods of duty on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] were marked by exceptionally brave actions, including the single-handed capture of a German trench in the [[Hindenburg Line]]. Armed with grenades, he scattered sixty German soldiers:<ref>Max Egremont, ''Siegfried Sassoon'' (2005), p. 103.</ref><blockquote>He went over with bombs in daylight, under covering fire from a couple of rifles, and scared away the occupants. A pointless feat, since instead of signalling for reinforcements, he sat down in the German trench and began reading a book of poems which he had brought with him. When he went back he did not even report. Colonel Stockwell, then in command, raged at him. The attack on [[Mametz Wood]] had been delayed for two hours because British patrols were still reported to be out. \"British patrols\" were Siegfried and his book of poems. \"I'd have got you a [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], if you'd only shown more sense,\" stormed Stockwell.<ref>Robert Graves, ''Goodbye to All That'' (London: Penguin, 1960), p. 174.</ref></blockquote>Sassoon's bravery was so inspiring that soldiers of his company said that they felt confident only when they were accompanied by him.<ref>Egremont, ''Siegfried Sassoon'' (2005), p. 99.</ref> He often went out on night-raids and bombing patrols and demonstrated ruthless efficiency as a company commander. Deepening depression at the horror and misery the soldiers were forced to endure produced in Sassoon a paradoxically manic courage, and he was nicknamed \"Mad Jack\" by his men for his near-suicidal exploits. On 27 July 1916 he was awarded the [[Military Cross]]; the citation read:\n\n{{quote|2nd Lt. Siegfried Lorraine{{sic}} Sassoon, 3rd (attd. 1st) Bn., R. W.

Sassoon was also later recommended for the [[Victoria Cross]].<ref name=ODNB>{{Cite ODNB |first=Rupert |last=Hart-Davis |title=Sassoon, Siegfried Loraine (1886\u20131967) |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35953 |access-date=9 July 2009 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/35953}}</ref>\n\n===War opposition and Craiglockhart===\nDespite his decorations and reputation, in 1917 Sassoon decided to make a stand against the conduct of the war. One of the reasons for his violent anti-war feeling was the death of his friend [[David Cuthbert Thomas]], who appears as \"Dick Tiltwood\" in the [[Sherston trilogy]]. Sassoon would spend years trying to overcome his grief.\n\nIn August 1916, Sassoon arrived at [[Somerville College, Oxford]], which was used as a hospital for convalescing officers, with a case of gastric fever. He wrote: ''To be lying in a littel white-walled room, looking through the window on to a College lawn, was for the first few days very much like a paradise.'' Graves ended up at Somerville as well. ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to him in 1917.\n\nAt the end of a spell of convalescent leave, Sassoon declined to return to duty; instead, encouraged by pacifist friends such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], he sent a letter to his commanding officer entitled ''[[s:Finished with the War: A Soldier\u2019s Declaration|Finished with the War: A Soldier\u2019s Declaration]]''. Forwarded to the press and read out in the House of Commons by a sympathetic member of Parliament, the letter was seen by some as treasonous (\"I am making this statement as an act of wilful defiance of military authority\") or at best as condemning the war government's motives (\"I believe that the war upon which I entered as a war of defence and liberation has now become a war of aggression and conquest\"<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorialopinion/article/887751--war-resisters-also-deserve-a-memorial|title=War resisters also deserve a memorial |author=Peter Smollett |date=9 November 2010|work=Toronto Star |accessdate=12 November 2010}}</ref>). Rather than [[court-martial]] Sassoon, the [[Under-Secretary of State for War]], [[Ian Macpherson, 1st Baron Strathcarron|Ian Macpherson]], decided that he was unfit for service and had him sent to [[Craiglockhart War Hospital]] near [[Edinburgh]], where he was officially treated for [[neurasthenia]] (\"[[shell shock]]\").<ref name=ODNB />\n\nFor many years it had been thought that, before declining to return to active service, Sassoon had thrown his Military Cross into the [[River Mersey]] at [[Formby]] beach. According to his description of this incident in ''[[Memoirs of an Infantry Officer]]'' he did not do this as a symbolic rejection of militaristic values, but simply out of the need to perform some destructive act in catharsis of the black mood which was afflicting him; his account states that one of his pre-war sporting trophies, had he had one to hand, would have served his purpose equally well. In fact, the MC was discovered after the death of Sassoon's only son, George, in the home of Sassoon's ex-wife, which George had inherited. The Cross subsequently became the subject of a dispute among Sassoon's heirs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12779481.Family_in_row_over_Sassoon_war_medal_sale/|title=Family in row over Sassoon war medal sale|website=The Herald|location=Glasgow|access-date=14 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt Craiglockhart, Sassoon met [[Wilfred Owen]], a fellow poet who would eventually exceed him in fame. It was thanks to Sassoon that Owen persevered in his ambition to write better poetry. A manuscript copy of Owen's ''[[Anthem for Doomed Youth]]'' containing Sassoon's handwritten amendments survives as testimony to the extent of his influence and is currently on display at London's [[Imperial War Museum]]. Sassoon became to Owen \"[[John Keats|Keats]] and Christ and Elijah\"; surviving documents demonstrate clearly the depth of Owen's love and admiration for him. Both men returned to active service in France, but Owen was killed in 1918, a week before Armistice. Sassoon, despite all this, was promoted to [[first lieutenant|lieutenant]], and having spent some time out of danger in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], eventually returned to the Front. On 13 July 1918, Sassoon was almost immediately wounded again\u2014by [[friendly fire]] when he was shot in the head by a fellow British soldier who had mistaken him for a German near [[Arras]], France. As a result, he spent the remainder of the war in Britain. By this time he had been promoted to acting [[captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]]. He relinquished his commission on health grounds on 12 March 1919, but was allowed to retain the rank of captain.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31221 |supp=y|page=3269|date=7 March 1919}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Sassoon was instrumental in bringing Owen's work to the attention of a wider audience. Their friendship is the subject of [[Stephen MacDonald]]'s play, ''[[Not About Heroes]]''.\n\n==Post-war life==\n[[File:Green plaque Siegfried Sassoon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Blue plaque|Green plaque]] on the site of Sassoon's former home in Tufton Street, [[Westminster]], London]]\n[[File:Quiller-couch letter to Sassoon.jpg|thumb|upright|A handwritten letter to Sassoon from [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]], about the possibility of Quiller-Couch writing for [[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|''The Daily Herald'']].]]\n\n===Editor and novelist===\nHaving lived for a period at [[Oxford]], where he spent more time visiting literary friends than studying, he dabbled briefly in the politics of the Labour movement, and in 1919 took up a post as literary editor of the socialist ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]''.  He lived at 54 Tufton Street, [[Westminster]] from 1919 to 1925; the house is no longer standing, but the location of his former home is marked by a memorial plaque.<ref>[http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ City of Westminster green plaques.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716210428/http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/ |date=16 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDuring his period at the ''Herald'', Sassoon was responsible for employing several eminent names as reviewers, including [[E. M. Forster]] and [[Charlotte Mew]], and commissioned original material from \"names\" like [[Arnold Bennett]] and [[Osbert Sitwell]]. His artistic interests extended to music.  While at Oxford he was introduced to the young [[William Walton]], to whom he became a friend and patron.  Walton later dedicated his ''[[Portsmouth Point (Walton)|Portsmouth Point]]'' overture to Sassoon in recognition of his financial assistance and moral support.\n\nSassoon later embarked on a lecture tour of the USA, as well as travelling in Europe and throughout Britain. He acquired a car, a gift from the publisher [[Frankie Schuster]], and became renowned among his friends for his lack of driving skill, but this did not prevent him making full use of the mobility it gave him.\n\nSassoon was a great admirer of the Welsh poet [[Henry Vaughan]]. On a visit to Wales in 1923, he paid a pilgrimage to Vaughan's grave at [[Llansantffraed]], [[Powys]], and there wrote one of his best-known peacetime poems, \"At the Grave of Henry Vaughan\". The deaths within a short space of time of three of his closest friends \u2013 [[Edmund Gosse]], [[Thomas Hardy]] and Frankie Schuster \u2013 came as another serious setback to his personal happiness.\n\nAt the same time, Sassoon was preparing to take a new direction.  While in America, he had experimented with a novel. In 1928, he branched out into prose, with ''[[Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man]]'', the anonymously-published first volume of a fictionalised autobiography, which was almost immediately accepted as a classic, bringing its author new fame as a humorous writer. The book won the 1928 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize|James Tait Black Award]] for fiction. Sassoon followed it with ''[[Memoirs of an Infantry Officer]]'' (1930) and ''[[Sherston's Progress]]'' (1936). In later years, he revisited his youth and early manhood with three volumes of genuine autobiography, which were also widely acclaimed.  These were ''The Old Century'', ''The Weald of Youth'' and ''Siegfried's Journey''.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:SiegfriedSassoonGraveMells(GrahamAllard)May2006.jpg|upright|thumb|Siegfried Sassoon's gravestone in [[Mells, Somerset|Mells]] churchyard]]\n[[File:Siegfried Sassoon 23 Campden Hill Square blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 23 Campden Hill Square, London]]\n\n===Affairs===\nSassoon, having matured greatly as a result of his military service, continued to seek emotional fulfilment, initially in a succession of love affairs with men, including:\n*William Park \"Gabriel\" Atkin, the landscape architectural and figure painter, draftsman and illustrator<ref>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Neil|title=Out of the Past: Gay and Lesbian History from 1869 to the Present|url=https://archive.org/details/outofpastgayand00mill|url-access=registration|year=1995|page=[https://archive.org/details/outofpastgayand00mill/page/96 96]}}</ref>\n*[[Ivor Novello]], actor<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n*[[Glen Byam Shaw]], actor and Novello's former lover<ref name=\"Wilson2003\">{{cite book|author=Jean Moorcroft Wilson|title=Siegfried Sassoon: The Journey from the Trenches : a Biography (1918\u20131967)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO9KDzIYSZoC&pg=PR11|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-96713-6|pages=11\u2013}}</ref>\n*[[Prince Philipp of Hesse]], German aristocrat<ref name=\"Telegraph\">{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3593051/The-war-poets-long-peace.html|title=The war poet's long peace|author=John Gross|website=The Telegraph|date=22 April 2003|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref>\n*[[John Beverley Nichols|Beverley Nichols]], writer<ref name=\"Telegraph\"/>\n*[[Stephen Tennant|the Hon.

The marriage led to the birth of a child, something which he had purportedly craved for a long time:\n*[[George Sassoon]] (1936\u20132006), who was married four times: firstly Stephanie Munro, at Inverness in 1955 (dissolved 1961); secondly Marguerite Dicks in 1961 (dissolved 1974); thirdly Susan Christian-Howard in 1975 (dissolved 1982); and lastly Alison Pulvertaft.\nGeorge became a scientist, linguist, and author, and was adored by Siegfried, who wrote several poems addressed to him. However, the marriage broke down after [[World War II|the Second World War]], Sassoon apparently unable to find a compromise between the solitude he enjoyed and the companionship he craved.\n\nSeparated from his wife in 1945, Sassoon lived in seclusion at [[Heytesbury]] in Wiltshire, although he maintained contact with a circle which included [[E. M. Forster|E M Forster]] and [[J. R. Ackerley|J R Ackerley]]. One of his closest friends was the cricketer, [[Dennis Silk]] who later became Warden (headmaster) of [[Radley College]]. He also formed a close friendship with Vivien Hancock, then headmistress of [[Greenways School]] at [[Ashton Gifford House|Ashton Gifford]], where his son George was a pupil. The relationship provoked Hester to make strong accusations against Hancock, who responded with the threat of legal action.{{Sfn|Wilson|2003|p=|pp=345\u20136}}\n\n===Religion===\nTowards the end of his life, Sassoon converted to Roman Catholicism. He had hoped that [[Ronald Knox]], a Roman Catholic priest and writer whom he admired, would instruct him in the faith, but Knox was too ill to do so.<ref>[http://www.catholicauthors.com/knox.html Catholic Authors \u2013 Ronald Knox]</ref> The priest Sebastian Moore was chosen to instruct him instead, and Sassoon was admitted to the faith at [[Downside Abbey]] in Somerset.<ref>{{Citation\n  | last = Fisher\n  | first = Deb\n  | title = Interview with Dom Sebastian Moore\n  | journal = Siegfried's Journal\n  | volume = 14\n  |date=July 2008\n  }}</ref> He also paid regular visits to the nuns at [[Stanbrook Abbey]], and the Abbey press printed commemorative editions of some of his poems.

The work, in [[E&nbsp;minor]], takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when previous generations of [[Bach family]] members composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}} (ABA)\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a German text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing {{lang|it|[[colla parte]]}}. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along the principles of these older compositions in the 1710s or 1720s, motets were regarded as an antiquated genre. According to [[Philipp Spitta]], [[Johann Michael Bach]]'s motet {{ill|Halt, was du hast|choralwiki|Halt, was du hast (Johann Michael Bach)|lt=''Halt, was du hast''}}, [[ABA&nbsp;I,&nbsp;10]], which contains a setting of the \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" chorale, may have been on Johann Sebastian's mind when he composed his motet named after the chorale, in E&nbsp;minor like his ancestor's.{{sfn|Spitta|1899|p=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastianb02spituoft#page/601 601]}}\n\nBach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} Among around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998|pp=228\u2013233, 459, 467}}{{sfn|Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um BWV deest (BC C 8) at Bach Digital}} ''Jesu, meine Freude'' is one of only five (BWV&nbsp;225\u2013229) which, without exception, have always been considered as belonging in that category.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} In eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for SSATB voices.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} Bach composed only very few works for a five-part choir: most of his other motets are for double SATB choir, while the large majority of his vocal church music is to be performed with a (single) SATB choir.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} Like for most of his other motets, no continuo or other instrumental accompaniment has survived for BWV&nbsp;227, but it is surmised there used to be one.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Melamed|1995}} \n\n===Epistle text and chorale===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]], 8:1\u20132 and 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers each take one verse from the Epistle as their text.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn's first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of its last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\n[[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s chorale melody for the hymn, [[Zahn number|Zahn]]&nbsp;8032, was published for the first time in his ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'' of 1653, after which several variants of the [[hymn tune]] were published in other hymnals over the ensuing decades.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}} The tune is in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} In the version of [[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch|Vopelius's ''Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch'']] of 1682, the hymnal used in Leipzig, the melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Vopelius|1682|p=[[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch#p. 780|780]]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The hymn tune appears in several variants in the uneven movements of the motet.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\nAs a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images.

Jones]] several movements of the motet show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, so that the final arrangement of the work likely happened in the late 1720s, around the time when two other motets which can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]], were written.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet: the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Structure and scoring ==\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. Only the alto, the middle voice in the motet's SSATB setting, sings in all movements. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing {{lang|it|colla parte}} in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}\n\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas (indicated with stanza numbers 1 and 6 in the diagram below). The second (Rom.&nbsp;8:1) and penultimate (Rom.&nbsp;8:11) movements use the same themes in [[Fugue (music)|fugal writing]]. The third (stanza 2) and fifth (stanza 3) movements, both five-part, mirror the seventh (stanza 4) and ninth (stanza 5) movements, both four-part. The fourth (Rom.&nbsp;8:2) and eighth  (Rom.&nbsp;8:10) movements are both [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, the fourth for the three highest voices, the other for the three lowest voices.

The work, in [[E&nbsp;minor]], takes its title from the [[Lutheran hymn]] \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\", with poetry by [[Johann Franck]] and a [[Chorale|chorale melody]] by [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]. [[Movement (music)|Movements]] based on the six [[stanza]]s of the hymn are interspersed with five movements based on passages from the [[Epistle to the Romans]]. The Biblical text, which contains key [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] teaching, is contrasted by the hymn, written in the first person with a focus on emotion, and Bach set both with attention to dramatic detail {{sfn|Eckerson|2020}} in a symmetrical structure of eleven movements. Bach set the [[chorale]] tune in various ways, from a four-part setting which begins and ends the work, to a [[chorale fantasia]] and a free setting which only paraphrases the tune. Four verses from the Epistle are set in [[motet]] style, two four five voices, and two for three voices. The central movement is a five-part [[Fugue (music)|fugue]].  Bach used [[word painting]] to intensify the theological meaning of both hymn and Epistle texts.\n\n{{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is one of few works by Bach for five vocal parts. It may have been composed for a funeral, but scholars doubt a 1912 dating to a specific funeral in Leipzig on 18 July 1723. Chorale settings from the motet were included in the [[Dietel manuscript]], a collection of Bach's chorales from {{circa|1735}}. At least one of the eleven movements seems to date to a period before Bach's post in Leipzig. [[Christoph Wolff]] suggested that it may have been composed for education in both choral singing and theology. The motet, unique in its complex symmetrical structure juxtaposing hymn text and Bible text, has been regarded as one of Bach's greatest motets.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} It was the first of his motets to be recorded, in 1927.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nIn the context of late 17th-century [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Germany, where and when previous generations of [[Bach family]] members composed their motets\u2014a collection of which was preserved in the {{lang|de|[[Altbachisches Archiv]]}} (ABA)\u2014, motets were choral compositions, mostly with a number of independent voices exceeding that of a standard [[SATB]] choir, and with a German text from sacred scripture and/or based on a [[Lutheran hymn]]. In the latter case, the [[Lutheran chorale|corresponding chorale tune]] was usually adopted into the composition. Instrumental accompaniment was often limited to [[basso continuo]] and/or instruments playing {{lang|it|[[colla parte]]}}. By the time Bach started to compose [[Motet (Bach)|his motets]] along the principles of these older compositions in the 1710s or 1720s, motets were regarded as an antiquated genre. According to [[Philipp Spitta]], [[Johann Michael Bach]]'s motet {{ill|Halt, was du hast|choralwiki|Halt, was du hast (Johann Michael Bach)|lt=''Halt, was du hast''}}, [[ABA&nbsp;I,&nbsp;10]], which contains a setting of the \"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" chorale, may have been on Johann Sebastian's mind when he composed his motet named after the chorale, in E&nbsp;minor like his ancestor's.{{sfn|Spitta|1899|p=[https://archive.org/stream/johannsebastianb02spituoft#page/601 601]}}\n\nBach composed most of [[church cantata (Bach)|his church cantatas]] for occasions of the [[Liturgical calendar (Lutheran)|Lutheran liturgical calendar]] of the time and place where he was occupied. Church cantatas for weddings and funerals fall outside such scheme, and also his motets appear to belong in this latter category.{{sfn|Cookson|2010}} Among around 15 extant compositions which at some point or another were designated as a motet by Bach ([[BWV&nbsp;118]], [[motet (Bach)|225\u2013231]], [[BWV Anh.|Anh.]]&nbsp;159\u2013165, [[Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um|deest]]),{{sfn|D\u00fcrr|Kobayashi|1998|pp=228\u2013233, 459, 467}}{{sfn|Der Gerechte k\u00f6mmt um BWV deest (BC C 8) at Bach Digital}} ''Jesu, meine Freude'' is one of only five (BWV&nbsp;225\u2013229) which, without exception, have always been considered as belonging in that category.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} In eleven movements, {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is the longest and most musically complex of Bach's motets.{{sfn|Ameln|1965}}{{sfn|Robins|2020}} It is scored for SSATB voices.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}} Bach composed only very few works for a five-part choir: most of his other motets are for double SATB choir, while the large majority of his church music is to be performed with a (single) SATB choir.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} Like for most of his other motets, no continuo or other instrumental accompaniment has survived for BWV&nbsp;227, but it is surmised there used to be one.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Melamed|1995}} \n\n===Epistle text and chorale===\n[[File:Jesu Meine Freude Praxis Cruger 1653.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.1|\"{{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude]]|italic=no}}\" in [[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'', 1653]]\nThe text of {{lang|de|Jesu, meine Freude}} is compiled from two sources, the 1653 {{lang|de|[[Jesu, meine Freude|hymn of the same name]]|italic=no}} with words by [[Johann Franck]], and Bible verses from the [[Epistle to the Romans]], 8:1\u20132 and 9\u201311.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} In the motet, the six hymn stanzas form the odd movement numbers, while the even numbers each take one verse from the Epistle as their text.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} The hymn's first line, which [[Catherine Winkworth]] translated as \"Jesu, priceless treasure\" in 1869,{{sfn|CCEL|2020}} is repeated as the last line of its last stanza, framing the poetry.{{sfn|Hymnary text|2020}}\n\n[[Johann Cr\u00fcger]]'s chorale melody for the hymn, [[Zahn number|Zahn]]&nbsp;8032, was published for the first time in his ''[[Praxis pietatis melica]]'' of 1653, after which several variants of the [[hymn tune]] were published in other hymnals over the ensuing decades.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}} The tune is in [[bar form]].{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} In the version of [[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch|Vopelius's ''Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch'']] of 1682, the hymnal used in Leipzig, the melody of the first line is the same as that of the last line.{{sfn|Zahn|1891|p=[https://archive.org/details/1508286757bsb11304502/page/n656/mode/2up 651]}}{{sfn|Vopelius|1682|p=[[Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch#p. 780|780]]}}{{sfn|Hymnary tune|2020}} The hymn tune appears in several variants in the uneven movements of the motet.{{sfn|Melamed|1995|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=JDlBMqI628UC&pg=PA86 86\u201387]}}\n\nAs a key teaching of the Lutheran faith, the Gospel text reflects on Jesus Christ freeing man from sin and death, focused on the contrast of living \"in the flesh\" or \"according to the Spirit\".{{sfn|May|2020}} The hymn text is written from an individual believer's point of view, addressing Jesus as joy and support, against enemies and the vanity of existence, which are expressed in stark images.

Jones]] several movements of the motet show a style too advanced to have been written in 1723, so that the final arrangement of the work likely happened in the late 1720s, around the time when two other motets which can be dated with more certainty, ''Singet dem Herrn ein neues Lied'' and the funeral motet [[Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf, BWV 226|''Der Geist hilft unser Schwachheit auf'', BWV 226]], were written.{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=203}} The [[Dietel manuscript]], written around 1735, contains three chorales extracted from the motet: the composition of the motet is supposed to have been completed before that time.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}{{sfn|Wolff|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ronZdkhQouMC&pg=PA329 329]}}\n\n== Structure and scoring ==\nThe motet is structured in eleven movements, with text alternating a chorale stanza and a passage from the Epistle.{{sfn|Dellal|2020}} Bach scored it for a choir of two [[soprano]] parts (S or SS), [[alto]] (A), [[tenor]] (T) and [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] (B). The number of voices in the movements varies from three to five. Only the alto, the middle voice in the motet's SSATB setting, sings in all movements. The motet was possibly to be accompanied by instruments playing {{lang|it|colla parte}} in the practice at the time,{{sfn|Jones|2013|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0YwzAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA198 198]}} but no parts for them survived.{{sfn|Jesu, meine Freude BWV 227 at Bach Digital}}\n\nThe music is arranged in different layers of symmetry around the sixth movement.{{sfn|Jones|2013|pp=202\u2013203}} The first and last movements are the same four-part setting of two different hymn stanzas (indicated with stanza numbers 1 and 6 in the diagram below). The second (Rom.&nbsp;8:1) and penultimate (Rom.&nbsp;8:11) movements use the same themes in [[Fugue (music)|fugal writing]]. The third (stanza 2) and fifth (stanza 3) movements, both five-part, mirror the seventh (stanza 4) and ninth (stanza 5) movements, both four-part. The fourth (Rom.&nbsp;8:2) and eighth  (Rom.&nbsp;8:10) movements are both [[Trio (music)|trio]]s, the fourth for the three highest voices, the other for the three lowest voices.
