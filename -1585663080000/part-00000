This being the main responsibility, every civil servant is assigned to a particular office which deals with policy matters pertaining to that area. The policy matters are framed, modified, interpreted in this office under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer in consultation with the Minister. The implementation of policies is also done on the advice of the Officer. The [[Cabinet Secretary]] stands at the top of the government machinery involved in policy making followed by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director, Under Secretary and Junior Scale Officers in that order. These appointments are filled by civil servants according to seniority in the Civil Services. In the process of decision making, a number of officers give their views to the Minister who weighs the matter and makes a decision considering the issue involved.\n\nThe implementation process involves supervision and touring. The allocation of enormous funds to and by the field officers calls for supervision and the officials concerned have to reply to queries made in the Parliament for which they must remain well informed.\n\nThe Civil servant has also to represent the Government in another country or in International forums. At the level of Deputy Secretary, he is even authorized to sign agreements on behalf of the Government.\n\nA civil servant begins his career in the state with two years in probation. This period is spent at training schools, Secretariat, field offices or in a [[District Magistrate]]'s office. He is given the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate and has to look after the law, order and general administration including developmental work in the area under his charge. After the probation and 2 years of services as a junior scale officer, the officer is put in the senior scale. Then he may function as District Magistrate, Managing Director of a Public Enterprise or Director of a Department. Senior Scale comprises the Senior Time Scale (Joint Secretary), Junior Administrative Grade (Additional Secretary) and the Selection Grade (Special Secretary). Selection Grade is given on promotion after 13 years of regular service. The next promotion within the State is that of a Commissioner-cum-Secretary after 16 years. This promotion also entitles them to the Super Time Scale. Then after 24 years of regular service an IAS officer may be promoted to Above super time scale who is designated as [[Principal Secretary (India)|Principal Secretaries]]/Financial Commissioners in some states\n\nEach State has many Secretaries/Principal Secretaries and only one [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]]. Some appointments of Secretaries are considered more prestigious than others, e.g., the Finance Secretary, Development Commissioners, Home Secretary and hence they enjoy the salary of a Principal Secretary. the Chief Secretary in the State is the top ranking civil servant and may be assisted by Additional Chief Secretaries. In some cadres/States e.g. New Delhi, Financial Commissioner and other high ranking secretaries such as Additional Chief Secretaries enjoy the pay of the Chief Secretary .\n\nIn the District, the administrative head is the [[District collector|Collector]] or Deputy Commissioner or District Magistrate. The DM/Collector/DC handle the affairs of the District including development functions. He necessarily tours all rural sectors inspecting specific projects, disputed sites and looks into the problems of people on the spot also.\n\nAt the divisional level, the Divisional Commissioner is in charge of his division. His role is to oversee law and order and general administration and developmental work. Appeals against the Divisional Commissioner are heard by the Chairman of the Board of Revenue.\n\n===Indian Forest Service (IFS)===\n{{main|Indian Forest Service}}\n\nIndia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce scientific forest management. In 1864, the British Raj established the [[Indian Forest Service#Imperial Forest Service (IFS)|Imperial Forest Department]]. In 1866 Dr. [[Dietrich Brandis]], a German forest officer, was appointed Inspector General of Forests. The Imperial Forestry Service was organized in 1867. \n \nOfficers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in [[Germany]] and [[France]], and from 1885 to 1905 at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]], [[London]], which was a noted professional college of forestry. From 1905 to 1926, the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], and [[University of Edinburgh]] undertook the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers.\n \nFrom 1927 to 1932, forest officers were trained at the Imperial [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] (FRI) at [[Dehradun]] (established in 1906). Later The [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Indian Forest College]] (IFC) was established in 1938 at [[Dehradun]], and officers recruited to the Superior Forest Service by the states and provinces were trained there. [[Forestry]], which was managed by the federal government until then, was transferred to the \"provincial list\" by the Government of India Act 1935, and recruitment to the Imperial Forestry Service was subsequently discontinued.\n \nThe modern Indian Forest Service (IFS) was established in 1966, after independence, under the ''All India Services Act 1951'', for protection, conservation, and regeneration of forest resources.\n \nIndia has an area of 635,400&nbsp;km designated as forests, about 19.32 percent of the country. Forest is included in the [[Concurrent List]].\n\nRanks of the Indian Forest Service are as follows: Assistant Conservator of Forests - Probationary Officer, [[Divisional Forest Officer]] (DFOs), \n[[Deputy Conservator of Forests]],\n[[Conservator of Forests]] (CFs),\nChief Conservator of Forests (CCFs),\nAdditional [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (Addl.PCCFs),\n[[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF) & Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF) - highest post in a State,\n[[Director General of Forests (India)]] - highest post at Centre, selected from amongst the senior-most PCCFs of states.\n\nThe training at [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] is designed in such a way that an IFS officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of India. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to IFS officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the [[ISRO]]'s [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]], [[University of Twente]]/[[ITC Enschede|ITC]] [[Netherlands]] and in Wildlife Management from the [[Wildlife Institute of India]]. The IFS officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development]], SAARC Forestry Centre, [[Forest Survey of India]], [[Wildlife Institute of India]], [[Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education]] (ICFRE), [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, [[Wildlife Crime Control Bureau]] (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme.\n\n===Indian Police Service (IPS)===\n{{main|Indian Police Service}}\n\nThe Indian Police Service more popularly known as the 'IPS', is responsible for internal security, public safety and law and order. In 1948, a year after [[India]] gained [[Partition of India|independence]] from [[British Raj|Britain]], the Imperial Police (IP) was replaced by the Indian Police Service. The IPS is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers belong regardless of the agency for whom they work.\n\nAn IPS officer is subjected to and faces several life-threatening and harsh conditions which no other service in the country faces, they are entrusted with the overall law and order of the entire State as the Director General of Police and entire Districts as it's Superintendent of Police, and in Metropolitan Cities as Deputy Commissioner or the entire City as the Commissioner of Police. As Commissioner of Police they enjoy magisterial powers.\n\nThe IPS officer takes charge as an [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]] of a Sub-division/circle after probation of 2 years. The tenure of this post is normally 3 years. The next appointment is as [[Superintendent of Police]] or [[Deputy commissioner of police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] after 4 years, they get promoted to Junior Administrative Grade after 9 years, then they serve as [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Senior Superintendent of Police]] and get pay of Selection Grade (Level 13) in 12-14 years, then as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police]] or [[Additional Commissioner of Police]] in 15 years, an [[Inspector General of Police]] in 18 years, [[Additional Director General of Police]] in 25 years and finally, the [[Director General of Police]] after 30 years in service.\n\nIPS officers also work in national government agencies such as [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], [[Research and Analysis Wing]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], etc. IPS officers also get highly placed in several PSUs such as GAIL, SAIL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited etc. at the State Secretariat the Central Secretariat under the Central Staffing Scheme and in CAPFs such as Director General of Border Security Force, the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] and the [[Central Industrial Security Force]], etc. An IPS officer has vast opportunities to work in several International Organisations such as Interpol, International Cricket Council, the United Nations, Consulates (Foreign Missions) and Embassies all over the World in various capacities such as First Secretary, [[Consul (representative)|Consul]], [[Consul General]], Deputy High Commissioner, Minister, [[High Commissioner]] and [[Ambassador]].\n\nThe [[Director General of Police]] and [[Commissioner of Police]] is the head of the entire police force of the State or Metropolitan City (e.g. [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]]  etc.) and below him is the Additional DGP/Special Police Commissioner. The [[Inspector General#India|Inspector General]] or [[Joint Commissioner of Police]] is at the head of certain specialised police force like [[Criminal Investigation Department]], Special Branch, etc.\n\n==Reforms and changes==\nIn January 2012, the Government amended All India Services Rule 16 (3) which permits the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to retire in the public interest, incompetent and non-performing Officers after a review on their completion of 15 years or 25 years of qualifying service or attaining the age of 50.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| title= Retire non-performing bureaucrats: Centre to states| date= 1 July 2012| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120701135717/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| archivedate= 1 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS lazy retire\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lazy-and-incompetent-babus-to-retire-early/1/162137.html |title=Lazy and incompetent babus to retire early|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"corruption compulsory retirement\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/graft-taint-may-lead-to-retirement-for-babus/1/179684.html |title=Corruption taint may lead to compulsory retirement for babus|author=|date=21 April 2012 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS retire 15 incompetence\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/proposal-to-retire-incompetent-officers-after-15-year-service/20111130.htm |title=Proposal to retire incompetent officers after 15-year service|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Rediff News |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn recommendation by [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]], from year 2014 state civil servants are required to clear 1000 marks four-stage process including a written exam and interview conducted by Union Public Service Commission to get promoted to the three all India services which was previously based solely on basis of seniority and annual confidential reports.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-ias-462676| title=Exams for state civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-IAS/articleshow/27861653.cms| title=State civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref>\nExpected Reforms:\n1) Creation of Indian Medical Service for Doctors\n2) All India Judicial Service- to attract best law talent into the higher judiciary\n3) Indian Education Service- to increase the quality of policy making at Central level\n\n==Disputes in using acronym IFS==\nIndian Forest Service (IFS) is the oldest service and as per the old British records acronym was used to specify the Imperial Forest Service officers. But when the Indian Foreign Service was created (1946) the acronym IFS was also used to address officers belonging to Foreign Service. Strong protests and arguments were raised by the officers of the Indian Forest Service Officers for the wrong and unhealthy practice of addressing the Indian Forest Officers as IFoS  by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). As per their version if they want to change the acronym change the Indian Foreign Service as IFoS or Indian Diplomatic Service to avoid confusion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil Services of India]]\n*[[Special Duty Allowance (SDA)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091220111744/http://www.upsc.gov.in/ais/index.htm All India Services official website]\n* [http://upsc.gov.in/ Union Public Service Commission official website]\n* [http://persmin.nic.in/ Indian Administrative Service official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619060945/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=346 Indian Police Service official website]\n* [http://ifs.nic.in/ Indian Forest Service official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174347/http://persmin.nic.in/ersheet/StartQryERS.asp List of IAS Officers]\n* [https://www.kirankkannadanew.com/2019/11/upsc-recruitment-2019-employers-note.html UPSC new recruitment 2019 & 2020]\n[[Category:All India Services| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Public services in India}}{{Use Indian English|date=January 2019}}{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}\nThe '''All India Services''' ('''AIS''') comprises [[Civil Services of India]], namely the [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS), the [[Indian Forest Service]] (IFS) <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO INDIAN FOREIGN SERVICE --> and the [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS).<ref name=\"All India Services\">{{cite web|title=All India Services|url=http://www.archive.india.gov.in/knowindia/profile.php?id=32|website=Know India Official website of Government}}</ref> A common unique feature of the All India Services is that the members of these services are recruited by the Centre (Union government in federal polity), but their services are placed under various State cadres, and they have the liability to serve both under the State and under the Centre.<ref name=\"All India Services\"/> Due to the federal polity of the country, this is considered one of the tools that makes union government stronger than state governments.

This being the main responsibility, every civil servant is assigned to a particular office which deals with policy matters pertaining to that area. The policy matters are framed, modified, interpreted in this office under the direct supervision of the Administrative Officer in consultation with the Minister. The implementation of policies is also done on the advice of the Officer. The [[Cabinet Secretary]] stands at the top of the government machinery involved in policy making followed by Secretary/Additional Secretary, Joint Secretary, Director, Under Secretary and Junior Scale Officers in that order. These appointments are filled by civil servants according to seniority in the Civil Services. In the process of decision making, a number of officers give their views to the Minister who weighs the matter and makes a decision considering the issue involved.\n\nThe implementation process involves supervision and touring. The allocation of enormous funds to and by the field officers calls for supervision and the officials concerned have to reply to queries made in the Parliament for which they must remain well informed.\n\nThe Civil servant has also to represent the Government in another country or in International forums. At the level of Deputy Secretary, he is even authorized to sign agreements on behalf of the Government.\n\nA civil servant begins his career in the state with two years in probation. This period is spent at training schools, Secretariat, field offices or in a [[District Magistrate]]'s office. He is given the position of Sub-Divisional Magistrate and has to look after the law, order and general administration including developmental work in the area under his charge. After the probation and 2 years of services as a junior scale officer, the officer is put in the senior scale. Then he may function as District Magistrate, Managing Director of a Public Enterprise or Director of a Department. Senior Scale comprises the Senior Time Scale (Joint Secretary), Junior Administrative Grade (Additional Secretary) and the Selection Grade (Special Secretary). Selection Grade is given on promotion after 13 years of regular service. The next promotion within the State is that of a Commissioner-cum-Secretary after 16 years. This promotion also entitles them to the Super Time Scale. Then after 24 years of regular service an IAS officer may be promoted to Above super time scale who is designated as [[Principal Secretary (India)|Principal Secretaries]]/Financial Commissioners in some states\n\nEach State has many Secretaries/Principal Secretaries and only one [[Chief Secretary (India)|Chief Secretary]]. Some appointments of Secretaries are considered more prestigious than others, e.g., the Finance Secretary, Development Commissioners, Home Secretary and hence they enjoy the salary of a Principal Secretary. the Chief Secretary in the State is the top ranking civil servant and may be assisted by Additional Chief Secretaries. In some cadres/States e.g. New Delhi, Financial Commissioner and other high ranking secretaries such as Additional Chief Secretaries enjoy the pay of the Chief Secretary .\n\nIn the District, the administrative head is the [[District collector|Collector]] or Deputy Commissioner or District Magistrate. The DM/Collector/DC handle the affairs of the District including development functions. He necessarily tours all rural sectors inspecting specific projects, disputed sites and looks into the problems of people on the spot also.\n\nAt the divisional level, the Divisional Commissioner is in charge of his division. His role is to oversee law and order and general administration and developmental work. Appeals against the Divisional Commissioner are heard by the Chairman of the Board of Revenue.\n\n===Indian Forest Service (IFS)===\n{{main|Indian Forest Service}}\n\nIndia was one of the first countries in the world to introduce scientific forest management. In 1864, the British Raj established the [[Indian Forest Service#Imperial Forest Service (IFS)|Imperial Forest Department]]. In 1866 Dr. [[Dietrich Brandis]], a German forest officer, was appointed Inspector General of Forests. The Imperial Forestry Service was organized in 1867. \n \nOfficers appointed from 1867 to 1885 were trained in [[Germany]] and [[France]], and from 1885 to 1905 at [[Royal Indian Engineering College|Cooper's Hill]], [[London]], which was a noted professional college of forestry. From 1905 to 1926, the [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge]], and [[University of Edinburgh]] undertook the task of training Imperial Forestry Service officers.\n \nFrom 1927 to 1932, forest officers were trained at the Imperial [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Forest Research Institute]] (FRI) at [[Dehradun]] (established in 1906). Later The [[Forest Research Institute (India)|Indian Forest College]] (IFC) was established in 1938 at [[Dehradun]], and officers recruited to the Superior Forest Service by the states and provinces were trained there. [[Forestry]], which was managed by the federal government until then, was transferred to the \"provincial list\" by the Government of India Act 1935, and recruitment to the Imperial Forestry Service was subsequently discontinued.\n \nThe modern Indian Forest Service (IFS) was established in 1966, after independence, under the ''All India Services Act 1951'', for protection, conservation, and regeneration of forest resources.\n \nIndia has an area of 635,400&nbsp;km designated as forests, about 19.32 percent of the country. Forest is included in the [[Concurrent List]].\n\nRanks of the Indian Forest Service are as follows: Assistant Conservator of Forests - Probationary Officer, [[Divisional Forest Officer]] (DFOs), \n[[Deputy Conservator of Forests]],\n[[Conservator of Forests]] (CFs),\nChief Conservator of Forests (CCFs),\nAdditional [[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (Addl.PCCFs),\n[[Principal Chief Conservator of Forests]] (PCCF) & Principal Chief Conservator of Forests (HoFF) - highest post in a State,\n[[Director General of Forests (India)]] - highest post at Centre, selected from amongst the senior-most PCCFs of states.\n\nThe training at [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] is designed in such a way that an IFS officer after completion of the probation, should be hardened enough to serve in the most difficult terrains of India. Another remarkable feature of this service is that it needs keen technical knowledge along with excellent administrative capacity to deliver the duty. Government of India is also providing Hari Singh fellowships to IFS officers to get specialized in the field of Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System from the [[ISRO]]'s [[Indian Institute of Remote Sensing]], [[University of Twente]]/[[ITC Enschede|ITC]] [[Netherlands]] and in Wildlife Management from the [[Wildlife Institute of India]]. The IFS officers also work in various International and National organizations related to management of forests, wildlife and environment such as [[Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development]], SAARC Forestry Centre, [[Forest Survey of India]], [[Wildlife Institute of India]], [[Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education]] (ICFRE), [[Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy]] (IGNFA), Directorate of Forest Education, [[Wildlife Crime Control Bureau]] (WCCB), etc. besides getting entrusted with senior positions in the Central Secretariat, State Secretariats and various assignments under the Central Staffing Scheme.\n\n===Indian Police Service (IPS)===\n{{main|Indian Police Service}}\n\nThe Indian Police Service more popularly known as the 'IPS', is responsible for internal security, public safety and law and order. In 1948, a year after [[India]] gained [[Partition of India|independence]] from [[British Raj|Britain]], the Imperial Police (IP) was replaced by the Indian Police Service. The IPS is not a law enforcement agency in its own right; rather it is the body to which all senior police officers belong regardless of the agency for whom they work.\n\nAn IPS officer is subjected to and faces several life-threatening and harsh conditions which no other service in the country faces, they are entrusted with the overall law and order of the entire State as the Director General of Police and entire Districts as it's Superintendent of Police, and in Metropolitan Cities as Deputy Commissioner or the entire City as the Commissioner of Police. As Commissioner of Police they enjoy magisterial powers.\n\nThe IPS officer takes charge as an [[Assistant Superintendent of Police]] of a Sub-division/circle after probation of 2 years. The tenure of this post is normally 3 years. The next appointment is as [[Superintendent of Police]] or [[Deputy commissioner of police (India)|Deputy Commissioner of Police]] after 4 years, they get promoted to Junior Administrative Grade after 9 years, then they serve as [[Superintendent of Police (India)|Senior Superintendent of Police]] and get pay of Selection Grade (Level 13) in 12-14 years, then as [[Deputy Inspector General of Police]] or [[Additional Commissioner of Police]] in 15 years, an [[Inspector General of Police]] in 18 years, [[Additional Director General of Police]] in 25 years and finally, the [[Director General of Police]] after 30 years in service.\n\nIPS officers also work in national government agencies such as [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], [[Research and Analysis Wing]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]], etc. IPS officers also get highly placed in several PSUs such as GAIL, SAIL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited etc. at the State Secretariat the Central Secretariat under the Central Staffing Scheme and in CAPFs such as Director General of Border Security Force, the [[Central Reserve Police Force]] and the [[Central Industrial Security Force]], etc. An IPS officer has vast opportunities to work in several International Organisations such as Interpol, International Cricket Council, the United Nations, Consulates (Foreign Missions) and Embassies all over the World in various capacities such as First Secretary, [[Consul (representative)|Consul]], [[Consul General]], Deputy High Commissioner, Minister, [[High Commissioner]] and [[Ambassador]].\n\nThe [[Director General of Police]] and [[Commissioner of Police]] is the head of the entire police force of the State or Metropolitan City (e.g. [[Kolkata]], [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]]  etc.) and below him is the Additional DGP/Special Police Commissioner. The [[Inspector General#India|Inspector General]] or [[Joint Commissioner of Police]] is at the head of certain specialised police force like [[Criminal Investigation Department]], Special Branch, etc.\n\n==Reforms and changes==\nIn January 2012, the Government amended All India Services Rule 16 (3) which permits the Central Government in consultation with the State Government to retire in the public interest, incompetent and non-performing Officers after a review on their completion of 15 years or 25 years of qualifying service or attaining the age of 50.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| title= Retire non-performing bureaucrats: Centre to states| date= 1 July 2012| url-status= dead| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120701135717/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Retire-non-performing-bureaucrats-Centre-to-states/Article1-881583.aspx| archivedate= 1 July 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS lazy retire\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/lazy-and-incompetent-babus-to-retire-early/1/162137.html |title=Lazy and incompetent babus to retire early|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=8 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"corruption compulsory retirement\">{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/graft-taint-may-lead-to-retirement-for-babus/1/179684.html |title=Corruption taint may lead to compulsory retirement for babus|author=|date=21 April 2012 |work= |publisher=[[India Today]] |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=21 April 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"AIS retire 15 incompetence\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/report/proposal-to-retire-incompetent-officers-after-15-year-service/20111130.htm |title=Proposal to retire incompetent officers after 15-year service|author=|date=30 November 2011 |work= |publisher=Rediff News |location=[[New Delhi]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn recommendation by [[Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions]], from year 2014 state civil servants are required to clear 1000 marks four-stage process including a written exam and interview conducted by Union Public Service Commission to get promoted to the three all India services which was previously based solely on basis of seniority and annual confidential reports.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-ias-462676| title=Exams for state civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url= http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Exams-for-state-civil-services-officers-for-promotion-to-IAS/articleshow/27861653.cms| title=State civil services officers for promotion to IAS| date=4 April 2014}}</ref>\nExpected Reforms:\n1) Creation of Indian Medical Service for Doctors\n2) All India Judicial Service- to attract best law talent into the higher judiciary\n3) Indian Education Service- to increase the quality of policy making at Central level\n\n==Disputes in using acronym IFS==\nIndian Forest Service (IFS) is the oldest service and as per the old British records acronym was used to specify the Imperial Forest Service officers. But when the Indian Foreign Service was created (1946) the acronym IFS was also used to address officers belonging to Foreign Service. Strong protests and arguments were raised by the officers of the Indian Forest Service Officers for the wrong and unhealthy practice of addressing the Indian Forest Officers as IFoS  by the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) and Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). As per their version if they want to change the acronym change the Indian Foreign Service as IFoS or Indian Diplomatic Service to avoid confusion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Civil Services of India]]\n*[[Special Duty Allowance (SDA)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091220111744/http://www.upsc.gov.in/ais/index.htm All India Services official website]\n* [http://upsc.gov.in/ Union Public Service Commission official website]\n* [http://persmin.nic.in/ Indian Administrative Service official website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619060945/http://mha.nic.in/uniquepage.asp?Id_Pk=346 Indian Police Service official website]\n* [http://ifs.nic.in/ Indian Forest Service official website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110927174347/http://persmin.nic.in/ersheet/StartQryERS.asp List of IAS Officers]\n[[Category:All India Services| ]]\n", "name_user": "106.206.60.166", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eExternal links)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Services"}

Despite progressing to the next round of the Champions League playing in two major tournaments was beginning to take it's toll on Leeds young but exhausted squad and in the run up to X-mas and the New Year saw Leeds fall worryingly close to the relegation zone but recently brought Rio Ferdinand for 18 million -a world record for a defender and soon after Robbie Kean on loan and key players returning from injury Leeds begun to pick up impressive form in the Premiership and in the Champions League where Leeds progressed to the quarter final, despite ending the season in red hot form the Champions League dream came to an end in the semi final and United just missed out on 3rd place on the last day of the season.

Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

G.

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include [[Robert Graves]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north. The front of the college runs between the [[Oxford Oratory]] and the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]].

Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]].

The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room.

Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was deisgned to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened.

A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E.

In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' pub was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]].

The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

G. Vernon Harcourt]] and [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mary Ward]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} Other people who assisted in the founding were [[Anna Swanwick]] and [[Owen Roberts (educator)|Owen Roberts]].\n\nThis new effort resulted in the founding of ''Somerville Hall'', named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}} It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=23}} She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.\n\n[[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] was chosen as the first principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=24}} Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as \"an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.\"{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=25}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Phillips - Mary Fairfax, Mrs William Somerville, 1780 - 1872.

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include [[Robert Graves]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north.

It also contains Green Hall, where guests to college are often greeted and in which prospective students are registered and wait for interviews; some of the college's paintings by [[Roger Fry]] are located here.<ref name=artuk /> Most of the administration of college, and the academic [[pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeon-holes]] are in House, as is the Mary Somerville Room, a reception room featuring paintings by Mary Somerville, [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] and [[George Frederic Watts]].<ref name=artuk />\n\n===Park===\n[[File:Park Building, Somerville College, Oxford University.jpg|thumb|right|Park Building]]\nOriginally known as West, due to its location within the college, the idea of building a second self-contained hall was inspired by [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room.

Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was deisgned to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened. It now holds around 120,000 items (95,000 on open shelves), making it one of the largest college libraries in the university.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}}\n\n[[Amelia Edwards]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Vera Brittain]] have been notable benefactors to the library.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}} The library contains paintings by Mary Somerville, [[John Constable]], [[Maud Sumner]] and [[Patrick George]].<ref name=artuk />\n\nThe John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill's personal library in London at the time of his death, with significant annotations in many of the books.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/special-collections/john-stuart-mill-collection/ |title=John Stuart Mill Collection \u2013 Somerville College Oxford |publisher=University of Oxford |access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle (having been designed to bring the college together) and is open 24 hours, with access to college-wide wifi, a group study room, and computing and printing facilities.

A. L. Fisher]], the Vice-Chancellor of the University and [[Gilbert Murray]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=22}} Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J. Forester in 1897 and bought from [[University College, Oxford|University]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] Colleges for \u00a34,000 and \u00a31,400 respectively.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> There was difficulty in the construction of the buildings, which is now thought to have been the result of the outer limit of the Oxford city fortifications running under the site. In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' pub was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by [https://sculpture.gla.ac.uk/view/person.php?id=msib2_1208276253/ Edmund Ware] inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

They were officially led by [[Alessandro Pavolini]], former Minister of Culture (MINCULPOP) of the fascist era during the last years of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nOn 26 July 1943 Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], was arrested after the Italian [[Grand Council of Fascism]] (''Gran Consiglio del Fascismo''), with the support of King [[Victor Emmanuel III|Vittorio Emanuele III]], overthrew him and began negotiations with the Allies for Italy's withdrawal from the war. The Italian government was taken over by Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]], who outlawed the [[National Fascist Party]] (''Partito Nazionale Fascista'', PNF) and confiscated all of its assets.\n\nOn 12 September Mussolini was rescued in the [[Gran Sasso raid]] by German [[Luftwaffe#Luftwaffe ground forces|Luftwaffe]] [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]] (paratroopers) led by General [[Kurt Student]] and the [[Waffen-SS]] ''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' (Lieutenant Colonel), [[Otto Skorzeny]]. He was then installed by the Germans as the President of the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI). The RSI was to be an Italian regime which was to nominally administer the German-occupied northern Italy.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Blackbrigadesposter.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A recruitment poster for the Black Brigades, urging Italians to \"fight for the honour of Italy\"]] -->\nAs the ''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'' (MVSN, also known as \"[[Blackshirts]]\", ''Camicie Nere'') had been disbanded in August by the terms of the armistice, the ''[[Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana]]'' was formed on 24 November 1943, and was to constitute the new fascist police force. The ''Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana'' was formed out of local police, ex-army, ex-Blackshirts and others still loyal to the [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] cause.<ref>G. Pansa, Il Gladio e l'Alloro - l'esercito di Sal\u00f2, ed. Le Scie- Milano 1991</ref>\n\n[[Anti-fascism|Anti-fascist]] political forces in [[Northern Italy]], on their side, decided to oppose in arms against the RSI and the German occupants, and began to recruit armed clandestine formations for guerrilla and urban warfare, with support from the Allies. Soon, a bloody civil war started in northern Italy.<ref>I. Montanelli - R. Gervaso, Storia d'Italia 1943-46, ed. Mondadori, Milano 1967</ref>\n\n===Constitution===\nHowever, as soon as the fascist party in the RSI was reopened and reorganized as [[Republican Fascist Party]] (''Partito Fascista Repubblicano'' - PFR), its members began to organize \"private\" armed units, to protect themselves and party officials from attacks by Italian resistance fighters, who actually started very soon to target RSI authorities and supporters. RSI manpower proved to be insufficient, and Italian authorities decided to organize all fascist party volunteer units in a dedicated structure, and to raise new forces.<ref>G. Pansa, Il Gladio e l'Alloro - l'esercito di Sal\u00f2, ed. Le Scie- Milano 1991</ref><ref>I. Montanelli - R. Gervaso, Storia d'Italia 1943-46, ed. Mondadori, Milano 1967</ref>\nThe Black Brigades were formed from members of the Republican Fascist Party. Formation of the Black Brigades was sanctioned by a Fascist Republican Party decree issued personally by Benito Mussolini, head of PFR and of the RSI government, dated 30 June 1944, stating that all existing fascist armed units were to be enlisted into a military organization called ''Corpo Ausiliario delle Squadre d'Azione di Camicie Nere'', and that every local Federation of the PFR (there was one in every Italian province) had to raise a military unit drafting personnel from its members. Units so formed were to be called \"Black Brigades\", and were to be commanded by the local Federal Secretary of the PFR, with the rank of Major or Colonel.<ref>Giampaolo Pansa, ''Il gladio e l'alloro - l'esercito di Sal\u00f2, 1943-45</ref>\n[[File:Brigata Nera alpina 1945.jpg|thumb|Mussolini reviews 5th Alpine Mobile Black Brigade \"''E. Quagliata''\", [[Brescia]], 1945. Note the ''[[Alpini]]'' hat and the green flashes on the soldiers' black collar tabs, both distinctive insignias of Italian mountain troops.]]\nTheir duties were:\n* to provide security for the members and assets of the PFR;\n* to cooperate with German and Italian law enforcement authorities;\n* to help military authorities in counter-insurgency operations.<ref>Giampaolo Pansa, ''Il gladio e l'alloro - l'esercito di Sal\u00f2, 1943-45</ref>\n\nThis measure was to be both a response to resistance attacks against fascist members, and to turn the PFR into a fighting force to cope with shortage of manpower for internal security.<ref>G. Pisan\u00f2, gli ultimi in grigioverde, vol. I-II-II</ref> Moreover, Mussolini and other fascist leaders felt that the Fascist Party was more true to its ideology if brought back to its original spirit, when it was manned mainly by soldiers and veterans and was above all a fighting organization. In this optic, they decided to mobilize it for war duties, under the concept that every fascist was to be first of all a combatant, and had to take arms for the defense of Italy and fascism.<ref>G. Pisan\u00f2, gli ultimi in grigioverde, vol. I-II-II</ref>\nBlack Brigades membership was compulsory for all members of the PFR deemed fit for such duties. Members were officially called ''Squadristi'' (Squad-men) (like the very first fascist Black Shirts of 1920s), and were divided into three categories: ''Squadristi Permanenti'' (Full-time squad-men), ''Ausiliari di pronto impiego'' (Ready Response Auxiliaries), ''Ausiliari'' (Auxiliaries). Only full-time personnel were required to be on duty daily, while other two categories were to be mobilized only in case of emergency.<ref>G. Pisan\u00f2, gli ultimi in grigioverde, vol. I-II-II</ref>\nBlack Brigade members were entitled to police powers, to carry firearms and to circulate freely even during curfew. Full-time personnel received a monthly wage of ITL 200.00.<ref>G. Rosignoli, RSI - uniformi, equipaggiamenti ed armi</ref>\n\n===Operational service===\nPolice effectiveness of Black Brigades was, in best terms, feeble. Aside from particularly strong and well equipped Brigades (such as VIIIth \"Aldo Resega\" of Milan, 2000 strong) that were exceptions, the average Black Brigades were at most 2-300 men strong, poorly equipped and armed, with little if any military training, and were hardly in conditions to defend themselves from partisan attacks, not to mention provide support to military authorities.<ref>G. Rosignoli, RSI - uniformi, equipaggiamenti ed armi</ref>\n[[File:Brigata nera mantova.jpg|thumbnail|The Black Brigade \"''Marcello Turchetti''\" of [[Mantua]], before one of its last actions in the closing days of war, April 1945]]\nMany of their members were obscure figures evicted from police or army, and conspicuous were also the hardline fascists who were pushed by resentment and revenge towards that part of Italian population who, in their eyes, betrayed the Fascist regime. Many were also old \"Squadristi\" fascists who had served in the '20s, and who were eager to retake a first-place role in the ranks of the Fascist Party. In general terms, poor average discipline made all these individuals difficult to control, and prone to abuses.\nAs the military situation worsened, German mistrust towards the [[Repubblica Sociale Italiana|RSI]] military grew, and even Social Republic authorities looked at the Black Brigades with contempt. All these factors contributed to push the Black Brigades into political radicalization and an increasingly hostile behaviour towards the population itself, among which they gained a fearsome reputation of fanatical brutality and summary procedures.\nApart from a few Black Brigades who had been found reliable enough to be committed in regular combat against Partisans and Allies, most of these formations had poor military or even police capabilities and were mainly employed in static guard duties, patrols, and were often unleashed in brutal reprisals and retaliations against Partisans' attacks and ambushes to RSI military personnel.<ref>I. Montanelli - R. Gervaso, Storia d'Italia 1943-46, ed. Mondadori, Milano 1967</ref> \n\nThe Brigade members not only fought the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the Italian [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]], but they also fought against political opponents and other Black Brigade members whose support of \"the cause\" was deemed less than exuberant. Many Black Brigade members were killed in this type of in-fighting.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAfter the armistice (April 25, 1945) and the end of the war in Italy, many members of the Black Brigades suffered harsh reprisals from Partisan forces.\n\n===War crimes===\nThe Black Brigades were frequently involved in support of German units during anti-partisan operations which resulted in massacres of the Italian civilian population, like at the [[Vinca massacre]] where 162 civilians were executed where the 40. Brigata near \u201cVittorio Ricciarelli\u201d di Livorno was involved.<ref name= \"Vinca\" >{{cite web |url=http://www.straginazifasciste.it/?page_id=38&id_strage=4857&lang=en |title=VINCA FIVIZZANO 24-27.08.1944 |publisher=Atlas of Nazi and Fascist Massacres in Italy |date= |website= |access-date=25 August 2018 |language=Italian |trans-title=}}</ref>\n\n==Uniforms==\nMembers of Black Brigades were issued standard Italian army uniforms, and they tended to wear them with a black [[turtleneck]] sweater, or (in summer) the famous black shirt, as the symbol of loyalty to Mussolini and membership of the Republican Fascist Party. They sometimes wore this uniform with a windproof jacket in solid or camouflage colors. Members of Black Brigades tended to wear the grey-green uniform pants, but a wide array of uniforms were issued and, especially in closing stages of the war, Black Brigades members used just anything they could obtain: army camouflaged one-piece suits, smocks and pants, paratroopers' collarless jump jackets (very popular), tropical Italian army uniforms, German pants and ''feldjacken'', and frequently local produced uniforms and gear.<ref>Guido Rosignoli, ''RSI - Uniformi, equipaggiamento e armi'' - Ed. Albertelli, Parma 1991</ref>\n\n[[File:Black Brigades Soldiers.jpg|thumb|200px|Soldiers in Black Brigades, holding submachine guns.

Also, armed with a British [[Sten]] MkII, submachine gun, likely from an intercepted British, small arms, airdrop or took in battle.]]\n[[File:Black Brigades Skull Insignias.png|thumbnail|200px|Skull hat insignia, worn with the black, [[Italian Army]]-issue uniforms, by soldiers of the Black Brigades]]\n[[File:Black Brigades Beret.jpg|thumb|150px|Black Brigades [[Italian Army]]-issued, [[military beret|beret]], with skull insignia]]\n[[File:Black Brigades Helmet.jpg|thumb|150px|Black Brigades [[Italian Army]]-issued, black, \"Marcello\", [[M33 helmet|M33]], steel, helmet, with white skull markings]]\n\nThe badge or insignia of the Black Brigades was the jawless [[Totenkopf|death's head]], with a dagger in its teeth, or one of assorted Italian versions. Collar tabs were issued, unique to the Black Brigades, consisting in square-shaped tabs with pointed tip, of solid black cloth, on which was pinned a bright red republican fascio, in the lower part. In the upper part, every Brigade chose its own insignia: either one of the many variants of skulls (with or without crossbones) or coloured facing. Regulations prescribed for all members of the Black Brigades to wear a metal enamelled breast badge, of roundel shape, showing a golden fascio amidst Italian national colours in vertical stripes, and surrounded by a black enamel rim with the inscription: \"Corpo Ausiliario delle Squadre d'Azione di Camicie Nere\", in capital letters, and in the lower part the identification number of the Brigade. Contemporary pictures show that this badge however, although certainly issued on large scale, was not so often worn.\n\nMany Black Brigades adopted sleeve badges, following Italian military tradition, both cloth and metal. These were usually of very fine workmanship, often minted and enamelled, and are today high-priced collectors items. Rank insignias were the same of those prescribed for the Italian army; however, were rarely worn. Towards the end of the war a specific rank system was introduced for the Black Brigades, unique to them, but it does not seem to have ever been implemented.<ref>Guido Rosignoli, ''RSI - Uniformi, equipaggiamento e armi'' - Ed. Albertelli, Parma 1991</ref>\n\nThe majority of Black Brigade members wore Italian army ski caps or berets dyed black. Some photos show members also wearing black German-style caps. Some were Italian made, some were supplied by Germany. Combat headgear was the ubiquitous M33 olive-green helmet, sometimes adorned with Black Brigades' skull insignia. German M35 helmets were also used, ando so were M33 black MVSN helmets. Helmets were often sprayed with various camouflage pattern, as was very common in that period. Combat gear and carrying equipment was the same of army soldiers. ''Samurai'' magazine vest, originally intended for elite army units, was widely used and so were a vast sorting of pouches, magazine-holders, holsters, both official issue (Italian or German) and privately made, carried on Italian M1908 olive-green leather carrying equipment.<ref>Guido Rosignoli, ''RSI - Uniformi, equipaggiamento e armi'' - Ed. Albertelli, Parma 1991</ref>\n\n==Ranks==\n{{main|Military ranks of the Italian Social Republic}}\n\nThe Black Brigades wore a simple [[fourrag\u00e8re]] denoting rank.<ref>P.Marzetti (1981).

The Italian word ''brigata'' has a looser meaning as a synonym of \"group\" or \"assembly\". The Black Brigades were typically weak [[battalion]]s or strong [[Company (military unit)|companies]], each comprising 200 to 300 men. There were 41 territorial brigades. The territorial brigades were numbered 1 through 41. There were also seven \"independent\" and eight \"mobile\" brigades.

They were officially led by [[Alessandro Pavolini]], former Minister of Culture (MINCULPOP) of the fascist era during the last years of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Background===\nOn 26 July 1943 Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], was arrested after the Italian [[Grand Council of Fascism]] (''Gran Consiglio del Fascismo''), with the support of King [[Victor Emmanuel III|Vittorio Emanuele III]], overthrew him and began negotiations with the Allies for Italy's withdrawal from the war. The Italian government was taken over by Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]], who outlawed the [[National Fascist Party]] (''Partito Nazionale Fascista'', PNF) and confiscated all of its assets.\n\nOn 12 September Mussolini was rescued in the [[Gran Sasso raid]] by German [[Luftwaffe#Luftwaffe ground forces|Luftwaffe]] [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]] (paratroopers) led by General [[Kurt Student]] and the [[Waffen-SS]] ''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' (Lieutenant Colonel), [[Otto Skorzeny]]. He was then installed by the Germans as the President of the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI). The RSI was to be an Italian regime which was to nominally administer the German-occupied northern Italy.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Blackbrigadesposter.JPG|thumb|200px|left|A recruitment poster for the Black Brigades, urging Italians to \"fight for the honour of Italy\"]] -->\nAs the ''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'' (MVSN, also known as \"[[Blackshirts]]\", ''Camicie Nere'') had been disbanded in August by the terms of the armistice, the ''[[Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana]]'' was formed on 24 November 1943, and was to constitute the new fascist police force. The ''Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana'' was formed out of local police, ex-army, ex-Blackshirts and others still loyal to the [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] cause.<ref>G. Pansa, Il Gladio e l'Alloro - l'esercito di Sal\u00f2, ed. Le Scie- Milano 1991</ref>\n\n[[Anti-fascism|Anti-fascist]] political forces in [[Northern Italy]], on their side, decided to oppose in arms against the RSI and the German occupants, and began to recruit armed clandestine formations for guerrilla and urban warfare, with support from the Allies. Soon, a bloody civil war started in northern Italy.<ref>I. Montanelli - R. Gervaso, Storia d'Italia 1943-46, ed. Mondadori, Milano 1967</ref>\n\n===Constitution===\nHowever, as soon as the fascist party in the RSI was reopened and reorganized as [[Republican Fascist Party]] (''Partito Fascista Repubblicano'' - PFR), its members began to organize \"private\" armed units, to protect themselves and party officials from attacks by Italian resistance fighters, who actually started very soon to target RSI authorities and supporters. RSI manpower proved to be insufficient, and Italian authorities decided to organize all fascist party volunteer units in a dedicated structure, and to raise new forces.<ref>G. Pansa, Il Gladio e l'Alloro - l'esercito di Sal\u00f2, ed. Le Scie- Milano 1991</ref><ref>I. Montanelli - R. Gervaso, Storia d'Italia 1943-46, ed. Mondadori, Milano 1967</ref>\nThe Black Brigades were formed from members of the Republican Fascist Party. Formation of the Black Brigades was sanctioned by a Fascist Republican Party decree issued personally by Benito Mussolini, head of PFR and of the RSI government, dated 30 June 1944, stating that all existing fascist armed units were to be enlisted into a military organization called ''Corpo Ausiliario delle Squadre d'Azione di Camicie Nere'', and that every local Federation of the PFR (there was one in every Italian province) had to raise a military unit drafting personnel from its members. Units so formed were to be called \"Black Brigades\", and were to be commanded by the local Federal Secretary of the PFR, with the rank of Major or Colonel.<ref>Giampaolo Pansa, ''Il gladio e l'alloro - l'esercito di Sal\u00f2, 1943-45</ref>\n[[File:Brigata Nera alpina 1945.jpg|thumb|Mussolini reviews 5th Alpine Mobile Black Brigade \"''E. Quagliata''\", [[Brescia]], 1945. Note the ''[[Alpini]]'' hat and the green flashes on the soldiers' black collar tabs, both distinctive insignias of Italian mountain troops.]]\nTheir duties were:\n* to provide security for the members and assets of the PFR;\n* to cooperate with German and Italian law enforcement authorities;\n* to help military authorities in counter-insurgency operations.<ref>Giampaolo Pansa, ''Il gladio e l'alloro - l'esercito di Sal\u00f2, 1943-45</ref>\n\nThis measure was to be both a response to resistance attacks against fascist members, and to turn the PFR into a fighting force to cope with shortage of manpower for internal security.<ref>G. Pisan\u00f2, gli ultimi in grigioverde, vol. I-II-II</ref> Moreover, Mussolini and other fascist leaders felt that the Fascist Party was more true to its ideology if brought back to its original spirit, when it was manned mainly by soldiers and veterans and was above all a fighting organization. In this optic, they decided to mobilize it for war duties, under the concept that every fascist was to be first of all a combatant, and had to take arms for the defense of Italy and fascism.<ref>G. Pisan\u00f2, gli ultimi in grigioverde, vol. I-II-II</ref>\nBlack Brigades membership was compulsory for all members of the PFR deemed fit for such duties. Members were officially called ''Squadristi'' (Squad-men) (like the very first fascist Black Shirts of 1920s), and were divided into three categories: ''Squadristi Permanenti'' (Full-time squad-men), ''Ausiliari di pronto impiego'' (Ready Response Auxiliaries), ''Ausiliari'' (Auxiliaries). Only full-time personnel were required to be on duty daily, while other two categories were to be mobilized only in case of emergency.<ref>G. Pisan\u00f2, gli ultimi in grigioverde, vol. I-II-II</ref>\nBlack Brigade members were entitled to police powers, to carry firearms and to circulate freely even during curfew. Full-time personnel received a monthly wage of ITL 200.00.<ref>G. Rosignoli, RSI - uniformi, equipaggiamenti ed armi</ref>\n\n===Operational service===\nPolice effectiveness of Black Brigades was, in best terms, feeble. Aside from particularly strong and well equipped Brigades (such as VIIIth \"Aldo Resega\" of Milan, 2000 strong) that were exceptions, the average Black Brigades were at most 2-300 men strong, poorly equipped and armed, with little if any military training, and were hardly in conditions to defend themselves from partisan attacks, not to mention provide support to military authorities.<ref>G. Rosignoli, RSI - uniformi, equipaggiamenti ed armi</ref>\n[[File:Brigata nera mantova.jpg|thumbnail|The Black Brigade \"''Marcello Turchetti''\" of [[Mantua]], before one of its last actions in the closing days of war, April 1945]]\nMany of their members were obscure figures evicted from police or army, and conspicuous were also the hardline fascists who were pushed by resentment and revenge towards that part of Italian population who, in their eyes, betrayed the Fascist regime. Many were also old \"Squadristi\" fascists who had served in the '20s, and who were eager to retake a first-place role in the ranks of the Fascist Party. In general terms, poor average discipline made all these individuals difficult to control, and prone to abuses.\nAs the military situation worsened, German mistrust towards the [[Repubblica Sociale Italiana|RSI]] military grew, and even Social Republic authorities looked at the Black Brigades with contempt. All these factors contributed to push the Black Brigades into political radicalization and an increasingly hostile behaviour towards the population itself, among which they gained a fearsome reputation of fanatical brutality and summary procedures.\nApart from a few Black Brigades who had been found reliable enough to be committed in regular combat against Partisans and Allies, most of these formations had poor military or even police capabilities and were mainly employed in static guard duties, patrols, and were often unleashed in brutal reprisals and retaliations against Partisans' attacks and ambushes to RSI military personnel.<ref>I. Montanelli - R. Gervaso, Storia d'Italia 1943-46, ed. Mondadori, Milano 1967</ref> \n\nThe Brigade members not only fought the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the Italian [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]], but they also fought against political opponents and other Black Brigade members whose support of \"the cause\" was deemed less than exuberant. Many Black Brigade members were killed in this type of in-fighting.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAfter the armistice (April 25, 1945) and the end of the war in Italy, many members of the Black Brigades suffered harsh reprisals from Partisan forces.\n\n===War crimes===\nThe Black Brigades were frequently involved in support of German units during anti-partisan operations which resulted in massacres of the Italian civilian population, like at the [[Vinca massacre]] where 162 civilians were executed where the 40. Brigata near \u201cVittorio Ricciarelli\u201d di Livorno was involved.<ref name= \"Vinca\" >{{cite web |url=http://www.straginazifasciste.it/?page_id=38&id_strage=4857&lang=en |title=VINCA FIVIZZANO 24-27.08.1944 |publisher=Atlas of Nazi and Fascist Massacres in Italy |date= |website= |access-date=25 August 2018 |language=Italian |trans-title=}}</ref>\n\n==Uniforms==\nMembers of Black Brigades were issued standard Italian army uniforms, and they tended to wear them with a black [[turtleneck]] sweater, or (in summer) the famous black shirt, as the symbol of loyalty to Mussolini and membership of the Republican Fascist Party. They sometimes wore this uniform with a windproof jacket in solid or camouflage colors. Members of Black Brigades tended to wear the grey-green uniform pants, but a wide array of uniforms were issued and, especially in closing stages of the war, Black Brigades members used just anything they could obtain: army camouflaged one-piece suits, smocks and pants, paratroopers' collarless jump jackets (very popular), tropical Italian army uniforms, German pants and ''feldjacken'', and frequently local produced uniforms and gear.<ref>Guido Rosignoli, ''RSI - Uniformi, equipaggiamento e armi'' - Ed. Albertelli, Parma 1991</ref>\n\n[[File:Black Brigades Soldiers.jpg|thumb|200px|Soldiers in Black Brigades, holding submachine guns.

Also, armed with a British [[Sten]] MkII, submachine gun, likely from an intercepted British, small arms, airdrop or took in battle.]]\n[[File:Black Brigades Skull Insignias.png|thumbnail|200px|Skull hat insignia, worn with the black, [[Italian Army]]-issue uniforms, by soldiers of the Black Brigades]]\n[[File:Black Brigades Beret.jpg|thumb|150px|Black Brigades [[Italian Army]]-issued, [[military beret|beret]], with skull insignia]]\n[[File:Black Brigades Helmet.jpg|thumb|150px|Black Brigades [[Italian Army]]-issued, black, \"Marcello\", [[M33 helmet|M33]], steel, helmet, with white skull markings]]\n\nThe badge or insignia of the Black Brigades was the jawless [[Totenkopf|death's head]], with a dagger in its teeth, or one of assorted Italian versions. Collar tabs were issued, unique to the Black Brigades, consisting in square-shaped tabs with pointed tip, of solid black cloth, on which was pinned a bright red republican fascio, in the lower part. In the upper part, every Brigade chose its own insignia: either one of the many variants of skulls (with or without crossbones) or coloured facing. Regulations prescribed for all members of the Black Brigades to wear a metal enamelled breast badge, of roundel shape, showing a golden fascio amidst Italian national colours in vertical stripes, and surrounded by a black enamel rim with the inscription: \"Corpo Ausiliario delle Squadre d'Azione di Camicie Nere\", in capital letters, and in the lower part the identification number of the Brigade. Contemporary pictures show that this badge however, although certainly issued on large scale, was not so often worn.\n\nMany Black Brigades adopted sleeve badges, following Italian military tradition, both cloth and metal. These were usually of very fine workmanship, often minted and enamelled, and are today high-priced collectors items. Rank insignias were the same of those prescribed for the Italian army; however, were rarely worn. Towards the end of the war a specific rank system was introduced for the Black Brigades, unique to them, but it does not seem to have ever been implemented.<ref>Guido Rosignoli, ''RSI - Uniformi, equipaggiamento e armi'' - Ed. Albertelli, Parma 1991</ref>\n\nThe majority of Black Brigade members wore Italian army ski caps or berets dyed black. Some photos show members also wearing black German-style caps. Some were Italian made, some were supplied by Germany. Combat headgear was the ubiquitous M33 olive-green helmet, sometimes adorned with Black Brigades' skull insignia. German M35 helmets were also used, ando so were M33 black MVSN helmets. Helmets were often sprayed with various camouflage pattern, as was very common in that period. Combat gear and carrying equipment was the same of army soldiers. ''Samurai'' magazine vest, originally intended for elite army units, was widely used and so were a vast sorting of pouches, magazine-holders, holsters, both official issue (Italian or German) and privately made, carried on Italian M1908 olive-green leather carrying equipment.<ref>Guido Rosignoli, ''RSI - Uniformi, equipaggiamento e armi'' - Ed. Albertelli, Parma 1991</ref>\n\n==Ranks==\n{{main|Military ranks of the Italian Social Republic}}\n\nThe Black Brigades wore a simple [[fourrag\u00e8re]] denoting rank.<ref>P.Marzetti (1981).

The Italian word ''brigata'' has a looser meaning as a synonym of \"group\" or \"assembly\". The Black Brigades were typically weak [[battalion]]s or strong [[Company (military unit)|companies]], each comprising 200 to 300 men. There were 41 territorial brigades. The territorial brigades were numbered 1 through 41. There were also seven \"independent\" and eight \"mobile\" brigades.

Air Wing 134 is stationed at Sola along with helicopter Squadron [[No. 330 Squadron RNoAF|330]].\n\nAlso located at Sola is [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]] and an aviation museum.  Near Sola, at [[J\u00e5tt\u00e5]] in [[Stavanger]] is [[NATO]]s [[Joint Warfare Center]].\n\n==Operations==\n[[No. 330 Squadron RNoAF|330 Squadron]] operates [[Westland Helicopters|Westland]] [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters. The 12 helicopters are also detached to [[Rygge Air Station]], [[\u00d8rland Main Air Station]], [[Bod\u00f8 Main Air Station]] and [[Banak Air Station]], with one helicopter on stand-by at any given time.\n\n==History==\n\n===Opening===\nSola Air Station was founded at May 29, 1937 by [[King Haakon VII]], and an air show with 42 aircraft marked the occasion. In 1939, it was decided to station military aircraft on the airfield (because of the tense situation unfolding in Europe at the time). August 5, 1939, the first [[Caproni Ca.310]] bomber landed here.\n\n===Operation Weser\u00fcbung===\nOn April 9, 1940, in reaction to the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[invasion of Norway]], the bomber squadron was ordered to the east, but before they could take off, six [[Nazi Germany|German]] aircraft attacked. The bombers were damaged, only a few getting airborne to later be abandoned elsewhere and the airport was seized. Here, the first opposed landing by [[paratroopers]] took place as 132 German [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]s from 1st battalion of the 1st Regiment, [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|7th Flieger Division]] were dropped on the airfield. Around 3 fallschirmj\u00e4gers became casualties as the air station's sole completed [[heavy machine gun|machine gun]] [[bunker]] fired on the attackers until being knocked out by a [[hand grenade]], seriously wounding the gunner.\n\nDuring the German occupation, the [[Luftwaffe|German Air Force]] used the facility's seaplane base for operations in support of [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] ships based on the Norwegian coast.  [[Bordfliegergruppe 196#1st Squadron|Embarked Air Squadron 1/196]] made three partial deployments to the facility in 1940 and 1941 before the entire squadron was based there through April and May 1944, after which part of the squadron would remain until into July 1944.<ref name=\"Kleckers\">{{cite web|last=Kleckers|first=Axel|last2=Grams|first2=Christian|url=http://www.luftwaffe-zur-see.de/Seeluft/196%20Bordfliegergruppe/Gruppe_196.htm|title=Bordfliegergruppe 196|access-date=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Liberation and post-war===\nThe next paratrooper landing at Sola took place May 9, 1945. This time, it was [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] troops that recaptured the airfield. \n[[File:Northrop F-5A 67-14896 RNoAF YVTN 17.07.71 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Northrop F-5A of 718 Squadron based at Sola in the early 1970s]]\n330 Squadron was the first Norwegian squadron to land after the war. The squadron had been founded in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the war and Sola was the first airfield to host Norwegian war-planes after the war. Squadron 330 was later disbanded, but the airfield remained as the biggest military airfield in the country up to the 1960s.\n\nIn early 1946, [[No. 333 Squadron RAF|333 Squadron]] came here, but it was moved to [[Troms\u00f8]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1953 it came back, but left for [[And\u00f8ya Air Station|And\u00f8ya]] in 1963. 331 Squadron came in 1952.

Air Wing 134 is stationed at Sola along with helicopter Squadron [[No. 330 Squadron RNoAF|330]].\n\nAlso located at Sola is [[Stavanger Airport, Sola]] and an aviation museum.  Near Sola, at [[J\u00e5tt\u00e5]] in [[Stavanger]] is [[NATO]]s [[Joint Warfare Center]].\n\n==Operations==\n[[No. 330 Squadron RNoAF|330 Squadron]] operates [[Westland Helicopters|Westland]] [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] [[search and rescue]] helicopters. The 12 helicopters are also detached to [[Rygge Air Station]], [[\u00d8rland Main Air Station]], [[Bod\u00f8 Main Air Station]] and [[Banak Air Station]], with one helicopter on stand-by at any given time.\n\n==History==\n\n===Opening===\nSola Air Station was founded at May 29, 1937 by [[King Haakon VII]], and an air show with 42 aircraft marked the occasion. In 1939, it was decided to station military aircraft on the airfield (because of the tense situation unfolding in Europe at the time). August 5, 1939, the first [[Caproni Ca.310]] bomber landed here.\n\n===Operation Weser\u00fcbung===\nOn April 9, 1940, in reaction to the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[invasion of Norway]], the bomber squadron was ordered to the east, but before they could take off, six [[Nazi Germany|German]] aircraft attacked. The bombers were damaged, only a few getting airborne to later be abandoned elsewhere and the airport was seized. Here, the first opposed landing by [[paratroopers]] took place as 132 German [[fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]s from 1st battalion of the 1st Regiment, [[1st Parachute Division (Germany)|7th Flieger Division]] were dropped on the airfield. Around 3 fallschirmj\u00e4gers became casualties as the air station's sole completed [[heavy machine gun|machine gun]] [[bunker]] fired on the attackers until being knocked out by a [[hand grenade]], seriously wounding the gunner.\n\nDuring the German occupation, the [[Luftwaffe|German Air Force]] used the facility's seaplane base for operations in support of [[Kriegsmarine|German Navy]] ships based on the Norwegian coast.  [[Bordfliegergruppe 196#1st Squadron|Embarked Air Squadron 1/196]] made three partial deployments to the facility in 1940 and 1941 before the entire squadron was based there through April and May 1944, after which part of the squadron would remain until into July 1944.<ref name=\"Kleckers\">{{cite web|last=Kleckers|first=Axel|last2=Grams|first2=Christian|url=http://www.luftwaffe-zur-see.de/Seeluft/196%20Bordfliegergruppe/Gruppe_196.htm|title=Bordfliegergruppe 196|access-date=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Liberation and post-war===\nThe next paratrooper landing at Sola took place May 9, 1945. This time, it was [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] troops that recaptured the airfield. \n[[File:Northrop F-5A 67-14896 RNoAF YVTN 17.07.71 edited-2.jpg|thumb|right|Northrop F-5A of 718 Squadron based at Sola in the early 1970s]]\n330 Squadron was the first Norwegian squadron to land after the war. The squadron had been founded in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the war and Sola was the first airfield to host Norwegian war-planes after the war. Squadron 330 was later disbanded, but the airfield remained as the biggest military airfield in the country up to the 1960s.\n\nIn early 1946, [[No. 333 Squadron RAF|333 Squadron]] came here, but it was moved to [[Troms\u00f8]] during the [[Korean War]]. In 1953 it came back, but left for [[And\u00f8ya Air Station|And\u00f8ya]] in 1963. 331 Squadron came in 1952. It was later disbanded and reformed until it moved to [[Bod\u00f8 Main Air Station|Bod\u00f8]] in 1955. 718 Squadron was formed here in 1952 and during the 1970s operated the [[Northrop F-5]] fighter. The squadron remained until it was disbanded in 1982.\n\nSola Air Station has been considered to be closed, but will continue as a base for maritime helicopter operations.\n\n===NATO Use===\nThe [[United States Air Force]] 426th Air Base Squadron provides support to 220 U.S. service members and their families working in support of NATO\u2019s Joint Warfare Center.
