LOD was active from the 1980s to the early 2000s, although was most active from 1984\u20131991 and at the time was considered to be the most capable hacking group in the world.  Today, Legion of Doom ranks as one of the more influential hacking groups in the history of technology, appearing to be a reference to the antagonists of ''[[Challenge of the Super Friends]]''.\n\nAt different points in the group's history, LOD was split into LOD and LOD/LOH (Legion of Doom/Legion of Hackers) for the members that were more skilled at hacking than pure [[phreaking]].\n\nThere was a second hacking group at the time, called MOD, short for the [[Masters of Deception]]. The overall beliefs of LOD and MOD ([[Masters of Deception]]) were different, but it can be difficult to untangle the actions of the members since there was a cross-over between the two groups. Unlike the hacking group MOD, there were different opinions regarding what the Legion of Doom was. LOD published the ''Legion of Doom Technical Journals'' and contributed to the overall pool of hacking knowledge. They were not causing any direct harm to the phone systems and computer networks they took over. Still, at the time, any tampering with the phone systems was considered damaging, and many LOD members were raided and prosecuted for causing alleged damage to systems (Grant, Darden and Riggs, etc.).\n\n==History==\nDuring the summer of 1984, a year after the movie WarGames was released, an idea was formulated that would ultimately change the face of the computer underground forever.  This particular summer, a huge surge of interest in computer telecommunications placed an incredibly large number of new enthusiasts on the national computer scene. This crowd of people all seeking to learn as much as possible began to put a strain on the bulletin board (FIDO) scene, as the novices stormed the phonelines in search of knowledge.  From out of this chaos came a need for knowledgeable instructors to teach information to the new users.\n\nIn 1984, one of the most popular bulletin boards of the day was a system in New York state called [[Plover-NET]], which was run by a person who called himself Quasi-Moto.  This BBS was so heavily trafficked that a major long distance company began blocking all calls to its number (516-935-2481). The co-sysop of Plovernet was a person known as Lex Luthor.  At the time there were a few hacking groups in existence, such as [[Fargo 4A]] and Knights of Shadow, but the Legion of Doom was considered the most technically adept. Lex joined KOS in early 1984, but after a few suggestions about new members were rejected, Lex decided to put up an invitation-only BBS and form a new group. Lex contacted those people who he had seen on BBSes such as [[Plover-NET]] and the people that he knew personally who possessed the necessary knowledge that the group he envisioned should have, starting around May 1984.  After a number of Alliance Teleconferences, Lex Luthor, Karl Marx, Mark Tabas, Agrajag the Prolonged, King Blotto, Blue Archer, EBA, The Dragyn, and Unknown Soldier became the original Legion of Doom members.<ref name=\"phrackhistory\"/>\n\n==Members of LOD==\n[[File:Legion of Doom Hacking for Jesus T-Shirt.png|thumb|right|200px|1991 Legion of Doom T-shirt created by [[Chris Goggans]] \"Erik Bloodaxe\"]]\nAs of 2012 what has happened to each individual member of the Legion of Doom is unknown.

This deputation was not allowed to enter Athens, as Pericles had already passed a resolution according to which no Spartan deputation would be welcomed if the Spartans had previously initiated any hostile military actions.

In Athens, the community provided a tight framework for religious manifestations while, symmetrically, religion was deeply embedded in civic life. Within this context, participation in the rituals was an action highly political in the broadest sense of the term.<ref>Sourvinou-Inwood, C. 1990. ''What is polis religion?'' in ''The Greek City from Homer to Alexander'', ed. O. Murray and S. Price. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 295\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo analyze Pericles's relations with gods, one has to position oneself at the intersection of the general and the particular, where what was personal and what was shared by the whole community came together. On the one hand, the career of the ''strategos'' will illuminate the Athenians' collective relationship to all that was divine. As a reelected ''strategos'' and a persuasive orator, Pericles was the spokesman of a civic religion that was undergoing a mutation. He was implicated in a policy of making constant offerings and of launching huge architectural religious works not only on the Acropolis but also throughout Attica; and, furthermore, he was engaged in such activities at a time when city was introducing profound changes into its religious account of its origins\u2014that is, [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthony]]\u2014within a context of strained diplomatic relations.<ref>Vincent Azoulay, 2014. ''Pericles of Athens'', trans. Janet Lloyd. Princeton and Oxford, 107\u2013108</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the ancient sources made it possible to glimpse the personal relations that Pericles had developed with gods. These were relations of proximity in the first place: he was sometimes depicted as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Athena|goddess Athena]], but in Attic comedies he was also assimilated to [[Zeus god of war|god Zeus]], in an analogy that was in no way flattering. But then, there were also relations that emphasized distance: some philosophical accounts presented him as a man close to the [[sophists]] or even as a [[freethinker]]. Finally, there were relations involving irreverence: some later and less trustworthy sources made much of several trials for impiety in which those close to him were involved, and this raises the question of religious tolerance in fifth-century Athens and, in particular, how far individuals enjoyed freedom of thought when faced with the civic community.<ref>Vincent Azoulay, 2014. ''Pericles of Athens'', trans. Janet Lloyd. Princeton and Oxford, 108.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\n[[File:Akropolis by Leo von Klenze.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Acropolis at Athens'' (1846) by [[Leo von Klenze]]]]\n\nPericles' most visible legacy can be found in the literary and artistic works of the Golden Age, much of which survive to this day. The Acropolis, though in ruins, still stands and is a symbol of modern Athens. Paparrigopoulos wrote that these masterpieces are \"sufficient to render the name of Greece immortal in our world\".<ref name=\"Pap\" />\n\nIn politics, Victor L.

In Athens, the community provided a tight framework for religious manifestations while, symmetrically, religion was deeply embedded in civic life. Within this context, participation in the rituals was an action highly political in the broadest sense of the term.<ref>Sourvinou-Inwood, C. 1990. ''What is polis religion?'' in ''The Greek City from Homer to Alexander'', ed. O. Murray and S. Price. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 295\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo analyze Pericles's relations with gods, one has to position oneself at the intersection of the general and the particular, where what was personal and what was shared by the whole community came together. On the one hand, the career of the ''strategos'' will illuminate the Athenians' collective relationship to all that was divine. As a reelected ''strategos'' and a persuasive orator, Pericles was the spokesman of a civic religion that was undergoing a mutation. He was implicated in a policy of making constant offerings and of launching huge architectural religious works not only on the Acropolis but also throughout Attica; and, furthermore, he was engaged in such activities at a time when city was introducing profound changes into its religious account of its origins\u2014that is, [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthony]]\u2014within a context of strained diplomatic relations.<ref>Vincent Azoulay, 2014. ''Pericles of Athens'', trans. Janet Lloyd. Princeton and Oxford, 107\u2013108</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, the ancient sources made it possible to glimpse the personal relations that Pericles had developed with gods. These were relations of proximity in the first place: he was sometimes depicted as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Athena|goddess Athena]], but in Attic comedies he was also assimilated to [[Zeus god of war|god Zeus]], in an analogy that was in no way flattering. But then, there were also relations that emphasized distance: some philosophical accounts presented him as a man close to the [[sophists]] or even as a [[freethinker]]. Finally, there were relations involving irreverence: some later and less trustworthy sources made much of several trials for impiety in which those close to him were involved, and this raises the question of religious tolerance in fifth-century Athens and, in particular, how far individuals enjoyed freedom of thought when faced with the civic community.<ref>Vincent Azoulay, 2014. ''Pericles of Athens'', trans. Janet Lloyd. Princeton and Oxford, 108.</ref>\n\n=== Legacy ===\n[[File:Akropolis by Leo von Klenze.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Acropolis at Athens'' (1846) by [[Leo von Klenze]]]]\n\nPericles' most visible legacy can be found in the literary and artistic works of the Golden Age, much of which survive to this day. The Acropolis, though in ruins, still stands and is a symbol of modern Athens. Paparrigopoulos wrote that these masterpieces are \"sufficient to render the name of Greece immortal in our world\".<ref name=\"Pap\" />\n\nIn politics, Victor L. Ehrenberg argues that a basic element of Pericles' legacy is Athenian imperialism, which denies true democracy and freedom to the people of all but the ruling state.<ref name=\"Ehren332\">V. L.
