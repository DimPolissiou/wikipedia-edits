It was equipped with 12 [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman Avenger I]] torpedo bombers. Two months later the squadron embarked on the escort carrier {{HMS|Ravager|D70|6}} and was transferred to the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Before being assigned to {{HMS|Tracker|D24|6}} in January 1944, four [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Grumman Wildcat V]] fighters were added to 846 NAS. HMS ''Tracker'' was first assigned to convoys going to [[Gibraltar]], then to [[Murmansk]]. On the latter voyage, aircraft from 846 NAS attacked eight German [[U-boat]]s.\n\nHMS ''Tracker'' was damaged in June 1944 in a collision with the Canadian frigate HMCS ''Teme'' (K458) while forming part of the naval screen for the D-Day landings, and the squadron disembarked to [[RAF Limavady]] airfield, [[Northern Ireland]], joining 15 Group RAF Coastal Command. A month later 846 NAS was assigned to {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|6}}, mainly laying mines off [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Norway]] until September 1944.\n\nIn December a detachment was formed and transferred to {{HMS|Premier|D23|6}} for a few days. The remainder of 846 NAS operated from HMS ''Trumpeter'' or [[RNAS Hatston]] in [[Orkney]] up to May 1945. On 4 May 1945, twelve Avenger and four Wildcat aircraft of the squadron took part in [[Operation Judgement, Kilbotn]], the last air-raid of the war in Europe. The fighter flight was disbanded after the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of hostilities in Europe]].\n\n846 NAS was then assigned to the 4th Carrier Group and should deploy to the Far East aboard the fleet carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}}. However, a change of plans led to the squadron becoming a trials unit. It was renumbered 751 NAS and was disbanded at [[RNAS Machrihanish (HMS Landrail)|Machrihanish]], in September 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/Squadrons/846.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619122419/http://fleetairarmarchive.net/Squadrons/846.html |archive-date=19 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Borneo===\n846 NAS was reformed in 1962 as a Commando squadron equipped with the [[Westland Whirlwind (helicopter)|Westland Whirlwind HAS.7]]. It was deployed to [[Borneo]] aboard the commando carrier {{HMS|Albion|R07|6}} and flew in support of actions against [[guerrilla]]s during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]]. [[British Army]] units gave 846 NAS the nickname 'Junglies' in Borneo, which the squadron has kept until today.\n\n[[File:WessexHU5 846Sqn Norway1981.jpeg|thumb|A Wessex HU5 of 846 NAS, Norway, 1981.]]\n\nAfter returning for the Far East, 846 NAS was disbanded again, only to be reformed in 1968 at [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose]]. This time the squadron was equipped with the [[Westland Wessex|Westland Wessex HU.5]]. The squadron deployed aboard the dock-landing ship {{HMS|Fearless|L10|6}} and conducted cold weather trials in Norway. In May 1972, the squadron was relocated to [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]] as the Wessex Headquarters and Trials Squadron. In February 1979 the squadron was deployed aboard the commando carrier {{HMS|Bulwark|R08|6}}. In December of the same year 846 NAS started to convert to the [[Westland Sea King|Westland Sea King HC.4]].\n\n===Falklands War===\nIn April 1982, 846 NAS embarked aboard the carrier {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} as part of the Royal Navy task force in the [[Falklands War]]. During the war 846 NAS Sea King's flew over 2800 hours, completed 10,000 individual troop moves and transported more than 81,600 [[Tonne|t]] of freight.\n\nIn 1983, detachments were deployed aboard the carriers HMS ''Hermes'' and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}. Between November 1983 and March 1984, a detachment of three Sea Kings was deployed aboard HMS ''Fearless'' and {{ship|RFA|Reliant|A131|6}} to the coast of [[Lebanon]] supporting British troops involved in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and took part in the eventual withdrawal of British troops and the evacuation of civilians from [[Beirut]], airlifting 521 civilians on 10 March 1994.

In six weeks the squadron flew a total of 1200 hours in support of Allied ground forces.

It was equipped with 12 [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman Avenger I]] torpedo bombers. Two months later the squadron embarked on the escort carrier {{HMS|Ravager|D70|6}} and was transferred to the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Before being assigned to {{HMS|Tracker|D24|6}} in January 1944, four [[Grumman F4F Wildcat|Grumman Wildcat V]] fighters were added to 846 NAS. HMS ''Tracker'' was first assigned to convoys going to [[Gibraltar]], then to [[Murmansk]]. On the latter voyage, aircraft from 846 NAS attacked eight German [[U-boat]]s.\n\nHMS ''Tracker'' was damaged in June 1944 in a collision with the Canadian frigate HMCS ''Teme'' (K458) while forming part of the naval screen for the D-Day landings, and the squadron disembarked to [[RAF Limavady]] airfield, [[Northern Ireland]], joining 15 Group RAF Coastal Command. A month later 846 NAS was assigned to {{HMS|Trumpeter|D09|6}}, mainly laying mines off [[Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|Norway]] until September 1944.\n\nIn December a detachment was formed and transferred to {{HMS|Premier|D23|6}} for a few days. The remainder of 846 NAS operated from HMS ''Trumpeter'' or [[RNAS Hatston]] in [[Orkney]] up to May 1945. On 4 May 1945, twelve Avenger and four Wildcat aircraft of the squadron took part in [[Operation Judgement, Kilbotn]], the last air-raid of the war in Europe. The fighter flight was disbanded after the [[Victory in Europe Day|end of hostilities in Europe]].\n\n846 NAS was then assigned to the 4th Carrier Group and should deploy to the Far East aboard the fleet carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}}. However, a change of plans led to the squadron becoming a trials unit. It was renumbered 751 NAS and was disbanded at [[RNAS Machrihanish (HMS Landrail)|Machrihanish]], in September 1945.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fleetairarmarchive.net/Squadrons/846.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619122419/http://fleetairarmarchive.net/Squadrons/846.html |archive-date=19 June 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Borneo===\n846 NAS was reformed in 1962 as a Commando squadron equipped with the [[Westland Whirlwind (helicopter)|Westland Whirlwind HAS.7]]. It was deployed to [[Borneo]] aboard the commando carrier {{HMS|Albion|R07|6}} and flew in support of actions against [[guerrilla]]s during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation]]. [[British Army]] units gave 846 NAS the nickname 'Junglies' in Borneo, which the squadron has kept until today.\n\n[[File:WessexHU5 846Sqn Norway1981.jpeg|thumb|A Wessex HU5 of 846 NAS, Norway, 1981.]]\n\nAfter returning for the Far East, 846 NAS was disbanded again, only to be reformed in 1968 at [[RNAS Culdrose (HMS Seahawk)|RNAS Culdrose]]. This time the squadron was equipped with the [[Westland Wessex|Westland Wessex HU.5]]. The squadron deployed aboard the dock-landing ship {{HMS|Fearless|L10|6}} and conducted cold weather trials in Norway. In May 1972, the squadron was relocated to [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]] as the Wessex Headquarters and Trials Squadron. In February 1979 the squadron was deployed aboard the commando carrier {{HMS|Bulwark|R08|6}}. In December of the same year 846 NAS started to convert to the [[Westland Sea King|Westland Sea King HC.4]].\n\n===Falklands War===\nIn April 1982, 846 NAS embarked aboard the carrier {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}} as part of the Royal Navy task force in the [[Falklands War]]. During the war 846 NAS Sea King's flew over 2800 hours, completed 10,000 individual troop moves and transported more than 81,600 [[Tonne|t]] of freight.\n\nIn 1983, detachments were deployed aboard the carriers HMS ''Hermes'' and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}}. Between November 1983 and March 1984, a detachment of three Sea Kings was deployed aboard HMS ''Fearless'' and {{ship|RFA|Reliant|A131|6}} to the coast of [[Lebanon]] supporting British troops involved in peacekeeping operations in Lebanon during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] and took part in the eventual withdrawal of British troops and the evacuation of civilians from [[Beirut]], airlifting 521 civilians on 10 March 1994.

In 1991, OU went 9\u20133, finished the season ranked No. 16 in the nation by the Associated Press, and soundly defeated [[1991 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]] in the [[1991 Gator Bowl (December)|Gator Bowl]]. In the 1992 follow-up campaign, however, OU finished 5\u20134\u20132, unranked and did not earn an invitation to a post-season bowl. Further, OU dropped games to rivals Nebraska and Texas and tied Oklahoma State. The draw with the Cowboys marked the first time since 1976 OU did not beat OSU in the annual Bedlam game. Gibbs' Sooners rebounded with a 9\u20133 record, a No. 17 finish in the final Associated Press poll and a Sun Bowl victory in 1993.

His coaching experience was very limited, especially compared to Schnellenberger.

The 79&nbsp;points scored by OU was the most in the country for Week 1. In Week 2, the Sooners played a much tougher opponent in Miami. However, the results seemed to show a mismatch, as OU easily defeated the Hurricanes 51\u201313. In Week 3, the Sooners got the best of [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]] with a 54\u20133 thrashing. Week 4 matched OU up with an in-state foe, [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]]. Just as it had been all season (except for the Sep 29 loss at unranked Colorado), the Sooners put up another dominant performance with a 62\u201321 victory. In Week 5 (September 29, 2007), the #4 Sooners saw their National Championship hopes take a hit as they lost to 2\u20132 unranked Colorado in Boulder 27\u201324 after leading in the second half by a score of 24\u20137. The Sooners only had 234 net yards compared to Colorado's 379 net yards. The 2007 match-up between Oklahoma and Texas on Oct. 2007 was predicted to be the #3&nbsp;game to watch in 2007 by SI.com's \"Top 20&nbsp;Games To Watch In 2007\" list. The Oklahoma football team proved itself worthy of the top ten rankings when it defeated Texas 28\u201321 at the Red River Rivalry. The Texas Longhorns played up to their potential when they answered almost every point during the October 6&nbsp;game. In the end [[Colt McCoy]] along with [[Jermichael Finley]] and the Longhorns could not withstand the adamant pressing of [[Sam Bradford]], [[DeMarco Murray]] and the Sooners.<ref>{{cite web | title = Top 20 Games To Watch In 2007 | work = SI.com | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0708/top.cfb.games.watch/content.18.html | accessdate =  September 30, 2007 }}</ref>  Oklahoma would go on to lose to an unranked Texas Tech team in an upset, although this was not enough to keep them from the Big 12 championship.

Opening with back to back home victories against Chattanooga and Cincinnati and scoring over 50&nbsp;points against both opponents would vault Oklahoma to number two in both polls, coupled with, then number three, Ohio State's loss and a lackluster victory by, then number two, Georgia over South Carolina. A road victory at Washington where the Sooners again scored more than 50&nbsp;points, a home victory over then undefeated and 24th ranked Texas Christian University, and a road win at Baylor resulted in Oklahoma being ranked number one in both polls after then-ranked number one USC tumbled after a defeat at Oregon State. The Sooners had defeated each of their first five opponents by 25&nbsp;points or more before facing then-number five Texas. In a see-saw battle where Oklahoma would take their last lead at 35\u201330, Texas would come from behind with 15 unanswered points to upset the Sooners at a neutral field by a final score of 45\u201335. The Sooners could muster up only 48 rushing yards while giving up 161. Also of note, the Sooners failed to convert on three fourth down attempts and Bradford threw two interceptions. Oklahoma would fall to number four in the AP Poll and number six in the USA Today Poll, while the Longhorns would be the new number one team in both polls. The game would result in controversy later in the season. Oklahoma would rebound by defeating then-ranked #16 Kansas at home and a road win at Kansas State. By the Week 8 rankings, Oklahoma would be ranked fourth in the AP Poll, fifth in the USA Today Coaches' Poll, and debut at fourth in the BCS behind undefeated Texas, [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]], and [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]]. The Sooners would then go on to defeat their next three opponents by more than 30&nbsp;points each, scoring 60 or more points. A home victory over Nebraska, a road win at Texas A&M and another home win over then-ranked #2 Texas Tech would result in some controversy. Along with an upset of Texas at the hands of Texas Tech and a previous loss by Penn State against [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]], Oklahoma was ranked 3 in the Associated Press Poll and number 2 in the USA Today Coaches' Poll ahead of Texas. However, Texas would be number two in the BCS followed by Oklahoma at number three. Alabama would hold number one in all polls with an undefeated record. Closing out the season with a win against Oklahoma State and Alabama's loss to Florida would leave the Sooners at number two in the Associated Press poll, and number one in both the USA Today Coaches' Poll and the BCS. The result of the three-way tie between Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas Tech in the Big 12 South standings, where each team suffered one loss at the hands of the other, would be the cause for many fans, particularly Texas fans, to cry foul. The Big 12 tie-breaker in this scenario was for the team with the highest BCS ranking to go on to play for the Big 12 Title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recap?gid=200812060024 |title=2008 Big 12 Championship |publisher=RivalsYahoo.com |accessdate=December 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109032857/http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recap?gid=200812060024 |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}</ref> Beating 19th ranked Missouri in Kansas City assured Oklahoma of a number one ranking in both the USA Today Coaches' Poll and the BCS, despite a number two ranking in the Associated Press Poll.

The Sooners would capture the 2015 Big 12 Conference Title. Oklahoma earned the fourth and final spot in the College Football Playoff, as Mayfield would finish fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. The stage was set for a rematch against [[2015 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] in the [[2015 Orange Bowl]]. They would lose, once again, to Clemson by a score of 37-17, even though they led at halftime 17-16. Shepard would leave for the [[2016 NFL Draft]].\n\nThe 2016 season was a continuation of the success the Sooners had the year before. Mayfield was granted the season of eligibility that he had lost due to Big 12 Conference transfer restrictions, and [[Dede Westbrook]] and the controversial, oft-suspended [[Joe Mixon]] had breakthrough years. The Sooners wouldn't be able to make the College Football Playoff this time around, as they lost 2 of their first 3 games (Week 1 vs. [[2016 Houston Cougars football team|Houston]] and Week 3 vs. [[2016 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]]). They still enjoyed a successful season - defeating [[2016 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]] 38\u201320 to win their second Big 12 Conference Title in a row, and having two Heisman Trophy finalists (Mayfield and Westbrook). They would go on to defeat the [[2016 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] in the [[2017 Sugar Bowl]], 35-19.

When Keys was enrolled in the university, he took Mex with him to Norman. With his experience as an army medic, Keys landed a job with the football team and a residence at the [[Kappa Sigma]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] house.<ref name=\"OUFBEnc\" /> Mex's main duty during games was to keep stray dogs from roaming the field. He wore a red sweater with a big \"O\" letter on the side. Mex received national attention in October 1924 when the Oklahoma football team lost a game against [[Drake University]]. Mex was lost when the team boarded a train in [[Arkansas City, Kansas]]. The media blamed the loss on the field on the loss of their mascot.<ref name=\"SS_SS&M\">{{cite web|title=Sooner Schooner & Mascots |work=SoonerSports.com |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma]] |url=http://www.soonersports.com/trads/schooner-mascots.html |accessdate=August 21, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811162821/http://www.soonersports.com/trads/schooner-mascots.html |archivedate=August 11, 2007 }}</ref> Mex was found later by two Oklahoma graduates.

The official Alma Mater song is the \"[[OU Chant]]\", which is sung by OU fans before sporting events and at ceremonial occasions.  Other tunes frequently heard at OU football games include the state song \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" and an alternate fight song titled \"Fight for OKU.\"\n\n[[The Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band]] is a nationally renowned ensemble founded in 1904.

In 1991, OU went 9\u20133, finished the season ranked No. 16 in the nation by the Associated Press, and soundly defeated [[1991 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Virginia]] in the [[1991 Gator Bowl (December)|Gator Bowl]]. In the 1992 follow-up campaign, however, OU finished 5\u20134\u20132, unranked and did not earn an invitation to a post-season bowl. Further, OU dropped games to rivals Nebraska and Texas and tied Oklahoma State. The draw with the Cowboys marked the first time since 1976 OU did not beat OSU in the annual Bedlam game. Gibbs' Sooners rebounded with a 9\u20133 record, a No. 17 finish in the final Associated Press poll and a Sun Bowl victory in 1993.

His coaching experience was very limited, especially compared to Schnellenberger.

The 79&nbsp;points scored by OU was the most in the country for Week 1. In Week 2, the Sooners played a much tougher opponent in Miami. However, the results seemed to show a mismatch, as OU easily defeated the Hurricanes 51\u201313. In Week 3, the Sooners got the best of [[Utah State Aggies football|Utah State]] with a 54\u20133 thrashing. Week 4 matched OU up with an in-state foe, [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]]. Just as it had been all season (except for the Sep 29 loss at unranked Colorado), the Sooners put up another dominant performance with a 62\u201321 victory. In Week 5 (September 29, 2007), the #4 Sooners saw their National Championship hopes take a hit as they lost to 2\u20132 unranked Colorado in Boulder 27\u201324 after leading in the second half by a score of 24\u20137. The Sooners only had 234 net yards compared to Colorado's 379 net yards. The 2007 match-up between Oklahoma and Texas on Oct. 2007 was predicted to be the #3&nbsp;game to watch in 2007 by SI.com's \"Top 20&nbsp;Games To Watch In 2007\" list. The Oklahoma football team proved itself worthy of the top ten rankings when it defeated Texas 28\u201321 at the Red River Rivalry. The Texas Longhorns played up to their potential when they answered almost every point during the October 6&nbsp;game. In the end [[Colt McCoy]] along with [[Jermichael Finley]] and the Longhorns could not withstand the adamant pressing of [[Sam Bradford]], [[DeMarco Murray]] and the Sooners.<ref>{{cite web | title = Top 20 Games To Watch In 2007 | work = SI.com | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0708/top.cfb.games.watch/content.18.html | accessdate =  September 30, 2007 }}</ref>  Oklahoma would go on to lose to an unranked Texas Tech team in an upset, although this was not enough to keep them from the Big 12 championship.

Opening with back to back home victories against Chattanooga and Cincinnati and scoring over 50&nbsp;points against both opponents would vault Oklahoma to number two in both polls, coupled with, then number three, Ohio State's loss and a lackluster victory by, then number two, Georgia over South Carolina. A road victory at Washington where the Sooners again scored more than 50&nbsp;points, a home victory over then undefeated and 24th ranked Texas Christian University, and a road win at Baylor resulted in Oklahoma being ranked number one in both polls after then-ranked number one USC tumbled after a defeat at Oregon State. The Sooners had defeated each of their first five opponents by 25&nbsp;points or more before facing then-number five Texas. In a see-saw battle where Oklahoma would take their last lead at 35\u201330, Texas would come from behind with 15 unanswered points to upset the Sooners at a neutral field by a final score of 45\u201335. The Sooners could muster up only 48 rushing yards while giving up 161. Also of note, the Sooners failed to convert on three fourth down attempts and Bradford threw two interceptions. Oklahoma would fall to number four in the AP Poll and number six in the USA Today Poll, while the Longhorns would be the new number one team in both polls. The game would result in controversy later in the season. Oklahoma would rebound by defeating then-ranked #16 Kansas at home and a road win at Kansas State. By the Week 8 rankings, Oklahoma would be ranked fourth in the AP Poll, fifth in the USA Today Coaches' Poll, and debut at fourth in the BCS behind undefeated Texas, [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]], and [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]]. The Sooners would then go on to defeat their next three opponents by more than 30&nbsp;points each, scoring 60 or more points. A home victory over Nebraska, a road win at Texas A&M and another home win over then-ranked #2 Texas Tech would result in some controversy. Along with an upset of Texas at the hands of Texas Tech and a previous loss by Penn State against [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa]], Oklahoma was ranked 3 in the Associated Press Poll and number 2 in the USA Today Coaches' Poll ahead of Texas. However, Texas would be number two in the BCS followed by Oklahoma at number three. Alabama would hold number one in all polls with an undefeated record. Closing out the season with a win against Oklahoma State and Alabama's loss to Florida would leave the Sooners at number two in the Associated Press poll, and number one in both the USA Today Coaches' Poll and the BCS. The result of the three-way tie between Oklahoma, Texas, and Texas Tech in the Big 12 South standings, where each team suffered one loss at the hands of the other, would be the cause for many fans, particularly Texas fans, to cry foul. The Big 12 tie-breaker in this scenario was for the team with the highest BCS ranking to go on to play for the Big 12 Title.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recap?gid=200812060024 |title=2008 Big 12 Championship |publisher=RivalsYahoo.com |accessdate=December 29, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109032857/http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recap?gid=200812060024 |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}</ref> Beating 19th ranked Missouri in Kansas City assured Oklahoma of a number one ranking in both the USA Today Coaches' Poll and the BCS, despite a number two ranking in the Associated Press Poll.

The Sooners would capture the 2015 Big 12 Conference Title. Oklahoma earned the fourth and final spot in the College Football Playoff, as Mayfield would finish fourth in Heisman Trophy voting. The stage was set for a rematch against [[2015 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]] in the [[2015 Orange Bowl]]. They would lose, once again, to Clemson by a score of 37-17, even though they led at halftime 17-16. Shepard would leave for the [[2016 NFL Draft]].\n\nThe 2016 season was a continuation of the success the Sooners had the year before. Mayfield was granted the season of eligibility that he had lost due to Big 12 Conference transfer restrictions, and [[Dede Westbrook]] and the controversial, oft-suspended [[Joe Mixon]] had breakthrough years. The Sooners wouldn't be able to make the College Football Playoff this time around, as they lost 2 of their first 3 games (Week 1 vs. [[2016 Houston Cougars football team|Houston]] and Week 3 vs. [[2016 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]]). They still enjoyed a successful season - defeating [[2016 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team|Oklahoma State]] 38\u201320 to win their second Big 12 Conference Title in a row, and having two Heisman Trophy finalists (Mayfield and Westbrook). They would go on to defeat the [[2016 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn Tigers]] in the [[2017 Sugar Bowl]], 35-19.

When Keys was enrolled in the university, he took Mex with him to Norman. With his experience as an army medic, Keys landed a job with the football team and a residence at the [[Kappa Sigma]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] house.<ref name=\"OUFBEnc\" /> Mex's main duty during games was to keep stray dogs from roaming the field. He wore a red sweater with a big \"O\" letter on the side. Mex received national attention in October 1924 when the Oklahoma football team lost a game against [[Drake University]]. Mex was lost when the team boarded a train in [[Arkansas City, Kansas]]. The media blamed the loss on the field on the loss of their mascot.<ref name=\"SS_SS&M\">{{cite web|title=Sooner Schooner & Mascots |work=SoonerSports.com |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma]] |url=http://www.soonersports.com/trads/schooner-mascots.html |accessdate=August 21, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811162821/http://www.soonersports.com/trads/schooner-mascots.html |archivedate=August 11, 2007 }}</ref> Mex was found later by two Oklahoma graduates.

The official Alma Mater song is the \"[[OU Chant]]\", which is sung by OU fans before sporting events and at ceremonial occasions.  Other tunes frequently heard at OU football games include the state song \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" and an alternate fight song titled \"Fight for OKU.\"\n\n[[The Pride of Oklahoma Marching Band]] is a nationally renowned ensemble founded in 1904.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

''Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition'' (p. 160)</ref> The event is traditionally characterized by having [[Survivor Series match]]es, which are [[tag team elimination match]]es that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. In July, the [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] returned, again splitting the roster between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands. Subsequently, the 2016 event, which was the thirtieth event in the Survivor Series chronology, featured several interpromotional matches to determine which was the better brand. \n\nOn the October 11 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', SmackDown's Commissioner [[Shane McMahon]] and General Manager [[Daniel Bryan]] challenged Raw to three traditional Survivor Series elimination matches, involving each brand's best five male wrestlers, best five female wrestlers, and best five tag teams, respectively\u2014with the latter having a total of 10 wrestlers per team, but with the stipulation being that if one member of a tag team was eliminated, both members of that particular tag team were eliminated (this was the first Survivor Series since the [[Survivor Series (1988)|1988 event]] to have teams of five tag teams going against each other).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clapp|first1=John|title=SmackDown LIVE issues huge Survivor Series challenge to Raw|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2016/article/smackdown-live-issues-survivor-series-challenge-to-raw|publisher=WWE|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown10112016\">{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Greg|title=10/11 WWE Smackdown LIVE \u2013 Parks's Complete, Real-Time Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/10/11/1011-wwe-smackdown-live-parkss-ongoing-real-time-report/|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref> The following week on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', Raw Commissioner [[Stephanie McMahon]] accepted the challenge to determine the better brand; this would be the genesis for the theme of the following years' events.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clapp|first1=John|title=Raw accepts SmackDown LIVE's Survivor Series challenge|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2016/article/raw-accepts-smackdown-live-survivor-series-challenge|work=WWE|accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown10182016\">{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Greg|title=10/18 WWE Smackdown LIVE \u2013 Parks's Ongoing, Real-Time Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/10/18/1018-wwe-smackdown-live-parkss-ongoing-real-time-report-2/|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=October 18, 2016|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Storylines ===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD WEEK-BY-WEEK EVENTS, RUMORS OR SPECULATION.

Perkins|TJ Perkins]], [[Rich Swann]] and [[Noam Dar]] defeated [[Tony Nese]], [[Drew Gulak]] and [[Ariya Daivari]] when Swann executed a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Standing|standing]] [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#450\u00b0 splash|450\u00b0 splash]] on Daivari for a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]].<ref name=\"preSSeries2016\"/>\n\nLater, [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] defeated [[Luke Harper]] after a [[chokeslam]].<ref name=\"preSSeries2016\"/>\n\n=== Preliminary matches ===\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the women's Survivor Series match pitting Team Raw (Raw Women's Champion Charlotte, Bayley, Sasha Banks, Alicia Fox, and Nia Jax) against Team SmackDown (Nikki Bella, Carmella, Naomi, Alexa Bliss, and SmackDown Women's Champion Becky Lynch) in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series Elimination Match. Immediately before the match, SmackDown's captain Nikki Bella was attacked backstage, leaving her unable to compete, and team coach Natalya replaced her. Alicia [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] Carmella after a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Scissors kick|scissors kick]] but was herself pinned by Alexa Bliss after \"[[Moonsault#Rounding moonsault|Twisted Bliss]]\". Naomi was [[Professional wrestling#Countout|counted out]] after Nia Jax attacked her. Natalya pinned Sasha with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll-up]] but was pinned by Charlotte after a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|Queen's Boot]]\". Becky Lynch forced Nia Jax [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]] to the \"[[Professional wrestling holds#Seated fujiwara armbar|Dis-arm-her]]\", eliminating Jax. Charlotte pinned Alexa after a \"Queen's Boot\". Bayley pinned Lynch after a \"[[Suplex#Belly-to-belly suplex|Bayley-to-Belly Suplex]]\", leaving Bayley and Charlotte as the survivors for Team Raw. After the match, Charlotte attacked Bayley.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nNext, The Miz defended the Intercontinental Championship against Sami Zayn. In the end, Zayn applied the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure-four leglock|Figure-four leglock]] on Miz; as Miz was about to submit, Miz's [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] Maryse rang the ring bell. Zayn released the hold, thinking he had won, but Miz pinned him with a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nAfter this, Team Raw (Raw Tag Team Champions The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston), Cesaro and Sheamus, Enzo Amore and Big Cass, The Shining Stars, and Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) faced Team SmackDown (SmackDown Tag Team Champions Heath Slater and Rhyno, The Hype Bros, American Alpha, Breezango, and The Usos) in the tag team's Survivor Series match. Breezango, in their new fashion police attire, began by handing out tickets to everyone but were quickly eliminated by The New Day after the \"Midnight Hour\" (a \"[[cutter (professional wrestling)#Over the shoulder cutter|Big Ending]]\" and [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Diving DDT|diving DDT]] combination) on [[Fandango (wrestler)|Fandango]]. Immediately after, [[The Usos|Jimmy Uso]] executed a [[superkick]] on Kingston for a pinfall to eliminate New Day. Gallows and Anderson performed a \"[[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided whiplash|Magic Killer]]\" on [[Zack Ryder]], eliminating The Hype Bros. American Alpha executed an [[Doomsday Device (wrestling)#Elevated diving bulldog|electric chair/diving bulldog combination]] on [[Primo (wrestler)|Primo]], eliminating The Shining Stars. Gallows and Anderson eliminated American Alpha with a \"Magic Killer\" on [[Jason Jordan]], but were eliminated by Rhyno and Heath Slater after Rhyno performed a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#striking spear|Gore]]\" on Gallows. [[Enzo Amore]] [[Enzo and Cass|and]] [[Big Cass]] then performed a \"[[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Rocket Launcher|Bada Boom Shakalaka]]\" on Rhyno, eliminating him and Heath Slater. The Usos eliminated Enzo and Cass after a \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|Samoan Splash]]\" on Enzo. In the end, Cesaro applied the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] on [[The Usos|Jey Uso]] while Sheamus performed a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#Bicycle kick|Brogue Kick]]\" on Jimmy. Jey submitted, leaving Cesaro and Sheamus as the sole survivors for Team Raw.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, The Brian Kendrick defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto. Kendrick won by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] after Baron Corbin attacked Kendrick and then Kalisto, meaning Kendrick retained the title and the cruiserweight division remained on Raw. Backstage, Daniel Bryan confronted Corbin, who explained that he acted out of revenge on Kalisto to prevent more cruiserweights from appearing on SmackDown.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nThe next match was the men's Survivor Series elimination match pitting Team Raw (WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens, Chris Jericho, Braun Strowman, United States Champion Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins) against Team SmackDown (WWE World Champion AJ Styles, Dean Ambrose, Bray Wyatt, Randy Orton, and Shane McMahon), who were accompanied by their mascot, James Ellsworth. Early in the match, Ambrose and Styles got into a heated argument. Ambrose attacked Styles, but was surprised by Strowman, who scored a pinfall after a [[Powerslam#front powerslam|running powerslam]]; Styles did not attempt to break the pin. Afterwards outside the ring, Orton executed an \"[[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]]\" on Strowman onto a broadcast table. McMahon put Strowman through the table with a \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|Leap of Faith]]\". Strowman was counted out when Ellsworth, who hid under the ring, held Strowman's legs to prevent him from returning to the ring. Strowman then chased Ellsworth up the entrance ramp and threw him off the stage. Later, Styles attempted the \"[[Facebuster#Belly-to-back inverted mat slam|Styles Clash]]\" on Jericho but Owens attacked Styles with the \"[[Chris Jericho#Alliance and feud with Kevin Owens (2016\u2013present)|List of Jericho]]\" and was disqualified. Jericho was distraught by his list being ripped apart. This allowed Orton to pin him after an \"RKO\". McMahon then attempted a \"[[Dropkick#Corner-to-corner missile dropkick|Coast to Coast]]\" but Reigns caught him mid-air with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]]. The referee ruled the apparently unconscious Shane unfit to continue, eliminating him from the match. Ambrose, who had already been eliminated, returned to attack Styles and helped his former [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|Shield]] bretheren Rollins and Reigns perform a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided powerbomb|triple powerbomb]] on Styles through a broadcast table. Rollins rolled Styles back in the ring for the pinfall. As Rollins attempted a Frog Splash on Wyatt, Orton quickly performed an \"RKO\" on Rollins, allowing Wyatt to score a pinfall. Reigns, Team Raw's final member, attempted a spear on Wyatt but hit Orton instead, who had pushed Wyatt out of the way. Wyatt then performed \"[[Facebuster#Swinging reverse STO|Sister Abigail]]\" on Reigns for the pin, leaving Wyatt and Orton as the survivors for Team SmackDown.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\n=== Main event ===\nIn the main event, Goldberg faced Brock Lesnar. Lesnar tackled Goldberg into the corner, only for Goldberg to shove Lesnar to the mat. As Lesnar stood up, Goldberg hit him with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]]. Goldberg then executed another spear and a \"[[Powerslam#Vertical suplex powerslam|Jackhammer]]\" on Lesnar to win the match.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n<!-- DO NOT ADD WEEK-BY-WEEK EVENTS, RUMORS OR SPECULATION.

However, The New Day retained their championship.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/>\n\nOn the ''Highlight Reel'' during ''Raw'', Chris Jericho got into a heated argument with his best friend Kevin Owens. Jericho blamed Owens for using \"The List of Jericho\" as a weapon, whereas Owens explained that he tried to save Jericho from being eliminated. The two finally agreed that Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins were at fault for Team Raw's loss. Rollins then demanded a title shot for Owens's WWE Universal Championship, as he was guaranteed a match for being part of Team Raw. Mick Foley then scheduled Owens to defend the title in the main event against Rollins in a no disqualification match, with Reigns and Jericho banned from ringside. The match ended when Jericho, disguised as a masked fan, interfered, allowing Owens to capitalize and retain the championship.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/> The following week, the friendship between Owens and Jericho was strained further, when Owens stated he did not need Jericho's help against the challenge of Roman Reigns. Reigns then defeated Owens to earn a title match for the Universal Championship at [[Roadblock: End of the Line|Roadblock]].<ref name=\"Raw11282016\"/>\n\nAlso on ''Raw'', Charlotte justified her attack on Bayley, stating she no longer had to be her teammate after the match. She was then confronted by Sasha Banks, who invoked her championship rematch clause. Charlotte agreed, but insisted that the match would take place the following week, in her own hometown.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/> The next week, Sasha defeated Charlotte in a falls-count-anywhere match for her third Raw Women's Championship.<ref name=\"Raw11282016\"/>\n\nRich Swann defeated TJ Perkins and Noam Dar in a triple threat match to become the number one contender for the Cruiserweight Championship.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/> On the premiere of the cruiserweight's new exclusive show, ''[[WWE 205 Live|205 Live]]'', Swann defeated Kendrick for the championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/11/30/1129-wwe-205-live-review-2nd-report-premiere-episode-including-kendrick-vs-rich-swann-title-gallagher-vs-daivari-gulak-nese-vs-bollywood/|title=11/29 WWE \"205 Live\" Review (2nd Report): Premiere episode including Kendrick vs. Rich Swann for title, Gallagher vs. Daivari, Gulak & Nese vs. Bollywood|date=November 29, 2016|last=DeAngelo|first=Dominic|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== SmackDown === \nThe following ''SmackDown'', Shane McMahon granted James Ellsworth a SmackDown contract for his dedication to the SmackDown brand. AJ Styles criticized this decision, arguing that Ellsworth should earn his contract in a ladder match. Ellsworth accepted the challenge, with both his new contract and a future opportunity at the WWE World Championship on the line. Dean Ambrose, who had been repeatedly sent out of the arena, returned during the match and helped Ellsworth defeat Styles.<ref name=\"Smackdown11222016\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/11/22/kellers-wwe-smackdown-report-1122-full-coverage-fallout-survivor-series-shane-speech-miz-vs-kalisto-styles-vs-ellsworth-ladder-match/|title=KELLER\u2019S WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT 11/22: Full coverage of fallout from Survivor Series, Shane speech, Miz vs. Kalisto, Styles vs. Ellsworth ladder match|date=November 22, 2016|last=Keller|first=Wade|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Miz confronted Daniel Bryan about retaining the Intercontinental Championship and gloated over Kalisto not winning his match. Bryan responded that the way Miz won his match humiliated SmackDown and then scheduled Miz to immediately defend the title against Kalisto. Miz won the match when Corbin distracted Kalisto. After the match, Corbin attacked Kalisto with the ''End of Days'', while Miz's celebration was cut short by Dolph Ziggler with a Superkick. Bryan later scheduled The Miz to defend the Intercontinental Championship against Ziggler at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2016)|TLC]] in a [[ladder match]].<ref name=\"Smackdown11222016\"/> As punishment for costing Kalisto two title opportunities and SmackDown the cruiserwight division, Bryan put Baron Corbin in a match against Kane.

Becky won the match but was attacked afterwards by Alexa.<ref name=\"Smackdown11222016\"/> The following week, during the contract signing, Becky attacked Alexa but was eventually put through a table by Alexa. The match between the two was made a [[Professional wrestling match types#Tables match|tables match]].<ref name=\"Smackdown11292016\"/> Also backstage, Nikki Bella accused Carmella of being the one that attacked her at Survivor Series, which Carmella denied.

The second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's [[WrestleMania]]), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, [[Royal Rumble]], and [[SummerSlam]], dubbed the \"Big Four\".<ref>Ian Hamilton. ''Wrestling's Sinking Ship: What Happens to an Industry Without Competition'' (p. 160)</ref> The event is traditionally characterized by having [[Survivor Series match]]es, which are [[tag team elimination match]]es that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. In July, the [[WWE brand extension|brand extension]] returned, again splitting the roster between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands. Subsequently, the 2016 event, which was the thirtieth event in the Survivor Series chronology, featured several interpromotional matches to determine which was the better brand. \n\nOn the October 11 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', SmackDown's Commissioner [[Shane McMahon]] and General Manager [[Daniel Bryan]] challenged Raw to three traditional Survivor Series elimination matches, involving each brand's best five male wrestlers, best five female wrestlers, and best five tag teams, respectively\u2014with the latter having a total of 10 wrestlers per team, but with the stipulation being that if one member of a tag team was eliminated, both members of that particular tag team were eliminated (this was the first Survivor Series since the [[Survivor Series (1988)|1988 event]] to have teams of five tag teams going against each other).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clapp|first1=John|title=SmackDown LIVE issues huge Survivor Series challenge to Raw|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2016/article/smackdown-live-issues-survivor-series-challenge-to-raw|publisher=WWE|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown10112016\">{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Greg|title=10/11 WWE Smackdown LIVE \u2013 Parks's Complete, Real-Time Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/10/11/1011-wwe-smackdown-live-parkss-ongoing-real-time-report/|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=October 11, 2016|accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref> The following week on ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'', Raw Commissioner [[Stephanie McMahon]] accepted the challenge to determine the better brand; this would be the genesis for the theme of the following years' events.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Clapp|first1=John|title=Raw accepts SmackDown LIVE's Survivor Series challenge|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2016/article/raw-accepts-smackdown-live-survivor-series-challenge|work=WWE|accessdate=October 17, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Smackdown10182016\">{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Greg|title=10/18 WWE Smackdown LIVE \u2013 Parks's Ongoing, Real-Time Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/10/18/1018-wwe-smackdown-live-parkss-ongoing-real-time-report-2/|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=October 18, 2016|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Storylines ===\n<!-- DO NOT ADD WEEK-BY-WEEK EVENTS, RUMORS OR SPECULATION.

Goldberg, who originally had no intention of ever returning to WWE, began a working relationship with the promotion again in January 2016, thanks to [[2K Sports]], who publishes the ''[[WWE 2K]]'' video games. On the May 30 episode of ''Raw'', Goldberg was revealed as the pre-order bonus for the ''[[WWE 2K17]]'' video game, which featured Lesnar on the cover. During the [[SummerSlam (2016)|2016 SummerSlam]] weekend at the ''WWE 2K'' event in Germany, Goldberg jokingly challenged Lesnar to a match. Lesnar and Goldberg continually traded barbs and insults against each other on social media and at ''WWE 2K17'' press events. On October 5, Goldberg appeared on [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]]'' with [[Jonathan Coachman]] to promote his appearance in ''WWE 2K17''. He teased a possible return to WWE, and stated that he would want to face Lesnar if he were to return because he owed Lesnar a rematch.

Zayn defeated Rusev, earning the title match.<ref name=\"Raw11072016\"/> However, his opponent changed when The Miz regained the title from Ziggler, albeit with help from [[Maryse Ouellet|Maryse]], on ''SmackDown''{{'}}s 900th episode on November 15.<ref name=\"Smackdown11152016\"/>\n\nOn the November 8 episode of ''SmackDown'', Bryan revealed that since SmackDown's Intercontinental Championship would be defended against a wrestler from Raw, Foley allowed Raw's [[WWE Cruiserweight Championship|WWE Cruiserweight Champion]] [[Brian Kendrick|The Brian Kendrick]] to defend the title against a SmackDown wrestler. Bryan chose [[Kalisto (wrestler)|Kalisto]] and revealed that if Kalisto would win the title, the entire [[Cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|cruiserweight division]] would come to SmackDown.<ref name=\"Smackdown11082016\"/> On the November 14 episode of ''Raw'', Kendrick addressed the cruiserweights, and assured them that he would defeat Kalisto and keep the division on Raw.

Immediately before the match, SmackDown's captain Nikki Bella was attacked backstage, leaving her unable to compete, and team coach Natalya replaced her. Alicia [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] Carmella after a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Scissors kick|scissors kick]] but was herself pinned by Alexa Bliss after \"[[Moonsault#Rounding moonsault|Twisted Bliss]]\". Naomi was [[Professional wrestling#Countout|counted out]] after Nia Jax attacked her. Natalya pinned Sasha with a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Roll-up|roll-up]] but was pinned by Charlotte after a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#Big boot|Queen's Boot]]\". Becky Lynch forced Nia Jax [[Professional wrestling#Submission|submit]] to the \"[[Professional wrestling holds#Seated fujiwara armbar|Dis-arm-her]]\", eliminating Jax. Charlotte pinned Alexa after a \"Queen's Boot\". Bayley pinned Lynch after a \"[[Suplex#Belly-to-belly suplex|Bayley-to-Belly Suplex]]\", leaving Bayley and Charlotte as the survivors for Team Raw. After the match, Charlotte attacked Bayley.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nNext, The Miz defended the Intercontinental Championship against Sami Zayn. In the end, Zayn applied the [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure-four leglock|Figure-four leglock]] on Miz; as Miz was about to submit, Miz's [[Manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] Maryse rang the ring bell. Zayn released the hold, thinking he had won, but Miz pinned him with a roll-up to retain the title.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nAfter this, Team Raw (Raw Tag Team Champions The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston), Cesaro and Sheamus, Enzo Amore and Big Cass, The Shining Stars, and Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) faced Team SmackDown (SmackDown Tag Team Champions Heath Slater and Rhyno, The Hype Bros, American Alpha, Breezango, and The Usos) in the tag team's Survivor Series match. Breezango, in their new fashion police attire, began by handing out tickets to everyone but were quickly eliminated by The New Day after the \"Midnight Hour\" (a \"[[cutter (professional wrestling)#Over the shoulder cutter|Big Ending]]\" and [[DDT (professional wrestling)#Diving DDT|diving DDT]] combination) on [[Fandango (wrestler)|Fandango]]. Immediately after, [[The Usos|Jimmy Uso]] executed a [[superkick]] on Kingston for a pinfall to eliminate New Day. Gallows and Anderson performed a \"[[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided whiplash|Magic Killer]]\" on [[Zack Ryder]], eliminating The Hype Bros. American Alpha executed an [[Doomsday Device (wrestling)#Elevated diving bulldog|electric chair/diving bulldog combination]] on [[Primo (wrestler)|Primo]], eliminating The Shining Stars. Gallows and Anderson eliminated American Alpha with a \"Magic Killer\" on [[Jason Jordan]], but were eliminated by Rhyno and Heath Slater after Rhyno performed a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#striking spear|Gore]]\" on Gallows. [[Enzo Amore]] [[Enzo and Cass|and]] [[Big Cass]] then performed a \"[[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Rocket Launcher|Bada Boom Shakalaka]]\" on Rhyno, eliminating him and Heath Slater. The Usos eliminated Enzo and Cass after a \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|Samoan Splash]]\" on Enzo. In the end, Cesaro applied the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]] on [[The Usos|Jey Uso]] while Sheamus performed a \"[[Professional wrestling attacks#Bicycle kick|Brogue Kick]]\" on Jimmy. Jey submitted, leaving Cesaro and Sheamus as the sole survivors for Team Raw.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, The Brian Kendrick defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto. Kendrick won by [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] after Baron Corbin attacked Kendrick and then Kalisto, meaning Kendrick retained the title and the cruiserweight division remained on Raw. Backstage, Daniel Bryan confronted Corbin, who explained that he acted out of revenge on Kalisto to prevent more cruiserweights from appearing on SmackDown.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\nThe next match was the men's Survivor Series elimination match pitting Team Raw (WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens, Chris Jericho, Braun Strowman, United States Champion Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins) against Team SmackDown (WWE World Champion AJ Styles, Dean Ambrose, Bray Wyatt, Randy Orton, and Shane McMahon), who were accompanied by their mascot, James Ellsworth. Early in the match, Ambrose and Styles got into a heated argument. Ambrose attacked Styles, but was surprised by Strowman, who scored a pinfall after a [[Powerslam#front powerslam|running powerslam]]; Styles did not attempt to break the pin. Afterwards outside the ring, Orton executed an \"[[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|RKO]]\" on Strowman onto a broadcast table. McMahon put Strowman through the table with a \"[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving elbow drop|Leap of Faith]]\". Strowman was counted out when Ellsworth, who hid under the ring, held Strowman's legs to prevent him from returning to the ring. Strowman then chased Ellsworth up the entrance ramp and threw him off the stage. Later, Styles attempted the \"[[Facebuster#Belly-to-back inverted mat slam|Styles Clash]]\" on Jericho but Owens attacked Styles with the \"[[Chris Jericho#Alliance and feud with Kevin Owens (2016\u2013present)|List of Jericho]]\" and was disqualified. Jericho was distraught by his list being ripped apart. This allowed Orton to pin him after an \"RKO\". McMahon then attempted a \"[[Dropkick#Corner-to-corner missile dropkick|Coast to Coast]]\" but Reigns caught him mid-air with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]]. The referee ruled the apparently unconscious Shane unfit to continue, eliminating him from the match. Ambrose, who had already been eliminated, returned to attack Styles and helped his former [[The Shield (professional wrestling)|Shield]] bretheren Rollins and Reigns perform a [[Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers#Aided powerbomb|triple powerbomb]] on Styles through a broadcast table. Rollins rolled Styles back in the ring for the pinfall. As Rollins attempted a Frog Splash on Wyatt, Orton quickly performed an \"RKO\" on Rollins, allowing Wyatt to score a pinfall. Reigns, Team Raw's final member, attempted a spear on Wyatt but hit Orton instead, who had pushed Wyatt out of the way. Wyatt then performed \"[[Facebuster#Swinging reverse STO|Sister Abigail]]\" on Reigns for the pin, leaving Wyatt and Orton as the survivors for Team SmackDown.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\n=== Main event ===\nIn the main event, Goldberg faced Brock Lesnar. Lesnar tackled Goldberg into the corner, only for Goldberg to shove Lesnar to the mat. As Lesnar stood up, Goldberg hit him with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]]. Goldberg then executed another spear and a \"[[Powerslam#Vertical suplex powerslam|Jackhammer]]\" on Lesnar to win the match.<ref name=\"SSeries2016\"/>\n\n== Aftermath ==\n<!-- DO NOT ADD WEEK-BY-WEEK EVENTS, RUMORS OR SPECULATION.

However, The New Day retained their championship.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/>\n\nOn the ''Highlight Reel'' during ''Raw'', Chris Jericho got into a heated argument with his best friend Kevin Owens. Jericho blamed Owens for using \"The List of Jericho\" as a weapon, whereas Owens explained that he tried to save Jericho from being eliminated. The two finally agreed that Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins were at fault for Team Raw's loss. Rollins then demanded a title shot for Owens's WWE Universal Championship, as he was guaranteed a match for being part of Team Raw. Mick Foley then scheduled Owens to defend the title in the main event against Rollins in a no disqualification match, with Reigns and Jericho banned from ringside. The match ended when Jericho, disguised as a masked fan, interfered, allowing Owens to capitalize and retain the championship.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/> The following week, the friendship between Owens and Jericho was strained further, when Owens stated he did not need Jericho's help against the challenge of Roman Reigns. Reigns then defeated Owens to earn a title match for the Universal Championship at [[Roadblock: End of the Line|Roadblock]].<ref name=\"Raw11282016\"/>\n\nAlso on ''Raw'', Charlotte justified her attack on Bayley, stating she no longer had to be her teammate after the match.

Charlotte agreed, but insisted that the match would take place the following week, in her own hometown.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/> The next week, Sasha defeated Charlotte in a falls-count-anywhere match for her third Raw Women's Championship.<ref name=\"Raw11282016\"/>\n\nRich Swann defeated TJ Perkins and Noam Dar in a triple threat match to become the number one contender for the Cruiserweight Championship.<ref name=\"Raw11212016\"/> On the premiere of the cruiserweight's new exclusive show, ''[[WWE 205 Live|205 Live]]'', Swann defeated Kendrick for the championship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/11/30/1129-wwe-205-live-review-2nd-report-premiere-episode-including-kendrick-vs-rich-swann-title-gallagher-vs-daivari-gulak-nese-vs-bollywood/|title=11/29 WWE \"205 Live\" Review (2nd Report): Premiere episode including Kendrick vs. Rich Swann for title, Gallagher vs. Daivari, Gulak & Nese vs. Bollywood|date=November 29, 2016|last=DeAngelo|first=Dominic|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== SmackDown === \nThe following ''SmackDown'', Shane McMahon granted James Ellsworth a SmackDown contract for his dedication to the SmackDown brand. AJ Styles criticized this decision, arguing that Ellsworth should earn his contract in a ladder match. Ellsworth accepted the challenge, with both his new contract and a future opportunity at the WWE World Championship on the line. Dean Ambrose, who had been repeatedly sent out of the arena, returned during the match and helped Ellsworth defeat Styles.<ref name=\"Smackdown11222016\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/11/22/kellers-wwe-smackdown-report-1122-full-coverage-fallout-survivor-series-shane-speech-miz-vs-kalisto-styles-vs-ellsworth-ladder-match/|title=KELLER\u2019S WWE SMACKDOWN REPORT 11/22: Full coverage of fallout from Survivor Series, Shane speech, Miz vs. Kalisto, Styles vs. Ellsworth ladder match|date=November 22, 2016|last=Keller|first=Wade|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|accessdate=November 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Miz confronted Daniel Bryan about retaining the Intercontinental Championship and gloated over Kalisto not winning his match. Bryan responded that the way Miz won his match humiliated SmackDown and then scheduled Miz to immediately defend the title against Kalisto. Miz won the match when Corbin distracted Kalisto. After the match, Corbin attacked Kalisto with the ''End of Days'', while Miz's celebration was cut short by Dolph Ziggler with a Superkick. Bryan later scheduled The Miz to defend the Intercontinental Championship against Ziggler at [[TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs (2016)|TLC]] in a [[ladder match]].<ref name=\"Smackdown11222016\"/> As punishment for costing Kalisto two title opportunities and SmackDown the cruiserwight division, Bryan put Baron Corbin in a match against Kane.

The surrounding ten rock faces have a small number of engravings as well. The rocks consist of [[shale]] and [[hornfels]] oriented toward the north and they shine for a while at sunset. As an overhanging cliff they are in the structure of a rock shelter.\n\n==Description==\nThree hundred and four representations can be seen, of which 166 figures are animals and 108 are unidentified motifs. Representations of [[cetacea]]ns are the most frequent, being 14.4% of the figures. In terms of theme, the representations are either anthropomorphic, depicting the body or face of a human; zoomorphic, showing sea and land animals; hunting and fishing tools; and indeterminate markings whose themes or shapes are hard to identify.\n\nThe engravings of whales and deer were made in most cases by carving out the body, while those of land animals mostly consist of outlines and patterns drawn on the rock surface. Such difference suggest difference in the time of production, given the overlapping relationships of the depictions. At the site, cetaceans are most important, followed by deer and land animals in that order, and there are a small number of turtles, seals, fish, and birds.\n\n===Human figures===\nThe figures are side views of the whole body with a somewhat exaggerated penis or front images of people with mask-like faces spreading their four limbs. There are engravings of people hunting animals with a bow, raising their hands, and playing a long rod like a musical instrument, recalling hunting and religious acts.\n\n===Animal figures===\nShapes and features enable the species to be discriminated. Most of them are whales and concentrated on the left main rock face. [[Ungulate]] mammals like deer and predatory animals like tigers, leopard, and wolves are mainly on the right main rock face. Animals whose species can be identified include large cetaceans such as the [[northern right whale]], the [[humpback whale]], the [[right whale]], the [[gray whale]], and the [[sperm whale]]. There are also sea animals such as sea turtles, seal, salmon-like fish; sea birds; and land animals such as [[red deer]], [[musk deer]], [[roe deer]], [[water deer]], tigers, leopards, wolves, foxes, [[raccoon dog]]s, and [[wild boar]]s.\n\n====Sea animals====\nWhale engravings are in general 20 to 30&nbsp;cm long and between 10 and 80&nbsp;cm high. Most show whales swimming in a group upward as if seen from a bird's-eye view. Sideway engravings of whales are made in a \"twisted method\" in which the tail is carved sideways to show the horizontal tail of the whale, which is different from fish. Other rock art shows a mother whale with her baby on her back, whale jumping scenes, and large cetaceans migrating to and from the remote sea, all vividly depicting whale behaviour. The whale horizontally overturning a boat with its body seems to be dead, and stripes carved on its body are thought to be distribution or breakup lines, resembling ethnographic material describing natives distributing pieces of whale. These engravings are assessed to provide important information about the hunting and subsequent distribution of large animals.\n\nThe three turtles on the upper left of the main rock face appear to be guiding whales swimming in a group. Since sea turtles come to the shore to spawn between early spring and summer, they are often regarded in ancient myth as symbolic animals crossing the boundary of sea and land. In the case of fish, heads of fish looking like sharks are depicted sideways, and there are salmon jumping above the sea surface. On later engravings there is the suggestion of a wooden fence, but since the inner outlines resemble fish and land animals are lacking the possibility of a fishpound has been considered.\n\n====Land animals====\nMost of the land animals are shown in a side view, which can best express the shape of four-limbed land animals. Some species can be classified according to the shape of body, skin patterns, the length of tail and legs, and the shoulder line. These include [[sika deer]], red deer, musk deer, roe deer, and water deer.\n\nSea birds are always placed around whales as they are hunting prey. Some engravings show mating and molt scenes of land animals and because of different patterns and angle of fall suggest the annual change of seasons and the breeding season.\n\n===Tools===\nTools  relating to hunting and fishing such as boats, floats, harpoons, fishing net, fish pounds, and bows provide information on the age of the rock art and livelihood of the time. This site also has scenes of whales and tigers being captured with a net. Although no prehistoric net has yet been excavated, fine marks of net on pottery discovered in the [[Dongsam-dong Shell Midden]] suggest that nets were widely used not only for fishing but also for hunting in those days.\n\nThe site has scenes showing whaling activities in great detail. Around 5\u201317 people are on boats surrounding whales. The bows and sterns are semi-circular and are connected to a harpoon stuck into the body of whales and to floats hanging on a rope. The tools are almost identical to those used by natives for whaling today.\n\n===Indeterminate figures===\nEngravings of uncertain theme and content have been classified into two types: those of unknown theme which are in good condition and those of unknown shape which have been worn and damaged over time and are therefore hard to decode. Some have signs with certain patterns, but it is hard to classify them on the basis of engravings on the rock alone. Signs are conceptual expressions that are impossible to find in real life but are repeated expressions of a certain pattern.\n\n==Dating==\nAccording to the results of an analysis of animal bones discovered in a shell midden in Ulsan and widespread along the southeastern coasts and of research on Ulsan Bay's archaeological environment, the site dates back to 7,000 to 3,500 years ago. Many relics related to the themes of the rock art were found at [[Neolithic]] sites, include deer pattern pottery, net pattern pottery and shell mask discovered in the Dongsam-dong Shell Midden in [[Busan]], a figure with human faces in Osan-ri in Yangyang, a small clay wild pig excavated from the shell midden on Yokjido island of [[Tongyeong]], the clay figure of a woman in Sinam-ri in Ulsan, and a small clay seal excavated from the shell midden in Sejuk-ri, Ulsan. Furthermore, a boat was excavated from the shell midden in Bibong-ri, Changnyeong, and during the Hwangseong-dong site excavation research project conducted by the Korea Archaeology and Art History Research Institute a whale bone stuck with a harpoon was found, which empirically proves whaling.\n\nThe layers which contain the bones of captured whales date back to 5500 to 4700 BP. Consequently, considering livelihoods in that period, hunting and fishing tools, related relics, and contemporary contents, the rock art seems to have been made between the early and mid-Neolithic era. Before the site was discovered, the first whaling was thought to have taken place between the 10th and 11th century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Lee|first1= Sang-Mog|last2= Robineau|first2= Daniel|date= January-March 2004|title= The cetaceans of the Neolithic rock carvings of Bangu-dae (South Korea) and the beginning of whaling in the North-West Pacific|url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003552104000020|journal= L'Anthropologie|volume= 108|issue= 1|pages= 137-151|doi= |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFrom the abundant representations of marine animals, the site seems to be in close relationship with hunter-fishers attributed to the Neolithic era (between 8000 BP and 3500 BP). Consequently, the Bangudae site has the most ancient evidence of whaling worldwide and is considered highly important not only as a first whaling representation, but also for understanding prehistoric maritime culture in the northern Pacific area.\n\n== Preservation concerns ==\nThe Sayeon Dam, built from 1962 to 1965 and expanded between 1999 and 2002, helps supply Ulsan with drinking water but has caused the rocks on which the petroglyphs are carved to be flooded for about eight months of every year. This periodic flooding raises concerns of erosion and water damage of the rock-art motifs, which are considered to be masterpieces of prehistoric art and an invaluable source of prehistoric information. The government of Korea is considering building a polycarbonate \u201cdam\u201d to protect the rock faces.\n\n[[File:Bangudae2.jpg|thumb|Banguda scene, source: Ulsan Petroglyph Museum]]\n[[File:Bangudae3.jpg|thumb|Bangudae rock images, source: Ulsan Petroglyph Museum]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Prehistoric Korea]]\n* [[Jeulmun pottery period]]\n* [[Mumun pottery period]]\n* [[List of South Korean tourist attractions]]\n* [[National Treasure (South Korea)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book|title = Chasseurs de baleines, la frise du Bangudae|year = 2012|first = Sangmog|last = Lee|publisher = [[errance]]|isbn = 9782877724586}}\n* [[Kim, Won-yong]].

Since sea turtles come to the shore to spawn between early spring and summer, they are often regarded in ancient myth as symbolic animals crossing the boundary of sea and land. In the case of fish, heads of fish looking like sharks are depicted sideways, and there are salmon jumping above the sea surface. On later engravings there is the suggestion of a wooden fence, but since the inner outlines resemble fish and land animals are lacking the possibility of a fishpound has been considered.\n\n====Land animals====\nMost of the land animals are shown in a side view, which can best express the shape of four-limbed land animals. Some species can be classified according to the shape of body, skin patterns, the length of tail and legs, and the shoulder line. These include [[sika deer]], red deer, musk deer, roe deer, and water deer.\n\nSea birds are always placed around whales as they are hunting prey. Some engravings show mating and molt scenes of land animals and because of different patterns and angle of fall suggest the annual change of seasons and the breeding season.\n\n===Tools===\nTools  relating to hunting and fishing such as boats, floats, harpoons, fishing net, fish pounds, and bows provide information on the age of the rock art and livelihood of the time. This site also has scenes of whales and tigers being captured with a net. Although no prehistoric net has yet been excavated, fine marks of net on pottery discovered in the [[Dongsam-dong Shell Midden]] suggest that nets were widely used not only for fishing but also for hunting in those days.\n\nThe site has scenes showing whaling activities in great detail. Around 5\u201317 people are on boats surrounding whales. The bows and sterns are semi-circular and are connected to a harpoon stuck into the body of whales and to floats hanging on a rope. The tools are almost identical to those used by natives for whaling today.\n\n===Indeterminate figures===\nEngravings of uncertain theme and content have been classified into two types: those of unknown theme which are in good condition and those of unknown shape which have been worn and damaged over time and are therefore hard to decode. Some have signs with certain patterns, but it is hard to classify them on the basis of engravings on the rock alone. Signs are conceptual expressions that are impossible to find in real life but are repeated expressions of a certain pattern.\n\n==Dating==\nAccording to the results of an analysis of animal bones discovered in a shell midden in Ulsan and widespread along the southeastern coasts and of research on Ulsan Bay's archaeological environment, the site dates back to 7,000 to 3,500 years ago. Many relics related to the themes of the rock art were found at [[Neolithic]] sites, include deer pattern pottery, net pattern pottery and shell mask discovered in the Dongsam-dong Shell Midden in [[Busan]], a figure with human faces in Osan-ri in Yangyang, a small clay wild pig excavated from the shell midden on Yokjido island of [[Tongyeong]], the clay figure of a woman in Sinam-ri in Ulsan, and a small clay seal excavated from the shell midden in Sejuk-ri, Ulsan. Furthermore, a boat was excavated from the shell midden in Bibong-ri, Changnyeong, and during the Hwangseong-dong site excavation research project conducted by the Korea Archaeology and Art History Research Institute a whale bone stuck with a harpoon was found, which empirically proves whaling.\n\nThe layers which contain the bones of captured whales date back to 5500 to 4700 BP. Consequently, considering livelihoods in that period, hunting and fishing tools, related relics, and contemporary contents, the rock art seems to have been made between the early and mid-Neolithic era. Before the site was discovered, the first whaling was thought to have taken place between the 10th and 11th century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Lee|first1= Sang-Mog|last2= Robineau|first2= Daniel|date= April 1, 2004|title= The cetaceans of the Neolithic rock carvings of Bangu-dae (South Korea) and the beginning of whaling in the North-West Pacific|url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003552104000020|journal= L'Anthropologie|volume= 108|issue= 1|pages= 137-151|doi= |access-date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nFrom the abundant representations of marine animals, the site seems to be in close relationship with hunter-fishers attributed to the Neolithic era (between 8000 BP and 3500 BP). Consequently, the Bangudae site has the most ancient evidence of whaling worldwide and is considered highly important not only as a first whaling representation, but also for understanding prehistoric maritime culture in the northern Pacific area.\n\n== Preservation concerns ==\nThe Sayeon Dam, built from 1962 to 1965 and expanded between 1999 and 2002, helps supply Ulsan with drinking water but has caused the rocks on which the petroglyphs are carved to be flooded for about eight months of every year. This periodic flooding raises concerns of erosion and water damage of the rock-art motifs, which are considered to be masterpieces of prehistoric art and an invaluable source of prehistoric information. The government of Korea is considering building a polycarbonate \u201cdam\u201d to protect the rock faces.\n\n[[File:Bangudae2.jpg|thumb|Banguda scene, source: Ulsan Petroglyph Museum]]\n[[File:Bangudae3.jpg|thumb|Bangudae rock images, source: Ulsan Petroglyph Museum]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Prehistoric Korea]]\n* [[Jeulmun pottery period]]\n* [[Mumun pottery period]]\n* [[List of South Korean tourist attractions]]\n* [[National Treasure (South Korea)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book|title = Chasseurs de baleines, la frise du Bangudae|year = 2012|first = Sangmog|last = Lee|publisher = [[errance]]|isbn = 9782877724586}}\n* [[Kim, Won-yong]].
