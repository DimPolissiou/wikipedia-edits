The most influential specimen was [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1]] from [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints]], France. French palaeontologist [[Marcellin Boule]] authored several publications, among the first to establish palaeontology as a science, detailing the specimen, but reconstructed it as ape-like and only remotely related to modern humans. The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule\u2019s error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|pages=158\u2013164}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy was most likely not driven by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]]), pre-Neanderthals (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]]), and classic Neanderthals (MIS 4\u20133).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA; however, different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 592\u2013182 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

However, individuals with the 129 variant of the [[PRNP]] gene were naturally immune to the prions. Studying this gene led to the discovery that the 129 variant was widespread among all modern humans, which could indicate widespread cannibalism at some point in human prehistory. Because Neanderthals are known to have practised cannibalism to an extent and to have co-existed with modern humans, British palaeoanthropologist Simon Underdown speculated that modern humans transmitted a kuru-like spongiform disease to Neanderthals, and, because the 129 variant appears to have been absent in Neanderthals, it quickly killed them off.<ref name=underdown2008>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Underdown|year=2008|title=A potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal extinction|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=71|issue=1|pages=4\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.12.014|pmid=18280671}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Bello |first1= S.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy was most likely not driven by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]]), pre-Neanderthals (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]]), and classic Neanderthals (MIS 4\u20133).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA; however, different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 592\u2013182 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

However, individuals with the 129 variant of the [[PRNP]] gene were naturally immune to the prions. Studying this gene led to the discovery that the 129 variant was widespread among all modern humans, which could indicate widespread cannibalism at some point in human prehistory. Because Neanderthals are known to have practised cannibalism to an extent and to have co-existed with modern humans, British palaeoanthropologist Simon Underdown speculated that modern humans transmitted a kuru-like spongiform disease to Neanderthals, and, because the 129 variant appears to have been absent in Neanderthals, it quickly killed them off.<ref name=underdown2008>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Underdown|year=2008|title=A potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal extinction|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=71|issue=1|pages=4\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.12.014|pmid=18280671}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Bello |first1= S.

Dead zones are caused by oxygen-depleting factors which include, but are not limited to, human pollution (4). This is a process called eutrophication, where oxygen levels decrease as elements such nitrogen and phosphorus increase. A healthy river will have increased amounts of oxygen for consumption by organisms (1). As nitrogen increases, algae (5) produce large amounts of oxygen, but die from increased nitrogen. Decomposers then use all of the remaining oxygen decomposing the algae, resulting in no oxygen left and no oxygen being produced. (2).]]\n\nIn March 2004, when the recently established [[UN Environment Programme]] published its first [[UN Environment Programme|Global Environment Outlook Year Book]] (''GEO Year Book 2003''), it reported 146 dead zones in the world's oceans where [[marine life]] could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels. Some of these were as small as a square kilometre (0.4&nbsp;mi\u00b2), but the largest dead zone covered 70,000 square kilometres (27,000&nbsp;mi\u00b2).

In fall months, tropical storms begin to enter the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and break up the dead zones, and the cycle repeats again in the spring.]]\n\nAquatic and marine dead zones can be caused by an increase in nutrients (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus) in the water, known as [[eutrophication]]. These chemicals are the fundamental building blocks of single-celled, plant-like organisms that live in the water column, and whose growth is limited in part by the availability of these materials. Eutrophication can lead to rapid increases in the density of certain types of these [[phytoplankton]], a phenomenon known as an [[algal bloom]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Limnologist]] Dr. [[David Schindler]], whose research at the [[Experimental Lakes Area]] led to the banning of harmful phosphates in detergents, warned about algal blooms and dead zones, <blockquote>\"The fish-killing blooms that devastated the Great Lakes in the 1960s and 1970s haven't gone away; they've moved west into an arid world in which people, industry, and agriculture are increasingly taxing the quality of what little freshwater there is to be had here....This isn't just a prairie problem.

Increase in input of nitrogen and phosphorus generally causes Cyanobacteria to bloom. Other algae are consumed and thus do not accumulate to the same extent as Cyanobacteria.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Cyanobacteria are not good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. The bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]. Dead zones can be caused by natural and by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors. Natural causes include coastal upwelling and changes in wind and water circulation patterns. Use of chemical [[fertilizer]]s is considered the major human-related cause of dead zones around the world. Runoff from sewage, urban land use, and fertilizers can also contribute to eutrophication.<ref name=\"msnbc\">[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/22301669 Corn boom could expand 'dead zone' in Gulf] NBC News.msn.com</ref>\n\nNotable dead zones in the United States include the northern Gulf of Mexico region,<ref name=\"economist.com\"/> surrounding the outfall of the Mississippi River, the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, and the Elizabeth River in Virginia Beach, all of which have been shown to be recurring events over the last several years.\n\nAdditionally, natural oceanographic phenomena can cause deoxygenation of parts of the water column.

Dead zones are caused by oxygen-depleting factors which include, but are not limited to, human pollution (4). This is a process called eutrophication, where oxygen levels decrease as elements such nitrogen and phosphorus increase. A healthy river will have increased amounts of oxygen for consumption by organisms (1). As nitrogen increases, algae (5) produce large amounts of oxygen, but die from increased nitrogen. Decomposers then use all of the remaining oxygen decomposing the algae, resulting in no oxygen left and no oxygen being produced. (2).]]\n\nIn March 2004, when the recently established [[UN Environment Programme]] published its first [[UN Environment Programme|Global Environment Outlook Year Book]] (''GEO Year Book 2003''), it reported 146 dead zones in the world's oceans where [[marine life]] could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels.

Increase in input of nitrogen and phosphorus generally causes Cyanobacteria to bloom. Other algae are consumed and thus do not accumulate to the same extent as Cyanobacteria.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Cyanobacteria are not good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. The bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]. Dead zones can be caused by natural and by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors. Natural causes include coastal upwelling and changes in wind and water circulation patterns. Use of chemical [[fertilizer]]s is considered the major human-related cause of dead zones around the world.

Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin.\n\nThe [[genetics]] of red hair appear to be associated with the [[melanocortin-1 receptor]] (MC1R), which is found on [[chromosome 16]]. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant.<ref name=valverde>{{cite journal |vauthors=Valverde P, Healy E, Jackson I, Rees JL, Thody AJ |title=Variants of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene are associated with red hair and fair skin in humans |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=328\u201330 |year=1995 |pmid=7581459 |doi=10.1038/ng1195-328}}</ref>\n\nRed hair is associated with fair skin color because low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair caused by a MC1R mutation can cause both. The lower melanin concentration in skin confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important [[Vitamin D]] can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer. The MC1R variant gene that gives people red hair generally results in skin that is difficult or impossible to [[Sun tanning|tan]]. Because of the natural tanning reaction to the sun's ultraviolet light and high amounts of pheomelanin in the skin, [[freckle]]s are a common but not universal feature of red-haired people.\n\nRed hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal [[recessive gene|recessive]]. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be [[Genetic carrier|carrier]]s for the gene and have a redheaded child.\n\nGenetic studies of [[dizygotic]] (fraternal) twins indicate that the MC1R gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the MC1R gene necessary, but not sufficient, for red hair production.<ref name=\"boxwyeth\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Box NF, Wyeth JR, etal |title= Characterization of melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor variant alleles in twins with red hair.|journal= Human Molecular Genetics |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=1891\u201397 |date=October 1997 |pmid=9302268 |doi=10.1093/hmg/6.11.1891}}</ref>\n\n=== Genetics ===\nThe alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, [[Asp294His]], and Arg142His on [[MC1R]] are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype.<ref name=\"harding\">{{cite journal |author = Harding, Rosalind M. |pmid = 10733465 |title = Evidence for Variable Selective Pressures at MC1R |journal = [[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |date=April 2000 |volume = 66 |issue = 4 |pages = 1351\u201361 |doi = 10.1086/302863 |pmc = 1288200\n|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The gene ''HCL2'' (also called ''RHC'' or ''RHA'') on [[chromosome 4]] may also be related to red hair.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/4842|title=HGNC Symbol Report:HCL2|website=Gene.ucl.ac.uk|accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.1987.tb03339.x |author = H.

The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by [[Walter Bodmer|Bodmer]] and [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents [[rickets]] in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of [[vitamin D]] production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin.<ref>Bodmer WF, Cavalli-Sforza LL.Genetics, evolution and man. San Francisco:WH Freeman; 1976.</ref> In 2000, Harding ''et al.'' concluded that red hair is not the result of positive selection but of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun harm pale skin.

Red hair has far more of the pigment pheomelanin than it has of the dark pigment eumelanin.\n\nThe [[genetics]] of red hair appear to be associated with the [[melanocortin-1 receptor]] (MC1R), which is found on [[chromosome 16]]. Eighty percent of redheads have an MC1R gene variant.<ref name=valverde>{{cite journal |vauthors=Valverde P, Healy E, Jackson I, Rees JL, Thody AJ |title=Variants of the melanocyte-stimulating hormone receptor gene are associated with red hair and fair skin in humans |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=328\u201330 |year=1995 |pmid=7581459 |doi=10.1038/ng1195-328}}</ref>\n\nRed hair is associated with fair skin color because low concentrations of eumelanin throughout the body of those with red hair caused by a MC1R mutation can cause both. The lower melanin concentration in skin confers the advantage that a sufficient concentration of important [[Vitamin D]] can be produced under low light conditions. However, when UV-radiation is strong (as in regions close to the equator) the lower concentration of melanin leads to several medical disadvantages, such as a higher risk of skin cancer. The MC1R variant gene that gives people red hair generally results in skin that is difficult or impossible to [[Sun tanning|tan]]. Because of the natural tanning reaction to the sun's ultraviolet light and high amounts of pheomelanin in the skin, [[freckle]]s are a common but not universal feature of red-haired people.\n\nRed hair can originate from several changes on the MC1R-gene. If one of these changes is present on both chromosomes then the respective individual is likely to have red hair. This type of inheritance is described as an autosomal [[recessive gene|recessive]]. Even if both parents do not have red hair themselves, both can be [[Genetic carrier|carrier]]s for the gene and have a redheaded child.\n\nGenetic studies of [[dizygotic]] (fraternal) twins indicate that the MC1R gene is not solely responsible for the red hair phenotype; unidentified modifier genes exist, making variance in the MC1R gene necessary, but not sufficient, for red hair production.<ref name=\"boxwyeth\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Box NF, Wyeth JR, etal |title= Characterization of melanocyte stimulating hormone receptor variant alleles in twins with red hair.|journal= Human Molecular Genetics |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=1891\u201397 |date=October 1997 |pmid=9302268 |doi=10.1093/hmg/6.11.1891}}</ref>\n\n=== Genetics ===\nThe alleles Arg151Cys, Arg160Trp, [[Asp294His]], and Arg142His on [[MC1R]] are shown to be recessives for the red hair phenotype.<ref name=\"harding\">{{cite journal |author = Harding, Rosalind M. |pmid = 10733465 |title = Evidence for Variable Selective Pressures at MC1R |journal = [[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |date=April 2000 |volume = 66 |issue = 4 |pages = 1351\u201361 |doi = 10.1086/302863 |pmc = 1288200\n|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The gene ''HCL2'' (also called ''RHC'' or ''RHA'') on [[chromosome 4]] may also be related to red hair.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.genenames.org/data/gene-symbol-report/#!/hgnc_id/4842|title=HGNC Symbol Report:HCL2|website=Gene.ucl.ac.uk|accessdate=19 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.1987.tb03339.x |author = H.

The non-tanning skin associated with red hair may have been advantageous in far-northern climates where sunlight is scarce. Studies by [[Walter Bodmer|Bodmer]] and [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza|Cavalli-Sforza]] (1976) hypothesized that lighter skin pigmentation prevents [[rickets]] in colder climates by encouraging higher levels of [[vitamin D]] production and also allows the individual to retain heat better than someone with darker skin.<ref>Bodmer WF, Cavalli-Sforza LL.Genetics, evolution and man. San Francisco:WH Freeman; 1976.</ref> In 2000, Harding ''et al.'' concluded that red hair is not the result of positive selection but of a lack of negative selection. In Africa, for example, red hair is selected against because high levels of sun harm pale skin.

The service was successful at first but declined later, closing in 1930.

At the time Whimsey was an important centre of the mineral extraction industry in the Forest of Dean. The Monmouth and Hereford Railway was incorporated in 1845, but limited in scope by Parliament, and the powers were not exercised. However, in 1851 the ''Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway'' received its authorising Act of Parliament, and it opened a line on a similar alignment from Hereford to [[Grange Court]] on 1 June 1855.

The South Wales Railway converted part of the FoDR network to a broad gauge railway branch, and this was completed to Whimsey in 1854. It was realised that Whimsey was close to the Mitcheldean Road station of the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway, and a branch connection would give a useful northward and westward outlet to South Wales industrial sites and to the West Midlands for the minerals of Whimsey, and on 29 November 1856 details were published of a proposed ''Forest of Dean Central, Lydbrook & Hereford, Ross & Gloucester Junction Railway''. This was to extend the Forest of Dean Central Railway northwards to Mitcheldean Road and later to [[Ledbury]]; but in fact nothing came of the idea.<ref name = paar/>\n\n==A viable scheme at last==\nThe plan was dormant for several years until 1870 when a bill was deposited in for the \"Mitcheldean Road and Whimsey Railway\". The terrain was extremely difficult, and the line would climb from Mitcheldean Road at 1 in 30 and 1 in 34 to a summit near Drybrook, and then descend at 1 in 40 towards Whimsey.\n\nAt first the line was opposed by the Great Western Railway and the [[Severn and Wye Railway]], both of which regarded it as a threat to their traffic. On 22 May 1871 a meeting was held at Paddington between GWR directors, an S&WR deputation and Alfred and Thomas Goold, representing the Mitcheldean Road concern. The Goolds claimed that the line was necessary for the development of the iron ore at Drybrook, Westbury Brook and Wigpool, and said that if the S&WR had given any assurance that it would be constructing its Lydbrook Valley line in the near future, the bill would never have been promoted. The GWR offered to accommodate the traffic and to reimburse the expenses of the bill, but the promoters declined. The GWR then declared its implacable opposition to the scheme, but a select committee of the House of Lords gave the GWR and S&WR short shrift, finding that they had no proper grounds for opposition, and the Bill went forward smoothly.<ref name = paar/>\n\nThe name of the incorporated company was changed slightly, and the ''Mitcheldean Road & Forest of Dean Junction Railway'' Act was passed on 13 July 1871.<ref name = carter>{{cite book| first=E.F.| last=Carter| title=An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles| publisher=Cassell| location=London| year=1959}}</ref> The company had powers to build a railway 4 miles 5 furlongs in length from Mitcheldean Road station to the Forest of Dean Railway branch at Whimsey. The capital was \u00a330,000 in \u00a310 shares, and there were borrowing powers for \u00a310,000. The GWR was authorised to subscribe up to half the capital. Five years were allowed for completion of the line; there was no mention of carrying passengers. The engineer's estimate for construction was \u00a328,268, no stations being envisaged. The company was authorised to enter into agreements with the GWR for working and maintaining the line. By the time of the Act, the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway line was standard gauge but the Forest of Dean Railway branch was still broad gauge, giving the Mitcheldean Road company a significant, but temporary, commercial advantage, in that onward transit of loaded wagons did not require transshipment.<ref name = paar/>\n\n==Construction difficulties==\nThe first ordinary meeting of the company on 13 January 1872 was abortive as only the Goolds were present and there was no quorum, so that no business could be transacted. At a shareholders\u2019 meeting on 8 May it was decided to ask the GWR to work the line for 55% instead of the agreed 60% of the receipts, if the ruling gradient was reduced by substituting a tunnel at the summit for the cutting originally proposed. A ruling gradient of 1 in 35 was now to be achieved, by construction of a 638-yard Euroclydon tunnel, as well as another tunnel 97 yards in length and a very deep cutting at Drybrook.<ref group = note>The business calculation was therefore that a moderately long tunnel would be paid for by a 5% margin on forward expenses.</ref>\n\nAt a meeting on 6 June 1873 the proposed working agreement with the GWR was adopted. The tender for construction of the line by Miller & Roberts in the sum of \u00a330,000 was accepted. G Wells Owen was the company's engineer. Construction began in 1874 and in May the secretary, Thomas Goold, and Alfred Goold, having walked over the line, suggested that the tunnel should be lengthened and a deviation made at Drybrook. This was agreed, and Crown sanction was received for the changes on 2 July 1874.\n\nRelations between the company and the contractor were unhappy, and there were complaints about slow progress and counter-claims about obstruction. The company engineer's assistant Coulthard had \"ordered the North heading of the tunnel to be stopped in consequence of an error in his engineering by which the tunnel had been driven out of its proper course past the No. 1 shaft without touching it\". The outcome of all this was the contractor's abandonment of the work.\n\nThe company took over the work, and on 10 December Coulthard reported that a shaft, abandoned because the contractor could not complete its sinking, had been finished by him within three days and had struck the tunnel only 3 inches out of line instead of 7 feet off as the contractor had forecast. By 29 February 1876 considerable progress had been made and work was expected to be finished by July or August. This proved considerably optimistic, but in August 1876 it was reported that \"The Mitcheldean Road and Whimsey Railroad is so far progressing that it is expected that the line will be completed by December next, when it is proposed to open it; it is intended to carry passengers as well as mineral traffic\".\n\nThis forecast too proved unreliable, and on 20 July 1877 the directors decided to dispense with Coulthard's services, as he had misled them as to the time of completion and cost. W G Owen estimated that well over \u00a35,000 was needed to complete the line. A new contractor, Griffiths of Lydney was approached to take over the work, but he declined. A Mr Harris then took over supervision of the works but, owing to some misunderstanding, dismissed all the workmen so that work had stopped entirely by mid-September except in the tunnel. On 9 October 1877 W G Owen reported that \u00a312,000 would still be required to complete it.<ref name = paar/>\n\n==Taken over by the Great Western Railway==\nBy now the \u00a310,000 from the GWR had been swallowed up, with little to show for it, and the GWR demanded an inspection of the accounts. On 18 October, Hadingham, the company clerk, travelled to  London with the books, and GWR officials began to reaudit the accounts. When they wrote to Thomas Goold for various documents and bills to help them in their task he decided to call a halt. He pointed out that the GWR had two seats on the board, but that their nominees had never attended a meeting, and if they were to allow the GWR to audit their accounts they might have to extend the same facility to all other shareholders.\n\nNevertheless, the company itself was incapable of progressing the construction, and by early 1878 the GWR had made traffic and working agreements with the company, and the GWR Act of 22 July 1878 enabled the GWR to subscribe a further \u00a320,000 to the undertaking. Daniel Gooch of the GWR became the company chairman and board meetings were held at Paddington instead of at Newnham. Still the line lay moribund for some two years until the GWR took over completely. An Act of 6 August 1880 authorised the GWR to absorb the undertaking<ref name = carter/><ref name = awdry/> and to complete the line, which it did at a further cost of \u00a321,626, making a total cost to the GWR of \u00a360,626. Still with the line completed, the GWR made no attempt to open it to traffic: economic depression dominated the Forest economy; moreover the completion of the S&WR Lydbrook extension provided a much more direct outlet for traffic from the northern part of the Forest to South Wales.\n\nBy now the GWR was well established in the southern and eastern part of the Forest, and a northern outlet was less important. Workings in the southern part of the originally planned route could conveniently be given a southerly connection, and about a mile at that end was opened for mineral traffic in July 1885, from Speedwell Siding down to Whimsey.<ref name = awdry>{{cite book| first=Christopher| last=Awdry| title=Encyclopedia of British Railway Companies| publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited| location=Wellingborough| year=1990| isbn=1-85260-049-7}}</ref><ref name = paar/>\n\n==Passenger trains at the southern end==\nIn 1906 the Great Western Railway had achieved much success in introducing rail-motors, sometimes known as auto-trains, on existing lines. The system was to provide low-cost stopping places at hitherto unserved points on existing lines. The railmotors were either a combined passenger carriage and small integrated steam engine power unit, or later, a small separate locomotive. In either case control of the engine from the remote end of the vehicle was possible, avoiding the necessity of running round the train at terminals.\n\nThe population of the more remote areas around Drybrook, families of miners mostly, agitated for such a service on their mineral line:\n\n<blockquote>The success of rail motor services on many hitherto unremunerative branch lines has brought to the front the possibility of re-opening abandoned lines to be worked on the new method. The Great Western Railway have been asked to establish a motor service on the Whimsey branch, between Mitcheldean Road and Cinderford. The Whimsey line was constructed some years ago by a company, which, finding they had not enough capital to work it successfully, sold it to the Great Western Railway in expectation that they would work it, but they decided to keep it closed. The Great Western Railway have replied to the petitioners that they are afraid that the possibility of getting a reasonable return for such service is not such as would justify the heavy capital expense that would be involved, and as the population served only numbers about 9,000, the caution of the railway in the matter appears perfectly justifiable.<ref name = rlymag1906>{{cite magazine| title=What Our Railway are Doing| magazine=Railway Magazine| date=May 1906}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn fact in 1907 the system was introduced on the old Bullo Pill line from Newnham and on the lower part of the Whimsey line as far as Steam Mills Crossing on 3 August 1907. 20,824 passengers were carried in the first six weeks, including 3,319 on the August Bank Holiday. A further 41 chains of the Mitcheldean Road route was opened on 4 November 1907, from Speedwell to Drybrook.<ref name = awdry/> The GWR had been asked to establish a passenger service between Mitcheldean Road and Cinderford, over the whole of the Mitcheldean Road route, but the GWR saw that the financial return would not justify the heavy capital expense as the population to be served was very limited.<ref name = paar/>\n\nThe 1922 Bradshaw public timetable shows \"Auto-cars -- one class only\" between Newnham and Drybrook Halt. There are departures at 08:25, 11:30, 14:40 (not continuing beyond Cinderford except on Saturdays), 17:36, 19:50 (not continuing beyond Cinderford on Thursdays and Saturday), and 21:18 (Thursdays and Saturdays only). Intermediate stations between Newnham and Drybrook Halt were Cinderford and Whimsey Halt, and there were halts at Steam Mills Crossing and Nailbridge between Whimsey and Drybrook.<ref name = bradshaw1922>{{cite book| title=Bradshaw's July 1922 Railway Guide| edition=facsimile| publisher=Book Club Associates| year=1985}}</ref>\n\nThere was no direct route from Cinderford station northwards, and the northbound trains must have run to Bilson Junction (that is, towards Newnham), reversing there to continue northwards. The publicly advertised journey time from Cinderford to Whimsey Halt was 8 minutes; the distance is less than a mile.\n\nThe passenger service from Cinderford to Drybrook was withdrawn from 7 July 1930.<ref name = maggs>{{cite book| first=Colin G.| last=Maggs| title=The Branch Lines of Gloucestershire| publisher=Amberley Publishing| location=Stroud| year=2009| isbn=978-184-868-3488}}</ref>\n\n==Abandonment of the north end==\nThe running track had been laid throughout the route to Mitcheldean Road, and was maintained for many years by the GWR. At Mitcheldean Road the line terminated in the goods yard; to enter it from the station required two reversals and the short terminal neck would have prevented a long train from using the line, as well as precluding any possibility of a run at the 1 in 38 bank.\n\nThe rails between Drybrook Quarry and Mitcheldean Road were taken up between 8 and 17 February 1917, in common with those on many disused and lightly used branches, the track being in demand in France during [[World War I]]. During [[World War II]], Euroclydon tunnel (so named by Paar; Cooke calls it Drybrook Tunnel;<ref name = cooke/> Maggs calls it Hawthorns Tunnel<ref name = maggs/>) was used by the Admiralty for storing ammunition.\n\nAn ammunition train was sent to the location by the Admiralty without prior arrangement with the GWR; the GWR informed the Admiralty that the track into the tunnel was not usable, and proper arrangements had to be made hastily. In due course narrow gauge track was laid from what became Admiralty Siding into the tunnel. Daily train movements took place for a time.<ref name = maggs/> The ammunition usage ceased after the cessation of hostilities;  in 1957 the tunnel was used briefly for the cultivation of mushrooms.<ref name = paar/>\n\nIn 1959 Berry Wiggins established a bitumen plant at Whimsey, immediately south of Steam Mills Crossing. Bitumen was loaded away from the depot. The last such consignment was on 1 May 1967 and the stub of the branch closed on 1 August 1967.<ref name = maggs/>\n\n==Description of the route==\nWriting originally in 1965, Paar said \"The whole route can still be followed. Beginning in Mitcheldean Road station yard the line immediately began to climb at 1 in 38, curving south-west and crossing two lanes, the first by an underbridge and the second on the level. It continued to climb along a wooded hillside, crossed over a track by a wooden bridge now dismantled, and under a road by a stone arch bridge. After just over two miles the line entered Euroclydon tunnel, which took its name from Euroclydon House on the hill above. The steep gradient continued through the tunnel to the summit where, in 2{{frac|1|2}} miles, the line had climbed 321 feet. Thence it fell at 1 in 42 and 1 in 54 through the short Drybrook tunnel, and continued south to Whimsey where it made an end-on junction with the Forest of Dean Branch.\"\n\nPaar described the line from Whimsey to Drybrook in the reverse direction: Whimsey was the terminus of the branch (from Bullo Pill) from 1854 until the Mitcheldean Road line was built. After lying unused for some years, the section from Whimsey to Speedwell sidings was opened by the GWR in July 1885. Steam Mills halt was on the up side beyond a level crossing, after which came a shallow embankment, a bridge across the tramroad, an unusual joint bridge taking the Trafalgar tramway and the railway under a road, a skew girder bridge across the tramway, and Nailbridge halt (up side). Immediately beyond the halt was a bridge carrying the Drybrook road, followed by Speedwell siding, a loop to the running line, serving the Speedwell Newbridge level. Though officially closed in 1897, activity continued thereafter and the siding connections were not finally taken out of use until 6 January 1938.\n\nSubsequently, the product of quarry operations was the commercial traffic of the line. After the Second World War rail traffic to and from the quarries dwindled, and ceased in February 1953. The line was severed north of Whimsey as there was no other traffic. Early in 1957 track lifting was completed from Drybrook to Steam Mills.<ref name = paar/>\n\nIn 1924, the development of Harrow Hill colliery, on the up side, led to the provision of two new sidings, with connections at both ends. North of Speedwell, the Mitcheldean line remained out of use until opened in 1907 for rail-motor services to Drybrook halt (up side), preceding which bridges carried the line over the Trafalgar tramway and a lane. Yet a further {{frac|1|4}} mile fragment of the line was opened as late as 18 October 1928, from Drybrook halt to Drybrook quarries. Two over-bridges and a short tunnel were traversed on this section, and as the gradient fell towards Bilson at 1 in 46, catch-points were provided north of the halt to protect the auto-train from runaways. At the quarries, two sidings were provided on the down side, looped to the running line.<ref name = paar/>\n\n==Topography==\n\n* Mitcheldean Road; on Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway;\n* ''Euroclydon Tunnel'';\n* ''Admiralty siding'';\n* ''Drybrook Quarry'';\n* ''Drybrook Tunnel''; Maggs refers to this as Hawthorne Tunnel;<ref name = maggs/>\n* Drybrook Halt;\n* ''Harrow Hill Siding'';\n* ''Speedwell Siding'';\n* Nailbridge Halt;\n* Steam Mills Crossing;\n* ''Whimsey goods''; later named Cinderford goods;\n* (end of Mitcheldean Road and Forest of Dean Railway section);\n* Whimsey Halt;\n* ''Whimsey Junction'' (with former Forest of Dean Railway, towards Newnham).\n\nThe section from Whimsey goods to Whimsey Junction was originally part of the Bullo Pill Railway, later the forest of Dean Railway.\n\nCooke describes the section as the ''Cinderford Branch''.<ref name = cooke>{{cite book| first=R.A.| last=Cooke| title=Atlas of the Great Western Railway, 1947| publisher=Wild Swan Publications Limited| location=Didcot| year=1997| isbn=1-874103-38-0}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lea Bailey Light Railway]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist | group = note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|United Kingdom}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mitcheldean Road and Forest of Dean Junction Railway}}\n{{Transport in Gloucestershire}}\n[[Category:Rail transport in Herefordshire]]\n[[Category:History of Herefordshire]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:History of Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge railways in England]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Independent railway company in England}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2015}}\n{{Mitcheldean Road & Forest of Dean Junction Railway|collapse=yes}}\n[[File:Mitcheldean Road & Forest of Dean Junction Railway trackbed at Lea Bailey.jpg|thumb|right|A bridge carrying the road from Lea Bailey to Drybrook over the former trackbed of the Railway]]\n[[File:South portal of Hawthorns Tunnel, Drybrook.jpg|thumb|right|South portal of the {{convert|638|yd|m}} Hawthorne Tunnel near [[Drybrook]].]]\n\n{{Railways of the Forest of Dean|collapse=yes}}\n\nThe '''Mitcheldean Road and Forest of Dean Junction Railway''' was an independent railway company incorporated in 1871, to provide a northerly outlet for iron ore and coal products from the [[Cinderford]] and Whimsey area in the [[Forest of Dean]], to the [[Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway]] line; mineral traffic to industrial centres in South Wales and the Midlands was foreseen.\n\nThe company ran out of money during construction, and the [[Great Western Railway]] purchased it and completed the line about 1882.

This was to extend the Forest of Dean Central Railway northwards to Mitcheldean Road and later to [[Ledbury]]; but in fact nothing came of the idea.<ref name = paar/>\n\n==A viable scheme at last==\nThe plan was dormant for several years until 1870 when a bill was deposited in for the \"Mitcheldean Road and Whimsey Railway\". The terrain was extremely difficult, and the line would climb from Mitcheldean Road at 1 in 30 and 1 in 34 to a summit near Drybrook, and then descend at 1 in 40 towards Whimsey.\n\nAt first the line was opposed by the Great Western Railway and the [[Severn and Wye Railway]], both of which regarded it as a threat to their traffic. On 22 May 1871 a meeting was held at Paddington between GWR directors, an S&WR deputation and Alfred and Thomas Goold, representing the Mitcheldean Road concern. The Goolds claimed that the line was necessary for the development of the iron ore at Drybrook, Westbury Brook and Wigpool, and said that if the S&WR had given any assurance that it would be constructing its Lydbrook Valley line in the near future, the bill would never have been promoted. The GWR offered to accommodate the traffic and to reimburse the expenses of the bill, but the promoters declined. The GWR then declared its implacable opposition to the scheme, but a select committee of the House of Lords gave the GWR and S&WR short shrift, finding that they had no proper grounds for opposition, and the Bill went forward smoothly.<ref name = paar/>\n\nThe name of the incorporated company was changed slightly, and the ''Mitcheldean Road & Forest of Dean Junction Railway'' Act was passed on 13 July 1871.<ref name = carter>{{cite book| first=E.F.| last=Carter| title=An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles| publisher=Cassell| location=London| year=1959}}</ref> The company had powers to build a railway 4 miles 5 furlongs in length from Mitcheldean Road station to the Forest of Dean Railway branch at Whimsey. The capital was \u00a330,000 in \u00a310 shares, and there were borrowing powers for \u00a310,000. The GWR was authorised to subscribe up to half the capital. Five years were allowed for completion of the line; there was no mention of carrying passengers. The engineer's estimate for construction was \u00a328,268, no stations being envisaged. The company was authorised to enter into agreements with the GWR for working and maintaining the line. By the time of the Act, the Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway line was standard gauge but the Forest of Dean Railway branch was still broad gauge, giving the Mitcheldean Road company a significant, but temporary, commercial advantage, in that onward transit of loaded wagons did not require transshipment.<ref name = paar/>\n\n==Construction difficulties==\nThe first ordinary meeting of the company on 13 January 1872 was abortive as only the Goolds were present and there was no quorum, so that no business could be transacted. At a shareholders\u2019 meeting on 8 May it was decided to ask the GWR to work the line for 55% instead of the agreed 60% of the receipts, if the ruling gradient was reduced by substituting a tunnel at the summit for the cutting originally proposed. A ruling gradient of 1 in 35 was now to be achieved, by construction of a 638-yard Euroclydon tunnel, as well as another tunnel 97 yards in length and a very deep cutting at Drybrook.<ref group = note>The business calculation was therefore that a moderately long tunnel would be paid for by a 5% margin on forward expenses.</ref>\n\nAt a meeting on 6 June 1873 the proposed working agreement with the GWR was adopted. The tender for construction of the line by Miller & Roberts in the sum of \u00a330,000 was accepted. G Wells Owen was the company\u2019s engineer. Construction began in 1874 and in May the secretary, Thomas Goold, and Alfred Goold, having walked over the line, suggested that the tunnel should be lengthened and a deviation made at Drybrook. This was agreed, and Crown sanction was received for the changes on 2 July 1874.\n\nRelations between the company and the contractor were unhappy, and there were complaints about slow progress and counter-claims about obstruction. The company engineer's assistant Coulthard had \"ordered the North heading of the tunnel to be stopped in consequence of an error in his engineering by which the tunnel had been driven out of its proper course past the No. 1 shaft without touching it\". The outcome of all this was the contractor's abandonment of the work.\n\nThe company took over the work, and on 10 December Coulthard reported that a shaft, abandoned because the contractor could not complete its sinking, had been finished by him within three days and had struck the tunnel only 3 inches out of line instead of 7 feet off as the contractor had forecast. By 29 February 1876 considerable progress had been made and work was expected to be finished by July or August. This proved considerably optimistic, but in August 1876 it was reported that \"The Mitcheldean Road and Whimsey Railroad is so far progressing that it is expected that the line will be completed by December next, when it is proposed to open it; it is intended to carry passengers as well as mineral traffic\".\n\nThis forecast too proved unreliable, and on 20 July 1877 the directors decided to dispense with Coulthard's services, as he had misled them as to the time of completion and cost. W G Owen estimated that well over \u00a35,000 was needed to complete the line. A new contractor, Griffiths of Lydney was approached to take over the work, but he declined. A Mr Harris then took over supervision of the works but, owing to some misunderstanding, dismissed all the workmen so that work had stopped entirely by mid-September except in the tunnel. On 9 October 1877 W G Owen reported that \u00a312,000 would still be required to complete it.<ref name = paar/>\n\n==Taken over by the Great Western Railway==\nBy now the \u00a310,000 from the GWR had been swallowed up, with little to show for it, and the GWR demanded an inspection of the accounts. On 18 October, Hadingham, the company clerk, travelled to  London with the books, and GWR officials began to reaudit the accounts. When they wrote to Thomas Goold for various documents and bills to help them in their task he decided to call a halt. He pointed out that the GWR had two seats on the board, but that their nominees had never attended a meeting, and if they were to allow the GWR to audit their accounts they might have to extend the same facility to all other shareholders.\n\nNevertheless, the company itself was incapable of progressing the construction, and by early 1878 the GWR had made traffic and working agreements with the company, and the GWR Act of 22 July 1878 enabled the GWR to subscribe a further \u00a320,000 to the undertaking. Daniel Gooch of the GWR became the company chairman and board meetings were held at Paddington instead of at Newnham. Still the line lay moribund for some two years until the GWR took over completely. An Act of 6 August 1880 authorised the GWR to absorb the undertaking<ref name = carter/><ref name = awdry/> and to complete the line, which it did at a further cost of \u00a321,626, making a total cost to the GWR of \u00a360,626. Still with the line completed, the GWR made no attempt to open it to traffic: economic depression dominated the Forest economy; moreover the completion of the S&WR Lydbrook extension provided a much more direct outlet for traffic from the northern part of the Forest to South Wales.\n\nBy now the GWR was well established in the southern and eastern part of the Forest, and a northern outlet was less important. Workings in the southern part of the originally planned route could conveniently be given a southerly connection, and about a mile at that end was opened for mineral traffic in July 1885, from Speedwell Siding down to Whimsey.<ref name = awdry>{{cite book| first=Christopher| last=Awdry| title=Encyclopedia of British Railway Companies| publisher=Patrick Stephens Limited| location=Wellingborough| year=1990| isbn=1-85260-049-7}}</ref><ref name = paar/>\n\n==Passenger trains at the southern end==\nIn 1906 the Great Western Railway had achieved much success in introducing rail-motors, sometimes known as auto-trains, on existing lines. The system was to provide low-cost stopping places at hitherto unserved points on existing lines. The railmotors were either a combined passenger carriage and small integrated steam engine power unit, or later, a small separate locomotive. In either case control of the engine from the remote end of the vehicle was possible, avoiding the necessity of running round the train at terminals.\n\nThe population of the more remote areas around Drybrook, families of miners mostly, agitated for such a service on their mineral line:\n\n<blockquote>The success of rail motor services on many hitherto unremunerative branch lines has brought to the front the possibility of re-opening abandoned lines to be worked on the new method. The Great Western Railway have been asked to establish a motor service on the Whimsey branch, between Mitcheldean Road and Cinderford. The Whimsey line was constructed some years ago by a company, which, finding they had not enough capital to work it successfully, sold it to the Great Western Railway in expectation that they would work it, but they decided to keep it closed. The Great Western Railway have replied to the petitioners that they are afraid that the possibility of getting a reasonable return for such service is not such as would justify the heavy capital expense that would be involved, and as the population served only numbers about 9,000, the caution of the railway in the matter appears perfectly justifiable.<ref name = rlymag1906>{{cite magazine| title=What Our Railway are Doing| magazine=Railway Magazine| date=May 1906}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn fact in 1907 the system was introduced on the old Bullo Pill line from Newnham and on the lower part of the Whimsey line as far as Steam Mills Crossing on 3 August 1907. 20,824 passengers were carried in the first six weeks, including 3,319 on the August Bank Holiday. A further 41 chains of the Mitcheldean Road route was opened on 4 November 1907, from Speedwell to Drybrook.<ref name = awdry/> The GWR had been asked to establish a passenger service between Mitcheldean Road and Cinderford, over the whole of the Mitcheldean Road route, but the GWR saw that the financial return would not justify the heavy capital expense as the population to be served was very limited.<ref name = paar/>\n\nThe 1922 Bradshaw public timetable shows \"Auto-cars -- one class only\" between Newnham and Drybrook Halt. There are departures at 08:25, 11:30, 14:40 (not continuing beyond Cinderford except on Saturdays), 17:36, 19:50 (not continuing beyond Cinderford on Thursdays and Saturday), and 21:18 (Thursdays and Saturdays only). Intermediate stations between Newnham and Drybrook Halt were Cinderford and Whimsey Halt, and there were halts at Steam Mills Crossing and Nailbridge between Whimsey and Drybrook.<ref name = bradshaw1922>{{cite book| title=Bradshaw's July 1922 Railway Guide| edition=facsimile| publisher=Book Club Associates| year=1985}}</ref>\n\nThere was no direct route from Cinderford station northwards, and the northbound trains must have run to Bilson Junction (that is, towards Newnham), reversing there to continue northwards. The publicly advertised journey time from Cinderford to Whimsey Halt was 8 minutes; the distance is less than a mile.\n\nThe passenger service from Cinderford to Drybrook was withdrawn from 7 July 1930.<ref name = maggs>{{cite book| first=Colin G.| last=Maggs| title=The Branch Lines of Gloucestershire| publisher=Amberley Publishing| location=Stroud| year=2009| isbn=978-184-868-3488}}</ref>\n\n==Abandonment of the north end==\nThe running track had been laid throughout the route to Mitcheldean Road, and was maintained for many years by the GWR. At Mitcheldean Road the line terminated in the goods yard; to enter it from the station required two reversals and the short terminal neck would have prevented a long train from using the line, as well as precluding any possibility of a run at the 1 in 38 bank.\n\nThe rails between Drybrook Quarry and Mitcheldean Road were taken up between 8 and 17 February 1917, in common with those on many disused and lightly used branches, the track being in demand in France during [[World War I]]. During [[World War II]], Euroclydon tunnel (so named by Paar; Cooke calls it Drybrook Tunnel;<ref name = cooke/> Maggs calls it Hawthorns Tunnel<ref name = maggs/>) was used by the Admiralty for storing ammunition.\n\nAn ammunition train was sent to the location by the Admiralty without prior arrangement with the GWR; the GWR informed the Admiralty that the track into the tunnel was not usable, and proper arrangements had to be made hastily. In due course narrow gauge track was laid from what became Admiralty Siding into the tunnel. Daily train movements took place for a time.<ref name = maggs/> The ammunition usage ceased after the cessation of hostilities;  in 1957 the tunnel was used briefly for the cultivation of mushrooms.<ref name = paar/>\n\nIn 1959 Berry Wiggins established a bitumen plant at Whimsey, immediately south of Steam Mills Crossing. Bitumen was loaded away from the depot. The last such consignment was on 1 May 1967 and the stub of the branch closed on 1 August 1967.<ref name = maggs/>\n\n==Description of the route==\nWriting originally in 1965, Paar said \"The whole route can still be followed. Beginning in Mitcheldean Road station yard the line immediately began to climb at 1 in 38, curving south-west and crossing two lanes, the first by an underbridge and the second on the level. It continued to climb along a wooded hillside, crossed over a track by a wooden bridge now dismantled, and under a road by a stone arch bridge. After just over two miles the line entered Euroclydon tunnel, which took its name from Euroclydon House on the hill above. The steep gradient continued through the tunnel to the summit where, in 2{{frac|1|2}} miles, the line had climbed 321 feet. Thence it fell at 1 in 42 and 1 in 54 through the short Drybrook tunnel, and continued south to Whimsey where it made an end-on junction with the Forest of Dean Branch.\"\n\nPaar described the line from Whimsey to Drybrook in the reverse direction: Whimsey was the terminus of the branch (from Bullo Pill) from 1854 until the Mitcheldean Road line was built. After lying unused for some years, the section from Whimsey to Speedwell sidings was opened by the GWR in July 1885. Steam Mills halt was on the up side beyond a level crossing, after which came a shallow embankment, a bridge across the tramroad, an unusual joint bridge taking the Trafalgar tramway and the railway under a road, a skew girder bridge across the tramway, and Nailbridge halt (up side). Immediately beyond the halt was a bridge carrying the Drybrook road, followed by Speedwell siding, a loop to the running line, serving the Speedwell Newbridge level. Though officially closed in 1897, activity continued thereafter and the siding connections were not finally taken out of use until 6 January 1938.\n\nSubsequently, the product of quarry operations was the commercial traffic of the line. After the Second World War rail traffic to and from the quarries dwindled, and ceased in February 1953. The line was severed north of Whimsey as there was no other traffic. Early in 1957 track lifting was completed from Drybrook to Steam Mills.<ref name = paar/>\n\nIn 1924, the development of Harrow Hill colliery, on the up side, led to the provision of two new sidings, with connections at both ends. North of Speedwell, the Mitcheldean line remained out of use until opened in 1907 for rail-motor services to Drybrook halt (up side), preceding which bridges carried the line over the Trafalgar tramway and a lane. Yet a further {{frac|1|4}} mile fragment of the line was opened as late as 18 October 1928, from Drybrook halt to Drybrook quarries. Two over-bridges and a short tunnel were traversed on this section, and as the gradient fell towards Bilson at 1 in 46, catch-points were provided north of the halt to protect the auto-train from runaways. At the quarries, two sidings were provided on the down side, looped to the running line.<ref name = paar/>\n\n==Topography==\n\n* Mitcheldean Road; on Hereford, Ross and Gloucester Railway;\n* ''Euroclydon Tunnel'';\n* ''Admiralty siding'';\n* ''Drybrook Quarry'';\n* ''Drybrook Tunnel''; Maggs refers to this as Hawthorne Tunnel;<ref name = maggs/>\n* Drybrook Halt;\n* ''Harrow Hill Siding'';\n* ''Speedwell Siding'';\n* Nailbridge Halt;\n* Steam Mills Crossing;\n* ''Whimsey goods''; later named Cinderford goods;\n* (end of Mitcheldean Road and Forest of Dean Railway section);\n* Whimsey Halt;\n* ''Whimsey Junction'' (with former Forest of Dean Railway, towards Newnham).\n\nThe section from Whimsey goods to Whimsey Junction was originally part of the Bullo Pill Railway, later the forest of Dean Railway.\n\nCooke describes the section as the ''Cinderford Branch''.<ref name = cooke>{{cite book| first=R.A.| last=Cooke| title=Atlas of the Great Western Railway, 1947| publisher=Wild Swan Publications Limited| location=Didcot| year=1997| isbn=1-874103-38-0}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Lea Bailey Light Railway]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist | group = note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{coord missing|United Kingdom}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mitcheldean Road and Forest of Dean Junction Railway}}\n{{Transport in Gloucestershire}}\n[[Category:Rail transport in Herefordshire]]\n[[Category:History of Herefordshire]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:History of Gloucestershire]]\n[[Category:Standard gauge railways in England]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eConstruction difficulties:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitcheldean_Road_%26_Forest_of_Dean_Junction_Railway"}

In the 1950s, she was one of the founders of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and was [[first author]] of the influential [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]]. During the 1960s and 70s she worked on galaxy [[rotation curves]] and [[quasars]], discovering the [[most distant astronomical object]] then known. In the 1980s and 90s she helped develop and utilise the [[Faint Object Spectrograph]] on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Burbidge was well known for her work opposing [[discrimination against women]] in astronomy.\n\nBurbidge held several leadership and administrative posts, including [[Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory]] (1973\u201375), President of the [[American Astronomical Society]] (1976\u201378), and [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (1983).

In the 1950s, she was one of the founders of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] and was [[first author]] of the influential [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]]. During the 1960s and 70s she worked on galaxy [[rotation curves]] and [[quasars]], discovering the [[most distant astronomical object]] then known. In the 1980s and 90s she helped develop and utilise the [[Faint Object Spectrograph]] on the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. Burbidge was well known for her work opposing [[discrimination against women]] in astronomy.\n\nBurbidge held several leadership and administrative posts, including [[Director of the Royal Greenwich Observatory]] (1973\u201375), President of the [[American Astronomical Society]] (1976\u201378), and [[President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (1983). Burbidge worked at the [[UCL Observatory|University of London Observatory]], [[Yerkes Observatory]] of the [[University of Chicago]], the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] of the [[University of Cambridge]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], and the [[University of California San Diego]] (UCSD). From 1979 to 1988 she was the first director of the Center for Astronomy and Space Sciences at UCSD, where she worked from 1962 until her retirement.\n\n== Research career ==\nBurbidge studied at [[University College London]] (UCL), where she received an [[undergraduate degree]] in 1939 and a [[PhD]] in 1943.<ref name=snt/> During [[World War Two]], she acted as a [[caretaker]] at [[University of London Observatory]] (ULO); the [[Blackout_(wartime)#World_War_II|wartime blackout]] made it easier for her to use the observatory's telescopes.<ref name=nyt/> In August 1944, her observations at ULO were twice interrupted by [[V-1 flying bomb]] explosions nearby.<ref name=snt/> She was turned down for a [[postdoctoral fellowship]] from [[Carnegie Observatories]] in 1945 because the job required observing at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]], which was reserved for men only at that time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rubin|first=Vera C.|title=Bright Galaxies, Dark Matters|date=1997|publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]]|location=Woodbury, N.Y.|isbn=1-56396-231-4}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/publications/times/TimesV15n4.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414172039/http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/publications/times/TimesV15n4.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2005-04-14|title=UCSD Times: Vol. 15, No. 4, Feb. 1\u201328, 2001|date=2005-04-14|access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref> Shortly after the war, she taught astronomy at ULO to undergraduate students from across the [[University of London]] system, including [[Arthur C. Clarke]] who was then an undergraduate at [[Kings College London]].<ref name=snt/>\n\nIn 1951 she took a position at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Yerkes Observatory]], Wisconsin, her first job in the United States. Her research during this period focused on the abundances of [[chemical elements]] in stars. She returned to the UK in 1953, when Margaret and her husband [[Geoffrey Burbidge]] were invited to work with [[William Alfred Fowler]] and [[Fred Hoyle]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=snt/> The team combined data on elemental abundances produced by the Burbidges with Hoyle's hypothesis that all chemical elements might be produced in stars by a series of nuclear reactions, and Fowler's laboratory experiments on those reactions.<ref name=snt/> The idea became known as [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. They published their model in a series of papers, culminating in a [[magnum opus]] in 1957, now known as the [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]] after the initials of Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler & Hoyle. Margaret Burbidge was the [[first author]] of the paper, which was written while she was pregnant.<ref name=snt/><ref name=rubin_science>{{cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Vera C.|authorlink=Vera Rubin|title=E.

Fowler was later awarded the 1983 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] (shared with [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]]) for his work on nucleosynthesis, and expressed surprise that Burbidge was not included.<ref name=snt/>\n\nWhen Fowler moved back to the US, he advised the Burbidges to come with him to California, suggesting Margaret (the observer) should re-apply for the fellowship at Mount Wilson Observatory while Geoff (the theorist) should seek the Kellogg Fellowship at [[Caltech]].<ref name=rubin_science/> Margaret's application was again refused on gender grounds, so the couple swapped applications. Geoff won the position at Mount Wilson, while Margaret took the Caltech job in 1955. Whenever Geoff was required to go observing on Mount Wilson, Margaret would accompany him, ostensibly as his assistant.<ref name=rubin_science/> In reality, Geoff worked in the [[photographic dark room]] while Margaret operated the telescope.<ref name=snt/> When the observatory's management found out, they eventually agreed that she could observe there, but only if she and her husband stayed in a separate self-catered cottage on the grounds, rather than the catered dormitory which had been designed for men only.<ref name=nyt/>\n\nShe joined the [[University of California San Diego]] (UCSD) in 1962.

When the [[Aberdeen Railway]] opened in 1850, the coastal settlements north of [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] were not linked in, and local interests promoted a branch line from Montrose to [[Bervie]]. They found it impossible to raise capital at first, but from 1861 the larger railways were promoting new connections around [[Aberdeen]], and the [[Great North of Scotland Railway]] (GNoSR) decided that the Bervie line would give it a route to the south.\n\nThat scheme did not proceed, but the GNoSR had put money in, and the simple branch line opened, in 1865.\n\nIt was absorbed by the [[North British Railway]] in 1881, who also thought it might give them a springboard towards Aberdeen; that scheme too failed to materialise, and the line remained a quiet backwater.\n\nRoad transport spelt doom for the sparsely trafficked line, and it closed in 1951.\n\n==History==\n\n===The first railway to Montrose===\nIn 1848, the [[Aberdeen Railway]] opened its line from Guthrie, between Arbroath and Forfar, to Montrose; a shortage of capital delayed its extension to Aberdeen for a while, but after some difficulty it opened to Ferryhill in 1850. The main line ran inland, however, and Montrose was at the end of a stub branch. The coastal communities further north saw the benefits of a railway connection to other villages, and they pressed the Aberdeen Railway, and its successor the [[Scottish North Eastern Railway]] (SNER), to build a branch northwards along the coast.\n\n===An independent concern===\nThese approaches were unsuccessful and the larger companies had other priorities. At length the local people promoted their own branch line, and they obtained their authorising Act of Parliament for the ''Montrose and Bervie Railway'' on 3 July 1860. The line was to be 12&nbsp;miles (19&nbsp;km) long and authorised capital was \u00a370,000.{{sfn|Carter|1959|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Simms|1985|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe Act ''authorised'' the capital but the company had to raise the money themselves, and this proved extremely difficult. In fact two years of strenuous attempts to secure subscriptions were almost completely fruitless, and it appeared likely that the scheme would have to be abandoned.\n\n[[File:Bervie rly & snjr.gif|thumb|The Great North of Scotland Railway plan to use the Bervie line]]However in 1861 a new main line railway was floated, the ''Scottish Northern Junction Railway'', which would connect Kintore, on the [[Great North of Scotland Railway]] (GNoSR) line near Inverurie, with the SNER at Limpet Mill near Stonehaven. It had been a sore point for several years that the GNoSR and the SNER had no through connection at Aberdeen, the GNoSR being content to transfer southwards goods to coastal shipping at Aberdeen; at a stroke a highly useful through line would be created, taking away substantial income from the GNoSR.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|pages=146\u2013154}}\n\n===Funded by the GNoSR===\nThe GNoSR was alarmed by this development, but it saw that if the Montrose and Bervie line were built, it could build extensions northwards and southwards to link Stonehaven and Arbroath; if it could secure running powers over the SNER as well, it would have access from its network to Dundee. The GNoSR bought up substantial blocks of M&BR shares, and a revised route had to be surveyed, converting the planned coastal branch line to a main line, with better gradients, easier curves, and a location at Bervie from which the line could run northwards.\n\nA Bill was presented to Parliament for the 1863 session, with the north and south extensions included: together they were longer than the original route. Disaster befell the company in Parliament, for the scheme was thrown out.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|pages=146\u2013154}}{{sfn|Thomas|Turnock|1989|pages=167 and 168}}\n\n===A local line after all===\n[[File:Bervie rly 1869.gif|thumb|The Montrose and Bervie Railway as built]]Naturally the GNoSR lost interest in the little backwater railway so far from its own network; but now the line had some share capital and the original Act of Parliament, and it set about constructing the line as originally intended. By the summer of 1865 the line was nearing completion, and enquiries were made of [[R and W Hawthorn]], who had purchased the Leith Engine Works, for a locomotive for their line, but the price must have been discouraging. The Company asked the GNoSR to work the line, but this was refused, and finally the SNER worked the line. It opened on 1 November 1865. The trains used the SNER station at Montrose, joining the SNER at Broomfield Junction. (The [[Caledonian Railway]] absorbed the SNER in 1866 and took over the working.){{sfn|Simms|1985|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Ross|2014a|pages=93 and 152}}\n\nIn the first nine months of operation an operating surplus of \u00a3152 was achieved, but this was without allowing for the toll charge for the use of the Montrose station and approach railway. At over \u00a3330 for six months alone, this turned the figures into a major loss. The Company asked the Caledonian to reduce the charge, but when this was declined, the Bervie Company established a station at Broomfield Road, just on its side of the junction, and terminated its trains there. It arranged road cartage to and from Montrose.{{sfn|Smith|Anderson|1997}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThis seems to have motivated compromise in the Caledonian, and a reduced toll charge of \u00a3150 annually was agreed; trains resumed running to Montrose (Caledonian Railway) from 8 August 1866. The Bervie directors undertook to close the Broomfield station permanently, which they did from 1 February 1867.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|pages=146\u2013154}}{{sfn|Thomas|Turnock|1989|pages=167 and 168}}\n\n===Now sponsored by the North British Railway===\n[[File:Bervie rly & nbr.gif|thumb|The North British Railway plan to use the Bervie Railway]]The line had nearly become part of a GNoSR trunk route in 1863, and now another suitor appeared. The [[North British Railway]] (NBR) was operating a rather disjointed service between Edinburgh and Aberdeen by ferries across the [[Firth of Forth]] and [[Firth of Tay]], and then over the Caledonian Railway via Arbroath and Stonehaven. Parliament had granted the NBR running powers over large parts of the northern section of the Caledonian Railway, in order to encourage competition. Nonetheless, this dependency on a competitor was hardly a satisfactory arrangement, and the NBR aspired to establish a route controlled by itself. Bridging the Forth and Tay was feasible, although expensive. Getting from Dundee to Arbroath would be done over the [[Dundee and Arbroath Railway]] which was to be operated jointly. A new NBR line from Arbroath to near Stonehaven could use the Montrose and Bervie line, saving construction costs.\n\nThe Caledonian had a contract with the M&BR to work the line until 1873, and fearing the NBR incursion, negotiated to extend that for a further eight years, frustrating the NBR plans.{{sfn|Simms|1985|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe Bervie line was utterly impoverished, and yet this scheme was received coldly by many local interests, who preferred retaining independence, but these reservations were overcome and the Montrose and Bervie Railway was absorbed by the North British Railway on 1 October 1881.{{sfn|Carter|1959|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}} (This was originally intended to be 1 August; the NBR paid 65% of the face value of M&BR stock and assumed the company's mortgage debt of \u00a318,000.{{sfn|Ross|2014b|pages=90, 91 and 120}} The Caledonian Railway was permitted to retain running powers. The Bervie line trains now ran to the NBR station at Montrose.\n\nThe NBR had sponsored a nominally independent line from Arbroath to Montrose (the [[North British, Arbroath and Montrose Railway]]), which obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 13 July 1871, capital \u00a3171,580. There was some delay in construction, but it opened to goods traffic in 1881, and to passengers in 1883.{{sfn|Carter|1959|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Ross|2014b|pages=90, 91 and 120}} It had its own station at Montrose, and joined the Caledonian main line at Kinnaber Junction, a few miles north of Montrose. However, the development of the Bervie line, and the new construction at its north end onward to Stonehaven, never took place.\n\nWhen the North British, Arbroath and Montrose Railway opened its line, a spur was provided (authorised by an Act of 1872{{sfn|Simms|1985|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}) connecting that company's main line at Montrose North Junction (immediately north of Montrose NBR station) to Broomfield Road Junction, giving access to the Bervie line.{{sfn|Smith|Anderson|1997}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nFrom 2 August 1897 the Caledonian Railway started operating its own train services on the Bervie line, exercising the running powers already granted. This was hardly a commercial move, and was simply in retaliation for an imagined act of bad faith elsewhere by the NBR. Passengers on the line therefore had CR trains to the CR Montrose station and NBR trains to the NBR station. There was simply not enough traffic on the line to sustain this, and Caledonian trains stopped running from 1 October 1898. However, there were local protests at this, and Caledonian goods services quickly resumed (on 17 October), but were finally discontinued from June 1899.{{sfn|Simms|1985|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|pages=146\u2013154}}{{sfn|Ross|2014a|pages=93 and 152}}\n\nThe line was now simply a remote coastal branch line of the North British Railway.\n\n===The twentieth century===\nIn 1913 the [[Royal Flying Corps]] established its first operational airfield at Broomfield Farm, adjacent to the Bervie line immediately north of Broomfield Junction. On the formation of the [[Royal Air Force]] the location became [[RAF Montrose]]. The site was used for military purposes almost continuously until closure in 1952. There was a short siding, named \"Aerodrome Siding\" facing from the Bervie direction at the north end of the site at Wardhouse Road. During [[World War II]] an aircraft approaching struck and demolished part of Broomfield Junction signal box.{{sfn|Smith|Anderson|1997}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = os>Ordance Survey Maps, 1924 (1:2,500) and 1928 (1:10,560)</ref>\n\nIn 1923 the North British Railway was a constituent of the new [[London and North Eastern Railway]], following the grouping of the railways of Great Britain under the [[Railways Act 1921]]. The Caledonian Railway was a constituent of the [[London Midland and Scottish Railway]].\n\nBy 1951 road passenger and goods services in the area had become dominant, and the line was closed to passengers.

The track then curved round the back of Gourdon village and continued along the coast to a terminus close to Bervie Bay.

The line was to be 12&nbsp;miles (19&nbsp;km) long and authorised capital was \u00a370,000.{{sfn|Carter|1959|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Simms|1985|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe Act ''authorised'' the capital but the company had to raise the money themselves, and this proved extremely difficult. In fact two years of strenuous attempts to secure subscriptions were almost completely fruitless, and it appeared likely that the scheme would have to be abandoned.\n\n[[File:Bervie rly & snjr.gif|thumb|The Great North of Scotland Railway plan to use the Bervie line]]However in 1861 a new main line railway was floated, the ''Scottish Northern Junction Railway'', which would connect Kintore, on the [[Great North of Scotland Railway]] (GNoSR) line near Inverurie, with the SNER at Limpet Mill near Stonehaven. It had been a sore point for several years that the GNoSR and the SNER had no through connection at Aberdeen, the GNoSR being content to transfer southwards goods to coastal shipping at Aberdeen; at a stroke a highly useful through line would be created, taking away substantial income from the GNoSR.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|pages=146\u2013154}}\n\n===Funded by the GNoSR===\nThe GNoSR was alarmed by this development, but it saw that if the Montrose and Bervie line were built, it could build extensions northwards and southwards to link Stonehaven and Arbroath; if it could secure running powers over the SNER as well, it would have access from its network to Dundee. The GNoSR bought up substantial blocks of M&BR shares, and a revised route had to be surveyed, converting the planned coastal branch line to a main line, with better gradients, easier curves, and a location at Bervie from which the line could run northwards.\n\nA Bill was presented to Parliament for the 1863 session, with the north and south extensions included: together they were longer than the original route. Disaster befell the company in Parliament, for the scheme was thrown out.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|pages=146\u2013154}}{{sfn|Thomas|Turnock|1989|pages=167 and 168}}\n\n===A local line after all===\n[[File:Bervie rly 1869.gif|thumb|The Montrose and Bervie Railway as built]]Naturally the GNoSR lost interest in the little backwater railway so far from its own network; but now the line had some share capital and the original Act of Parliament, and it set about constructing the line as originally intended. By the summer of 1865 the line was nearing completion, and enquiries were made of [[R and W Hawthorn]], who had purchased the Leith Engine Works, for a locomotive for their line, but the price must have been discouraging. The Company asked the GNoSR to work the line, but this was refused, and finally the SNER worked the line. It opened on 1 November 1865. The trains used the SNER station at Montrose, joining the SNER at Broomfield Junction. (The [[Caledonian Railway]] absorbed the SNER in 1866 and took over the working.){{sfn|Simms|1985|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Ross|2014a|pages=93 and 152}}\n\nIn the first nine months of operation an operating surplus of \u00a3152 was achieved, but this was without allowing for the toll charge for the use of the Montrose station and approach railway. At over \u00a3330 for six months alone, this turned the figures into a major loss. The Company asked the Caledonian to reduce the charge, but when this was declined, the Bervie Company established a station at Broomfield Road, just on its side of the junction, and terminated its trains there. It arranged road cartage to and from Montrose.{{sfn|Smith|Anderson|1997}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThis seems to have motivated compromise in the Caledonian, and a reduced toll charge of \u00a3150 annually was agreed; trains resumed running to Montrose (Caledonian Railway) from 8 August 1866. The Bervie directors undertook to close the Broomfield station permanently, which they did from 1 February 1867.{{sfn|Thomas|1976|pages=146\u2013154}}{{sfn|Thomas|Turnock|1989|pages=167 and 168}}\n\n===Now sponsored by the North British Railway===\n[[File:Bervie rly & nbr.gif|thumb|The North British Railway plan to use the Bervie Railway]]The line had nearly become part of a GNoSR trunk route in 1863, and now another suitor appeared. The [[North British Railway]] (NBR) was operating a rather disjointed service between Edinburgh and Aberdeen by ferries across the [[Firth of Forth]] and [[Firth of Tay]], and then over the Caledonian Railway via Arbroath and Stonehaven. Parliament had granted the NBR running powers over large parts of the northern section of the Caledonian Railway, in order to encourage competition. Nonetheless, this dependency on a competitor was hardly a satisfactory arrangement, and the NBR aspired to establish a route controlled by itself. Bridging the Forth and Tay was feasible, although expensive. Getting from Dundee to Arbroath would be done over the [[Dundee and Arbroath Railway]] which was to be operated jointly. A new NBR line from Arbroath to near Stonehaven could use the Montrose and Bervie line, saving construction costs.\n\nThe Caledonian had a contract with the M&BR to work the line until 1873, and fearing the NBR incursion, negotiated to extend that for a further eight years, frustrating the NBR plans.{{sfn|Simms|1985|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThe Bervie line was utterly impoverished, and yet this scheme was received coldly by many local interests, who preferred retaining independence, but these reservations were overcome and the Montrose and Bervie Railway was absorbed by the North British Railway on 1 October 1881.{{sfn|Carter|1959|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}} (This was originally intended to be 1 August; the NBR paid 65% of the face value of M&BR stock and assumed the company's mortgage debt of \u00a318,000.{{sfn|Ross|2014b|pages=90, 91 and 120}} The Caledonian Railway was permitted to retain running powers. The Bervie line trains now ran to the NBR station at Montrose.\n\nThe NBR had sponsored a nominally independent line from Arbroath to Montrose (the [[North British, Arbroath and Montrose Railway]]), which obtained its authorising Act of Parliament on 13 July 1871, capital \u00a3171,580. There was some delay in construction, but it opened to goods traffic in 1881, and to passengers in 1883.{{sfn|Carter|1959|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Ross|2014b|pages=90, 91 and 120}} It had its own station at Montrose, and joined the Caledonian main line at Kinnaber Junction, a few miles north of Montrose. However, the development of the Bervie line, and the new construction at its north end onward to Stonehaven, never took place.\n\nWhen the North British, Arbroath and Montrose Railway opened its line, a spur was provided (authorised by an Act of 1872{{sfn|Simms|1985|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}) connecting that company's main line at Montrose North Junction (immediately north of Montrose NBR station) to Broomfield Road Junction, giving access to the Bervie line.{{sfn|Smith|Anderson|1997}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nFrom 2 August 1897 the Caledonian Railway started operating its own train services on the Bervie line, exercising the running powers already granted. This was hardly a commercial move, and was simply in retaliation for an imagined act of bad faith elsewhere by the NBR. Passengers on the line therefore had CR trains to the CR Montrose station and NBR trains to the NBR station. There was simply not enough traffic on the line to sustain this, and Caledonian trains stopped running from 1 October 1898. However, there were local protests at this, and Caledonian goods services quickly resumed (on 17 October), but were finally discontinued from June 1899.{{sfn|Simms|1985|p=}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}{{sfn|Thomas|1976|pages=146\u2013154}}{{sfn|Ross|2014a|pages=93 and 152}}\n\nThe line was now simply a remote coastal branch line of the North British Railway.\n\n===The twentieth century===\nIn 1913 the [[Royal Flying Corps]] established its first operational airfield at Broomfield Farm, adjacent to the Bervie line immediately north of Broomfield Junction. On the formation of the [[Royal Air Force]] the location became [[RAF Montrose]]. The site was used for military purposes almost continuously until closure in 1952. There was a short siding, named \"Aerodrome Siding\" facing from the Bervie direction at the north end of the site at Wardhouse Road. During [[World War II]] an aircraft approaching struck and demolished part of Broomfield Junction signal box.{{sfn|Smith|Anderson|1997}}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}<ref name = os>Ordance Survey Maps, 1924 (1:2,500) and 1928 (1:10,560)</ref>\n\nIn 1923 the North British Railway was a constituent of the new [[London and North Eastern Railway]], following the grouping of the railways of Great Britain under the [[Railways Act 1921]].

It was a marital psychodrama, ''Swapnadanam'' rejected all the usual song-dance numbers of popular cinema, yet succeeded in reaching the common mass. Later he turned to the middle-stream cinema and produced some of the best works of Malayalam cinema, which became highly popular with the masses. It was a commercial success as well as critically acclaimed and won several awards. ''Swapnadanam'' won the [[Kerala State Film Award]] for best film. His another movie released in 1980, ''[[Kolangal (1981 film)|Kolangal]]'' smithereens the common romantic concept about an interior village of Kerala filled with virtues and happiness. Here a village is shown in the clutches of wildfire of jealousy. ''[[Yavanika]]'' stands out as one of the most commercially successful, yet artistically superior films of the 1980s. In the form of a detective thriller, ''Yavanika'' explores backstage drama of a travelling drama troop. It won the [[Kerala State Film Award for Best Film]]. K. G. George uses the cinema within cinema technique for this film. With hints to the real life incident of suicide of popular actress Shobha, ''[[Lekhayude Maranam Oru Flashback]] '' became controversial even before its release. He used a new narrative technique ''[[Adaminte Variyellu]]'', by telling the story of unhappy marital lives and oppressions suffered by three urban women. Based on short story by [[Veloor Krishnankutty]], George's ''[[Panchavadi Palam]] '' is a satirical comedy with intentionally exaggerated story line and caricature-like characters. It works almost as a political cartoon. ''[[Irakal]]'' is an in-depth exploration of the psychology of violence. A ruthless rubber baron, Mathukutty, disregards the prevailing moral standards and spawns criminal sons as well as a sexually wayward daughter, Annie. His son, Baby is a psychotic strangler who uses a nylon wire and is eventually shot dead by his repentant father.\n\nGeorge's last movie was released in 1998, ''[[Elavamkodu Desam]]'', a period movie released when mimicry movies ruled the roost. \"The audience somehow did not relate to this movie,\" he says sadly.

In the main southern part of its range, it is found in an area bounded by Jarrahdale and [[Wooroloo, Western Australia|Woorooloo]] on or east of the Darling Scarp, and south-east to Beaufort Inlet. Here it occurs in tall forest dominated by karri (''[[Eucalyptus diversicolor]]''), where it is found in dense undergrowth of such plant species as karri hazel (''[[Trymalium odoratissimum]]'' subsp. ''trifidum''), karri she\u2013oak (''[[Allocasuarina decussata]]''), and nedik (''[[Bossiaea aquifolium]]''), typically along rivers and gullies. It also inhabits dry [[sclerophyll]] forest of karri, jarrah (''[[Eucalyptus marginata]]''), and bull banksia (''[[Banksia grandis]]''), where it lives in the 2-3 m high [[understory]]. The northern population is found along a narrow band from Geraldton south to [[Yanchep National Park]], where it lives in coastal thickets\u2014often covered in dodder\u2014of ''[[Acacia rostellifera]]'', ''[[Acacia cyclops]]'', ''[[Melaleuca cardiophylla]]'' growing over sand dunes on limestone soils.

It is sedentary, with pairs or small groups maintaining territories.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe white-breasted robin was first described by the [[France|French]] [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830, as ''Muscicapa georgiana'',<ref>{{ cite book | last1=Quoy | first1=Jean | author1-link=Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy | last2=Gaimard | first2=Joseph Paul | author2-link=Joseph Paul Gaimard | editor-last=Dumont d'Urville | editor-first=Jules | editor-link=Jules Dumont d'Urville | year=1830 | title=Voyage de la corvette l'Astrolabe : ex\u00e9cut\u00e9 par ordre du roi, pendant les ann\u00e9es 1826-1827-1828-1829: Zoologie | volume=Volume 1 | language=French |  location=Paris | publisher=J.

Within this area it is mainly restricted to two areas of different habitat. In the main southern part of its range, it is found in an area bounded by Jarrahdale and [[Wooroloo, Western Australia|Woorooloo]] on or east of the Darling Scarp, and south-east to Beaufort Inlet. Here it occurs in tall forest dominated by karri (''[[Eucalyptus diversicolor]]''), where it is found in dense undergrowth of such plant species as karri hazel (''[[Trymalium odoratissimum]]'' subsp. ''trifidum''), karri she\u2013oak (''[[Allocasuarina decussata]]'') and nedik (''[[Bossiaea aquifolium]]''), typically along rivers and gullies. It also inhabits dry [[sclerophyll]] forest of karri, jarrah (''[[Eucalyptus marginata]]'') and bull banksia (''[[Banksia grandis]]''), where it lives in the 2-3 m high [[understory]]. The northern population is found along a narrow band from Geraldton south to [[Yanchep National Park]], where it lives in coastal thickets\u2014often covered in dodder\u2014of ''[[Acacia rostellifera]]'', ''[[Acacia cyclops]]'', ''[[Melaleuca cardiophylla]]'' over sand dunes on limestone soils. It is sedentary, with pairs or small groups maintaining territories in its range. Young male birds remain around their parents' territories as helper birds for around a year while females disperse.{{sfn|Higgins|2002|p=799}}<!-- cites paragraph -->\n\n==Behaviour==\n[[File:Eopsaltria georgiana -Northcliff, Western Australia, Australia -nest-8.jpg|right|thumb|Nesting in Western Australia]]\nThe white-breasted robin is a cooperative breeder; breeding pairs are often assisted by one or more [[Helpers at the nest|helper]] birds who help raise young.<ref name=\"Russ04\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Russell EM, Brown RJ, Brown MN |year=2004|title=Life history of the white-breasted robin, ''Eopsaltria georgiana'' (Petroicidae), in south-western Australia |journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=111\u201345|doi=10.1071/ZO03049 }}</ref> Helper birds are mostly male; female birds are more likely to leave the territory in the first year of their life, while males are more likely to remain.<ref name=\"Russ04\"/>\n\n===Breeding===\nBreeding season is late winter to early summer with up to two broods raised.
