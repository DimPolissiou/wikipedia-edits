Rocks drinks are typically served in a [[rocks glass]], [[highball glass]], or [[Collins glass]], all of which refer to a relatively straight-walled, flat-bottomed glass; the rocks glass is typically the shortest and widest, followed by the highball which is taller and often narrower, then the Collins which is taller and narrower still.\n\n===Garnish===\n\"With a twist\" signals the bartender to add a \"[[Twist (cocktail garnish)|twist]]\" of the [[Zest_(ingredient)|zest]] of a [[citrus]] fruit (bar choice, if unspecified) to the cocktail. Often, the bartender will hang the rind of the citrus on the glass as a [[Cocktail garnish|garnish]] (see [[#martini|martini photo]] above).\n\n=== Details ===\n[[Cocktail]]s are generally served chilled, although some (e.g., [[margarita]]s) may be served either with or without ice, and this must be specified. Cocktails can be served \"frozen\", which is with crushed ice instead of cubes.\n \nUnmixed liquors may be served either neat, up, or on the rocks, with differing conventions. High-quality [[whisky]] and other aged liquor are most often served neat, while lower-quality whisky is usually served with a mixer or on the rocks. [[Vodka]] can be stored as a liquid well below the freezing point of water because of its high proof and low particulate content, and cocktails made with sub-freezing vodka are sometimes requested to minimize the amount of added water from melted ice during shaking.\n\n===Chaser===\n{{Wiktionary|chaser}}\nA shot of whisky, [[tequila]], or vodka, when served neat in a shot glass,  is often accompanied by a \"chaser\" (a mild drink consumed after a shot of [[hard liquor]]) or a \"water back\" (a separate glass of water). These terms commingle as well; it is common in many locales to hear a \"beer back\" ordered as the chaser to a shot. A drink may specifically be ordered \"no chaser\" as well.\n\nA \"chaser\" in the UK however usually refers to a shot taken after a pint of beer or similar.\n\n==Well and top-shelf==\nDrinks establishments will often have a lower-priced category of drinks, known as \"[[well drink]]s\" or \"rail drinks\", and a higher-priced category known as \"top-shelf\" or \"call\" drinks, and will use [[upselling]] by offering the higher-priced category when taking orders. The terms come from the relative positions of the bottles of spirit used for the drinks; the cheapest version of a spirit offered by a bar is typically stored in a long rail or \"well\" making it readily available to a busy bartender, while the more expensive, better-quality liqueurs and spirits are displayed on shelves behind the bar where they attract patrons to the available selection.\n\n==Sizes==\n{{Further|shot glass}}\nA \"[[Pony (disambiguation)#Fluid volume|pony]]\" is slang for {{convert|1|USoz|spell=in}} of spirit, while the standard-size \"shot\" of alcohol is a {{convert|1.5|USoz|adj=on}} \"jigger\", with a \"double\" being {{convert|3|USoz|spell=in}}.\n\nRather than use measuring equipment, professional bartenders usually use a pour spout inserted into the mouth of the bottle, which restricts the flow of liquid to a standard rate allowing reasonably accurate time-based pours. For instance, a \"6-count\" is a common analogue for a 1.5oz jigger, which can be trained to by having the bartender upend the bottle (with pour spout installed) and counting to 6 out loud as quickly as the words can be said clearly. This method breaks down into convenient sub-measures; each count is approximately one-quarter fluid ounce, making a \"pony\" 4 counts and a \"half-jigger\" 3 counts.

United States federal law defines the term \"[[straight whiskey]]\" as whiskey that has met particular requirements for its ingredients, production process, and aging.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/aprqtr/pdf/27cfr5.22.pdf | title = Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, Title 27 Code of Federal Regulations, Pt. 5.22(b)(1)(iii) | accessdate = 2019-08-03 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081217025920/http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/aprqtr/pdf/27cfr5.22.pdf | archive-date = 2008-12-17 | url-status = dead }}</ref> For example, the label of a bottle of [[top-shelf liquor|top-shelf]] [[Bourbon Whiskey|bourbon]] typically identifies the product as \"Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey\" (since about 95% of all bourbon is produced in [[Kentucky]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://kybourbon.com/bourbon_culture-2/key_bourbon_facts/ |title=Bourbon Facts |publisher=Kentucky Distillers' Association |access-date=2019-08-03}}</ref>\n\nWhile the meaning of \"up\" and \"neat\" is ordinarily clear, some clarification may be needed for \"straight\" and \"straight up\", to determine whether the spirit is intended to be chilled and strained or served undiluted at room temperature.<ref name=\"morgen\" />\n\n===Neat===\n{{wiktionary|neat}}\nA drink served \"neat\" is a single, unmixed [[Distilled beverage|liquor]] served without being chilled and without any water, ice, or other [[Drink mixer|mixer]].<ref name=Manual /><ref name=\"morgen\">\"[http://www.jeffreymorgenthaler.com/2008/up-neat-straight-up-or-on-the-rocks/ Up, Neat, Straight Up, or On the Rocks]\", Jeffrey Morgenthaler, Friday, May 9, 2008</ref> Neat drinks are typically served in a [[rocks glass]], [[shot glass]], [[snifter]], [[Glencairn whisky glass|Glencairn]] glass, or [[copita]].\n\n=== On the rocks===\n{{wiktionary|on the rocks}}\n[[File:Negroni served in Vancouver BC.jpg|thumb|left|A [[negroni]] cocktail with an orange [[Twist (cocktail garnish)|twist]] served on the rocks]]\n\"On the rocks\" refers to liquor poured over ice cubes, and a \"rocks drink\" is a drink served on the rocks. Rocks drinks are typically served in a [[rocks glass]], [[highball glass]], or [[Collins glass]], all of which refer to a relatively straight-walled, flat-bottomed glass; the rocks glass is typically the shortest and widest, followed by the highball which is taller and often narrower, then the Collins which is taller and narrower still.\n\n===Garnish===\n\"With a twist\" signals the bartender to add a \"[[Twist (cocktail garnish)|twist]]\" of the [[Zest_(ingredient)|zest]] of a [[citrus]] fruit (bar choice, if unspecified) to the cocktail. Often, the bartender will hang the rind of the citrus on the glass as a [[Cocktail garnish|garnish]] (see [[#martini|martini photo]] above).\n\n=== Details ===\n[[Cocktail]]s are generally served chilled, although some (e.g., [[margarita]]s) may be served either with or without ice, and this must be specified. Cocktails can be served \"frozen\", which is with crushed ice instead of cubes.\n \nUnmixed liquors may be served either neat, up, or on the rocks, with differing conventions. High-quality [[whisky]] and other aged liquor are most often served neat, while lower-quality whisky is usually served with a mixer or on the rocks. [[Vodka]] can be stored as a liquid well below the freezing point of water because of its high proof and low particulate content, and cocktails made with sub-freezing vodka are sometimes requested to minimize the amount of added water from melted ice during shaking.\n\n===Chaser===\n{{Wiktionary|chaser}}\nA shot of whisky, [[tequila]], or vodka, when served neat in a shot glass,  is often accompanied by a \"chaser\" (a mild drink consumed after a shot of [[hard liquor]]) or a \"water back\" (a separate glass of water). These terms commingle as well; it is common in many locales to hear a \"beer back\" ordered as the chaser to a shot. A drink may specifically be ordered \"no chaser\" as well.\n\nA \"chaser\" in the UK however usually refers to a shot taken after a pint of beer or similar.\n\n==Well and top-shelf==\nDrinks establishments will often have a lower-priced category of drinks, known as \"[[well drink]]s\" or \"rail drinks\", and a higher-priced category known as \"top-shelf\" or \"call\" drinks, and will use [[upselling]] by offering the higher-priced category when taking orders. The terms come from the relative positions of the bottles of spirit used for the drinks; the cheapest version of a spirit offered by a bar is typically stored in a long rail or \"well\" making it readily available to a busy bartender, while the more expensive, better-quality liqueurs and spirits are displayed on shelves behind the bar where they attract patrons to the available selection.\n\n==Sizes==\n{{Further|shot glass}}\nA \"[[Pony (disambiguation)#Fluid volume|pony]]\" is slang for {{convert|1|USoz|spell=in}} of spirit, while the standard-size \"shot\" of alcohol is a {{convert|1.5|USoz|adj=on}} \"jigger\", with a \"double\" being {{convert|3|USoz|spell=in}}.\n\nRather than use measuring equipment, professional bartenders usually use a pour spout inserted into the mouth of the bottle, which restricts the flow of liquid to a standard rate allowing reasonably accurate time-based pours. For instance, a \"6-count\" is a common analogue for a 1.5oz jigger, which can be trained to by having the bartender upend the bottle (with pour spout installed) and counting to 6 out loud as quickly as the words can be said clearly. This method breaks down into convenient sub-measures; each count is approximately one-quarter fluid ounce, making a \"pony\" 4 counts and a \"half-jigger\" 3 counts. This system is not perfect because liquids of different [[viscosity|viscosities]] will pour at different rates through the same spout, but it does allow consistent pours from drink to drink for a consistent result from each bartender, while being much faster than using a thimble measure or similar [[Alcoholic spirits measure|spirit measure]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Drink|Liquor}}\n*[[Distilled beverage#Serving|Distilled beverage]]\n*[[List of cocktails]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Bartend}}\n\n[[Category:Drinking culture]]\n[[Category:Bartending]]\n", "name_user": "97.118.79.113", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Left comment)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartending_terminology"}

In 1875, he was selected by the [[Ministry of Education (Japan)|Ministry of Education]] as one of the first students to study abroad under a government scholarship. While at [[Harvard University]], Komura shared lodgings with fellow Japanese student [[Kaneko Kentar\u014d]].

His tenure as Foreign Minister was marked with increasing tension between Japan and Russia over Korea and Manchuria, cumulating in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905.\n\n[[Image:Treaty of Portsmouth.jpg|thumb|right|Negotiating the Treaty of Portsmouth (1905) \u2013 from left to right: the Russians at far side of table are Korostovetz, Nabokov, [[Sergei Witte|Witte]], [[Roman Rosen|Rosen]], Plancon; and the Japanese at near side of table are [[Mineichir\u014d Adachi|Adachi]], [[Ochiai Kentaro|Ochiai]], Komura, [[Takahira Kogoro|Takahira]], [[Aimaro Sat\u014d|Sat\u014d]].

On his return to Tokyo, he resumed the post of Foreign Minister in the 2nd Katsura administration, signing the [[Root\u2013Takahira Agreement]] with the United States. His peerage title was also elevated to that of [[Count]] (\"hakushaku\") in 1907.\n\nKomura also played a key role in the [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty]] in 1910, and in concluding various international agreements in 1911 to restore Japan's tariff autonomy. He was elevated to the title of [[Marquis]] (\"koshaku\") on April 21, 1911.\n\nSuffering from [[tuberculosis]] in his final years, Komura moved to the seaside resort of [[Hayama, Kanagawa|Hayama]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]; however, he died of the disease on November 26, 1911.

As a result, he wore the same frayed [[frock coat]] for years, regardless of season or occasion.

He attended the ''Daigaku Nank\u014d'' (the predecessor of [[Tokyo Imperial University]]). In 1875, he was selected by the [[Ministry of Education (Japan)|Ministry of Education]] as one of the first students to study abroad under a government scholarship. While at [[Harvard University]], Komura shared lodgings with fellow Japanese student [[Kaneko Kentar\u014d]]. In due course, Komura graduated from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1878.\n\n==Career of government service==\n\n[[File:Komura Jutaro.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Komura Jutar\u014d]]\n\nIn 1880, Komura joined the [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]] and after serving as a judge of the [[Supreme Court of Japan|Supreme Court]], in 1884 transferred to the Translation Bureau in the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Japan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].\n\n[[File:\u300a\u8f9b\u4e11\u6761\u7ea6\u300b\u7b7e\u5b57\u65f6\u7684\u60c5\u666f.jpg|thumb|Signing of the Boxer Protocol.

His tenure as Foreign Minister was marked with increasing tension between Japan and Russia over Korea and Manchuria, cumulating in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904\u20131905.\n\n[[Image:Treaty of Portsmouth.jpg|thumb|right|Negotiating the Treaty of Portsmouth (1905) \u2013 from left to right: the Russians at far side of table are Korostovetz, Nabokov, [[Sergei Witte|Witte]], [[Roman Rosen|Rosen]], Plancon; and the Japanese at near side of table are [[Mineichir\u014d Adachi|Adachi]], [[Ochiai Kentaro|Ochiai]], Komura, [[Takahira Kogoro|Takahira]], [[Aimaro Sat\u014d|Sat\u014d]].

Harriman]], the American railway magnate, to propose a joint venture between his conglomerate and Japan towards the development of the [[South Manchuria Railway]]. On his return to Japan, he found that the agreement was opposed by the [[genr\u014d]], and was not implemented.\n\nKomura also met with Chinese representatives in Beijing, signing the [[Peking Treaty]] of December 1905, which transferred former Russian rights in southern Manchuria to Japan.\n\nFor these services, Komura was awarded the [[Order of the Paulownia Flowers]] in 1906, and was appointed to become a member of the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]].\n\nFrom June 1906 to August 1908, Komura served as ambassador to Great Britain, during which time he was made a [[K.C.B.]] by King [[Edward VII]] and made a member of the [[Royal Victorian Order]]. On his return to Tokyo, he resumed the post of Foreign Minister in the 2nd Katsura administration, signing the [[Root\u2013Takahira Agreement]] with the United States. His peerage title was also elevated to that of [[Count]] (\"hakushaku\") in 1907.\n\nKomura also played a key role in the [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty]] in 1910, and in concluding various international agreements in 1911 to restore Japan's tariff autonomy. He was elevated to the title of [[Marquis]] (\"koshaku\") on April 21, 1911.\n\nSuffering from [[tuberculosis]] in his final years, Komura moved to the seaside resort of [[Hayama, Kanagawa|Hayama]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]; however, he died of the disease on November 26, 1911. His grave is at [[Aoyama Cemetery]] in Tokyo.\n\n==In popular culture==\nPer [[Ry\u014dtar\u014d Shiba]] in his semi-historical work ''[[Saka no Ue no Kumo]]'', Komura inherited massive debts from his father, which he had difficulty with repayment. As a result, he wore the same frayed [[frock coat]] for years, regardless of season or occasion.

(Eponymous bands are generally not separated; thus [[Charlie Daniels]] is not counted as a one-hit wonder for \"[[Uneasy Rider]]\" and the hits of the [[Charlie Daniels Band]] are credited to him.)\n\n[[Fred Bronson]], a journalist and former writer for ''Billboard'' magazine, in his book ''Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits'', uses the criterion that an artist is ineligible to be categorized as a \"one-hit wonder\" if they have a second song listed on the Billboard Hot 100.{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=219\u201320}}\n\nIn both cases, the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] was used as an objective standard for one-hit wonder status, since ''Billboard'' magazine published the books.\n\nDisc jockey and music writer Brent Mann points out how some artists have been called a \"one-hit wonder\" despite having other charting singles; in these cases, one [[signature song]] so overshadows the rest of the artist's discography that only that song remains familiar to later audiences. As an example, English-born singer [[Albert Hammond]] enjoyed success with \"[[It Never Rains in Southern California]]\" (1972) rising to number 5 in the US, but his follow-up single, \"[[I'm a Train]]\" was dismissed by Mann as \"totally forgotten\" even though it charted at number 31 in 1974.{{sfn|Mann|2003|p=165}} In another case, Scottish rockers [[Simple Minds]] followed their big hit \"[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]\" (appearing in the opening and closing scenes of the film ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'') with \"[[Alive and Kicking (song)|Alive and Kicking]]\" which peaked at number 3 in the US, and \"[[Sanctify Yourself]]\" (''Billboard'' Top 100 number 14), yet the band is remembered primarily for the first song.<ref name=\"Simple Minds\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-one-hit-wonders-2018-5|title=The 57 best one-hit wonders of all time|first=Gabbi|last=Shaw|website=Thisisinsider.com|accessdate=December 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226232753/https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-one-hit-wonders-2018-5|archive-date=December 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, some artists with long, successful careers have been identified as one-hit wonders by virtue of having reached the Top 40 of the Hot 100 only once. ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' editor Matt Melis lists [[Beck]] (\"[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]]\") and the [[Grateful Dead]] (\"[[Touch of Grey]]\") as \"technically\" being one-hit wonders despite their large bodies of work.{{sfn|Melis|2016|p=1}} ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' mentions prolific artist [[Frank Zappa]] as a one-hit wonder because his only Top 40 hit was \"[[Valley Girl (song)|Valley Girl]]\" in 1982.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2009}}\n\nChris Molanphy says that an artist can only be seen as a \"one hit wonder\" if they have never had a second Billboard top 10 hit, if any subsequent top 40 singles were released within six months of their first big hit, and if the artist has not had three or more top 10 or Platinum albums.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226175321/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/09/carly_rae_jepsen_one_hit_wonder.php?page=all|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/09/carly_rae_jepsen_one_hit_wonder.php?page=all|title=100 & Single: Three Rules To Define The Term \"One-Hit Wonder\" In 2012|author=Chris Molanphy|archive-date=February 26, 2013|access-date=August 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/dont_call_them_one_hit_wonders/|title=Don't call them \"one-hit wonders\"|author=Annie Zaleski|access-date=August 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803151256/https://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/dont_call_them_one_hit_wonders/|archive-date=August 3, 2019|url-status=live|date=September 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Multiple appearances==\nBritish musician [[Tony Burrows]] sang the lead vocal on five one-hit wonders: [[Edison Lighthouse]]'s \"[[Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)]]\" (February 1970); [[White Plains (band)|White Plains]]' \"[[My Baby Loves Lovin']]\" (March 1970); [[the Pipkins]]' \"[[Gimme Dat Ding (song)|Gimme Dat Ding]]\" (April 1970); [[the First Class]]' \"[[Beach Baby]]\" (July 1974); and \"[[United We Stand (song)|United We Stand]]\" (1970) by the first incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Man]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-30/entertainment/ca-38886_1_tony-burrows|title=From Bankable Burrows to One-Hit Wonders|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|date=August 30, 1996|accessdate=November 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |title=Rhino Gets Nostalgic With DeFrancos and Turtles in First (We Hope Not Last) Retrofest |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |date=August 28, 1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18 |page=18 |volume=111 |number=35 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\n[[Joey Levine]], American session singer best known for his prolific work in the [[bubblegum pop]] and commercial [[jingle]] genera, who had recorded hits for [[the Ohio Express]] (\"[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]\"), also sang hits for [[The Third Rail (band)|the Third Rail]], the [[Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus]] (\"Quick Joey Small\") and Reunion (\"[[Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)]]\").<ref>Cooper, Kim (April 26, 2006).

artist who is remembered for only one hit despite other successes.{{sfn|Mann|2003|p=165}}{{sfn|Melis|2016|p=1}} This list contains artists known primarily for one hit song in the United States, who are described as one-hit wonders by the media.\n\n==Criteria==\nMusic reviewers and journalists sometimes describe a musical artist as a one-hit wonder, based on their professional assessment of chart success, sales figures and fame.\n\nFor the purpose of his book ''The Billboard Book of One-Hit Wonders'', music journalist Wayne Jancik defines a one-hit wonder as \"an act that has won a position on ''Billboard''{{'}}s national, pop, [[Top 40]] just once.\" In his definition of an \"act\", Jancik distinguishes between a solo performer and any group he or she may have performed in (thus, for example, [[Roger Daltrey]]'s \"[[Without Your Love (Roger Daltrey song)|Without Your Love]]\" is counted despite Daltrey's numerous hits as frontman for [[the Who]]), and a number of musicians appear multiple times, either with multiple bands or as a member of a band and as a solo artist. (Eponymous bands are generally not separated; thus [[Charlie Daniels]] is not counted as a one-hit wonder for \"[[Uneasy Rider]]\" and the hits of the [[Charlie Daniels Band]] are credited to him.)\n\n[[Fred Bronson]], a journalist and former writer for ''Billboard'' magazine, in his book ''Billboard's Hottest Hot 100 Hits'', uses the criterion that an artist is ineligible to be categorized as a \"one-hit wonder\" if they have a second song listed on the Billboard Hot 100.{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=219\u201320}}\n\nIn both cases, the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] was used as an objective standard for one-hit wonder status, since ''Billboard'' magazine published the books.\n\nDisc jockey and music writer Brent Mann points out how some artists have been called a \"one-hit wonder\" despite having other charting singles; in these cases, one [[signature song]] so overshadows the rest of the artist's discography that only that song remains familiar to later audiences. As an example, English-born singer [[Albert Hammond]] enjoyed success with \"[[It Never Rains in Southern California]]\" (1972) rising to number 5 in the US, but his follow-up single, \"[[I'm a Train]]\" was dismissed by Mann as \"totally forgotten\" even though it charted at number 31 in 1974.{{sfn|Mann|2003|p=165}} In another case, Scottish rockers [[Simple Minds]] followed their big hit \"[[Don't You (Forget About Me)]]\" (appearing in the opening and closing scenes of the film ''[[The Breakfast Club]]'') with \"[[Alive and Kicking (song)|Alive and Kicking]]\" which peaked at number 3 in the US, and \"[[Sanctify Yourself]]\" (''Billboard'' Top 100 number 14), yet the band is remembered primarily for the first song.<ref name=\"Simple Minds\">{{cite web|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-one-hit-wonders-2018-5|title=The 57 best one-hit wonders of all time|first=Gabbi|last=Shaw|website=Thisisinsider.com|accessdate=December 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226232753/https://www.thisisinsider.com/best-one-hit-wonders-2018-5|archive-date=December 26, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, some artists with long, successful careers have been identified as one-hit wonders by virtue of having reached the Top 40 of the Hot 100 only once. ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' editor Matt Melis lists [[Beck]] (\"[[Loser (Beck song)|Loser]]\") and the [[Grateful Dead]] (\"[[Touch of Grey]]\") as \"technically\" being one-hit wonders despite their large bodies of work.{{sfn|Melis|2016|p=1}} ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' mentions prolific artist [[Frank Zappa]] as a one-hit wonder because his only Top 40 hit was \"[[Valley Girl (song)|Valley Girl]]\" in 1982.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2009}}\n\nChris Molanphy says that an artist can only be seen as a \"one hit wonder\" if they have never had a second Billboard top 10 hit, if any subsequent top 40 singles were released within six months of their first big hit, and if the artist has not had three or more top 10 or Platinum albums.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226175321/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/09/carly_rae_jepsen_one_hit_wonder.php?page=all|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2012/09/carly_rae_jepsen_one_hit_wonder.php?page=all|title=100 & Single: Three Rules To Define The Term \"One-Hit Wonder\" In 2012|author=Chris Molanphy|archive-date=February 26, 2013|access-date=August 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/dont_call_them_one_hit_wonders/|title=Don't call them \"one-hit wonders\"|author=Annie Zaleski|access-date=August 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190803151256/https://www.salon.com/2014/09/07/dont_call_them_one_hit_wonders/|archive-date=August 3, 2019|url-status=live|date=September 7, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Multiple appearances==\nBritish musician [[Tony Burrows]] sang the lead vocal on five one-hit wonders: [[Edison Lighthouse]]'s \"[[Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)]]\" (February 1970); [[White Plains (band)|White Plains]]' \"[[My Baby Loves Lovin']]\" (March 1970); [[the Pipkins]]' \"[[Gimme Dat Ding (song)|Gimme Dat Ding]]\" (April 1970); [[the First Class]]' \"[[Beach Baby]]\" (July 1974); and \"[[United We Stand (song)|United We Stand]]\" (1970) by the first incarnation of the [[Brotherhood of Man]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-08-30/entertainment/ca-38886_1_tony-burrows|title=From Bankable Burrows to One-Hit Wonders|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|date=August 30, 1996|accessdate=November 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Newman |first=Melinda |title=Rhino Gets Nostalgic With DeFrancos and Turtles in First (We Hope Not Last) Retrofest |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media |date=August 28, 1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nggEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA18 |page=18 |volume=111 |number=35 |issn=0006-2510}}</ref>\n\n[[Joey Levine]], American session singer best known for his prolific work in the [[bubblegum pop]] and commercial [[jingle]] genera, who had recorded hits for [[the Ohio Express]] (\"[[Yummy Yummy Yummy]]\"), also sang hits for [[The Third Rail (band)|the Third Rail]], the [[Kasenetz-Katz Singing Orchestral Circus]] (\"Quick Joey Small\") and Reunion (\"[[Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)]]\").<ref>Cooper, Kim (April 26, 2006).

Unionist postcard 1912]]\n'''Unionism in Ireland''' is a political tradition on the island that professes loyalty to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Crown]] and [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from The [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang a United Irish insurgent, Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\n\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]], an insurrection joined in the south by Catholic peasantry.'''\n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union. For the chief of Castle executive [[Lord Castlereagh]], the principal merit of a bringing Ireland directly under the British constitution was a resolution of what was ultimately the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question.:<ref>John Bew, Castlereagh. Enlightenment, War and Tyranny. Quercas. London 2012. P. 127</ref>\n<blockquote>Linked with England, the Protestants, feeling less exposed, would be more confident and liberal; and the Catholics would have less inducement to look beyond that indulgence which is consistent with the security of our establishment.<ref>Castlereagh to Sir Laurence Parsons, 28 November 1798, Castlereagh Correspondence, vol. 11, pp. 32-35</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, opposition from within this \"establishment,\" and not least from the King, [[King George III|George III]], obliged Castlereagh to defy what he saw as \"the very logic of the Union.\"<ref>Bew (2012). p.126</ref> The Union bill that, with a generous distribution of titles and emoluments, he put through the Irish Parliament omitted the provision for Catholic emancipation. A separate Irish executive in Dublin was retained, but representation, still wholly Protestant, was transferred to Westminster constituted as the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nIn decades that followed the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union (1800)]] Protestants of every sectarian persuasion and class reconciled to the loss of an Irish parliament. The legislative union with [[Great Britain]] was seen to not only to occasion their relative prosperity but, as the Roman Catholic majority in Ireland began to stir and gather in a new national movement, also to guarantee their \"liberty.\"\n\n===Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of Nationalist Ireland===\n[[File:Catholic ascendency.jpg|thumb|right|Catholic Emancipation as a world turned upside down: held aloft, Daniel O'Connell promises whigs--symbol of Ascendancy rank and property--for \"ye all.\"]]\nIt took the Union thirty years to deliver on the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829)\u2014to admit Catholics to Parliament--and permit an erosion of the Protestant monopoly on position and influence.  An opportunity, had the Union been earlier \"complete,\" to integrate Catholics through their re-emerging propertied and professional classes as a \"dilute minority\" may have passed. As it was, on the morrow of Emancipation it was clear they had chosen \"another route.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title = Modern Ireland 1600-1972t|last = Foster|first = R.

Emancipated within the jurisdiction of the [[Westminster]] parliament, Catholics had to preface principle with the vindication of an historical right\u2014of the Irish as \u201ca people\u201d deserving of a separate representation.  Ireland was re-imagined as a political nation through popular history, balladry, and literature which chronicled the centuries-long resistance of \"the [[Gaels|Gael]]\" and, when all else was lost, of the \"dark days\" of endurance under the [[Penal Laws]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Inventing the Nation: Ireland|last = Comerford|first = R.V.|publisher = Arnold|year = 2003|isbn=0-340-73112-5|location = London}}</ref> Scarcely avoided was the suggestion that in this \"story of the nation\" Irish Protestants were, as [[John Banim]] (the \"[[Walter Scott]] of Ireland\") proposed, \"half-countrymen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = When God Took Sides: Religion and Identity in Irish History - Unfinished History|last = Elliott|first = Marianne|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn=978-0-19-920693-3|location = Oxford|page = 38 }}</ref>\n\nOne response to this imputation of \"foreignness\" to Protestants was inscribed defiantly upon the [[Williamite]] banners of the marching [[Orange Order]]: \"[[Siege of Derry|Derry]], [[Battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]], and the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]],\" \"Sons of Conquerors.\" But short of embracing what Catholics viewed as Ascendancy \"triumphalism,\" the difficulty for Protestants in orientating themselves to the national movement was acute. It was made more so by the reality that in the greater part of country the only element around which the movement could reliably build was the Catholic clergy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=MacDonagh|first=Oliver|title=The Politicisation of the Irish Catholic Bishops 1800-1850 |journal=The Historical Journal|date=1975|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37\u201353|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638467?seq=1}}</ref>\n\n===Protestant unity and the New Reformation===\n\n[[Image:Protestant Unity.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1899 penny print of Henry Cooke's 1841 speech in \"reply to Daniel O'Connell\"]]\nIn an incident celebrated by unionists, in 1841, disdaining to engage a \"bully . . . the Cock of the North,\" O\u2019Connell refused the challenge of the then Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly, [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]], to debate Repeal in Belfast.\n<blockquote>Look at the town of Belfast.

This was a revivalist movement that owed much to Ulster-Presbyterian ministries in the United States (from where Cooke received his doctorate). The belief it carried in personal empowerment through faith was to lend itself in Ireland to a politically-charged prosperity gospel. ''In The Mystery Solved: or, Ireland's Miseries; the Grand Cause and Cure'', a work that caused a \"sensation\" on its publication in 1852 (a copy was sent to every member of Parliament, and one was \"graciously accepted\" by Queen Victoria),  Dr. Edward Marcus Dill, a \"General  missionary agent\" of the Presbyterian Assembly, argued that the poverty of Catholic Ireland  was rooted, not in a history of political disability, but in a counterfeit faith.<ref>.{{cite web||author=W.

They continued to baulk at the Ascendancy's high [[Tory]] politics and patronage of the Orange Order. With other [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformists]], at election Presbyterians tended to favour [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] (notwithstanding their dalliance with O'Connell) or, as they later emerged tenant-rights [[Liberal Party|Liberals]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Ulster Liberalism|last = Hall|first = Gerald|publisher = Four Courts Press|year = 2011|location = Dublin|isbn= 978-1-84682-202-5}}</ref> But Cooke's \u201cmarriage banns\u201d were \u201ca portent of the future.\u201d  Their call for a pan-Protestant alliance resonated from the moment it was clear that nationalists, where they had failed to persuade in Ulster, were beginning to succeed in England.\n\n===The Irish party challenge at Westminster===\n[[File:Gladstone and Land League.jpg|thumb|William Gladstone writing legislation under pressure from the Land League. Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923|last=Beckett|first=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1966|isbn=0-571-09267-5|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall. In the British [[House of Commons]] Butt was seconded by another maverick from the north, a Catholic convert, [[Joseph Biggar]]. Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern (albeit half-American) Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Irish History|last=Duffy|first=Sean|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1997|isbn=0-7171-2479-7|location=Dublin|pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892 (3).jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction--toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North--textiles, engineering, shipbuilding--for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing.

People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''.

However, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, his nephew [[Gerald Balfour]], determined upon a \u201cconstructive\u201d course, pursuing reforms intended, as some saw it, to \u201ckill home rule with kindness.\u201d\n\nFor the express purpose of relieving poverty and reducing emigration, in the \u201c[[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|congested districts]]\u201d of the west Balfour initiated a programme not only of public works, but of subsidy for local craft industries. A new Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction broke with the traditions of Irish Boards by announcing that its aim was to \"be in touch with public opinion of the classes whom its work concerns, and to rely largely for its success upon their active assistance and co-operation.\"<ref>Good (1920). p, 210</ref> It supported and encouraged dairy cooperatives, the \"creameries\" that were to be an important institution in the emergence of a new class of independent smallholders.<ref>Bardon (2009) pp. 421-423</ref>\n\nGreater reform followed when, with the support of the splinter [[Liberal Unionist Party]], Salisbury returned to office in 1895. [[Land Acts (Ireland)|The Land Act of 1896]] introduced for the first time the principle of compulsory sale to tenants, through its application was limited to bankrupt estates. \u201cYou would suppose,\u201d said [[Sir Edward Carson]], Dublin barrister and the leading spokesman for Irish Conservatives, \u201cthat the Government were revolutionists verging on Socialism.\u201d.<ref>Good (1920), p. 209</ref> Having been first obliged to surrender their hold on local government (transferred at a stroke in 1898 to democratically-elected councils), the old landlord class had the terms of their retirement fixed by the [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Wyndham Land Act]] of 1903.

Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon. In the great [[1907 Belfast Dock strike|Belfast Dock strike of 1907]], the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] leader [[James Larkin]] was able to engage the support of the [[Independent Orange Order]].<ref>Collins, Peter (1998). \"Larkin, James\", S.J. Connolly, The Oxford Companion to Irish History. Oxford University Press. p. 302</ref> (In 1903 its founder, Tom Sloan, had been the only Unionist MP to vote for the Miners' Eight Hour bill).\n\nLoyalist workers were conscious, and resentful, of the imputation that they were the retainers of \u201cbig-house unionists.\u201d  A manifesto signed in the spring of 1914 by two thousand labour men, on behalf of the only \u201cfully organised and articulate\u201d trade unionists in Ireland, repudiated the suggestion of the radical and socialist press that Ulster was being manipulated by \u201can aristocratic plot.\u201d If Sir Edward Carson led in the battle for the Union it was \u201cbecause we, the workers, the people, the democracy of Ulster, have chosen him.\u201d  Chairman of the Boilermakers\u2019 Society, J. Hanna, insisted that it was as the \u201cfreemen and as members of the greatest democracy in Great Britain and Ireland, the organised trade unions of the country,\u201d that \u201cthey would not have Home Rule.\u201d<ref>John Biggs-Davison, ''The Hand is Red''. London, Johnson. 1973. P. 74</ref>\n\nThe difficulty for nationalists and for those, like [[James Connolly]], who believed that class solidarity should draw workers down the path of national independence, was that without having to break political ranks with their employers, workers were beginning to see that \u201cgreatest democracy\u201d was paying dividends. Thanks to the legislative union, in whose defence Unionists among them effectively voted Conservative, workers in Ireland were able to benefit from the majorities found \u201cacross the water\u201d for labour and social reform-\u2014under the a Liberal-majority government from 1906, for the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], for the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] and for the \u201c[[People's Budget]] 1911. \u00a0\n\nThe nationalist cause in the industrial North was not helped by those who suggested that collective bargaining, social security and progressive taxation were principles for which majorities would not be as readily found in a Dublin Parliament. Objecting to an \u201cinefficient and extravagant government . . . which had no parallel in Europe,\u201d ''[[Sinn Fein]]'' President [[Arthur Griffith]] proposed that \u201cimperialism and socialism\u2014forms of the cosmopolitan heresy and in essence one\u2014have offered man the material world.

A total of 234,046 women signed the Ulster Women's Declaration; 237,368 men signed the [[Ulster Covenant|Solemn League and Covenant]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ulster Covenant|last=Gordon|first=Lucy|publisher=Ulster society|year=1989|location=Belfast}}</ref>\n\nUnionist women had been involved in political campaigning from the time of the first Home Rule Bill in 1886. Some were active [[suffragette]]s. [[Isabella Tod]], an anti-Home Rule Liberal and campaigner for girls education, was an early pioneer. In 1873 she founded the Northern Irish branch of the [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]]. Later, while still based in Belfast, this became the [[Irish Women's Suffrage Society]] publishing the weekly ''The Irish Citizen''.<ref>Courtney (2013). pp. 240-241</ref>\n\nNot all IWSS Unionists were impressed by the Women's Declaration. Elizabeth McCracken, a regular contributor to ''The Irish Citizen'' and the [[Belfast News Letter]] noted the failure Unionist women to formulate \"any demand on their own behalf or that of their own sex.\"<ref>History Ireland, Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis, https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/</ref> The Declaration, nonetheless, was a political affirmation of intent by women, organised and publicly staged by women--the Ulster Women's Unionist Council. Founded in January 1911, by 1913, with well over 100,000 members, the UWUC was the largest women's political group in Ireland.\n\nDetermined to \"sink all differences in favour of the Union,\" the UWUC avoided public comment on the suffrage question. But for many women signing the Council's Declaration was a first taste of political involvement. In September 1913 it appeared that the Unionist Council had determined it should not be their last. The Council informed the UWUC that \"the draft articles\" for a Provisional Government to be set up in the event of Home Rule being legislated \"include the franchise for women.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/|title=Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis|accessdate=8 March 2020|author=History Ireland}}</ref> The Irish Parliamentary Party made no such commitment for a Dublin parliament.  In contrast to Ulster Unionists who divided, in 1912 the Nationalists had voted as a block against a \"Conciliation\" Bill that would have conceded the principle of women suffrage, albeit on a highly restrictive property basis.<ref>Burke, Jason (2018), \"Carson's Betrayal of Women?

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm|title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23rd, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been--as Carson later accounted it--a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/|title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \u201ctypical Irishman\u201d\u2018|last=archive.org|website=www.sluggerotoole.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland. Sinn Fein sweeps the south and west]]\nWith the Nationalists seeking to match the Ulster Volunteers by drilling and arming of [[National Volunteers]], in July 1914 King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] called the parties to a [[Buckingham Palace Conference|conference of Buckingham Palace]].  The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4th 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . . We do not seeks to purchase terms by selling our patriotism.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title =Dividing Ireland: World War One and Partition|last = Hennessey|first = Thomas|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|location = London|pages = 72}}</ref>\n\nThat, however, was how Redmond's position came to be perceived on the nationalist side. Seizing upon \u201cEngland difficulty,\u201d contingents of republican [[Irish Volunteers]] and Connolly's [[Irish Citizen Army|Citizen Army]],  ensured that while Irishmen, at Redmond's urging, were sacrificing themselves for the sake of \u201cCatholic Belgium,\u201d Britain could be seen on the streets of [[Easter Rising|Dublin in Easter 1916]] suppressing an Irish \u201cstrike for freedom.\u201d In the aftermath of the Rising and in the course of a [[Conscription Crisis|national campaign against military conscription]], the IPP \u2018s capital was exhausted.<ref>Hennessey (1998)</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title =The Resurrection of Ireland: The Sinn F\u00e9in Party, 1916-1923|last = Laffan|first = Michael|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|location = Cambridge|isbn=9781139106849}}</ref>\n\nSensing an opportunity, at the hastily arranged [[Irish Convention]] in Dublin in 1917, the Southern unionists' leader [[St John Brodrick, 1st Earl of Midleton|Lord Middleton]] offered the beleaguered IPP the immediate establishment of an all-Ireland parliament that, among other guarantees for unionists, would split fiscal powers with Westminster and surrender any ambition for an independent tariff policy. But the decision of the Lloyd George and his Cabinet to simultaneously introduce conscription to Ireland--in effect, to make the first order of an Irish government cooperation in the impressment of men for the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]--ruined the credibility of the proposal  with nationalists<ref>[[Stephen Gwynn|Gwynn, Stephen]] (1919), ''John Redmond's last Years'' Ch.

He proposed a United Kingdom federation of England, Scotland, Ulster and the South of Ireland. But the plan evoked no nationalist response.<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973). p. 94</ref>\n\nIn the \"[[Khaki election]]\" of December 1918, the first Westminster poll since 1910 and the first with all adult males and women from age thirty eligible to vote (the electorate tripled), the IPP was almost wholly replaced in nationalist constituencies by Sinn F\u00e9in. Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title =Revolutionary Government in Ireland|last = Mitchell|first = Arthur|publisher = Gill & Macmillan|year = 1995|location = Dublin|isbn=0-7171-2015-5|pages = 310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\"). The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin. In a joint Council, the two parliaments would be free to enter into all-Ireland arrangements.\n\nIn 1921, elections for these parliaments were duly held.

Belfast, like [[Ottawa]], had a two-chamber [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], a Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] ([[Sir James Craig]]), and [[the Crown]] represented by a [[Governor of Northern Ireland|Governor]] ([[James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn|the Duke of Abercorn]]) and advised by a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Council]]. All this was suggestive, not a devolved administration within the United Kingdom, but of a state constituted under the Crown outside the direct jurisdiction of the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe impression that Ireland as a whole was being removed from the orbit of Westminster politics was reinforced by refusal of the parties of Government and Opposition to organise, or canvass for votes, in the six counties.<ref>{{Cite book|title =Fatal Influence: The Impact of Ireland on British Politics|last = Mathews|first = Kevin|publisher = University College Dublin Press|year = 2004|location = Dublin|isbn=978-1904558057|pages = 310}}</ref>  The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] were content that [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MPs took their party [[whip]] in the [[House of Commons]] where, by general agreement, matters within the competence of the Belfast Parliament could not be raised.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title = The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964|last = Lawrence|first = R.J..|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1965|location = Oxford|pages = 40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Dudley Edwards | first = Ruth | title = Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 May 2005 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first act of Northern Ireland legislature was to overturn a British attempt to maximise the representation of a minority-populated \"centre ground.\" In 1919 [[proportional representation]] (PR) had been prescribed for all Irish elections. In the January 1920 urban council elections in Ulster preference voting assisted nationalists to the control of 21 of 45 townships, including [[Omagh]], [[Newry]] and \"what was the greatest blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]].<ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref>  In Belfast, where under the old [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]] Unionists had taken 52 of 60 council seats, under PR the nationalists were able to take ten, although perhaps \"most disturbing to Carson and his followers\" was the success of twelve labour candidates (ten for the independent [[Belfast Labour Party]]).<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 20</ref>  In the county, and rural district, council elections that followed in June 1920 nationalists took control of two of the six counties (Fermanagh and, for the first time Tyrone) and 36 of the 55 districts.\n\nThe twelve anti-partitionist MPs returned in May 1921 to the fifty-two member Northern parliament refused to take their seats. They joined nationalist councillors, and large numbers of Catholic school officials and teachers, in pledging themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy|last = Kingsley|first = Paul|publisher = Belfast Publicationss|year = 1989|location = Belfast|isbn = 0951554905|pages = 19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

It was an almost entirely Protestant force, an excuse the nationalists alleged for arming Orangemen.

Consistent with the obligation under the Government of Ireland Act to neither establish nor endow a religion, a 1923 Education Act provided that in schools religious instruction would only be permitted after school hours and with parental consent. Lord Londonderry, as Minister of Education, owned that his ambition was mixed Protestant-Catholic education. In a reprise of the reception of Dublin-Castle National Schools proposal a century before, a coalition of Protestant clerics, school principals and Orangemen insisted on the imperative of bible teaching. Craig relented, amending the act in 1925. Meanwhile, the Catholic hierarchy refused to transfer any schools, and would not allow male Catholic student teachers to enrol in a common training college with Protestants or women.<ref> {{cite web|title= Lord Londonderry & Education Reform in 1920s Northern Ireland |author= Neil Fleming |url=http://www.historyireland.com/troubles-in-ni/ni-1920-present/lord-londonderry-education-reform-in-1920s-northern-ireland/|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> In the North (as in the South) a pillar of sectarian division, the school-age segregation of Protestants and Catholics, was sustained.\n\nIn looking to the post-war future, the Unionist Government under Basil Brooke ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]]) did make two reform commitments. First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London--understood as a reward for the province's wartime service--to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title = History of Northern Ireland|last = Buckland|first = Patrick|publisher =Gill & Macmillan|year = 1981|location = Dublin|isbn = 9780717110698|pages = 83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security. Under the Housing Act (NI) 1945 the public subvention for new home construction was even greater, proportionately, than in England and Wales. The distinction between rural and urban housing was abolished, and local councils become housing authorities.<ref>Wichert (1981, pp. 43-49</ref>\n\n===1960s: reform and protest===\n[[File:NICRA 1968 Derry march.jpg|thumb|upright]]\nIn the 1960s, under premiership of [[Terence O'Neill]], Ulster Unionism was led through seeming economic-policy successes into a political crisis that upended the 1921 devolved constitution. A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title = Ulster at the Crossroads|last = O'Neill|first = Terence|publisher = Faber & Faber|year = 1969|location = London|pages = 11}}</ref> \n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres). In its own terms, the strategy was a success: the level of manufacturing employment was better than sustained. Yet Protestant workers and local Unionist leadership were unsettled. Unlike the established family firms and skilled-trades apprenticeships that had  been \"a backbone of unionism and protestant privilege,\" the new companies readily employed Catholics and women.<ref>Wichert (1981). pp. 87-89</ref> \n\nUnionist unease was particularly acute in Derry and the west.<ref>{{Cite book |title =Ireland Since 1939, the Persistence of Conflict|last = Patterson|first = Henry|publisher = Penguin|year = 2006|location = Dublin|isbn = 978-1844881048|pages = 126-129}}</ref> Already in 1956 O'Neill's predecessor, [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookborough]], had received a delegation \"on industries\" from Derry Unionists \"anxious that we not get an invasion from the other side.\"<ref>Minute prepared for meeting with the Prime Minister, 13 September 1956, Public Records Office Northern Ireland, PRONI Brookeborough Papers, 5/95/10</ref> \nWhen Derry lost out to Coleraine for siting of the [[Ulster University|New University of Ulster]], and to [[Lurgan]] and [[Portadown]] for [[Craigavon|a new urban-industrial development]], some \"from the other side\" suspected a wider conspiracy.

Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism. \n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]].

Irish commemorative postage stamp, 2015]]O'Neill had not disguised an ambition to bring the politics as well as the economy of Northern Ireland \"into the twentieth century.\" In January 1965, at O'Neill personal invitation, the ''[[taoiseach]]'' [[Sean Lemass]] (whose government was pursuing a similar \"modernising\" agenda in the South) made an unheralded visit to Stormont. After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]]. \n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/|title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical|website=ianpaisley.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics. He had been one of the founders of [[Ulster Protestant Action]] (UPA).

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed. \n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election| general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain. As a part of the United Kingdom we have always considered this to be our right. But we cannot be a part of the United Kingdom merely when it suits us. And those who talk so glibly about acts of impoverished defiance do not know or care what is at stake. Your job if you are a worker at Shorts or Harland and Wolff; your subsidies if you are a farmer; your pension if you are retired; all these aspects of our life, and many others depend on support from Britain.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more. This places at the heart of the conflict the movement for the \"civil rights of the Catholic/Nationalist community.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil Rights and Peace Agreements |last=Bell |first=Chirstine|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=33}}</ref> It is the belief that many in that community came to support or acquiesce in the Republican return to \"physical force\" in 1970-71 because, in the words of [[Eamonn McCann]], the notion that it was possible to achieve full citizenship within the North \"was beaten out of people's heads by the cops and their semi-official auxiliaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=McCann: War and Peace in Northern Ireland |last=McCann |first=Eamonn |year=1998 |publisher=Hot Press Books |location=Dublin|page=145}}</ref><ref>See also {{Cite book|title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |last=) Dochtartaigh |first=Nail|year=1997|publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork}} </ref> \n\nAs an account of The Troubles, this is consistent with the broad support that the two main nationalist parties expressed for the provision in the Agreement for a possible Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.

Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and--Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson. If inadvertently, the civil-rights agitation fostered the perceptions of deteriorating security and legitimacy that contributed not only to the introduction of British troops (August 1969) but also, over the course of 1970-71, to the ascendancy within IRA-Sinn F\u00e9in of an ultra-nationalist [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|\"Provisional\" wing]] committed to a return to republicanism's \"physical force\" tradition.<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 172-198</ref><ref>See also Nelson McCausland (2018), \"Why unionists must ensure that the true origins of the civil rights movement are not forgotten\".

Attacks on \"Crown forces\" and their supporting infrastructure, gave the Provisional IRA a broad field to target Protestants: locally recruited soldiers of the [[Ulster Defence Regiment]]/[[Royal Irish Regiment]] (successors to the Specials), members of the judiciary and prison services and base ancillary workers in areas such as construction and food services.

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

When, as might have been anticipated, Faulkner resigned rather than comply, Heath in an instant shattered, for unionists, \"the theory that the Army was simply in Northern Ireland for the purpose of offering aid to the civil power, of defending legally established institutions against terrorist attack.\" In what unionists viewed as a \"victory for violence\", the Conservative government prorogued Stormont and imposed direct rule \"not merely to restore order but to reshape the Province's system of government.\"<ref>Utley (1975), p. 89</ref>\n\n==Negotiating the \"Irish Dimension\": 1973-1998==\n===Sunningdale and the Ulster Workers strike===\nIn October 1972 the British government brought out a Green Paper, ''The Future of Northern Ireland''. It articulated what were to be the enduring principles of the British approach to a settlement. <blockquote>It is a fact that an element of the minority in Northern Ireland has hitherto seen itself as simply part of the wider Irish community. The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and hose they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Office|year=1972|title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland|pages=140|location=London|publisher= HMSO|}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly. Following negotiations at Sunningdale in England, attended by the Dublin government, on 1 January 1974 the former Unionist prime minister Brian Faulkner agreed to form an Executive in coalition with the SDLP and the smaller \"cross-community\" [[Alliance Party]]. Faulkner's later successor as party leader, [[James Molyneaux]], argued that the difficulty for most unionists  was not an arrangement in which \"Protestants and Catholics must consent\"--that \"would be comparatively simple.\" It was that, despite a promise not share power with parties \"whose ''primary'' aim is a united Ireland\",<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first= Barry|year=1984|title=John Hume: Statesman of the Troubles|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=9780856403170|pages=140}}</ref> Faulkner had committed them to agreement with \"Republican Catholics\" <ref>Interview with James Molyneaux, 18 May 1982 quoted in {{cite book|last=O'Malley|first= Padraig |year=1983|title=The Uncivil Wars: Ireland Today|pages=17, 26, 39|location=Boston|publisher= Houghton Mifflin|isbn=039534414X}}</ref> \n\nHaving drawn on both the [[Republican Labour Party|Republican]], and [[Northern Ireland Labour Party|Northern Ireland, Labour]] parties, and with a commitment to \"accommodate progressive Protestants,\"  the SDLP had announced themselves as something more than nationalist or republican party.<ref>{{cite book|last=Devlin|first= Paddy|year=1993|title=Straight Left: an Autobiography|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=0856405140|pages=191}}</ref> But with PIRA continuing to draw on fury over internment and Bloody Sunday, Eamonn McCann notes that \"in order to sell the deal to the Catholic community the SDLP had to present it not just as a means of expressing its aspiration towards a united Ireland but a means of achieving it\".<ref>McCann (1980), p. 141</ref> The new Health and Social Service Minister, [[Paddy Devlin]], conceded that \"all other issues were governed\" by a drive to \"get all-Ireland institutions established\" that would \"produce the dynamic that would lead ultimately to an agreed united Ireland.\"<ref>Devlin, p. 205</ref> \n\nThe [[Sunningdale Agreement]] envisaged a Council of Ireland comprising, with equal delegations from Dublin and Belfast, a Council of Ministers with \"executive and harmonising functions\" and a Consultative Assembly with \"advisory and review functions.\" As they would only have a plurality of representation on the Northern side, these created the possibility of Unionists being manoeuvred into a minority position. \"In retrospect\", Devlin regretted his party had not \"adopted a two stage approach, by allowing power sharing at Stormont to establish itself\",<ref>Devlin, p. 252</ref> but by the time he and his colleagues recognised the damage they had caused to Faulkner's position by prioritising the \"Irish Dimension\" it was too late. \n\nWithin a week of taking office as First Minister, opposition to the Sunningdale proposals forced Faulkner to resign as UUP leader. In a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|surprise Westminster election]] at the end of February, his new pro-Agreement grouping, the [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]], was rolled over by a [[United Ulster Unionist Coalition]] in which the bulk of his old party stood with William Craig's [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Ulster Vanguard]] and Paisley's new electoral vehicle, the [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]]. Arguing that they had deprived Faulkner of any semblance of a mandate, the victors called for new Assembly elections. \n\nWhen on 14 May the Assembly defeated a motion rejecting the Sunningdale Agreement, Harry Murray, the shipyard convener for the [[Ulster Workers' Council]] (UWC), a loyalist labour coalition, announced a general strike. Within two weeks the UWC, supported by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and UVF paramilitaries, had an effective stranglehold on energy supplies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Don|year=1994|title=Fourteen May Days:\nThe Inside Story of the Loyalist Strike of 1974|location=Dublin|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|isbn=0717121771}}</ref> Concessions sought by Faulkner were blocked by the SDLP.

From the UUP's James Molyneaux there were the familiar objections to \"something very far removed from straightforward democracy\" and which could give republicans an effective \"veto.\"  But with Paisley calling on unionists not to \"lose sight\" of an opportunity for the \"Ulster people\" to \"freely elect their own Assembly and to begin to bring Direct Rule to account\", there was not blanket rejection.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 372-373</ref> That was to come from nationalists.\n\nJohn Hume dismissed the initiative as \"insulting.\" Not only did it imply, with the 70 percent hurdle, a very much higher degree of unionist unanimity and consent than was required in 1973, it suggested that, for the present at least, the Irish Dimension\" would have adequate \"institutional expression\" in continuing \"intergovernmental\" exchanges with Dublin--then at a low point following the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|PIRA Hunger Strike]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|year=2003|title= 'Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady|location=London|publisher= Jonathan Cape|pages=426}}</ref> Seconded by the Dublin government, SDLP insisted that without of \"a very strong and positive and concrete expression of the Irish identity\" the proposals were unworkable.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 368-369</ref> \n\nThree years later, London appeared to reverse tack. The Thatcher government chose to give positive expression to the Irish Dimension ''in advance'' of agreement on devolution. With the [[Taoiseach|Irish Taoiseach]], [[Garret FitzGerald]] Thatcher signed an agreement that, for the first time, gave Dublin a formal consultative role in Northern Ireland and in matters beyond security cooperation. An [[British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference|Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] would invite the Irish government to \"put forward views on proposals\" for major legislation concerning Northern Ireland, and this Conference would have a permanent [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]], including officials from the Republic's [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]], quartered in Northern Ireland itself.\n\nThe possibility, in the wake of the Hunger Strike, of deflecting criticism not only from the Republic but also from the United States was part of the British calculation<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bew|first1=Paul|last2=Patterson|first2=Henry|year=1985|title= The British State and the Ulster Crisis: From Wilson to Thatcher|location=London|publisher= Verso Books|isbn=978-0860918158|pages=112}}</ref><ref>Wichert (1991), pp. 194-195.</ref> But both in London and in Dublin, where John Hume was closely advising Fitzgerald,<ref>{{cite book|last=McKitrick|first=David|year=1993|title= Dispatches from Belfast|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|pages=9}}</ref> it was anticipated that the Agreement would intensify pressure on unionists to climb down from a position of \"simple majority rule.\" Proposals from The Irish government would be entertained only on \"matters [that] are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.\" If unionists wished to halt a forward roll toward joint sovereignty, the suggestion was that they would have to think again as to how nationalists could be accommodated at Stormont. \n\nThe unionist reaction, Thatcher recalled in her memoirs, was \"worse than anyone had predicted to me\".<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (London: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 403.</ref> The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) led an \"Ulster says No\"  campaign against the Agreement, that included strikes, [[civil disobedience]] and a mass resignation of unionist MPs from Westminster and suspensions of district council meetings.<ref name=aia>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm Anglo-Irish Agreement \u2013 Chronology of Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206111841/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm |date=1 April 2020}}.

In 1912 Ulster unionists had the Conservatives' fulsome support. Standing beside Carson the Tory leader [[Andrew Bonar Law]] declared  \u201cI can imagine no lengths of resistance to which Ulster can go in which I would not be prepared to support her.\u201d Now unionists were facing a Conservative government imposition, and a Westminster Labour opposition committed to Irish unity. With no obvious political leverage and possibly to preempt initiative passing to the loyalist paramilitaries, in November 1986 Paisley (not for the first time) announced his own \"third force\": the [[Ulster Resistance]] Movement (URM) who would \"take direct action as and when required.\" Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined. Despite importing arms, some of which were passed on to the UVF and UDA, for the URM the call for \"action\" never came.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ian Paisley death: He was lauded and reviled ... but a

While nationalism has had a number of Protestant leaders (for instance, [[Henry Grattan]], [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Douglas Hyde]]), unionism was invariably always led by Protestant leaders and politicians. Prior to a decades-long ban, Catholics had been allowed to be members of the UUP as recently as the 1920s, including [[Denis Henry]] (the first [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]), who was a member of the UUP from its foundation in 1905 and a UUP MP for [[South Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|South Londonderry]].

However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain). Recent influxes of immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, are also having a significant effect on the demographic balance, although how many choose to reside permanently in Northern Ireland or take an interest in the political scene remains to be seen.\n\n===Ties to Unionism in Scotland===\nThere is some degree of social and political co-operation between some [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionists]] and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity of their [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] with the United Kingdom. For example, the [[Orange Order]] parades in Orange Walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, many unionists in Scotland shy away from connections to unionism in Ireland in order not to endorse any side of a largely sectarian conflict. This brand of unionism is largely concentrated in the [[Central Belt]] and west of Scotland. [[Loyalist]]s in Scotland are seen as a militant or extreme branch of [[British unionism|unionism]]. Orangism in west and central Scotland, and opposition to it by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Scotland, can be explained as a result of the large amount of immigration from the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nSongs and symbols of unionism, particularly of the Northern Irish variety, are used by many supporters of [[Rangers F.C.]], a football club based in [[Glasgow]]. Both Rangers and their longtime rival [[Celtic F.C.]], which has Irish Roman Catholic roots, have a reputation for [[sectarian]] clashes and bitter opposition to each other, frequently characterised by religious taunts, chants and other provocations. This behaviour by some supporters is condemned by the management of the clubs. Despite the symbols associated with the clubs, not all Rangers supporters can be automatically classified as unionists, nor all Celtic supporters as nationalists. For example, there were Celtic supporters of the \"No Thanks\" campaign for the 2014 independence referendum and Rangers supporters of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign- despite Celtic FC having nationalist origins and Rangers FC having unionist origins. There was found to be no link between support of left and right-wing parties at general elections for Rangers or Celtic fans either.\n\n==Unionists in southern Ireland 1891\u20131922 {{anchor|Irish unionism}}==\n\n{{main|Irish Unionist Alliance#Southern Unionists}}\n\nAfter 1890, and particularly during the period from the start of the [[First World War]] to the mid-1920s, the number of Unionists in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant.<ref>McDowell, R.B. ''Crisis and Decline: The Fate of the Southern Unionists''. The Lilliput Press (1998).</ref> This is attributed to a number of factors:\n* [[Land reform]] from the 1870s to the 1900s, arranged by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]]. This broke up many of the large Protestant-owned estates, many of whose former owners chose in the 1920s to use their compensation money to settle in Britain, often in other estates that they owned there.\n* The disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1871. This led the Church to sell many of its properties, in the process laying off many Protestant workers who subsequently moved away.\n* The [[Irish War of Independence]] and its aftermath. During the War, some elements of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) allegedly conducted a campaign of murder and [[ethnic cleansing]] against Unionists in parts of the country such as Cork. Historians disagree as to whether such murders were isolated incidents or parts of a wider organised campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Attacks continued in the 1920s against many Unionists who had assisted the British in the War, and in the process 300 historic homes were burned. Such attacks were said to be reprisals for the British forces' destruction of the homes and property of [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], actual or suspected.\n* Emigration. Large numbers of Unionists left Ireland (voluntarily or otherwise) in the years before and after independence, mainly for [[Northern Ireland]], Great Britain and Canada.\n* Assimilation. Many of the Unionists who remained [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to some extent into the majority nationalist culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This was encouraged by the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] government, and was largely accepted with resignation. The process was accelerated by the pro-Free State stance taken by most Unionists in the [[Irish Civil War]]. The process of assimilation had begun prior to Irish independence, with a number of [[Protestant Nationalist]]s playing leading roles in the [[Irish nationalist]] and [[Gaelic revival]] movements.\n* Intermarriage and the ''Ne Temere'' decree. Unionists were and are {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} largely Protestant, and in many mixed households the children were brought up as Catholics, often because of family or community pressure and the 1908 papal ''[[Ne Temere]]'' decree. There was also a high number of single, unmarried female Unionists in the aftermath of World War I who could not find Protestant husbands.<ref>See Bence-Jones, Mark ''Twilight of the Ascendancy\" Constable, London 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-09-472350-4}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] (1938\u20131945) was Protestant, though only two senior Irish politicians attended his Church of Ireland funeral; the Catholic members of the government had to wait on the pavement near the Church to be compliant with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\nSome Unionists in the south simply adapted and began to associate themselves with the new southern Irish regime of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On 19 January 1922, leading Unionists held a meeting and unanimously decided to support the Free State government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many gained appointment to the Free State's Senate, including the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] and [[Thomas Westropp Bennett]]. Several generations of one Unionist political family, the Dockrells, won election as [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TDs). The Dublin borough of [[Rathmines]] had a unionist majority up to the late 1920s, when a local government re-organisation abolished all Dublin borough councils. Later, the Earl of Granard and the Provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]] gained appointment to the President of Ireland's advisory body, the [[Council of State]]. Most Irish Unionists, however, simply withdrew from public life, and from the late 1920s there were no self-professed Unionists elected to the Irish parliament until the election of [[Ian Marshall (farmer)|Ian Marshall]] to [[Seanad \u00c9ireann]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-43920260|title=Sinn F\u00e9in votes help unionist into Irish senate|last=Adair|first=Gordon|date=27 April 2018|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110222065415/http://www.reform.org/TheReformMovement_files/article_files/articles/southernunis.htm 1998 Review of \"Crisis and Decline; the fate of the Southern Unionists\"] by [[Geoffrey Wheatcroft]].</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n===Unionism in Northern Ireland===\n* [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]\n* [[Politics of Northern Ireland]]\n* [[Republic of Ireland\u2013United Kingdom border]]\n* [[Ulster loyalism]]\n* [[Ulster Scots people]]\n\n===Southern unionism===\n* [[Anglo-Irish people]]\n* [[Reform Group (Ireland)]]\n* [[West Brit]]\n\n===Unionism in Great Britain===\n* [[Scotch-Irish Americans]]\n* [[Unionism in England]]\n* [[Unionism in Scotland]]\n* [[Unionism in the United Kingdom]]\n\n===Unionist political parties===\n* [[Conservative Party (UK)]], officially the Conservative and Unionist Party (1830\u2013present)\n* [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (1905\u2013present)\n* [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (1971\u2013present)\n* [[Progressive Unionist Party]] (1978\u2013present)\n* [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP 1993\u2013present)\n* [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] (2007\u2013present)\n\n* [[Liberal Unionist Party]] (1886\u20131912)\n* [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] (1891\u20131922)\n* [[Communist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1941\u20131970)\n* [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] (1949\u20131987)\n* [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party]] (1973\u20131978)\n* [[Volunteer Political Party]] (1974\u20131975)\n* [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]] (1974\u20131981)\n* [[United Ulster Unionist Party]] (1975\u20131984)\n* [[Donegal Progressive Party]] (1970s\u20132000s)\n* [[Ulster Popular Unionist Party]] (1980\u20131995)\n* [[Ulster Democratic Party|Ulster (Loyalist) Democratic Party]] (1982\u20132001)\n* [[UK Unionist Party]] (UKUP 1995\u20132007)\n* [[United Unionist Coalition]] (1998\u20132012)\n* [[Northern Ireland Unionist Party]] (1999\u20132008)\n* [[NI21]] (2013\u20132016)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n===Articles===\n\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070211101921/http://www.obelus.org/index.php?artID=11 Anonymous (2005) Obelus.org \"Ulster Unionism: dead but not gone\"]\n*[https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-dog-that-didnt-bark-southern-unionism-in-pre-and-post-revolutionary-ireland/] \u00d3 Beach\u00e1in, D.

Unionist postcard 1912]]\n'''Unionism in Ireland''' is a political tradition on the island that professes loyalty to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Crown]] and [[Constitution of the United Kingdom]]. The overwhelming sentiment of a once ascendant minority [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant population]], in the decades following [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829) it mobilised to oppose the restoration of an [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish parliament]]. As \"Ulster unionism,\" in the century since [[Partition of Ireland|Partition]] (1921), its commitment has been to the retention within the United Kingdom of the six Ulster counties of [[Northern Ireland]]. Within the framework of a [[Northern Ireland peace process|peace settlement for Northern Ireland]], since 1998 unionists have reconciled to sharing office with [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] in a [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved]] administration, while continuing to rely on the connection with Great Britain to secure their cultural and economic interests.\n\n==Irish Unionism 1800-1904==\n\n===The Act of Union 1800===\n[[File:Battle of Ballynahinch (2).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail from The [[Battle of Ballynahinch]] 1798 by Thomas Robinson. Government Yeomanry prepare to hang a United Irish insurgent, Hugh McCulloch, a grocer.]]\n\nIn the last decades of the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] (1542-1800) [[Protestants]] in public life advanced themselves as \"Irish patriots.\"  Their patriotism focused upon an [[Protestant Ascendancy|Ascendancy]] [[Parliament of Ireland|parliament in Dublin]]. Confined on a narrow franchise to communicants of the ([[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]) [[Church of Ireland]], the parliament denied equal protection and public office both to Protestant \"[[Dissenters]]\" and to the Kingdom's dispossessed [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] majority. The high point of this parliamentary patriotism was the formation during the [[American War of Independence]], of the [[Irish Volunteers (18th century)|Irish Volunteers]] and, as that militia drilled and paraded, the securing in 1782 of the parliament's legislative independence from [[British Privy Council]] in London.\n\nIn [[Presbyterian]] [[Ulster]], where confident in their own numbers Protestants looked upon the Catholic interest with relative equanimity, combinations of tradesmen, merchants, and tenant farmers protested against a parliament that continued in the service of the Kingdom's greatest proprietors and of an executive in [[Dublin Castle]] still appointed, through the office of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], by English ministers.  \nDespairing of reform and emboldened by the [[French Revolution]], these United Irishmen determined that \"if the men of property will not support us, they must fall,\" and that if they were to fall that \"Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter\u201d should unite \"to break the connection with England.\" Such [[Jacobin]] resolve was broken upon the wheel of their [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 uprising]], an insurrection joined in the south by Catholic peasantry.'''\n\nThe British government, that had had to deploy its own forces to suppress the rebellion and to turn back and defeat French intervention, resolved upon a Union. For the chief of Castle executive [[Lord Castlereagh]], the principal merit of a bringing Ireland directly under the British constitution was a resolution of what was ultimately the key issue for the governance of the country, the Catholic question.:<ref>John Bew, Castlereagh. Enlightenment, War and Tyranny. Quercas. London 2012. P. 127</ref>\n<blockquote>Linked with England, the Protestants, feeling less exposed, would be more confident and liberal; and the Catholics would have less inducement to look beyond that indulgence which is consistent with the security of our establishment.<ref>Castlereagh to Sir Laurence Parsons, 28 November 1798, Castlereagh Correspondence, vol. 11, pp. 32-35</ref>\n</blockquote>\nHowever, opposition from within this \"establishment,\" and not least from the King, [[King George III|George III]], obliged Castlereagh to defy what he saw as \"the very logic of the Union.\"<ref>Bew (2012). p.126</ref> The Union bill that, with a generous distribution of titles and emoluments, he put through the Irish Parliament omitted the provision for Catholic emancipation. A separate Irish executive in Dublin was retained, but representation, still wholly Protestant, was transferred to Westminster constituted as the Parliament of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]].\n\nIn decades that followed the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union (1800)]] Protestants of every sectarian persuasion and class reconciled to the loss of an Irish parliament. The legislative union with [[Great Britain]] was seen to not only to occasion their relative prosperity but, as the Roman Catholic majority in Ireland began to stir and gather in a new national movement, also to guarantee their \"liberty.\"\n\n===Catholic Emancipation and the emergence of Nationalist Ireland===\n[[File:Catholic ascendency.jpg|thumb|right|Catholic Emancipation as a world turned upside down: held aloft, Daniel O'Connell promises whigs--symbol of Ascendancy rank and property--for \"ye all.\"]]\nIt took the Union thirty years to deliver on the promise of [[Catholic Emancipation]] (1829)\u2014to admit Catholics to Parliament--and permit an erosion of the Protestant monopoly on position and influence.  An opportunity, had the Union been earlier \"complete,\" to integrate Catholics through their re-emerging propertied and professional classes as a \"dilute minority\" may have passed. As it was, on the morrow of Emancipation it was clear they had chosen \"another route.\" <ref>{{Cite book|title = Modern Ireland 1600-1972t|last = Foster|first = R.

Emancipated within the jurisdiction of the [[Westminster]] parliament, Catholics had to preface principle with the vindication of an historical right\u2014of the Irish as \u201ca people\u201d deserving of a separate representation.  Ireland was re-imagined as a political nation through popular history, balladry, and literature which chronicled the centuries-long resistance of \"the [[Gaels|Gael]]\" and, when all else was lost, of the \"dark days\" of endurance under the [[Penal Laws]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Inventing the Nation: Ireland|last = Comerford|first = R.V.|publisher = Arnold|year = 2003|isbn=0-340-73112-5|location = London}}</ref> Scarcely avoided was the suggestion that in this \"story of the nation\" Irish Protestants were, as [[John Banim]] (the \"[[Walter Scott]] of Ireland\") proposed, \"half-countrymen.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = When God Took Sides: Religion and Identity in Irish History - Unfinished History|last = Elliott|first = Marianne|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2009|isbn=978-0-19-920693-3|location = Oxford|page = 38 }}</ref>\n\nOne response to this imputation of \"foreignness\" to Protestants was inscribed defiantly upon the [[Williamite]] banners of the marching [[Orange Order]]: \"[[Siege of Derry|Derry]], [[Battle of Aughrim|Aughrim]], and the [[Battle of the Boyne|Boyne]],\" \"Sons of Conquerors.\" But short of embracing what Catholics viewed as Ascendancy \"triumphalism,\" the difficulty for Protestants in orientating themselves to the national movement was acute. It was made more so by the reality that in the greater part of country the only element around which the movement could reliably build was the Catholic clergy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=MacDonagh|first=Oliver|title=The Politicisation of the Irish Catholic Bishops 1800-1850 |journal=The Historical Journal|date=1975|volume=18|issue=1|pages=37\u201353|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2638467?seq=1}}</ref>\n\n===Protestant unity and the New Reformation===\n\n[[Image:Protestant Unity.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1899 penny print of Henry Cooke's 1841 speech in \"reply to Daniel O'Connell\"]]\nIn an incident celebrated by unionists, in 1841, disdaining to engage a \"bully . . . the Cock of the North,\" O\u2019Connell refused the challenge of the then Moderator of the Presbyterian General Assembly, [[Henry Cooke (minister)|Henry Cooke]], to debate Repeal in Belfast.\n<blockquote>Look at the town of Belfast.

This was a revivalist movement that owed much to Ulster-Presbyterian ministries in the United States (from where Cooke received his doctorate). The belief it carried in personal empowerment through faith was to lend itself in Ireland to a politically-charged prosperity gospel. ''In The Mystery Solved: or, Ireland's Miseries; the Grand Cause and Cure'', a work that caused a \"sensation\" on its publication in 1852 (a copy was sent to every member of Parliament, and one was \"graciously accepted\" by Queen Victoria),  Dr. Edward Marcus Dill, a \"General  missionary agent\" of the Presbyterian Assembly, argued that the poverty of Catholic Ireland  was rooted, not in a history of political disability, but in a counterfeit faith.<ref>.{{cite web||author=W.

Caricature 1881.]]\nIn December 1885, the [[Liberal Party]] leader [[William Ewart Gladstone]] announced his conversion to a compromise that had been prepared by O\u2019Connell prior to his death in 1847. Ireland would have a measure of \u201chome rule\u201d within the United Kingdom.\n\nUp to, and through, the great starvation, the [[Irish Famine]], of the 1840s, successive governments, Whig and Tory, had maintained a studied indifference to the systemic consequences in Ireland of peasant dispossession and unchecked landlordism. The issues of a low-level agrarian war came to [[Westminster]] in 1852. In a direct challenge to the landed-interest [[Irish Conservative Party]], what the [[Young Ireland]]er Gavan Duffy optimistically described as the \u201c[[Tenant Right League|League of North and South]]\u201d returned 50 tenant-rights MPs. For unionism the more momentous challenge lay in the wake of the [[1867 Reform Act]]. In Great Britain it produced an electorate that no longer identified instinctively with the landed interest. In Ireland, where it more than doubled in size, in 1874 the electorate returned 59 Members for the [[Home Rule League]] who were to sit as the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP). Of these, only two were returned from Ulster (from the border county of Cavan): \"Ulster protestants, as a body, were as strongly opposed to home rule as they had been to repeal.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Making of Modern Ireland 1603-1923|last=Beckett|first=J.C.|publisher=Faber & Faber|year=1966|isbn=0-571-09267-5|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>\n\nThe Home Rule League was led nonetheless by the son of a Church of Ireland rector and an Ulsterman. [[Isaac Butt]] had been seduced from his commitments to the Conservative Party and Orange Order by the failure of the Union to give famine-stricken Cork the relief that he believed would have been given Cornwall. In the British [[House of Commons]] Butt was seconded by another maverick from the north, a Catholic convert, [[Joseph Biggar]]. Biggar led an aggressive form of obstructionism that deliberately courted the judgement that as a body the IPP was \u201cpractically foreign\u201d and \u201cvalued its place in the House only as a means of making itself so-disagreeable as to obtain its release.\u201d<ref>James Bryce, \u201cHow we became Home-Rulers.\u201d ''The Contemporary Review''. Vol. LI. May 1887, pp. 736-756. p.740</ref>\n\nGladstone in his first ministry (1868-1874) attempted conciliation. In [[Disestablishment of the Church of Ireland|1869 the Church of Ireland was disestablished]] and in 1870 a [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Land Act]] acknowledged for the first time a political responsibility for agrarian conditions. But spurred by the collapse of agricultural prices in the [[Long Depression]], the [[Land War]] intensified. From 1879 it was organised by the direct-action [[Irish National Land League]], led by another of Butt's lieutenants (and who, like Butt, bestowed upon the Nationalist movement \"a deceptively ecumenical air\") the southern (albeit half-American) Protestant [[Charles Stewart Parnell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Irish History|last=Duffy|first=Sean|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1997|isbn=0-7171-2479-7|location=Dublin|pages=106}}</ref>  As late as 1881 Gladstone resorted (over a 41-hour [[filibuster]] by IPP) to a Coercion Act allowing for arbitrary arrest and detention in protection of \u201cperson and property.\u201d\n\nThe final and decisive shift in favour of constitutional concessions came in the wake of the [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Third Reform Act of 1884]]. The near-universal admission to the suffrage of male heads of household tripled the electorate in Ireland. The 1885 election returned an IPP of 85 Members (including 17 from Catholic-majority areas of Ulster), marshalled now under the leadership of Parnell. Gladstone, whose Liberals lost all 15 of their Irish seats, was able to form his second ministry only with their Commons support.\n\n===Reaction to Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule Bills===\n[[File:Unionist Convention 1892 (3).jpg|thumb|left|\"God Save the Queen\" \"Erin Go Bragh\" Ulster Unionist Convention, Belfast, 1892]]\nThe [[Government of Ireland Bill 1886|Government of Ireland Bill]] that Gladstone tabled in June 1886 incorporated what he imagined were assurances for Unionism. The 200 or so popularly elected members of the \u201cIrish Legislative Body\u201d would sit in session with 28 [[Peerage of Ireland|Irish Peers]] and a further 75 Members elected on a highly restrictive property franchise. The anticipated result might have been rough nationalist-unionist parity.\n\nWhat was clear to unionists was that Ireland was being put out of the United Kingdom. The \u201cImperial Parliament\u201d in London would retain sovereignty (\u201cdevolving\u201d powers to Dublin) but no Irish representation. What was proposed was a proximate restoration of the constitution of the Kingdom of Ireland as it had existed before 1782\u2014a colonial legislature in Dublin with an executive accountable to London through the Lord Lieutenant. But it was with arrangements for representation in Ireland on terms, and in an era, that unionists feared could only march in one direction--toward majority rule and total separation.\n\nThe alarm among Protestants appeared to surmount all previous distinctions of party or class and, in addition to express fears of \"[[Rome Rule]],\" spoke to their growing material concerns. These were not only those of the existential struggles in the countryside over land and rent. The upper and middle classes found in Britain and the Empire \"a wide range of profitable careers--in the army, in the public services, in commerce--from which they might be shut out if the link between Ireland and Great Britain were weakened or severed.\"<ref>Beckett (1966), pp. 398-399</ref> That same link was critical for all those engaged in the great export industries of the North--textiles, engineering, shipbuilding--for whom the Irish hinterland was less present than Clydeside or the North of England.\n\nFor Protestant workers there was the concern that Home Rule would force accommodation of the growing numbers of Catholics arriving at mill and factory gates from the outlying country and western districts. While the plentiful supply of cheap labour helped attract the English and Scottish capital that employed them, Protestant workers organised to protect \u201ctheir\u201d jobs (a function performed in the skilled trades by the apprenticeship system) and tied housing. The once largely rural Orange Order was given a renewed lease and mandate.<ref>Foster (1988), pp. 389-390</ref> The pattern, in itself, was not unique to Belfast or its satellites. Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and other British centres experiencing heavy Irish immigration developed similar nativist, and even Orange, ward and workplace politics<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Migrants in Modern Britain, 1750\u20131922|last=MacRaild|first=Donald|publisher=Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0-312-22032-7|location=London}}</ref>--to which Irish Unionists made conscious appeal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Irish Unionism 2: Ulster Unionism and the Origins of Northern Ireland 1886-1922|last=Buckland|first=Patrick|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=1973|location=London|pages=13}}</ref>\n\nGladstone's own party was split on Home Rule and the House divided against the measure. People were already battling on the streets when the news reached Belfast. The rumour among unionists was that [[1886 Belfast riots|the rioting]], which took upwards of fifty lives, had been triggered when a group of Catholic navvies, anticipating the Bill's passage, pushed a Protestant out of their dock, warning him that \"neither he nor any of his sort should get leave to work there, or earn a loaf there or any other place.\"<ref>Bardon (2008) p. 408</ref>\n\nIn 1891 Ulster's [[Liberal Unionists]], part of larger Liberal break with Gladstone, entered the [[Irish Unionist Alliance]] and at Westminster took the Conservative whip.\n\nIn 1892, despite bitter division, in which the Catholic hierarchy took a heavy hand, over the personally-compromised leadership of Parnell, the Nationalists were able to help Gladstone to a third ministry. The result was a second Home Rule bill. It was greeted by an Ulster opposition more highly developed and better organised.\n\nA great Ulster Unionist Convention was held in Belfast organised by the Liberal Unionist Thomas Sinclair, in earlier years \"an articulate critic of the Orange Ascendancy.\"<ref>Graham Walker (1996) \"Thomas Sinclair: Presbyterian Liberal Unionist\" ''Unionism in Modern Ireland''. Richard English, Graham Walker eds., Macmillan London. pp. 19-40. p. 20</ref> Speakers and observers dwelt on the diversity of creed, class and party represented among the 12,300 delegates attending. As reported by the [[Northern Whig]] there were \"the old tenant-righters of the 'sixties' . . . the sturdy reformers of Antrim. . . the Unitarians of Down, always progressive in their politics . . . the old-fashioned Tories of the Counties . . . modern Conservatives . . .

The Conservatives formed a new ministry.\n\n===Constructive Unionism===\n[[File:Flag of the Congested Districts Board for Ireland (1893\u20131907).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Congested Districts Board for Ireland]], 1893\u20131907]]\nThe new Prime Minister [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], who had expressed the view that \"free representative institutions\" are best confined to \"people who are of [[Nordic race|Teutonic race]],\" believed his government should \"leave Home Rule sleeping the sleep of the unjust.\"<ref>Bardon (2008). p. 418</ref> Irish Conservatives applauded when in 1887 Dublin Castle was given standing power to suspend [[habeas corpus]]. However, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, his nephew [[Gerald Balfour]], determined upon a \u201cconstructive\u201d course, pursuing reforms intended, as some saw it, to \u201ckill home rule with kindness.\u201d\n\nFor the express purpose of relieving poverty and reducing emigration, in the \u201c[[Congested Districts Board for Ireland|congested districts]]\u201d of the west Balfour initiated a programme not only of public works, but of subsidy for local craft industries. A new Department of Agriculture and Technical instruction broke with the traditions of Irish Boards by announcing that its aim was to \"be in touch with public opinion of the classes whom its work concerns, and to rely largely for its success upon their active assistance and co-operation.\"<ref>Good (1920). p, 210</ref> It supported and encouraged dairy cooperatives, the \"creameries\" that were to be an important institution in the emergence of a new class of independent smallholders.<ref>Bardon (2009) pp. 421-423</ref>\n\nGreater reform followed when, with the support of the splinter [[Liberal Unionist Party]], Salisbury returned to office in 1895. [[Land Acts (Ireland)|The Land Act of 1896]] introduced for the first time the principle of compulsory sale to tenants, through its application was limited to bankrupt estates. \u201cYou would suppose,\u201d said [[Sir Edward Carson]], Dublin barrister and the leading spokesman for Irish Conservatives, \u201cthat the Government were revolutionists verging on Socialism.\u201d.<ref>Good (1920), p. 209</ref> Having been first obliged to surrender their hold on local government (transferred at a stroke in 1898 to democratically-elected councils), the old landlord class had the terms of their retirement fixed by the [[Land Acts (Ireland)|Wyndham Land Act]] of 1903. They had ceased to be an effective social or political influence.\n\n==\"The Ulster Option\" 1905-1920==\n===\"The democracy of Ulster\"===\n[[File:Unionist clubs marching down Donegall Square North, Belfast, 9 April 1912 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Unionist march in Belfast, 9 April 1912]]\nIn 1905 the Ulster Unionist Council was established to represent all shades of unionism in the north. Until then, unionism had largely placed itself behind those of [[Anglo-Irish people|Anglo-Irish]] landed interest that appeared to have the greatest pull at Westminster. The UUC still accorded a degree of precedence to aristocracy. Castlereagh's descendant and former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the [[Charles Stewart Vane-Tempest-Stewart, 6th Marquess of Londonderry|Marquess of Londonderry]] presided over its Executive (and [[Edith Vane-Tempest-Stewart, Marchioness of Londonderry|Lady Londonderry]] over the Ulster Women's Unionist Council). The Council also retained the services of Carson, from 1892 MP for [[Trinity College, Dublin]]. But marshalled by Captain [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], a millionaire director of Belfast's [[Dunville & Co|Dunville Whiskey]], it was northern employers who were undertaking the real political and organisational work.\n\nThe manufacturers and merchants of Belfast and neighbouring industrial districts were, for the most part, of farming and Presbyterian stock and had little natural sympathy for the old landed interest.<ref>Good (1920), p. 227</ref> Crucially, while southern landowners had been politically at war with their tenants, northern employers could count on voting with the majority of their own workforce. For Nationalists this was a matter employers playing \"the Orange card.\" Employers did look to sectarian division to weaken labour protest, although Orangemen could not always be relied upon. In the great [[1907 Belfast Dock strike|Belfast Dock strike of 1907]], the [[syndicalism|syndicalist]] leader [[James Larkin]] was able to engage the support of the [[Independent Orange Order]].<ref>Collins, Peter (1998). \"Larkin, James\", S.J. Connolly, The Oxford Companion to Irish History. Oxford University Press. p. 302</ref> (In 1903 its founder, Tom Sloan, had been the only Unionist MP to vote for the Miners' Eight Hour bill).\n\nLoyalist workers were conscious, and resentful, of the imputation that they were the retainers of \u201cbig-house unionists.\u201d  A manifesto signed in the spring of 1914 by two thousand labour men, on behalf of the only \u201cfully organised and articulate\u201d trade unionists in Ireland, repudiated the suggestion of the radical and socialist press that Ulster was being manipulated by \u201can aristocratic plot.\u201d If Sir Edward Carson led in the battle for the Union it was \u201cbecause we, the workers, the people, the democracy of Ulster, have chosen him.\u201d  Chairman of the Boilermakers\u2019 Society, J. Hanna, insisted that it was as the \u201cfreemen and as members of the greatest democracy in Great Britain and Ireland, the organised trade unions of the country,\u201d that \u201cthey would not have Home Rule.\u201d<ref>John Biggs-Davison, ''The Hand is Red''. London, Johnson. 1973. P. 74</ref>\n\nThe difficulty for nationalists and for those, like [[James Connolly]], who believed that class solidarity should draw workers down the path of national independence, was that without having to break political ranks with their employers, workers were beginning to see that \u201cgreatest democracy\u201d was paying dividends. Thanks to the legislative union, in whose defence Unionists among them effectively voted Conservative, workers in Ireland were able to benefit from the majorities found \u201cacross the water\u201d for labour and social reform-\u2014under the a Liberal-majority government from 1906, for the [[Trade Disputes Act 1906]], for the [[National Insurance Act 1911]] and for the \u201c[[People's Budget]] 1911. \u00a0\n\nThe nationalist cause in the industrial North was not helped by those who suggested that collective bargaining, social security and progressive taxation were principles for which majorities would not be as readily found in a Dublin Parliament. Objecting to an \u201cinefficient and extravagant government . . . which had no parallel in Europe,\u201d ''[[Sinn Fein]]'' President [[Arthur Griffith]] proposed that \u201cimperialism and socialism\u2014forms of the cosmopolitan heresy and in essence one\u2014have offered man the material world. Nationalism has offered him a free soul<ref>\u201dPat Walsh (1994), ''Irish Republicanism and Socialism'', Belfast. Athol Press, p.12</ref> For Ulster workers, as for Ulster employers, there was interest and calculation in a common Unionism.\n\nIn an open letter to U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], in 1918 Edward Carson wrote:<ref>{{Cite book|title = Two Irelands Beyond the Sea: Ulster Unionism and America, 1880-1920|last = Flewelling|first = Lindsey|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2018|isbn = 978-1-78694-045-2|location = Oxford|pages = 73\u201374}}</ref><blockquote>The Ulstermen of to-day, forming as they do the chief industrial community in Ireland, are as devoted adherents to the cause of democratic freedom as were their forefathers in the eighteenth century.

A total of 234,046 women signed the Ulster Women's Declaration; 237,368 men signed the [[Ulster Covenant|Solemn League and Covenant]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Ulster Covenant|last=Gordon|first=Lucy|publisher=Ulster society|year=1989|location=Belfast}}</ref>\n\nUnionist women had been involved in political campaigning from the time of the first Home Rule Bill in 1886. Some were active [[suffragette]]s. [[Isabella Tod]], an anti-Home Rule Liberal and campaigner for girls education, was an early pioneer. In 1873 she founded the Northern Irish branch of the [[National Society for Women's Suffrage]]. Later, while still based in Belfast, this became the [[Irish Women's Suffrage Society]] publishing the weekly ''The Irish Citizen''.<ref>Courtney (2013). pp. 240-241</ref>\n\nNot all IWSS Unionists were impressed by the Women's Declaration. Elizabeth McCracken, a regular contributor to ''The Irish Citizen'' and the [[Belfast News Letter]] noted the failure Unionist women to formulate \"any demand on their own behalf or that of their own sex.\"<ref>History Ireland, Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis, https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/</ref> The Declaration, nonetheless, was a political affirmation of intent by women, organised and publicly staged by women--the Ulster Women's Unionist Council. Founded in January 1911, by 1913, with well over 100,000 members, the UWUC was the largest women's political group in Ireland.\n\nDetermined to \"sink all differences in favour of the Union,\" the UWUC avoided public comment on the suffrage question. But for many women signing the Council's Declaration was a first taste of political involvement. In September 1913 it appeared that the Unionist Council had determined it should not be their last. The Council informed the UWUC that \"the draft articles\" for a Provisional Government to be set up in the event of Home Rule being legislated \"include the franchise for women.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/irish-suffragettes-at-the-time-of-the-home-rule-crisis/|title=Irish Suffragettes at the time of the Home Rule Crisis|accessdate=8 March 2020|author=History Ireland}}</ref> The Irish Parliamentary Party made no such commitment for a Dublin parliament.  In contrast to Ulster Unionists who divided, in 1912 the Nationalists had voted as a block against a \"Conciliation\" Bill that would have conceded the principle of women suffrage, albeit on a highly restrictive property basis.<ref>Burke, Jason (2018), \"Carson's Betrayal of Women?

In 1912 the Prime Minister, [[Herbert Asquith]], introduced the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]]. A more generous dispensation than the earlier bills, it would, for the first time, have given an Irish parliament an accountable executive. It was carried in the Commons by a majority of ten. As expected, it was defeated in the Lords, but as result of the crisis engendered by the opposition of the peers to the 1909 People's Budget the Lords now only had the power of delay. Home Rule would become law in 1914.\n\nFrom the outset there had been discussion of giving \u201can option to Ulster.\u201d In response to the First Home rule Bill in 1886, \u201cRadical Unionists\u201d\u2014Liberals who proposed federalising the relationship between all countries of the United Kingdom\u2014argued that \u201cthe Protestant part of Ulster should receive special treatment . . . on grounds identical with those that support the general contention for Home Rule\u201d <ref>R. W. Dale, \u201cThe Liberal Party and Home Rule,\u201d 1887 784.</ref> In Ulster there was no interest in the federalists\u2019 idea of a Belfast legislature, but the riposte to nationalists remained. In summarising ''The Case Against Home Rule'' (1912),  L. S. Amery argued that against \u201cevery argument that can justify three million Nationalists asserting their national idea over a million Unionists\u201c is \u201cthe stubborn fact that if Irish Nationalism constitutes a nation, then Ulster is a nation too.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson 78</ref>\n\nFaced with the eventual enactment of Home Rule, Carson appeared to press the point. On 28 September 1912, \u2018Ulster Day\u2019 he was the first to sign, in Belfast City Hall, [[Ulster Covenant|Ulster's Solemn League and Covenant]]<ref name=proni>{{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/index/search_the_archives/ulster_covenant/ulster_day.htm|title=The Ulster Covenant: Ulster Day|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=[[PRONI]]}}</ref> binding its signatories \u201cto stand by one another in defending for ourselves and our children our position of equal citizenship in the United Kingdom, and in using all means which may be found necessary to defeat the present [[Conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] to set up a Home Rule Parliament in Ireland.\u201d (The historic reference, widely understood, was to the sixteenth-century [[Covenanters|Scottish Covenants]] that had bound Presbyterians to defend in arms their reformed faith)\n\nIn January 1913, Carson declared for the exclusion of Ulster and called for the enlistment of up to 100,000 Covenanters as drilled and armed [[Ulster Volunteers]]. On September 23rd, the second Ulster Day, he accepted Chairmanship of a Provisional Government, elaborately organised by Craig.  If Home Rule were imposed \u201cwe will be governed as a conquered community and nothing else.\u201d <ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 79.</ref>\n\nFor Carson and for other southern Unionists the object of the gamble on Ulster\u2014with the surety of support from British Conservatives and possibly, following the [[Curragh Mutiny|incident at Curragh]], in the Army\u2014was to out manoeuvre both the Government and the Nationalists, so as to retain Ireland as a whole under the direct authority of the Crown in Westminster. Ulster excluding itself from the jurisdiction of a Dublin Parliament was the threat, but if \u201can option\u201d for Ulster was all that was achieved, it would have been--as Carson later accounted it--a defeat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2016/08/28/edward-carson-no-one-on-earth-is-so-clearly-the-typical-irishman/|title=Edward Carson, \u2018No one on earth is so clearly the \u201ctypical Irishman\u201d\u2018|last=archive.org|website=www.sluggerotoole.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-07}}</ref>\n\nFor Unionists in the North, the integrity of Ireland within the United Kingdom was not an existential issue. With the signing of the Covenant and the creation of the Provisional government, northern Protestants had effectively \"proclaimed themselves a people apart from the rest of Ireland, and decreed the exclusion of Unionists, as well as Nationalists, who had the misfortune to reside on the wrong bank of the Boyne.\u201d The differences in class between the two sections of Unionism were complicated by the unresolved differences of creed. One of the arguments that was now employed behind the scenes for the exclusion of a smaller enclave of six, rather than the full nine, Ulster counties is that it would possess not merely a Protestant but a Presbyterian majority.<ref>Good (1920). pp. 225-226)</ref>\n\nEconomic differences also made for separation. Agricultural Ulster, and Belfast as a distribution centre, might have important links with the south and west of the country. But the major industries, textiles, shipbuilding and engineering brought those they engaged into routine contact, not with Limerick, Cork or even Dublin, but with Glasgow, Liverpool and London. An Irish partition would not involve the potential loss of a valued hinterland, entrep\u00f4t or market.\n\nUltimately, as recalled by the man celebrated for landing German guns for Ulster Volunteers, Major [[Frederick H. Crawford]], the decision on the Ulster Unionist Council was that \u201cwe could not dictate to the rest of Ireland.\u201d Beyond the Protestant pale in Ulster there was simply no hope of rescuing Unionist brethren from the strength of the demand for Home Rule and from the British sympathy it engaged. \n<blockquote>I moved a resolution that in future our policy be confined to Ulster . . . This very naturally caused dismay among the Unionists of the South and West but when we asked them for an alternative they could suggest no alternative.<ref>Frederick H Crawford, Guns for Ulster, Graham and Heslip, Belfast 1947</ref><ref>Biggs Davidson (1973). pp. 71-72</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Partition===\n[[File:Irish UK election 1918.png|thumb|right|The 1918 general election result in Ireland.

The IPP leader [[John Redmond]] insisted that if any part of Ireland was to be excluded from Dublin's jurisdiction it should only be those limited areas in the north-east with clear Unionist majorities.  Carson, still seeking the leverage that might induce Nationalists to settle on terms more conducive to the continued sovereignty of the Crown in Westminster, insisted on a \u201cclean cut\u201d for the whole nine counties of Ulster. If this was done generously, he suggested that Ulster might, in time, \u201ccome in.\u201d  For a few days the conference, in words of Winston Churchill, \u201ctoiled round the muddy byways of Fermanagh and Tyrone\u201d and no amending bill was agreed.<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973). p. 229</ref>\n\nOn August 4th 1914, the United Kingdom declared war on Germany. A few weeks later the Home Rule bill received [[Royal Assent]] but with implementation suspended for the duration of European hostilities. With the issue of exclusion unresolved, leaders on both sides entered into a rival solicitation of Government favour by committing themselves, and their volunteers, to the war effort. Having, on the eve of war, been under growing pressure to set up his Provisional Government, Carson declared that \u201cEngland difficulty is not Ulster\u2019s opportunity . . . We do not seeks to purchase terms by selling our patriotism.\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title =Dividing Ireland: World War One and Partition|last = Hennessey|first = Thomas|publisher = Routledge|year = 1998|location = London|pages = 72}}</ref>\n\nThat, however, was how Redmond's position came to be perceived on the nationalist side.

Acting on their mandate, Sinn F\u00e9in MPs met in Dublin in January 1919 as the [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], the national assembly, of the Republic declared in 1916 and demanded that the \"English garrison\" evacuate. In the six north-east counties the Unionists took 22 out of 29 seats, with  Carson, wary of [[Bolshevism|\"Bolshevik]]\" sedition, having taken the additional precaution of running candidates in Belfast as [[Ulster Unionist Labour Association|Labour Unionists]].\n\nViolence against Catholics in Belfast, driven out of workplaces and attacked in their districts, and a boycott of Belfast goods, accompanied by looting and destruction, in the South, helped consolidate \"real partition, spiritual and voluntary\"<ref>Biggs-Davidson (1973) pp. 99-100</ref> in advance of the constitutional partition. This otherwise uncompromising Republicans recognised was, at least for now, inevitable. In August 1920 [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], President of D\u00e1il, declared in favour of \"giving each county power to vote itself out of the Republic if it so wished.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title =Revolutionary Government in Ireland|last = Mitchell|first = Arthur|publisher = Gill & Macmillan|year = 1995|location = Dublin|isbn=0-7171-2015-5|pages = 310}}</ref>\n\nAs they battled with the Republic in the South and West, the British Government, in the hope of brokering a compromise that might yet hold Ireland within the jurisdiction of the \u201cImperial Parliament,\u201d proceeded with the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]]. This provided for two subordinate parliaments. In Belfast a \u201cNorthern Ireland\u201d parliament would convene for the six rather than nine Ulster counties (in three, Craig conceded, Sinn F\u00e9iners would make government \"absolutely impossible for us\"). The island's remaining twenty-six counties, \"Southern Ireland,\" would be represented in Dublin. In a joint Council, the two parliaments would be free to enter into all-Ireland arrangements.\n\nIn 1921, elections for these parliaments were duly held. But in \"Southern Ireland\" this was for parliament which, by British agreement, would now constitute itself as the D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann of the [[Irish Free State]]. Under the terms of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], the twenty-six counties were to have the \"same constitutional status in the Community of Nations known as the British Empire as the Dominion of [[Canada]].\"<ref> {{cite web|title= The Anglo-Irish Treaty, 6 December 1921|url=http://www.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/politics/docs/ait1921.htm/|accessdate=22 March 2020}}</ref> It was not clear to all parties at the time\u2014civil war ensued\u2014but this was de facto independence.\n\nUnionists in Northern Ireland thus found themselves in the unanticipated and unsought position of having to work a constitutional arrangement that was the \u201cby-product of the desperate attempt by British statesmen\u201d to reconcile \u201cthe determination of the Protestant population of the North to remain firmly and without qualification within the United Kingdom\u201d with the aspirations of the Nationalist majority in Ireland for Irish unity and independence,<ref>{{Cite book|title = Lessons of Ulster|last = Utley|first = T.E.|publisher = J.M.

Belfast, like [[Ottawa]], had a two-chamber [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]], a Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland|Prime Minister]] ([[Sir James Craig]]), and [[the Crown]] represented by a [[Governor of Northern Ireland|Governor]] ([[James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn|the Duke of Abercorn]]) and advised by a [[Privy Council of Northern Ireland|Privy Council]]. All this was suggestive, not a devolved administration within the United Kingdom, but of a state constituted under the Crown outside the direct jurisdiction of the Westminster parliament.\n\nThe impression that Ireland as a whole was being removed from the orbit of Westminster politics was reinforced by refusal of the parties of Government and Opposition to organise, or canvass for votes, in the six counties.<ref>{{Cite book|title =Fatal Influence: The Impact of Ireland on British Politics|last = Mathews|first = Kevin|publisher = University College Dublin Press|year = 2004|location = Dublin|isbn=978-1904558057|pages = 310}}</ref>  The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] were content that [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MPs took their party [[whip]] in the [[House of Commons]] where, by general agreement, matters within the competence of the Belfast Parliament could not be raised.

Despite its broad legislative powers, the Belfast Parliament did not, in any case, have the kinds of tax and spending powers that might have engendered that kind of party competition. For all its [[Queen-in-Parliament|crown-in-parliament]] pretension and, from 1932, the grandeur of its [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Buildings at Stormont]], the Northern Ireland Parliament was \"effectively dependant for supply on the Parliament at Westminster.\"<ref>Biggs-Davison (1973), p. 18</ref> The principal sources of government revenue, income and corporation taxes, customs and excise, were entirely beyond Belfast's control.<ref>{{Cite book |title = The Government of Northern Ireland: Public Finance and Public Services, 1921-1964|last = Lawrence|first = R.J..|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1965|location = Oxford|pages = 40\u201341+}}</ref>\n\nThe one unambiguous remit of the Belfast parliament was precisely that in which the Gladstone Home Rule bills had sought to limit a Dublin parliament: internal \"law and order.\" Unionists argue that these were \"responsibilities thrust upon them\": <blockquote>[U]nionists leaders had no desire to \"dominate\" Catholics in the pursuit of loyalist self-determination. As [[Sir Edward Carson|Lord Carson]] argued in the House of Commons . . ., unionists never asked to govern any Ulster Catholic but were perfectly happy that both Protestants and Catholics should be governed from Westminster. The strongest foundation for the good government of Ulster, he argued, was the fact that Westminster was aloof from the religious and racial distinction of its inhabitants.<ref>Aughey (1995), p. 15</ref></blockquote>\n\nCatholics were a third of the population in the six counties: a minority in four, [[County Antrim|Antrim]], [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Armagh|Armagh]], and a majority in two, [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]]. Carson was apprehensive, fearing that with a separate parliament sectarianism could be the only basis for politics. In 1921 he reminded Craig and other Unionist leaders: \"We used to say that we could not trust an Irish parliament in Dublin to do justice to the Protestant minority. Let us take care that that reproach can no longer be made against your parliament, and from the outset let them see that the Catholic minority have nothing to fear from a Protestant majority.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Dudley Edwards | first = Ruth | title = Biography: Carson by Geoffrey Lewis | newspaper = The Times | date = 29 May 2005 | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article526275.ece |access-date=13 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===On the edge of the Union===\n[[File:USC OrangeLodge1970.jpg|thumb|upright|An Orange Order banner dedicated to the Ulster Special Constabulary. 2007]]\nIn retirement in London Carson confided to the historian [[Charles Petrie (historian)|Sir Charles Petrie]] his disillusionment with Belfast politics: \"I fought to keep Ulster part of the United Kingdom, but Stormont is turning her into a second-class Dominion.\"<ref>Sir Charles Petrie, ''A Historian Looks At His World'' (London: Sedgwick & Jackson, 1972), p. 27.</ref> Yet in the first critical years of the new Northern Ireland administration, Carson had stood with other Unionist leaders in urging measures that were both resented by nationalists and poorly understood or appreciated in Great Britain.\n\nOne of the first act of Northern Ireland legislature was to overturn a British attempt to maximise the representation of a minority-populated \"centre ground.\" In 1919 [[proportional representation]] (PR) had been prescribed for all Irish elections. In the January 1920 urban council elections in Ulster preference voting assisted nationalists to the control of 21 of 45 townships, including [[Omagh]], [[Newry]] and \"what was the greatest blow to Unionist pride\", [[Derry]].<ref>Generally, unionists prefer to use Londonderry, the official name of the city, whereas nationalists prefer the name 'Derry'. Due to this complexity and potential for problems, Wikipedia uses a consensus where ''Derry'' is used to refer to the city and Londonderry the county.</ref>  In Belfast, where under the old [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]] Unionists had taken 52 of 60 council seats, under PR the nationalists were able to take ten, although perhaps \"most disturbing to Carson and his followers\" was the success of twelve labour candidates (ten for the independent [[Belfast Labour Party]]).<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 20</ref>  In the county, and rural district, council elections that followed in June 1920 nationalists took control of two of the six counties (Fermanagh and, for the first time Tyrone) and 36 of the 55 districts.\n\nThe twelve anti-partitionist MPs returned in May 1921 to the fifty-two member Northern parliament refused to take their seats. They joined nationalist councillors, and large numbers of Catholic school officials and teachers, in pledging themselves to Dublin. At the annual [[Parades in Northern Ireland|12th of July Orange celebrations]] Carson denounced those who elected swore allegiance to the Republic and vowed that Ulster would \"tolerate no Sinn F\u00e9in organisation or methods\" within its border. At the same time, he declared that \"real object\" of the independent Labour movement was \"to bring about disunity among our people.\"<ref>Matthews (2004). p. 22</ref>\n\nThe 1922 Local Government Act that restored the winner-take-all voting system also authorised the N.I. Minister of Home Affairs to rearrange local government constituencies. Unionists dispute that this led to a systematic policy of [[gerrymandering|gerrymander]]. In what is generally cited as the most egregious example, Derry, from 1923 a \"nationalist city\" with a Unionist council, they point to the low turnout among a dispirited and abstentionist nationalist electorate, and among Catholics voting to the comparatively strong support for labour candidates.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Londonderry Revisited: A Loyalist Analysis of the Civil Rights Controversy|last = Kingsley|first = Paul|publisher = Belfast Publicationss|year = 1989|location = Belfast|isbn = 0951554905|pages = 19\u201339}}</ref> But a generation later, in 1968 when nationalists were taking to the streets of the city, the veteran Unionist MP and former Northern Ireland Attorney General Edmunnd Warnock advised the then Prime Minister Terence O'Neill that \"If ever a community had a right to demonstrate against a denial of civil rights, Derry is the finest example.\" Warnock confessed to his own role in the \"manipulation of ward boundaries for the sole purpose of retaining unionist control\".

It was an almost entirely Protestant force, an excuse the nationalists alleged for arming Orangemen.

Consistent with the obligation under the Government of Ireland Act to neither establish nor endow a religion, a 1923 Education Act provided that in schools religious instruction would only be permitted after school hours and with parental consent. Lord Londonderry, as Minister of Education, owned that his ambition was mixed Protestant-Catholic education. In a reprise of the reception of Dublin-Castle National Schools proposal a century before, a coalition of Protestant clerics, school principals and Orangemen insisted on the imperative of bible teaching. Craig relented, amending the act in 1925. Meanwhile, the Catholic hierarchy refused to transfer any schools, and would not allow male Catholic student teachers to enrol in a common training college with Protestants or women.<ref> {{cite web|title= Lord Londonderry & Education Reform in 1920s Northern Ireland |author= Neil Fleming |url=http://www.historyireland.com/troubles-in-ni/ni-1920-present/lord-londonderry-education-reform-in-1920s-northern-ireland/|accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref> In the North (as in the South) a pillar of sectarian division, the school-age segregation of Protestants and Catholics, was sustained.\n\nIn looking to the post-war future, the Unionist Government under Basil Brooke ([[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookeborough]]) did make two reform commitments. First, it promised a programme of \"slum clearance\" and public housing construction (in the wake of the [[Belfast Blitz]] the authorities acknowledged that much of the housing stock had been \"uninhabitable\" before the war). Second, the Government accepted an offer from London--understood as a reward for the province's wartime service--to match the parity in taxation between Northern Ireland and Great Britain with parity in the services delivered. What Northern Ireland might loose in autonomy, it was going to gain in a closer, more equal, Union. Since the Belfast government could not in any case control the tax implications, it seemed that they could only welcome British financial support for the public spending that would follow.<ref>{{Cite book |title = History of Northern Ireland|last = Buckland|first = Patrick|publisher =Gill & Macmillan|year = 1981|location = Dublin|isbn = 9780717110698|pages = 83}}</ref>\n\nBy the 1960s Unionism was administering something at odds with the conservatism of those to whom leadership had been conceded in the resistance to Irish Home Rule. Under the impetus of the [[Labour Government 1945-1951|post-War Labour government]] in Britain, and thanks to the generosity of British exchequer, Northern Ireland had emerged with an advanced [[Welfare state in the United Kingdom|welfare state]]. The Education Act (NI), 1947, \"revolutionised access\" to secondary and further education. Catholic grant-aided schools were fully funded, and a school transfer test (the [[Eleven Plus]]) enabled qualifying students to receive a grammar-school education irrespective of background or circumstances. Health-care provision was expanded and re-organised on the model of the [[National Health Service]] in Great Britain to ensure universal access. The Victorian-era [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], sustained after 1921, was replaced with a comprehensive system of social-security.

A scion of a landed family (brought Up partly in [[Abyssinia]] and partly at [[Eton]]) and, like all contenders for his position, a member of the [[Orange Order]], O'Neill was the unlikely champion of a technocratic approach to government that was impatient with what he decried as \"ancient hatreds.\"<ref>Cole John, in Introduction to {{Cite book |title = Ulster at the Crossroads|last = O'Neill|first = Terence|publisher = Faber & Faber|year = 1969|location = London|pages = 11}}</ref> \n\nRecognising the decline of the province's Victorian-era industries, under O'Neill the Stormont administration intensified its efforts to attract outside capital. Investment in new infrastructure, training schemes coordinated with trade unions, and direct grants succeeded in attracting American, British and continental firms (some of these introducing into the one time [[linenopolis]] artificial fibres). In its own terms, the strategy was a success: the level of manufacturing employment was better than sustained. Yet Protestant workers and local Unionist leadership were unsettled. Unlike the established family firms and skilled-trades apprenticeships that had  been \"a backbone of unionism and protestant privilege,\" the new companies readily employed Catholics and women.<ref>Wichert (1981). pp. 87-89</ref> \n\nUnionist unease was particularly acute in Derry and the west.<ref>{{Cite book |title =Ireland Since 1939, the Persistence of Conflict|last = Patterson|first = Henry|publisher = Penguin|year = 2006|location = Dublin|isbn = 978-1844881048|pages = 126-129}}</ref> Already in 1956 O'Neill's predecessor, [[Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough|Lord Brookborough]], had received a delegation \"on industries\" from Derry Unionists \"anxious that we not get an invasion from the other side.\"<ref>Minute prepared for meeting with the Prime Minister, 13 September 1956, Public Records Office Northern Ireland, PRONI Brookeborough Papers, 5/95/10</ref> \nWhen Derry lost out to Coleraine for siting of the [[Ulster University|New University of Ulster]], and to [[Lurgan]] and [[Portadown]] for [[Craigavon|a new urban-industrial development]], some \"from the other side\" suspected a wider conspiracy. Speaking to Labour MPs in London, John Hume suggested that \"the plan\" was \"to develop the strongly Unionist-Belfast-Coleraine-Portadown triangle and to cause a migration from West to East Ulster, redistributing and scattering the minority to that the Unionist Party will not only maintain but strengthen its position.\"<ref>''Derry Journal'', 6 August 1965, cited in Kingsley (1989) pp. 98-99</ref>\n\nHume, a teacher from Derry, presented himself as a spokesman for an emerging \"third force\": a \"generation of younger Catholics in the North\" frustrated with a \"flags and slogans\" nationalism whose seeming indifference to \"the general welfare of Northern Ireland\" had made \"the task of Unionist ascendancy simpler.\" Determined to engage the \"great social problems of housing, unemployment and emigration\", these new \"political wanderers\" were willing to acknowledge that \"the Protestant tradition in the North is as strong and as legitimate\" as their own (if \"a man wishes Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom [that] does not necessarily make him a bigot or a discriminator\") and that Irish unity, \"if it is to come,\" could be achieved only \"by the will of the Northern majority.\"<ref>John Hume (1964), \"The Northern Catholic I\", ''The Irish Times'' (May 18 ), cited in part in Kingsley (1989) pp. 121-123</ref> Although they appeared to meet Unionists half way, Hume and those who joined him in what he proposed would be \"the emergence of normal politics\" presented the Unionist government with a new challenge. Drawing on the struggle for black equality in the United States, they spoke a language of universal rights that had an international resonance far beyond that of the particularist claims of Irish nationalism. \n\nSince 1964, the [[Campaign for Social Justice]] had been collating and publicising evidence of discrimination in employment and housing. From April 1967 the cause was taken up by the Belfast-based [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]]. Seeking to \"challenge . . . by more vigorous action than Parliamentary questions and newspaper controversy,\" NICRA decided to carry out a programme of marches.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Belfast and Derry in Revolt: a New History of the Start of the Troubles|last1 = Prince|first1 = Simon|last2 = Warner|first2 = Geoffrey|publisher = Irish Academic Press|year = 2019|location = New Bridge, Ireland|isbn = 9781788550932|pages = 34}}</ref>\n\n\"Resembling a traditional nationalist parade\" (complete with renditions of [[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann|The Soldiers Song]]), the first march sponsored by NICRA in August 1968 into [[Dungannon]] went off comparatively peacefully.

Irish commemorative postage stamp, 2015]]O'Neill had not disguised an ambition to bring the politics as well as the economy of Northern Ireland \"into the twentieth century.\" In January 1965, at O'Neill personal invitation, the ''[[taoiseach]]'' [[Sean Lemass]] (whose government was pursuing a similar \"modernising\" agenda in the South) made an unheralded visit to Stormont. After O'Neill reciprocated with a visit to Dublin, the Nationalists were persuaded, for the first time, to assume the role at Stormont of [[Her Majesty's Opposition]]. With this and other conciliatory gestures (unprecedented visits to a Catholic hospitals and schools, flying the Union flag at half mast for the death of [[Pope John XXIII]]) O'Neill incurred the wrath of those he understood as \"self-styled 'loyalists' who see moderation as treason, and decency as weakness,\"<ref>O'Neill (1969), p. 123</ref> among these the Reverend [[Ian Paisley]]. \n\nAs Moderator of his own [[Free Presbyterian Church]], and at a time when he believed mainline presbyteries were being led down a \"Roman road\" by the [[Irish Council of Churches]], Paisley saw himself treading in the path of the \"greatest son\" of [[Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Irish Presbyterianism]], Dr. [[Henry Cooke]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/revivalist/1980/Rev80mar.htm/|title=Exit Dr. Craig the Evangelical - Enter Dr. Craig the Ecumenical|website=ianpaisley.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>  Like Cooke, Paisley was alert to [[ecumenicism]] \"both political and ecclesiastical.\" After the Lemass meeting, Paisely announced that \"the Ecumenists . . . are selling us out. Every Ulster Protestant must unflinchingly resist these leaders and let it be known in no uncertain manner that they will not sit idly by as these modern [[Robert Lundy|Lundies]] pursue their policy of treachery.\" Paisley had his own ideas of a \"third force\" in Ulster politics.

There was to be a needs-based points system for public housing; an ombudsman to investigate citizen grievances; universal franchise in council elections (\"One man, one vote\"); and The Londonderry Corporation was suspended and replaced by Development Commission. The Special Powers Act was to be reviewed. \n\nAt a [[Downing Street]] summit on 4 November, [[Harold Wilson]] had warned O'Neill that his government could not \"tolerate a situation in which the liberalising trend was being retarded rather than accelerate,\" and that if that were the case they might \"feel compelled to propose a radical course involving the complete liquidation of all financial agreement with Northern Ireland.\" The British Prime Minister muttered darkly about how, with British subsidy, the major Belfast employers, [[Shorts]], the aircraft manufacturer, and [[Harland and Wolff]], the shipyard, \"had become a kind of soup kitchen.\"<ref>quoted in Prince and Warner (2019), p. 99</ref>\n\nWith members of his cabinet urging him to call Wilson's \"bluff,\" and facing a [[Backbencher]] motion of no-confidence, in January 1969 O'Neill called a [[1969 Northern Ireland general election| general election]]. Having reminded his television audience that under the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] \"the supreme authority of the Parliament of the United Kingdom [remained] unaffected and undiminished over all persons, matters and things\" in Northern Ireland, O'Neill employed the talking points supplied by Wilson. \n<blockquote>I make no apology for the financial and economic support we have received from Britain. As a part of the United Kingdom we have always considered this to be our right. But we cannot be a part of the United Kingdom merely when it suits us. And those who talk so glibly about acts of impoverished defiance do not know or care what is at stake. Your job if you are a worker at Shorts or Harland and Wolff; your subsidies if you are a farmer; your pension if you are retired; all these aspects of our life, and many others depend on support from Britain.

This rights-based perspective drew on what, internationally, proved to be the most compelling account of a conflict that over thirty years took more than 3,600 lives, and injured and bereaved many thousands more. This places at the heart of the conflict the movement for the \"civil rights of the Catholic/Nationalist community.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil Rights and Peace Agreements |last=Bell |first=Chirstine|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=33}}</ref> It is the belief that many in that community came to support or acquiesce in the Republican return to \"physical force\" in 1970-71 because, in the words of [[Eamonn McCann]], the notion that it was possible to achieve full citizenship within the North \"was beaten out of people's heads by the cops and their semi-official auxiliaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=McCann: War and Peace in Northern Ireland |last=McCann |first=Eamonn |year=1998 |publisher=Hot Press Books |location=Dublin|page=145}}</ref><ref>See also {{Cite book|title=From Civil Rights to Armalites: Derry and the Birth of the Irish Troubles |last=) Dochtartaigh |first=Nail|year=1997|publisher=Cork University Press |location=Cork}} </ref> \n\nAs an account of The Troubles, this is consistent with the broad support that the two main nationalist parties expressed for the provision in the Agreement for a possible Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland.

Through the polemic of civil rights those who wished to pursue careers in law, public administration and elective office found release from the self-denying nationalist ordinances of non-recognition and abstention. They could represent themselves \"as people who were heroically breaking down the barriers of discrimination: the promoters of Catholic group interests rather than traitors to the cause.\" \"The political necessity to find a way to get the Catholic middle class into positions of influence,\" Kingsley argues, \"meant that the discrimination argument had to be brought to the fore\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 125</ref>\n\nIf not from the outset, then by the summer of 1968 as republicans and left-wing militants took the initiative, \"civil rights leaders\" also came to realise the ability of their campaign \"to convince the British government of the moral superiority of the Catholics position\", and to \"win changed which would be of symbolic importance.\" These in turn would \"undermine Unionist self-confidence, and open the way for further demands\".<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 137</ref> On the street this was the calculation that urged a strategy of tension: provoking violent reactions from an ill-prepared police force and the \"entirely predictable\" and--Kingsley and other unionist commentators<ref>Gregory Campbell (2018), \"Working-class protestants feared what civil rights movement would become\", ''News Letter'', 5 October. https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/gregory-campbell-working-class-protestants-feared-what-civil-rights-movement-would-become-1-8657612</ref> allow--\"ill disciplined\" and \"ferocious\", intrusions into the picture of Protestant mobs, ever anxious to lend the authorities a hand in teaching \"the rebels\" a lesson. If inadvertently, the civil-rights agitation fostered the perceptions of deteriorating security and legitimacy that contributed not only to the introduction of British troops (August 1969) but also, over the course of 1970-71, to the ascendancy within IRA-Sinn F\u00e9in of an ultra-nationalist [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|\"Provisional\" wing]] committed to a return to republicanism's \"physical force\" tradition.<ref>Kingsley (1994), p. 172-198</ref><ref>See also Nelson McCausland (2018), \"Why unionists must ensure that the true origins of the civil rights movement are not forgotten\".

They depended on their capacities and strength of political will alone to ensure Northern Ireland remained a part of the Union. What ensued was a dialectic of stubborn self-righteousness within Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist. It was sponsored on the one hand by a British government equivocal about the integrity of its own state, thereby encouraging unionist intolerance founded on insecurity; and an Irish government hypocritically and irresponsibly playing the [[irridentism|irredentist]] card, thereby encouraging Catholic alienation from the state and helping to provoke those very features of the Stormont regime which it smugly condemned.<ref>Aughey (1995), pp. 9-10</ref></blockquote>\n\nBritish equivocation, in this view, proved disastrous when the tensions to which it had contributed to in Northern Ireland finally exploded. Had the British Government been willing from 1968/69 to act on the proposition that Northern Ireland is an integral part of the United Kingdom, their response would have been \"fundamentally different.\" If they had thought there were social and political grievances which were remediable by law, it would have been seen as the business of Parliament in Westminster to act. But acts of rebellion would have been suppressed and punished as such with the full authority and force of the state. At no point would the policy have been one of containment and negotiation. <blockquote>It is scarcely conceivable . . . that in a state of civil disturbance in Britain large parts of Birmingham or Manchester would have been allowed for months on to become rebel enclaves to which the police and the army were denied access. It would have been quite incredible also that, at a time when the lawful authorities still had overwhelming force at their disposal, the leaders of a rebellion in Warwickshire or Lancashire would have been given safe conducts to London to discuss conditions of peace.<ref>Utley (1975), pp. 15-16</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe example of [[Free Derry]] was replicated in other nationalist neighbourhoods both in Derry and in Belfast.

It articulated what were to be the enduring principles of the British approach to a settlement. <blockquote>It is a fact that an element of the minority in Northern Ireland has hitherto seen itself as simply part of the wider Irish community. The problem of accommodating that minority within the political of Northern Ireland has to some extent been an aspect of a wider problem within Ireland as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore clearly desirable that any new arrangements for Northern Ireland should, whilst meeting the wishes of Northern Ireland and Great Britain, be so far as possible acceptable to accepted by the Republic of Ireland.\n\nNorthern Ireland must and will remain part of the United Kingdom for as long as that is the wish of a majority of the people, but that status does not preclude the necessary taking into account of what has been described in this paper as the 'Irish Dimension.'\n\nA Northern Ireland assembly or authority must be capable of involving all its members constructively in way which satisfy them and hose they represent that the whole community has a part to pay in the government of the Province. ...[T]here are strong arguments that the objective of real participation should be achieved by giving minority interests a share in the exercise of executive power ...<ref>{{cite book|last=Northern Ireland Office|year=1972|title=Green Paper: The Future of Northern Ireland|pages=140|location=London|publisher= HMSO|}} quoted in Kingsley (1989), pp. 230-231</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn June 1973 [[Proportional Representation|PR]] elections were held for an Assembly. Following negotiations at Sunningdale in England, attended by the Dublin government, on 1 January 1974 the former Unionist prime minister Brian Faulkner agreed to form an Executive in coalition with the SDLP and the smaller \"cross-community\" [[Alliance Party]]. Faulkner's later successor as party leader, [[James Molyneaux]], argued that the difficulty for most unionists  was not an arrangement in which \"Protestants and Catholics must consent\"--that \"would be comparatively simple.\" It was that, despite a promise not share power with parties \"whose ''primary'' aim is a united Ireland\",<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first= Barry|year=1984|title=John Hume: Statesman of the Troubles|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=9780856403170|pages=140}}</ref> Faulkner had committed them to agreement with \"Republican Catholics\" <ref>Interview with James Molyneaux, 18 May 1982 quoted in {{cite book|last=O'Malley|first= Padraig |year=1983|title=The Uncivil Wars: Ireland Today|pages=17, 26, 39|location=Boston|publisher= Houghton Mifflin|isbn=039534414X}}</ref> \n\nHaving drawn on both the [[Republican Labour Party|Republican]], and [[Northern Ireland Labour Party|Northern Ireland, Labour]] parties, and with a commitment to \"accommodate progressive Protestants,\"  the SDLP had announced themselves as something more than nationalist or republican party.<ref>{{cite book|last=Devlin|first= Paddy|year=1993|title=Straight Left: an Autobiography|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|isbn=0856405140|pages=191}}</ref> But with PIRA continuing to draw on fury over internment and Bloody Sunday, Eamonn McCann notes that \"in order to sell the deal to the Catholic community the SDLP had to present it not just as a means of expressing its aspiration towards a united Ireland but a means of achieving it\".<ref>McCann (1980), p. 141</ref> The new Health and Social Service Minister, [[Paddy Devlin]], conceded that \"all other issues were governed\" by a drive to \"get all-Ireland institutions established\" that would \"produce the dynamic that would lead ultimately to an agreed united Ireland.\"<ref>Devlin, p. 205</ref> \n\nThe [[Sunningdale Agreement]] envisaged a Council of Ireland comprising, with equal delegations from Dublin and Belfast, a Council of Ministers with \"executive and harmonising functions\" and a Consultative Assembly with \"advisory and review functions.\" As they would only have a plurality of representation on the Northern side, these created the possibility of Unionists being manoeuvred into a minority position. \"In retrospect\", Devlin regretted his party had not \"adopted a two stage approach, by allowing power sharing at Stormont to establish itself\",<ref>Devlin, p. 252</ref> but by the time he and his colleagues recognised the damage they had caused to Faulkner's position by prioritising the \"Irish Dimension\" it was too late. \n\nWithin a week of taking office as First Minister, opposition to the Sunningdale proposals forced Faulkner to resign as UUP leader. In a [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|surprise Westminster election]] at the end of February, his new pro-Agreement grouping, the [[Unionist Party of Northern Ireland]], was rolled over by a [[United Ulster Unionist Coalition]] in which the bulk of his old party stood with William Craig's [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party|Ulster Vanguard]] and Paisley's new electoral vehicle, the [[Democratic Unionist Party|Democratic Unionists]]. Arguing that they had deprived Faulkner of any semblance of a mandate, the victors called for new Assembly elections. \n\nWhen on 14 May the Assembly defeated a motion rejecting the Sunningdale Agreement, Harry Murray, the shipyard convener for the [[Ulster Workers' Council]] (UWC), a loyalist labour coalition, announced a general strike. Within two weeks the UWC, supported by the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and UVF paramilitaries, had an effective stranglehold on energy supplies.<ref>{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Don|year=1994|title=Fourteen May Days:\nThe Inside Story of the Loyalist Strike of 1974|location=Dublin|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|isbn=0717121771}}</ref> Concessions sought by Faulkner were blocked by the SDLP.

From the UUP's James Molyneaux there were the familiar objections to \"something very far removed from straightforward democracy\" and which could give republicans an effective \"veto.\"  But with Paisley calling on unionists not to \"lose sight\" of an opportunity for the \"Ulster people\" to \"freely elect their own Assembly and to begin to bring Direct Rule to account\", there was not blanket rejection.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 372-373</ref> That was to come from nationalists.\n\nJohn Hume dismissed the initiative as \"insulting.\" Not only did it imply, with the 70 percent hurdle, a very much higher degree of unionist unanimity and consent than was required in 1973, it suggested that, for the present at least, the Irish Dimension\" would have adequate \"institutional expression\" in continuing \"intergovernmental\" exchanges with Dublin--then at a low point following the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|PIRA Hunger Strike]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|year=2003|title= 'Margaret Thatcher, Volume Two: The Iron Lady|location=London|publisher= Jonathan Cape|pages=426}}</ref> Seconded by the Dublin government, SDLP insisted that without of \"a very strong and positive and concrete expression of the Irish identity\" the proposals were unworkable.<ref>O'Mally (1983), pp. 368-369</ref> \n\nThree years later, London appeared to reverse tack. The Thatcher government chose to give positive expression to the Irish Dimension ''in advance'' of agreement on devolution. With the [[Taoiseach|Irish Taoiseach]], [[Garret FitzGerald]] Thatcher signed an agreement that, for the first time, gave Dublin a formal consultative role in Northern Ireland and in matters beyond security cooperation. An [[British\u2013Irish Intergovernmental Conference|Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference]] would invite the Irish government to \"put forward views on proposals\" for major legislation concerning Northern Ireland, and this Conference would have a permanent [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]], including officials from the Republic's [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]], quartered in Northern Ireland itself.\n\nThe possibility, in the wake of the Hunger Strike, of deflecting criticism not only from the Republic but also from the United States was part of the British calculation<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bew|first1=Paul|last2=Patterson|first2=Henry|year=1985|title= The British State and the Ulster Crisis: From Wilson to Thatcher|location=London|publisher= Verso Books|isbn=978-0860918158|pages=112}}</ref><ref>Wichert (1991), pp. 194-195.</ref> But both in London and in Dublin, where John Hume was closely advising Fitzgerald,<ref>{{cite book|last=McKitrick|first=David|year=1993|title= Dispatches from Belfast|location=Belfast|publisher= Blackstaff Press|pages=9}}</ref> it was anticipated that the Agreement would intensify pressure on unionists to climb down from a position of \"simple majority rule.\" Proposals from The Irish government would be entertained only on \"matters [that] are not the responsibility of a devolved administration in Northern Ireland.\" If unionists wished to halt a forward roll toward joint sovereignty, the suggestion was that they would have to think again as to how nationalists could be accommodated at Stormont. \n\nThe unionist reaction, Thatcher recalled in her memoirs, was \"worse than anyone had predicted to me\".<ref>Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (London: HarperCollins, 1993), p. 403.</ref> The [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP) led an \"Ulster says No\"  campaign against the Agreement, that included strikes, [[civil disobedience]] and a mass resignation of unionist MPs from Westminster and suspensions of district council meetings.<ref name=aia>[http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm Anglo-Irish Agreement \u2013 Chronology of Events] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206111841/http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/aia/chron.htm |date=1 April 2020}}.

In 1912 Ulster unionists had the Conservatives' fulsome support. Standing beside Carson the Tory leader [[Andrew Bonar Law]] declared  \u201cI can imagine no lengths of resistance to which Ulster can go in which I would not be prepared to support her.\u201d Now unionists were facing a Conservative government imposition, and a Westminster Labour opposition committed to Irish unity. With no obvious political leverage and possibly to preempt initiative passing to the loyalist paramilitaries, in November 1986 Paisley (not for the first time) announced his own \"third force\": the [[Ulster Resistance]] Movement (URM) who would \"take direct action as and when required.\" Recruitment rallies were held in towns across Northern Ireland and thousands were said to have joined. Despite importing arms, some of which were passed on to the UVF and UDA, for the URM the call for \"action\" never came.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ian Paisley death: He was lauded and reviled ... but a

Party]] led by [[Arlene Foster]], followed by the more moderate [[Ulster Unionist Party]] led by [[Robin Swann]]. Both parties are active across [[Northern Ireland]]. On a smaller level, the [[Progressive Unionist Party]], which is the political wing of the [[Ulster Volunteer Force (1966)|Ulster Volunteer Force]] (UVF) paramilitary group, attracts some support in the greater Belfast area. [[Traditional Unionist Voice]] is opposed to the current constitutional arrangements in Northern Ireland following the [[Belfast Agreement]] and [[St Andrews Agreement]]. The pluralist [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] is currently allied to the Ulster Unionist Party. While the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] supports the status quo position of Northern Ireland, it does not define itself as Unionist.\n\nModerate unionists who support the principle of [[Equal Citizenship]] between Northern Ireland and Great Britain have campaigned for mainstream British political parties to organise and contest elections in Northern Ireland. Equal citizenship pressure groups have included the [[Campaign for Equal Citizenship]] (CEC), [[Labour Representation Campaign]], [[Democracy Now (UK pressure group)|Democracy Now]] and, currently, [[Labour - Federation of Labour Groups]]. Momentum for this concept picked up after the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Party Conference voted in favour of working in Northern Ireland in 1989. No Conservative has been elected in Northern Ireland since the 1997 local government elections.<ref>{{cite web |author=Anne Whyte |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/lgnorthdown.htm |title=North Down council results 1997 |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |accessdate=26 September 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828044031/http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/lgnorthdown.htm |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nUnder legal pressure from local trade unionists, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] accepted members from Northern Ireland in October 2002<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/uk_news/northern_ireland/3480575.stm | work=BBC News | title=Labour NI recruits on agenda | date=12 February 2004 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308074625/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/uk_news/northern_ireland/3480575.stm | archivedate=8 March 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and in September 2006 agreed to organise through a forum.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/uk_news/northern_ireland/5384716.stm | work=BBC News | title=Labour agrees to organise in NI | date=27 September 2006 | url-status=live | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308074622/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/uk_news/northern_ireland/5384716.stm | archivedate=8 March 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] have a branch in Northern Ireland but do not contest elections, but are affiliated with the Alliance Party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libdems.org.uk/party/people/inyourarea.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061016185300/http://www.libdems.org.uk/party/people/inyourarea.html |archivedate=16 October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nPro-union parties and independents contest elections and represent their constituents at a number of different levels.

However, a significant number of Protestants have adhered to the nationalist cause, and likewise with Catholics and unionism. These phenomena continue to exist in Northern Ireland.\n\nBoth unionism and nationalism have had sectarian and anti-sectarian elements. While nationalism has had a number of Protestant leaders (for instance, [[Henry Grattan]], [[Theobald Wolfe Tone]], [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and [[Douglas Hyde]]), unionism was invariably always led by Protestant leaders and politicians. Prior to a decades-long ban, Catholics had been allowed to be members of the UUP as recently as the 1920s, including [[Denis Henry]] (the first [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]]), who was a member of the UUP from its foundation in 1905 and a UUP MP for [[South Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|South Londonderry]].

However, a strong decline in the Catholic birthrate may slow down or even reverse the growth in the Catholic population (which may in turn be balanced by an increased rate of emigration of young Protestants, often to study and work in Great Britain). Recent influxes of immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe, are also having a significant effect on the demographic balance, although how many choose to reside permanently in Northern Ireland or take an interest in the political scene remains to be seen.\n\n===Ties to Unionism in Scotland===\nThere is some degree of social and political co-operation between some [[Unionism in Scotland|Scottish unionists]] and Northern Irish unionists, due to their similar aims of maintaining the unity of their [[Countries of the United Kingdom|constituent country]] with the United Kingdom. For example, the [[Orange Order]] parades in Orange Walks in Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, many unionists in Scotland shy away from connections to unionism in Ireland in order not to endorse any side of a largely sectarian conflict. This brand of unionism is largely concentrated in the [[Central Belt]] and west of Scotland. [[Loyalist]]s in Scotland are seen as a militant or extreme branch of [[British unionism|unionism]]. Orangism in west and central Scotland, and opposition to it by [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]] in Scotland, can be explained as a result of the large amount of immigration from the Republic and Northern Ireland.\n\nSongs and symbols of unionism, particularly of the Northern Irish variety, are used by many supporters of [[Rangers F.C.]], a football club based in [[Glasgow]]. Both Rangers and their longtime rival [[Celtic F.C.]], which has Irish Roman Catholic roots, have a reputation for [[sectarian]] clashes and bitter opposition to each other, frequently characterised by religious taunts, chants and other provocations. This behaviour by some supporters is condemned by the management of the clubs. Despite the symbols associated with the clubs, not all Rangers supporters can be automatically classified as unionists, nor all Celtic supporters as nationalists. For example, there were Celtic supporters of the \"No Thanks\" campaign for the 2014 independence referendum and Rangers supporters of the \"Yes Scotland\" campaign- despite Celtic FC having nationalist origins and Rangers FC having unionist origins. There was found to be no link between support of left and right-wing parties at general elections for Rangers or Celtic fans either.\n\n==Unionists in southern Ireland 1891\u20131922 {{anchor|Irish unionism}}==\n\n{{main|Irish Unionist Alliance#Southern Unionists}}\n\nAfter 1890, and particularly during the period from the start of the [[First World War]] to the mid-1920s, the number of Unionists in what is now the [[Republic of Ireland]] declined to a point where their numbers were widely regarded as almost insignificant.<ref>McDowell, R.B. ''Crisis and Decline: The Fate of the Southern Unionists''. The Lilliput Press (1998).</ref> This is attributed to a number of factors:\n* [[Land reform]] from the 1870s to the 1900s, arranged by the [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]]. This broke up many of the large Protestant-owned estates, many of whose former owners chose in the 1920s to use their compensation money to settle in Britain, often in other estates that they owned there.\n* The disestablishment of the [[Church of Ireland]] in 1871. This led the Church to sell many of its properties, in the process laying off many Protestant workers who subsequently moved away.\n* The [[Irish War of Independence]] and its aftermath. During the War, some elements of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) allegedly conducted a campaign of murder and [[ethnic cleansing]] against Unionists in parts of the country such as Cork. Historians disagree as to whether such murders were isolated incidents or parts of a wider organised campaign.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Attacks continued in the 1920s against many Unionists who had assisted the British in the War, and in the process 300 historic homes were burned. Such attacks were said to be reprisals for the British forces' destruction of the homes and property of [[Irish republicanism|republicans]], actual or suspected.\n* Emigration. Large numbers of Unionists left Ireland (voluntarily or otherwise) in the years before and after independence, mainly for [[Northern Ireland]], Great Britain and Canada.\n* Assimilation. Many of the Unionists who remained [[cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to some extent into the majority nationalist culture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} This was encouraged by the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] government, and was largely accepted with resignation. The process was accelerated by the pro-Free State stance taken by most Unionists in the [[Irish Civil War]]. The process of assimilation had begun prior to Irish independence, with a number of [[Protestant Nationalist]]s playing leading roles in the [[Irish nationalist]] and [[Gaelic revival]] movements.\n* Intermarriage and the ''Ne Temere'' decree. Unionists were and are {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} largely Protestant, and in many mixed households the children were brought up as Catholics, often because of family or community pressure and the 1908 papal ''[[Ne Temere]]'' decree. There was also a high number of single, unmarried female Unionists in the aftermath of World War I who could not find Protestant husbands.<ref>See Bence-Jones, Mark ''Twilight of the Ascendancy\" Constable, London 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-09-472350-4}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]] (1938\u20131945) was Protestant, though only two senior Irish politicians attended his Church of Ireland funeral; the Catholic members of the government had to wait on the pavement near the Church to be compliant with [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]].\n\nSome Unionists in the south simply adapted and began to associate themselves with the new southern Irish regime of [[Cumann na nGaedheal]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} On 19 January 1922, leading Unionists held a meeting and unanimously decided to support the Free State government.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Many gained appointment to the Free State's Senate, including the [[Windham Wyndham-Quin, 4th Earl of Dunraven and Mount-Earl|4th Earl of Dunraven]] and [[Thomas Westropp Bennett]]. Several generations of one Unionist political family, the Dockrells, won election as [[Teachta D\u00e1la]] (TDs). The Dublin borough of [[Rathmines]] had a unionist majority up to the late 1920s, when a local government re-organisation abolished all Dublin borough councils. Later, the Earl of Granard and the Provost of [[Trinity College Dublin]] gained appointment to the President of Ireland's advisory body, the [[Council of State]].
