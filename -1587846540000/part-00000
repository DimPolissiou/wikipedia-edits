While there, he made notes of a peculiar black rock with greenish coloring, and spent several weeks estimating the extent of the [[gold]] and [[copper]] deposits. In 1939, he filed a report about the ''Ertsberg'' (Dutch for \"ore mountain\"). He was working for Nederlandsche Nieuw Guinea Petroleum Maatschappij (NNGPM), an exploration company formed by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] in 1935, with 40% [[Standard Vacuum Oil Company]] interest and 20% Far Pacific investments ([[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] subsidiary).\n\nIn March 1959, the ''[[New York Times]]'' published an article revealing the Dutch were searching for the mountain source of alluvial gold which had been flowing into the [[Arafura Sea]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Parrots|first1=Lindesay|title=Dutch to explore New Guinea area - Remote Section of Disputed Territory Will Be Object of Intensive Research|url=http://wpik.org/Src/NYT/19590306newExplor.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2017|work=New York Times|date=6 March 1959|page=8}}</ref> Geologist [[Forbes Wilson]], working for the Freeport mining company in August 1959 after reading Dozy's 1936 report, immediately prepared to explore the Ertsberg site. In 1960 the expedition, led by Forbes Wilson and President of Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold-George Mealey, confirmed the huge copper deposits at the Ertsberg. It was financed by [[Freeport-McMoRan|Freeport Sulphur]], whose directors included [[Godfrey Stillman Rockefeller|Godfrey Rockefeller]], Texaco chairman Augustus Long, George Mealey, and [[Robert A. Lovett|Robert Lovett]].\n\nIn 1963 the administration<ref name= \"UNTEA AG-059\"/> of [[Dutch New Guinea]] was transferred<ref name=\"New York Agreement\" /> to Indonesia, and the mine was the first under the new [[Suharto]] administration's 1967 foreign investment laws intended to attract foreign investment to Indonesia's then ruined economy. Built at 4,100 metres (14,000&nbsp;ft) above sea level in one of Papua's most remote areas, it involved a capital and technology input well beyond Indonesia's resources at the time. Construction cost was $175 million, $55 million above the original budget.<ref name=\"McDonald\" /> A 116&nbsp;km road and [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]], [[port]], [[airstrip]], [[power plant]] and a new town called [[Tembagapura]] (literally: ''copper town'') were built. It officially opened in 1973 (although the first ore shipment was in December 1972), and was expanded by Ertsberg East, which opened in 1981. Steep [[aerial tramway]]s are used to transport equipment and people. Ore is dropped 600 metres (2,000&nbsp;ft) from the mine, concentrated and mixed with water to form a 60:40 [[slurry]]. The slurry is then pumped through a 166&nbsp;km pipeline through mountains, jungle and swamp to the port at Amamapare, dried and shipped. Each tonne of dry concentrate contains 317 kilograms of copper, 30&nbsp;grams of gold and 30&nbsp;grams of silver.\n\nIn 1977 the rebel group [[Free Papua Movement]] attacked the mine. The group dynamited the main slurry pipe, which caused tens of millions of dollars in damage, and attacked the mine facilities. The Indonesian military reacted harshly, killing at least 800 people.<ref name=\"Ondawame\" />\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the original mine had been largely depleted. Freeport explored for other deposits in the area. In 1988, Freeport identified reserves valued at $40 billion at ''Grasberg'' (Dutch, \"Grass Mountain\"), just {{convert|3|km|abbr=off}} from the Ertsberg mine. The winding road to Grasberg, the H.E.A.T. (Heavy Equipment Access Trail), was estimated to require $12 million to $15 million to be built. An Indonesian road-builder, Ilyas Hamid, who had contributed to the Ertsberg road took a [[bulldozer]] and drove it downhill sketching the path. The road cost just $2 million when completed.\n\nThe 2003\u20132006 boom in copper prices increased the profitability of the mine. The extra consumption of copper for Asian electrical infrastructure overwhelmed copper supply and caused prices to increase from around $1500/ton to $8100/ton ($0.70/lb to $4.00/lb).\n\nIn 2005, the New York Times reported that between 1998 and 2004 Freeport had given senior military and police officers and military units nearly $20 million.<ref name=\"NYT2005\">{{cite news|last1=Perlez|first1=Jane|last2=Bonner|first2=Raymond|title=Below a Mountain of Wealth, a River of Waste|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/world/asia/below-a-mountain-of-wealth-a-river-of-waste.html|accessdate=9 October 2017|work=The New York Times|date=27 December 2005}}</ref>\n\n== Mine workings ==\n[[File:GrasbergMine ISS011-E-9620.jpg|thumb|300px|The '''Grasberg Mine''' complex from space in 2005.

The rim of the open pit is at about {{convert|4,270|m}}.]]\n\nThe workings include a very large [[open pit mine]], an [[underground mine]] and four [[Froth flotation#Mining|concentrators]]. The open pit mine \u2013 which forms a mile-wide crater at the surface \u2013 is a high-volume, low-cost operation, producing more than 67 million tonnes of ore and providing over 75% of the mill feed in 2006.\n\nOre undergoes primary crushing at the mine, before being delivered by ore passes to the mill complex for further crushing, grinding and flotation. Grasberg's milling and concentrating complex is the largest in the world, with four crushers and two giant [[Mill (grinding)#SAG mill|semi-autogenous grinding]] (SAG) units processing a daily average of 240,000 tonnes of ore in 2006.\n\nA [[Collector (chemistry)|flotation reagent]] is used to separate a copper-gold [[Copper extraction#Concentration|concentrate]] from the ore. Slurry containing the copper-gold concentrate is delivered by three pipelines to the seaport of [[Amamapare]], over 70 miles away, where it is dewatered. Once filtered and dried, the concentrate \u2013 containing copper, gold and silver \u2013 is shipped to [[smelters]] around the world.\n\nThe facilities at the port also include a coal-fired power station, which supplies the Grasberg operations.<ref name=\"mining-technology grasbergopenpit\" />\n\n== Environment ==\n[[File:Landsat 29may03 28m Freeport named.jpg|thumb|upright|Freeport's Contract of Work Area. Deep purple in the river is mine tailings (2003).]]\nThe concentrator's [[tailings]], generated at a rate of 700,000 tonnes per day,<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> are the subject of considerable environmental concern, as they wash into the [[Aikwa]] riverine system and Arafura Sea. Some {{convert|130|km2|sqmi|0}} (eventually {{convert|230|km2|sqmi|0}})<ref name=\"natural-resources\" /> of lowland areas along the [[Aikwa River]], are covered by braided sedimentary channels indicative of high sediment load (similar to glacial runoff). Native fish have nearly disappeared from now-turbid waters of the Aikwa River which are unsuitable for aquatic life.<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> The overburden (700 kt/d) <ref name=\"FCX200610K\" /> remains in the highlands, up to 480 m deep and covering {{convert|8|km2|sqmi|0}}. Its acidic runoff, dissolved copper, and the finer material gets washed into the headwaters of the [[Wanagon River]]. It settles out along the river course and then into the ocean, and will continue to do so indefinitely. Freeport's official response is that [[overburden]] is placed in the highlands as part of its Overburden Management Plan, at \"sites capped with [[limestone]] and constantly monitored. Tailings are transported to the lowlands in a designated river system. Once reaching the lowlands, they are captured in an engineered system of levees built for that purpose.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Tailings Factsheet|url=https://ptfi.co.id/media/files/fact/57c933726bfd4_7-sirsat.pdf|website=PT Freeport Indonesia|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Environmental Management Factsheet|url=https://ptfi.co.id/media/files/fact/57c93359314ff_6-manajemen-lingkungan.pdf|website=PT Freeport Indonesia|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=2015}}</ref> An Indonesian Environment Ministry's field report in 2004, found levels of sediment 37,500 milligrams per litre as the river entered the lowlands and 7,500 milligrams as the river entered the Arafura Sea, while the maximum under Indonesian law is not to exceed 400 milligrams per litre.<ref name=\"NYT2005\" />\n\nIn 1995, the [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] (OPIC) revoked Freeport's insurance policy for environmental violations of a sort that would not be allowed in the US.<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> It was the first action of this sort by OPIC, and Freeport responded with a lawsuit against them.<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> Freeport said an environmental report reached inaccurate conclusions,<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> the result of a single 1994 visit to Grasberg. The company later underwent an independent environmental audit by [[Dames & Moore]] and passed. In April 1996, Freeport canceled its policy with the OPIC, stating that their corporate activities had outgrown the policy's limits. However, the OPIC report was later publicly released.<ref>{{cite report|author1=EnviroSearch International|title=Final Report - Environmental Review of P.T.

Freeport argues that its actions meet industry standards and have been approved by the requisite authorities.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} It was reported in 2005 that since 1997 Freeport had been breaching Indonesian environmental laws.<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> Freeport estimates it will generate six billion tons of waste.<ref name=\"NYT2005\" />\n\nBoth Freeport and its partner [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] have been excluded from the investment portfolio of [[The Government Pension Fund of Norway]], the world's second-largest pension fund, due to criticism over the environmental damages caused by the Grasberg mine. Stocks at a value of ca. US$870 million were divested from the fund as a result of the decisions.<ref name=\"regjeringen 2008-09-09\" /><ref name=\"regjeringen 2006-06-06\" />\n\n== Attacks on the mine ==\nViolent ambushes near the Grasberg mine have occurred as early as August 2002, when three contract school teachers were killed. [[Kopassus]], the Indonesian Special Forces, allegedly instigated the incident.<ref name=\"Asia Times 10 December 2002\" /><ref name=\"The Age 21 July 2009\" />\n\nA series of attacks started on 11 July 2009, and continued for more than five days. A Freeport employee, 29-year-old Australian Drew Grant was shot and killed while sitting in the back of a car on the way to a game of golf. Indonesian police indicated that Grant was killed by five shots he sustained to the neck, chest and stomach by unknown assailants using military-issue weapons. The attack also killed Freeport security guard Markus Ratealo and a number of police officers.<ref name=\"The Age 21 July 2009\" /><ref name=\"ABConline 13 July 2009\" />\n\nOn 7 April 2011, two Freeport employees were killed when the company car they were traveling in caught fire. Bullets were found inside the car, giving weight to the suspicion that the car was fired on by unknown gunmen. This incident sparked a protest by hundreds of Freeport employees concerned about the security along the jungle road leading up to the mine.<ref name=\"Jakarta Globe 8 April 2011 Killings\" /><ref name=\"Jakarta Globe 8 April 2011 Burning Car\" />\n\nThe Grasberg mine has been a frequent source of friction in Papua. Possible causes of friction are the mine's environmental impact on Papua, the perceived low share of profits going to local Papuans (Freeport's annual report shows it made $4.1billion in operating profit on revenue of $6.4billion in 2010) and the questionable legality of the payments made to Indonesian security forces for their services to guard the site.<ref name=\"Jakarta Globe 8 April 2011 Killings\" />\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nOn May 14, 2013, a training facility tunnel collapsed trapping at least 33 workers underground.

While there, he made notes of a peculiar black rock with greenish coloring, and spent several weeks estimating the extent of the [[gold]] and [[copper]] deposits. In 1939, he filed a report about the ''Ertsberg'' (Dutch for \"ore mountain\"). He was working for Nederlandsche Nieuw Guinea Petroleum Maatschappij (NNGPM), an exploration company formed by [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] in 1935, with 40% [[Standard Vacuum Oil Company]] interest and 20% Far Pacific investments ([[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] subsidiary).\n\nIn March 1959, the ''[[New York Times]]'' published an article revealing the Dutch were searching for the mountain source of alluvial gold which had been flowing into the [[Arafura Sea]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Parrots|first1=Lindesay|title=Dutch to explore New Guinea area - Remote Section of Disputed Territory Will Be Object of Intensive Research|url=http://wpik.org/Src/NYT/19590306newExplor.pdf|accessdate=9 October 2017|work=New York Times|date=6 March 1959|page=8}}</ref> Geologist [[Forbes Wilson]], working for the Freeport mining company in August 1959 after reading Dozy's 1936 report, immediately prepared to explore the Ertsberg site. In 1960 the expedition, led by Forbes Wilson and President of Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold-George Mealey, confirmed the huge copper deposits at the Ertsberg. It was financed by [[Freeport-McMoRan|Freeport Sulphur]], whose directors included [[Godfrey Stillman Rockefeller|Godfrey Rockefeller]], Texaco chairman Augustus Long, George Mealey, and [[Robert A. Lovett|Robert Lovett]].\n\nIn 1963 the administration<ref name= \"UNTEA AG-059\"/> of [[Dutch New Guinea]] was transferred<ref name=\"New York Agreement\" /> to Indonesia, and the mine was the first under the new [[Suharto]] administration's 1967 foreign investment laws intended to attract foreign investment to Indonesia's then ruined economy. Built at 4,100 metres (14,000&nbsp;ft) above sea level in one of Papua's most remote areas, it involved a capital and technology input well beyond Indonesia's resources at the time. Construction cost was $175 million, $55 million above the original budget.<ref name=\"McDonald\" /> A 116&nbsp;km road and [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]], [[port]], [[airstrip]], [[power plant]] and a new town called [[Tembagapura]] (literally: ''copper town'') were built. It officially opened in 1973 (although the first ore shipment was in December 1972), and was expanded by Ertsberg East, which opened in 1981. Steep [[aerial tramway]]s are used to transport equipment and people. Ore is dropped 600 metres (2,000&nbsp;ft) from the mine, concentrated and mixed with water to form a 60:40 [[slurry]]. The slurry is then pumped through a 166&nbsp;km pipeline through mountains, jungle and swamp to the port at Amamapare, dried and shipped. Each tonne of dry concentrate contains 317 kilograms of copper, 30&nbsp;grams of gold and 30&nbsp;grams of silver.\n\nIn 1977 the rebel group [[Free Papua Movement]] attacked the mine. The group dynamited the main slurry pipe, which caused tens of millions of dollars in damage, and attacked the mine facilities. The Indonesian military reacted harshly, killing at least 800 people.<ref name=\"Ondawame\" />\n\nBy the mid-1980s, the original mine had been largely depleted. Freeport explored for other deposits in the area. In 1988, Freeport identified reserves valued at $40 billion at ''Grasberg'' (Dutch, \"Grass Mountain\"), just {{convert|3|km|abbr=off}} from the Ertsberg mine. The winding road to Grasberg, the H.E.A.T. (Heavy Equipment Access Trail), was estimated to require $12 million to $15 million to be built. An Indonesian road-builder, Ilyas Hamid, who had contributed to the Ertsberg road took a [[bulldozer]] and drove it downhill sketching the path. The road cost just $2 million when completed.\n\nThe 2003\u20132006 boom in copper prices increased the profitability of the mine. The extra consumption of copper for Asian electrical infrastructure overwhelmed copper supply and caused prices to increase from around $1500/ton to $8100/ton ($0.70/lb to $4.00/lb).\n\nIn 2005, the New York Times reported that between 1998 and 2004 Freeport had given senior military and police officers and military units nearly $20 million.<ref name=\"NYT2005\">{{cite news|last1=Perlez|first1=Jane|last2=Bonner|first2=Raymond|title=Below a Mountain of Wealth, a River of Waste|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/world/asia/below-a-mountain-of-wealth-a-river-of-waste.html|accessdate=9 October 2017|work=The New York Times|date=27 December 2005}}</ref>\n\n== Mine workings ==\n[[File:GrasbergMine ISS011-E-9620.jpg|thumb|300px|The '''Grasberg Mine''' complex from space in 2005.

The rim of the open pit is at about {{convert|4,270|m}}.]]\n\nThe workings include a very large [[open pit mine]], an [[underground mine]] and four [[Froth flotation#Mining|concentrators]]. The open pit mine \u2013 which forms a mile-wide crater at the surface \u2013 is a high-volume, low-cost operation, producing more than 67 million tonnes of ore and providing over 75% of the mill feed in 2006.\n\nOre undergoes primary crushing at the mine, before being delivered by ore passes to the mill complex for further crushing, grinding and flotation. Grasberg's milling and concentrating complex is the largest in the world, with four crushers and two giant [[Mill (grinding)#SAG mill|semi-autogenous grinding]] (SAG) units processing a daily average of 240,000 tonnes of ore in 2006.\n\nA [[Collector (chemistry)|flotation reagent]] is used to separate a copper-gold [[Copper extraction#Concentration|concentrate]] from the ore. Slurry containing the copper-gold concentrate is delivered by three pipelines to the seaport of [[Amamapare]], over 70 miles away, where it is dewatered. Once filtered and dried, the concentrate \u2013 containing copper, gold and silver \u2013 is shipped to [[smelters]] around the world.\n\nThe facilities at the port also include a coal-fired power station, which supplies the Grasberg operations.<ref name=\"mining-technology grasbergopenpit\" />\n\n== Environment ==\n[[File:Landsat 29may03 28m Freeport named.jpg|thumb|upright|Freeport's Contract of Work Area. Deep purple in the river is mine tailings (2003).]]\nThe concentrator's [[tailings]], generated at a rate of 700,000 tonnes per day,<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> are the subject of considerable environmental concern, as they wash into the [[Aikwa]] riverine system and Arafura Sea. Some {{convert|130|km2|sqmi|0}} (eventually {{convert|230|km2|sqmi|0}})<ref name=\"natural-resources\" /> of lowland areas along the [[Aikwa River]], are covered by braided sedimentary channels indicative of high sediment load (similar to glacial runoff). Native fish have nearly disappeared from now-turbid waters of the Aikwa River which are unsuitable for aquatic life.<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> The overburden (700 kt/d) <ref name=\"FCX200610K\" /> remains in the highlands, up to 480 m deep and covering {{convert|8|km2|sqmi|0}}. Its acidic runoff, dissolved copper, and the finer material gets washed into the headwaters of the [[Wanagon River]]. It settles out along the river course and then into the ocean, and will continue to do so indefinitely. Freeport's official response is that [[overburden]] is placed in the highlands as part of its Overburden Management Plan, at \"sites capped with [[limestone]] and constantly monitored. Tailings are transported to the lowlands in a designated river system. Once reaching the lowlands, they are captured in an engineered system of levees built for that purpose.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Tailings Factsheet|url=https://ptfi.co.id/media/files/fact/57c933726bfd4_7-sirsat.pdf|website=PT Freeport Indonesia|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Environmental Management Factsheet|url=https://ptfi.co.id/media/files/fact/57c93359314ff_6-manajemen-lingkungan.pdf|website=PT Freeport Indonesia|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=2015}}</ref> An Indonesian Environment Ministry's field report in 2004, found levels of sediment 37,500 milligrams per litre as the river entered the lowlands and 7,500 milligrams as the river entered the Arafura Sea, while the maximum under Indonesian law is not to exceed 400 milligrams per litre.<ref name=\"NYT2005\" />\n\nIn 1995, the [[Overseas Private Investment Corporation]] (OPIC) revoked Freeport's insurance policy for environmental violations of a sort that would not be allowed in the US.<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> It was the first action of this sort by OPIC, and Freeport responded with a lawsuit against them.<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> Freeport said an environmental report reached inaccurate conclusions,<ref name=\"NYT2005\" /> the result of a single 1994 visit to Grasberg. The company later underwent an independent environmental audit by [[Dames & Moore]] and passed. In April 1996, Freeport canceled its policy with the OPIC, stating that their corporate activities had outgrown the policy's limits. However, the OPIC report was later publicly released.<ref>{{cite report|author1=EnviroSearch International|title=Final Report - Environmental Review of P.T.

A Freeport employee, 29-year-old Australian Drew Grant was shot and killed while sitting in the back of a car on the way to a game of golf. Indonesian police indicated that Grant was killed by five shots he sustained to the neck, chest and stomach by unknown assailants using military-issue weapons. The attack also killed Freeport security guard Markus Ratealo and a number of police officers.<ref name=\"The Age 21 July 2009\" /><ref name=\"ABConline 13 July 2009\" />\n\nOn 7 April 2011, two Freeport employees were killed when the company car they were traveling in caught fire. Bullets were found inside the car, giving weight to the suspicion that the car was fired on by unknown gunmen. This incident sparked a protest by hundreds of Freeport employees concerned about the security along the jungle road leading up to the mine.<ref name=\"Jakarta Globe 8 April 2011 Killings\" /><ref name=\"Jakarta Globe 8 April 2011 Burning Car\" />\n\nThe Grasberg mine has been a frequent source of friction in Papua. Possible causes of friction are the mine's environmental impact on Papua, the perceived low share of profits going to local Papuans (Freeport's annual report shows it made $4.1billion in operating profit on revenue of $6.4billion in 2010) and the questionable legality of the payments made to Indonesian security forces for their services to guard the site.<ref name=\"Jakarta Globe 8 April 2011 Killings\" />\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nOn May 14, 2013, a training facility tunnel collapsed trapping at least 33 workers underground.

There is one long-stay car park serving Terminals 1 and 3 and a separate dedicated long-stay car park for Terminal 2. In 2009 the airport opened ''JetParks'' \u2013 two long-stay car parks less than a mile from the terminals. This is a cheaper alternative to the on-site car parks and is served by a 24-hour shuttle bus every 15 minutes. The airport also operates a ''Shuttle Park'' for long-stay car parking, which is also served by a regular courtesy bus and is located just off the airport site to the east of Terminal 3.\nThe airport has since augmented these products with a 3rd ''JetParks'' car park, ''JetParks 3''. This is located adjacent to Shuttle Parks and as a result, Shuttle Parks was renamed ''JetParks Plus''.\nManchester Airport also operates a very large scale [[valet parking]] product across all 3 terminals that it has branded as \"Meet & Greet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/|title=Official website for Manchester Airport, live flight information, car parking & booking flights - Manchester Airport|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 a new, 9000 space car park located underneath the approach to 23R was constructed, the first area of the site opened in the autumn.

Each level of the car park is colour-coded. The floor, walls, ceiling and supports have all received a repaint with every parking space having a sensor and green light above it, with empty parking bays indicated by the green light.\n\nOfficial long-stay on-airport [[parking]] from Manchester Airport is located near the terminals and served by a regular courtesy bus. There is one long-stay car park serving Terminals 1 and 3 and a separate dedicated long-stay car park for Terminal 2. In 2009 the airport opened ''JetParks'' \u2013 two long-stay car parks less than a mile from the terminals. This is a cheaper alternative to the on-site car parks and is served by a 24-hour shuttle bus every 15 minutes. The airport also operates a ''Shuttle Park'' for long-stay car parking, which is also served by a regular courtesy bus and is located just off the airport site to the east of Terminal 3.\nThe airport has since augmented these products with a 3rd ''JetParks'' car park, ''JetParks 3''. This is located adjacent to Shuttle Parks and as a result, Shuttle Parks was renamed ''JetParks Plus''.\nManchester Airport also operates a very large scale [[valet parking]] product across all 3 terminals that it has branded as \"Meet & Greet\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/|title=Official website for Manchester Airport, live flight information, car parking & booking flights - Manchester Airport|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 a new, 9000 space car park located underneath the approach to 23R was constructed, the first area of the site opened in the autumn. The remainder of the facility will open in time for summer 2015.\n\nThere are several privately operated car parks within a short distance of the airport, served by shuttle bus, as well as several off-site companies operating valet parking services.\n\n===Drop off zones===\nUp until 2018 cars dropping off passengers could do so outside terminals for free.  On 10 July 2018 Manchester Airport took the step of introducing a fee of \u00a33 to \u00a34 for vehicles dropping off passengers at terminals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/parking/pick-up-and-drop-off/|title=Pick Up & Drop Off Information & Charges - Manchester Airport|website=Manchester Airport|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref> Alternatively, passengers being dropped off can be taken to an off-site car park from where a shuttle bus operates to the terminals. The airport issues fines of up to \u00a3100 to vehicles which breach its terms and conditions for the drop off zones.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchesterairport.co.uk/terms-and-conditions/free-drop-off-terms-and-conditions/|title=Free Drop-Off Terms and Conditions - Manchester Airport|website=Manchester Airport|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref> The changes have been seen as unwelcome and nonconstructive by passengers and taxi drivers, with some saying they will boycott the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/manchester-airport-drop-off-fees-14903008|title=Drivers claim Manchester Airport drop-off charging is causing MORE gridlock|first=Charlotte|last=Cox|date=13 July 2018|website=manchestereveningnews.co.uk|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref> The change has also attracted criticism from local Councillors in Cheshire, who point out that many places directly under Manchester Airport's flight paths don't have a direct [[public transport]] link to the airport. While some other UK airports also have drop off charges Manchester Airport's charges are overall higher than those at any other airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/travel/2018/07/how-to-get-around-airport-kiss-and-fly-charges--and-drop-off-loved-ones-for-free|title=Airports now charge up to \u00a34.50 for a 10-min drop-off - how to avoid 'kiss and fly' fees|website=Moneysavingexpert.com|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Effect on the area==\n{{unbalanced section|date=September 2016}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\nBetween 1997 and 1999 three [[protest camp]]s were set up to oppose the building of the second runway, the felling of nearby trees on land owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in Styal, Cheshire and air transportation in general. Camps were set up in Flywood, Arthur's Wood<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.aol.com/pp3office/arthpr.htm|title=Save Arthurs wood Press statements|accessdate=31 December 2006}}</ref> and Cedar's Wood.

However, the former [[Macclesfield (borough)|Macclesfield Borough Council]] refused to give them planning permission to do so and expressed annoyance at the airport for not investing enough in public transport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewilmslowexpress.co.uk/news/s/230/530055_victory_for_green_belt_campaigners_as_airports_plan_for_styal_is_rejected.html|title=Victory for green belt campaigners as airport's plan for Styal is rejected|publisher=Wilmslow Express|accessdate=9 November 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n* On 27 March 1951, a [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47A-75-DL Dakota 3]] cargo aircraft operated by [[Air Transport Charter]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aerotransport.org/php/go.php?query=operator&luck=1&where=26713 |title=AeroTransport Data Bank |website=Aerotransport.org |date=19 December 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref> and en route to [[RAF Nutts Corner|Nutts Corner]], [[County Antrim|Antrim]], Northern Ireland, [[1951 Ringway Dakota crash|crashed]] at Heyhead shortly after take-off from runway 06, following the aircraft's failure to gain height. There were four fatalities \u2013 two of the three crew on board and two of the three passengers. The subsequent investigation found that the crash resulted from a loss of engine power, caused by ice forming in the [[Carburetor|carburettor]] intakes, attributable to the captain's failure to use the heat controls. An extended undercarriage and snow on the wings may have also been contributory factors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19510327-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Douglas C-47A-75-DL Dakota 3 G-AJVZ Manchester-Ringway Airport (MAN) |website=Aviation-safety.net |accessdate=4 April 2010}}</ref>\n* On 14 March 1957, [[British European Airways]] Flight \"Bealine 411\" operated by [[Vickers Viscount]] 701 (registration G-ALWE) inbound from Amsterdam crashed into houses in Shadow Moss Road, Woodhouse Park.

In May 1992, an official \"Aviation Viewing Park\" (AVP) was created just off the [[A538 road]] on the south-western side of the airfield.

The street ran from the corner of Reform Street to North Lindsay Street, passing along the north side of [[Dundee Parish Church (St Mary's)|St Mary's Parish Church]].  The Overgate was also once intersected by Tally Street which acted as important connection from Couttie's Wynd to Burial Wynd (now Barrack Street).  The 'gate' in Overgate comes from the Old Norse word 'gata' meaning road or street and has the same origins as the word [[gait]] meaning to walk. The street was referred to as 'Overgate' because it was the higher of the two roads running alongside the city churches, the other being called the Nethergate (i.e. lower road). Gate and gait can often be found in historic and modern street names mostly meaning the same thing and Dundee's city centre retains several streets of a similar name: Nethergate, Cowgate, Seagate, Murraygate, Wellgate and Marketgait. The Overgate's old and dilapidated properties were deemed 'slums' in the early 20th century.  James Thomson proposed their clearance in his city plan of 1910. A similar proposal came in the form of the Adams Plan of 1937; this did not progress due to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]].\n\n===1960s Overgate Centre===\nThe 1960s Overgate Centre was a mixed-use development comprising hotel and offices to the west (fronting West Marketgait), a pedestrian precinct (incorporating an upper tier of shops) facing the City Churches;and anchor stores / covered mall to the east (to Reform Street).  It was designed by Ian Burke, Hugh Martin & Partners in 1963 and hailed as the first comprehensive town-centre development of its type in Scotland.  It included public sculpture panels in concrete and painted steel (depicting women in traditional market scenes) by Ian Eadie.  It also had a roof-top car park accessed from Lindsay Street.  Abandoned by the more fashionable chainstores when the [[Wellgate Centre]] (an enclosed mall) opened in 1978, it became much neglected and run-down within a decade. Attempts at refurbishment by replacing concrete panels with decorative steel were rejected in favour of comprehensive redevelopment.\n\n===1998 to 2000 demolition and rebuild===\nThe 1998 rebuild effectively shifted the centre of gravity back to the Overgate, when many of the top line retailers chose the newer development, triggering a decline in the Wellgate Centre's fortunes, which has since seen several attempts at rejuvenation.\n\nOf the 1960s Overgate structure, only the parts surrounding the Reform Street entrance survive. However, with the exception of the City House office block (which retains its original facade), this older section was refurbished and reclad to seamlessly match the newly built main body.\n\n====Postponed \u00a350m expansion====\nIn 2006, permission was granted to expand and, in 2008, [[Dundee City Council]] moved tenants out of flats next to the centre to facilitate the project. Demolition commended in May/June 2009.  The \u00a350,000,000 expansion is intended to double the size of the centre and to include 50 new shops and a [[food court]]. The plans were put 'on hold' in September 2009 due to the recession.

{"title_page": "Copper Basin (Tennessee)", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Copper Basin (disambiguation){{!}}Copper Basin}}\n{{short description|Geological area in southeastern Tennessee, United States}}\nThe '''Copper Basin''', also known as the '''Ducktown Basin''', is a [[geology|geological]] region located primarily in [[Polk County, Tennessee]] that contains deposits of [[copper]] ore and covers approximately 60,000 acres. Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.<ref name=ross95>Ross 1935, p. 95-96</ref><ref>Emmons, Laney 1926, p. 13</ref>\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]]. Other communities include Postelle in the northwest section of the basin, Isabella in the eastern portion, and Harbuck, [[Turtletown, Tennessee|Turtletown]], and [[Farner, Tennessee|Farner]] just north of the basin.<ref>{{cite map |author = Tennessee Department of Transportation Long Range Planning Division Office of Data Visualization|title = Polk County|year = 2018|url =https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/tdot/maps/county-maps-(us-shields)/o-w/Polk%20County.pdf|publisher = [[Tennessee Department of Transportation]]}}</ref> The Copper Basin is also included in the [[Cleveland metropolitan area, Tennessee|Cleveland, Tennessee metropolitan area]].<ref>{{cite press release|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=OMB Designates 49 New Metropolitan Statistical Areas|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/assets/OMB/pubpress/2003-18.pdf|location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[Executive branch of the United States government]]|agency=[[Office of Management and Budget]]|date=June 6, 2003|access-date=2019-10-06}}</ref>\n\nMost of the rocks in the Copper Basin are [[metamorphic rock]]s deposited during the [[Cambrian|Lower Cambrian period]], but also include some [[igneous rock]]s.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. This also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to a [[desert]] and the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite image showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia.

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by Cities Services Corporation on June 14, 1963. A strike in 1969 resulted in an eight percent pay increase for employees and an increase in paid benefits. During the [[Vietnam War]], sulfuric acid produced in the Copper Basin was supplied to the [[Volunteer Army Ammunition Plant]] in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]].<ref name=\"Brooks 1990, p. 33\">Brooks 1990, p. 33</ref> At the beginning of the 1970s, the company announced plans to expand, but faced financial problems into the decade. Two strikes, in 1974 and 1977, the latter of which lasted four months, also led to the decline in mining activities in the basin, as well as anger and division amongst locals, especially those who did not support the strikes.<ref>Brooks 1990, p. 34</ref> The Tennessee Copper Company was purchased by a group of investors in September 1982 and the name was changed to the Tennessee Chemical Company.

In 1876, the companies began importing logs from Fannin County, Georgia. The smelting process released [[sulfur]] gas, which reacted with [[water vapor]] in the atmosphere, forming [[sulfuric acid]] and precipitating as [[acid rain]]. This subsequently killed the majority of the vegetation in the basin, and [[Stormwater runoff|ran off]] into the Ocoee River and surrounding tributaries, killing most aquatic life. This also resulted in erosion of the topsoil, much of which ended up in the Ocoee River.<ref name=gms/> The reddish-brown landscape that resulted, which consisted mostly of iron and copper ore, was often compared to a [[desert]] and the surface of [[Mars]], and was distinctly visible from space.<ref>{{cite news|last=Benton|first=Ben|date=2020-01-01|title=Copper Basin restoration work earns engineering award|url=https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/local/story/2020/jan/01/copper-basin-work-engineering-award/511930/|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|location=Chattanooga, Tennessee|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref> A total of 32,000 acres were affected.<ref name=tva>{{cite web|url=https://www.tva.gov/Environment/Environmental-Stewardship/Land-Management/The-Greening-of-Copper-Basin|title=The Greening of Copper Basin|author=<!--Not stated-->|website=tva.gov|publisher=Tennessee Valley Authority|access-date=2020-02-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Copper-basin-satellite-1984.png|thumb|right|Satellite image showing the Copper Basin in 1984]]\nThe state of Georgia began suing the Tennessee Copper Company in the mid 1880s, claiming that the mining operations were causing damage to forests and crops in northern Georgia. In 1904, smokestacks were constructed to disperse the pollution; this, however, only worsened the problem.<ref name=gms/> That same year, in ''Madison v. Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v.
