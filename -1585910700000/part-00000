It is programmed by its in-house production studio, [[Williams Street]]. It currently broadcasts nightly from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]. The block is marketed as a separate network from Cartoon Network for ratings purposes, similar to [[Nickelodeon]] On Thursday-Saturday. the nighttime branding of [[Nick at Nite|Nick At Nite]].\n\nDebuting in 2001, Adult Swim serves as the nighttime identity of Cartoon Network, and was established as alternative programming during the late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience, children between the ages of 7 and 15, would normally be sleeping. In 2005, the block was granted its own [[Nielsen ratings]] report from Cartoon Network due to targeting a separate demographic. The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action shows; including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series, [[anime]], [[original video animation]], and [[short film]]s with generally minimal or no editing for content.\n\nThe block has frequently aired [[adult animation]] features, [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]], [[sketch comedy]], and [[Television pilot|pilots]]. The block's shows are known for their sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. Many of its programs are aesthetically [[experimental]], transgressive, improvised, and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] in nature. This has become a source of conflict, with some saying that Adult Swim is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in [[absurdity|absurd]] and [[shock value|shock]] comedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|title=Thinking small|website=Channelweb.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105222547/http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs with Cartoon Network, Adult Swim's reach through various services totals 94 million American households.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable network coverage area household universe estimates: January 2016 \u2013 Broadcasting & Cable|website=Broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=November 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202182549/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|archive-date=December 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Creation and development ===\n{{See also|Space Ghost Coast to Coast}}\n[[Cartoon Network]]'s original head programmer, [[Mike Lazzo]], conceived<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs \u2013 Fred Seibert's Blog \u2013 Dinner at [adult swim].|website=Archives.frederatorblogs.com|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630142003/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Adult Swim. The block grew out of Cartoon Network's previous attempts at airing content appropriate for teenagers and young adults who might be watching the channel after 11 pm (ET/PT). The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows that presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts, such as ''[[ToonHeads]]'', ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]'', ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[Late Night Black and White]]'', and ''[[O Canada (TV series)|O Canada]]''. Another block, [[Toonami]]'s \"Midnight Run\", aired the network's action programming uncut with minimal edits.

That was followed by the ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' episode [[List of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! episodes|\"Tommy\"]], which featured the star and director of the film [[Tommy Wiseau]].\n* In 2010, Adult Swim re-aired ''The Room'' for a second year in a row, with bumps featuring [[Tommy Wiseau]] being interviewed on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''. Sex scenes remained censored, but the [[TV Parental Guidelines|parental rating]] was raised to TV-MA.\n* In 2011, ''The Room'' was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled ''Earth Ghost'', a CGI version of the ''Lowe Country'' pilot shown on [[Adult Swim Video]] in 2007.\n* In 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with [[Toonami]], a former programming block from [[Cartoon Network]]. After first playing the opening sequence of ''The Room'', the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools' Day before introducing that week's scheduled episode of ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]''. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!

T.O.M. also presented a review of ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured.

The episode \"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]\" aired repeatedly from 8pm until midnight on TV (shortening [[Toonami]] in the process and pre-empting premieres of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''), and was also streaming on a loop on the adultswim.com streams all night. The bumps included new commissioned idents related to ''Rick and Morty'' and announcement promos of upcoming shows and seasons.\n* On March 31, 2018, Toonami premiered the first episode of ''[[FLCL|FLCL Alternative]]'', the show's third season (even as the second season had not been aired yet), albeit in Japanese with English subtitles, breaking Toonami's policy of only playing dubbed anime. Following ''FLCL'', the 2004 film ''[[Mind Game (film)|Mind Game]]'', directed by [[Masaaki Yuasa]], was played. Most of Toonami's scheduled programming for that night (featuring ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders]], [[Hunter \u00d7 Hunter]], [[Naruto: Shippuden (season 10)|Naruto: Shippuden]], [[Space Dandy]], [[Cowboy Bebop]] & [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG]]'') were pushed back to 2:45&nbsp;a.m. after the film, and aired subbed instead of dubbed. The short ''Scavengers'' finished off the block at 5:45&nbsp;a.m. The block aired special bumpers with T.O.M. and S.A.R.A. and a game review of ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', all dubbed to Japanese with English subtitles and pink colors instead of the usual green. The Adult Swim logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as [\u30a2\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30e0]), affecting both bumps and the channel bug. Block runner Jason DeMarco confirmed on Twitter that all original scheduled programming that was affected by the English subtitled joke after ''Mind Game'' would air the same episode dubbed the following week.\n* On April 1, 2018, in yet another rare double prank, Adult Swim aired normally until 11:00&nbsp;p.m., when it started airing an animated parody of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' titled \"Bushworld Adventures\", created by Michael R. Cusack.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adult Swim|title=Bushworld Adventures {{!}} Adult Swim|date=2018-04-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|accessdate=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406054404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It follows Rick and Morty in [[Australia]] going on wild adventures in search to find the green cube that was left at Bendigo. It looped three more times until midnight, pre-empting ''Rick and Morty'' and two ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]'' reruns in the process. All of Adult Swim's nature-themed bumpers that aired throughout the hour were Australian-themed. This special short was also simulcasted on a loop in a marathon stream on adultswim.com all night.\n* In 2019, regular programming was replaced, beginning at midnight, with the debut of ''[[G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu]]'', an anime parody that aired until 5:45am, when an episode of ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'' played as a buffer between it and Cartoon Network's sign-on at 6am. It was simulcast both on TV and on Adult Swim's online live stream. It additionally served as the premiere series for the new 24/7 [[Adult Swim (Canada)|Adult Swim]] network in [[Canada]].\n* In 2020, regular programming was replaced again. The intro for a second season of ''G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu'' was played, but it would be interrupted by [[Post Malone]], who would host several bumpers (along with [[Swae Lee]] later on in the block) introducing stealth premieres of new seasons of ''[[Primal (TV series)|Primal]]'', ''[[Dream Corp, LLC]]'', ''[[Tigtone]]'', ''[[The Shivering Truth]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Lazor Wulf]]'', ''[[12 oz. Mouse]]'' and ''[[Tender Touches]]''. The stealth premiere block also showcased pilots of new shows ''YOLO: Crystal Fantasy'', ''JJ Villard's Fairy Tales'' and ''Smiling Friends''. Malone would also make silent cameos on said shows via green screen.<ref>https://comicbook.com/anime/2020/04/01/adult-swim-april-fools-day-primal-new-episodes-reaction/</ref>\n\n=== Alternate reality games ===\n[[File:Adult Swim ARG first transmission from Delilah Aug 2017.png|thumb|right|alt=A black screen with the text \"Hello my name is D.E.L.I.L.A.H.\"|Image from part of the ARG transmission that aired on August 27, 2017.

This new account informed everyone that they were searching for their missing sister named Amelia. The bump transmissions then started referring viewers to this new Twitter account as well as several new [[Instagram]] accounts, continuing to provide puzzles that required solving. Some players have used [[Discord (software)|Discord]] to work together as a team in a dedicated server to solve the puzzles and share theories about the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discord.gg/HtGAT5T|title=Discord \u2013 Free voice and text chat for gamers|website=Discord|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> The ARG has been consistently broadcasting new messages and puzzles every Sunday since the initial August 2017 broadcast, with only a short hiatus during the 2017 holiday break. On March 25, 2018 it was revealed that Amelia was safe and had been for quite some time. Players learned that Amelia's messages asking for help were actually sent 3 years prior and that their delay in being received was caused by [[time dilation]]. This revelation effectively completed the second chapter of the ARG, it also alluded to the next phase which has just started as of June 2018.\n\n== Programming ==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim|List of programs broadcast by Toonami}}\nOriginal shows currently in-production and seen on Adult Swim include ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', ''[[Black Jesus (TV series)|Black Jesus]]'', ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', and ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]''. Adult Swim is best known for its inaugural slate of programming, which were parodies and remakes based on [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons (including ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' and ''[[Sealab 2021]]'').\n\nAdult Swim also airs [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs acquired from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] (such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''), original series produced for sister network [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] (''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Final Space]]''), and acquired and co-produced [[anime]] series. Adult Swim is currently one of the only networks in the United States that airs anime (besides [[Disney XD]]) and the only network that airs such programming aimed at young adults and teens rather than children.\n\nCurrently, anime and most [[Action film|action]]-genre programming air every Saturday night as part of [[Toonami]], a former Cartoon Network programming block that was relaunched as part of Adult Swim on May 26, 2012 as a \"block-within-a-block\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Cartoon Network shows that have gained a following among older viewers have also aired on Toonami; in particular, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' proved popular enough in reruns to warrant a [[Samurai Jack (season 5)|revival]] in 2017.

In June 2010, they began delaying episode availability on Adult Swim Video by one week after original television broadcast. Previously, episodes had appeared 1\u20133 days after broadcast.

Currently apps are available in the [[United States|U.S. only]] for the [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (including [[Android TV]]), [[Apple TV]], [[iOS]], [[Chromecast]], [[Roku]] and [[Xbox One]]. Due to licensing agreements certain parts of the apps including access to the live stream and past shows require the viewer to use their subscription-television provider or OTT-platform username and password to authenticate their right to access such content. A downside to these apps is the fact that, unlike free-to-air television, they are not currently compliant with U.S. [[Closed captioning]] requirements.\n\n== International ==\n[[File:Mapa Adult Swim.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=World map with the United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Russia, Tasmania, and New Zealand highlighted.|Adult Swim's international channel availability.]]\nAdult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005.

It is programmed by its in-house production studio, [[Williams Street]]. It currently broadcasts nightly from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]. The block is marketed as a separate network from Cartoon Network for ratings purposes, similar to [[Nickelodeon]] On Thursday-Saturday. the nighttime branding of [[Nick at Nite|Nick At Nite]].\n\nDebuting in 2001, Adult Swim serves as the nighttime identity of Cartoon Network, and was established as alternative programming during the late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience, children between the ages of 7 and 15, would normally be sleeping. In 2005, the block was granted its own [[Nielsen ratings]] report from Cartoon Network due to targeting a separate demographic. The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action shows; including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series, [[anime]], [[original video animation]], and [[short film]]s with generally minimal or no editing for content.\n\nThe block has frequently aired [[adult animation]] features, [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]], [[sketch comedy]], and [[Television pilot|pilots]]. The block's shows are known for their sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. Many of its programs are aesthetically [[experimental]], transgressive, improvised, and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] in nature. This has become a source of conflict, with some saying that Adult Swim is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in [[absurdity|absurd]] and [[shock value|shock]] comedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|title=Thinking small|website=Channelweb.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105222547/http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs with Cartoon Network, Adult Swim's reach through various services totals 94 million American households.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable network coverage area household universe estimates: January 2016 \u2013 Broadcasting & Cable|website=Broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=November 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202182549/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|archive-date=December 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Creation and development ===\n{{See also|Space Ghost Coast to Coast}}\n[[Cartoon Network]]'s original head programmer, [[Mike Lazzo]], conceived<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs \u2013 Fred Seibert's Blog \u2013 Dinner at [adult swim].|website=Archives.frederatorblogs.com|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630142003/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Adult Swim. The block grew out of Cartoon Network's previous attempts at airing content appropriate for teenagers and young adults who might be watching the channel after 11 pm (ET/PT). The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows that presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts, such as ''[[ToonHeads]]'', ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]'', ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[Late Night Black and White]]'', and ''[[O Canada (TV series)|O Canada]]''. Another block, [[Toonami]]'s \"Midnight Run\", aired the network's action programming uncut with minimal edits.

That was followed by the ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' episode [[List of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! episodes|\"Tommy\"]], which featured the star and director of the film [[Tommy Wiseau]].\n* In 2010, Adult Swim re-aired ''The Room'' for a second year in a row, with bumps featuring [[Tommy Wiseau]] being interviewed on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''. Sex scenes remained censored, but the [[TV Parental Guidelines|parental rating]] was raised to TV-MA.\n* In 2011, ''The Room'' was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled ''Earth Ghost'', a CGI version of the ''Lowe Country'' pilot shown on [[Adult Swim Video]] in 2007.\n* In 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with [[Toonami]], a former programming block from [[Cartoon Network]]. After first playing the opening sequence of ''The Room'', the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools' Day before introducing that week's scheduled episode of ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]''. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!

T.O.M. also presented a review of ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured.

The episode \"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]\" aired repeatedly from 8pm until midnight on TV (shortening [[Toonami]] in the process and pre-empting premieres of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''), and was also streaming on a loop on the adultswim.com streams all night. The bumps included new commissioned idents related to ''Rick and Morty'' and announcement promos of upcoming shows and seasons.\n* On March 31, 2018, Toonami premiered the first episode of ''[[FLCL|FLCL Alternative]]'', the show's third season (even as the second season had not been aired yet), albeit in Japanese with English subtitles, breaking Toonami's policy of only playing dubbed anime. Following ''FLCL'', the 2004 film ''[[Mind Game (film)|Mind Game]]'', directed by [[Masaaki Yuasa]], was played. Most of Toonami's scheduled programming for that night (featuring ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders]], [[Hunter \u00d7 Hunter]], [[Naruto: Shippuden (season 10)|Naruto: Shippuden]], [[Space Dandy]], [[Cowboy Bebop]] & [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG]]'') were pushed back to 2:45&nbsp;a.m. after the film, and aired subbed instead of dubbed. The short ''Scavengers'' finished off the block at 5:45&nbsp;a.m. The block aired special bumpers with T.O.M. and S.A.R.A. and a game review of ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', all dubbed to Japanese with English subtitles and pink colors instead of the usual green. The Adult Swim logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as [\u30a2\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30e0]), affecting both bumps and the channel bug. Block runner Jason DeMarco confirmed on Twitter that all original scheduled programming that was affected by the English subtitled joke after ''Mind Game'' would air the same episode dubbed the following week.\n* On April 1, 2018, in yet another rare double prank, Adult Swim aired normally until 11:00&nbsp;p.m., when it started airing an animated parody of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' titled \"Bushworld Adventures\", created by Michael R. Cusack.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adult Swim|title=Bushworld Adventures {{!}} Adult Swim|date=2018-04-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|accessdate=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406054404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It follows Rick and Morty in [[Australia]] going on wild adventures in search to find the green cube that was left at Bendigo. It looped three more times until midnight, pre-empting ''Rick and Morty'' and two ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]'' reruns in the process. All of Adult Swim's nature-themed bumpers that aired throughout the hour were Australian-themed. This special short was also simulcasted on a loop in a marathon stream on adultswim.com all night.\n* In 2019, regular programming was replaced, beginning at midnight, with the debut of ''[[G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu]]'', an anime parody that aired until 5:45am, when an episode of ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'' played as a buffer between it and Cartoon Network's sign-on at 6am. It was simulcast both on TV and on Adult Swim's online live stream. It additionally served as the premiere series for the new 24/7 [[Adult Swim (Canada)|Adult Swim]] network in [[Canada]].\n* In 2020, regular programming was replaced again. The intro for a second season of ''G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu'' was played, but it would be interrupted by [[Post Malone]], who would host several bumpers (along with [[Swae Lee]] later on in the block) introducing stealth premieres of new seasons of ''[[Primal (TV series)|Primal]]'', ''[[Dream Corp, LLC]]'', ''[[Tigtone]]'', ''[[The Shivering Truth]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Lazor Wulf]]'', ''[[12 Oz. Mouse]]'' and ''[[Tender Touches]]''. The stealth premiere block also showcased pilots of new shows ''YOLO: Crystal Fantasy'', ''JJ Villard's Fairy Tales'' and ''Smiling Friends''. Malone would also make silent cameos on said shows via green screen.<ref>https://comicbook.com/anime/2020/04/01/adult-swim-april-fools-day-primal-new-episodes-reaction/</ref>\n\n=== Alternate reality games ===\n[[File:Adult Swim ARG first transmission from Delilah Aug 2017.png|thumb|right|alt=A black screen with the text \"Hello my name is D.E.L.I.L.A.H.\"|Image from part of the ARG transmission that aired on August 27, 2017.

This new account informed everyone that they were searching for their missing sister named Amelia. The bump transmissions then started referring viewers to this new Twitter account as well as several new [[Instagram]] accounts, continuing to provide puzzles that required solving. Some players have used [[Discord (software)|Discord]] to work together as a team in a dedicated server to solve the puzzles and share theories about the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discord.gg/HtGAT5T|title=Discord \u2013 Free voice and text chat for gamers|website=Discord|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> The ARG has been consistently broadcasting new messages and puzzles every Sunday since the initial August 2017 broadcast, with only a short hiatus during the 2017 holiday break. On March 25, 2018 it was revealed that Amelia was safe and had been for quite some time. Players learned that Amelia's messages asking for help were actually sent 3 years prior and that their delay in being received was caused by [[time dilation]]. This revelation effectively completed the second chapter of the ARG, it also alluded to the next phase which has just started as of June 2018.\n\n== Programming ==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim|List of programs broadcast by Toonami}}\nOriginal shows currently in-production and seen on Adult Swim include ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', ''[[Black Jesus (TV series)|Black Jesus]]'', ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', and ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]''. Adult Swim is best known for its inaugural slate of programming, which were parodies and remakes based on [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons (including ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' and ''[[Sealab 2021]]'').\n\nAdult Swim also airs [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs acquired from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] (such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''), original series produced for sister network [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] (''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Final Space]]''), and acquired and co-produced [[anime]] series. Adult Swim is currently one of the only networks in the United States that airs anime (besides [[Disney XD]]) and the only network that airs such programming aimed at young adults and teens rather than children.\n\nCurrently, anime and most [[Action film|action]]-genre programming air every Saturday night as part of [[Toonami]], a former Cartoon Network programming block that was relaunched as part of Adult Swim on May 26, 2012 as a \"block-within-a-block\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Cartoon Network shows that have gained a following among older viewers have also aired on Toonami; in particular, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' proved popular enough in reruns to warrant a [[Samurai Jack (season 5)|revival]] in 2017.

In June 2010, they began delaying episode availability on Adult Swim Video by one week after original television broadcast. Previously, episodes had appeared 1\u20133 days after broadcast.

Currently apps are available in the [[United States|U.S. only]] for the [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (including [[Android TV]]), [[Apple TV]], [[iOS]], [[Chromecast]], [[Roku]] and [[Xbox One]]. Due to licensing agreements certain parts of the apps including access to the live stream and past shows require the viewer to use their subscription-television provider or OTT-platform username and password to authenticate their right to access such content. A downside to these apps is the fact that, unlike free-to-air television, they are not currently compliant with U.S. [[Closed captioning]] requirements.\n\n== International ==\n[[File:Mapa Adult Swim.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=World map with the United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Russia, Tasmania, and New Zealand highlighted.|Adult Swim's international channel availability.]]\nAdult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005.

{"title_page": "Keyboard technology", "text_new": "{{short description|Technology of keyboards}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{lead too short|date=January 2015}}\n{{original research|date=January 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Keyboard Construction.JPG|right|thumb| Keyboard construction, in four layers, of a typical notebook computer keyboard]]\n[[Computer keyboard]]s can be classified by the [[switch]] technology that they use. Computer alphanumeric keyboards typically have 80 to 110 durable switches, generally one for each key. The choice of switch technology affects key response (the positive feedback that a key has been pressed) and pre travel (the distance needed to push the key to enter a character reliably). Newer keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve greater cost savings.\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Membrane keyboard ===\n{{main|Membrane keyboard}}\nThere are two types of membrane-based keyboards, flat-panel membrane keyboards and full-travel membrane keyboards:\n\nFlat-panel membrane keyboards are most often found on appliances like [[microwave oven]]s or [[photocopier]]s. A common design consists of three layers. The top layer has the labels printed on its front and conductive stripes printed on the back. Under this it has a spacer layer, which holds the front and back layer apart so that they do not normally make electrical contact. The back layer has conductive stripes printed perpendicularly to those of the front layer. When placed together, the stripes form a grid. When the user pushes down at a particular position, their finger pushes the front layer down through the spacer layer to close a circuit at one of the intersections of the grid. This indicates to the computer or keyboard control processor that a particular button has been pressed.\n\nGenerally, flat-panel membrane keyboards do not produce a noticeable physical feedback. Therefore, devices using these issue a beep or flash a light when the key is pressed. They are often used in harsh environments where water- or leak-proofing is desirable. Although used in the early days of the [[personal computer]] (on the [[Sinclair ZX80]], [[Sinclair ZX81|ZX81]] and [[Atari 400]]), they have been supplanted by the more tactile dome and mechanical switch keyboards.\n\nFull-travel membrane-based keyboards are the most common computer keyboards today. They have one-piece plastic keytop/switch plungers which press down on a membrane to actuate a contact in an electrical switch matrix.\n\n=== Dome-switch keyboard ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Computer keyboard]] -->\n[[File:Keyboard Construction Button Press.JPG|right|thumb|How a dome-switch keyboard works: Finger depresses the dome to complete the circuit]]\n[[File:Membrane keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|Dome switches mesh with keys (keyboard is upside down in this image)]]\n{{see also|Chiclet keyboard}}\nDome-switch keyboards are a hybrid of [[Membrane keyboard|flat-panel membrane]] and mechanical-switch keyboards. They bring two circuit board traces together under a [[rubber]] or silicone keypad using either metal \"dome\" switches or polyurethane formed domes. The metal dome switches are formed pieces of stainless steel that, when compressed, give the user a crisp, positive tactile feedback. These metal types of dome switches are very common, are usually reliable to over 5 million cycles, and can be plated in either nickel, silver or gold. The rubber dome switches, most commonly referred to as polydomes, are formed polyurethane domes where the inside bubble is coated in graphite. While polydomes are typically cheaper than metal domes, they lack the crisp snap of the metal domes, and usually have a lower life specification. Polydomes are considered very quiet, but purists tend to find them \"mushy\" because the collapsing dome does not provide as much positive response as metal domes. For either metal or polydomes, when a key is pressed, it collapses the dome, which connects the two circuit traces and completes the connection to enter the character. The pattern on the PC board is often gold-plated.\n\nBoth are common switch technologies used in mass market keyboards today. This type of switch technology happens to be most commonly used in handheld controllers, mobile phones, automotive, consumer electronics and medical devices. Dome-switch keyboards are also called direct-switch keyboards.\n\n=== Scissor-switch keyboard ===\n[[File:Scissor switch mechanism.svg|thumb|left|Scissor switch mechanism]]\nA special case of the computer keyboard dome-switch is the scissor-switch. The keys are attached to the keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in a \"scissor\"-like fashion, and snap to the keyboard and the key. It still uses rubber domes, but a special plastic [[scissors mechanism| 'scissors' mechanism]] links the [[keycap]] to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome with a much shorter travel than the typical rubber dome keyboard. Typically scissor-switch keyboards also employ 3-layer membranes as the electrical component of the switch. They also usually have a shorter total key travel distance (2&nbsp;mm instead of 3.5 \u2013 4&nbsp;mm for standard dome-switch keyswitches). This type of keyswitch is often found on the built-in keyboards on laptops and keyboards marketed as 'low-profile'. These keyboards are generally quiet and the keys require little force to press.\n\nScissor-switch keyboards are typically slightly more expensive. They are harder to clean (due to the limited movement of the keys and their multiple attachment points) but also less likely to get debris in them as the gaps between the keys are often smaller (as there is no need for extra room to allow for the 'wiggle' in the key, as typically found on a membrane keyboard).<ref>{{Citation | title = Keyboards | contribution = Mechanical vs membrane keyswitches | publisher = Ergo | place = [[Canada |CA]] | contribution-url = http://www.ergocanada.ca/ergo/keyboards/mechanical_vs_membrane_keyswitches.html}}.</ref>\n\n=== Capacitive keyboard ===\nIn this type of keyboard, pressing a key changes the capacitance of a pattern of capacitor pads. The pattern consists of two D-shaped capacitor pads for each switch, printed on a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and covered by a thin, insulating film of [[soldermask]] which acts as a [[dielectric]].\n\nDespite the sophistication of the concept, the mechanism of capacitive switching is physically simple. The movable part ends with a flat foam element about the size of an [[Tablet (pharmacy)|aspirin tablet]], finished with aluminum foil. Opposite the switch is a PCB with the capacitor pads. When the key is pressed, the foil tightly clings to the surface of the PCB, forming a [[series circuits|daisy chain]] of two capacitors between [[contact pad]]s and itself separated with thin soldermask, and thus \"shorting\" the [[contact pad]]s with an easily detectable drop of [[capacitive reactance]] between them. Usually this permits a pulse or pulse train to be sensed. Because the switch doesn't have an actual electrical contact, there is no debouncing necessary. The keys do not need to be fully pressed to be actuated, which enables some people to type faster. The sensor tells enough about the position of the key to allow the user to adjust actuation point (key sensitivity). This adjustment can be done with the help of the bundled software and individually for each key, if so implemented. <ref>Topre keyboard documentation, describing various features [http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/products/R2SA-US4-IV/index.html] and they software manual [http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/support/download/REALFORCE_Software_Manual_EN.pdf pdf]</ref>\n\nThe IBM [[Model F keyboard]] is mechanical-key design consisted of a buckling spring over a capacitive PCB, similarly to the later Model M keyboard that used a membrane in place of the PCB. \n\nThe most known company for their capacitive (electrostatic) switching technology is Topre Corporation<ref>[http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/ Topre Realforce website]</ref> from Japan. However, while their products are for sale on [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] (new and used), they are generally less available in large parts of the world. Topre's key switches use a spring below a rubber dome. The dome provides most of the force that keeps the key from being pressed, similar to a membrane keyboard, while the spring helps with the capacitive action. <ref>https://www.pcgamer.com/best-mechanical-switches-for-gaming/</ref>\n\n=== Mechanical-switch keyboard ===\n\nEach key on a mechanical-switch keyboard contains a complete switch underneath. Each switch is composed of a housing, a spring, and a stem, and sometimes other parts such as a separate tactile leaf or a clickbar. Switches come in three variants: '''linear''' with consistent resistance; '''tactile''' with a non-audible bump; and '''clicky''', a tactile with an audible click.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/|title=The Comparative Guide to Mechanical Switches |website=input.club|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref> Depending on the resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts of pressure to actuate and to bottom out. The shape of the stem as well as the design of the switch housing varies the actuation distance and travel distance of the switch. The amount of sound produced by actuation can also be changed by the addition of rubber dampeners. Like other types of keyboards, mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps, but replacing them is more common with mechanical keyboards due to common stem shapes.\n\nMechanical keyboards typically have a longer lifespan than membrane or dome-switch keyboards. Cherry MX switches, for example, have an expected lifespan of 50 million clicks per switch<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://cherryamericas.com/product/mx-series-2/ |website=Cherry Americas | title=MX series 2}}</ref>, while switches from [[Razer Inc.|Razer]] have a rated lifetime of 60 million clicks per switch.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://deskthority.net/wiki/Razer_switch | website=Deskthority wiki |title=Razer switch}}</ref>\n\nThe major current mechanical switch producer is [[Cherry (keyboards)|Cherry]]. [[Alps Electric]], a former major producer, ended production in the early 2000s,<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Mechanical 'Clicky' Keyboards Still Have Followers\n | website = slashdot.org\n | date = May 15, 2015\n | url = http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/05/15/1947238/mechanical-clicky-keyboards-still-have-followers-video\n}}</ref> but Alps style switches continue to be made by others companies as [[Matias Corporation|Matias]], Xiang Min(XM),<ref>[http://xiangmin.myweb.hinet.net Xiang Min website]</ref> Tai-Hao (APC)<ref>[http://www.tai-hao.com/ Tai-Hao website]</ref> and Hua-Jie (AK).<ref>[http://www.hua-jie.com Hua-Jie website]</ref> Other switch manufacturers include Gateron,<ref>[http://www.gateron.com/ Gateron website]</ref> Kaihua (Kailh),<ref>[http://www.kailh.com Kaihua website]</ref> Gaote (Outemu),<ref>[http://www.cngaote.com/ Gaote website]</ref> Greetech,<ref>[http://www.greetech.com/ Greetech website]</ref> TTC<ref>[http://www.ttc9.com TTC website]</ref> and [[Omron]].\n\n=== Buckling-spring keyboard ===\n[[File:Bucklingspring1-o.svg|thumb|Illustration from the original buckling spring {{US patent|4118611}}, issued to IBM in 1978.]]\nMany typists prefer [[buckling spring]] keyboards.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dansdata.com/ibmkeyboard.htm | journal = Dan's Data | type = review | title = IBM 42H1292 and 1391401 keyboards | origyear = 15 August 1999 | date = 13 Nov 2007 | access-date = 23 November 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131123005000/http://www.dansdata.com/ibmkeyboard.htm | archive-date = 23 November 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref>  The [[buckling spring]] mechanism (expired {{US patent |4118611}}) atop the switch is responsible for the tactile and aural response of the keyboard.

New [[Model M keyboard]]s continued to be manufactured for IBM by Lexmark until 1999, when [[Unicomp]] purchased the keyboard technology.\n\nToday, new buckling-spring keyboards are manufactured by Unicomp. Unicomp also repairs old IBM and Lexmark keyboards.\n\n=== Hall-effect keyboard ===\n[[Hall effect]] keyboards use [[magnet]]s and [[Hall effect sensor]]s instead of switches with mechanical contacts. When a key is depressed, it moves a magnet that is detected by a solid-state sensor. Because they require no physical contact for actuation, Hall-effect keyboards are extremely reliable and can accept millions of keystrokes before failing. They are used for ultra-high reliability applications such as nuclear power plants, aircraft cockpits, and critical industrial environments. They can easily be made totally waterproof, and can resist large amounts of dust and contaminants. Because a magnet and sensor are required for each key, as well as custom control electronics, they are expensive to manufacture.\n\n=== Laser projection keyboard ===\n\n{{main|Projection keyboard}}\n\nA laser projection device approximately the size of a computer mouse projects the outline of keyboard keys onto a flat surface, such as a table or desk. This type of keyboard is portable enough to be easily used with PDAs and cellphones, and many models have retractable cords and wireless capabilities. However, sudden or accidental disruption of the laser will register unwanted keystrokes. Also, if the laser malfunctions, the whole unit becomes useless, unlike conventional keyboards which can be used even if a variety of parts (such as the keycaps) are removed. This type of keyboard can be frustrating to use since it is susceptible to errors, even in the course of normal typing, and its complete lack of tactile feedback makes it even less user-friendly than the lowest quality membrane keyboards.\n\n=== Roll-up keyboard ===\n[[File:Foldable keyboard.jpg|thumb|right|Most keyboards are rigid, but this keyboard demonstrates one of many variations from the norm.]]\n{{see also|Roll-away computer}}\nKeyboards made of flexible silicone or polyurethane materials can roll up in a moderately tight bundle. Tightly folding the keyboard may damage the internal membrane circuits. When they are completely sealed in rubber they are water resistant. Like membrane keyboards, they are reported to be very hard to get used to, as there is little tactile feedback, and silicone will tend to attract dirt, dust, and hair.\n\n=== Optical keyboard technology ===\nAlso known as photo-optical keyboard, light responsive keyboard, photo-electric keyboard, and optical key actuation detection technology.\n\nOptical keyboard technology was introduced in 1962 by Harley E. Kelchner for use in a typewriter machine with the purpose of reducing the noise generating by actuating the typewriter keys.\n\nAn optical keyboard technology utilizes [[Light-emitting diode|light-emitting devices]] and [[Photoelectric sensor|photo sensors]] to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and sensors are located at the perimeter, mounted on a small [[Printed circuit board|PCB]]. The [[light]] is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior, and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical keyboards require at least 2 beams (most commonly a vertical beam and a horizontal beam) to determine the actuated key. Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per row of keys (most commonly a horizontal beam).\n\nThe mechanism of the optical keyboard is very simple \u2013 a light beam is sent from the emitter to the receiving sensor, and the actuated key blocks, [[Reflection (physics)|reflects]], [[Refraction|refracts]] or otherwise interacts with the beam, resulting in an identified key.\n\nSome earlier optical keyboards were limited in their structure and required special casing to block external light, no multi-key functionality was supported and the design was very limited to a thick rectangular case.\n\nThe advantages of optical keyboard technology are that it offers a real waterproof keyboard, resilient to dust and liquids; and it uses about 20% PCB volume, compared with membrane or dome switch keyboards, significantly reducing [[electronic waste]].\nAdditional advantages of optical keyboard technology over other keyboard technologies such as Hall effect, laser, roll-up, and transparent keyboards lie in cost (Hall effect keyboard) and feel \u2013 optical keyboard technology does not require different key mechanisms, and the tactile feel of typing has remained the same for over 60 years.\n\nThe specialist [[DataHand]] keyboard uses optical technology to sense keypresses with a single light beam and sensor per key. The keys are held in their rest position by [[magnet]]s; when the magnetic force is overcome to press a key, the optical path is unblocked and the keypress is registered.\n\n== Debouncing ==\nWhen striking a keyboard key, the key oscillates (or bounces) against its contacts several times before settling. When released, it oscillates again until it reverts to its rest state. Although it happens on such a small scale as to be invisible to the naked eye, it's sufficient for the computer to register multiple key strokes inadvertently.\n\nTo resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard \"[[Debounce#Contact_bounce|debounce]]s\" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one \"confirmed\" keystroke that (usually) corresponds to what is typically a solid contact. Early membrane keyboards had limited typing speed because they had to do significant debouncing. This was a noticeable problem on the [[ZX81]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n== Keycaps ==\n[[keycap|Keycaps]] are used on full-travel keyboards. While modern keycaps are typically surface-printed, they can also be [[Injection molding#Design|double-shot molded]], laser printed, sublimation printed, engraved, or they can be made of transparent material with printed paper inserts.\n\nThere are also keycaps which are thin shells that are placed over key bases. These were used on IBM PC keyboards.\n\n== Other parts of the PC keyboard ==\nThe modern PC keyboard also includes a control processor and indicator lights to provide feedback to the user about what state the keyboard is in. Depending on the sophistication of the controller's programming, the keyboard may also offer other special features. The processor is usually a single chip [[Intel 8048|8048]] [[microcontroller]] variant. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs and it processes the incoming keystrokes and sends the results down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to a receiver in the main computer box. It also controls the illumination of the \"[[caps lock]]\", \"[[num lock]]\" and \"[[scroll lock]]\" lights.\n\nA common test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the \"caps lock\" key. The keyboard sends the key code to the [[Device driver|keyboard driver]] running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the [[shift key|shift]], [[alt key|alt]] and [[control key|control]] state of the keyboard.\n\n== Keyboard switch matrix ==\n{{main |Keyboard matrix circuit}}\nThe keyboard switch matrix is often drawn with horizontal wires and vertical wires in a grid which is called a [[keyboard matrix (music)|matrix circuit]]. It has a switch at some or all intersections, much like a [[multiplexed display]]. Almost all keyboards have only the switch at each intersection, which causes \"ghost keys\" and \"key jamming\" when multiple keys are pressed ([[rollover (key) |rollover]]). Certain, often more expensive, keyboards have a diode between each intersection, allowing the keyboard microcontroller to accurately sense any number of simultaneous keys being pressed, without generating erroneous ghost keys.<ref>{{cite web | first =Dave | last = Dribin | title = Keyboard Matrix Help|url= http://www.dribin.org/dave/keyboard/}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of mechanical keyboards]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite news|last1=Schofield|first1=Jack|title=Which ThinkPad laptops have the best keyboards?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2014/may/09/which-thinkpad-laptops-have-the-best-keyboards|accessdate=4 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=9 May 2014}}\n*[https://gamehub.blog/razer-huntsman-elite-review/ Razer Huntsman Elite Keyboard Review] by GameHub at gamehub.blog\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keyboard Technology}}\n[[Category:Computer keyboards]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Technology of keyboards}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{lead too short|date=January 2015}}\n{{original research|date=January 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Keyboard Construction.JPG|right|thumb| Keyboard construction, in four layers, of a typical notebook computer keyboard]]\n[[Computer keyboard]]s can be classified by the [[switch]] technology that they use. Computer alphanumeric keyboards typically have 80 to 110 durable switches, generally one for each key. The choice of switch technology affects key response (the positive feedback that a key has been pressed) and pre travel (the distance needed to push the key to enter a character reliably). Newer keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve greater cost savings.\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Membrane keyboard ===\n{{main|Membrane keyboard}}\nThere are two types of membrane-based keyboards, flat-panel membrane keyboards and full-travel membrane keyboards:\n\nFlat-panel membrane keyboards are most often found on appliances like [[microwave oven]]s or [[photocopier]]s. A common design consists of three layers. The top layer has the labels printed on its front and conductive stripes printed on the back. Under this it has a spacer layer, which holds the front and back layer apart so that they do not normally make electrical contact. The back layer has conductive stripes printed perpendicularly to those of the front layer. When placed together, the stripes form a grid. When the user pushes down at a particular position, their finger pushes the front layer down through the spacer layer to close a circuit at one of the intersections of the grid. This indicates to the computer or keyboard control processor that a particular button has been pressed.\n\nGenerally, flat-panel membrane keyboards do not produce a noticeable physical feedback. Therefore, devices using these issue a beep or flash a light when the key is pressed. They are often used in harsh environments where water- or leak-proofing is desirable. Although used in the early days of the [[personal computer]] (on the [[Sinclair ZX80]], [[Sinclair ZX81|ZX81]] and [[Atari 400]]), they have been supplanted by the more tactile dome and mechanical switch keyboards.\n\nFull-travel membrane-based keyboards are the most common computer keyboards today. They have one-piece plastic keytop/switch plungers which press down on a membrane to actuate a contact in an electrical switch matrix.\n\n=== Dome-switch keyboard ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Computer keyboard]] -->\n[[File:Keyboard Construction Button Press.JPG|right|thumb|How a dome-switch keyboard works: Finger depresses the dome to complete the circuit]]\n[[File:Membrane keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|Dome switches mesh with keys (keyboard is upside down in this image)]]\n{{see also|Chiclet keyboard}}\nDome-switch keyboards are a hybrid of [[Membrane keyboard|flat-panel membrane]] and mechanical-switch keyboards. They bring two circuit board traces together under a [[rubber]] or silicone keypad using either metal \"dome\" switches or polyurethane formed domes. The metal dome switches are formed pieces of stainless steel that, when compressed, give the user a crisp, positive tactile feedback. These metal types of dome switches are very common, are usually reliable to over 5 million cycles, and can be plated in either nickel, silver or gold. The rubber dome switches, most commonly referred to as polydomes, are formed polyurethane domes where the inside bubble is coated in graphite. While polydomes are typically cheaper than metal domes, they lack the crisp snap of the metal domes, and usually have a lower life specification. Polydomes are considered very quiet, but purists tend to find them \"mushy\" because the collapsing dome does not provide as much positive response as metal domes. For either metal or polydomes, when a key is pressed, it collapses the dome, which connects the two circuit traces and completes the connection to enter the character. The pattern on the PC board is often gold-plated.\n\nBoth are common switch technologies used in mass market keyboards today. This type of switch technology happens to be most commonly used in handheld controllers, mobile phones, automotive, consumer electronics and medical devices. Dome-switch keyboards are also called direct-switch keyboards.\n\n=== Scissor-switch keyboard ===\n[[File:Scissor switch mechanism.svg|thumb|left|Scissor switch mechanism]]\nA special case of the computer keyboard dome-switch is the scissor-switch. The keys are attached to the keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in a \"scissor\"-like fashion, and snap to the keyboard and the key. It still uses rubber domes, but a special plastic [[scissors mechanism| 'scissors' mechanism]] links the [[keycap]] to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome with a much shorter travel than the typical rubber dome keyboard. Typically scissor-switch keyboards also employ 3-layer membranes as the electrical component of the switch. They also usually have a shorter total key travel distance (2&nbsp;mm instead of 3.5 \u2013 4&nbsp;mm for standard dome-switch keyswitches). This type of keyswitch is often found on the built-in keyboards on laptops and keyboards marketed as 'low-profile'. These keyboards are generally quiet and the keys require little force to press.\n\nScissor-switch keyboards are typically slightly more expensive. They are harder to clean (due to the limited movement of the keys and their multiple attachment points) but also less likely to get debris in them as the gaps between the keys are often smaller (as there is no need for extra room to allow for the 'wiggle' in the key, as typically found on a membrane keyboard).<ref>{{Citation | title = Keyboards | contribution = Mechanical vs membrane keyswitches | publisher = Ergo | place = [[Canada |CA]] | contribution-url = http://www.ergocanada.ca/ergo/keyboards/mechanical_vs_membrane_keyswitches.html}}.</ref>\n\n=== Capacitive keyboard ===\nIn this type of keyboard, pressing a key changes the capacitance of a pattern of capacitor pads. The pattern consists of two D-shaped capacitor pads for each switch, printed on a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and covered by a thin, insulating film of [[soldermask]] which acts as a [[dielectric]].\n\nDespite the sophistication of the concept, the mechanism of capacitive switching is physically simple. The movable part ends with a flat foam element about the size of an [[Tablet (pharmacy)|aspirin tablet]], finished with aluminum foil. Opposite the switch is a PCB with the capacitor pads. When the key is pressed, the foil tightly clings to the surface of the PCB, forming a [[series circuits|daisy chain]] of two capacitors between [[contact pad]]s and itself separated with thin soldermask, and thus \"shorting\" the [[contact pad]]s with an easily detectable drop of [[capacitive reactance]] between them. Usually this permits a pulse or pulse train to be sensed. Because the switch doesn't have an actual electrical contact, there is no debouncing necessary. The keys do not need to be fully pressed to be actuated, which enables some people to type faster. The sensor tells enough about the position of the key to allow the user to adjust actuation point (key sensitivity). This adjustment can be done with the help of the bundled software and individually for each key, if so implemented. <ref>Topre keyboard documentation, describing various features [http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/products/R2SA-US4-IV/index.html] and they software manual [http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/support/download/REALFORCE_Software_Manual_EN.pdf pdf]</ref>\n\nThe IBM [[Model F keyboard]] is mechanical-key design consisted of a buckling spring over a capacitive PCB, similarly to the later Model M keyboard that used a membrane in place of the PCB. \n\nThe most known company for their capacitive (electrostatic) switching technology is Topre Corporation<ref>[http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/ Topre Realforce website]</ref> from Japan. However, while their products are for sale on [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] (new and used), they are generally less available in large parts of the world. Topre's key switches use a spring below a rubber dome. The dome provides most of the force that keeps the key from being pressed, similar to a membrane keyboard, while the spring helps with the capacitive action. <ref>https://www.pcgamer.com/best-mechanical-switches-for-gaming/</ref>\n\n=== Mechanical-switch keyboard ===\n\nEach key on a mechanical-switch keyboard contains a complete switch underneath. Each switch is composed of a housing, a spring, and a stem, and sometimes other parts such as a separate tactile leaf or a clickbar. Switches come in three variants: '''linear''' with consistent resistance; '''tactile''' with a non-audible bump; and '''clicky''', a tactile with an audible click.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/|title=The Comparative Guide to Mechanical Switches |website=input.club|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref> Depending on the resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts of pressure to actuate and to bottom out. The shape of the stem as well as the design of the switch housing varies the actuation distance and travel distance of the switch. The amount of sound produced by actuation can also be changed by the addition of rubber dampeners. Like other types of keyboards, mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps, but replacing them is more common with mechanical keyboards due to common stem shapes.\n\nMechanical keyboards typically have a longer lifespan than membrane or dome-switch keyboards. Cherry MX switches, for example, have an expected lifespan of 50 million clicks per switch<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://cherryamericas.com/product/mx-series-2/ |website=Cherry Americas | title=MX series 2}}</ref>, while switches from [[Razer Inc.|Razer]] have a rated lifetime of 60 million clicks per switch.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://deskthority.net/wiki/Razer_switch | website=Deskthority wiki |title=Razer switch}}</ref>\n\nThe major current mechanical switch producer is [[Cherry (keyboards)|Cherry]].

New [[Model M keyboard]]s continued to be manufactured for IBM by Lexmark until 1999, when [[Unicomp]] purchased the keyboard technology.\n\nToday, new buckling-spring keyboards are manufactured by Unicomp. Unicomp also repairs old IBM and Lexmark keyboards.\n\n=== Hall-effect keyboard ===\n[[Hall effect]] keyboards use [[magnet]]s and [[Hall effect sensor]]s instead of switches with mechanical contacts. When a key is depressed, it moves a magnet that is detected by a solid-state sensor. Because they require no physical contact for actuation, Hall-effect keyboards are extremely reliable and can accept millions of keystrokes before failing. They are used for ultra-high reliability applications such as nuclear power plants, aircraft cockpits, and critical industrial environments. They can easily be made totally waterproof, and can resist large amounts of dust and contaminants. Because a magnet and sensor are required for each key, as well as custom control electronics, they are expensive to manufacture.\n\n=== Laser projection keyboard ===\n\n{{main|Projection keyboard}}\n\nA laser projection device approximately the size of a computer mouse projects the outline of keyboard keys onto a flat surface, such as a table or desk.

It is derived from the [[Bulgarian language|Old Bulgarian]] word for \"[[marketplace]]\", {{lang|bg|\u0442\u044a\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0449\u0435}} \n({{IPA-bg|t\u0250r\u02c8\u0261\u0254vi\u0283t\u025b|pron}}), referring to the place rather than the market itself.\n\nThe name is found in placenames not only in South Slavic areas (Bulgarian [[Targovishte|\u0422\u044a\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0449\u0435]], Serbian [[Trgovi\u0161te|\u0422\u0440\u0433\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0435]] and Croatian ''[[Veliko Trgovi\u0161\u0107e]]''), but also in West Slavic such as Slovakian ''[[Trhovi\u0161te]]'' or Polish ''[[Targowica|Targowica]]''. Additionally, places with the same name are found in Romania, in the regions of [[Oltenia]], [[Banat]], and [[Moldavia]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=295}}\n\nThe Romanian and Bulgarian towns with the same name are also [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]].\n\n[[File:Flickr - fusion-of-horizons - Mitropolia Veche a \u021a\u0103rii Rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti.jpg|thumb|Interior of the Ascension Cathedral]]\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\n\nThe area of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te which was first inhabited is located where the [[Saint Nicholas-Geartoglu Church]] and [[Stelea Veche Church]] stand today. It was in this place that the first fortifications were built: a small stone building surrounded by a brick [[wall]] and a [[moat]], probably belonging to a local ruler.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=295}} However, archaeological evidence is scarce and it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when it was erected.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=295}}\n\n===Saxon colony===\n\nAnother nucleus of the city was built by [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon colonists]] from [[Transylvania]], in the area where the Catholic [[Saint Mary Church (T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te)|Saint Mary Church]] is located, a church that was built during the early years of the colony.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=296}} A local tradition says that the church was built in 1300.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=296}} The colonists came around the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century, the same period that [[C\u00e2mpulung]] was colonized.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=296}} There is archeological evidence that the land occupied by the new colonists had been previously inhabited by locals, which leads to the conclusion that it had been approved by the local ruler.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=296}}\n\nThe colonists influenced the local administration, as T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te was the only town in Wallachia that had Transylvanian organization features, having official titles such as ''[[bir\u0103u]]'' and ''[[folnog]]'', which are found in documents together with local officials, like ''[[vornic]]'' and ''[[pristav]]''.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=297}} The town had a [[Watchman (law enforcement)|night watch]] which was also known by a Latin term (''viglu'' < ''vigilia'') instead of the local terms such ''paz\u0103'' or ''straj\u0103''.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=297}}\n\nAfter 1400, the town began to grow and become denser. Both Saxon part (around the stronghold) and in the Romanian part, there were several large dwellings with [[Basement|cellar]]s and [[cocklestove]]s similar to those found in Central Europe. The wealth is also known based on the number of [[treasure trove]]s discovered, the largest being a [[hoard]] of 6284 silver coins, found in the Saxon part of the town.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=297}} The town gravitated around the Saxon part, this being valid until the Saxon community began its decline during the 16th century.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=298}}\n\n===Capital of Wallachia===\n{{Medieval capitals of Romania}}\nIn the 14th century, the capital of Wallachia was [[Curtea de Arge\u0219]], however, due to T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te's economic growth, toward the end of the century, it became a secondary residence of the Wallachian hospodar. In 1396, Bavarian traveler [[Johann Schiltberger]] mentions both Curtea de Arge\u0219 and T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te as capitals of Wallachia.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=298}}\nWhile [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea I]] lived in Curtea de Arge\u0219, [[Michael I of Wallachia|Michael I]], Mircea's son and co-prince lived in T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, where he continued to live even as a single ruler. [[Dan II of Wallachia|Dan II]] preferred Curtea de Arge\u0219 and he was the last hospodar to rule from that city, the court being finally moved to T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te by [[Alexander I Aldea|Alexandru Aldea]] in 1431.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=298}}\n\n[[File:RO DB Targoviste - Buzau and Braila gate 2.jpg|thumb|Bucharest Gate]]\nThroughout the period it was the capital of Wallachia, the {{ill|Princely Court in T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te|ro|Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te}} (''Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te'') had been constantly refurbished and extended. The compound was surrounded by [[stone wall]]s and a [[moat]] and a new church and a tower had been built.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=298}} [[Vlad III Dracula]] (\"the Impaler\") later added the [[Chindia Tower]], now a symbol of the city.\n\nStarting with 1465, for the next two centuries, the rulers alternated the capital between T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te and Bucharest, often on political reasons, as the former was preferred by the rulers who were more friendly toward Transylvania and the King of Hungary.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=299}} Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te was a major trade hub, especially with Poland, [[Bra\u0219ov]] and [[Sibiu]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=299-300}}\n\nBy the 16th century, the Romanians became majority in the city, as some Saxons left for Transylvania and others were assimilated. Greeks merchants began to settle in the city, especially after 1500, while Greek monks settled in the nearby [[Dealu Monastery|Dealu]] and [[Panaghia Monastery|Panaghia]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=300}}\n\nAs the capital of Wallachia, T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te faced numerous sieges and invasions. In 1395, it was sieged and set on fire by [[Bayezid I]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=302}} In 1457, the townsfolk of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te were punished by Vlad III Dracula for their involvement in the assassination of his brother: the elite of city was killed, while the young people were sent to work at his [[Poenari Castle]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=302}}\n\nThe Ottoman invasion of 1462 did not reach the city, being prevented by Vlad III through [[The Night Attack]]. In 1476, the city was taken by [[Stephen V B\u00e1thory]] following a fifteen-day siege intended to restore Vlad to the throne. Several other battles were fought near the city during the rules of [[Neagoe Basarab]] and [[Radu of Afuma\u021bi]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=302}}\n\nIn 1597, the Hajduks of [[Mihai Viteazul]] and [[Starina Novak]] fought and won a decisive battle{{which|date=October 2019}} against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te.\n\n===Decline===\n\nAfter the capital was finally moved to [[Bucharest]] during the rule of [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]] (1688-1714), T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te lost its importance, decaying economically as its population decreased.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Strada Alexandru Ioan Cuza, T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te.JPG|thumb|[[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] Street]]\nT\u00e2rgovi\u0219te was the site of the [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu|trial and execution of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu and his wife Elena]] on 25 December 1989 during the [[Romanian Revolution]].\n\n==Geography==\nOne village, Priseaca, is administered by the city.\n\n==Population==\nIn 2011, there were 79,610 inhabitants.

It was in this place that the first fortifications were built: a small stone building surrounded by a brick [[wall]] and a [[moat]], probably belonging to a local ruler.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=295}} However, archaeological evidence is scarce and it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when it was erected.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=295}}\n\n===Saxon colony===\n\nAnother nucleus of the city was built by [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon colonists]] from [[Transylvania]], in the area where the Catholic [[Saint Mary Church (T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te)|Saint Mary Church]] is located, a church that was built during the early years of the colony.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=296}} A local tradition says that the church was built in 1300.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=296}} The colonists came around the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century, the same period that [[C\u00e2mpulung]] was colonized.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=296}} There is archeological evidence that the land occupied by the new colonists had been previously inhabited by locals, which leads to the conclusion that it had been approved by the local ruler.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=296}}\n\nThe colonists influenced the local administration, as T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te was the only town in Wallachia that had Transylvanian organization features, having official titles such as ''[[bir\u0103u]]'' and ''[[folnog]]'', which are found in documents together with local officials, like ''[[vornic]]'' and ''[[pristav]]''.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=297}} The town had a [[Watchman (law enforcement)|night watch]] which was also known by a Latin term (''viglu'' < ''vigilia'') instead of the local terms such ''paz\u0103'' or ''straj\u0103''.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=297}}\n\nAfter 1400, the town began to grow and become denser. Both Saxon part (around the stronghold) and in the Romanian part, there were several large dwellings with [[Basement|cellar]]s and [[cocklestove]]s similar to those found in Central Europe. The wealth is also known based on the number of [[treasure trove]]s discovered, the largest being a [[hoard]] of 6284 silver coins, found in the Saxon part of the town.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=297}} The town gravitated around the Saxon part, this being valid until the Saxon community began its decline during the 16th century.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=298}}\n\n===Capital of Wallachia===\n{{Medieval capitals of Romania}}\nIn the 14th century, the capital of Wallachia was [[Curtea de Arge\u0219]], however, due to T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te's economic growth, toward the end of the century, it became a secondary residence of the Wallachian hospodar. In 1396, Bavarian traveler [[Johann Schiltberger]] mentions both Curtea de Arge\u0219 and T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te as capitals of Wallachia.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=298}}\nWhile [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea I]] lived in Curtea de Arge\u0219, [[Michael I of Wallachia|Michael I]], Mircea's son and co-prince lived in T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, where he continued to live even as a single ruler. [[Dan II of Wallachia|Dan II]] preferred Curtea de Arge\u0219 and he was the last hospodar to rule from that city, the court being finally moved to T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te by [[Alexander I Aldea|Alexandru Aldea]] in 1431.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=298}}\n\n[[File:RO DB Targoviste - Buzau and Braila gate 2.jpg|thumb|Bucharest Gate]]\nThroughout the period it was the capital of Wallachia, the {{ill|Princely Court in T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te|ro|Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te}} (''Curtea Domneasc\u0103 din T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te'') had been constantly refurbished and extended. The compound was surrounded by [[stone wall]]s and a [[moat]] and a new church and a tower had been built.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=298}} [[Vlad III Dracula]] (\"the Impaler\") later added the [[Chindia Tower]], now a symbol of the city.\n\nStarting with 1465, for the next two centuries, the rulers alternated the capital between T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te and Bucharest, often on political reasons, as the former was preferred by the rulers who were more friendly toward Transylvania and the King of Hungary.{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=299}} Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te was a major trade hub, especially with Poland, [[Bra\u0219ov]] and [[Sibiu]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=299-300}}\n\nBy the 16th century, the Romanians became majority in the city, as some Saxons left for Transylvania and others were assimilated. Greeks merchants began to settle in the city, especially after 1500, while Greek monks settled in the nearby [[Dealu Monastery|Dealu]] and [[Panaghia Monastery|Panaghia]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=300}}\n\nAs the capital of Wallachia, T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te faced numerous sieges and invasions. In 1395, it was sieged and set on fire by [[Bayezid I]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=302}} In 1457, the townsfolk of T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te were punished by Vlad III Dracula for their involvement in the assassination of his brother: the elite of city was killed, while the young people were sent to work at his [[Poenari Castle]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=302}}\n\nThe Ottoman invasion of 1462 did not reach the city, being prevented by Vlad III through [[The Night Attack]]. In 1476, the city was taken by [[Stephen V B\u00e1thory]] following a fifteen-day siege intended to restore Vlad to the throne. Several other battles were fought near the city during the rules of [[Neagoe Basarab]] and [[Radu of Afuma\u021bi]].{{sfn|R\u0103dvan|p=302}}\n\nIn 1597, the Hajduks of [[Mihai Viteazul]] and [[Starina Novak]] fought and won a decisive battle{{which|date=October 2019}} against the [[Ottoman Empire]] in T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te.\n\n===Decline===\n\nAfter the capital was finally moved to [[Bucharest]] during the rule of [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]] (1688-1714), T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te lost its importance, decaying economically as its population decreased.\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Strada Alexandru Ioan Cuza, T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te.JPG|thumb|[[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] Street]]\nT\u00e2rgovi\u0219te was the site of the [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceau\u0219escu|trial and execution of Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu and his wife Elena]] on 25 December 1989 during the [[Romanian Revolution]].\n\n==Geography==\nOne village, Priseaca, is administered by the city.\n\n==Population==\nIn 2011, there were 79,610 inhabitants.

Its total area is {{convert|89.69|sqkm|sqmi}}.\n\n==Geography==\nLocated in northwestern Saitama Prefecture, Honj\u014d is on the upper reaches of the [[Tone River]].\n\n==Surrounding municipalities==\n* [[Saitama Prefecture]]\n** [[Fukaya, Saitama| Fukaya]]\n** [[Kamisato, Saitama|Kamisato]]\n** [[Kamikawa, Saitama|Kamikawa]]\n** [[Nagatoro, Saitama|Nagatoro]]\n** [[Minano, Saitama|Minano]]\n*[[Gunma Prefecture]]\n** [[Isesaki, Gunma|Isesaki]]\n** [[Tamamura, Gunma|Tamamura]]\n\n==History==\nThe area of Honj\u014d has been inhabited since prehistoric times and numerous [[kofun|burial mounds]] from the [[Kofun period]] have been found in the area. During the [[Kamakura period]], the area was dominated by the Honj\u014d clan, who continued to rule over a [[castle town]] and eventually the short-lived Honj\u014d Domain during the early [[Tokugawa shogunate]] of the [[Edo period]]. After the suppression of Honj\u014d Domain, the town continued to prosper as [[Honj\u014d-juku]], a [[shukuba|post station]] on the [[Nakasendo]] highway. During the late Edo period and early [[Meiji period]], the area was noted for [[sericulture]]. The modern town of Honj\u014d was created within [[Kodama District, Saitama|Kodama District]], Saitama with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Honj\u014d was elevated to city status on July 1, 1954 by merging with neighboring Fujita, Nitte, Asahi and Kitaizumi villages.\n\nOn January 10, 2006, the town of [[Kodama, Saitama|Kodama]] was merged into Honj\u014d.\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Honj\u014d is based on light and precision manufacturing and agriculture, and the city is also a regional commercial center.\n\n==Education==\n*[[Waseda University]] has a campus at Honj\u014d\n*Honj\u014d has 13 elementary schools, four middle schools, two combined middle/high schools and four high schools.\n*International schools:  Escola Intercultural Unificada Arco \u00cdris - [[Brazilian schools in Japan|Brazilian school]]<ref name=Brazilschools>\"[http://www.brasemb.or.jp/portugues/community/school.php Escolas Brasileiras Homologadas no Jap\u00e3o]\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20151018083340/http://www.brasemb.or.jp/portugues/community/school.php Archive]).

During the [[Kamakura period]], the area was dominated by the Honj\u014d clan, who continued to rule over a [[castle town]] and eventually the short-lived Honj\u014d Domain during the early [[Tokugawa shogunate]] of the [[Edo period]]. After the suppression of Honj\u014d Domain, the town continued to prosper as [[Honj\u014d-juku]], a [[shukuba|post station]] on the [[Nakasendo]] highway. During the late Edo period and early [[Meiji period]], the area was noted for [[sericulture]]. The modern town of Honj\u014d was created within [[Kodama District, Saitama|Kodama District]], Saitama with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Honj\u014d was elevated to city status on July 1, 1954 by merging with neighboring Fujita, Nitte, Asahi and Kitaizumi villages.\n\nOn January 10, 2006, the town of [[Kodama, Saitama|Kodama]] was merged into Honj\u014d.\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Honj\u014d is based on light and precision manufacturing and agriculture, and the city is also a regional commercial center.\n\n==Education==\n*[[Waseda University]] has a campus at Honj\u014d\n*Honj\u014d has 13 elementary schools, four middle schools, two combined middle/high schools and four high schools.\n*International schools:  Escola Intercultural Unificada Arco \u00cdris - [[Brazilian schools in Japan|Brazilian school]]<ref name=Brazilschools>\"[http://www.brasemb.or.jp/portugues/community/school.php Escolas Brasileiras Homologadas no Jap\u00e3o]\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20151018083340/http://www.brasemb.or.jp/portugues/community/school.php Archive]).

''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', which continues the story, was released six months after ''Reloaded'', in November 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nSix months after the events of ''[[The Matrix]]'', [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] are now romantically involved. [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] receives a message from Captain [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]] of the ''Logos'' calling an emergency meeting of all ships of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]]. Zion has confirmed [[The_Animatrix#Final Flight of the Osiris|the last transmission of the ''Osiris'']]: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Lock|Commander Lock]] orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain to contact the [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]]. As the ''Caduceus'' receives a message from the Oracle, one of the ''Caduceus'' crew, [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]], encounters [[Agent Smith|Smith]], who reveals that his previous encounter with Neo severed his connection with the Matrix and is now a rogue program, then absorbs his avatar. Smith then uses the phone line to leave the Matrix and gain control of Bane's real body.\n\nIn Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. In the Matrix, Neo meets the Oracle's bodyguard [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]], who leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that this is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix with the help of the [[Keymaker (The Matrix)|Keymaker]]. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo but fails, prompting a battle between Smith's clones and Neo. Neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers.\n\nNeo, Morpheus, and Trinity visit the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]], who is imprisoning the Keymaker. The Merovingian, a rogue Matrix program with his own agenda, refuses to let him go. His wife [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]], seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, leads the trio to the Keymaker. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee while Neo holds off the Merovingian's henchmen. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker, pursued by several Agents and the Merovingian's chief henchmen, [[Twins (The Matrix)|the Twins]]. After a long chase, Trinity escapes, Morpheus defeats the Twins, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson.\n\nThe crews of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', ''Vigilant'', and ''Logos'' help the Keymaker and Neo reach the Source. The ''Logos'' crew must destroy a power plant and the ''Vigilant'' crew must disable a back-up power station, to prevent a security system from being triggered, allowing Neo to open the door to the Source. Haunted by a vision of Trinity's death, Neo asks her to remain on the ''Nebuchadnezzar''.\n\nThe ''Logos'' succeeds, while the ''Vigilant'' is destroyed by a Sentinel, killing everyone on board. Trinity replaces the ''Vigilant'' crew and completes their mission. However, Agent Thompson corners her and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, the Smiths ambush them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, but the Smiths shoot him dead as he closes the door.\n\nNeo meets a program called the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]], the creator of the Matrix. The Architect explains that Neo is himself a program and an intentional part of the Matrix, which is now in its sixth iteration. Neo is meant to stop the Matrix's fatal system crash that naturally recurs due to the concept of human choice within it. As with the five previous Ones, Neo has a choice: either return to the Source to reboot the Matrix and pick survivors to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, as his predecessors all did, or cause the Matrix to crash and kill everyone connected to it, which would mean humanity's extinction when Zion is destroyed. Neo learns of Trinity's situation and chooses to save her instead of returning to the Source, to which the Architect responds dismissively.\n\nTrinity is shot as she and Agent Thompson fall off a building. Before she hits the ground, Neo catches her. He then removes the bullet from her heart and revives her. They return to the real world, where Sentinels attack them. The ''Nebuchadnezzar'' is destroyed, but the crew escape. Neo displays a new ability to disable the machines with his thoughts, but falls into a coma from the effort. The crew are picked up by another ship, the ''Hammer''. Its captain, Roland, reveals the other ships were wiped out by the machines after someone activated an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] too early, and that they found only one survivor: the Smith-possessed Bane.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]]\n* [[Carrie-Anne Moss]] as [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]\n* [[Hugo Weaving]] as [[Agent Smith]]\n* [[Jada Pinkett Smith]] as [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]]\n* [[Harold Perrineau]] as Link\n* [[Randall Duk Kim]] as [[Keymaker|The Keymaker]]\n* [[Gloria Foster]] as [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|The Oracle]]\n* [[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]]\n* [[Lambert Wilson]] as The Merovingian\n* [[Helmut Bakaitis]] as [[Architect (The Matrix)|The Architect]]\n* Neil and Adrian Rayment as [[Twins (The Matrix)|Twins]]\n* [[Daniel Bernhardt]] as Agent Johnson\n* [[Leigh Whannell]] as Axel\n* [[Collin Chou]] as [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]]\n* [[Nona Gaye]] as Zee\n* [[Gina Torres]] as Cas\n* Donald Anjaya Batte as Vector\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as Councillor Hamann\n* [[Roy Jones Jr.]] as Captain Ballard\n* David A.

The [[freeway]] chase and \"Burly Brawl\" scenes were filmed at the decommissioned [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in [[Alameda, California]]. The producers constructed a 1.5-mile freeway on the old runways specifically for the film. Some portions of the chase were also filmed in [[Oakland, California]], and the tunnel shown briefly is the [[Webster Tube]], which connects Oakland and Alameda. Some post-production editing was also done in old aircraft hangars on the base.

To develop technologies for the film, Warner Bros. launched ESC Entertainment.<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" >{{cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html | title=Matrix<sup>2</sup> | magazine=Wired | accessdate=December 25, 2012 | author=Silberman, Steve}}</ref> The ESC team tried to figure out how to bring the Wachowskis' vision to the screen, but because bullet time required arrays of carefully aligned cameras and months of planning, even for a brief scene featuring two or three actors, a scene like the Burly Brawl seemed almost impossible as envisioned and could take years to composite. Eventually [[John Gaeta]] realized that the technology he and his crew had developed for ''The Matrix''{{'}}s [[bullet time]] was no longer sufficient and concluded they needed a [[virtuality|virtual]] [[camera]] (in other words, a [[simulation]] of a camera). Having before used real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models in ''The Matrix'', the team started digitizing all data, such as scenes, characters' motions, or even the reflectivity of Neo's [[cassock]]. The [[reflection (computer graphics)|reflectivity]] of objects needs to be [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|captured and simulated adequately]] and [[Paul Debevec]] et al. captured the reflectance of the [[human face]] and Borshukov's work was strongly based on the findings of Debevec et al. They developed \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution, then capture expressions from Reeves and Weaving using [[Motion capture#Markerless|dense aka. markerless capture]] and [[multi-camera setup]] (similar to the bullet time rig) [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] capture [[Art techniques and materials|technique]] called [[optical flow]].<ref name=\"Deb2005\">{{cite book | last = Debevec | first = Paul | authorlink = |author2=J.

For many of the pivotal action sequences, such as the \"Burly Brawl\", he collaborated with [[Juno Reactor]]. Some of the collaborative cues by Davis and Juno Reactor are extensions of material by Juno Reactor; for example, a version of \"Komit\" featuring Davis' strings is used during a flying sequence, and \"Burly Brawl\" is essentially a combination of Davis' unused \"Multiple Replication\" and a piece similar to Juno Reactor's \"Masters of the Universe\". One of the collaborations, \"[[Mona Lisa Overdrive (song)|Mona Lisa Overdrive]]\", is titled in reference to the [[cyberpunk]] [[Mona Lisa Overdrive|novel of the same name]] by [[William Gibson]], a major influence on the directors.\n\n[[Leitmotif]]s established in ''The Matrix'' return \u2014 such as the Matrix main theme, Neo and Trinity's love theme, the Sentinel's theme, Neo's flying theme, and a more frequent use of the four-note Agent Smith theme \u2014 and others used in ''Revolutions'' are established.\n\nAs with its predecessor, many tracks by external musicians are featured in the movie, its closing credits, and the soundtrack album, some of which were written for the film. Many of the musicians featured, for example [[Rob Zombie]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], had also appeared on the soundtrack for ''The Matrix''. [[Rob Dougan]] also re-contributed, licensing the instrumental version of \"[[Furious Angels]]\", as well as being commissioned to provide an original track, ultimately scoring the battle in the Merovingian's chateau. A remixed version of \"[[Slap It (Fluke song)|Slap It]]\" by electronic artist [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]] \u2014 listed on the soundtrack as \"Zion\" \u2014 was used during the rave scene.\n\n[[Linkin Park]] contributed their instrumental song \"Session\" to the film as well, although it did not appear during the course of the film. [[P.O.D.]] composed a song called \"[[Sleeping Awake]]\", with a [[music video]] which focused heavily on Neo, as well as many images that were part of the film.

''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'', which continues the story, was released six months after ''Reloaded'', in November 2003.\n\n==Plot==\nSix months after the events of ''[[The Matrix]]'', [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]] and [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]] are now romantically involved. [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] receives a message from Captain [[Niobe (The Matrix)|Niobe]] of the ''Logos'' calling an emergency meeting of all ships of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]]. Zion has confirmed [[The_Animatrix#Final Flight of the Osiris|the last transmission of the ''Osiris'']]: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. [[List of minor characters in the Matrix series#Lock|Commander Lock]] orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught, but Morpheus asks one ship to remain to contact the [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|Oracle]]. As the ''Caduceus'' receives a message from the Oracle, one of the ''Caduceus'' crew, [[Bane (The Matrix)|Bane]], encounters [[Agent Smith|Smith]], who reveals that his previous encounter with Neo severed his connection with the Matrix and is now a rogue program, then absorbs his avatar. Smith then uses the phone line to leave the Matrix and gain control of Bane's real body.\n\nIn Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. In the Matrix, Neo meets the Oracle's bodyguard [[Seraph (The Matrix)|Seraph]], who leads him to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that this is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix with the help of the [[Keymaker (The Matrix)|Keymaker]]. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other inhabitants of the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo but fails, prompting a battle between Smith's clones and Neo. Neo manages to defend himself, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers.\n\nNeo, Morpheus, and Trinity visit the [[Merovingian (The Matrix)|Merovingian]], who is imprisoning the Keymaker. The Merovingian, a rogue Matrix program with his own agenda, refuses to let him go. His wife [[Persephone (The Matrix)|Persephone]], seeking revenge on her husband for his infidelity, leads the trio to the Keymaker. Morpheus, Trinity, and the Keymaker flee while Neo holds off the Merovingian's henchmen. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker, pursued by several Agents and the Merovingian's chief henchmen, [[Twins (The Matrix)|the Twins]]. After a long chase, Trinity escapes, Morpheus defeats the Twins, and Neo saves Morpheus and the Keymaker from Agent Johnson.\n\nThe crews of the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', ''Vigilant'', and ''Logos'' help the Keymaker and Neo reach the Source. The ''Logos'' crew must destroy a power plant and the ''Vigilant'' crew must disable a back-up power station, to prevent a security system from being triggered, allowing Neo to open the door to the Source. Haunted by a vision of Trinity's death, Neo asks her to remain on the ''Nebuchadnezzar''.\n\nThe ''Logos'' succeeds, while the ''Vigilant'' is destroyed by a Sentinel, killing everyone on board. Trinity replaces the ''Vigilant'' crew and completes their mission. However, Agent Thompson corners her and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus, and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, the Smiths ambush them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, but the Smiths shoot him dead as he closes the door.\n\nNeo meets a program called the [[Architect (The Matrix)|Architect]], the creator of the Matrix. The Architect explains that Neo is himself a program and an intentional part of the Matrix, which is now in its sixth iteration. Neo is meant to stop the Matrix's fatal system crash that naturally recurs due to the concept of human choice within it. As with the five previous Ones, Neo has a choice: either return to the Source to reboot the Matrix and pick survivors to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, as his predecessors all did, or cause the Matrix to crash and kill everyone connected to it, which would mean humanity's extinction when Zion is destroyed. Neo learns of Trinity's situation and chooses to save her instead of returning to the Source, to which the Architect responds dismissively.\n\nTrinity is shot as she and Agent Thompson fall off a building. Before she hits the ground, Neo catches her. He then removes the bullet from her heart and revives her. They return to the real world, where Sentinels attack them.

The [[freeway]] chase and \"Burly Brawl\" scenes were filmed at the decommissioned [[Naval Air Station Alameda]] in [[Alameda, California]]. The producers constructed a 1.5-mile freeway on the old runways specifically for the film. Some portions of the chase were also filmed in [[Oakland, California]], and the tunnel shown briefly is the [[Webster Tube]], which connects Oakland and Alameda. Some post-production editing was also done in old aircraft hangars on the base as well. The city of [[Akron, Ohio]] was willing to give full access to [[Ohio State Route 59|Route 59]], the stretch of freeway known as the \"Innerbelt\", for filming of the freeway chase when it was under consideration.

To develop technologies for the film, Warner Bros. launched ESC Entertainment.<ref name=\"Wired VFX\" >{{cite magazine | url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.05/matrix2_pr.html | title=Matrix<sup>2</sup> | magazine=Wired | accessdate=December 25, 2012 | author=Silberman, Steve}}</ref> The ESC team tried to figure out how to bring the Wachowskis' vision to the screen, but because bullet time required arrays of carefully aligned cameras and months of planning, even for a brief scene featuring two or three actors, a scene like the Burly Brawl seemed almost impossible as envisioned and could take years to composite. Eventually [[John Gaeta]] realized that the technology he and his crew had developed for ''The Matrix''{{'}}s [[bullet time]] was no longer sufficient and concluded they needed a [[virtuality|virtual]] [[camera]] (in other words, a [[simulation]] of a camera). Having before used real photographs of buildings as texture for 3D models in ''The Matrix'', the team started digitizing all data, such as scenes, characters' motions, or even the reflectivity of Neo's [[cassock]]. The [[reflection (computer graphics)|reflectivity]] of objects needs to be [[Bidirectional scattering distribution function|captured and simulated adequately]] and [[Paul Debevec]] et al. captured the reflectance of the [[human face]] and Borshukov's work was strongly based on the findings of Debevec et al. They developed \"Universal Capture\", a process which samples and stores facial details and expressions at high resolution, then capture expressions from Reeves and Weaving using [[Motion capture#Markerless|dense aka. markerless capture]] and [[multi-camera setup]] (similar to the bullet time rig) [[photogrammetry|photogrammetric]] capture [[Art techniques and materials|technique]] called [[optical flow]].<ref name=\"Deb2005\">{{cite book | last = Debevec | first = Paul | authorlink = |author2=J.

With this collected wealth of data and the right algorithms, they finally were able to create [[virtual cinematography]] in which characters, locations, and events can all be created digitally and viewed through virtual cameras, eliminating the restrictions of real cameras, years of compositing data, and replacing the use of still camera arrays or, in some scenes, cameras altogether.

For many of the pivotal action sequences, such as the \"Burly Brawl\", he collaborated with [[Juno Reactor]]. Some of the collaborative cues by Davis and Juno Reactor are extensions of material by Juno Reactor; for example, a version of \"Komit\" featuring Davis' strings is used during a flying sequence, and \"Burly Brawl\" is essentially a combination of Davis' unused \"Multiple Replication\" and a piece similar to Juno Reactor's \"Masters of the Universe\". One of the collaborations, \"[[Mona Lisa Overdrive (song)|Mona Lisa Overdrive]]\", is titled in reference to the [[cyberpunk]] [[Mona Lisa Overdrive|novel of the same name]] by [[William Gibson]], a major influence on the directors.\n\n[[Leitmotif]]s established in ''The Matrix'' return \u2014 such as the Matrix main theme, Neo and Trinity's love theme, the Sentinel's theme, Neo's flying theme, and a more frequent use of the four-note Agent Smith theme \u2014 and others used in ''Revolutions'' are established.\n\nAs with its predecessor, many tracks by external musicians are featured in the movie, its closing credits, and the soundtrack album, some of which were written for the film. Many of the musicians featured, for example [[Rob Zombie]], [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], had also appeared on the soundtrack for ''The Matrix''. [[Rob Dougan]] also re-contributed, licensing the instrumental version of \"[[Furious Angels]]\", as well as being commissioned to provide an original track, ultimately scoring the battle in the Merovingian's chateau. A remixed version of \"[[Slap It (Fluke song)|Slap It]]\" by electronic artist [[Fluke (band)|Fluke]] \u2014 listed on the soundtrack as \"Zion\" \u2014 was used during the rave scene.\n\n[[Linkin Park]] contributed their instrumental song \"Session\" to the film as well, although it did not appear during the course of the film. [[P.O.D.]] composed a song called \"[[Sleeping Awake]]\", with a [[music video]] which focused heavily on Neo, as well as many images that were part of the film. Both songs played during the film's credits.\n\nIt was originally planned for the electronic band [[R\u00f6yksopp]] to create the soundtrack, but this offer was turned down.<ref>\"[http://www.fib.no/en/News-2015/Kafka-feat-Royksopp-at-the-Bergen-International-Festival/ Kafka feat.
