King [[Mindaugas]] was the first pan-Lithuanian ruler, as the Catholic [[King of Lithuania]] in 1253. The expansion of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] reached its height in the middle of the 14th century under the [[Grand Duke]] [[Gediminas]] (reigned 1316\u20131341), who established a strong central government which later came to dominate the territories from the Baltic Sea to the [[Black Sea]]. Grand Duke Gediminas issued letters to the [[Hanseatic league]], offering free access to his domains for men of every order and profession from nobles and [[knights]] to tillers of the soil. Economic immigrants and immigrants, seeking religious freedom improved the level of handicrafts. During the reign of Duke [[K\u0119stutis]] (1297\u20131382), the first cash taxes were introduced, although most taxes were still paid in goods (e.g., wheat, cattle, horses).\n\nIn 1569 the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] formed through the union of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The economy of the Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the exploitation of the agricultural workforce (serfs). Poland-Lithuania played a significant role in supplying 16th-century Western Europe with exports of three sorts of goods: grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and fur. These three articles amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland and maritime trade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} There was even a Lithuanian trading vessel \u2013 [[vytin\u0117]], used for four hundred years to transport grain via Nemunas river. [[Statutes of Lithuania]] were the main collections of law statements and rules in Lithuania.\n \nThe Commonwealth was famous for Europe's first and the world's second modern codified national constitution, the so-called [[Constitution of 3 May]], declared on 3 May 1791 (after the 1788 ratification of the [[United States Constitution]]). Economic and commercial reforms, previously shunned as unimportant by the [[Szlachta]], were introduced, and the development of industries was encouraged.{{by whom|date=January 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the [[Russian Empire]] controlled the majority of Lithuania. During the administration of the Lithuanian lands by the Russian Empire from 1772 to 1917, one of the most important events that affected economic relations was the [[emancipation reform of 1861]] in Russia. The reform amounted to the liquidation of serf dependence previously suffered by peasants; it boosted the development of [[capitalism]].\n\n===Lithuania in the 20th century===\n\n[[File:The Bank of Lithuania building in Kaunas, 1933 -1939.jpg|thumb|left|310px|The [[Bank of Lithuania]] building in [[Kaunas]], 1933\u20131939]]\n\nOn 16 February 1918, the [[Council of Lithuania]] passed a resolution for the re-establishment of the Independent State of Lithuania. Soon, many economic reforms for sustainable economic growth were implemented. A national currency, called the [[Lithuanian litas]], was introduced in 1922.

King [[Mindaugas]] was the first pan-Lithuanian ruler, as the Catholic [[King of Lithuania]] in 1253. The expansion of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] reached its height in the middle of the 14th century under the [[Grand Duke]] [[Gediminas]] (reigned 1316\u20131341), who established a strong central government which later came to dominate the territories from the Baltic Sea to the [[Black Sea]]. Grand Duke Gediminas issued letters to the [[Hanseatic league]], offering free access to his domains for men of every order and profession from nobles and [[knights]] to tillers of the soil. Economic immigrants and immigrants, seeking religious freedom improved the level of handicrafts. During the reign of Duke [[K\u0119stutis]] (1297\u20131382), the first cash taxes were introduced, although most taxes were still paid in goods (e.g., wheat, cattle, horses).\n\nIn 1569 the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] formed through the union of the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The economy of the Commonwealth was dominated by feudal agriculture based on the exploitation of the agricultural workforce (serfs). Poland-Lithuania played a significant role in supplying 16th-century Western Europe with exports of three sorts of goods: grain (rye), cattle (oxen) and fur. These three articles amounted to nearly 90% of the country's exports to western markets by overland and maritime trade.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} There was even a Lithuanian trading vessel \u2013 [[vytin\u0117]], used for four hundred years to transport grain via Nemunas river. [[Statutes of Lithuania]] were the main collections of law statements and rules in Lithuania.\n \nThe Commonwealth was famous for Europe's first and the world's second modern codified national constitution, the so-called [[Constitution of 3 May]], declared on 3 May 1791 (after the 1788 ratification of the [[United States Constitution]]). Economic and commercial reforms, previously shunned as unimportant by the [[Szlachta]], were introduced, and the development of industries was encouraged.{{by whom|date=January 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1772, 1793 and 1795, the [[Russian Empire]] controlled the majority of Lithuania. During the administration of the Lithuanian lands by the Russian Empire from 1772 to 1917, one of the most important events that affected economic relations was the [[emancipation reform of 1861]] in Russia. The reform amounted to the liquidation of serf dependence previously suffered by peasants; it boosted the development of [[capitalism]].\n\n===Lithuania in the 20th century===\n\n[[File:The Bank of Lithuania building in Kaunas, 1933 -1939.jpg|thumb|left|310px|The [[Bank of Lithuania]] building in [[Kaunas]], 1933\u20131939]]\n\nOn 16 February 1918, the [[Council of Lithuania]] passed a resolution for the re-establishment of the Independent State of Lithuania.

A '''Debye sphere''' is a volume whose radius is the Debye length. With each Debye length, charges are increasingly [[Electric-field screening|electrically screened]]. Every Debye\u2010length <math>\\lambda_{\\rm D}</math>, the electric potential will decrease in magnitude by 1/e. Debye length is an important parameter in [[plasma physics]], [[electrolytes]], and [[colloids]] ([[DLVO theory]]). The corresponding Debye screening wave vector <math>k_{\\rm D}=1/\\lambda_{\\rm D}</math> for particles of density <math>n</math>, charge <math>q</math> at a temperature <math>T</math> is given by <math> k_{\\rm D}^2=4\\pi n q^2/(k_{\\rm B}T) </math> in [[Gaussian units]]. Expressions in MKS units will be given below. The analogous quantities at very low temperatures (<math>T \\to 0</math>) are known as the [[Thomas\u2013Fermi screening|Thomas\u2013Fermi length]] and the Thomas\u2013Fermi wave vector. They are of interest in describing the behaviour of electrons in metals at room temperature.\n\n== Physical origin ==\nThe Debye length arises naturally in the thermodynamic description of large systems of mobile charges. In a system of <math>N</math> different species of charges, the <math>j</math>-th species carries charge <math>q_j</math> and has [[concentration]] <math>n_j(\\mathbf{r})</math> at position <math>\\mathbf{r}</math>.  According to the so-called \"primitive model\", these charges are distributed in a continuous medium that is characterized only by its [[relative static permittivity]], <math>\\varepsilon_r</math>.\nThis distribution of charges within this medium gives rise to an [[electric potential]] <math>\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})</math> that satisfies [[Poisson's equation]]:\n\n:<math> \\varepsilon \\nabla^2 \\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\, \\sum_{j = 1}^N q_j \\, n_j(\\mathbf{r}) - \\rho_{\\rm ext}(\\mathbf{r})</math>,\n\nwhere <math>\\varepsilon \\equiv \\varepsilon_r\\varepsilon_0</math>, <math>\\varepsilon_0</math> is the [[electric constant]], and <math>\\rho_{\\rm ext}</math> is a charge density external (logically, not spatially) to the medium.\n\nThe mobile charges not only contribute in establishing <math>\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})</math> but also move in response to the associated [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], <math>- q_j \\, \\nabla \\Phi(\\mathbf{r})</math>.\nIf we further assume the system to be in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with a [[heat bath]] at [[absolute temperature]] <math>T</math>, then the concentrations of discrete charges, <math>n_j(\\mathbf{r})</math>, may be considered to be thermodynamic (ensemble) averages and the associated [[electric potential]] to be a thermodynamic [[mean field theory|mean field]].\nWith these assumptions, the concentration of the <math>j</math>-th charge species is described\nby the [[Boltzmann distribution]],\n\n:<math> n_j(\\mathbf{r}) = n_j^0 \\, \\exp\\left( - \\frac{q_j \\, \\Phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_{\\rm B} T} \\right)</math>,\n\nwhere <math>k_{\\rm B}</math> is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and where <math>n_j^0</math> is the mean\nconcentration of charges of species <math>j</math>.\n\nIdentifying the instantaneous concentrations and potential in the Poisson equation with their mean-field counterparts in Boltzmann's distribution yields the [[Poisson\u2013Boltzmann equation]]:\n\n:<math> \\varepsilon \\nabla^2 \\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\, \\sum_{j = 1}^N q_j n_j^0 \\, \\exp\\left(- \\frac{q_j \\, \\Phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_{\\rm B} T} \\right) - \\rho_{\\rm ext}(\\mathbf{r}) </math>.\n\nSolutions to this nonlinear equation are known for some simple systems.  Solutions for more general\nsystems may be obtained in the high-temperature (weak coupling) limit, <math>q_j \\, \\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) \\ll k_{\\rm B} T</math>, by [[Taylor expansion|Taylor expanding]] the exponential:\n\n:<math> \\exp\\left(- \\frac{q_j \\, \\Phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_{\\rm B} T} \\right) \\approx\n1 - \\frac{q_j \\, \\Phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_{\\rm B} T}</math>.\n\nThis approximation yields the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation\n:<math> \\varepsilon \\nabla^2 \\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) =\n\\left(\\sum_{j = 1}^N \\frac{n_j^0 \\, q_j^2}{ k_{\\rm B} T} \\right)\\, \\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) -\\, \\sum_{j = 1}^N n_j^0 q_j - \\rho_{\\rm ext}(\\mathbf{r})\n</math>\nwhich also is known as the [[Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel equation]]:<ref name=Kirby>{{cite book | author=Kirby BJ. | title=Micro- and Nanoscale Fluid Mechanics: Transport in Microfluidic Devices |\nurl=http://www.kirbyresearch.com/textbook}}</ref><ref name=DLi>{{cite book | author=Li D | title=Electrokinetics in Microfluidics |\nyear=2004}}</ref><ref name=Clemmow>{{cite book |title=Electrodynamics of particles and plasmas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBNNzUrTjecC&pg=PP1&dq=particles+plasmas+inauthor:Clemmow#PPA236,M1|author=PC Clemmow & JP Dougherty|isbn=978-0-201-47986-7 |year=1969 |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |location=Redwood City CA|pages=\u00a7&nbsp;7.6.7, p. 236 ff}}</ref><ref name=Robinson>{{cite book |title=Electrolyte solutions |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZVkqm-J9GkC&pg=PR3#PPA76,M1 |author=RA Robinson &RH Stokes|isbn=978-0-486-42225-1|publisher=[[Dover Publications]]|location=Mineola, NY |year=2002}}</ref><ref name=Brydges>See {{cite journal|last1=Brydges|first1=David C.|last2=Martin|first2=Ph.

A '''Debye sphere''' is a volume whose radius is the Debye length. With each Debye length, charges are increasingly [[Electric-field screening|electrically screened]]. Every Debye\u2010length <math>\\lambda_{\\rm D}</math>, the electric potential will decrease in magnitude by 1/e. Debye length is an important parameter in [[plasma physics]], [[electrolytes]], and [[colloids]] ([[DLVO theory]]). The corresponding Debye screening wave vector <math>k_{\\rm D}=1/\\lambda_{\\rm D}</math> for particles of density <math>n</math>, charge <math>q</math> at a temperature <math>T</math> is given by <math> k_{\\rm D}^2=4\\pi n q^2/k_{\\rm B}T </math> in [[Gaussian units]]. Expressions in MKS units will be given below. The analogous quantities at very low temperatures (<math>T \\to 0</math>) are known as the [[Thomas\u2013Fermi screening|Thomas\u2013Fermi length]] and the Thomas\u2013Fermi wave vector. They are of interest in describing the behaviour of electrons in metals at room temperature.\n\n== Physical origin ==\nThe Debye length arises naturally in the thermodynamic description of large systems of mobile charges. In a system of <math>N</math> different species of charges, the <math>j</math>-th species carries charge <math>q_j</math> and has [[concentration]] <math>n_j(\\mathbf{r})</math> at position <math>\\mathbf{r}</math>.  According to the so-called \"primitive model\", these charges are distributed in a continuous medium that is characterized only by its [[relative static permittivity]], <math>\\varepsilon_r</math>.\nThis distribution of charges within this medium gives rise to an [[electric potential]] <math>\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})</math> that satisfies [[Poisson's equation]]:\n\n:<math> \\varepsilon \\nabla^2 \\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\, \\sum_{j = 1}^N q_j \\, n_j(\\mathbf{r}) - \\rho_{\\rm ext}(\\mathbf{r})</math>,\n\nwhere <math>\\varepsilon \\equiv \\varepsilon_r\\varepsilon_0</math>, <math>\\varepsilon_0</math> is the [[electric constant]], and <math>\\rho_{\\rm ext}</math> is a charge density external (logically, not spatially) to the medium.\n\nThe mobile charges not only contribute in establishing <math>\\Phi(\\mathbf{r})</math> but also move in response to the associated [[Coulomb's law|Coulomb force]], <math>- q_j \\, \\nabla \\Phi(\\mathbf{r})</math>.\nIf we further assume the system to be in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with a [[heat bath]] at [[absolute temperature]] <math>T</math>, then the concentrations of discrete charges, <math>n_j(\\mathbf{r})</math>, may be considered to be thermodynamic (ensemble) averages and the associated [[electric potential]] to be a thermodynamic [[mean field theory|mean field]].\nWith these assumptions, the concentration of the <math>j</math>-th charge species is described\nby the [[Boltzmann distribution]],\n\n:<math> n_j(\\mathbf{r}) = n_j^0 \\, \\exp\\left( - \\frac{q_j \\, \\Phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_{\\rm B} T} \\right)</math>,\n\nwhere <math>k_{\\rm B}</math> is [[Boltzmann's constant]] and where <math>n_j^0</math> is the mean\nconcentration of charges of species <math>j</math>.\n\nIdentifying the instantaneous concentrations and potential in the Poisson equation with their mean-field counterparts in Boltzmann's distribution yields the [[Poisson\u2013Boltzmann equation]]:\n\n:<math> \\varepsilon \\nabla^2 \\Phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\, \\sum_{j = 1}^N q_j n_j^0 \\, \\exp\\left(- \\frac{q_j \\, \\Phi(\\mathbf{r})}{k_{\\rm B} T} \\right) - \\rho_{\\rm ext}(\\mathbf{r}) </math>.\n\nSolutions to this nonlinear equation are known for some simple systems.

Then are separated due to family and financial pressures that Aisha's mother in law had on Moiz. Aisha did not want Moiz to go overseas insisting that the family isn't in any major financial trouble. Influenced by his mom Moiz goes overseas to earn money for his family anyway leaving Aisha devastated with her daughter behind.

Notably, in the late 1950s, the head of Renault, [[Pierre Dreyfus]], had called for the Renault R4 to have an egalitarian approach, like blue jeans, \"which people can wear in any situation if you do away with the pretentions of snobbism and social conformity.\"<ref name=\"dreyfus\">{{cite web\n |title        = Renault 4\n |publisher    = MyAutoWorld\n |author       = \n |date         = \n |url          = https://myautoworld.com/renault/cars/history/history-renault-4/history-renault-4.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring the design gestation, Giurgiaro took particular inspiration from a folding lounge chair in conceiving the seats of the Type Zero; simple, easy to maintain, modular, inexpensive to manufacture. To insure its practicality, he conceived that the Panda's cargo area should accommodate no less than two 50-liter wine [[carboy|demijohn]]s, along with a full complement of passengers.<ref name=\"tribe2\">{{cite web\n |title        = History of the Fiat Panda - Part 1: The Origins\n |publisher    = Drivetribe\n |author       =\n |date         =\n |url          = https://drivetribe.com/p/history-of-the-fiat-panda-part-CQGlc3ZwRvmfbkoym7iz1w?iid=CaW4wX0HTyiRlcokMiJEOA}}</ref><ref name=\"demijohn\">{{cite web\n |title        = Fiat Panda compie 40 anni\n |publisher    = GQ\n |author       = lessandro Vai\n |date         = March 2, 2020\n |url          = https://www.gqitalia.it/tech-auto/article/fiat-panda-40-anni-storia-foto}}</ref> From its inception, the project would use [[monocoque]] construction with a nearly flat floor<ref name=\"floor\">{{cite web\n |title        = Design dell'auto: misurarci con il passato\n |publisher    = Archimagazine\n |author       = Umberto Panarella\n |date         = \n |url          = http://www.archimagazine.com/xmisu.htm}}</ref> and a sufficiently high roof to accommodate upright seating.\n\nGiugiaro and Mantovani completed the design for its August 7 deadline, discovering only then that Benedetto had left Fiat.<ref name=\"summer\">{{cite web\n |title        = That summer in which Giugiaro created the Fiat Panda, over 40 years ago\n |publisher    = gazzatta.it\n |author       = Savina Confaloni\n |date         = February 29, 2020\n |url          = https://www.gazzetta.it/motori/la-mia-auto/28-02-2020/quell-estate-cui-giugiaro-creo-fiat-panda-oltre-40-anni-fa-3601311731177.shtml}}</ref>\n\nDespite Benedetto's departure, Italdesign presented Fiat with two full-scale models, four alternative side designs, an interior buck or mockup and a comprehensive study of the Panda's competition &mdash; as well as a series of tempera renderings by Giugiaro.<ref name=\"first\"/> Under the prototyping designation ''Progetto 141,''<ref name=\"tribe1\"/> Fiat subsequently commissioned Italdesign to create production studies, a master model, provisional tooling and pre-production prototypes.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The Active model also received new darker seat fabrics of better quality and the addition of a CD player as standard. The new dark red Fiat badge replaced the blue roundel on the Panda in Summer 2007.\n\n===2009 revisions===\nThe Panda range was mildly rearranged again in 2009, with the addition of Active Eco and Dynamic Eco models. These models feature revised 1.1 and 1.2 petrol engines respectively, with better fuel economy and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Both models also qualify for \u00a330 annual road fund licence in the UK, and replace the original standard engines. Dynamic Aircon and SkyDome models were also dropped in favour of simplifying the Panda range.\n\nOn 4 July 2011, Fiat announced that the 2,000,000th Panda had rolled off of their Tychy, Poland assembly line. The milestone car was a Panda Cross finished in Rosso Sfrontato and equipped with the 75&nbsp;hp 1.3&nbsp;L Multijet four-cylinder diesel.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com}}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The new architecture is based on the [[Fiat Mini platform]]. The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda. Unlike the previous generation - which adopted a 70 PS 1.4 ''[[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]]'' inline four - it is powered by the turbocharged, 0.9 liter, two-cylinder ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine.

Due to the cylinders being both located under the [[floorpan]], the boot's volume is reduced only by 25 liters - 200 L instead of the monofuel's 225. On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

The ELD works automatically by braking the wheel(s) where the ESC sensors detect excessive wheel slip, thus making the differentials more torque to the wheels in better traction conditions; this functionality is useful on low-grip surfaces, and is activated by the driver via a console switch.<ref name=\"fiatpress 4x4\" />\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda Cross\n}}\n\n====Panda Cross====\nLaunched at the 2014 [[Geneva Motor Show]], it is the range topping, offroad-styled Panda.

Notably, in the late 1950s, the head of Renault, [[Pierre Dreyfus]], had called for the Renault R4 to have an egalitarian approach, like blue jeans, \"which people can wear in any situation if you do away with the pretentions of snobbism and social conformity.\"<ref name=\"dreyfus\">{{cite web\n |title        = Renault 4\n |publisher    = MyAutoWorld\n |author       = \n |date         = \n |url          = https://myautoworld.com/renault/cars/history/history-renault-4/history-renault-4.html}}</ref>\n\nDuring the design gestation, Giurgiaro took particular inspiration from a folding lounge chair in conceiving the seats of the Type Zero; simple, easy to maintain, modular, inexpensive to manufacture.

Just prior to the Panda's debut at the 1980 Geneva Salon de l'Auto, Giugiaro described his design intent in a 1980 interview with [[Turin]]ese newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'', published in February 1980:\n\n{{quote|1=\u00abLa Panda (...) \u00e8 come un paio di jeans, che sono poi un vestire semplice, pratico, senza fronzoli.

Rear suspension used a [[solid axle]] suspended on [[leaf spring]]s. Later versions added mechanical improvements while retaining a robust simplicity throughout its model life.\n\nLaunch models included the '''Panda 30''', powered by a [[Longitudinal engine|longitudinally-mounted]] [[Air cooling|air cooled]] 652&nbsp;cc [[Straight-twin engine|straight-two-cylinder engine]] derived from the 126,<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Quattroruote |title=Anteprima: La \"Mini\" si toglie il cilindro: Tutte le bicilindriche |trans-title=Preview: The Mini loses a cylinder: All of the bicylinders |language=it |date=September 1984 |volume=29 |issue=347 |publisher=Editoriale Domus |location=Milan, Italy |first=Alessandro |last=Ferrari |pages=70\u201371}}</ref> and the '''Panda 45''', with a [[Transverse engine|transversely-mounted]] [[Water cooling|water cooled]] 903&nbsp;cc ([[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100 series]]) [[Inline-four engine|four-cylinder]] from the 127. As a consequence of the different drivetrain layout the 45 had the radiator grille to the right side, the 30 to the left. In September 1982 Fiat added another engine to the line-up: the '''Panda 34''' used an 843&nbsp;cc water-cooled unit, derived from that in the [[Fiat 850|850]]. It was originally reserved for export to France, Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name=TAM85>{{cite book |title=Quattroruote: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1985 |editor=Mastrostefano, Raffaele |publisher=Editoriale Domus S.p.A |ref=TAM85 |year=1985 |page=290 |language=it |location=Milano |isbn=88-7212-012-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiat Panda post facelift.jpg|thumb|left|A pre-facelift Panda Super]]\nFiat launched the '''Panda 45 Super''' at the [[Paris Motor Show]] later in 1982, with previous specification models continuing as the \"Comfort\" trim. The Super offered an optional five-speed gearbox. Minor styling changes to the Super included Fiat's revised corporate grille with five diagonal silver bars. The earlier grille design (metal with slots on the left for ventilation) continued on the Comfort models until the next major revision of the line-up. A 30 Super was added in February 1983, offering the Super trim combined with the smaller engine.\n\nThe Panda [[four-wheel drive|4x4]] was launched in June 1983, powered by a 965&nbsp;cc engine with {{convert|48|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} derived from the [[Autobianchi A112]] or [[Fiat 100 series engine]]. Known simply as the Panda 4x4, this model was the first small, transverse-engined production car to have a 4WD system.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The system itself was manually selectable, with an ultra-low first gear. Under normal (on-road) conditions starting was from second, with the fifth gear having the same ratio as fourth in the normal Panda. [[Austria]]n company [[Steyr-Puch]] supplied the entire drivetrain (clutch, gearbox, power take-off, three-piece propshaft, rear live axle including differential and brakes) to the plant at Termini Imerese where it was fitted to the reinforced bodyshell.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cohort Classic: Fiat Panda 4\u00d74 \u2013 Simply Simple|url=http://www.curbsideclassic.com/curbside-classics-european/cohort-classic-fiat-panda-4x4-simply-brilliant/|work=curbsideclassic.com|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn November 1984 trim levels were named \"L\", \"CL\", and \"S\". Specifications and detailing were modified across the range, using the Fiat corporate grille on all trims. Mechanically the range remained largely unchanged.\n\n====First facelift====\n[[File:1989 FIAT Panda.jpg|thumb|right|S post-facelift Panda]]\nIn January 1986, the Panda received visual and mechanical revisions \u2014 with many pre- and post-facelift Panda parts incompatible. The facelift version was internally designated '''141A'''.\n\nThe 652 cc air-cooled two-cylinder engine was replaced by a 769&nbsp;cc (34&nbsp;PS) water-cooled four-cylinder unit, and the 903/965cc by a 999&nbsp;cc (45&nbsp;PS, 50&nbsp;PS (37&nbsp;kW) in the 4x4) unit. Both new engines were from Fiat's new [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] family of four-cylinder water-cooled powerplants with a single overhead camshaft. The rear suspension was also upgraded, the rigid axle with leaf springs being replaced by a more modern dependent suspension system known as the \"Omega axle\", consisting of a non-straight rigid axle with a central mounting and coil springs (first seen on the [[Lancia Y10]], which used the same platform). The 4x4 retained the leaf-sprung live axle set-up.\n\nThe body was strengthened and fully galvanised on later models, virtually eliminating the earlier car's notable tendency to rust.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Rear quarter panels received wheel arches mirroring the front fender/wing wheel arches. Front door quarter windows were eliminated. The bottom seam of the facelifted model's doors retained much the earlier car's susceptibility to rust.{{cn|date=February 2020}} The range included 750L, 750CL, 750S, 1000CL, 1000S, 4x4 models.\n\n[[File:Fiat panda 2 sst.jpg|thumb|right|Fiat Panda Van]]\n[[File:1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 SISLEY (3863394372).jpg|thumb|left|1989 Fiat Panda 4x4 Sisley]]\n\nApril 1986 saw the introduction of a 1301&nbsp;cc diesel engine with 37&nbsp;bhp (a detuned 127/Uno unit). Fitted as standard with a five-speed gearbox it was only available in the basic \"L\" trim and was available until 1989 (until 1994 in the van versions).\n\nA van variant of the Panda was introduced, with both petrol and diesel engines. The van elimated rear seats and featured rear windows replaced with plastic blanking panels and a small, black, steel extension with side hinged doors \u2014in lieu of a hatch tailgate. Neither the van nor the diesel were available in right hand drive markets.\n\nIn 1987, an entry-level model badged \"Panda Young\" was added to the range. This was essentially an L spec car with a 769&nbsp;cc OHV engine based on the old 903 cc push-rod [[Fiat 100 series engine|FIAT 100]] engine and producing the same 34&nbsp;bhp (25&nbsp;kW) as the more sophisticated 769&nbsp;cc FIRE unit. The Panda 4x4 Sisley limited edition was also released, based on the standard 4x4, with metallic paint, inclinometer, white painted wheels, roof rack, headlamp washers, bonnet scoop, \"Sisley\" badging and trim. Although originally limited to the production of only 500, in 1989 the Sisley model became a permanent model.\n\n====Panda Elettra====\n[[File:Fiat Panda Elettra 1990.JPG|thumb|left|Panda Elettra in Santiago de Chile, 2010]]\nThe two-seat Panda Elettra, introduced in 1990, added an all-electric power-train to the line. Batteries replaced the rear seats and occupied some of the engine bay where the {{convert|19|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} DC motor was also fitted, driving through the normal clutch and gearbox \u2014 with weight increased to {{convert|1150|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|450|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} over than the standard model, necessitating stiffer suspension and uprated brakes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Toen al groen: Fiat Panda Elettra|url=http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|publisher=FIATblog.nl|accessdate=24 April 2011|language=nl|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310171825/http://www.fiatblog.nl/?p=4139|archivedate=10 March 2012}}</ref> 1992 revisions to the Elettra saw the power increased to {{convert|23.8|bhp|abbr=on}}<ref name=elettra /> and the weight reduced, though the Elettra remained significantly heavier than the standard Panda.\nThis, and the steep price (25.600.000 [[Italian lira|lire]] in Italy, three times the price of the Panda 750 Young) made it a commercial failure. The Elettra was discontinued in 1998.\n\n====Second facelift====\n[[File:1997 Fiat Panda.JPG|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n[[File:Fiat Panda rear 20071205.jpg|thumb|right|Second facelift of the original Panda]]\n1991, revisions included a front grille with a smaller five-bar corporate badge, as well as revisions to trim and specifications across the range. New arrivals included the 'Selecta', which had a [[continuously variable transmission]] with an electromagnetic clutch. This transmission was available either with the normal 999&nbsp;cc FIRE engine (revised with single-point fuel injection and a [[catalytic converter]]) or an all new 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit, fitted with electronic fuel injection and a three-way catalytic converter and producing {{convert|51|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe new CLX trim also featured a five-speed gearbox as standard. The range now comprised the 750 Young (769&nbsp;cc ohv), 750 and 750 CLX (both 769&nbsp;cc FIRE sohc), 900 Dance (903&nbsp;cc ohv), 1000 Shopping, CLX, CL Selecta and S (all with 999&nbsp;cc sohc, available with or without SPI and catalytic converter depending on the market), 1100 CL Selecta (1108&nbsp;cc sohc with SPI and cat) and the 4x4 Trekking (999&nbsp;cc, again available with and without a cat depending on the market). The Elettra concluded the range.\n\nIn 1992, the 1108&nbsp;cc engine, complete with SPI and catalytic converter, replaced the 999&nbsp;cc unit in the 4x4 (with 50&nbsp;bhp) and also in 1992 an 899&nbsp;cc (with injection and catalyst) became available, in the 'Cafe' special edition. This was a reduced capacity 903&nbsp;cc unit, designed to meet tax requirements in some markets. Non-catalyzed versions were withdrawn about this time.\n\nIn January 2001, the range underwent its final light adjustment. The 4x4 Trekking continued to be available, while front-wheel-drive versions were down to the Young and the Hobby. The 899&nbsp;cc was discontinued and only the Euro&nbsp;3 capable, fuel injected 1108&nbsp;cc FIRE unit remained available. These Pandas featured a body-coloured flap for the gas tank, rather than the exposed black plastic cap of earlier models.\n\n====End of production====\nThe Panda was discontinued in the UK in 1995.<ref>https://www.exchangeandmart.co.uk/reviews/fiat/panda/2004/209626</ref> The car remained in production in Italy until May 2003. Its total production run of 23 years makes the Fiat Panda one of Europe's longest-lived small cars.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===SEAT Panda / Marbella===\n[[File:Fiat Panda 1st series pink vl.jpg|thumb|right|SEAT Marbella]]\n[[File:SEATTransfront.jpg|thumb|left|SEAT Trans]]\n{{main|SEAT Marbella}}\nSpanish car maker [[SEAT]] also produced a version of the Panda between 1980 and 1986, based on the first Panda model. It was called '''SEAT Panda'''. SEAT also made a tiny, tall delivery version of the Panda called the SEAT Trans.\n\nUp to 1983, SEAT made rebadged versions of Fiat cars through a [[licence]] agreement between the two firms. Thus, there existed a Spanish version of the Panda. When [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Spain in 1982, he rode in a specially built SEAT Panda.\n\nAfter Fiat sold their share in SEAT and the licence agreement ended, the whole Fiat-based line of SEAT cars were quickly given minor facelifts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The SEAT Panda had its bonnet, bumpers and rear tailgate redesigned. From 1986, when it received a second facelift, it was known as the SEAT Marbella until the end of production in 1998. Emelba also produced a roofless version called the Pandita, which was popular as a rental car in resort areas. The SEAT Trans also received a major facelift and was renamed SEAT Terra.\n\nAs Fiat and SEAT's licensing agreement had expired in 1986 the Marbella never received the major mechanical upgrades of the facelifted Fiat Panda, instead continuing with the old [[pushrod]] Fiat-based engines, quarter light doors, un-galvanised frame and leaf-sprung suspension as for the original model. It was popular in Spain throughout its production life, but was less popular on export markets (where the Fiat version was firm favourite) and by 1996, exports had mostly finished.\n\n===Reception and awards===\nThe first generation Panda met with great success across Europe, polling 2nd in the 1981 [[European Car of the Year]] awards in its first full year of production<ref name=\"caroftheyear.org\">{{cite web | url = http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | title = Previous Cars | accessdate = 29 January 2012 | work = caroftheyear.org | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120101121344/http://www.caroftheyear.org/previous-winners/1981_1/coty | archivedate = 1 January 2012 | df = dmy-all}}</ref> (pipped to first place by the [[Escort xr3i|Ford Escort Mark III]]) and remaining on sale in some regions until May 2003.<ref name=\"panda-marbella.webs.com\">{{cite web|url=http://panda-marbella.webs.com/|title=Fiat Panda|accessdate=24 April 2011|work=panda-marbella.webs.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429011137/http://www.panda-marbella.webs.com/|archivedate=29 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981 Giugiaro received the Italian [[Compasso d'Oro]] [[Associazione per il Disegno Industriale|ADI]] [[industrial design]] [[award]] for the Panda.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,13/articleid,1054_01_1981_0221_0013_18646326/anews,true/ |title=Compasso d'oro alla Fiat Panda |date=13 September 1981 |page=13 |newspaper=[[La Stampa]] |language=it |accessdate=6 February 2015}}</ref>\nA less positive reaction to the design came from German magazine [[Der Spiegel]], which in 1980 contrasted Giugiaro defining the Panda as \"the most enchanting work of his life\", and chief designer Felice Cornacchia describing himself as \"proud overall of the car's architecture\" to Peter Glodschey, road tester of mass-market [[Bild]] newspaper, who likened the car to \"a shoe box\".<ref name=\"Spiege071980\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14325284.html|title=Legitimer Erbe: Mit einem neuen Kleinwagen will Italiens gebeutelter Auto-Riese Fiat auf dem deutschen Markt vergraulte Kunden zur\u00fcckgewinnen |quote=Stylist Giorgio Giugiaro: \"F\u00fcr mich war dies die reizvollste Arbeit meines Lebens.\" Chefkonstrukteur Felice Cornacchia: \"Am meisten bin ich stolz auf die Architektur des Wagens.\" Mit einem \"Schuhkarton\" verglich \"Bild\"-Autotester Peter Glodschey den neuen Panda.

Like the smaller [[Fiat Seicento]], the Panda was manufactured only in [[Tychy]], Poland, by [[Fiat Auto Poland]].\n\nThe high-bodied Panda takes styling cues from [[mini MPV]]s and [[mini SUV]]s, especially the second generation [[Fiat Multipla]]. The Panda won the [[European Car of the Year]] award in 2004.\n\nThe Panda includes an option for split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with [[anti-lock braking system|ABS]], [[electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]] and at least one front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted gearstick.\n\nFinancially troubled Fiat needed the new Panda to be a success, and it sold half a million units by October 2005. It sells particularly well in Italy (over half of the cars produced are sold in Italy), being seen as closer to a spiritual successor to the [[Fiat 500]] than a replacement for either the Seicento or the old Panda.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n* The 500,000th new Panda was built on 5 October 2005, a light blue Panda Emotion with the 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].\n* The 1,000,000th new Panda was built on 5 September 2007, a red Panda 4x4 Climbing with 1.2-litre petrol engine.<ref name=\"italiaspeed.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2007/cars/fiat/09/panda_1_million/0509.html|date=5 September 2007 |title=One millionth Fiat Panda rolls off the production lines |accessdate=8 September 2007|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 1,500,000th new Panda was built on 21 July 2009, a blue Panda Emotion with 1.3-litre [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"www.fiat.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2009/cars/fiat/07/panda_15_million/2407.html|date=24 July 2009 |title=Fiat Panda number 1,500,000 rolls off the lines at Tychy|accessdate=28 July 2009|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n* The 2,000,000th new Panda rolled out of factory on 4 July 2011, a red Panda 4x4 Cross with 1.3-litre 75&nbsp;bhp Multijet [[diesel engine]].<ref name=\"2-millionth-nuova-Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://italiaspeed.com/2011/cars/fiat/07/panda_2_million/0407.html|date=5 July 2011|title=Two millionth second generation Fiat Panda is built at Tychy|accessdate=5 July 2011|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]] Motoring Survey in 2006 ranked the Panda 8th out of 152 cars surveyed for reliability, craftsmanship, ownership costs, driving experience and service received.

The engine range comprised the 1.2 Fire petrol, 1.2 Fire EasyPower (petrol and LPG), 1.4 Fire Natural Power (petrol and CNG) and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The 4x4 was offered with 1.2 petrol and 1.3 Multijet diesel. The Panda Cross was no longer manufactured. The Panda Classic was produced through 2012.\n\n===Models===\n* The '''Natural Power''' is a dual-fuel version, it can burn either gasoline or CNG (Compressed Natural Gas a.k.a. methane). Methane results in low emissions and increased fuel economy. The chassis is the same of the 4x4, the space of the rear wheels differential is occupied by two methane tanks allowing over 240&nbsp;km of autonomy on gas only.\n* The basic '''Actual''' has black bumpers, lacks electric windows and a full-size spare wheel. The Actual was introduced in January 2004.\n* The '''Active''', introduced in May 2003, features black self-coloured bumpers and front electric windows, central door locking, [[Vehicle audio|radio/cassette player]], driver's airbag, power steering. Manual climate control is available as an option. Since September 2005, ABS and the front passenger's airbag have been made standard. This model has the 1100&nbsp;cc \"FIRE\" engine and a five-speed gearbox.\n* The '''Active Plus''' edition is an up-equipped ''Active'', with a [[Cassette player|cassette]]/[[CD player]] as standard. Production of the Active Plus stopped in December 2003.\n* The '''Dynamic''' edition features [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]], dual airbags, roof bars, power steering and a [[cassette player]] as standard. A CD & MP3 player, [[CD changer]], alloy wheels, manual or automated [[climate control]], glass sunroof and a semi-automatic transmission are available as options. Since September 2005, four [[airbag]]s have been standard in some countries, with an option for two additional [[Airbags#Side tubular or curtain airbag|side curtain airbags]].\n* The '''Emotion (Eleganza)''' edition is the highest trim level. This particular trim level features significant enhancements over the Dynamic, with a standard CD player, alloy wheels with low profile tires and automated [[climate control]]. In some countries such as the UK, the Emotion is sold as the \"Eleganza\".\n\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2009 Fiat Panda 100HP 1.4 Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda 100HP\n}}\n* The '''100&nbsp;HP''' edition is the sportiest Panda model. It has the 1.4-litre 16-valve [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] petrol engine from the [[Fiat Punto]] tuned to develop {{convert|100|PS|kW bhp|abbr=on}} through a six-speed manual transmission. It differs from other Pandas by being equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes, tinted windows, and sports styled front and rear bumpers. The Panda 100&nbsp;HP features a unique suspension setup with modified springs, dampers, bushes and compliance giving a considerably firmer ride.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp offers 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h acceleration in 9.5&nbsp;s and a maximum speed of {{convert|185|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with fuel consumption at {{convert|6.5|L/100 km|1|abbr=on}} in the EU combined cycle and 154&nbsp;g/km of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It was available in black, white, red, metallic blue, and metallic gray while a \"Pandamonium Pack\" which added red disc brakes, decals and colour-coded wing mirrors was an optional extra.\n\nThe Panda 100&nbsp;hp was introduced in 2006, but due to tightening emissions regulations, Fiat halted its production in July 2010.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n* The '''4x4 Climbing''' edition, introduced in December 2004, has a higher ride height and larger wheels and tires than other editions. The [[four-wheel drive]] system also makes this edition slower than others. Features are similar to those found in the Dynamic. The Climbing, however, lacks a differential lock and transmission with reductor. The Climbing edition can be distinguished by a slightly higher suspension, additional black plastic overlays on the bumpers and a \"Climbing\" badge just below the \"Panda\" badge on the left side of the rear licence plate. Swedish magazine Vi Bil\u00e4gare found in a test 2007 that Panda 4x4 is a good and economical choice for a small family who need a car with four-wheel drive.\n* The '''Cross''' edition, similar to the Climbing, features differently shaped front and rear lights and additional side cladding. Unlike the Climbing, the Cross does have a differential lock. The Cross edition became available in January 2006 in [[Italy]] and was also available in other markets including right-hand drive.\n\nThe Actual and Active are also bases for the '''Actual Van''' and '''Active Van''', which can be used as small vans (they also have an additional safety net behind the front seats and removable rear seats). These versions can be identified by small \"Van\" label on the back door.\n\nDuring the time, many limited editions of Panda (Active and Dynamic editions only) were produced. Each of them had additional interior fittings, differentiating them from the base model.\n\n===Prototypes and special editions===\n* The '''360 Special Series''', based on the 1.2 L Dynamic, is distinguished by a black and white crosshair style logo on the B pillar. Other upgraded features include; 14&nbsp;inch alloy wheels, metallic paint, special interior trim (including the Fiat brand on the front seats), built in bluetooth phone system, CD player, air conditioning and a split folding rear seat. Other more standard features include; electric windows, central locking system and dual speed power steering. The total of all these extras comes somewhere in the region of \u00a31,600 but surprisingly the upgraded 360 model actually retails at roughly \u00a3400 less than the Dynamic model. On the safety side of things, it comes with anti lock brakes and brake assist as well as two airbags as standard (driver and passenger) with the option of adding an extra four airbags taking the total up to six.\n* '''Fiat Panda Alessi'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda II Alessi 001.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Alessi]]\nItalian Design house [[Alessi (Italian company)|Alessi]] created a special edition featuring a two-tone paint scheme and unique trim inside and out. Fiat gave away some of Alessi's products (coffee machine and tin-can openers) for the special model's debut at the Ideal Home Show in the UK. The rims feature the ''Girotondo'' family accents.\n* '''Fiat Panda Jolly'''\nThe Fiat Panda Jolly was created by Fiat Styling Center and Stola and inspired by boat design. It served as a special shuttle bus in Capri during the summer of 2006. The interior features innovative materials and exclusive trims. The concept mainly came from the 600 Multipla Jolly, a car created by Carrozzeria Ghia in 1956, which could be found on the streets of Capri 50 years ago. Defined by Fiat as \"a car with a fresh, light and Mediterranean look both in the colors and materials\", the Panda Jolly is inspired by the interior design and yacht design worlds, and features styling elements that remind of the spirit and way of life of the 1960s.\n\nThe interiors are created by Paola Lenti, an Italian leading company in the Interior Design sector, specialized in the research and development of innovative fabrics and materials. All the seats are upholstered in the exclusive sailing-inspired Rope fabric. This material is nonallergic, nontoxic, antibacterial and resistant to UV rays. Many structural elements like the floor, sills and various trims are made with pickled natural ash finish with white ash inlays.\n* '''Fiat Panda Terramare 4'''\nPanda Terramare's creator is Milan born Maurizio Zanisi, an independent former [[Iso Rivolta]] engineer, and his self-built amphibian is based on a Panda 4x4 chassis, but with an inflatable flotation belt, and waterjet propulsion driven off the rear axle.\n\nOn 21 July 2006, the Terramare crossed the [[English Channel]] from [[Folkestone]] in Kent to [[Cap Gris Nez]] in just over 6 hours.<ref name=terramare>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2006/07/21/fiat-panda-marine-edition/ |title=Fiat Panda Terramare 4 makes it across the English Channel |accessdate=15 February 2009 |work=autoblog.com}}</ref>\n* '''Fiat Panda Luxury'''\nAt the 'Luxury & Yachts' show in February 2006, Fiat exhibited a one-off car based on the 4x4 called the 'Luxury'. The outside of the car features dipped silver paintwork, precious metal trim and gleaming jewel-like mouldings with back-lit inset crystals. The interior features dipped silver appointments, precious metal details, Jewel Alcantara upholstery and leather with mother of pearl finish. The Fiat logo is also worked on the seats with stylish studs and crystals.\n* '''Fiat Panda Hydrogen'''\n[[File:FiatPandaHydrogen1.jpg|thumb|Fiat Panda Hydrogen]]\n{{main|Fiat Panda Hydrogen}}\n\nThe Panda Hydrogen, a prototype driven by a hydrogen Fuel Cell, was a joint venture between Fiat Auto, the Fiat Research Centre and Fiat Powertrain Research & Technology with the support of the Research and Environment Ministries.\n\nOn the Panda Hydrogen, the Fuel Cell System is housed beneath the floorpan. The fuel cells are made up of several cells connected in series. Inside, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules are forced to react with the aid of a catalyst to produce water and heat. Electrical energy is generated with very high efficiency and zero emissions from the vehicle itself.\n\nAt full power, the Fuel Cell engine on the Panda Hydrogen delivers {{convert|60|kW|PS hp|0|abbr=on}} that allows the car to reach a top speed of more than {{convert|130|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}, with acceleration from 0 to {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} in 5 seconds. The car can also easily climb a gradient of 23% at take-off.\n\nDuring 2006 a demonstration stage of small Panda Hydrogen fleets, was a forerunner to other demonstration programs promoted and supported by the European Union and by the Italian Ministries and Regions. The aim is for such vehicles to be marketed within 15 to 20 years.\n* '''Fiat Panda Tanker'''\nUnveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in Italy, the Panda Tanker features only three doors. And although the overall shape has remained unchanged, the two rear doors have been replaced by solid panels to free up some extra load space in the practical cabin.\nRugged extras and underbody protection also help to set the Tanker apart from the standard Panda 4x4 model. Designed in conjunction with Italian [[extreme sport]] clothing manufacturer Dainese, the show star is equipped with sports seats incorporating a rigid titanium fibre shell.\n\nReflecting the matt paint finish of the exterior, the cabin has a back-to-basics feel. With no rear seats, the load floor offers flexible attachments for fixing sports kit, while an aluminium structure is designed to carry mountain bikes.\n* '''Fiat Panda MultiEco'''\nThe Panda MultiEco show-car made its world debut in Geneva 2006. Fiat sees this unit as the future of cars with a low environmental impact: the concept car represents the most advanced frontier achievable in terms of emissions and consumption, combining technologies that already exist or are ready for production.\n\nThe show-car combines an innovative 'powertrain' architecture&nbsp;\u2013 an engine with dual petrol/methane fuel supply, MTA transmission and BAS device&nbsp;\u2013 with the use of eco-compatible materials (recycled, recyclable or of natural origin) for the exterior and interior. The result is made even more interesting by the painstaking optimisation of the aerodynamics and a significant weight reduction.\n\nPanda MultiEco is equipped with a dual-fuel (methane and petrol) FIRE engine&nbsp;\u2013 future developments will also make it possible to use a methane/hydrogen mix&nbsp;\u2013 combined with a BAS (Belt-driven Alternator-Starter) device and a Dualogic robotised gearbox.\n* '''Fiat PanDAKAR'''\nTwo factory-built Fiat Panda 4x4s were prepared to contest the gruelling [[Dakar 2007]] rally raid, which started in Lisbon.\n\nEntered in the T2 category, the class which most closely represents production vehicles, the two Panda 4x4s, driven by [[Miki Biasion]] and former Dakar winner, [[Bruno Saby]], respectively, are powered by Fiat Auto's 1.3-litre Multijet turbodiesel combined with a six-speed manual gearbox. The engines deliver {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,500&nbsp;rpm and a peak torque of {{convert|123|lbft|Nm|1|abbr=on}}. at 2,500&nbsp;rpm. Apart from their small dimensions, the two cars are particularly noteworthy for their automatic all-wheel drive system with viscous coupling and locking differential, a system that provides more grip and traction on rough and soft terrain thanks to the optimal split of drive to the wheels.\n\nThe two Pandas competing in Dakar 2007 have been equipped specifically for this rally: so room has been found inside for accessories like aluminium platforms to help extricate the vehicles from soft sand, shovels, spare wheels, water reserves for the crew, and other specialised equipment useful for the occasion. The Fiat expedition to Dakar included a Fiat Sedici as service back-up, and three Iveco trucks to transport spares and technicians.\n\nBoth PanDAKAR retired on the fourth stage of the event.\n* '''Fiat Panda Simba'''\nThe Simba was unveiled at the Bologna Motor Show in 2002 as a concept car to give an idea how the following year's production Panda would look. Some of the rugged styling cues made it on the production '''Cross''' model.\n* '''Fiat Panda Aria'''\n[[File:Fiat Panda Aria 3.jpeg|thumb|Fiat Panda Aria]]\nFiat presented Aria concept in Frankfurt Motor Show 2007. The Aria is equipped with new environment-friendly technology and outputs only 69 g/km [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]]. With 900&nbsp;cc turbocharged [[Straight-twin engine|straight-2]] engine it produces {{convert|80|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, it is also capable of using both petrol and CNG.\n\nThis new engine is equipped with Fiat's Multiair technology, which uses electrohydraulic valve activation system. In monofuel (petrol) version the engine is capable of producing {{convert|105|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The car is also equipped with Stop&Start function, which helps to reduce consumption by 10% in urban driving.<ref name=\"worldcarfans.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/9070903.005/fiat-panda-aria-concept-debut|title=Fiat Panda Aria Concept Debut|accessdate=23 September 2007|work=worldcarfans.com}}</ref>\n\n===Engines===\nThe smallest engine, the 1.1&nbsp;L petrol [[SOHC]] [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine, which is rated at {{convert|54|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and found in the [[Fiat Seicento]], has been criticised{{whom|date=November 2019}} for being underpowered for the Panda, which weighs over {{convert|850|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, and the acceleration in particular was considered to be very slow. This engine is a construction from the early 1980s.\n\nThe 1.2-litre (actually 1,242&nbsp;cc), {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} engine is a derivative of the 1.1 litre, but with higher torque.\n\nThe 1.3-litre [[Multijet]] diesel engine is rated at {{convert|75|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|100|lbft|Nm|-1|abbr=on}} of torque; it is the most economical of all available engines. However, this engine is detuned from the [[Fiat Punto|Punto]] (where it develops {{convert|120|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque) due to the Panda's weaker transmission. Pandas with diesel engines can be easily distinguished by a \"Multijet\" badge on the right side of the rear licence plate.\n\nIntroduced into the range in 2006 was the 1368&nbsp;cc [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine which had previously seen service in the Fiat Stilo and the second generation Punto Sporting (contrary to some press reports, it is not an adapted version of the 1.4 16v Starjet engine used in the Grande Punto). This [[Fully Integrated Robotised Engine|FIRE]] engine has four cylinders in-line with sixteen valves actuated by belt driven double overhead camshafts.\n\nThe engine is [[undersquare]] with bore and stroke of {{convert|72|and|84|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} respectively, running at a compression ratio of 10.8:1.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:91%;\"\n|-\n!

The production began in the renewed [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco Plant|Pomigliano d'Arco Plant]] in the last quarter of 2011.\n\nThe older model stayed in production and was sold as Panda Classic, remaining popular thanks to its lower pricing (about 27%). The decision to manufacture the car in Italy, instead of manufacturing it with the cheaper workforce in Tychy, Poland, was taken because of the agreement between Italian Prime Minister [[Mario Monti]] and Fiat directors not to close down any of Fiat's plants in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finanse.wp.pl/kat,104596,title,Fiat-Panda-odjezdza-z-Polski,wid,15048426,wiadomosc.html |title=Fiat Panda odje\u017cd\u017ca z Polski! - Finanse - WP.PL |publisher=Finanse |date= |accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Models===\n\n====Panda Natural Power====\nThe Natural Power is the [[CNG]]/[[petrol]] [[bi-fuel]] version of the Panda.

On the other hand, this requires a 40&nbsp;mm taller ride height and a reworked, transversal [[Muffler|silencer]] - thus the Natural Power uses the lifted chassis of the Trekking / 4x4 versions.\n\nTotal bi-fuel capacity is 72 liters - or 12 kilograms - of CNG and 35 L of petrol - two liters less than the monofuel's 37.\nAt startup the engine runs on petrol, but switches to CNG immediately after; the car switches back to petrol automatically if it runs out of CNG or any time by driver's demand, via a dedicated button on the dashboard.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\nDue to the new tightening emissions regulations Euro 6d-Temp, after September 2018 the power output of the Natural Power ''[[Twinair engine|TwinAir]]'' engine is reduced from 80 to 70 PS, when running on CNG - although remains 85 PS, when running on petrol.\n\n====Panda EasyPower====\nThe EasyPower is the [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]/petrol bi-fuel version of the Panda; like the Natural Power it too is factory developed and manufactured.\nIts 1.2 ''FIRE'' inline four develops 69 PS.<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" />\n\n====Panda Trekking====\nLaunched in late 2012, the Trekking is a two-wheel drive model offering the looks and features of the Panda 4x4. It is distinguished from the 4x4, by the absence of skid plate inserts on bumpers, no \"4x4\" inlay in the bodyside molding and alloy wheels painted silver instead of a darker grey.\n\nAvailable on this model are the 0.9 ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol and 1.3 ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel engines, with some offroad capabilities thanks to the \"Traction +\" ESC-based electronically simulated front [[locking differential]]<ref name=\"fiatpress models\" /> and the standard [[M+S|M+S tires]], along with the ''TwinAir Natural Power'' turbocharged petrol/methane engine without the latter capabilities.\n\nThe Panda Trekking stayed in production until late 2016.\n\n[[File:' 12 - ITALY - Fiat Panda 4x4 Off-road test drive - Motorshow di Bologna cut.JPG|thumb|left|200px|A Panda 4x4 in action]]\n\n====Panda 4x4====\nThe third generation all wheel drive Panda was introduced at the 2012 [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref name=\"Panda\">{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaspeed.com/2012/cars/fiat/08/panda_4x4/2908.html|title=Panda 4x4|accessdate=3 September 2012|work=italiaspeed.com}}</ref> The engine lineup includes the ''TwinAir'' turbocharged petrol engine and ''Multijet II'' turbodiesel.

The ELD works automatically by braking the wheel(s) where the ESC sensors detect excessive wheel slip, thus making the differentials more torque to the wheels in better traction conditions; this functionality is useful on low-grip surfaces, and is activated by the driver via a console switch.<ref name=\"fiatpress 4x4\" />\n{{Multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width =\n| image1   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Front.jpg\n| image2   = 2015 Fiat Panda Cross TwinAir 900cc Rear.jpg\n| caption2 = Fiat Panda Cross\n}}\n\n====Panda Cross====\nLaunched at the 2014 [[Geneva Motor Show]], it is the range topping, offroad-styled Panda.

The [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]] (USOPC) is the [[National Olympic Committee]] for the United States.\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,522 medals (1,022 of them gold) at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 305 at the [[Winter Olympic Games]], making the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The US is ranked first in the all-time medal table even if [[All-time Olympic Games medal table#Combined total|all the incarnations of Russia and Germany are combined]], leading the second-placed Russians by 402 gold and 917 total medals. These achievements are even more impressive considering the fact that the American Olympic team remains the only in the world to receive no government funding.<ref>https://www.teamusa.org/about-the-usoc</ref>\n\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896, when [[Athens]] hosted the very first [[1896 Summer Olympics|edition]] of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-[[World War I|WW1]] period primarily due to fielding considerably less athletes than hosting countries, with the exception being the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where the US achieved its greatest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. In the [[interwar period]], America enjoyed its most successful spell, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]], when [[Berlin]] hosted the games, and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] used the event to push its political agenda. The next Olympics were held only in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] when [[World War II|WW2]] hostilities ended. By this time, Germany was no longer a competitor to the US, with its place being taken by the [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]], which went even further than the Germans and used the Olympics with a specific goal of pushing its ideological agenda. The Soviets clearly wanted to overtake the United States as a leading Olympic power and used any means they deemed necessary, including the use of professional athletes, something that was prohibited back then, and running a comprehensive state-sponsored doping program. The USSR ultimately achieved its goal, and after 20 years of fierce competition, it utterly thrashed America at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. After that, the US would not top the medal table in a non-boycotted games until the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], five years after the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|collapsed]].<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1974/07/21/archives/soviet-amateur-athlete-a-real-pro-dr-john-nelson-washburn-is-an.html</ref><ref>https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-07-22-sp-30740-story.html</ref> The 1970s and 1980s, therefore, became a dark moment for American Olympic teams, as they significantly fell behind not only the Soviet Union, but also [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], USSR's [[satellite state]]. The only bright spot was the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Games]] in [[Los Angeles]] where the United States set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics, 83, primarily due to the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Soviet-led boycott]]. In the 1990s, the situation started improving, and the US returned to the leading positions in the Summer Olympics, topping the medal table five times since 1992 and placing second on two occasions. \n\nContrary to its Summer Olympics status, America was never really considered a power in the Winter Games until the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]]. Therefore, its greatest achievements in the 20th century are more tied to specific events, rather than overall performances. However, hosting the games in 2002 gave a much needed boost to the US winter sports program, and since then the country performed consistently, never placing below fourth in the medal count, although America's performance has steadily declined since winning the most medals at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], with the US winning only 23 medals at the most recent [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Games]] in [[Pyeongchang]] compared to 37 in 2010.\n\n== Hosted Games ==\nThe United States has hosted the Games on '''eight''' occasions, more than any other nation, and is planning to host the '''ninth''':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. [[James Brendan Connolly|James Connolly]] became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump|triple jump]], and [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]] grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1896/</ref>\n\n[[File:Margaret-abbott-gold-medal-1900-golf.jpg|thumb|left|[[Margaret Abbott]] competing in golf]]\nAt the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts that fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was [[Margaret Abbott]] who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual|women's golf]]. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of [[Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics|athletics]] where US athletes clinched 16 gold and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of track, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly less athletes.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1900/</ref>\n\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\nThe [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n===Interwar period (1920\u20131936)===\n\n===Cold War era (1948\u20131992)===\n[[File:Bob Mathias 1952.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Bob Mathias]] became the star of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London games]] by winning the [[Athletics at the 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|decathlon]] event at the age of 17. He would go on to repeat this feat at the [[Athletics at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|1952 Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], setting a new world record.]]\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]] marked the first time that the newly communist countries, that were occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War Two|WW2]], competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up [[Sweden at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The [[1948 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating [[France men's national basketball team|France]] in the final, 65\u201321.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1948/</ref>\n\n[[File:USA-USSR.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gold medal game in basketball at the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] between the [[United States men's national basketball team|US]] and the [[Soviet Union men's national basketball team|USSR]]. The Americans won, 36-25.]]\nIn [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[Helsinki]] saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system\u2019s superiority.<ref>http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/</ref><ref>www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf</ref> The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were ''[[de facto]]'' professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.<ref>http://www.processhistory.org/redihan-1952-olympics/</ref> The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the [[Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Soviets]] who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. [[1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1952/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobby Morrow with wife 1956.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Bobby Morrow]] won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].]]\n[[Melbourne]] hosted the Olympics in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|invasion of Hungary]], but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called [[Blood in the Water match|Blood in the Water]]. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The [[1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1956/</ref>\n\n[[File:Giuseppina leone.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Wilma Rudolph]] became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]].]]\nThe [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 meters freestyle]], despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|men's 4x100 relay team]]. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]], however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1960/</ref>\n\n[[File:Don Schollander 1964.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Don Schollander]] won 4 golds in swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 games]] in [[Tokyo]], the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936.]]\nThere was some redemption for the US at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], as the nation returned to the top of the [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|gold medal count]] for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The [[1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73\u201359.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1964/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Beamon 1968.jpg|200px|right|thumb|There were many historic achievements at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympics]] but, perhaps, the most significant among them was [[Bob Beamon]]'s performance in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump|long jump]], where he improved the world record by 55 cm.]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico Olympics]] became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the [[1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1968/</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the ''[[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]]'' as the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week, in which eleven [[Israel]]i [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|athletes and coaches]] and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by [[Black September Organization|Black September]] terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 meters]] were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meters freestyle]] was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the [[Shooting at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle, prone|50 meters rifle]] only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and greco-roman (14\u20136 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German [[Doping in East Germany|dopers]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1972/</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2016/07/31/docs-boys-story-dominant-us-swim-team-1976/87614856/</ref> while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4x100 freestyle relay]]. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2016/06/04/40-years-later-story-of-us-east-german-olympic-swimmers-can-be-told-best-in-the-last-gold/</ref> In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.<ref>https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/15293108/1976-us-olympic-boxing-team-celebrate-40-year-reunion-boxing-hall-fame-banquet-champions</ref> In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the [[Shooting at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle three positions|mixed 50 meters rifle three positions]]; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The [[1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US men's basketball team]] reclaimed the gold medal, while the [[United States women's national basketball team|women's team]] won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31st when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1976/</ref>\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics]] marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policies.<ref>U.

Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55\u201360 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40\u201345 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30\u201335 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Summer Olympics|host country]] and [[East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics|East Germany]] in what was the most skewed medal tally since [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]].<ref>Moscow 1980 Olympic Games.

The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60\u201365 gold medals compared to 35\u201345 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|website=jimrome.com|title=Bryan Fogel talks 1984 Summer Olympics boycott on The Jim Rome Podcast|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122112500/http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]] as well because [[South Korea]] had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only [[North Korea]]. However, the policies of [[Perestroika]] that were initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. [[Cuba at the Summer Olympics|Cuba]], clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|collapse]] but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals). \n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html</ref> Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own [[National Olympic Committee]], and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n===Modern period (1994\u2013present)===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Amateurism and professionalism==\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Russia\u2013United States rivalry==\n[[Russia]] (in all its incarnations) and the [[United States]] have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/262864/all-time-summer-olympics-medals-table/|title=All-time Summer Olympics medals table 1896-2016 &#124; Statistic|website=Statista}}</ref> Russia topped the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|overall medal count]] at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics. The countries developed a strong rivalry during the [[Cold War]], and while the tensions eased in the 1990s, the relations deteriorated in [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014]] and [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election|2016]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5164194/usa-russia-olympics-hockey/|title=USA Men's Team Vs.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 tournament]] the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Basketball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and bronze in [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championship]] play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. \n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.<ref name=\"a1972\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html|title=Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the [[basketball court]] was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]].<ref name=espn1>''By Frank Saraceno''.

American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star [[Bill Walton]] declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] or [[Tommy Burleson]] (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars [[Sergei Belov]], [[Modestas Paulauskas]], and [[Alexander Belov]]. The players had played together for more than seven years. For [[Gennadi Volnov]] it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4\u20138 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted [[Dwight Jones (basketball)|Dwight Jones]], as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by [[Mikheil Korkia]] and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee [[Renato Righetto]] to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as [[FIBA]] officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{see also|Miracle on Ice}}\n[[File:USA - Soviet Union 1980 match.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|An amateur photo featuring U.S. vs USSR matchup]]\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] on the way to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2\u20132 round-robin draw and a 3\u20132 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\"/> The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], with the U.S. earning a decisive 5-3 victory.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org:443/Road-to-Sochi-2014/Features/2014/February/15/Team-USA-Beats-Russia-In-Marathon-On-Ice|title=Team USA Beats Russia In 'Marathon On Ice'|website=Team USA}}</ref> Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n==See also==\n*[[United States at the Summer Olympics]]\n*[[United States at the Winter Olympics]]\n*[[List of United States Olympic medalists]]\n*[[United States at the Paralympics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |title=United States of America |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/united-states-of-america }}\n* {{IOC medals|NOC=USA}}\n* {{cite web |title=Olympic Medal Winners |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/athletes?search=1&countryname=united%20states%20of%20america }}\n* {{cite web |title=United States |publisher=Sports-Reference.com |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA }}\n\n{{country at games navbox|United States|Olympics}}\n{{Nations at the Olympics}}\n{{National sports teams of the United States}}\n{{Sport in the United States}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:United States At The Olympics}}\n[[Category:United States at the Olympics| ]]\n[[Category:National sports teams of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox country at games\n| NOC = USA\n| NOCname = [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]]\n| games = Olympics\n| year = \n| flagcaption = [[Flag of the United States]]\n| oldcode = \n| website = \n| location = \n| competitors = \n| sports = \n| flagbearer = \n| rank = 1\n| gold = 1127\n| silver = 907\n| bronze = 793\n| officials = \n| appearances = \n| app_begin_year = \n| app_end_year = \n| summerappearances = {{Team appearances list|team=United States|competition=Summer Olympics|begin_year=|end_year= }}\n| winterappearances = {{Team appearances list|team=United States|competition=Winter Olympics|begin_year=|end_year= }}\n| seealso = [[United States at the 1906 Intercalated Games|1906]] Intercalated Games\n}}\n{{See also|United States at the Summer Olympics|United States at the Winter Olympics}}\nThe '''[[United States|United States of America]]''' (USA) has sent athletes to every celebration of the modern [[Olympic Games]] with the exception of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], during which it led a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] to protest the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. The [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]] (USOPC) is the [[National Olympic Committee]] for the United States.\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,522 medals (1,022 of them gold) at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 305 at the [[Winter Olympic Games]], making the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The US is ranked first in the all-time medal table even if [[All-time Olympic Games medal table#Combined total|all the incarnations of Russia and Germany are combined]], leading the second-placed Russians by 402 gold and 917 total medals. These achievements are even more impressive considering the fact that the American Olympic team remains the only in the world to receive no government funding.<ref>https://www.teamusa.org/about-the-usoc</ref>\n\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896, when [[Athens]] hosted the very first [[1896 Summer Olympics|edition]] of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-[[World War I|WW1]] period primarily due to fielding considerably less athletes than hosting countries, with the exception being the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where the US achieved its greatest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. In the [[interwar period]], America enjoyed its most successful spell, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]], when [[Berlin]] hosted the games, and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] used the event to push its political agenda. The next Olympics were held only in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] when [[World War II|WW2]] hostilities ended. By this time, Germany was no longer a competitor to the US, with its place being taken by the [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]], which went even further than the Germans and used the Olympics with a specific goal of pushing its ideological agenda. The Soviets clearly wanted to overtake the United States as a leading Olympic power and used any means they deemed necessary, including the use of professional athletes, something that was prohibited back then, and running a comprehensive state-sponsored doping program. The USSR ultimately achieved its goal, and after 20 years of fierce competition, it utterly thrashed America at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. After that, the US would not top the medal table in a non-boycotted games until the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], five years after the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|collapsed]]. The 1970s and 1980s, therefore, became a dark moment for American Olympic teams, as they significantly fell behind not only the Soviet Union, but also [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], USSR's [[satellite state]]. The only bright spot was the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Games]] in [[Los Angeles]] where the United States set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics, 83, primarily due to the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Soviet-led boycott]]. In the 1990s, the situation started improving, and the US returned to the leading positions in the Summer Olympics, topping the medal table five times since 1992 and placing second on two occasions. \n\nContrary to its Summer Olympics status, America was never really considered a power in the Winter Games until the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]]. Therefore, its greatest achievements in the 20th century are more tied to specific events, rather than overall performances. However, hosting the games in 2002 gave a much needed boost to the US winter sports program, and since then the country performed consistently, never placing below fourth in the medal count, although America's performance has steadily declined since winning the most medals at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]], with the US winning only 23 medals at the most recent [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Games]] in [[Pyeongchang]] compared to 37 in 2010.\n\n== Hosted Games ==\nThe United States has hosted the Games on '''eight''' occasions, more than any other nation, and is planning to host the '''ninth''':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. [[James Brendan Connolly|James Connolly]] became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump|triple jump]], and [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]] grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1896/</ref>\n\n[[File:Margaret-abbott-gold-medal-1900-golf.jpg|thumb|left|[[Margaret Abbott]] competing in golf]]\nAt the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts that fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was [[Margaret Abbott]] who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual|women's golf]]. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of [[Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics|athletics]] where US athletes clinched 16 gold and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of track, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly less athletes.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1900/</ref>\n\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\nThe [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n===Interwar period (1920\u20131936)===\n\n===Cold War era (1948\u20131992)===\n[[File:Bob Mathias 1952.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Bob Mathias]] became the star of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London games]] by winning the [[Athletics at the 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|decathlon]] event at the age of 17. He would go on to repeat this feat at the [[Athletics at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|1952 Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], setting a new world record.]]\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]] marked the first time that the newly communist countries, that were occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War Two|WW2]], competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up [[Sweden at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The [[1948 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating [[France men's national basketball team|France]] in the final, 65\u201321.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1948/</ref>\n\n[[File:USA-USSR.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gold medal game in basketball at the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] between the [[United States men's national basketball team|US]] and the [[Soviet Union men's national basketball team|USSR]]. The Americans won, 36-25.]]\nIn [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[Helsinki]] saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system\u2019s superiority.<ref>http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/</ref><ref>www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf</ref> The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were ''[[de facto]]'' professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.<ref>http://www.processhistory.org/redihan-1952-olympics/</ref> The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the [[Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Soviets]] who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. [[1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1952/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobby Morrow with wife 1956.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Bobby Morrow]] won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].]]\n[[Melbourne]] hosted the Olympics in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|invasion of Hungary]], but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called [[Blood in the Water match|Blood in the Water]]. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The [[1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1956/</ref>\n\n[[File:Giuseppina leone.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Wilma Rudolph]] became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]].]]\nThe [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 meters freestyle]], despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|men's 4x100 relay team]]. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]], however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1960/</ref>\n\n[[File:Don Schollander 1964.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Don Schollander]] won 4 golds in swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 games]] in [[Tokyo]], the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936.]]\nThere was some redemption for the US at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], as the nation returned to the top of the [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|gold medal count]] for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The [[1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73\u201359.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1964/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Beamon 1968.jpg|200px|right|thumb|There were many historic achievements at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympics]] but, perhaps, the most significant among them was [[Bob Beamon]]'s performance in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump|long jump]], where he improved the world record by 55 cm.]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico Olympics]] became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the [[1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1968/</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the ''[[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]]'' as the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week, in which eleven [[Israel]]i [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|athletes and coaches]] and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by [[Black September Organization|Black September]] terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 meters]] were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meters freestyle]] was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the [[Shooting at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle, prone|50 meters rifle]] only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and greco-roman (14\u20136 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German [[Doping in East Germany|dopers]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1972/</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2016/07/31/docs-boys-story-dominant-us-swim-team-1976/87614856/</ref> while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4x100 freestyle relay]]. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2016/06/04/40-years-later-story-of-us-east-german-olympic-swimmers-can-be-told-best-in-the-last-gold/</ref> In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.<ref>https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/15293108/1976-us-olympic-boxing-team-celebrate-40-year-reunion-boxing-hall-fame-banquet-champions</ref> In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the [[Shooting at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle three positions|mixed 50 meters rifle three positions]]; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The [[1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US men's basketball team]] reclaimed the gold medal, while the [[United States women's national basketball team|women's team]] won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31st when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1976/</ref>\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics]] marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policies.<ref>U.

Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55\u201360 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40\u201345 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30\u201335 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Summer Olympics|host country]] and [[East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics|East Germany]] in what was the most skewed medal tally since [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]].<ref>Moscow 1980 Olympic Games. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library Edition: http://www.library.ebonline.com/eb/article-9098213</ref> The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1980/</ref>\n\nIn [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], [[Los Angeles]] witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles&mdash;Romania&mdash;encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60\u201365 gold medals compared to 35\u201345 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|website=jimrome.com|title=Bryan Fogel talks 1984 Summer Olympics boycott on The Jim Rome Podcast|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122112500/http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]] as well because [[South Korea]] had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only [[North Korea]]. However, the policies of [[Perestroika]] that were initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. [[Cuba at the Summer Olympics|Cuba]], clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|collapse]] but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals). \n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html</ref> Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own [[National Olympic Committee]], and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n===Modern period (1994\u2013present)===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Amateurism and professionalism==\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Russia\u2013United States rivalry==\n[[Russia]] (in all its incarnations) and the [[United States]] have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/262864/all-time-summer-olympics-medals-table/|title=All-time Summer Olympics medals table 1896-2016 &#124; Statistic|website=Statista}}</ref> Russia topped the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|overall medal count]] at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics. The countries developed a strong rivalry during the [[Cold War]], and while the tensions eased in the 1990s, the relations deteriorated in [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|2014]] and [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election|2016]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/5164194/usa-russia-olympics-hockey/|title=USA Men's Team Vs.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 tournament]] the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Basketball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and bronze in [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championship]] play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. \n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.<ref name=\"a1972\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html|title=Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the [[basketball court]] was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]].<ref name=espn1>''By Frank Saraceno''.

American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star [[Bill Walton]] declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] or [[Tommy Burleson]] (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars [[Sergei Belov]], [[Modestas Paulauskas]], and [[Alexander Belov]]. The players had played together for more than seven years. For [[Gennadi Volnov]] it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4\u20138 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted [[Dwight Jones (basketball)|Dwight Jones]], as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by [[Mikheil Korkia]] and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee [[Renato Righetto]] to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as [[FIBA]] officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{see also|Miracle on Ice}}\n[[File:USA - Soviet Union 1980 match.jpg|thumb|upright|300px|An amateur photo featuring U.S. vs USSR matchup]]\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] on the way to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements.

It was originally clustered along a stream, named 'Hole Beck', about half a mile up the hill from the estuary below. It was also the junction of four roads passing through the area. Firstly, there was the 'Sands' road, named 'Marsh Lane' in maps of the 1850s, heading down the hill towards the shore, where it met one of the possible routes for crossing the treacherous tidal sands of the [[River Duddon|Duddon]] at low tide. Secondly, there was the lane heading north along a ridge towards [[Kirkby-in-Furness]]. Part of these two roads form today's A595 main road.

Unlike the original show, Mork is accompanied by his Orkan pet, a pink, six-legged, [[dog]]-like creature named Doing (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) which is pronounced as \"Doyng\".
