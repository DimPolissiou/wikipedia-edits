After settling in its new location, the name Gandara was given to it in commemoration of the former [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]].\n\nThe municipality of Gandara is known for its products such as queseo, rice, rootcrops and peanuts exported in the entire region of Eastern Visayas and any point of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nGandara is the home also of the well-known corpse of Maria Diana Alvarez believed to be miraculous by the Gandare\u00f1os.\n[[File:Ma._Diana\u2019s_Chapel_in_Gandara,_Samar_(Home_of_the_miraculous_corpse_of_Maria_Diana_Alvarez).jpg|thumb|Ma.

Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes). During the war, the second waorld war, Japanese occupied this town and make the Gavaldon Building their headquarter, all Chinese traders, locals and their offspring were called and enslave them, making them a peasants. Japanese tell one Filadelfo Aliman that this maltreatment is a retaliation on their long aged war the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], they Chinese (sino) to fight back processed a seasoning called \"Vetsin\" (a powder from a snailshell or \u201c''tipaka han wawang nga ginpino\u201d''  in Waray that causes the illness called [http://www.globalnetwork.org/schistosomiasis schistosomiasis] and told the Filipino public that it is from the Japanese armies even its name is a Japanese word. The Japanese leave and promise and then will constructure a steel bridge value that makes them stand and be courageous because of the Filipino hospitality.\n\nIn December 6, 1987, San Jorge were created as a new municipality respectively out of Gandara. 42 barangays were dissolved by the town of San Jorge including the Gandare\u00f1os owner of Atigbang Senibaran (Villaleona) to the new town administration.\n\n==Barangays==\n\n[[File:Barangays of Gandara.png|thumb|280px|Barangays of Gandara]]\nGandara is politically subdivided into 69 [[barangay]]s, listed here with its Philippine Standard Geographic Code.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Adela Heights ([[Poblacion]])\n* Arong\n* Balocawe\n* Bangahon\n* Beslig\n* Buao\n* Bunyagan\n* Burabod I ([[Poblacion]])\n* Burabod II ([[Poblacion]])\n* Calirocan\n* Canhumawid\n* Caparangasan\n* Caranas\n* Carmona\n* Casab-ahan\n* Casandig\n* Catorse De Agosto\n* Caugbusan\n* Concepcion\n* Diaz\n* Dumalo-ong ([[Poblacion]])\n* Elcano\n* Gerali\n* Gereganan\n* Giaboc\n* Hampton\n* Hetebac\n* Himamaloto\n* Hinayagan\n* Hinugacan\n* Hiparayan (Kinonongan)\n* Jasminez\n* Lungib\n* Mabuhay\n* Macugo\n* Malayog\n* Marcos\n* Minda ([[Poblacion]])\n* Nacube\n* Nalihugan\n* Napalisan\n* Natimonan\n* Ngoso\n* Palambrag\n* Palanas\n* Pi\u00f1aplata\n* Pizarro\n* Pologon\n* Purog\n* Rawis\n* Rizal\n* Samoyao\n* San Agustin\n* San Antonio\n* San Enrique\n* San Francisco\n* San Isidro (Dao)\n* San Jose\n* San Miguel\n* San Pelayo\n* San Ramon\n* Santa Elena\n* Santo Ni\u00f1o\n* Senibaran (Villa Leona)\n* Sidmon\n* Tagnao\n* Tambongan\n* Tawiran\n* Tigbawon\n\n==Climate==\n{{Weather box\n| location     = Gandara, Samar\n| width        = auto\n| metric first = Yes\n| single line  = Yes\n| Jan high C = 28\n| Jan low C  = 21\n| Feb high C = 29\n| Feb low C  = 21\n| Mar high C = 29\n| Mar low C  = 21\n| Apr high C = 31\n| Apr low C  = 22\n| May high C = 31\n| May low C  = 24\n| Jun high C = 30\n| Jun low C  = 24\n| Jul high C = 29\n| Jul low C  = 24\n| Aug high C = 29\n| Aug low C  = 25\n| Sep high C = 29\n| Sep low C  = 24\n| Oct high C = 29\n| Oct low C  = 24\n| Nov high C = 29\n| Nov low C  = 23\n| Dec high C = 28\n| Dec low C  = 22\n| Jan precipitation mm = 72\n| Feb precipitation mm = 52\n| Mar precipitation mm = 65\n| Apr precipitation mm = 62\n| May precipitation mm = 87\n| Jun precipitation mm = 129\n| Jul precipitation mm = 153\n| Aug precipitation mm = 124\n| Sep precipitation mm = 147\n| Oct precipitation mm = 157\n| Nov precipitation mm = 139\n| Dec precipitation mm = 117\n| Jan rain days        = 17.4\n| Feb rain days        = 13.4\n| Mar rain days        = 16.8\n| Apr rain days        = 18.0\n| May rain days        = 22.0\n| Jun rain days        = 25.3\n| Jul rain days        = 26.2\n| Aug rain days        = 24.2\n| Sep rain days        = 24.9\n| Oct rain days        = 26.0\n| Nov rain days        = 23.3\n| Dec rain days        = 20.8\n| source 1 = Meteoblue <ref name=\"met_norms\">\n{{cite web \n| url = https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/historyclimate/climatemodelled/gandara_philippines_1713262\n| title =  Gandara: Average Temperatures and Rainfall\n| publisher = Meteoblue\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020 }}</ref>\n| date = 29 February 2020 \n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census \n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Gandara\n| 1903 = 12014\n| 1918 = 14320\n| 1939 = 18507\n| 1948 = 25048\n| 1960 = 24883\n| 1970 = 28307\n| 1975 = 30600\n| 1980 = 24764\n| 1990 = 23673\n| 1995 = 27263\n| 2000 = 28866\n| 2007 = 31222\n| 2010 = 31943\n| 2015 = 34434\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote = Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] {{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nBased on latest 2014 survey, the total population was 33,264, consisting of 17,046 males and 16,218 females.

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

After settling in its new location, the name Gandara was given to it in commemoration of the former [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]].\n\nThe municipality of Gandara is known for its products such as queseo, rice, rootcrops and peanuts exported in the entire region of Eastern Visayas and any point of the Philippine archipelago.\n\nGandara is the home also of the well-known corpse of Maria Diana Alvarez believed to be miraculous by the Gandare\u00f1os.\n[[File:Ma._Diana\u2019s_Chapel_in_Gandara,_Samar_(Home_of_the_miraculous_corpse_of_Maria_Diana_Alvarez).jpg|thumb|Ma. Diana\u2019s Chapel in Gandara, Samar (Home of the miraculous corpse of Maria Diana Alvarez)]]\n\n==History==\n\nDuring the 9th century, after the Mesopotamian exploration the Hindus explored the Cambaye Island, they bring [https://web.archive.org/web/20120804005759/http://www.anagrasarkalyan.gov.in/htm/gallery_wadi.html Sabai Grass] seedlings, Negritos and the Hindus help together to grow the Grass, when the grass are ripe enough they harvest it and sundried it, Sabai fibres were extracted from Sabai Grasses, they weave the dried grass and turn it into dresses by using a [[catgut]] as a weaver.\n\nOn the 13th century an Arabian-British explorer built and structured this sea farer guide from an Scree with the help of a Negrito inhabitants located nearby with China White as an ingredient as building material, it is lit with a Western Incandescent lamp and powered by a [[Baghdad Battery|Baghdad Carbon Cell]], the said battery is charged by sun at day.\n \nGand\u00e6ra's colonial past is evident from the solitary watchtower, the Friars returned after the remaining crew of Magellan came back from Spain, and situated along the Village called Dapdap and their Shrine called Tinago in 1596, and created a Cabecera called Catbalogan, and the Bangahon Church, the [[relic]]s of the church and fragmented artworks. Statues of saints are of numbers one of which is the St. Ni\u00f1o (An infant Child) a ''White'' statue carved from wood and being tell that it is a pair of the ''Black'' statue of the St. Ni\u00f1o of Cebu the Magellan remnants they called the Black and White saints. The White statue is being told that a clan \"Correche\" is now being held it privately. Townspeople quarried the stones from [[Napalisan]] cliff or scree carried to Dapdap and then formed and constructed the [[Tinago Shrine]] and the church from what they called ''Galut'' a clay or  ''[[Feldspar]], [[Kaolinite]]'' used to make a pot or in a pottery business in Bangahon for the church of Bangahon. These are remnants from the old Gand\u00e6ra, named Bangahon due to its geographical location in the forked of the Gandara River. \"''Ginbabanga han wala ug tuo nga salog''\". The book ''Conquistas de las Islas Filipinas'' by Gaspar de San Agustin the Bangahon states it was already a [[Pueblo]] or town in 1729, and was made a parish by the Spanish [[Jesuits]] [[Missionaries]] with [[St. Michael the Archangel]] as [[patron saint]].\n\nThe Eighteenth Century ended with Bangahon at the height of abundance and prosperity being a trading center complemented with its fertile soil producing plentiful and ample harvest every year. Potable water were carried from a balangay with a Natural Spring of Mineral Water now called San Agustin.  However, when the American battleships landed at Calbayog on February 9, 1902, the municipal officials of Bangahon prepared an occasion for the American soldiers. The American Scout then told the officials of this Marlboro that they will be donating a Bell and will constructed a school called Harvard Institute. The problem of where to build this landmark to become a new town was solved during a conference of July 25, 1903, at barrio San Pelayo but [[Dumalo-ong]] was unanimously chosen due to its ideal location being at the center and midway of the left river, right river and downstreams barrios. The bell or (Lingganay) a misfortune were carried by a barge and accidentally sunked{{typo help inline|reason=similar to sundek|date=November 2019}} and collide to it near an adobe rock formation before Bangahon going upstream along with the Bell. This bell was sequestered by the Americans on September 29, 1901 at [[Balangiga bells|Balangiga]]. Furthermore, the chosen site was located almost halfway between Calbayog City and Catbalogan City an ambient place for a Harvard Institute. Gand\u00e6ra's foundation anniversary is February the 29th.\n\nEstablished in February 29, 1904 and named after the surname of [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Spanish Governor General]] [[Jos\u00e9 de la G\u00e1ndara y Navarro]] as a respect by the American Soldier, the first captain was Jose Dionesio Mendiola, who died during the year's [[cholera]] epidemic and replaced by Jose Pichon on June 15, 1902, the contact of the American Scout not knowing were will be the bell will come from, nodding as his used attitude, served until June 15, 1903. Succeeded by Ramon Mendiola (1903\u20131906) who was remembered for celebrating the first Gand\u00e6ra town fiesta on September 28\u201329, 1904. From the year 1907, town executives were called Presidents. And the Reyes Clan as Royalty.\n\nThe town's new [[poblacion]] was built on some six hectares of farmland donated by Martino M. Reyes. The donation was executed on January 12, 1909. The school site covered by certificate of title no. 95 dated July 20, 1912, and that of the parish under lot no. 146-CAD-444-D dated August 31, 1914, further supported by an extra judicial donation dated March 20, 1915.\n\nArticle 960 dated October 23, 1923, transferred the jurisdiction of bara\u014bgays Bangon, Buenas Aires, Calanyugan, Cambaye, San Luis, Pangi and Pagsanghan to the Municipality of [[Tarangnan, Samar|Tarangnan]].\n\nDuring World War II, there are two Mayors in this municipality, Filadelfo Diaz Aliman for the Japanese Government and Teodoro Bisnar for the Philippine Government the [[Pulahanes]] (Pulajanes).

They produce and consume by exchanging products to and from farm or towncenter, until a townfolk ''kadiong'' convinced them to put up a cooperative or a cooperation of Gandare\u00f1os\u2019 products to put up a bunk or a stockade and that cooperative will issue a bunknote to ease the trading of products or goods. Fellows can lend seeds or fishlings from the stockade, lenders now start with their own products and can be trade with the bunk/stockade or cooperative bunknotes. Bunknotes became rampant on the town and they decided to issue a paper and metal money as a bunknote. Products from different villages stocked at the bunk, and every village has a unique bunknote to signify their origins, aside from Bangahon were a calamity had happened they only had a few stocks but in their village that stock equivalent of a bunknote has a higher value, the village with the highest stocks is the reference stocks, their number of products divided by the reference stocks is the particular village bunknote equivalent in trading. Excess stocks in the bunk are used for the development of the town.\n\nThe cooperative is until now in service but has a different name, a bank and being run by lists of corporate stores within the town.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Allotment from the National Government Budget Management Office for Gandara was PHP 28,202,218 as of 2006.\n\n==Administrative Boundaries==\n\n===Aquatic Boundaries===\n*East 11.9935 North 124.6694 merge point of Santa Margarita, Calbayog, Tarangnan and Gandara, 10,241 meters West-Northwest of Napalisan (E 11.9895 / N 124.7305)\n*East 12.0049 / North 124.7597 between Santa Margarita and Gandera a river called Lambique-Hinagbungan River 5,521 meters Northeast of Napalisan, this river serves as a boundary between two municipalities, down to East 11.99120 / North 124.75106 of the said river 1,315 meters North of Tambongan.\n*East 11.9397 / North 124.7116 merge point of Tarangnan, Pagsanghan and Gandara, 8,909 meters South-Southwest of Napalisan (E11.9895/S\\N124.7305)\n*East 11.9723 / North 124.7532 between Pagsanghan and Gandara between an islet and an island called Cambaye and Caprangasan respectively 4,763 meters Southeast of Napalisan a river called Pagsanghan-Gandara River then to East 11.9601 / North 124.7136 midpoint of a river 881 meters East-Southeast of Lungib and 319 meters Northeast of Bangon Island a river boundary then to East 11.9710 / North 124.7265, 50 meters north of Palanas midpoint of Pagsanghan-Gandara River to the right where left is back to Caprangasan.

At its [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]] population of 193,832, it is [[List of towns in Ontario|Ontario's largest town]]. Oakville is part of the [[Greater Toronto Area]], one of the most densely populated areas of Canada.\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1793, [[Dundas Street (Toronto)|Dundas Street]] was surveyed for a military road. In 1805, the [[Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada]] bought the lands between [[Etobicoke]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] from the indigenous [[Mississaugas]] people, except for the land at the mouths of [[Bronte Creek|Twelve Mile Creek (Bronte Creek)]], [[Sixteen Mile Creek (Ontario)|Sixteen Mile Creek]], and along the [[Credit River]]. In 1807, British immigrants settled the area surrounding Dundas Street as well as on the shore of [[Lake Ontario]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barclaysquare.ca/about-us/history/|title=History of Oakville|publisher=barclaysquare.ca|accessdate=August 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1820, the Crown bought the area surrounding the waterways. The area around the creeks, {{convert|960|acres|km2}}, ceded to the Crown by the Mississaugas,<ref>{{cite web| title=Illustrated Historical Atlas of Halton County (1877)| publisher=Waler & Miles|url=http://www.halinet.on.ca/localhistory/Page.asp?PageID=169| accessdate=2008-05-26}}</ref> was auctioned off to [[William Chisholm (Upper Canada)|William Chisholm]] in 1827. He left the development of the area to his son, [[Robert Kerr Chisholm]], and his brother-in-law, Merrick Thomas. Chisholm also formed shipbuilding business in Oakville Navy Street and [[Sixteen Mile Creek (Halton Region)]] and lasted until 1842, but shipbuilding in Oakville lasted into the late 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakville.ca/culturerec/harbourheritage-essay3.html|title=Oakville Harbour Heritage|publisher=oakville.ca|accessdate=August 14, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cncphotoalbum.com/archive/cnchistory/history.htm|title=Oakville CN History|publisher=cncphotoalbum.com|accessdate=August 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe population in 1846 was 1,500. The community shipped large quantities of wheat and lumber via schooners and the railway. There were three churches, a grist mill and saw mill, and various small companies making threshing machines, wagons, watches, saddles, and metal goods. There were also tradesmen of various types.<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

In the 1850s, there was an economic recession and the foundry, the most important industry in town, was closed. Basket-making became a major industry in the town, and the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] was built through it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakville.ca/culturerec/pioneer-essay5.html|title=Oakville Pioneers|publisher=oakville.ca|accessdate= August 14, 2017}}</ref> In 1869, the population was 2,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/provinceontario00mcevgoog#page/n164/mode/2up|title=Page 343|publisher=archive.org|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref> The community was served by the [[Great Western Railway (Ontario)|Great Western Railway]] and it was a port on Lake Ontario.\n\nThe town eventually became industrialized with the opening of [[Citgo|Cities Service Canada]]\n(later [[British Petroleum Canada|BP Canada]], and now [[Petro Canada]]) and [[Shell Canada]] [[oil refineries]] (both now closed), the [[Procor]] factory (no longer manufacturing), and, most importantly, the [[Ford Motor Company of Canada|Ford Motor Company]]'s Canadian headquarters and [[Oakville Assembly|plant]], all close to the [[Canadian National Railway]] and the Queen Elizabeth Way highway between Toronto and Fort Erie (Buffalo).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lakewoodtravel.com/location/oakville|title=Oaxville Travel|publisher=lakewoodtravel.com|accessdate=August 14, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1962, the town of Oakville merged with its neighbouring villages ([[Bronte, Ontario|Bronte]], Palermo, Sheridan, and the remainder of [[Trafalgar Township]]) to become the new Town of Oakville, reaching northwards to [[Steeles Avenue]] in [[Milton, Ontario|Milton]]. In 1973, the restructuring of Halton County into Halton Region brought the northern border southwards to just north of the future [[Ontario Highway 407|Highway 407]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oakville.ca/assets/general%20-%20culture%20recreation/GeorgesSquareOakmap.pdf|title=Oakville Boundaries Map Pre 1973|publisher=oakville.ca|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Neighbourhoods==\nOakville's Planning Department divides the town into communities.

The franchise follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], an [[anthropomorphic]] blue hedgehog who battles the evil [[Doctor Eggman]], a [[mad scientist]]. The main ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' games are [[platformer]]s mostly developed by [[Sonic Team]]; other games, developed by various studios, include [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] in the [[racing video game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], [[party game|party]] and [[sports game|sports]] genres. The franchise also incorporates [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog printed media|printed media]], [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog features|animations]], a [[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|2020 feature film]], and merchandise.\n\nThe [[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|first ''Sonic'' game]], released in 1991 for the [[Sega Genesis]], was developed after Sega requested a mascot character to compete with [[Nintendo]]'s mascot [[Mario]]. Its success helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the [[16-bit era]] of the early 1990s. [[Sega Technical Institute]] developed the next three ''Sonic'' games in addition to ''[[Sonic Spinball]]'' (1993). After a hiatus during the unsuccessful [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] era, the first major 3D ''Sonic'' game, ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', was released in 1998 for the [[Dreamcast]]. Sega exited the console market and shifted to [[third-party development]] in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, [[Xbox]], and [[PlayStation]] systems.\n\nWhile ''Sonic'' games often have unique [[game mechanics]] and stories, they feature recurring elements such as the ring-based [[Health (game terminology)|health]] system, locations, and speedy gameplay. Games typically feature Sonic setting out to stop Eggman's schemes for world domination, and the player navigates [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and [[vertical loop]]s. While Sonic and Eggman were the only characters introduced in the first game, the series would go on to have a [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|large cast of characters]]; some, such as [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and [[Shadow the Hedgehog]], starred in self-titled spin-offs. The franchise has also been represented in [[Crossover (fiction)|crossovers]] such as ''[[Sega All-Stars (series)|Sega All-Stars]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the [[best-selling video game franchises]], selling 89{{nbsp}}million by March 2011 and grossing over {{US$|5 billion|long=no}} by 2014. Series sales and [[free-to-play]] [[mobile game]] downloads totaled 920{{nbsp}}million by 2019. The Genesis ''Sonic'' games have been described as representative of the [[culture of the 1990s]] and listed among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest of all time]]. Although later games have been criticized for a perceived decline in quality compared to earlier installments, ''Sonic'' is influential in the video game industry and is frequently referenced in popular culture.\n\n=={{anchor|Video games|History}}Development==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

The franchise follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]], an [[anthropomorphic]] blue hedgehog who battles the evil [[Doctor Eggman]], a [[mad scientist]]. The main ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' games are [[platformer]]s mostly developed by [[Sonic Team]]; other games, developed by various studios, include [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] in the [[racing video game|racing]], [[fighting game|fighting]], [[party game|party]] and [[sports game|sports]] genres. The franchise also incorporates [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog printed media|printed media]], [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog features|animations]], a [[Sonic the Hedgehog (film)|2020 feature film]], and merchandise.\n\nThe [[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|first ''Sonic'' game]], released in 1991 for the [[Sega Genesis]], was developed after Sega requested a mascot character to compete with [[Nintendo]]'s mascot [[Mario]]. Its success helped Sega become one of the leading video game companies during the [[16-bit era]] of the early 1990s. [[Sega Technical Institute]] developed the next three ''Sonic'' games in addition to ''[[Sonic Spinball]]'' (1993). After a hiatus during the unsuccessful [[Sega Saturn|Saturn]] era, the first major 3D ''Sonic'' game, ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'', was released in 1998 for the [[Dreamcast]]. Sega exited the console market and shifted to [[third-party development]] in 2001, continuing the series on Nintendo, [[Xbox]], and [[PlayStation]] systems.\n\nWhile ''Sonic'' games often have unique [[game mechanics]] and stories, they feature recurring elements such as the ring-based [[Health (game terminology)|health]] system, locations, and speedy gameplay. Games typically feature Sonic setting out to stop Eggman's schemes for world domination, and the player navigates [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and [[vertical loop]]s. While Sonic and Eggman were the only characters introduced in the first game, the series would go on to have a [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog characters|large cast of characters]]; some, such as [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], and [[Shadow the Hedgehog]], starred in self-titled spin-offs. The franchise has also been represented in [[Crossover (fiction)|crossovers]] such as ''[[Sega All-Stars (series)|Sega All-Stars]]'' and Nintendo's ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' is Sega's flagship franchise and one of the [[best-selling video game franchises]], selling 89{{nbsp}}million by March 2011 and grossing over {{US$|5 billion|long=no}} by 2014. Series sales and [[free-to-play]] [[mobile game]] downloads totaled 920{{nbsp}}million by 2019. The Genesis ''Sonic'' games have been described as representative of the [[culture of the 1990s]] and listed among the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest of all time]]. Although later games have been criticized for a perceived decline in quality compared to earlier installments, ''Sonic'' is influential in the video game industry and is frequently referenced in popular culture.\n\n=={{anchor|Video games|History}}Development==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.
