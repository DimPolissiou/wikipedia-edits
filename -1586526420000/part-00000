Since the [[Universalis Ecclesiae|re-establishment of the English Catholic dioceses in 1850]], each Archbishop of Westminster\u2014including the incumbent, Cardinal [[Vincent Gerard Nichols]]\u2014has been created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by the [[Pope]] in consistory, often as the only cardinal in England, and is now the 43rd of [[English cardinals]] since the 12th century.

However, as might be expected from a city as cosmopolitan as [[London]], there is a great diversity in the liturgy as celebrated by Catholics.  The [[Latin Mass Society]] celebrates the liturgy according to the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]]. The [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Greek Catholics]] have a strong presence in the diocese with their own cathedral in Binney Street close to [[Bond Street]].  There is a [[Maronite|Lebanese Maronite]] community based at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in Cirencester Street in West London; a [[Melkite]] community in [[Pimlico]], at St Barnabas' [[Church of England]] church; an [[Ethiopian Catholic Church|Ethiopian Catholic]] church, Our Lady Queen of Heaven, in [[Queensway (London)|Queensway]] West London; an Eritrean Catholic church, St Aidan of Lindisfarne, in East Acton; a [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean Catholic]] church, St Anne's, in Laxton Place and a [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church|Belarusian Catholic]] church in Holden Avenue in North London. There are also a large number of Masses for the expatriate Polish community; as well as French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish language churches.\n\nThe diocese is also responsible for many chaplaincies, including [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]], hospitals and prisons. See [[St. George's Interdenominational Chapel, Heathrow Airport]] for more information about the Heathrow Airport Latin-Church Catholic chaplaincy.\n\nThere are a large number of religious communities in the diocese.  Religious orders of men include: the [[Assumptionists]] at [[Bethnal Green]], [[Hitchin]] and Burnt Oak; the [[Augustinians]] at [[Hammersmith]] and Hoxton; the [[Augustinian Recollects]] at Kensal New Town, [[Kensington]] and [[Wembley]]; the Benedictines at [[Ealing Abbey]] and [[Cockfosters]]; the [[Carmelites]] at Finchley East; [[Discalced Carmelites]] at Kensington; the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] at [[Twickenham]]; the missionary [[Missionary Society of St. Columban|Columban Fathers]] at [[Hampstead]]; the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] at Haverstock Hill; the [[Franciscans]] at Pimlico; the [[Society of the Atonement|Franciscan Friars of the Atonement]] in Westminster; the [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] at New Barnett and [[Northwood, London|Northwood]]; and the [[Passionists]] at Highgate. The [[Jesuits]] have a large presence in London with communities in Mayfair (at Farm Street), Kensington, Kilburn, Osterley, Southall, Stamford Hill, Swiss Cottage and Willesden Green.  The [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorians]] are based at the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]] in Kensington, which is popularly known as the [[Brompton Oratory]] and is the largest church in the diocese after [[Westminster Cathedral]].\n\nReligious communities of women include the Carmelites at [[Golders Green]] and Ware; the [[Poor Clares]] in Barnet; the Franciscan Sisters of Our Lady of Victories at the cathedral; the Ursulines of Jesus at Hoxton, Kingsland and Stamford Hill; the Dominicans at Bushey, Cricklewood, Ealing, [[Edgware]], Harpenden, Harrow on the Hill, Haverstock Hill, Hemel Hempstead, Osterley, Stevenage and Pinner.  The Institute of the BVM is located in Swiss Cottage, Acton, Osterley, Redbourn and [[St Albans]].  The [[Sisters of Mercy]] are located at the cathedral, Acton East, Bethnal Green, Bow, Clapton Park, Commercial Road, Cricklewood, Feltham, Hampton Hill, Hillingdon, Kensal, Newtown, Marylebone Road, St Albans, St John's Wood, Twickenham and Underwood Road.

Some 159 state and 10 independent [[primary schools]] are run by the diocese along with 42 state and 4 independent [[secondary schools]].  There are also a further five independent primary / secondary and special schools including the Choristers school attached to the cathedral.\n\nMusic in the diocese is as diverse as the communities represented in it, but the all-male [[Choir|cathedral choir]] is reputedly one of the best in the country <ref name=\"charleston\">{{Cite news|work=Charleston City Paper| author=Lindsay Koob| title= The world's finest academic choir takes its audience to choral heaven| date=4 June 2010| accessdate=14 December 2010| publisher= charlestoncitypaper.com| url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/the-worlds-finest-academic-choir-takes-its-audience-to-choral-heaven/Content?oid=2039699}}</ref><ref name=\"journal\">{{cite news| title=Palestrina: Westminster Cathedral Choir| publisher= thefreelibrary.com Reviews| work= The Journal (Newcastle, England)| author=Tom Hall| date=12 May 2003}}</ref> and sings at all chief Masses in the cathedral as well as the daily [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine offices]].

Since the [[Universalis Ecclesiae|re-establishment of the English Catholic dioceses in 1850]], each Archbishop of Westminster\u2014including the incumbent, Cardinal [[Vincent Gerard Nichols]]\u2014has been created a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] by the [[Pope]] in consistory, often as the only cardinal in England, and is now the 43rd of [[English cardinals]] since the 12th century. It is also customary for the Archbishop of Westminster to be elected President of the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales]] providing a degree of a formal direction for the other English bishops and archbishops.

However, as might be expected from a city as cosmopolitan as [[London]], there is a great diversity in the liturgy as celebrated by Catholics.  The [[Latin Mass Society]] celebrates the liturgy according to the [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]]. The [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Greek Catholics]] have a strong presence in the diocese with their own cathedral in Binney Street close to [[Bond Street]].  There is a [[Maronite|Lebanese Maronite]] community based at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic Church in Cirencester Street in West London; a [[Melkite]] community in [[Pimlico]], at St Barnabas' [[Church of England]] church; an [[Ethiopian Catholic Church|Ethiopian Catholic]] church, Our Lady Queen of Heaven, in [[Queensway (London)|Queensway]] West London; an Eritrean Catholic church, St Aidan of Lindisfarne, in East Acton; a [[Chaldean Christians|Chaldean Catholic]] church, St Anne's, in Laxton Place and a [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church|Belarusian Catholic]] church in Holden Avenue in North London. There are also a large number of Masses for the expatriate Polish community; as well as French, German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish language churches.\n\nThe diocese is also responsible for many chaplaincies, including [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow Airport]], hospitals and prisons. See [[St. George's Interdenominational Chapel, Heathrow Airport]] for more information about the Heathrow Airport Latin-Church Catholic chaplaincy.\n\nThere are a large number of religious communities in the diocese.  Religious orders of men include: the [[Assumptionists]] at [[Bethnal Green]], [[Hitchin]] and Burnt Oak; the [[Augustinians]] at [[Hammersmith]] and Hoxton; the [[Augustinian Recollects]] at Kensal New Town, [[Kensington]] and [[Wembley]]; the Benedictines at [[Ealing Abbey]] and [[Cockfosters]]; the [[Carmelites]] at Finchley East; [[Discalced Carmelites]] at Kensington; the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] at [[Twickenham]]; the missionary [[Missionary Society of St. Columban|Columban Fathers]] at [[Hampstead]]; the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] at Haverstock Hill; the [[Franciscans]] at Pimlico; the [[Society of the Atonement|Franciscan Friars of the Atonement]] in Westminster; the [[Holy Ghost Fathers]] at New Barnett and [[Northwood, London|Northwood]]; and the [[Passionists]] at Highgate. The [[Jesuits]] have a large presence in London with communities in Mayfair (at Farm Street), Kensington, Kilburn, Osterley, Southall, Stamford Hill, Swiss Cottage and Willesden Green.  The [[Oratory of Saint Philip Neri|Oratorians]] are based at the [[Church of the Immaculate Heart of Mary]] in Kensington, which is popularly known as the [[Brompton Oratory]] and is the largest church in the diocese after [[Westminster Cathedral]].\n\nReligious communities of women include the Carmelites at [[Golders Green]] and Ware; the [[Poor Clares]] in Barnet; the Franciscan Sisters of Our Lady of Victories at the cathedral; the Ursulines of Jesus at Hoxton, Kingsland and Stamford Hill; the Dominicans at Bushey, Cricklewood, Ealing, [[Edgware]], Harpenden, Harrow on the Hill, Haverstock Hill, Hemel Hempstead, Osterley, Stevenage and Pinner.  The Institute of the BVM is located in Swiss Cottage, Acton, Osterley, Redbourn and [[St Albans]].  The [[Sisters of Mercy]] are located at the cathedral, Acton East, Bethnal Green, Bow, Clapton Park, Commercial Road, Cricklewood, Feltham, Hampton Hill, Hillingdon, Kensal, Newtown, Marylebone Road, St Albans, St John's Wood, Twickenham and Underwood Road.  The Servants of the Mother of God at [[Bayswater]], [[Hampton, London|Hampton]] and [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]].\n\nThe diocese is involved in both the independent and state school sectors. Some 159 state and 10 independent [[primary schools]] are run by the diocese along with 42 state and 4 independent [[secondary schools]].  There are also a further five independent primary / secondary and special schools including the Choristers school attached to the cathedral.\n\nMusic in the diocese is as diverse as the communities represented in it, but the all-male [[Choir|cathedral choir]] is reputedly one of the best in the country <ref name=\"charleston\">{{Cite news|work=Charleston City Paper| author=Lindsay Koob| title= The world's finest academic choir takes its audience to choral heaven| date=4 June 2010| accessdate=14 December 2010| publisher= charlestoncitypaper.com| url=http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/charleston/the-worlds-finest-academic-choir-takes-its-audience-to-choral-heaven/Content?oid=2039699}}</ref><ref name=\"journal\">{{cite news| title=Palestrina: Westminster Cathedral Choir| publisher= thefreelibrary.com Reviews| work= The Journal (Newcastle, England)| author=Tom Hall| date=12 May 2003}}</ref> and sings at all chief Masses in the cathedral as well as the daily [[Liturgy of the Hours|divine offices]].

It runs for about {{Convert|252|mi}} (including sections [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with other designations) from [[London]] to the [[Irish Sea]] at the [[ferry]] [[port of Holyhead]]. In many parts the route follows that of the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] [[Antonine Itinerary|Iter II]] route which later took the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] name [[Watling Street]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman Road===\n[[File:Watling Street route.jpg|thumb|left|Roman Britain, with the route of Watling Street in red]]\nThe section of the A5 between [[London]] and [[Shrewsbury]] is roughly contiguous with one of the principal [[Roman roads]] in Britain: that between ''[[London|Londinium]]'' and ''[[Chester|Deva]]'', which diverges from the present-day A5 corridor at [[Wroxeter]] (''[[Viroconium Cornoviorum]]'') near Shrewsbury.\n\n===Telford's Holyhead Road===\nThe [[Act of Union 1800]], which unified Great Britain and [[Ireland]], gave rise to a need to improve communication links between [[London]] and [[Dublin]]. A parliamentary committee led to an [[Act of Parliament]] of 1815 that authorised the purchase of existing [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] road interests and, where necessary, the construction of new road, to complete the route between the two capitals. This made it the first major civilian state-funded road building project in Britain since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times.  Responsibility for establishing the new route was awarded to the famous engineer, [[Thomas Telford]].\n\nThrough England, the road largely took over existing [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] roads and mainly following the route of the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''W\u00e6celinga Str\u00e6t'' ([[Watling Street]]), much of which had been historically the [[Roman road]] ''Iter II''. However between [[Weedon, Northamptonshire]] and [[Oakengates]], Telford's Holyhead Road eschews the Watling Street corridor, picking up instead the major cities of [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], and [[Wolverhampton]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Holyhead_Road |title=Holyhead Road |website=sabre-roads.org}}</ref> this routing being far more useful for communications.\n\nFrom [[Shrewsbury]] and through [[Wales]], Telford's work was more extensive. In places he followed existing roads, but he also built new links, including the [[Menai Suspension Bridge]] to connect the mainland with [[Anglesey]] and the [[Stanley Embankment]] to [[Holy Island, Anglesey|Holy Island]].\n\nTelford's road was complete with the opening of the [[Menai Suspension Bridge]] in 1826.\n\n====Notable features of Telford's road====\nThe road was designed to allow [[stagecoach]]es and the [[mail coach]] to carry post between London and Holyhead, and thence by mailboat to [[Ireland]]. Therefore, throughout its length the gradient never exceeds 1:17 (5.9%).\n\nThe route through Wales retains many of the original features of Telford's road and has, since 1995, been recognised as a historic route worthy of preservation. An 18-month survey by [[Cadw]] in 1998-2000 revealed that about 40% of the original road and its ancillary features survives under the modern A5, much more than previously thought.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/telford-highway-to-holyhead-found-intact-under-the-a5-710810.html Telford highway to Holyhead found intact under the A5] {{snd}} [[The Independent]], 5 August 2000</ref> These features include the following:\n\n* many surviving and distinctive [[Toll roads in Great Britain|toll houses]]\n* 'depots' along the route, being roadside alcoves to store grit and materials\n* distinctive [[milestone]]s at each mile - many originals having survived and been restored, others now replaced by replicas\n* distinctive gates in a '[[Sunburst|sunburst' design]], a few of which have survived\n* a [[weighbridge]] at Lon Isaf, between [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]]\n\n====T\u0177 Nant cutting====\nIn 1997, a section of bends on Telford's road between T\u0177 Nant and [[Dinmael]] was by-passed by a modern [[Cutting (transportation)|cutting]]. However, investigation in 2006 revealed that the rock face in the cutting had become unstable, and the A5 was closed from the end of May 2006.<ref>[http://new.wales.gov.uk/about/cabinet/cabinetstatements/2006/967635/?lang=en Closure Of A5 Trunk Road Between Ty Nant And Dinmael] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524060738/http://new.wales.gov.uk/about/cabinet/cabinetstatements/2006/967635/?lang=en |date=24 May 2011 }}</ref> Traffic was diverted onto the old A5 route, on a {{convert|0.5|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch known as the Glyn Bends, while the rock face was made safe. This involved the removal of 230,000 tonnes of rock and alluvial deposits. In July 2007, the A5 through the reconstructed cutting was reopened.<ref>[http://www.jones-bros-ruthin.co.uk/news2.html A5 at Ty Nant reopens ahead of schedule]</ref>\n\n==Route==\n===London - Milton Keynes===\nStarting at [[Marble Arch]] in [[London]], the A5 runs northwest on the [[Edgware Road]] through [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] and [[Cricklewood]]. The A5 number disappears at the [[A41 road|A41]] near [[Edgware]] but the original road continues as the [[A5183 road|A5183]] through [[Elstree]], [[Radlett]], [[St Albans]], [[Redbourn]] and [[Dunstable]]. A few miles north of Dunstable, the A5 regains its identity at the [[M1 motorway]] junction 11A, rejoining the old Roman Road and passing through [[Hockliffe]] before becoming a [[dual carriageway]] as it approaches Milton Keynes.\n\n===Milton Keynes - Hinckley===\nOn entering the [[Borough of Milton Keynes]], the road becomes an (almost) fully [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] dual carriageway and passes through [[Milton Keynes]]. This stretch was opened in 1980, replacing the original route along Watling Street.  From just north of MK, after entering [[Northamptonshire]], the road resumes as a single carriageway that continues through [[Towcester]] where it crosses the [[A43 road|A43 dual carriageway]] just north of the town. The road accompanies the [[Grand Union Canal]] and the [[M1 motorway]] through the [[Watford Gap]]. It then bridges the [[M45 motorway]] and continues to [[Kilsby]]. As it passes close to [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], the road is diverted slightly around the [[Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal]] and then passes the remains of the [[Rugby Radio Station]].\n\nThe next phase north-west-bound takes it under the [[M6 motorway]] and passing close to [[Lutterworth]]. Along this stretch, the road frequently alternates between being a single and a dual carriageway. After meeting the [[M69 motorway]] at a roundabout, with the motorway passing above, the A5 runs between Nuneaton and [[Hinckley]].\n\n===Hinckley - Shrewsbury===\nAfter this section the road continues to run through the northern fringes of [[Nuneaton]] and then on to  [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]]. At Tamworth, the road follows a more recent dual carriageway bypass, permitting the original alignment to become a local road in the town. From this point the road is a grade separated dual carriageway up until its junction with the [[A38 road|A38]] and [[M6 toll]]. After this junction it passes just to the south of [[Cannock]] and then enters [[Telford]], where it loses its identity and route-shares with the [[M54 motorway]] from junction 5. At junction 7 the motorway ends and the A5 continues to Shrewsbury as dual carriageway, on its new alignment. (The original route through Telford, and then via [[Atcham]] to Shrewsbury, is  unclassified through [[Oakengates]] and as the B5061 through [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] and the B4380 through Atcham). Continuing from the end of the M54, the route runs around [[Shrewsbury]] as the town's southern bypass (still as dual carriageway), combining for a stretch with the [[A49 road|A49]]. (The route once ran through the town, but was first bypassed in the 1930s, then by-passed again in the early 1990s).\n\n===Shrewsbury - Bangor===\nAfter Shrewsbury the A5 continues as single-carriageway except for the [[Nesscliffe]] bypass. It then multiplexes with the major [[South Wales]] {{snd}} [[North Wales]] road [[A483]] and forms part of the [[Oswestry]] bypass, running to the east of that town. Shortly after, it crosses the [[River Ceiriog]] and enters [[Wales]] to continue from [[Chirk]]. The A5 continues through [[Snowdonia]] via [[Llangollen]], [[Corwen]], [[Capel Curig]] and through the centre of [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]].\n\n===Bangor - Holyhead===\nFrom Bangor the road crosses the [[Menai Suspension Bridge]] to [[Anglesey]] and then runs roughly parallel to the [[A55 road|A55]] expressway to the outskirts of the village of [[Valley, Anglesey|Valley]] where the A5 continues onto the [[Stanley Embankment]]. The A5 from Valley to Holyhead is named London Road running through to the [[Port of Holyhead]].  The A5 traditionally terminated at [[Admiralty Arch, Holyhead|Admiralty Arch]] (1822\u201324) on Salt Island, which was designed by [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]] to commemorate a visit by King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in 1821 en route to Ireland and marks the zenith of Irish Mail coach operations.

It runs for about {{Convert|252|mi}} (including sections [[Concurrency (road)|concurrent]] with other designations) from [[London]] to the [[Irish Sea]] at the [[ferry]] [[port of Holyhead]]. In many parts the route follows that of the [[Roman Britain|Roman]] [[Antonine Itinerary|Iter II]] route which later took the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] name [[Watling Street]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Roman Road===\n[[File:Watling Street route.jpg|thumb|left|Roman Britain, with the route of Watling Street in red]]\nThe section of the A5 between [[London]] and [[Shrewsbury]] is roughly contiguous with one of the principal [[Roman roads]] in Britain: that between ''[[London|Londinium]]'' and ''[[Chester|Deva]]'', which diverges from the present-day A5 corridor at [[Wroxeter]] (''[[Viroconium Cornoviorum]]'') near Shrewsbury.\n\n===Telford's Holyhead Road===\nThe [[Act of Union 1800]], which unified Great Britain and [[Ireland]], gave rise to a need to improve communication links between [[London]] and [[Dublin]]. A parliamentary committee led to an [[Act of Parliament]] of 1815 that authorised the purchase of existing [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] road interests and, where necessary, the construction of new road, to complete the route between the two capitals. This made it the first major civilian state-funded road building project in Britain since [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times.  Responsibility for establishing the new route was awarded to the famous engineer, [[Thomas Telford]].\n\nThrough England, the road largely took over existing [[Turnpike trust|turnpike]] roads and mainly following the route of the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''W\u00e6celinga Str\u00e6t'' ([[Watling Street]]), much of which had been historically the [[Roman road]] ''Iter II''. However between [[Weedon, Northamptonshire]] and [[Oakengates]], Telford's Holyhead Road eschews the Watling Street corridor, picking up instead the major cities of [[Coventry]], [[Birmingham]], and [[Wolverhampton]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Holyhead_Road |title=Holyhead Road |website=sabre-roads.org}}</ref> this routing being far more useful for communications.\n\nFrom [[Shrewsbury]] and through [[Wales]], Telford's work was more extensive. In places he followed existing roads, but he also built new links, including the [[Menai Suspension Bridge]] to connect the mainland with [[Anglesey]] and the [[Stanley Embankment]] to [[Holy Island, Anglesey|Holy Island]].\n\nTelford's road was complete with the opening of the [[Menai Suspension Bridge]] in 1826.\n\n====Notable features of Telford's road====\nThe road was designed to allow [[stagecoach]]es and the [[mail coach]] to carry post between London and Holyhead, and thence by mailboat to [[Ireland]]. Therefore, throughout its length the gradient never exceeds 1:17 (5.9%).\n\nThe route through Wales retains many of the original features of Telford's road and has, since 1995, been recognised as a historic route worthy of preservation. An 18-month survey by [[Cadw]] in 1998-2000 revealed that about 40% of the original road and its ancillary features survives under the modern A5, much more than previously thought.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/telford-highway-to-holyhead-found-intact-under-the-a5-710810.html Telford highway to Holyhead found intact under the A5] {{snd}} [[The Independent]], 5 August 2000</ref> These features include the following:\n\n* many surviving and distinctive [[Toll roads in Great Britain|toll houses]]\n* 'depots' along the route, being roadside alcoves to store grit and materials\n* distinctive [[milestone]]s at each mile - many originals having survived and been restored, others now replaced by replicas\n* distinctive gates in a '[[Sunburst|sunburst' design]], a few of which have survived\n* a [[weighbridge]] at Lon Isaf, between [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] and [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]]\n\n====T\u0177 Nant cutting====\nIn 1997, a section of bends on Telford's road between T\u0177 Nant and [[Dinmael]] was by-passed by a modern [[Cutting (transportation)|cutting]]. However, investigation in 2006 revealed that the rock face in the cutting had become unstable, and the A5 was closed from the end of May 2006.<ref>[http://new.wales.gov.uk/about/cabinet/cabinetstatements/2006/967635/?lang=en Closure Of A5 Trunk Road Between Ty Nant And Dinmael] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524060738/http://new.wales.gov.uk/about/cabinet/cabinetstatements/2006/967635/?lang=en |date=24 May 2011 }}</ref> Traffic was diverted onto the old A5 route, on a {{convert|0.5|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch known as the Glyn Bends, while the rock face was made safe. This involved the removal of 230,000 tonnes of rock and alluvial deposits. In July 2007, the A5 through the reconstructed cutting was reopened.<ref>[http://www.jones-bros-ruthin.co.uk/news2.html A5 at Ty Nant reopens ahead of schedule]</ref>\n\n==Route==\n===London - Milton Keynes===\nStarting at [[Marble Arch]] in [[London]], the A5 runs northwest on the [[Edgware Road]] through [[Kilburn, London|Kilburn]] and [[Cricklewood]]. The A5 number disappears at the [[A41 road|A41]] near [[Edgware]] but the original road continues as the [[A5183 road|A5183]] through [[Elstree]], [[Radlett]], [[St Albans]], [[Redbourn]] and [[Dunstable]]. A few miles north of Dunstable, the A5 regains its identity at the [[M1 motorway]] junction 11A, rejoining the old Roman Road and passing through [[Hockliffe]] before becoming a [[dual carriageway]] as it approaches Milton Keynes.\n\n===Milton Keynes - Hinckley===\nOn entering the [[Borough of Milton Keynes]], the road becomes an (almost) fully [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] dual carriageway and passes through [[Milton Keynes]]. This stretch was opened in 1980, replacing the original route along Watling Street.  From just north of MK, after entering [[Northamptonshire]], the road resumes as a single carriageway that continues through [[Towcester]] where it crosses the [[A43 road|A43 dual carriageway]] just north of the town. The road accompanies the [[Grand Union Canal]] and the [[M1 motorway]] through the [[Watford Gap]]. It then bridges the [[M45 motorway]] and continues to [[Kilsby]]. As it passes close to [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]], the road is diverted slightly around the [[Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal]] and then passes the remains of the [[Rugby Radio Station]].\n\nThe next phase north-west-bound takes it under the [[M6 motorway]] and passing close to [[Lutterworth]]. Along this stretch, the road frequently alternates between being a single and a dual carriageway. After meeting the [[M69 motorway]] at a roundabout, with the motorway passing above, the A5 runs between Nuneaton and [[Hinckley]].\n\n===Hinckley - Shrewsbury===\nAfter this section the road continues to run through the northern fringes of [[Nuneaton]] and then on to  [[Tamworth, Staffordshire|Tamworth]]. At Tamworth, the road follows a more recent dual carriageway bypass, permitting the original alignment to become a local road in the town. From this point the road is a grade separated dual carriageway up until its junction with the [[A38 road|A38]] and [[M6 toll]]. After this junction it passes just to the south of [[Cannock]] and then enters [[Telford]], where it loses its identity and route-shares with the [[M54 motorway]] from junction 5. At junction 7 the motorway ends and the A5 continues to Shrewsbury as dual carriageway, on its new alignment. (The original route through Telford, and then via [[Atcham]] to Shrewsbury, is  unclassified through [[Oakengates]] and as the B5061 through [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] and the B4380 through Atcham). Continuing from the end of the M54, the route runs around [[Shrewsbury]] as the town's southern bypass (still as dual carriageway), combining for a stretch with the [[A49 road|A49]]. (The route once ran through the town, but was first bypassed in the 1930s, then by-passed again in the early 1990s).\n\n===Shrewsbury - Bangor===\nAfter Shrewsbury the A5 continues as single-carriageway except for the [[Nesscliffe]] bypass. It then multiplexes with the major [[South Wales]] {{snd}} [[North Wales]] road [[A483]] and forms part of the [[Oswestry]] bypass, running to the east of that town. Shortly after, it crosses the [[River Ceiriog]] and enters [[Wales]] to continue from [[Chirk]]. The A5 continues through [[Snowdonia]] via [[Llangollen]], [[Corwen]], [[Capel Curig]] and through the centre of [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]].\n\n===Bangor - Holyhead===\nFrom Bangor the road crosses the [[Menai Suspension Bridge]] to [[Anglesey]] and then runs roughly parallel to the [[A55 road|A55]] expressway to the outskirts of the village of [[Valley, Anglesey|Valley]] where the A5 continues onto the [[Stanley Embankment]]. The A5 from Valley to Holyhead is named London Road running through to the [[Port of Holyhead]].  The A5 traditionally terminated at [[Admiralty Arch, Holyhead|Admiralty Arch]] (1822\u201324) on Salt Island, which was designed by [[Thomas Harrison (architect)|Thomas Harrison]] to commemorate a visit by King [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] in 1821 en route to Ireland and marks the zenith of Irish Mail coach operations. The A5 currently terminates at the junction of the [[A55 road|A55]] near the [[Port of Holyhead]].\n\n==Alternative routes==\nParts of the A5 have been replaced by sections of the [[M1 motorway|M1]] north of [[Greater London|London]], the [[M54 motorway|M54]] through [[Telford]], the [[M6 motorway|M6]], and the [[M6 Toll]]. The [[A55 road|A55]] route in North Wales is now the usual way to get from [[Chirk]] to [[Holyhead]], avoiding the mountainous A5 route through [[Snowdonia]] and instead going via the much gentler [[Cheshire Plain]] and along the coast.\n\n==Road safety==\nIn June 2008, a {{Convert|9.9|mi|adj=on|0}} stretch of the A5 between Daventry and Rugby was named as the most dangerous road in the [[East Midlands]].<ref>[http://www.eurorap.org/library/pdfs/20080627_GB_High_RISK_Regional.pdf Highest risk road sections in each UK Government Office Region (2004-2006)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210151407/http://www.eurorap.org/library/pdfs/20080627_GB_High_RISK_Regional.pdf |date=10 February 2012 }}</ref>  This single carriageway stretch had fifteen fatal and serious injury collisions between 2004 and 2006, and was rated as 'red'\u2014the second highest risk band\u2014in the [[EuroRAP]] report publish by the Road Safety Foundation.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:marble.arch.london.arp.jpg|Marble Arch, London <br>&ndash; start of the A5\nImage:A5 Milton Keynes.JPG|A5 at [[Milton Keynes]] looking north at its junction with the [[A509 road|A509]]\nImage:M54Motorway.jpg|The A5 as it traverses rural [[Shropshire]] near [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]] on a new alignment to that of the original Thomas Telford route\nImage:A5-llwybrhanesyddol.JPG|Sign of Thomas Telford's historic route\nImage:Bont Borth.jpg|The A5 crosses the [[Menai Straits]] using the [[Menai Suspension Bridge]] \nImage:Admirality arch Holyhead.jpg|Admiralty Arch, Holyhead &ndash; end of the A5\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[A5 road (Isle of Man)]]\n*[[A5 road (Northern Ireland)]]\n*[[Trunk roads in Wales]]\n\n==References==\n* Quartermaine ''et al.''
