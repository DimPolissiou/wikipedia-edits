A member of this family is called a mephitid. The skunks of the family are widespread across the Americas, while the stink badgers are in the [[Greater Sunda Islands]] of southeast Asia. Species inhabit a variety of habitats, though typically grassland, forest, and shrubland. Most mephitids are {{convert|20|\u2013|50|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, plus a {{convert|10|\u2013|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tail, though the [[pygmy spotted skunk]] can be as small as 11 cm (4 in) plus a 7 cm (3 in) tail, and some [[striped skunk]]s can be up to 82 cm (32 in) plus a 40 cm (16 in) tail. Mephetids in general are not domesticated, though skunks are sometimes [[skunks as pets|kept as pets]].\n\nThe twelve species of Mephitidae are split into four [[genus|genera]]: the [[monotypic taxon|monotypic]] [[Conepatus]], hog-nosed skunks; [[Mephitis (genus)|Mephitis]], skunks; [[Mydaus]], stink badgers; and [[Spilogale]], spotted skunks. Mephitidae was traditionally a [[cladistics|clade]] within the [[Mustelidae]] family, with the stink badgers combined with other [[badger]]s within the ''[[Melinae]]'' genus, but more recent genetic evidence resulted in the consensus to separate Mephitidae into its own family.<ref name=\"Goswami2010\"/> Extinct species have also been placed into all of the extant genera besides ''Mydaus'', as well as 9 extinct genera; 26 extinct Mephitidae species have been found, though due to ongoing research and discoveries the exact number and categorization is not fixed.\n\n==Conventions==\n{{IUCN statuses|ex=0|ew=0|cr=0|en=0|vu=2|nt=0|lc=10|dd=0|ne=0}}\n\nConservation status codes listed follow the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]].

A member of this family is called a mephitid. The skunks of the family are widespread across the Americas, while the stink badgers are in the [[Greater Sunda Islands]] of southeast Asia. Species inhabit a variety of habitats, though typically grassland, forest, and shrubland. Most mephitids are {{convert|20|\u2013|50|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, plus a {{convert|10|\u2013|40|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} tail, though the [[Pygmy spotted skunk]] can be as small as 11 cm (4 in) plus a 7 cm (3 in) tail, and some [[striped skunk]]s can be up to 82 cm (32 in) plus a 40 cm (16 in) tail. Mephetids in general are not domesticated, though skunks are sometimes [[skunks as pets|kept as pets]].\n\nThe twelve species of Mephitidae are split into four [[genus|genera]]: the [[monotypic taxon|monotypic]] [[Conepatus]], hog-nosed skunks; [[Mephitis (genus)|Mephitis]], skunks; [[Mydaus]], stink badgers; and [[Spilogale]], spotted skunks. Mephitidae was traditionally a [[cladistics|clade]] within the [[Mustelidae]] family, with the stink badgers combined with other [[badger]]s within the ''[[Melinae]]'' genus, but more recent genetic evidence resulted in the consensus to separate Mephitidae into its own family.<ref name=\"Goswami2010\"/> Extinct species have also been placed into all of the extant genera besides ''Mydaus'', as well as 9 extinct genera; 26 extinct Mephitidae species have been found, though due to ongoing research and discoveries the exact number and categorization is not fixed.\n\n==Conventions==\n{{IUCN statuses|ex=0|ew=0|cr=0|en=0|vu=2|nt=0|lc=10|dd=0|ne=0}}\n\nConservation status codes listed follow the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) [[IUCN Red List|Red List of Threatened Species]].

The police force is largely made up of ex-bandits, and naturally the members are interested above all in saving their old friends from punishment. Policemen here are quite as much to be feared as the robbers; if they know you have money, they will be the first to knock you on the head. You pay them well to watch over your house, and they set it on fire. In short, I think that all the people concerned with justice or the police are in league with the criminals. The city is in a hopeless chaos, and many years must pass before order can be established. In a country where so many races are mingled, a severe and inflexible justice is desirable, which would govern with an iron hand.<ref>(De Russailh, Albert Bernard) Crane, Clarkson. Last Adventure- San Francisco in 1851. Translated from the Original Journal of Albert Bernard de Russailh by Clarkson Crane. San Francisco. The Westgate Press. 1931</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn October 28, 1853, the Board of Aldermen passed Ordinance No. 466, which provided for the reorganization of the police department. Sections one and two provided as follows:\n\n{{quote|The People of the City of San Francisco do ordain as follows:\n\nSec. 1. The Police Department of the City of San Francisco, shall be composed of a day and night police, consisting of 56 men (including a Captain and assistant Captain), each to be recommended by at least ten tax-paying citizens.\n\nSec. 2. There shall be one Captain and one assistant Captain of Police, who shall be elected in joint convention of the Board of Aldermen and assistant Aldermen. The remainder of the force, viz., 54 men, shall be appointed as follows: By the Mayor, 2; by the City Marshal, 2; by the City Recorder, 2; and by the Aldermen and assistant Aldermen, 3 each.}}\n\nIn July 1856, the \"Consolidation Act\" went into effect. This act abolished the office of City Marshal and created in its stead the office of Chief of Police. The first Chief of Police elected in 1856 was [[James F. Curtis]] a former member of the [[San Francisco Committee of Vigilance]].\n\nThe SFPD is known for being one of the pioneering forces for modern [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], beginning in the early 1900s.\n\n===1975 strike===\nIn early August 1975, the SFPD went on strike over a pay dispute, violating a California law prohibiting police from striking.<ref name=\"scholarship.law.berkeley.edu\">[http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2411&context=californialawreview Comment, ''Emergency Mayoral Power: An Exercise in Charter Interpretation'', 65 ''Cal.

Officers' stars are smooth polished metal, while those of Sergeants and above have decorative engraved designs. Those of Inspectors and above are 10k gold-filled badges instead of silver.\n*The uniform originally had no patch, as with officers of the LAPD. It was not until 1969 that the patch, incorporating the San Francisco crest of arms, [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and city motto was added to the uniform in 1970, adorning both sleeves.\n\n==Ranking structure==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Insignia\n|-\n| [[Chief of police|Chief]]\n| [[File:4 Gold Stars.svg|center|108px]]\n|-\n| [[Chief of police|Assistant Chief]]\n| [[File:3 Gold Stars.svg|center|81px]]\n|-\n| [[Chief of police|Deputy Chief]]\n| [[File:2 Gold Stars.svg|center|54px]]\n|-\n| [[Commander]]\n| [[File:1 Gold Star.svg|center|27px]]\n|-\n| [[Police captain|Captain]]\n| [[File:Captain insignia gold.svg|center|25px]]\n|-\n| [[Lieutenant#Police rank|Lieutenant]]\n| [[File:US-OF1B.svg|center|10px]]\n|-\n| [[Sergeant]]/[[Inspector]]\n| [[Image:NYPD Sergeant Stripes.svg|center|35px]]\n|-\n| [[Police Officer|Officer]]\n|[[File:SanFranciscoPoliceBadge.png|center|35px]]\n\n|}\n\nThe SFPD has supplemental levels for ranks up to captain, depending on P.O.S.T. certification. Example; Q-2, Q-3 or Q-4 Police Officer for Basic, Intermediate and Advanced [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (P.O.S.T.) certification. Inspectors do not use chevrons to identify their rank\u2014instead they wear a gold star badge similar to lieutenants and above. Sergeants and officers wear a silver star badge. Inspectors were initially the equivalent of a lieutenant rank and pay, but are now equivalent to a sergeant rank and pay. Tenured officers will have blue and gold hash-marks on the lower left sleeve of their Class A, B, and C (BDU) long-sleeved shirts. Each mark represents five years of service.\n\nSFPD members are also eligible for bronze, silver, and gold Medals of Valor. Annually the nominees for these awards are reviewed by a board of police captains.<ref>{{cite news |author=SFPD Northern Station Captain |date=July 2012 |work=Marina Times |url=http://www.marinatimes.com/2012/07/the-heroes-who-stand-among-us/ |title=The heroes who stand among us}}</ref> A Meritorious Conduct Award can also be awarded to department members.\n\n==San Francisco Police Reserve Officers==\n\n[[File:San Francisco Police Department Reserve Officer (badge).jpg|right|thumb|100px|SFPD Reserve Officers patch]]\n\nThe '''San Francisco Police Reserve Officer Unit''' is composed of individuals who wish to provide community service and give back to the city they live or work in. These officers understand the need for quality policing and community involvement, but cannot make the full commitment on becoming full-time peace officers.\n\nA San Francisco Police Reserve Officer is a POST (Police Officer Standards and Training)-certified peace officer who volunteers his or her time. A Reserve Officer is classified as a Q-0 and has the same duties and authority as a full-time paid Police Officer while on duty. Officers patrol in vehicles, on bikes, on foot, and in some cases on marine craft. Reserve officers must meet the same stringent and comprehensive POST standards and training as regular full-time police officers. Most San Francisco Police Reserve Officers are Level 1 Reserve Officers, which is the highest level that is recognized by the State of California. The SFPD does accept Level 2 or Level 3 Reserve Officers, but based upon their respective levels which determine how a Reserve Officer is deployed.\n\nReserve Officers are responsible for serving a minimum of 24 volunteer hours per month to retain peace officers status, although there are Reserve Officers who routinely contribute two to three times that number.\n\nReserve Officers are involved in many areas of police work. Although most reserve officers actively participate in patrol, others work for such details as Muni, the Fugitive Recovery Enforcement Team, Vice, juvenile, emergency operations, DUI check-points, transporting prisoners, Command Van duty, and fixed posts at special events like 49er Football games and Sigmund Stern Grove performances.\n\nReserves are now organized like a company, with a complement of 40 Reserve Officers divided into three squads, each with a designated squad sergeant. For special events like New Year's Eve, Halloween night, and other citywide events, Reserves are assigned as a squad.\n\nBefore Reserve candidates are considered, they must meet the same eligibility criteria as a Q-2 Police Officer Recruit. Furthermore, each candidate must completed the required training prior to being appointed as a Reserve Police Officer. Once appointed, that officer must attend Continuing Professional Training, which is consistent with the requirements of regular full-time Officers every two years. There is also a 400-hour Field Training Program that Level 1 Reserves Officers must complete with a FTO officer. Reserve officers are held to the same performance standards as a full-time Police Officer and serve at the pleasure of the Chief of Police.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==SWAT==\n[[File:San Francisco Police Department SWAT Team (badge).jpg|right|thumb|100px|Regular SFPD shoulder patch in subdued colors for SWAT work]]\nSan Francisco has been known for their elite [[SWAT]] team, composed of volunteer and selected officers from the entire agency. Most training is done in-house, with occasional and required training by [[FBI]] instructors, other Federal Agencies and private Military instruction. The SWAT division participates in planned and coordinated raids with agencies such as the [[FBI]], [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]]. As of 2007, it is mandatory that SWAT team members are together, sometimes during routine patrol, and can be seen among the streets of San Francisco in [[Battle Dress Uniform|BDU]] and traveling in a marked SUV, to ensure a quick and timely response to calls. They were under political fire in the highly publicized 1998 [[Western Addition]] Raid, in which more than 90 SFPD SWAT and Federal Agents raided a Western Addition housing project.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Horror of the \"War on Crime\" Swat Teams |author=Jim Hardin |publisher=Geocities |accessdate=September 7, 2011 |url=http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/7006/swat-rights.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026221458/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/7006/swat-rights.html |archivedate=October 26, 2009}}, republishing {{cite news |newspaper=San Francisco Bay Guardian |date=November 18, 1998 |title=\"War\" on Crime: The SFPD used SWAT-style equipment to raid a Western Addition housing project.

The unit was founded in 1909, and has grown ever since. They are officially under the command of the '''SFPD Traffic Division'''. They participate in many duties such as traffic enforcement, patrol, riot control, and special events and escorts. It is the only fully functional department that utilizes the entire traffic fleet for escorts in the nation. No other metropolitan city utilizes all its motor bikes for escorts but SFPD.\n\nThe entire 43-man unit is based at the Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant Street. Unlike most cities, they patrol as solo officers (hence the name SOLOS). They can frequently be seen throughout the city. The bulk of the unit is composed of [[Harley-Davidson]] Road King motorcycles. There is a separate division called Honda Unit, that is composed of [[Suzuki DR-Z400]]S [[Dual-sport motorcycle|dual-sport]] motorcycles (which is under the command of the Special Operations Bureau and not the same as Traffic), for city patrol and patrol in and around the area of [[Golden Gate Park]]. Otherwise, every one of the 10 main police stations in the city have 2 motorcycles under their command, used for patrol around their districts exclusively.\n\n==Aero Division==\nThe SFPD \"Aero\" Squadron was at its peak in the mid-1970s, with the number of helicopter and small plane flights rivaling the frequency of the Los Angeles Police Department. After several accidents (one of which a helicopter crashed in Lake Merced, killing Officer Charles Logasa in 1971) and complaints about the \"Eye in the Sky\" program, the unit was disbanded. The helicopter unit was featured prominently in the first [[Dirty Harry]] film, identifying a sniper on a roof top before a murder was committed. The unit was reactivated in the late 1990s, but after another fatal crash (which killed two SFPD officers, Kirk Bradley Brookbush and James Francis Dougherty) the Aero unit was put into an \"inactive\" status indefinitely. In times where it needs air support, the SFPD contacts the [[California Highway Patrol]] who has a Napa air base.\n\n==Police Academy==\nThe original San Francisco Police Academy was built in 1895 and was located on the West End adjacent to [[Golden Gate Park]]. The building, no longer in use, had the facilities to accommodate 25 trainees. In the 1960s, the building now used as the San Francisco Police Academy Complex was built originally as Diamond Heights Elementary School located at 350 Amber Drive, just behind the Diamond Heights Safeway. The building was built in the 1960s hugging the Diamond Heights/Glen Park Canyon. Almost immediately upon completion, the property was determined to be unsafe and sliding into the canyon. The school was closed for one year, shored up and reopened. It was closed as a public school in the 1980s. Subsequently, the building is used by the SFPD for training. It is surrounded by a heavily wooded forest area and is near a shopping mall and apartment complex. As of recently (2008), there are three academy classes in session annually, with individual classes taking place for 31 to 32 weeks, year round. Pier 94 is also used for vehicle training exercises and mock police [[car chase]]s, and [[Lake Merced]] is the location of the Academy's firing range. With a boom in retirees in the coming years, a projected 700+ officers will be hired within the next 5\u201310 years, meaning full academy classes for some time. Lateral officers are currently being hired, and are being hired on an ongoing basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-police.org/index.aspx?page=1652 |publisher=San Francisco Police Department |title=Lateral Entry Program |date=November 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Headquarters==\n[[File:San Francisco Hall of Justice 2017.jpg|thumb|San Francisco Hall of Justice, 850 Bryant Street.]]\nSFPD headquarters was located for a number of years{{vague|date=July 2018}} at the San Francisco Thomas J. Cahill Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant Street, which houses a number of criminal courts, jail facilities, investigative and support units, as well as \"Southern Station\". The Headquarters of the [[San Francisco Sheriff's Department]] is housed in an adjacent building. On April 16, 2015, the SFPD officially moved its headquarters to a new location at [[Mission Bay, San Francisco|Mission Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc7news.com/news/sfpd-headquarters-move-to-new-mission-bay-site-/573424/|title=SFPD headquarters move to new Mission Bay site|first=Vic|last=Lee|date=March 26, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==In popular media==\nThe SFPD has been portrayed in films such as ''[[The Sniper (1952 film)|The Sniper]]'', ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', ''[[Freebie and the Bean]]'', ''[[The Laughing Policeman (film)|The Laughing Policeman]]'', ''[[Bullitt]]'', the [[Dirty Harry (film series)|''Dirty Harry'' film series]], ''[[48 Hrs.]]'', ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', ''[[Metro (1997 film)|Metro]]'', ''[[Rush Hour (film series)|Rush Hour]]'', and ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'', as well as television series such as ''[[The Lineup (TV series)|The Lineup]]'' (aka ''San Francisco Beat''), ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[McMillan & Wife]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', ''[[The Division]]'', ''[[Killer Instinct (TV series)|Killer Instinct]]'', ''[[The Evidence (TV series)|The Evidence]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'' (1998\u20132006), ''[[Murder in the First (TV series)|Murder in the First]]'' and ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]''. The ''Dirty Harry'' film series is known for shaping the popular view of the department, with a hard-nosed stance on crime and often using \"cowboy\" tactics ([[shoot first]], [[stakeout]]s, and [[preemptive raid]]s).\n\nIn the days of [[old-time radio]], there were a number of drama series built around the activities of the SFPD. [[Carlton E. Morse]] created four different shows based on SFPD files for [[NBC]]'s Pacific Coast Network, ''[[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] Squad'', ''[[Barbary Coast, San Francisco|Barbary Coast]] Nights'', ''Killed in Action'', and ''To the Best of Their Ability''.\n\nThe SFPD has also had a strong presence in [[novel]]s and [[Short story|short stories]]. Sidney Herschel Small wrote a series of thirty stories that appeared in ''Detective Fiction Weekly'' between 1931 and 1936 featuring Sergeant Jimmy Wentworth, the head of the Chinatown Squad, whose adventures were presumably based, if loosely, on the activities of [[Jack Manion]], the real-life commander of SFPD's Chinatown detail. In the early 1960s, Breni James wrote two novels about Sergeant Gun Mattson, uniformed patrol supervisor at the [[Ingleside, San Francisco, California|Ingleside]] District Station, ''The Night of the Kill'' (1961), which was an [[Edgar Award|Edgar]] nominee for Best First Novel, and ''The Shakeup'' (1964). [[Ernest K. Gann]]'s 1963 novel, ''Of Good and Evil'', tells the story of one busy day in the professional life of San Francisco's police chief, Colin Hill, a character apparently modeled on SFPD's real-life chief at that time, [[Thomas J. Cahill]], to whom the book is dedicated. More recently, [[Collin Wilcox (writer)|Collin Wilcox]] wrote a long series featuring Lieutenant [[Frank Hastings]] of SFPD's Homicide Detail. [[Laurie R. King]] won an Edgar for her first novel, ''[[A Grave Talent]]'' (1993), which introduced Homicide Inspector Kate Martinelli, who has gone on to headline such books as ''[[With Child]]'' (1997), an Edgar nominee, and ''[[The Art of Detection]]'' (2006), winner of the [[Lambda Award]] for Best Lesbian Mystery Novel. [[James Patterson]]'s novels about Homicide Inspector [[Lindsay Boxer]], introduced in ''[[1st to Die]]'' (2001), have become best-sellers, and were the basis for the short-lived TV series ''[[Women's Murder Club (TV series)|Women's Murder Club]]''. Former SFPD detective and current [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] private investigator Jerry Kenneally has written two novels featuring Homicide Inspector Jack Kordic, ''The Conductor'' (1996) and ''The Hunted'' (1999). After a trilogy of police novels set in other parts of the Bay Area, retired [[San Jose Police Department|San Jose Police Chief]] [[Joseph D. McNamara]] wrote one novel, ''Code 211 Blue'' (1996), about a narcotics inspector who uncovers corruption within the SFPD. Another former cop, Robin Burcell, who spent twenty years in law enforcement, first as an officer in the [[Lodi, California|Lodi]] Police, then later as a criminal investigator for the [[Sacramento County]] [[District attorney|District Attorney's Office]], wrote four novels featuring Homicide Inspector Kate Gillespie, the first of which, ''Every Move She Makes'' (1999), won the [[Barry Award (for crime novels)|Barry]] for Best Paperback Original, and the third of which, ''Deadly Legacy'' (2003), won the [[Anthony Award|Anthony]] in the same category.\n\nSome San Francisco-set police novels have explored The City's rich history. ''With Siberia Comes a Chill'' (1990), by former [[Inyo County]] [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy Sheriff]] [[Kirk Mitchell]], features SFPD Homicide Inspector John Kost who, in April 1945, while conducting a murder investigation as the United Nations is meeting for the first time in San Francisco, finds himself pitted against an [[NKVD]] assassin. ''White Rabbit'' by David Daniels, set during 1967's [[Summer of Love]], follows Homicide Inspector John Sparrow as he pursues a [[serial killer]] stalking the residents of San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood.\n\nA future version of the SFPD play a minor role in a handful of missions in the [[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]] computer game, most notably they assist the military in stopping a van carrying drones to destroy the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Unfortunately they fail, resulting in the destruction of the bridge, pinning down an aircraft carrier. The main protagonist saves one SFPD sergeant from plunging to his death from the wreckage of the bridge.\nMost main protagonists of the [[iOS]] novel ''[[Cause of Death (game)|Cause of Death]]'' are officers of the SFPD. In fact, a main protagonist of the game (Malachi \"Mal\" Fallon) has his name taken from that of Malachi Fallon of the real SFPD.\n\nThe SFPD has been fictionalized in the 2004 video game [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] as the San Fierro Police Department and in the 2014 animated film [[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]] as the San Fransokyo Police Department.\n\n''[[The Mentalist]]'' character [[Teresa Lisbon]] is former SFPD.\n\nThe character of Beau from ''[[Colony (TV series)|Colony]]'' is a 30-year veteran of the department.\n\n==Controversies==\n{{Further|List of events in the history of the San Francisco Police Department}}\n[[File:Friendly peace protectors sfpd, mission district, san francisco (2012) (7276017438).jpg|thumbnail|left|SFPD officers at a protest in the Mission District]]\nThe SFPD has been frequently met with criticism, due to problems of accountability and corruption that plagued the department early in its inception. In 1937, an investigation, referred to as the \"Atherton Report,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/131865 |title=Smashwords \u2013 The 1937 San Francisco Police Graft Report by Edwin Atherton \u2013 A book by Hank Chapot |publisher=Smashwords.com |date=February 11, 2012}}</ref> by District Attorney [[Matthew Brady (district attorney)|Matthew Brady]] found that more than $1&nbsp;million per year was being pocketed by officers from regular payoffs by prostitution, gambling and other criminal interests. It has also dealt with attacks such as the [[Preparedness Day Bombing]] in 1916 and the [[San Francisco Police Department Park Station bombing]] in the 1960s by leftist [[Political radicalism|radicals]].\n\nRecent examples of controversy include racist and homophobic texts [https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-racist-police-text-messages-review-20150317-story.html], police shootings of citizens, the reaction to [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] bicycle rides and protests in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]] against U.S. foreign policy. The rate of complaints against officers and \"excessive force\" cases are lower relative to other big-city departments, such as the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], the [[NYPD]], or [[Chicago Police Department|CPD]]. But the city continues to have one of the highest complaint rates, particularly when analyzed on a per-capita basis, factoring in the relatively small population of San Francisco compared to Los Angeles or New York. This could be attributed to several factors, including the dramatic increase of so-called \"transient population\", or those coming to visit the city (increasing the population to approximately 1.3&nbsp;million), or the proactive nature of the Office of Citizen Complaints, or OCC. The OCC, created by San Francisco City Charter, has been known to solicit complaints from people contacted by police.\n\nNotable incidents and events include the [[Golden Dragon massacre]], a deadly shooting between Chinese gang members in the city's [[Chinatown]] district; the [[101 California Street shootings]] in 1993; and the death of Aaron Williams while in police custody in 1995. In the latter case, several officers were charged with using excessive force, including Marc Andaya, described as having kicked Williams when he was on the ground. After two years and revelations of numerous complaints and two federal lawsuits against Andaya as an officer with the Oakland Police Department before he moved to San Francisco, in June 1997 Andaya was fired by the San Francisco Police Commission. [[Van Jones]] and the [[Bay City PoliceWatch]] were credited with organizing and keeping up community pressure against the department on this case.<ref>[https://www.thenation.com/article/when-cops-are-killers/ Angela Ards, \"When Cops Are Killers\"], ''The Nation,'' February 18, 1999, accessed February 20, 2017</ref>\n\nThe crime lab's reputation worsened after an employee was arrested in March 2010 for stealing cocaine.

Alex Fagan Jr. is the son of SFPD Assistant Chief Alex Fagan, who later became Chief. Nine officers and Chief Earl Sanders were involved in a cover-up regarding the fight. This incident has led to a grand jury indictment of the parties involved. However, unable to prove that a cover-up existed, the district attorney dropped the charges against former Chief Earl Sanders. Acting Chief Alex Fagan also resigned. In 2006, a civil jury found former officers Fagan and Tonsing liable for damages suffered in the beating, awarding plaintiffs Snyder and Santoro $41,000 in compensation.\n\nPublic Defender Jeff Adachi released video footage from security cameras that showed different cases of SFPD officers entering apartments without warrants, plain-clothed officers not displaying badges, and officers removing belongings that were never accounted for in police reports and other court documents.

Francisco|City and County of San Francisco, California]]. The department's motto is the same as that of the city and county: ''Oro en paz, fierro en guerra'', Spanish for ''Gold in peace, iron in war''.\n\nThe SFPD is distinct from the [[San Francisco Sheriff's Department]], which is another county law enforcement agency within San Francisco. The SFPD (along with the [[San Francisco Fire Department]] and the San Francisco Sheriff's Department) serves an estimated population of 1.2&nbsp;million, including the daytime-commuter population and the thousands of other tourists and visitors, in the second most densely populated large city in North America. In 2000, it was the 11th largest police department in the United States.<ref name=\"usdoj1\">{{cite web |title=Police Departments in Large Cities, 1990\u20132000 |author=Brian A.

At the time, Chief Fallon had a force of one deputy captain, three sergeants and 30 officers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ackerson|first=Sherman|author2=Dewayne Tully|title=SFPD: SFPD History|publisher=San Francisco Police Department|url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/police_index.asp?id=20204|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807095555/http://www.sfgov.org/site/police_index.asp?id=20204|archivedate=August 7, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn 1851, Albert Bernard de Russailh wrote about the nascent San Francisco police force:\n\n<blockquote>As for the police, I have only one thing to say. The police force is largely made up of ex-bandits, and naturally the members are interested above all in saving their old friends from punishment. Policemen here are quite as much to be feared as the robbers; if they know you have money, they will be the first to knock you on the head. You pay them well to watch over your house, and they set it on fire. In short, I think that all the people concerned with justice or the police are in league with the criminals. The city is in a hopeless chaos, and many years must pass before order can be established. In a country where so many races are mingled, a severe and inflexible justice is desirable, which would govern with an iron hand.<ref>(De Russailh, Albert Bernard) Crane, Clarkson. Last Adventure- San Francisco in 1851. Translated from the Original Journal of Albert Bernard de Russailh by Clarkson Crane. San Francisco. The Westgate Press. 1931</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn October 28, 1853, the Board of Aldermen passed Ordinance No. 466, which provided for the reorganization of the police department. Sections one and two provided as follows:\n\n{{quote|The People of the City of San Francisco do ordain as follows:\n\nSec. 1. The Police Department of the City of San Francisco, shall be composed of a day and night police, consisting of 56 men (including a Captain and assistant Captain), each to be recommended by at least ten tax-paying citizens.\n\nSec. 2. There shall be one Captain and one assistant Captain of Police, who shall be elected in joint convention of the Board of Aldermen and assistant Aldermen. The remainder of the force, viz., 54 men, shall be appointed as follows: By the Mayor, 2; by the City Marshal, 2; by the City Recorder, 2; and by the Aldermen and assistant Aldermen, 3 each.}}\n\nIn July 1856, the \"Consolidation Act\" went into effect. This act abolished the office of City Marshal and created in its stead the office of Chief of Police. The first Chief of Police elected in 1856 was [[James F. Curtis]] a former member of the [[San Francisco Committee of Vigilance]].\n\nThe SFPD is known for being one of the pioneering forces for modern [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]], beginning in the early 1900s.\n\n===1975 strike===\nIn early August 1975, the SFPD went on strike over a pay dispute, violating a California law prohibiting police from striking.<ref name=\"scholarship.law.berkeley.edu\">[http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2411&context=californialawreview Comment, ''Emergency Mayoral Power: An Exercise in Charter Interpretation'', 65 ''Cal.

Like most police agencies throughout California, SFPD patrol units are painted in black clearcoat with the roof, doors, and pillars painted white from the factory. The front doors bear a blue seven-pointed star with the letters \"S.F.P.D.\" printed in gold. This decal is also printed on the trunk, either near the center of the decklid (on sedans) or near the right taillight (on SUVs). The car's 'shop number' (used to identify all vehicles operated by the city) is printed on the front doors below the A-pillars, on the trunk near the left rear taillight, and on the roof to help air units visually identify cars. On the rear side panels on both sides of the car is a sticker reading \"EMERGENCY DIAL 911\".\n\n===Uniform===\n[[File:Present and accounted for pink saturday, san francisco (2012) (7458260688).jpg|right|thumb|3 SFPD officers in uniform.]]\n\n*The standard [[uniform]] is composed of a dark blue shirt and pants, with black braid, brass buttons which are stamped with the city seal and \"SF POLICE.\" The black braid down the length of the pant increases in width as one advances up the ranks.\n*Mounted police have a gold stripe going down the uniform pants\n*Traffic Company have the \"winged wheel\" patch on the right sleeve of any long sleeve garment\n*The [[Peaked cap]] of the officers has an 8-Point design unlike the \"air force smooth cap\" design of the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] or [[SFFD]]. The hat is adorned with a brass hat piece depicting the Arms of San Francisco.\n*The uniform \"badge\" for Officers rank is a [[sterling silver]] seven-point star of a design basically unchanged since 1849. The terms \"badge\" or \"shield\" are not used by the department in any form. The \"badge\" worn by all officers of the department is referred to as a \"star\" and is recognized as such by the City and the department. Officers' stars are smooth polished metal, while those of Sergeants and above have decorative engraved designs. Those of Inspectors and above are 10k gold-filled badges instead of silver.\n*The uniform originally had no patch, as with officers of the LAPD. It was not until 1969 that the patch, incorporating the San Francisco crest of arms, [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] and city motto was added to the uniform in 1970, adorning both sleeves.\n\n==Ranking structure==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}\n{| cellpadding=\"5\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Title\n!Insignia\n|-\n| [[Chief of police|Chief]]\n| [[File:4 Gold Stars.svg|center|108px]]\n|-\n| [[Chief of police|Assistant Chief]]\n| [[File:3 Gold Stars.svg|center|81px]]\n|-\n| [[Chief of police|Deputy Chief]]\n| [[File:2 Gold Stars.svg|center|54px]]\n|-\n| [[Commander]]\n| [[File:1 Gold Star.svg|center|27px]]\n|-\n| [[Police captain|Captain]]\n| [[File:Captain insignia gold.svg|center|25px]]\n|-\n| [[Lieutenant#Police rank|Lieutenant]]\n| [[File:US-OF1B.svg|center|10px]]\n|-\n| [[Sergeant]]/[[Inspector]]\n| [[Image:NYPD Sergeant Stripes.svg|center|35px]]\n|-\n| [[Police Officer|Officer]]\n|[[File:SanFranciscoPoliceBadge.png|center|35px]]\n\n|}\n\nThe SFPD has supplemental levels for ranks up to captain, depending on P.O.S.T. certification. Example; Q-2, Q-3 or Q-4 Police Officer for Basic, Intermediate and Advanced [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (P.O.S.T.) certification. Inspectors do not use chevrons to identify their rank\u2014instead they wear a gold star badge similar to lieutenants and above. Sergeants and officers wear a silver star badge. Inspectors were initially the equivalent of a lieutenant rank and pay, but are now equivalent to a sergeant rank and pay. Tenured officers will have blue and gold hash-marks on the lower left sleeve of their Class A, B, and C (BDU) long-sleeved shirts. Each mark represents five years of service.\n\nSFPD members are also eligible for bronze, silver, and gold Medals of Valor. Annually the nominees for these awards are reviewed by a board of police captains.<ref>{{cite news |author=SFPD Northern Station Captain |date=July 2012 |work=Marina Times |url=http://www.marinatimes.com/2012/07/the-heroes-who-stand-among-us/ |title=The heroes who stand among us}}</ref> A Meritorious Conduct Award can also be awarded to department members.\n\n==San Francisco Police Reserve Officers==\n\n[[File:San Francisco Police Department Reserve Officer (badge).jpg|right|thumb|100px|SFPD Reserve Officers patch]]\n\nThe '''San Francisco Police Reserve Officer Unit''' is composed of individuals who wish to provide community service and give back to the city they live or work in. These officers understand the need for quality policing and community involvement, but cannot make the full commitment on becoming full-time peace officers.\n\nA San Francisco Police Reserve Officer is a POST (Police Officer Standards and Training)-certified peace officer who volunteers his or her time. A Reserve Officer is classified as a Q-0 and has the same duties and authority as a full-time paid Police Officer while on duty. Officers patrol in vehicles, on bikes, on foot, and in some cases on marine craft. Reserve officers must meet the same stringent and comprehensive POST standards and training as regular full-time police officers. Most San Francisco Police Reserve Officers are Level 1 Reserve Officers, which is the highest level that is recognized by the State of California. The SFPD does accept Level 2 or Level 3 Reserve Officers, but based upon their respective levels which determine how a Reserve Officer is deployed.\n\nReserve Officers are responsible for serving a minimum of 24 volunteer hours per month to retain peace officers status, although there are Reserve Officers who routinely contribute two to three times that number.\n\nReserve Officers are involved in many areas of police work. Although most reserve officers actively participate in patrol, others work for such details as Muni, the Fugitive Recovery Enforcement Team, Vice, juvenile, emergency operations, DUI check-points, transporting prisoners, Command Van duty, and fixed posts at special events like 49er Football games and Sigmund Stern Grove performances.\n\nReserves are now organized like a company, with a complement of 40 Reserve Officers divided into three squads, each with a designated squad sergeant. For special events like New Year's Eve, Halloween night, and other citywide events, Reserves are assigned as a squad.\n\nBefore Reserve candidates are considered, they must meet the same eligibility criteria as a Q-2 Police Officer Recruit. Furthermore, each candidate must completed the required training prior to being appointed as a Reserve Police Officer. Once appointed, that officer must attend Continuing Professional Training, which is consistent with the requirements of regular full-time Officers every two years. There is also a 400-hour Field Training Program that Level 1 Reserves Officers must complete with a FTO officer. Reserve officers are held to the same performance standards as a full-time Police Officer and serve at the pleasure of the Chief of Police.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n==SWAT==\n[[File:San Francisco Police Department SWAT Team (badge).jpg|right|thumb|100px|Regular SFPD shoulder patch in subdued colors for SWAT work]]\nSan Francisco has been known for their elite [[SWAT]] team, composed of volunteer and selected officers from the entire agency. Most training is done in-house, with occasional and required training by [[FBI]] instructors, other Federal Agencies and private Military instruction. The SWAT division participates in planned and coordinated raids with agencies such as the [[FBI]], [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]], and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]]. As of 2007, it is mandatory that SWAT team members are together, sometimes during routine patrol, and can be seen among the streets of San Francisco in [[Battle Dress Uniform|BDU]] and traveling in a marked SUV, to ensure a quick and timely response to calls. They were under political fire in the highly publicized 1998 [[Western Addition]] Raid, in which more than 90 SFPD SWAT and Federal Agents raided a Western Addition housing project.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Horror of the \"War on Crime\" Swat Teams |author=Jim Hardin |publisher=Geocities |accessdate=September 7, 2011 |url=http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/7006/swat-rights.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026221458/http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/7006/swat-rights.html |archivedate=October 26, 2009}}, republishing {{cite news |newspaper=San Francisco Bay Guardian |date=November 18, 1998 |title=\"War\" on Crime: The SFPD used SWAT-style equipment to raid a Western Addition housing project.

The unit was founded in 1909, and has grown ever since. They are officially under the command of the '''SFPD Traffic Division'''. They participate in many duties such as traffic enforcement, patrol, riot control, and special events and escorts. It is the only fully functional department that utilizes the entire traffic fleet for escorts in the nation. No other metropolitan city utilizes all its motor bikes for escorts but SFPD.\n\nThe entire 43-man unit is based at the Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant Street. Unlike most cities, they patrol as solo officers (hence the name SOLOS). They can frequently be seen throughout the city. The bulk of the unit is composed of [[Harley-Davidson]] Road King motorcycles. There is a separate division called Honda Unit, that is composed of [[Suzuki DR-Z400]]S [[Dual-sport motorcycle|dual-sport]] motorcycles (which is under the command of the Special Operations Bureau and not the same as Traffic), for city patrol and patrol in and around the area of [[Golden Gate Park]]. Otherwise, every one of the 10 main police stations in the city have 2 motorcycles under their command, used for patrol around their districts exclusively.\n\n==Aero Division==\nThe SFPD \"Aero\" Squadron was at its peak in the mid-1970s, with the number of helicopter and small plane flights rivaling the frequency of the Los Angeles Police Department. After several accidents (one of which a helicopter crashed in Lake Merced, killing Officer Charles Logasa in 1971) and complaints about the \"Eye in the Sky\" program, the unit was disbanded. The helicopter unit was featured prominently in the first [[Dirty Harry]] film, identifying a sniper on a roof top before a murder was committed. The unit was reactivated in the late 1990s, but after another fatal crash (which killed two SFPD officers, Kirk Bradley Brookbush and James Francis Dougherty) the Aero unit was put into an \"inactive\" status indefinitely. In times where it needs air support, the SFPD contacts the [[California Highway Patrol]] who has a Napa air base.\n\n==Police Academy==\nThe original San Francisco Police Academy was built in 1895 and was located on the West End adjacent to [[Golden Gate Park]]. The building, no longer in use, had the facilities to accommodate 25 trainees. In the 1960s, the building now used as the San Francisco Police Academy Complex was built originally as Diamond Heights Elementary School located at 350 Amber Drive, just behind the Diamond Heights Safeway. The building was built in the 1960s hugging the Diamond Heights/Glen Park Canyon. Almost immediately upon completion, the property was determined to be unsafe and sliding into the canyon. The school was closed for one year, shored up and reopened. It was closed as a public school in the 1980s. Subsequently, the building is used by the SFPD for training. It is surrounded by a heavily wooded forest area and is near a shopping mall and apartment complex. As of recently (2008), there are three academy classes in session annually, with individual classes taking place for 31 to 32 weeks, year round. Pier 94 is also used for vehicle training exercises and mock police [[car chase]]s, and [[Lake Merced]] is the location of the Academy's firing range. With a boom in retirees in the coming years, a projected 700+ officers will be hired within the next 5\u201310 years, meaning full academy classes for some time. Lateral officers are currently being hired, and are being hired on an ongoing basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-police.org/index.aspx?page=1652 |publisher=San Francisco Police Department |title=Lateral Entry Program |date=November 5, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Headquarters==\n[[File:San Francisco Hall of Justice 2017.jpg|thumb|San Francisco Hall of Justice, 850 Bryant Street.]]\nSFPD headquarters was located for a number of years{{vague|date=July 2018}} at the San Francisco Thomas J. Cahill Hall of Justice at 850 Bryant Street, which houses a number of criminal courts, jail facilities, investigative and support units, as well as \"Southern Station\". The Headquarters of the [[San Francisco Sheriff's Department]] is housed in an adjacent building. On April 16, 2015, the SFPD officially moved its headquarters to a new location at [[Mission Bay, San Francisco|Mission Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abc7news.com/news/sfpd-headquarters-move-to-new-mission-bay-site-/573424/|title=SFPD headquarters move to new Mission Bay site|first=Vic|last=Lee|date=March 26, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==In popular media==\nThe SFPD has been portrayed in films such as ''[[The Sniper (1952 film)|The Sniper]]'', ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', ''[[Freebie and the Bean]]'', ''[[The Laughing Policeman (film)|The Laughing Policeman]]'', ''[[Bullitt]]'', the [[Dirty Harry (film series)|''Dirty Harry'' film series]], ''[[48 Hrs.]]'', ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', ''[[Metro (1997 film)|Metro]]'', ''[[Rush Hour (film series)|Rush Hour]]'', and ''[[Zodiac (film)|Zodiac]]'', as well as television series such as ''[[The Lineup (TV series)|The Lineup]]'' (aka ''San Francisco Beat''), ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[McMillan & Wife]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', ''[[The Division]]'', ''[[Killer Instinct (TV series)|Killer Instinct]]'', ''[[The Evidence (TV series)|The Evidence]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'' (1998\u20132006), ''[[Murder in the First (TV series)|Murder in the First]]'' and ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]''. The ''Dirty Harry'' film series is known for shaping the popular view of the department, with a hard-nosed stance on crime and often using \"cowboy\" tactics ([[shoot first]], [[stakeout]]s, and [[preemptive raid]]s).\n\nIn the days of [[old-time radio]], there were a number of drama series built around the activities of the SFPD. [[Carlton E. Morse]] created four different shows based on SFPD files for [[NBC]]'s Pacific Coast Network, ''[[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] Squad'', ''[[Barbary Coast, San Francisco|Barbary Coast]] Nights'', ''Killed in Action'', and ''To the Best of Their Ability''.\n\nThe SFPD has also had a strong presence in [[novel]]s and [[Short story|short stories]]. Sidney Herschel Small wrote a series of thirty stories that appeared in ''Detective Fiction Weekly'' between 1931 and 1936 featuring Sergeant Jimmy Wentworth, the head of the Chinatown Squad, whose adventures were presumably based, if loosely, on the activities of [[Jack Manion]], the real-life commander of SFPD's Chinatown detail. In the early 1960s, Breni James wrote two novels about Sergeant Gun Mattson, uniformed patrol supervisor at the [[Ingleside, San Francisco, California|Ingleside]] District Station, ''The Night of the Kill'' (1961), which was an [[Edgar Award|Edgar]] nominee for Best First Novel, and ''The Shakeup'' (1964). [[Ernest K. Gann]]'s 1963 novel, ''Of Good and Evil'', tells the story of one busy day in the professional life of San Francisco's police chief, Colin Hill, a character apparently modeled on SFPD's real-life chief at that time, [[Thomas J. Cahill]], to whom the book is dedicated. More recently, [[Collin Wilcox (writer)|Collin Wilcox]] wrote a long series featuring Lieutenant [[Frank Hastings]] of SFPD's Homicide Detail. [[Laurie R. King]] won an Edgar for her first novel, ''[[A Grave Talent]]'' (1993), which introduced Homicide Inspector Kate Martinelli, who has gone on to headline such books as ''[[With Child]]'' (1997), an Edgar nominee, and ''[[The Art of Detection]]'' (2006), winner of the [[Lambda Award]] for Best Lesbian Mystery Novel. [[James Patterson]]'s novels about Homicide Inspector [[Lindsay Boxer]], introduced in ''[[1st to Die]]'' (2001), have become best-sellers, and were the basis for the short-lived TV series ''[[Women's Murder Club (TV series)|Women's Murder Club]]''. Former SFPD detective and current [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] private investigator Jerry Kenneally has written two novels featuring Homicide Inspector Jack Kordic, ''The Conductor'' (1996) and ''The Hunted'' (1999). After a trilogy of police novels set in other parts of the Bay Area, retired [[San Jose Police Department|San Jose Police Chief]] [[Joseph D. McNamara]] wrote one novel, ''Code 211 Blue'' (1996), about a narcotics inspector who uncovers corruption within the SFPD. Another former cop, Robin Burcell, who spent twenty years in law enforcement, first as an officer in the [[Lodi, California|Lodi]] Police, then later as a criminal investigator for the [[Sacramento County]] [[District attorney|District Attorney's Office]], wrote four novels featuring Homicide Inspector Kate Gillespie, the first of which, ''Every Move She Makes'' (1999), won the [[Barry Award (for crime novels)|Barry]] for Best Paperback Original, and the third of which, ''Deadly Legacy'' (2003), won the [[Anthony Award|Anthony]] in the same category.\n\nSome San Francisco-set police novels have explored The City's rich history. ''With Siberia Comes a Chill'' (1990), by former [[Inyo County]] [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy Sheriff]] [[Kirk Mitchell]], features SFPD Homicide Inspector John Kost who, in April 1945, while conducting a murder investigation as the United Nations is meeting for the first time in San Francisco, finds himself pitted against an [[NKVD]] assassin. ''White Rabbit'' by David Daniels, set during 1967's [[Summer of Love]], follows Homicide Inspector John Sparrow as he pursues a [[serial killer]] stalking the residents of San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] neighborhood.\n\nA future version of the SFPD play a minor role in a handful of missions in the [[Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare]] computer game, most notably they assist the military in stopping a van carrying drones to destroy the [[Golden Gate Bridge]]. Unfortunately they fail, resulting in the destruction of the bridge, pinning down an aircraft carrier. The main protagonist saves one SFPD sergeant from plunging to his death from the wreckage of the bridge.\nMost main protagonists of the [[iOS]] novel ''[[Cause of Death (game)|Cause of Death]]'' are officers of the SFPD. In fact, a main protagonist of the game (Malachi \"Mal\" Fallon) has his name taken from that of Malachi Fallon of the real SFPD.\n\nThe SFPD has been fictionalized in the 2004 video game [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]] as the San Fierro Police Department and in the 2014 animated film [[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]] as the San Fransokyo Police Department.\n\n''[[The Mentalist]]'' character [[Teresa Lisbon]] is former SFPD.\n\nThe character of Beau from ''[[Colony (TV series)|Colony]]'' is a 30-year veteran of the department.\n\n==Controversies==\n{{Further|List of events in the history of the San Francisco Police Department}}\n[[File:Friendly peace protectors sfpd, mission district, san francisco (2012) (7276017438).jpg|thumbnail|left|SFPD officers at a protest in the Mission District]]\nThe SFPD has been frequently met with criticism, due to problems of accountability and corruption that plagued the department early in its inception. In 1937, an investigation, referred to as the \"Atherton Report,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smashwords.com/books/view/131865 |title=Smashwords \u2013 The 1937 San Francisco Police Graft Report by Edwin Atherton \u2013 A book by Hank Chapot |publisher=Smashwords.com |date=February 11, 2012}}</ref> by District Attorney [[Matthew Brady (district attorney)|Matthew Brady]] found that more than $1&nbsp;million per year was being pocketed by officers from regular payoffs by prostitution, gambling and other criminal interests. It has also dealt with attacks such as the [[Preparedness Day Bombing]] in 1916 and the [[San Francisco Police Department Park Station bombing]] in the 1960s by leftist [[Political radicalism|radicals]].\n\nRecent examples of controversy include racist and homophobic texts [https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-racist-police-text-messages-review-20150317-story.html], police shootings of citizens, the reaction to [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] bicycle rides and protests in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]] against U.S. foreign policy. The rate of complaints against officers and \"excessive force\" cases are lower relative to other big-city departments, such as the [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]], the [[NYPD]], or [[Chicago Police Department|CPD]]. But the city continues to have one of the highest complaint rates, particularly when analyzed on a per-capita basis, factoring in the relatively small population of San Francisco compared to Los Angeles or New York. This could be attributed to several factors, including the dramatic increase of so-called \"transient population\", or those coming to visit the city (increasing the population to approximately 1.3&nbsp;million), or the proactive nature of the Office of Citizen Complaints, or OCC. The OCC, created by San Francisco City Charter, has been known to solicit complaints from people contacted by police.\n\nNotable incidents and events include the [[Golden Dragon massacre]], a deadly shooting between Chinese gang members in the city's [[Chinatown]] district; the [[101 California Street shootings]] in 1993; and the death of Aaron Williams while in police custody in 1995. In the latter case, several officers were charged with using excessive force, including Marc Andaya, described as having kicked Williams when he was on the ground. After two years and revelations of numerous complaints and two federal lawsuits against Andaya as an officer with the Oakland Police Department before he moved to San Francisco, in June 1997 Andaya was fired by the San Francisco Police Commission. [[Van Jones]] and the [[Bay City PoliceWatch]] were credited with organizing and keeping up community pressure against the department on this case.<ref>[https://www.thenation.com/article/when-cops-are-killers/ Angela Ards, \"When Cops Are Killers\"], ''The Nation,'' February 18, 1999, accessed February 20, 2017</ref>\n\nThe crime lab's reputation worsened after an employee was arrested in March 2010 for stealing cocaine.

Alex Fagan Jr. is the son of SFPD Assistant Chief Alex Fagan, who later became Chief. Nine officers and Chief Earl Sanders were involved in a cover-up regarding the fight. This incident has led to a grand jury indictment of the parties involved. However, unable to prove that a cover-up existed, the district attorney dropped the charges against former Chief Earl Sanders. Acting Chief Alex Fagan also resigned. In 2006, a civil jury found former officers Fagan and Tonsing liable for damages suffered in the beating, awarding plaintiffs Snyder and Santoro $41,000 in compensation.\n\nPublic Defender Jeff Adachi released video footage from security cameras that showed different cases of SFPD officers entering apartments without warrants, plain-clothed officers not displaying badges, and officers removing belongings that were never accounted for in police reports and other court documents. In March 2011, the FBI opened an investigation into alleged police misconduct.<ref>http://abc7news.com/archive/7994090/</ref> The misconduct resulted in the DA dismissing 57 criminal cases because the scandal had compromised them.<ref>District Attorney Throws Out 57 Cases After Henry Hotel Scandal, Cops Pissed, by Lauren Smiley, March 9, 2011, ''SF Weekly''</ref>\n\nIn 2012, 12 employees (sworn or unsworn) of the department were charged with crimes.

Criticism of police pay and benefits is hardly unprecedented. For decades, the Police Department has weathered intermittent attacks, only to emerge with its compensation largely unaffected.

L. Sclater, the well-known Secretary of the Zoological Society, signed by Mr. Charles Darwin, Sir J. Hooker, Professor Huxley, Sir J. Lubbock, Prof. W. H. Flower, and by Mr. Sclater himself, and presented to the Secretary of State for India. This memorial recommended the preparation of a series of Handbooks of Indian Zoology and my appointment as Editor. It is scarcely necessary to add that to the recommendation of men so highly respected and so well known in the world of Science the publication of the present ''Fauna of British India'' is greatly due, and that Mr. Sclater is entitled to the thanks of all interested in the Zoology of India for the important part he took in the transaction. I can only express a hope that the present series as a whole may be worthy of the distinguished support to which, in so great a degree, it owes its origin.}}\n\nThe idea was to cover initially the vertebrates, taking seven volumes, and this was followed by a proposal to cover the invertebrates in about 15 to 20 volumes and projected to cost \u00a311,250 to \u00a315,000. Blanford suggested that restricting it to 14 volumes would make it possible to limit the cost to \u00a310,500.<ref>[http://www.abhilekh-patal.in/jspui/handle/123456789/2727648 National Archive of India PR_000003044449 1890 - Proposal of Mr W.T.Blanford for the publication of a second series of the \"Fauna of British India\" No. 74. India Office, London 21st November 1889]</ref>  After Blanford's death, [[Arthur Shipley|Arthur Everett Shipley]] became the editor. The first series was followed by a second edition of some of the volumes such as the mammals, birds, reptiles and butterflies.  In 1922-23, [[Nelson Annandale]] sought to move the process of preparation of the books and its publication to India.<ref>[http://www.abhilekh-patal.in/jspui/handle/123456789/2738954 National Archives of India 1922 File:PR_000003005771 September 1922 Proposal to transfer the publication of the Fauna of British India Series to India. Nelson Annandale.]</ref> The second edition is sometimes called the \"new fauna\". There were changes incorporated in this that included for instance the usage of trinomials for the birds. Following Shipley's death in 1927, Lieutenant Colonel [[John Stephenson (zoologist)|John Stephenson]], formerly of the Indian Medical Service was appointed editor in May 1928.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary.

T .Blanford (1832\u20131905)]]]]\nIn the volume on the mammals, Blanford notes:\n{{cquote|The need for new and revised descriptive works had, for some years before 1881, been felt and discussed amongst naturalists in India, but the attention of the Government was, I believe, first called to the matter by a memorial dated Sept. 15th of that year, prepared by Mr. P. L. Sclater, the well-known Secretary of the Zoological Society, signed by Mr. Charles Darwin, Sir J. Hooker, Professor Huxley, Sir J. Lubbock, Prof. W. H. Flower, and by Mr. Sclater himself, and presented to the Secretary of State for India. This memorial recommended the preparation of a series of Handbooks of Indian Zoology and my appointment as Editor. It is scarcely necessary to add that to the recommendation of men so highly respected and so well known in the world of Science the publication of the present ''Fauna of British India'' is greatly due, and that Mr. Sclater is entitled to the thanks of all interested in the Zoology of India for the important part he took in the transaction. I can only express a hope that the present series as a whole may be worthy of the distinguished support to which, in so great a degree, it owes its origin.}}\n\nThe idea was to cover initially the vertebrates, taking seven volumes, and this was followed by a proposal to cover the invertebrates in about 15 to 20 volumes and projected to cost \u00a311,250 to \u00a315,000. Blanford suggested that restricting it to 14 volumes would make it possible to limit the cost to \u00a310,500.<ref>[http://www.abhilekh-patal.in/jspui/handle/123456789/2727648 National Archive of India PR_000003044449 1890 - Proposal of Mr W.T.Blanford for the publication of a second series of the \"Fauna of British India\" No. 74. India Office, London 21st November 1889]</ref>  After Blanford's death, [[Arthur Shipley|Arthur Everett Shipley]] became the editor. The first series was followed by a second edition of some of the volumes such as the mammals, birds, reptiles and butterflies.  In 1922-23, [[Nelson Annandale]] sought to move the process of preparation of the books and its publication to India.<ref>[http://www.abhilekh-patal.in/jspui/handle/123456789/2738954 National Archives of India 1922 File:PR_000003005771 September 1922 Proposal to transfer the publication of the Fauna of British India Series to India. Nelson Annandale.]</ref> The second edition is sometimes called the \"new fauna\". There were changes incorporated in this that included for instance the usage of trinomials for the birds. Following Shipley's death in 1927, Lieutenant Colonel [[John Stephenson (zoologist)|John Stephenson]], formerly of the Indian Medical Service was appointed editor in May 1928.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Obituary.

It comprises thirteen treatises, each divided into chapters, and the first four treatises form an introduction to the whole work. In the first treatise, of eighteen chapters, Qirqisani gives a comprehensive survey of the development of [[Jewish religious movements]], the material for which he drew not only from the works of his predecessors, as David ibn Merwan al-Muqammash, whom he mentions, but also from his personal experiences in the learned circles in which he moved. The enumeration of the sects is given in chronological order, beginning with the [[Samaritans]], and concluding with the sect founded by [[Daniel al-Kumisi]]. Qirqisani declares the Rabbinites to be a Jewish sect founded by [[Jeroboam]], although it did not make its appearance until the time of the [[Second Temple]]. In opposition to them, [[Zadok]], a disciple of [[Antigonus of Sokho]] and founder of his own sect (either the [[Sadducees]] or [[Essenes|Zadokites]]) revealed part of the truth on religious subjects, while [[Anan ben David]] disclosed the whole. However, in spite of Qirqisani's admiration for Anan, he often disagrees with him in the explanation of the precepts.\n\n==View of Christianity==\nQirqisani includes Christianity among the Jewish sects. In the third treatise (ch. xvi.) he says that \"the religion of the Christians, as practised at present, has nothing in common with the teachings of [[Jesus]].\" According to Qirqisani, the Christianity of his day originated with [[Paul the Apostle]], who ascribed [[divinity]] to Jesus and [[prophet]]ic inspiration to himself. It was Paul that denied the necessity of carrying out the [[613 commandments]] and taught that religion consisted in humility; and the [[First Council of Nicaea]] adopted precepts which do not occur in the [[Torah|Law]], [[Gospel]]s, or [[Acts of the Apostles]].\n\n==Philosophy and Theology==\nQirqisani devotes a great portion of the first treatise to attacks upon the [[Rabbanites]], in which he does not show himself impartial; but he is not blind to the faults of the Karaites. In the last chapter he draws a sad picture of the spiritual condition of Karaism in his time. \"You can scarcely find two Karaites of one and the same opinion on all matters; upon almost any point each has an opinion different from those of all the rest.\" He deplores the neglect by the Karaites of the study of rabbinical literature, which, according to him, would furnish them with weapons for their controversies with the Rabbanites. Here Qirqisani is referring to the discrepancies frequent in haggadic and mystic literature, such as the \"Shi'ur Qomah,\" which, indeed, he often uses in his attacks against the Rabbanites.\n\nThe second treatise, of twenty-eight chapters, discusses the duty of applying critical methods to the study of religious matters. Qirqisani is the first Karaite known to have been a firm believer in the study of the sciences, and he criticizes those who, although accepting the fundamental principle of independent inquiry and research, are against the demonstrative sciences of [[dialectic]]s and philosophy. Reason is the foundation upon which every article of faith is based, and from which all knowledge flows. The third treatise, of twenty-three chapters, is a critical review of adverse religious sects and Christianity. In the seventeenth and eighteenth chapters Qirqisani refutes the doctrine of [[metempsychosis]], though among its exponents was Anan, who wrote a work on the subject. For Qirqisani, the solution of the question, much debated by the [[Mu\u02bftazila|Mu\u02bftazili]] ''[[kalam]]'', concerning the punishments inflicted upon children is not to be found in the doctrine of [[metempsychosis]], but in the belief that compensation will be given to children in the future world for their sufferings in this.\n\nIn the fourth treatise Qirqisani expounds, in sixty-eight chapters, the fundamental principles leading to the comprehension of the particular religious prescriptions. The remaining treatises are devoted to the precepts themselves, which are arranged in systematic order. Qirqisani quotes the views of the earliest Karaite authorities (as Anan, [[Benjamin Nahawandi]], Daniel al-Qumisi, etc.), which he often refutes.

The first treatise of the ''Kitab al-Anwar'', dealing with the Jewish sects, was published by [[Abraham Harkavy]] in the memoirs of the Oriental section of the Archeological Society (viii. 1849). Various fragments of seven treatises (ii.-vi., viii., ix.-xii.) are found in the [[British Museum]] (Oriental MSS. Nos. 2,524, 2,526, 2,578-2,582). They were analyzed by [[Samuel Abraham Pozna\u0144ski]], who published the text of chapters xvii. and xviii. of the third treatise, dealing with the doctrine of metempsychosis, and chapter xxxv. of the fifth treatise, in which Qirqisani discusses the question whether it is permitted to read on [[Shabbat]] books written in other than the [[Hebrew alphabet]] (Kohut Memorial Volume, pp.&nbsp;435\u2013462; ''Steinschneider Festschrift'', pp.&nbsp;195 et seq.). The text of the sixteenth chapter of the third treatise, dealing with the criticism of Christianity, was published by H. Hirschfeld in his chrestomathy. A dissertation on the [[Ten Commandments]] by Qirqisani, and which Steinschneider supposes to be the first chapter of the sixth treatise, beginning with proofs of the existence of God, is found in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale (No. 755). Both the ''Kitab al-Anwar'' and the ''Al-Riyad wal-Hada'iq'' were abridged, the former by a certain Moses ben Solomon ha-Levi. Harkavy deduces from quotations that Qirqisani translated the Bible into Arabic, wrote commentaries on the [[Book of Job]] and on [[Ecclesiastes]], and wrote a work on the [[monotheism|unity of God]](''Kitab al-[[Tawhid]]'').\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{JewishEncyclopedia|title=\u1e32IR\u1e32ISANI, ABU YUSUF YA'\u1e32UB|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=241&letter=K&search=Abu%20Yusuf%20Ya'%E1%B8%B3ub%20al-%E1%B8%B2ir%E1%B8%B3isani}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Qirqisani, Jacob}}\n[[Category:Karaite rabbis]]\n[[Category:10th-century rabbis]]\n[[Category:Circassians]]\n", "text_old": "'''''Jacob Qirqisani''''' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0628\u0648 \u06cc\u0648\u0633\u0641 \u06cc\u0639\u0642\u0648\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0642\u0633\u0627\u0646\u06cc}} ''\u02beAb\u016b Y\u016bsuf Ya\u02bfq\u016bb al-Qirqis\u0101n\u012b'', {{lang-he|\u05d9\u05e2\u05e7\u05d1 \u05d1\u05df \u05d9\u05e6\u05d7\u05e7 \u05d4\u05e7\u05e8\u05e7\u05e1\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9}} ''Ya\u02bfqov ben Yi\u1e63\u1e25aq ha\u1e62erqesi'') was a [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] [[dogma]]tist and [[exegesis|exegete]] who flourished in the first half of the tenth century.

The first treatise of the ''Kitab al-Anwar'', dealing with the Jewish sects, was published by [[Abraham Harkavy]] in the memoirs of the Oriental section of the Archeological Society (viii. 1849). Various fragments of seven treatises (ii.-vi., viii., ix.-xii.) are found in the [[British Museum]] (Oriental MSS. Nos. 2,524, 2,526, 2,578-2,582). They were analyzed by [[Samuel Abraham Pozna\u0144ski]], who published the text of chapters xvii. and xviii. of the third treatise, dealing with the doctrine of metempsychosis, and chapter xxxv. of the fifth treatise, in which Qirqisani discusses the question whether it is permitted to read on [[Shabbat]] books written in other than the [[Hebrew alphabet]] (Kohut Memorial Volume, pp.&nbsp;435\u2013462; ''Steinschneider Festschrift'', pp.&nbsp;195 et seq.). The text of the sixteenth chapter of the third treatise, dealing with the criticism of Christianity, was published by H. Hirschfeld in his chrestomathy. A dissertation on the [[Ten Commandments]] by Qirqisani, and which Steinschneider supposes to be the first chapter of the sixth treatise, beginning with proofs of the existence of God, is found in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale (No. 755). Both the ''Kitab al-Anwar'' and the ''Al-Riyad wal-Hada'iq'' were abridged, the former by a certain Moses ben Solomon ha-Levi. Harkavy deduces from quotations that Qirqisani translated the Bible into Arabic, wrote commentaries on the [[Book of Job]] and on [[Ecclesiastes]], and wrote a work on the [[monotheism|unity of God]](''Kitab al-[[Tawhid]]'').\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{JewishEncyclopedia|title=\u1e32IR\u1e32ISANI, ABU YUSUF YA'\u1e32UB|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=241&letter=K&search=Abu%20Yusuf%20Ya'%E1%B8%B3ub%20al-%E1%B8%B2ir%E1%B8%B3isani}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Qirqisani, Jacob}}\n[[Category:Karaite rabbis]]\n[[Category:10th-century rabbis]]\n[[Category:Circassians]]\n", "name_user": "Mossyflowers", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Qirqisani"}

The burning sensation is caused by the nicotine itself (similar to the tingle of nicotine gum) and some food additives such as [[sodium carbonate]] (E500).  Sodium carbonate is a food additive used to increase the pH of the tobacco (reduce the acidity).  This increases the [[bioavailability]] of the nicotine, meaning more is available for absorption.  Some flavorings (mints in particular) are astringent and may increase the tingling or burning sensation.\n\n==Confusion of snus and snuff==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Camel Snus Winterchill tin.jpg|thumb|A tin of American snus (Camel Snus brand)]] -->\n\nSnus, dry snuff, and dipping tobacco are distinct products that English speaking people often call ''snuff'' but are processed and used in very different ways, each with their own sets of risks.\n\nThe English word \"snuff\" is translated to ''{{lang|se|snus}}'' in Swedish.  Often, the word \"snuff\" is used to refer to the nasal form of tobacco (nasal snuff).  The same is true of American dipping tobacco which is known in America simply as ''snuff'' {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.  In Sweden, nasal snuff is referred to as ''{{lang|se|torrsnus}}'' or ''{{lang|se|luktsnus}}''.

It is [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflated]] \u2013 \"sniffed\" but not deeply \"snorted\" \u2013 through the nose.  It is often [[menthol]]ated or otherwise scented.\n*'''[[Chewing tobacco]]''' (North American, European), also known as chew (or in some Southern US dialects as ''chaw''), is tobacco in the form of short or long, loose leaf and stem strands (like [[pipe tobacco]] or longer), or less commonly of chopped leaves and stems compressed into blocks called plugs, or even finely ground pieces compressed into pellets. A few brands are cut into much finer loose strands, like [[Shag (tobacco)|cigarette rolling tobacco]]. Chew is placed between the cheek and the gums, or actively chewed.  It causes copious salivation, especially when chewed, and due to its irritant (even [[nausea]]ting) effect on the [[esophagus]], this \"juice\" usually requires spitting. Chewing tobacco is a long-established North American form of tobacco (derived from traditional use of raw tobacco leaf by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]), and is also legal in the European Union.  Chewing tobacco is sometimes flavored, e.g. with wintergreen, [[apple]], or cherry.\n*'''[[Dipping tobacco]]''' (North American), also known as dip, spit tobacco or, ambiguously, as moist snuff, is a common American form of tobacco (also available in Canada and Mexico). It is moist, and somewhat finely ground, but less so than snus. Dipping tobacco (so called because users dip their fingers into the package to pinch a portion to insert into the mouth) is placed between the lower lip or cheek and the gums; it is not used nasally. As with chewing tobacco, salivation is copious, and usually spat out.  Dipping tobacco is usually flavored, traditionally with wintergreen or mint, though many other flavorings are now available, while some unflavored brands remain popular.  Beginning in the mid 1980s, several brands have packaged American dipping tobacco in porous pouches like those used for many brands of Scandinavian and American snus. \n*'''''Makla''''' (Belgian and African) is a moist tobacco similar to Scandinavian snus in many respects. It is placed in the upper lip in a manner similar to snus; it differs in that it is more finely ground and has an even higher nicotine content and pH level. Sales within the European Union are legal due to its classification as a chewing tobacco. Its safety in comparison to snus has not been studied sufficiently.\n*'''''[[Naswar]]''''' (Central Asian) is a moist, powdered form of tobacco, often green and sometimes caked with the mineral [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and/or wood ash.

The end result is often referred to as a ''pris'' (pinch), ''buga, prilla'', or ''prell'' (slang).  Some users (usually long-time users) simply pinch the tobacco and place it under their upper lip (farmer's pinch or living snus). Over time, the demand for loose snus has been replaced by portioned varieties.  Many users of snus today prefer the discrete nature of the latter variety.\n*'''Portion snus''' is prepackaged moist powder in small teabag-like sachets. It comes in smaller quantities than the loose powder, but is considered more convenient and discreet than loose snus. The two varieties of portion snus are:\n** Original portion, introduced in 1973, is the traditional form. The sachet material is moisturized during the manufacturing process, resulting in a brown, moist pouch.\n** White portion is a milder-tasting and slightly slower-release form. The sachet material is not moisturized during the manufacturing process, resulting in a white, dry pouch. The tobacco within the portion material has the same moisture content as original portion snus, but the nicotine and flavor are somewhat slower in delivery due to the drier sachet. \"White portion\" refers to the style, not the color, as many white portion snus use a black material instead of white, yet are \"white portion\".

The weights may vary, but the labelling on most packages of snus disclose their net weight. Mini portions typically weigh close to 0.5 g, normal (large) portions weigh around .8 to 1 gram, and maxi portions weigh up to 1.7 g, depending on brand. Some brands also offer the choice of \"regular\" and \"long\" versions of the normal size sachet, which are similar in content weight. These long portions differ from traditional sachets in that they are slimmer but longer, in order to fit against the gums more comfortably.\n\nThe nicotine content of snus varies among brands, with the most common strength being 8&nbsp;mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco. In recent years, snus manufacturers have released stark (strong or ''sterk'') and extra stark (extra strong or extra ''sterk'') varieties with greater nicotine content. Stark varieties contain, on average, 11&nbsp;mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco, while extra stark varieties may contain up to 22&nbsp;mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco. Recently, the Siberia brand released its \"Extremely Strong\" snus which boasts 45&nbsp;mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco and is currently the highest nicotine-per-gram snus available.\n\n==Contents==\nSwedish snus is made from air-dried tobacco from various parts of the world. In earlier times, tobacco for making snus was laid out for drying in [[Scania]] and [[M\u00e4lardalen]], Sweden. Later, [[Kentucky]] tobaccos were used. The ground tobacco is mixed with water, salt, an alkalizing agent (today this is sodium carbonate), and aroma, and is prepared through heating. After the heating process, food grade aromas are typically added. In Sweden, snus is regulated as a food product and, for this reason, all ingredients are listed on the label of each individual package (can) of snus. Moist snus contains more than 50% water, and the average use of snus in Sweden is approximately 800&nbsp;grams (16 units) per person each year.

Although steam-pasteurization is remarkably complex, it has the advantages of inhibiting the growth of bacteria that facilitate the formation of tobacco-specific [[nitrosamine]]s, while preserving the desired texture and mouthfeel of the snus. The absorption of nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco, from snus depends on the level of nicotine in the snus and the pH level in the box.<ref>Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, SCENIHR.

It is illegal in the rest of the European Union. It is sold in small tins which, in the earlier years, were made of [[porcelain]], wood, silver, or gold.  Portioned snus usually comes in plastic tins of 24 portions, containing about .75 to 1 gram of snus each, while loose snus is mostly sold in wax coated cardboard containers with plastic lids (similar to dip snuff), at 42 g (50 g before 2008). Mini-portion and medium-portion snus are increasingly popular formats. Most of these products come in tins containing 20 portions, of either 0.65 or 0.5&nbsp;grams each for a total of just under 13 or 10&nbsp;grams, particularly with those for whom concealing their use of smokeless tobacco in places is of utmost importance.\n\n==Industry==\nAlthough Swedish snus was previously{{when|date=January 2013}} only available by mail order in the US, an increasing number of tobacco retailers have now begun to stock it.

The considerably different, sweetened American snus is more commonly found at convenience stores, in multiple brands produced by US-based cigarette companies. Neither product category has made much of an inroad into the market-share held by the [[dipping tobacco]] products more common in that country.\n\n===Debate among public health researchers===\nThere is some debate among [[public health]] researchers over the use of \"safer\" tobacco or nicotine delivery systems, generally dividing along two lines of thought. Some (primarily in the European Union and Canada) believe in \"[[tobacco harm reduction]]\", with the general belief that while it should remain a goal to reduce addiction to nicotine in the population as a whole, the reduction of harm to the health of those who choose to use nicotine is more pragmatic than the desire to reduce overall nicotine addiction. In other words, people using more harmful forms of tobacco (e.g., cigarettes) should be encouraged to switch to less harmful products (e.g., snus). The other school of thought is that no tobacco product should be promoted, and that attention should be placed instead on getting users to switch to nicotine replacement therapy or quit altogether.\n\nOne proponent of using snus for harm reduction is Karl Fagerstr\u00f6m, a PhD in psychology regarded{{By whom|date=January 2018}} as a leading researcher in [[smoking cessation]] in Sweden.  Some research available today shows snus use reduces or eliminates the risk of cancers associated with the use of other tobacco products, such as [[chewing tobacco]] (the type primarily used in the US and Canada, created in a process similar to cigarette tobacco) and cigarettes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tobaccoprogram.org/pdf/TC12349.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714043602/http://www.tobaccoprogram.org/pdf/TC12349.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-14 }}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> The widespread use of snus by Swedish men (estimated at 30% of Swedish male ex-smokers), displacing tobacco smoking and other varieties of snuff, is thought to be responsible for the incidence of tobacco-related mortality in men being significantly lower in Sweden than any other European country.

MAO inhibitors in tobacco act to amplify the rewarding effects of nicotine, but may also act as a form of self-medication for people with depression. This could explain the association between mental illness and smoking, but a confounding variable is that chronic nicotine administration itself has been shown to desensitize nicotine receptors overtime and lead to antidepressant effects.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2010.09.004|pmid=20965579|title=Nicotine receptors and depression: Revisiting and revising the cholinergic hypothesis|journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences|volume=31|issue=12|pages=580\u20136|year=2010|last1=Mineur|first1=Yann S.|last2=Picciotto|first2=Marina R.|pmc=2991594}}</ref> Smoking cessation itself is strongly associated with reduced depression, anxiety, and stress and improved positive mood and quality of life compared with continuing to smoke.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.g1151 |pmid=24524926 |pmc=3923980 |title=Change in mental health after smoking cessation: Systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=348 |pages=g1151 |year=2014 |last1=Taylor |first1=G. |last2=McNeill |first2=A. |last3=Girling |first3=A. |last4=Farley |first4=A. |last5=Lindson-Hawley |first5=N. |last6=Aveyard |first6=P. }}</ref> It has been hypothesized that snus' success when compared with conventional NRT as a cigarette substitute could be attributed to its MAO inhibiting properties. However, studies seem to suggest that for MAO inhibition, tobacco has to be pyrolysized (i.e., ignited as in cigarettes, cigars, and pipes). The competing theory is that the success of snus as a smoking alternative is due to its ability to deliver nicotine similar to that acquired through cigarettes, and twice as high as that acquired through NRT.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/tc.12.4.349 |pmid=14660766 |pmc=1747791 |title=Effect of smokeless tobacco (snus) on smoking and public health in Sweden |journal=Tobacco Control |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=349\u201359 |year=2003 |last1=Foulds |first1=J |last2=Ramstrom |first2=L |last3=Burke |first3=M |last4=Fagerstr\u00f6m |first4=K }}</ref> Furthermore, the use of snus, similar to cigarettes, offers a choice of brand, aesthetic rituals of use, and tastes of tobacco and thus has sensory effects that NRT products perhaps lack.

This is seen by public health advocates who believe in \"harm reduction\" as a reason for recommending snus, as well as other NRTs, rather than continued use of methods of tobacco consumption that result in second-hand smoke.\n\nThis does not, however, eliminate any harm to health caused by the nicotine itself. Current research focuses on possible long-term side effects of nicotine on [[blood pressure]], hypertension, and possible risk of pancreatic cancer due to [[tobacco-specific nitrosamines]] (TSNAs).

When she became a regular user of snuff, it became a fashion among the court and upper-class citizens of France, especially among females, as it was deemed more socially acceptable than other forms of tobacco.\n\nThis trend of using snuff in the nose also spread to Sweden at the beginning of the 17th century. In the 18th century, Swedish producers began to manufacture moist snuff, which was placed in the lower lip and did not require spitting. It became known as snus. [[Ettan snus|Ettan]] (meaning \"the number one\"), registered since 1822, is the oldest brand of snus still sold.\n\nIt is a popular myth that snus or any other forms of smokeless tobacco contains fiberglass, or glass particles, as an aid to the absorption of nicotine by the user's blood. This is not true.<ref name=healtheffectsofst>{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Carl V.|title=Smokeless tobacco and your health|url=http://www.tobaccoharmreduction.org/faq/healtheffectsofst.htm|accessdate=29 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826220217/http://www.tobaccoharmreduction.org/faq/healtheffectsofst.htm|archive-date=26 August 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Mucous membranes]] readily absorb free nicotine. The burning sensation is caused by the nicotine itself (similar to the tingle of nicotine gum) and some food additives such as [[sodium carbonate]] (E500).  Sodium carbonate is a food additive used to increase the pH of the tobacco (reduce the acidity).  This increases the [[bioavailability]] of the nicotine, meaning more is available for absorption.  Some flavorings (mints in particular) are astringent and may increase the tingling or burning sensation.\n\n==Confusion of snus and snuff==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Camel Snus Winterchill tin.jpg|thumb|A tin of American snus (Camel Snus brand)]] -->\n\nSnus, dry snuff, and dipping tobacco are distinct products that English speaking people often call ''snuff'' but are processed and used in very different ways, each with their own sets of risks.\n\nThe English word \"snuff\" is translated to ''{{lang|se|snus}}'' in Swedish.  Often, the word \"snuff\" is used to refer to the nasal form of tobacco (nasal snuff).  The same is true of American dipping tobacco which is known in America simply as ''snuff'' {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.  In Sweden, nasal snuff is referred to as ''{{lang|se|torrsnus}}'' or ''{{lang|se|luktsnus}}''. Outside of the US, cured moist snuff that is applied to the lower lip, and that requires spitting (American: snuff), is simply called American dipping tobacco.\n\n==Differences between snus and similar tobacco products==\n{{anchor|Difference between dip, chew, naswar, and snus|reason=Old section name, may be linked.}}\n{{see also|Smokeless tobacco}}\nSome forms of tobacco consumed in the mouth may be categorized as:\n*'''Swedish snus''' is a moist form of smokeless tobacco which is usually placed under the upper lip, and which does not result in the need for spitting.  It is sold either as a moist powder known as loose snus, or prepackaged into pouches known as portion snus. Snus is often mildly flavored with food-grade smoke aroma, [[Bergamot essential oil|bergamot]], [[citrus]], juniper berry, [[herb]]s and/or floral flavors.  Most Scandinavian snus is produced in Sweden and regulated as food under the [[Swedish Food Act]].<ref name=\"swedishfood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/tobacco/framework/public_hearings/swedish_match_ab.pdf|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=20 October 2014|title=Snus \u2013 The Swedish Experience|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106132514/http://www.who.int/tobacco/framework/public_hearings/swedish_match_ab.pdf|archive-date=6 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*'''American snus''', available since the late 1990s, is similar to the Scandinavian form, but usually has a lower moisture content and lower pH, resulting in lower [[bioavailability]] of nicotine than Scandinavian varieties, meaning less is available for absorption.<ref name=\"snuscomparison\"/>  American snus is often flavored, e.g. with [[spearmint]], [[wintergreen]], [[vanilla]] or fruit (e.g. [[cherry]]), and may contain sugar.\n*'''[[Nasal snuff]]''' (mostly English, German, and Scandinavian), referred to as ''luktsnus'' in Swedish and ''luktesnus'' in Norwegian, and as \"Scotch snuff\" {{citation needed|date=November 2019}} in the US, is a dry, powdered form of snuff. It is [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflated]] \u2013 \"sniffed\" but not deeply \"snorted\" \u2013 through the nose.  It is often [[menthol]]ated or otherwise scented.\n*'''[[Chewing tobacco]]''' (North American, European), also known as chew (or in some Southern US dialects as ''chaw''), is tobacco in the form of short or long, loose leaf and stem strands (like [[pipe tobacco]] or longer), or less commonly of chopped leaves and stems compressed into blocks called plugs, or even finely ground pieces compressed into pellets. A few brands are cut into much finer loose strands, like [[Shag (tobacco)|cigarette rolling tobacco]]. Chew is placed between the cheek and the gums, or actively chewed.  It causes copious salivation, especially when chewed, and due to its irritant (even [[nausea]]ting) effect on the [[esophagus]], this \"juice\" usually requires spitting. Chewing tobacco is a long-established North American form of tobacco (derived from traditional use of raw tobacco leaf by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]]), and is also legal in the European Union.  Chewing tobacco is sometimes flavored, e.g. with wintergreen, [[apple]], or cherry.\n*'''[[Dipping tobacco]]''' (North American), also known as dip, spit tobacco or, ambiguously, as moist snuff, is a common American form of tobacco (also available in Canada and Mexico). It is moist, and somewhat finely ground, but less so than snus. Dipping tobacco (so called because users dip their fingers into the package to pinch a portion to insert into the mouth) is placed between the lower lip or cheek and the gums; it is not used nasally. As with chewing tobacco, salivation is copious, and usually spat out.  Dipping tobacco is usually flavored, traditionally with wintergreen or mint, though many other flavorings are now available, while some unflavored brands remain popular.  Beginning in the mid 1980s, several brands have packaged American dipping tobacco in porous pouches like those used for many brands of Scandinavian and American snus. \n*'''''Makla''''' (Belgian and African) is a moist tobacco similar to Scandinavian snus in many respects. It is placed in the upper lip in a manner similar to snus; it differs in that it is more finely ground and has an even higher nicotine content and pH level. Sales within the European Union are legal due to its classification as a chewing tobacco. Its safety in comparison to snus has not been studied sufficiently.\n*'''''[[Naswar]]''''' (Central Asian) is a moist, powdered form of tobacco, often green and sometimes caked with the mineral [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] and/or wood ash. It is used like dipping tobacco or put under the tongue, and is pungent and often heavily flavored, e.g. with culinary oils ([[cardamom]], [[sesame]]), the fruit [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], menthol, etc.\n\n==Types==\n[[Image:Skruf snus pris.JPG|thumb|Cylindrical (fingertips) ''pris'' of Swedish brand [[Skruf Snus|Skruf]]]]\n[[File:Snus-portion-types.jpg|thumb|Left is an original (or \"regular\") portion. Right is a \"white portion\". White portions can be any color, as the name refers to the style, not the color.]]\nMany types of snus are available:\n*'''Loose snus''' is a moist powder which can be portioned and packed into a cylindrical or spherical shape with the fingertips or a purpose-made cylindrical device. The end result is often referred to as a ''pris'' (pinch), ''buga, prilla'', or ''prell'' (slang).  Some users (usually long-time users) simply pinch the tobacco and place it under their upper lip (farmer's pinch or living snus). Over time, the demand for loose snus has been replaced by portioned varieties.  Many users of snus today prefer the discrete nature of the latter variety.\n*'''Portion snus''' is prepackaged moist powder in small teabag-like sachets. It comes in smaller quantities than the loose powder, but is considered more convenient and discreet than loose snus. The two varieties of portion snus are:\n** Original portion, introduced in 1973, is the traditional form. The sachet material is moisturized during the manufacturing process, resulting in a brown, moist pouch.\n** White portion is a milder-tasting and slightly slower-release form. The sachet material is not moisturized during the manufacturing process, resulting in a white, dry pouch. The tobacco within the portion material has the same moisture content as original portion snus, but the nicotine and flavor are somewhat slower in delivery due to the drier sachet. \"White portion\" refers to the style, not the color, as many white portion snus use a black material instead of white, yet are \"white portion\".  Examples include General Onyx and Grovsnus Svart (Black) and Blue Ocean (Blue).\n** Sting-free portion is a patent-approved <ref>{{cite web|url=https://was.prv.se/spd/patent?lang=en&hits=true&hitsstart=0&tab=1&content=b-o+wiberg+solutions+ab&p2=pSjrLA5TwfY&p1=icoGA1tZM8x7eM42P9NdVA&start=0|title=Swedish Patent Database, Patent SE 1450234-8, SE 539029|website=was.PRV.se|access-date=2 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002153343/https://was.prv.se/spd/patent?lang=en&hits=true&hitsstart=0&tab=1&content=b-o+wiberg+solutions+ab&p2=pSjrLA5TwfY&p1=icoGA1tZM8x7eM42P9NdVA&start=0|archive-date=2 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> snus pouch, introducing a protective side, that reduces the stinging sensation and irritation to the snus users gum and oral mucous membrane.

The weights may vary, but the labelling on most packages of snus disclose their net weight. Mini portions typically weigh close to 0.5 g, normal (large) portions weigh around .8 to 1 gram, and maxi portions weigh up to 1.7 g, depending on brand. Some brands also offer the choice of \"regular\" and \"long\" versions of the normal size sachet, which are similar in content weight. These long portions differ from traditional sachets in that they are slimmer but longer, in order to fit against the gums more comfortably.\n\nThe nicotine content of snus varies among brands, with the most common strength being 8&nbsp;mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco. In recent years, snus manufacturers have released stark (strong or ''sterk'') and extra stark (extra strong or extra ''sterk'') varieties with greater nicotine content. Stark varieties contain, on average, 11&nbsp;mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco, while extra stark varieties may contain up to 22&nbsp;mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco. Recently, the Siberia brand released its \"Extremely Strong\" snus which boasts 45&nbsp;mg of nicotine per gram of tobacco and is currently the highest nicotine-per-gram snus available.\n\n==Contents==\nSwedish snus is made from air-dried tobacco from various parts of the world. In earlier times, tobacco for making snus was laid out for drying in [[Scania]] and [[M\u00e4lardalen]], Sweden. Later, [[Kentucky]] tobaccos were used. The ground tobacco is mixed with water, salt, an alkalizing agent (today this is sodium carbonate), and aroma, and is prepared through heating. After the heating process, food grade aromas are typically added. In Sweden, snus is regulated as a food product and, for this reason, all ingredients are listed on the label of each individual package (can) of snus. Moist snus contains more than 50% water, and the average use of snus in Sweden is approximately 800&nbsp;grams (16 units) per person each year. About 12% (1.1 million people) of the population in Sweden use snus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaksfakta.org/Default.aspx?id=3436|title=Sidan finns inte - Tobaksfakta|publisher=|access-date=2007-08-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927073217/http://www.tobaksfakta.org/Default.aspx?id=3436|archive-date=2007-09-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Unlike dipping tobacco and chew, most snus today does not undergo the [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] process, but is instead steam-[[Pasteurization|pasteurized]]. Although steam-pasteurization is remarkably complex, it has the advantages of inhibiting the growth of bacteria that facilitate the formation of tobacco-specific [[nitrosamine]]s, while preserving the desired texture and mouthfeel of the snus. The absorption of nicotine, the addictive substance in tobacco, from snus depends on the level of nicotine in the snus and the pH level in the box.<ref>Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks, SCENIHR. Health Effects of Smokeless Tobacco Products. 2008:78-79</ref> A voluntary quality standard for snus products has been introduced (Gothiatek) that sets maximum levels for certain controversial constituents including nitrosamines, heavy metals, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Most manufacturers of Scandinavian type snus adhere to this standard.\n\nSnus is sold primarily in Sweden, [[Faroe Islands]] and Norway, and has more recently been introduced to South Africa and the U.S. It can be found in places frequented by Scandinavian tourists, such as [[Murmansk]] in Russia or [[Chania]] in Greece.  It is illegal in the rest of the European Union. It is sold in small tins which, in the earlier years, were made of [[porcelain]], wood, silver, or gold.  Portioned snus usually comes in plastic tins of 24 portions, containing about .75 to 1 gram of snus each, while loose snus is mostly sold in wax coated cardboard containers with plastic lids (similar to dip snuff), at 42 g (50 g before 2008). Mini-portion and medium-portion snus are increasingly popular formats. Most of these products come in tins containing 20 portions, of either 0.65 or 0.5&nbsp;grams each for a total of just under 13 or 10&nbsp;grams, particularly with those for whom concealing their use of smokeless tobacco in places is of utmost importance.\n\n==Industry==\nAlthough Swedish snus was previously{{when|date=January 2013}} only available by mail order in the US, an increasing number of tobacco retailers have now begun to stock it. [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], [[Philip Morris USA]], and [[U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company]] now produce similar products called [[Camel (cigarette)#Snus|Camel Snus]], [[Marlboro (cigarette)#American snus varieties|Marlboro snus]], and [[Skoal (tobacco)#Cuts and Flavors|Skoal snus]], respectively.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} While American snus is packaged in much the same way (moist tobacco in a small pouch), production methods vary considerably from traditional Swedish methods.

The report also concluded that there is no increased risk of COPD or lung cancer.<ref name=NHE201411>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311887/Ecigarettes_report.pdf|title=Electronic cigarettes \u2013 A report commissioned by Public Health England|publisher=Public Health England|date=15 May 2014|page=11|author1-first=John|author1-last=Britton|author2-first=Ilze|author2-last=Bogdanovica|access-date=24 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010172919/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/311887/Ecigarettes_report.pdf|archive-date=10 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nSnus manufacturer Swedish Match filed a [[modified risk tobacco product]] (MRTP) application with the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products to modify the warning label requirements by:<ref name=\"SM MRTP\">{{cite web | url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/Static/widgets/tobacco/SMNA_MRTPA_FDA-2014-N-1051.html | title=Swedish Match North America MRTP Applications | date=27 August 2014 | accessdate=24 October 2014 | pages=100,000+ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019020323/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/Static/widgets/tobacco/SMNA_MRTPA_FDA-2014-N-1051.html | archive-date=19 October 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n# removing the current warnings, \"This product can cause mouth cancer\" and \"This product can cause gum disease and tooth loss.\"\n# replacing the current warning, \"This product is not a safe alternative to cigarettes,\u201d with \u201cNo tobacco product is safe, but this product presents substantially lower risks to health than cigarettes.\"\n# retaining the current warning, \"Smokeless tobacco is addictive.\"\n\nThe FDA's Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee voted against the request in April 2015 but Swedish Match is continuing their efforts for this change.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cspnet.com/category-news/tobacco/articles/modified-risk-down-not-out|title=Modified Risk: Down But Not Out|publisher=|access-date=2016-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203210307/http://www.cspnet.com/category-news/tobacco/articles/modified-risk-down-not-out|archive-date=2016-02-03|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[R.

The considerably different, sweetened American snus is more commonly found at convenience stores, in multiple brands produced by US-based cigarette companies. Neither product category has made much of an inroad into the market-share held by the [[dipping tobacco]] products more common in that country.\n\n===Debate among public health researchers===\nThere is some debate among [[public health]] researchers over the use of \"safer\" tobacco or nicotine delivery systems, generally dividing along two lines of thought. Some (primarily in the European Union and Canada) believe in \"[[tobacco harm reduction]]\", with the general belief that while it should remain a goal to reduce addiction to nicotine in the population as a whole, the reduction of harm to the health of those who choose to use nicotine is more pragmatic than the desire to reduce overall nicotine addiction. In other words, people using more harmful forms of tobacco (e.g., cigarettes) should be encouraged to switch to less harmful products (e.g., snus). The other school of thought is that no tobacco product should be promoted, and that attention should be placed instead on getting users to switch to nicotine replacement therapy or quit altogether.\n\nOne proponent of using snus for harm reduction is Karl Fagerstr\u00f6m, a PhD in psychology regarded{{By whom|date=January 2018}} as a leading researcher in [[smoking cessation]] in Sweden.  Some research available today shows snus use reduces or eliminates the risk of cancers associated with the use of other tobacco products, such as [[chewing tobacco]] (the type primarily used in the US and Canada, created in a process similar to cigarette tobacco) and cigarettes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tobaccoprogram.org/pdf/TC12349.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060714043602/http://www.tobaccoprogram.org/pdf/TC12349.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-14 }}{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref> The widespread use of snus by Swedish men (estimated at 30% of Swedish male ex-smokers), displacing tobacco smoking and other varieties of snuff, is thought to be responsible for the incidence of tobacco-related mortality in men being significantly lower in Sweden than any other European country. In contrast, since women traditionally are less likely to use snus, their rate of tobacco-related deaths in Sweden can be compared to that of other European countries.\n\nSnus may be less harmful than other tobacco products (see above).  According to Kenneth Warner, director of the University of Michigan Tobacco Research Network, \"The Swedish government has studied this stuff to death and, to date, there is no compelling evidence that it has any adverse health consequences. \u2026 Whatever they eventually find out, it is dramatically less dangerous than smoking.\"<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Corporate Social Responsibility As A Tactic Used By Big Tobacco |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHdZw2zOuzoC&pg=PA375 |pages=375\u20139 |title=Ending the Tobacco Holocaust |isbn=978-1-60070-019-4 |last1=Rabinoff |first1=Michael |year=2007}}</ref>\n\nA 2014 report commissioned by [[Public Health England]] on another avenue for tobacco harm reduction, [[electronic cigarette]]s, examined the case of snus as \"a unique natural experiment in the impact of a socially accepted, non-medical, affordable and easily accessible reduced harm product on the prevalence of tobacco smoking\".  They concluded that \"Although controversial, the Swedish natural experiment demonstrates that despite dual use and primary uptake of the reduced-harm product by young people, availability of reduced-harm alternatives for tobacco smokers can have a beneficial effect.

MAO inhibitors in tobacco act to amplify the rewarding effects of nicotine, but may also act as a form of self-medication for people with depression. This could explain the association between mental illness and smoking, but a confounding variable is that chronic nicotine administration itself has been shown to desensitize nicotine receptors overtime and lead to antidepressant effects.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tips.2010.09.004|pmid=20965579|title=Nicotine receptors and depression: Revisiting and revising the cholinergic hypothesis|journal=Trends in Pharmacological Sciences|volume=31|issue=12|pages=580\u20136|year=2010|last1=Mineur|first1=Yann S.|last2=Picciotto|first2=Marina R.|pmc=2991594}}</ref> Smoking cessation itself is strongly associated with reduced depression, anxiety, and stress and improved positive mood and quality of life compared with continuing to smoke.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.g1151 |pmid=24524926 |pmc=3923980 |title=Change in mental health after smoking cessation: Systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=BMJ |volume=348 |pages=g1151 |year=2014 |last1=Taylor |first1=G. |last2=McNeill |first2=A. |last3=Girling |first3=A. |last4=Farley |first4=A. |last5=Lindson-Hawley |first5=N. |last6=Aveyard |first6=P. }}</ref> It has been hypothesized that snus' success when compared with conventional NRT as a cigarette substitute could be attributed to its MAO inhibiting properties.

The 24-day march lasted from 12 March 1930 to 6 April 1930 as a [[direct action]] campaign of [[tax resistance]] and [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent protest]] against the [[History of the British salt tax in India|British salt monopoly]]. Another reason for this march was that the Civil Disobedience Movement needed a strong inauguration that would inspire more people to follow Gandhi's example. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] started this march with 80 of his trusted volunteers.<ref name=\"NSS\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dandimemorial.in/pdf/List-of-1930-Salt-Marchers.pdf|title=National Salt Satyagraha Memorial {{!}} List of names|website=www.dandimemorial.in|access-date=11 August 2019}}</ref> Walking ten miles a day for 24 days, the march spanned over 240 miles (384&nbsp;km), from [[Sabarmati Ashram]] to [[Dandi, Navsari|Dandi]], which was called [[Navsari]] at that time (now in the state of Gujarat). Growing numbers of Indians joined them along the way. When Gandhi broke the salt laws at 6:30&nbsp;am on 6 April 1930, it sparked large scale acts of civil disobedience against the [[British Raj]] [[history of the British salt tax in India|salt laws]] by millions of Indians.<ref>\"Mass civil disobedience throughout India followed as millions broke the salt laws\", from Dalton's introduction to Gandhi's ''Civil Disobedience'', [[#GandhiDalton|Gandhi and Dalton]], p. 72.</ref>\n\nAfter making the salt by evaporation at Dandi, Gandhi continued southward along the coast, making salt and addressing meetings on the way. The Congress Party planned to stage a satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works, 25 miles south of Dandi. However, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4\u20135 May 1930, just days before the planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the ensuing [[Dharasana Satyagraha]] drew worldwide attention to the [[Indian independence movement]] through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. The [[satyagraha]] against the salt tax continued for almost a year, ending with Gandhi's release from jail and negotiations with [[Viceroy]] [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]] at the Second [[Round Table Conference]].<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 92.</ref> Although over 60,000 Indians were jailed as a result of the Salt Satyagraha, <ref>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 234.</ref> the British did not make immediate major concessions. <ref>[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe Salt Satyagraha campaign was based upon Gandhi's principles of non-violent protest called ''[[satyagraha]]'', which he loosely translated as \"truth-force\".<ref>\"Its root meaning is holding onto truth, hence truth-force. I have also called it Love-force or Soul-force.\" Gandhi (2001), p. 6.</ref> Literally, it is formed from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''satya'', \"truth\", and ''agraha'', \"insistence\".  In early 1930 the Indian National Congress chose satyagraha as their main tactic for winning Indian sovereignty and self-rule from British rule and appointed Gandhi to organise the campaign. Gandhi chose the 1882 British Salt Act as the first target of satyagraha. The Salt March to Dandi, and the beating by British police of hundreds of nonviolent protesters in Dharasana, which received worldwide news coverage, demonstrated the effective use of civil disobedience as a technique for fighting social and political injustice.<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 35.</ref> The satyagraha teachings of Gandhi and the March to Dandi had a significant influence on American activists [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[James Bevel]], and others during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] for civil rights for African Americans and other minority groups in the 1960s.<ref name=\"King, p. 23\"/> The march was the most significant organised challenge to British authority since the [[Non-cooperation movement]] of 1920\u201322, and directly followed the [[Purna Swaraj]] declaration of sovereignty and self-rule by the [[Indian National Congress]] on 26 January 1930.<ref>{{cite book|title=Eyewitness Gandhi|date=2014|publisher=Dorling Kinderseley Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0241185667|page=44|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hY3WAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=dharasana+navsari#v=onepage&q=dharasana%20navsari&f=false|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> It gained worldwide attention which gave impetus to the [[Indian independence movement]] and started the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement.\n\n== Declaration of sovereignty and self-rule ==\n{{main|Purna Swaraj}}\n[[File:Mahatma & Sarojini Naidu 1930.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Sarojini Naidu]] during the March.]]\nAt midnight on 31 December 1929, the [[Indian National Congress]] raised the tricolour [[flag of India]] on the banks of the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] at [[Lahore]].

The declaration included the readiness to withhold taxes, and the statement:\n\n<blockquote>We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain ''Purna Swaraji'' or complete sovereignty and self-rule.<ref name=Wolpert1999/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Congress Working Committee]] gave Gandhi the responsibility for organising the first act of [[civil disobedience]], with Congress itself ready to take charge after Gandhi's expected arrest.<ref name=\"A & DuVall, p. 83\">[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 83.</ref> Gandhi's plan was to begin civil disobedience with a satyagraha aimed at the [[History of the British salt tax in India|British salt tax]]. The 1882 Salt Act gave the British a monopoly on the collection and manufacture of salt, limiting its handling to government salt depots and levying a salt tax.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 91.</ref> Violation of the Salt Act was a criminal offence. Even though salt was freely available to those living on the coast (by evaporation of sea water), Indians were forced to buy it from the colonial government.\n\n==Choice of salt as protest focus==\nInitially, Gandhi's choice of the salt tax was met with incredulity by the Working Committee of the Congress,<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 100.</ref> [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and Dibyalochan Sahoo were ambivalent; [[Sardar Patel]] suggested a land revenue boycott instead.<ref>\"Nehru, who had been skeptical about salt as the primary focus of the campaign, realized how wrong he was&nbsp;...\" [[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 32.</ref><ref name=\"gopalgandhi\">Gandhi, Gopalkrishna.

The [[Viceroy]] himself, [[Lord Irwin]], did not take the threat of a salt protest seriously, writing to London, \"At present the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night.\"<ref>Letter to London on 20 February 1930. [[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 84.</ref>\n\nHowever, Gandhi had sound reasons for his decision. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|page=64}}</ref> The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.<ref name=\"Gandhi & Dalton, 1996, p. 72\">[[#GandhiDalton|Gandhi and Dalton]], p. 72.</ref>\nExplaining his choice, Gandhi said, \"Next to air and water, salt is perhaps the greatest necessity of life.\" In contrast to the other leaders, the prominent Congress statesman and future [[Governor-General of India]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], understood Gandhi's viewpoint. In a public meeting at [[Tuticorin]], he said:\n\n<blockquote>Suppose, a people rise in revolt. They cannot attack the abstract constitution or lead an army against proclamations and statutes&nbsp;... Civil disobedience has to be directed against the salt tax or the land tax or some other particular point&nbsp;\u2013 not that; that is our final end, but for the time being it is our aim, and we must shoot straight.<ref name=\"gopalgandhi\" /></blockquote>\n\nGandhi felt that this protest would dramatise Purna Swaraj in a way that was meaningful to every Indian. He also reasoned that it would build unity between Hindus and Muslims by fighting a wrong that touched them equally.<ref name=\"A & DuVall, p. 83\" />\n\nAfter the protest gathered steam, the leaders realised the power of salt as a symbol. Nehru remarked about the unprecedented popular response, \"it seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released.\"<ref name=\"gopalgandhi\" />\n\n==Satyagraha==\n{{main|Satyagraha}}\nGandhi had a long-standing commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience, which he termed ''satyagraha'', as the basis for achieving Indian sovereignty and self-rule .<ref>\"Gandhi's ideas about satyagraha and swaraj, moreover, galvanised the thinking of Congress cadres, most of whom by 1930 were committed to pursuing sovereignty and self-rule by nonviolent means.\" [[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 108.</ref><ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], pp. 9\u201310.</ref> Referring to the relationship between ''satyagraha'' and ''Purna Swaraj'', Gandhi saw \"an inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed and the tree\".<ref>''Hind Swaraj'', [[#GandhiDalton|Gandhi and Dalton]], p. 15.</ref> He wrote, \"If the means employed are impure, the change will not be in the direction of progress but very likely in the opposite. Only a change brought about in our political condition by pure means can lead to real progress.\"<ref>Forward to volume of Gokhale's speeches, ''\"Gopal Krishna Gokahalenan Vyakhyanao\"'' from [[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 118.</ref>\n\nSatyagraha is a synthesis of the Sanskrit words ''Satya'' (truth) and ''Agraha'' (insistence on). For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere \"passive resistance\" and became strength in practising nonviolent methods. In his words:\n\n<blockquote>Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up the use of the phrase \"passive resistance\", in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word \"satyagraha\"&nbsp;...<ref>''Satyagraha in South Africa, 1926'' from [[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 73.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis first significant attempt in India at leading mass satyagraha was the [[non-cooperation movement]] from 1920 to 1922. Even though it succeeded in raising millions of Indians in protest against the British-created [[Rowlatt Acts]], violence broke out at [[Chauri Chaura incident|Chauri Chaura]], where a mob killed 22 unarmed policemen. Gandhi suspended the protest, against the opposition of other Congress members. He decided that Indians were not yet ready for successful nonviolent resistance.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 48.</ref> The [[Bardoli Satyagraha]] in 1928 was much more successful. It succeeded in paralysing the British government and winning significant concessions. More importantly, due to extensive press coverage, it scored a propaganda victory out of all proportion to its size.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 93.</ref> Gandhi later claimed that success at Bardoli confirmed his belief in Satyagraha and Swaraj: \"It is only gradually that we shall come to know the importance of the victory gained at Bardoli&nbsp;... Bardoli has shown the way and cleared it. Swaraj lies on that route, and that alone is the cure&nbsp;...\"<ref>''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' 41: 208\u2013209</ref><ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 94.</ref> Gandhi recruited heavily from the Bardoli Satyagraha participants for the Dandi march, which passed through many of the same villages that took part in the Bardoli protests.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 95.</ref> This revolt gained momentum and had support from all parts of India.\n\n==Preparing to march==\n[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Gandhi on the Salt March]]\nOn 5 February, newspapers reported that Gandhi would begin civil disobedience by defying the salt laws.

Expectations were heightened by his repeated statements anticipating arrest, and his increasingly dramatic language as the hour approached: \"We are entering upon a life and death struggle, a holy war; we are performing an all-embracing sacrifice in which we wish to offer ourselves as oblation.\"<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 108.</ref> Correspondents from dozens of Indian, European, and American newspapers, along with film companies, responded to the drama and began covering the event.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 107.</ref>\n\nFor the march itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest discipline and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, but from the residents of his own [[ashram]], who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 104.</ref> The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based on the needs of the local residents.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 105.</ref> Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.<ref>[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 85.</ref>\n\nOn 2 March 1930 Gandhi wrote to the [[Viceroy]], [[Lord Irwin]], offering to stop the march if Irwin met eleven demands, including reduction of land revenue assessments, cutting military spending, imposing a tariff on foreign cloth, and abolishing the salt tax.<ref name=\"A & DuVall, p. 83\" /><ref>{{cite web|author=<!-- - Mahatma Gandhi --> |url=https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_redirect/ZW5fX18x/NDNfX18zNg= |title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi |publisher=Gandhi Heritage Portal |date= |accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> His strongest appeal to Irwin regarded the salt tax:\n\n<blockquote>If my letter makes no appeal to your heart, on the eleventh day of this month I shall proceed with such co-workers of the Ashram as I can take, to disregard the provisions of the Salt Laws.

An American academic writing for [[The Nation]] reported that \"60,000 persons gathered on the bank of the river to hear Gandhi's call to arms.

Gandhi gave speeches attacking the salt tax as inhuman, and the salt satyagraha as a \"poor man's struggle\". Each night they slept in the open. The only thing that was asked of the villagers was food and water to wash with. Gandhi felt that this would bring the poor into the struggle for sovereignty and self-rule, necessary for eventual victory.<ref name=\"Ackerman & DuVall, p. 86\">[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 86.</ref>\n\nThousands of satyagrahis and leaders like [[Sarojini Naidu]] joined him.

When they reached the railhead at Dandi, more than 50,000 were gathered. Gandhi gave interviews and wrote articles along the way. Foreign journalists and three Bombay cinema companies shooting newsreel footage turned Gandhi into a household name in Europe and America (at the end of 1930, ''Time'' magazine made him \"Man of the Year\").<ref name=\"Ackerman & DuVall, p. 86\"/> The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote almost daily about the Salt March, including two front-page articles on 6 and 7 April.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 221.</ref> Near the end of the march, Gandhi declared, \"I want world sympathy in this battle of right against might.\"<ref>''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' 43: 180, [[#Wolpert|Wolpert]], p. 148</ref>\n\nUpon arriving at the seashore on 5 April, Gandhi was interviewed by an [[Associated Press]] reporter. He stated:\n<blockquote>I cannot withhold my compliments from the government for the policy of complete non interference adopted by them throughout the march .... I wish I could believe this non-interference was due to any real change of heart or policy. The wanton disregard shown by them to popular feeling in the Legislative Assembly and their high-handed action leave no room for doubt that the policy of heartless exploitation of India is to be persisted in at any cost, and so the only interpretation I can put upon this non-interference is that the British Government, powerful though it is, is sensitive to world opinion which will not tolerate repression of extreme political agitation which civil disobedience undoubtedly is, so long as disobedience remains civil and therefore necessarily non-violent .... It remains to be seen whether the Government will tolerate as they have tolerated the march, the actual breach of the salt laws by countless people from tomorrow.<ref name=\"Gandhi & Jack, 1994, p. 238-239\">[[#Jack|Jack]], pp. 238\u2013239.</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=<!-- - Mahatma Gandhi --> |url=https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_redirect/ZW5fX18x/NDNfX18yMTc= |title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi |publisher=Gandhi Heritage Portal |date= |accessdate=2018-08-16}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe following morning, after a prayer, Gandhi raised a lump of salty mud and declared, \"With this, I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire.\"<ref name=\"Gandhi & Dalton, 1996, p. 72\"/> He then boiled it in seawater, producing illegal salt. He implored his thousands of followers to likewise begin making salt along the seashore, \"wherever it is convenient\" and to instruct villagers in making illegal, but necessary, salt.<ref>[[#Jack|Jack]], p. 240.</ref>\n\n==First 80 Marchers==\n79 Marchers accompanied Gandhi on his march. Most of them were between the ages of 20 and 30. These men hailed from almost all parts of the country.

A pinch of salt made by Gandhi himself sold for 1,600 [[rupee]]s (equivalent to $750 at the time). In reaction, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people by the end of the month.<ref name=\"Gandhi & Jack, 1994, p. 238-239\"/>\n\nWhat had begun as a Salt Satyagraha quickly grew into a mass Satyagraha.<ref>\"The Salt Satyagraha in the meantime grew almost spontaneously into a mass satyagraha.\" [[#Habib|Habib]], p. 57.</ref> British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax.<ref>[[#Habib|Habib]], p. 57.</ref> The British responded with more laws, including censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.<ref>\"Correspondence came under censorship, the Congress and its associate organizations were declared illegal, and their funds made subject to seizure. These measures did not appear to have any effect on the movement...\" [[#Habib|Habib]], p. 57.</ref>\n\nThere were outbreaks of violence in [[Calcutta]] (now spelled [[Kolkata]]), Karachi, and Gujarat. Unlike his suspension of satyagraha after violence broke out during the Non-co-operation movement, this time Gandhi was \"unmoved\". Appealing for violence to end, at the same time Gandhi honoured those killed in Chittagong and congratulated their parents \"for the finished sacrifices of their sons&nbsp;... A warrior's death is never a matter for sorrow.\"<ref name=\"Wolpert, 2001, p. 149\">[[#Wolpert|Wolpert]], p. 149.</ref>\n\nDuring the first phase of the civil disobedience movement from 1929 to 1931 there was a Labour government in power in Britain. The beatings at Dharasana, the shootings at Peshawar, the floggings and hangings at Solapur, the mass arrests, and much else were all presided over by a Labour prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald and his secretary of state, William Wedgwood Benn. The government was also complicit in a sustained attack on trade unionism in India,<ref>{{cite book|first=John |last=Newsinger|title=The Blood Never Dried: A People's History of the British Empire|publisher=Bookmarks Publications |year=2006|pages=144.}}</ref> an attack that Sumit Sarkar has described as \"a massive capitalist and government counter-offensive\" against workers' rights.<ref>{{cite book|first=S |last=Sarkar|title=Modern India 1885\u20131947|publisher=Basingstoke|year=1983|pages=271.}}</ref>\n\n===Qissa Khwani Bazaar massacre===\n[[File:Badshah Khan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] with Mahatma Gandhi]]\n\n{{Main|Qissa Khwani Bazaar massacre}}\n\nIn [[Peshawar]], [[satyagraha]] was led by a Muslim [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] disciple of Gandhi, [[Ghaffar Khan]], who had trained 50,000 nonviolent activists called [[Khudai Khidmatgar]].<ref>[[#Habib|Habib]], p. 55.</ref> On 23 April 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar gathered in Peshawar's [[Qissa Khwani Bazaar massacre|Qissa Kahani (Storytellers) Bazaar]]. The British ordered troops of 2/18 battalion of Royal Garhwal Rifles to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200\u2013250.<ref name=\"Habib, p. 56\">[[#Habib|Habib]], p. 56.</ref> The Pashtun satyagrahis acted in accord with their training in nonviolence, willingly facing bullets as the troops fired on them.<ref name=Johansen/> One British Indian Army Soldier Chandra Singh Garhwali and troops of the renowned [[The Garhwal Rifles|Royal Garhwal Rifles]], refused to fire at the crowds. The entire platoon was arrested and many received heavy penalties, including life imprisonment.<ref name=\"Habib, p. 56\"/>\n\n===Vedaranyam salt march===\n[[File:Vedaranyam salt march, April 1930.jpg|thumb|left|C. Rajagopalachari leading the march]]\n{{Main|Vedaranyam March}}\nWhile Gandhi marched along India's west coast, his close associate [[C. Rajagopalachari]], who would later become sovereign India's first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], organized the Vedaranyam salt march in parallel on the east coast. His group started from [[Tiruchirappalli]], in [[Madras Presidency]] (now part of [[Tamil Nadu]]), to the coastal village of [[Vedaranyam]]. After making illegal salt there, he too was arrested by the British.<ref name=\"gopalgandhi\" />\n\n===Women in civil disobedience===\nThe civil disobedience in 1930 marked the first time women became mass participants in the struggle for freedom. Thousands of women, from large cities to small villages, became active participants in satyagraha.<ref name=Chatterjee/> Gandhi had asked that only men take part in the salt march, but eventually women began manufacturing and selling salt throughout India. It was clear that though only men were allowed within the march, that both men and women were expected to forward work that would help dissolve the salt laws.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kishwar|first=Madhu|date=1986|title=Gandhi on Women|url=|journal=Race & Class|volume=28|issue=41|pages=1753\u20131758|jstor=4374920|doi=10.1177/030639688602800103}}</ref> [[Usha Mehta]], an early Gandhian activist, remarked that \"Even our old aunts and great-aunts and grandmothers used to bring pitchers of salt water to their houses and manufacture illegal salt. And then they would shout at the top of their voices: 'We have broken the salt law!'\"<ref name=Hardiman/> The growing number of women in the fight for sovereignty and self-rule was a \"new and serious feature\" according to Lord Irwin. A government report on the involvement of women stated \"thousands of them emerged&nbsp;... from the seclusion of their homes&nbsp;... in order to join Congress demonstrations and assist in picketing: and their presence on these occasions made the work the police was required to perform particularly unpleasant.\"<ref name=\"Johnson, p. 33\">[[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 33.</ref> Though women did become involved in the march, it was clear that Gandhi saw women as still playing a secondary role within the movement, but created the beginning of a push for women to be more involved in the future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n\"Sarojini Naidu was among the most visible leaders (male or female) of pre-independent India. As president of the Indian National Congress and the first woman governor of free India, she was a fervent advocate for India, avidly mobilizing support for the Indian independence movement. She was also the first woman to be arrested in the salt march.\"{{attribution needed|date=March 2019}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Restoring Women to World Studies|last=Arsenault|first=Natalie|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|pages=60\u201366|year=2009|url=https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/hemispheres/_files/pdf/women/RestoringWomenFull.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Impact===\nBritish documents show that the British government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused about whether or not to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in British government, including [[William Wedgwood Benn, 1st Viscount Stansgate|Wedgwood Benn]], Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.<ref name=\"Johnson, p. 33\"/>\n\n==Dharasana Satyagraha and aftermath==\nGandhi himself avoided further active involvement after the march, though he stayed in close contact with the developments throughout India. He created a temporary ashram near Dandi. From there, he urged women followers in [[Bombay]] (now spelled [[Mumbai]]) to picket liquor shops and foreign cloth. He said that \"a bonfire should be made of foreign cloth. Schools and colleges should become empty.\"<ref name=\"Wolpert, 2001, p. 149\"/>\n\nFor his next major action, Gandhi decided on a raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in [[Gujarat]], {{convert|25|miles|km}} south of Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. Around midnight of 4 May, as Gandhi was sleeping on a cot in a [[mango]] grove, the District [[Magistrate]] of [[Surat]] drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed [[constable]]s.<ref>[[#Jack|Jack]], pp. 244\u2013245.</ref> He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near [[Poona]] (now [[Pune]]).<ref name=Riddick/>\n\n{{Main|Dharasana Satyagraha}}\n\nThe Dharasana Satyagraha went ahead as planned, with [[Abbas Tyabji]], a seventy-six-year-old retired judge, leading the march with Gandhi's wife [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturba]] at his side. Both were arrested before reaching Dharasana and sentenced to three months in prison. After their arrests, the march continued under the leadership of [[Sarojini Naidu]], a woman poet and freedom fighter, who warned the satyagrahis, \"You must not use any violence under any circumstances. You will be beaten, but you must not resist: you must not even raise a hand to ward off blows.\" Soldiers began clubbing the satyagrahis with steel tipped [[Fighting stick|lathis]] in an incident that attracted international attention.<ref>[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], pp. 87\u201390.</ref> United Press correspondent [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]] reported that:\n\n<blockquote>Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on unprotected skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down&nbsp;... Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance&nbsp;... They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police&nbsp;... The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.\n<ref>''Webb Miller's report from May 21'', [[#Martin|Martin]], p. 38.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Vithalbhai Patel]], former Speaker of the Assembly, watched the beatings and remarked, \"All hope of reconciling India with the British Empire is lost forever.\"<ref>[[#Wolpert|Wolpert]], p. 155.</ref> Miller's first attempts at telegraphing the story to his publisher in England were censored by the British telegraph operators in India. Only after threatening to expose British censorship was his story allowed to pass. The story appeared in 1,350 newspapers throughout the world and was read into the official record of the United States Senate by Senator [[John J. Blaine]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mahatma is the Message: Gandhi's Life as Consummate Communicator|author=Singhal, Arvind|year=2014|volume= 2|issue=1 |journal=International Journal of Communication and Social Research|pages=4|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309286393}}</ref>\n\nSalt Satyagraha succeeded in drawing the attention of the world. Millions saw the newsreels showing the march. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' declared Gandhi its 1930 Man of the Year, comparing Gandhi's march to the sea \"to defy Britain's salt tax as some New Englanders once defied a British tea tax\".<ref>{{cite news| work =[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | title =Man of the Year, 1930 |  date =5 January 1931 | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,930215,00.html | accessdate =17 November 2007 }}</ref> Civil disobedience continued until early 1931, when Gandhi was finally released from prison to hold talks with Irwin. It was the first time the two held talks on equal terms,<ref>[[#GandhiDalton|Gandhi and Dalton]], p. 73.</ref> and resulted in the [[Gandhi\u2013Irwin Pact]]. The talks would lead to the Second [[Round Table Conference]] at the end of 1931.\n\n==Long-term effect==\n[[File:Salt March 2005 stampsheet of India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A 2005 stamp sheet of India dedicated to the Salt March]]\nThe Salt Satyagraha did not produce immediate progress toward dominion status or self-rule for India, did not elicit major policy concessions from the British, <ref>[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 106: \"...made scant progress toward either dominion status within the empire or outright sovereignty and self-rule. Neither had they won any major concessions on the economic and mundane issues that Gandhi considered vital.\"</ref> or attract much Muslim support.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 119-120.</ref> Congress leaders decided to end satyagraha as official policy in 1934, and Nehru and other Congress members drifted further apart from Gandhi, who withdrew from Congress to concentrate on his Constructive Programme, which included his efforts to end [[untouchability]] in the [[Harijan]] movement.<ref>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 36.</ref> However, even though British authorities were again in control by the mid-1930s, Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly began to recognise the legitimacy of claims by Gandhi and the Congress Party for sovereignty and self-rule.<ref>\"Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly recognized the legitimate claims of Gandhi and Congress for Indian independence.\" [[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 37.</ref> The Satyagraha campaign of the 1930s also forced the British to recognise that their control of India depended entirely on the consent of the Indians \u2013 Salt Satyagraha was a significant step in the British losing that consent.<ref>[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 109: \"The old order, in which British control rested comfortably on Indian acquiescence, had been sundered. In the midst of civil disobedience, Sir Charles Innes, a provincial governor, circulated his analysis of events to his colleagues. \"England can hold India only by consent,\" he conceded. \"We can't rule it by the sword.\" The British lost that consent....\"</ref>\n\nNehru considered the Salt Satyagraha the high-water mark of his association with Gandhi,<ref name=Fisher/> and felt that its lasting importance was in changing the attitudes of Indians:\n\n<blockquote>Of course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on the British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses&nbsp;... Non-cooperation dragged them out of the mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance&nbsp;... They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole&nbsp;... It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, must have the credit for it.<ref name=\"Johnson, p. 37\">[[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 37.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMore than thirty years later, Satyagraha and the March to Dandi exercised a strong influence on American civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and his fight for civil rights for blacks in the 1960s:\n\n<blockquote>Like most people, I had heard of Gandhi, but I had never studied him seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was particularly moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of ''Satyagraha'' (''Satya'' is truth which equals love, and ''agraha'' is force; ''Satyagraha'', therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for the first time its potency in the area of social reform.<ref name=\"King, p. 23\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Re-enactment in 2005==\n\nTo commemorate the Great Salt March, the [[Mahatma Gandhi Foundation]] re-enacted the Salt March on its 75th anniversary, in its exact historical schedule and route followed by the Mahatma and his band of 80 marchers. The event was known as the \"International Work for Justice and Freedom\". What started as a personal pilgrimage for Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson [[Tushar Gandhi]] turned into an international event with 900 registered participants from nine nations and on a daily basis the numbers swelled to a couple of thousands.  There was extensive reportage in the international media.\n\nThe start of the march on 10 March 2005 in Ahmedabad was attended by [[Sonia Gandhi]], Chairperson of the [[United Progressive Alliance]], as well as several [[Indian Cabinet Ministers]], many of whom joined the march at different locations along the route and walked apart of the way.\n\nThe participants halted at Dandi on the night of 5 April, with the commemoration ending on 7 April. At the finale in Dandi, the prime minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, greeted the marchers and promised to build an appropriate monument at Dandi to commemorate the marchers and the historical event.

The 24-day march lasted from 12 March 1930 to 6 April 1930 as a [[direct action]] campaign of [[tax resistance]] and [[Nonviolent resistance|nonviolent protest]] against the [[History of the British salt tax in India|British salt monopoly]]. Another reason for this march was that the Civil Disobedience Movement needed a strong inauguration that would inspire more people to follow Gandhi's example. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] started this march with 80 of his trusted volunteers.<ref name=\"NSS\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dandimemorial.in/pdf/List-of-1930-Salt-Marchers.pdf|title=National Salt Satyagraha Memorial {{!}} List of names|website=www.dandimemorial.in|access-date=11 August 2019}}</ref> Walking ten miles a day for 24 days, the march spanned over 240 miles (384&nbsp;km), from [[Sabarmati Ashram]] to [[Dandi, Navsari|Dandi]], which was called [[Navsari]] at that time (now in the state of Gujarat). Growing numbers of Indians joined them along the way. When Gandhi broke the salt laws at 6:30&nbsp;am on 6 April 1930, it sparked large scale acts of civil disobedience against the [[British Raj]] [[history of the British salt tax in India|salt laws]] by millions of Indians.<ref>\"Mass civil disobedience throughout India followed as millions broke the salt laws\", from Dalton's introduction to Gandhi's ''Civil Disobedience'', [[#GandhiDalton|Gandhi and Dalton]], p. 72.</ref>\n\nAfter making the salt by evaporation at Dandi, Gandhi continued southward along the coast, making salt and addressing meetings on the way. The Congress Party planned to stage a satyagraha at the Dharasana Salt Works, 25 miles south of Dandi. However, Gandhi was arrested on the midnight of 4\u20135 May 1930, just days before the planned action at Dharasana. The Dandi March and the ensuing [[Dharasana Satyagraha]] drew worldwide attention to the [[Indian independence movement]] through extensive newspaper and newsreel coverage. The [[satyagraha]] against the salt tax continued for almost a year, ending with Gandhi's release from jail and negotiations with [[Viceroy]] [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Irwin]] at the Second [[Round Table Conference]].<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 92.</ref> Although over 60,000 Indians were jailed as a result of the Salt Satyagraha, <ref>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 234.</ref> the British did not make immediate major concessions. <ref>[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 106.</ref>\n\nThe Salt Satyagraha campaign was based upon Gandhi's principles of non-violent protest called ''[[satyagraha]]'', which he loosely translated as \"truth-force\".<ref>\"Its root meaning is holding onto truth, hence truth-force. I have also called it Love-force or Soul-force.\" Gandhi (2001), p. 6.</ref> Literally, it is formed from the [[Sanskrit]] words ''satya'', \"truth\", and ''agraha'', \"insistence\".  In early 1930 the Indian National Congress chose satyagraha as their main tactic for winning Indian sovereignty and self-rule from British rule and appointed Gandhi to organise the campaign. Gandhi chose the 1882 British Salt Act as the first target of satyagraha. The Salt March to Dandi, and the beating by British police of hundreds of nonviolent protesters in Dharasana, which received worldwide news coverage, demonstrated the effective use of civil disobedience as a technique for fighting social and political injustice.<ref>[[#Martin|Martin]], p. 35.</ref> The satyagraha teachings of Gandhi and the March to Dandi had a significant influence on American activists [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[James Bevel]], and others during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] for civil rights for African Americans and other minority groups in the 1960s.<ref name=\"King, p. 23\"/> The march was the most significant organised challenge to British authority since the [[Non-cooperation movement]] of 1920\u201322, and directly followed the [[Purna Swaraj]] declaration of sovereignty and self-rule by the [[Indian National Congress]] on 26 January 1930.<ref>{{cite book|title=Eyewitness Gandhi|date=2014|publisher=Dorling Kinderseley Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0241185667|page=44|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hY3WAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=dharasana+navsari#v=onepage&q=dharasana%20navsari&f=false|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> It gained worldwide attention which gave impetus to the [[Indian independence movement]] and started the nationwide Civil Disobedience Movement.\n\n== Declaration of sovereignty and self-rule ==\n{{main|Purna Swaraj}}\n[[File:Mahatma & Sarojini Naidu 1930.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[Sarojini Naidu]] during the March.]]\nAt midnight on 31 December 1929, the [[Indian National Congress]] raised the tricolour [[flag of India]] on the banks of the [[Ravi River|Ravi]] at [[Lahore]]. The Indian National Congress, led by [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], publicly issued the Declaration of sovereignty and self-rule, or [[Purna Swaraj]], on 26 January 1930.<ref name=Wolpert2001>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/gandhispassionli00wolp/page/141|title=Gandhi's passion : the life and legacy of Mahatma Gandhi|last=Wolpert|first=Stanley A.|date=2001|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=|isbn=019513060X|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/gandhispassionli00wolp/page/141 141]|oclc=252581969|url-access=registration}}</ref> (Literally in [[Sanskrit]], ''purna'', \"complete,\" ''swa'', \"self,\" ''raj'', \"rule,\" so therefore \"complete self-rule\".) The declaration included the readiness to withhold taxes, and the statement:\n\n<blockquote>We believe that it is the inalienable right of the Indian people, as of any other people, to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life, so that they may have full opportunities of growth. We believe also that if any government deprives a people of these rights and oppresses them the people have a further right to alter it or abolish it. The British government in India has not only deprived the Indian people of their freedom but has based itself on the exploitation of the masses, and has ruined India economically, politically, culturally and spiritually. We believe therefore, that India must sever the British connection and attain ''Purna Swaraji'' or complete sovereignty and self-rule.<ref name=Wolpert1999/></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Congress Working Committee]] gave Gandhi the responsibility for organising the first act of [[civil disobedience]], with Congress itself ready to take charge after Gandhi's expected arrest.<ref name=\"A & DuVall, p. 83\">[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 83.</ref> Gandhi's plan was to begin civil disobedience with a satyagraha aimed at the [[History of the British salt tax in India|British salt tax]]. The 1882 Salt Act gave the British a monopoly on the collection and manufacture of salt, limiting its handling to government salt depots and levying a salt tax.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 91.</ref> Violation of the Salt Act was a criminal offence. Even though salt was freely available to those living on the coast (by evaporation of sea water), Indians were forced to buy it from the colonial government.\n\n==Choice of salt as protest focus==\nInitially, Gandhi's choice of the salt tax was met with incredulity by the Working Committee of the Congress,<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 100.</ref> [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and Dibyalochan Sahoo were ambivalent; [[Sardar Patel]] suggested a land revenue boycott instead.<ref>\"Nehru, who had been skeptical about salt as the primary focus of the campaign, realized how wrong he was&nbsp;...\" [[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 32.</ref><ref name=\"gopalgandhi\">Gandhi, Gopalkrishna.

The [[Viceroy]] himself, [[Lord Irwin]], did not take the threat of a salt protest seriously, writing to London, \"At present the prospect of a salt campaign does not keep me awake at night.\"<ref>Letter to London on 20 February 1930. [[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 84.</ref>\n\nHowever, Gandhi had sound reasons for his decision. An item of daily use could resonate more with all classes of citizens than an abstract demand for greater political rights.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gross|first=David M.|year=2014|title=99 Tactics of Successful Tax Resistance Campaigns|publisher=Picket Line Press|isbn=978-1490572741|page=64}}</ref> The salt tax represented 8.2% of the British Raj tax revenue, and hurt the poorest Indians the most significantly.<ref name=\"Gandhi & Dalton, 1996, p. 72\">[[#GandhiDalton|Gandhi and Dalton]], p. 72.</ref>\nExplaining his choice, Gandhi said, \"Next to air and water, salt is perhaps the greatest necessity of life.\" In contrast to the other leaders, the prominent Congress statesman and future [[Governor-General of India]], [[C. Rajagopalachari]], understood Gandhi's viewpoint. In a public meeting at [[Tuticorin]], he said:\n\n<blockquote>Suppose, a people rise in revolt. They cannot attack the abstract constitution or lead an army against proclamations and statutes&nbsp;... Civil disobedience has to be directed against the salt tax or the land tax or some other particular point&nbsp;\u2013 not that; that is our final end, but for the time being it is our aim, and we must shoot straight.<ref name=\"gopalgandhi\" /></blockquote>\n\nGandhi felt that this protest would dramatise Purna Swaraj in a way that was meaningful to every Indian. He also reasoned that it would build unity between Hindus and Muslims by fighting a wrong that touched them equally.<ref name=\"A & DuVall, p. 83\" />\n\nAfter the protest gathered steam, the leaders realised the power of salt as a symbol. Nehru remarked about the unprecedented popular response, \"it seemed as though a spring had been suddenly released.\"<ref name=\"gopalgandhi\" />\n\n==Satyagraha==\n{{main|Satyagraha}}\nGandhi had a long-standing commitment to nonviolent civil disobedience, which he termed ''satyagraha'', as the basis for achieving Indian sovereignty and self-rule .<ref>\"Gandhi's ideas about satyagraha and swaraj, moreover, galvanised the thinking of Congress cadres, most of whom by 1930 were committed to pursuing sovereignty and self-rule by nonviolent means.\" [[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 108.</ref><ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], pp. 9\u201310.</ref> Referring to the relationship between ''satyagraha'' and ''Purna Swaraj'', Gandhi saw \"an inviolable connection between the means and the end as there is between the seed and the tree\".<ref>''Hind Swaraj'', [[#GandhiDalton|Gandhi and Dalton]], p. 15.</ref> He wrote, \"If the means employed are impure, the change will not be in the direction of progress but very likely in the opposite. Only a change brought about in our political condition by pure means can lead to real progress.\"<ref>Forward to volume of Gokhale's speeches, ''\"Gopal Krishna Gokahalenan Vyakhyanao\"'' from [[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 118.</ref>\n\nSatyagraha is a synthesis of the Sanskrit words ''Satya'' (truth) and ''Agraha'' (insistence on). For Gandhi, satyagraha went far beyond mere \"passive resistance\" and became strength in practising nonviolent methods. In his words:\n\n<blockquote>Truth (satya) implies love, and firmness (agraha) engenders and therefore serves as a synonym for force. I thus began to call the Indian movement Satyagraha, that is to say, the Force which is born of Truth and Love or nonviolence, and gave up the use of the phrase \"passive resistance\", in connection with it, so much so that even in English writing we often avoided it and used instead the word \"satyagraha\"&nbsp;...<ref>''Satyagraha in South Africa, 1926'' from [[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 73.</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis first significant attempt in India at leading mass satyagraha was the [[non-cooperation movement]] from 1920 to 1922. Even though it succeeded in raising millions of Indians in protest against the British-created [[Rowlatt Acts]], violence broke out at [[Chauri Chaura incident|Chauri Chaura]], where a mob killed 22 unarmed policemen. Gandhi suspended the protest, against the opposition of other Congress members. He decided that Indians were not yet ready for successful nonviolent resistance.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 48.</ref> The [[Bardoli Satyagraha]] in 1928 was much more successful. It succeeded in paralysing the British government and winning significant concessions. More importantly, due to extensive press coverage, it scored a propaganda victory out of all proportion to its size.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 93.</ref> Gandhi later claimed that success at Bardoli confirmed his belief in Satyagraha and Swaraj: \"It is only gradually that we shall come to know the importance of the victory gained at Bardoli&nbsp;... Bardoli has shown the way and cleared it. Swaraj lies on that route, and that alone is the cure&nbsp;...\"<ref>''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' 41: 208\u2013209</ref><ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 94.</ref> Gandhi recruited heavily from the Bardoli Satyagraha participants for the Dandi march, which passed through many of the same villages that took part in the Bardoli protests.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 95.</ref> This revolt gained momentum and had support from all parts of India.\n\n==Preparing to march==\n[[File:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Gandhi on the Salt March]]\nOn 5 February, newspapers reported that Gandhi would begin civil disobedience by defying the salt laws. The salt satyagraha would begin on 12 March and end in Dandi with Gandhi breaking the Salt Act on 6 April.<ref name=\"gandhiheritageportal.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/dandi-march-details |title=Chronology: Event Detail Page |publisher=Gandhi Heritage Portal |date=15 June 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> Gandhi chose 6 April to launch the mass breaking of the salt laws for a symbolic reason\u2014it was the first day of \"National Week\", begun in 1919 when Gandhi conceived of the national [[hartal]] (strike) against the [[Rowlatt Act]].<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 113.</ref>\n\nGandhi prepared the worldwide media for the march by issuing regular statements from Sabarmati, at his regular prayer meetings and through direct contact with the press. Expectations were heightened by his repeated statements anticipating arrest, and his increasingly dramatic language as the hour approached: \"We are entering upon a life and death struggle, a holy war; we are performing an all-embracing sacrifice in which we wish to offer ourselves as oblation.\"<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 108.</ref> Correspondents from dozens of Indian, European, and American newspapers, along with film companies, responded to the drama and began covering the event.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 107.</ref>\n\nFor the march itself, Gandhi wanted the strictest discipline and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa. For that reason, he recruited the marchers not from Congress Party members, but from the residents of his own [[ashram]], who were trained in Gandhi's strict standards of discipline.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 104.</ref> The 24-day march would pass through 4 districts and 48 villages. The route of the march, along with each evening's stopping place, was planned based on recruitment potential, past contacts, and timing. Gandhi sent scouts to each village ahead of the march so he could plan his talks at each resting place, based on the needs of the local residents.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 105.</ref> Events at each village were scheduled and publicised in Indian and foreign press.<ref>[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 85.</ref>\n\nOn 2 March 1930 Gandhi wrote to the [[Viceroy]], [[Lord Irwin]], offering to stop the march if Irwin met eleven demands, including reduction of land revenue assessments, cutting military spending, imposing a tariff on foreign cloth, and abolishing the salt tax.<ref name=\"A & DuVall, p. 83\" /><ref>{{cite web|author=<!-- - Mahatma Gandhi --> |url=https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_redirect/ZW5fX18x/NDNfX18zNg= |title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi |publisher=Gandhi Heritage Portal |date= |accessdate=16 August 2018}}</ref> His strongest appeal to Irwin regarded the salt tax:\n\n<blockquote>If my letter makes no appeal to your heart, on the eleventh day of this month I shall proceed with such co-workers of the Ashram as I can take, to disregard the provisions of the Salt Laws.

Gandhi gave speeches attacking the salt tax as inhuman, and the salt satyagraha as a \"poor man's struggle\". Each night they slept in the open. The only thing that was asked of the villagers was food and water to wash with. Gandhi felt that this would bring the poor into the struggle for sovereignty and self-rule, necessary for eventual victory.<ref name=\"Ackerman & DuVall, p. 86\">[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 86.</ref>\n\nThousands of satyagrahis and leaders like [[Sarojini Naidu]] joined him.

When they reached the railhead at Dandi, more than 50,000 were gathered. Gandhi gave interviews and wrote articles along the way. Foreign journalists and three Bombay cinema companies shooting newsreel footage turned Gandhi into a household name in Europe and America (at the end of 1930, ''Time'' magazine made him \"Man of the Year\").<ref name=\"Ackerman & DuVall, p. 86\"/> The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote almost daily about the Salt March, including two front-page articles on 6 and 7 April.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 221.</ref> Near the end of the march, Gandhi declared, \"I want world sympathy in this battle of right against might.\"<ref>''Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi'' 43: 180, [[#Wolpert|Wolpert]], p. 148</ref>\n\nUpon arriving at the seashore on 5 April, Gandhi was interviewed by an [[Associated Press]] reporter. He stated:\n<blockquote>I cannot withhold my compliments from the government for the policy of complete non interference adopted by them throughout the march .... I wish I could believe this non-interference was due to any real change of heart or policy. The wanton disregard shown by them to popular feeling in the Legislative Assembly and their high-handed action leave no room for doubt that the policy of heartless exploitation of India is to be persisted in at any cost, and so the only interpretation I can put upon this non-interference is that the British Government, powerful though it is, is sensitive to world opinion which will not tolerate repression of extreme political agitation which civil disobedience undoubtedly is, so long as disobedience remains civil and therefore necessarily non-violent .... It remains to be seen whether the Government will tolerate as they have tolerated the march, the actual breach of the salt laws by countless people from tomorrow.<ref name=\"Gandhi & Jack, 1994, p. 238-239\">[[#Jack|Jack]], pp. 238\u2013239.</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=<!-- - Mahatma Gandhi --> |url=https://www.gandhiheritageportal.org/cwmg_redirect/ZW5fX18x/NDNfX18yMTc= |title=The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi |publisher=Gandhi Heritage Portal |date= |accessdate=2018-08-16}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe following morning, after a prayer, Gandhi raised a lump of salty mud and declared, \"With this, I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire.\"<ref name=\"Gandhi & Dalton, 1996, p. 72\"/> He then boiled it in seawater, producing illegal salt. He implored his thousands of followers to likewise begin making salt along the seashore, \"wherever it is convenient\" and to instruct villagers in making illegal, but necessary, salt.<ref>[[#Jack|Jack]], p. 240.</ref>\n\n==First 80 Marchers==\n79 Marchers accompanied Gandhi on his march. Most of them were between the ages of 20 and 30. These men hailed from almost all parts of the country.

In reaction, the British government arrested over sixty thousand people by the end of the month.<ref name=\"Gandhi & Jack, 1994, p. 238-239\"/>\n\nWhat had begun as a Salt Satyagraha quickly grew into a mass Satyagraha.<ref>\"The Salt Satyagraha in the meantime grew almost spontaneously into a mass satyagraha.\" [[#Habib|Habib]], p. 57.</ref> British cloth and goods were boycotted. Unpopular forest laws were defied in the Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces. Gujarati peasants refused to pay tax, under threat of losing their crops and land. In Midnapore, Bengalis took part by refusing to pay the chowkidar tax.<ref>[[#Habib|Habib]], p. 57.</ref> The British responded with more laws, including censorship of correspondence and declaring the Congress and its associate organisations illegal. None of those measures slowed the civil disobedience movement.<ref>\"Correspondence came under censorship, the Congress and its associate organizations were declared illegal, and their funds made subject to seizure. These measures did not appear to have any effect on the movement...\" [[#Habib|Habib]], p. 57.</ref>\n\nThere were outbreaks of violence in [[Calcutta]] (now spelled [[Kolkata]]), Karachi, and Gujarat. Unlike his suspension of satyagraha after violence broke out during the Non-co-operation movement, this time Gandhi was \"unmoved\". Appealing for violence to end, at the same time Gandhi honoured those killed in Chittagong and congratulated their parents \"for the finished sacrifices of their sons&nbsp;... A warrior's death is never a matter for sorrow.\"<ref name=\"Wolpert, 2001, p. 149\">[[#Wolpert|Wolpert]], p. 149.</ref>\n\nDuring the first phase of the civil disobedience movement from 1929 to 1931 there was a Labour government in power in Britain. The beatings at Dharasana, the shootings at Peshawar, the floggings and hangings at Solapur, the mass arrests, and much else were all presided over by a Labour prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald and his secretary of state, William Wedgwood Benn. The government was also complicit in a sustained attack on trade unionism in India,<ref>{{cite book|first=John |last=Newsinger|title=The Blood Never Dried: A People's History of the British Empire|publisher=Bookmarks Publications |year=2006|pages=144.}}</ref> an attack that Sumit Sarkar has described as \"a massive capitalist and government counter-offensive\" against workers' rights.<ref>{{cite book|first=S |last=Sarkar|title=Modern India 1885\u20131947|publisher=Basingstoke|year=1983|pages=271.}}</ref>\n\n===Qissa Khwani Bazaar massacre===\n[[File:Badshah Khan.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]] with Mahatma Gandhi]]\n\n{{Main|Qissa Khwani Bazaar massacre}}\n\nIn [[Peshawar]], [[satyagraha]] was led by a Muslim [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] disciple of Gandhi, [[Ghaffar Khan]], who had trained 50,000 nonviolent activists called [[Khudai Khidmatgar]].<ref>[[#Habib|Habib]], p. 55.</ref> On 23 April 1930, Ghaffar Khan was arrested. A crowd of Khudai Khidmatgar gathered in Peshawar's [[Qissa Khwani Bazaar massacre|Qissa Kahani (Storytellers) Bazaar]]. The British ordered troops of 2/18 battalion of Royal Garhwal Rifles to open fire with machine guns on the unarmed crowd, killing an estimated 200\u2013250.<ref name=\"Habib, p. 56\">[[#Habib|Habib]], p. 56.</ref> The Pashtun satyagrahis acted in accord with their training in nonviolence, willingly facing bullets as the troops fired on them.<ref name=Johansen/> One British Indian Army Soldier Chandra Singh Garhwali and troops of the renowned [[The Garhwal Rifles|Royal Garhwal Rifles]], refused to fire at the crowds.

Rajagopalachari leading the march]]\n{{Main|Vedaranyam March}}\nWhile Gandhi marched along India's west coast, his close associate [[C. Rajagopalachari]], who would later become sovereign India's first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], organized the Vedaranyam salt march in parallel on the east coast. His group started from [[Tiruchirappalli]], in [[Madras Presidency]] (now part of [[Tamil Nadu]]), to the coastal village of [[Vedaranyam]]. After making illegal salt there, he too was arrested by the British.<ref name=\"gopalgandhi\" />\n\n===Women in civil disobedience===\nThe civil disobedience in 1930 marked the first time women became mass participants in the struggle for freedom. Thousands of women, from large cities to small villages, became active participants in satyagraha.<ref name=Chatterjee/> Gandhi had asked that only men take part in the salt march, but eventually women began manufacturing and selling salt throughout India. It was clear that though only men were allowed within the march, that both men and women were expected to forward work that would help dissolve the salt laws.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kishwar|first=Madhu|date=1986|title=Gandhi on Women|url=|journal=Race & Class|volume=28|issue=41|pages=1753\u20131758|jstor=4374920|doi=10.1177/030639688602800103}}</ref> [[Usha Mehta]], an early Gandhian activist, remarked that \"Even our old aunts and great-aunts and grandmothers used to bring pitchers of salt water to their houses and manufacture illegal salt. And then they would shout at the top of their voices: 'We have broken the salt law!'\"<ref name=Hardiman/> The growing number of women in the fight for sovereignty and self-rule was a \"new and serious feature\" according to Lord Irwin. A government report on the involvement of women stated \"thousands of them emerged&nbsp;... from the seclusion of their homes&nbsp;... in order to join Congress demonstrations and assist in picketing: and their presence on these occasions made the work the police was required to perform particularly unpleasant.\"<ref name=\"Johnson, p. 33\">[[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 33.</ref> Though women did become involved in the march, it was clear that Gandhi saw women as still playing a secondary role within the movement, but created the beginning of a push for women to be more involved in the future.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n\"Sarojini Naidu was among the most visible leaders (male or female) of pre-independent India. As president of the Indian National Congress and the first woman governor of free India, she was a fervent advocate for India, avidly mobilizing support for the Indian independence movement. She was also the first woman to be arrested in the salt march.\"{{attribution needed|date=March 2019}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Restoring Women to World Studies|last=Arsenault|first=Natalie|publisher=The University of Texas at Austin|pages=60\u201366|year=2009|url=https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/hemispheres/_files/pdf/women/RestoringWomenFull.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Impact===\nBritish documents show that the British government was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused about whether or not to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930. Curry and others in British government, including [[William Wedgwood Benn, 1st Viscount Stansgate|Wedgwood Benn]], Secretary of State for India, preferred fighting violent rather than nonviolent opponents.<ref name=\"Johnson, p. 33\"/>\n\n==Dharasana Satyagraha and aftermath==\nGandhi himself avoided further active involvement after the march, though he stayed in close contact with the developments throughout India. He created a temporary ashram near Dandi. From there, he urged women followers in [[Bombay]] (now spelled [[Mumbai]]) to picket liquor shops and foreign cloth. He said that \"a bonfire should be made of foreign cloth. Schools and colleges should become empty.\"<ref name=\"Wolpert, 2001, p. 149\"/>\n\nFor his next major action, Gandhi decided on a raid of the Dharasana Salt Works in [[Gujarat]], {{convert|25|miles|km}} south of Dandi. He wrote to Lord Irwin, again telling him of his plans. Around midnight of 4 May, as Gandhi was sleeping on a cot in a [[mango]] grove, the District [[Magistrate]] of [[Surat]] drove up with two Indian officers and thirty heavily armed [[constable]]s.<ref>[[#Jack|Jack]], pp. 244\u2013245.</ref> He was arrested under an 1827 regulation calling for the jailing of people engaged in unlawful activities, and held without trial near [[Poona]] (now [[Pune]]).<ref name=Riddick/>\n\n{{Main|Dharasana Satyagraha}}\n\nThe Dharasana Satyagraha went ahead as planned, with [[Abbas Tyabji]], a seventy-six-year-old retired judge, leading the march with Gandhi's wife [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturba]] at his side. Both were arrested before reaching Dharasana and sentenced to three months in prison. After their arrests, the march continued under the leadership of [[Sarojini Naidu]], a woman poet and freedom fighter, who warned the satyagrahis, \"You must not use any violence under any circumstances. You will be beaten, but you must not resist: you must not even raise a hand to ward off blows.\" Soldiers began clubbing the satyagrahis with steel tipped [[Fighting stick|lathis]] in an incident that attracted international attention.<ref>[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], pp. 87\u201390.</ref> United Press correspondent [[Webb Miller (journalist)|Webb Miller]] reported that:\n\n<blockquote>Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on unprotected skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down&nbsp;... Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance&nbsp;... They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police&nbsp;... The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.\n<ref>''Webb Miller's report from May 21'', [[#Martin|Martin]], p. 38.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Vithalbhai Patel]], former Speaker of the Assembly, watched the beatings and remarked, \"All hope of reconciling India with the British Empire is lost forever.\"<ref>[[#Wolpert|Wolpert]], p. 155.</ref> Miller's first attempts at telegraphing the story to his publisher in England were censored by the British telegraph operators in India. Only after threatening to expose British censorship was his story allowed to pass. The story appeared in 1,350 newspapers throughout the world and was read into the official record of the United States Senate by Senator [[John J. Blaine]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Mahatma is the Message: Gandhi's Life as Consummate Communicator|author=Singhal, Arvind|year=2014|volume= 2|issue=1 |journal=International Journal of Communication and Social Research|pages=4|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309286393}}</ref>\n\nSalt Satyagraha succeeded in drawing the attention of the world. Millions saw the newsreels showing the march.

It was the first time the two held talks on equal terms,<ref>[[#GandhiDalton|Gandhi and Dalton]], p. 73.</ref> and resulted in the [[Gandhi\u2013Irwin Pact]]. The talks would lead to the Second [[Round Table Conference]] at the end of 1931.\n\n==Long-term effect==\n[[File:Salt March 2005 stampsheet of India.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A 2005 stamp sheet of India dedicated to the Salt March]]\nThe Salt Satyagraha did not produce immediate progress toward dominion status or self-rule for India, did not elicit major policy concessions from the British, <ref>[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 106: \"...made scant progress toward either dominion status within the empire or outright sovereignty and self-rule. Neither had they won any major concessions on the economic and mundane issues that Gandhi considered vital.\"</ref> or attract much Muslim support.<ref>[[#Dalton|Dalton]], p. 119-120.</ref> Congress leaders decided to end satyagraha as official policy in 1934, and Nehru and other Congress members drifted further apart from Gandhi, who withdrew from Congress to concentrate on his Constructive Programme, which included his efforts to end [[untouchability]] in the [[Harijan]] movement.<ref>[[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 36.</ref> However, even though British authorities were again in control by the mid-1930s, Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly began to recognise the legitimacy of claims by Gandhi and the Congress Party for sovereignty and self-rule.<ref>\"Indian, British, and world opinion increasingly recognized the legitimate claims of Gandhi and Congress for Indian independence.\" [[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 37.</ref> The Satyagraha campaign of the 1930s also forced the British to recognise that their control of India depended entirely on the consent of the Indians \u2013 Salt Satyagraha was a significant step in the British losing that consent.<ref>[[#Ackerman|Ackerman]], p. 109: \"The old order, in which British control rested comfortably on Indian acquiescence, had been sundered. In the midst of civil disobedience, Sir Charles Innes, a provincial governor, circulated his analysis of events to his colleagues. \"England can hold India only by consent,\" he conceded. \"We can't rule it by the sword.\" The British lost that consent....\"</ref>\n\nNehru considered the Salt Satyagraha the high-water mark of his association with Gandhi,<ref name=Fisher/> and felt that its lasting importance was in changing the attitudes of Indians:\n\n<blockquote>Of course these movements exercised tremendous pressure on the British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses&nbsp;... Non-cooperation dragged them out of the mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance&nbsp;... They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole&nbsp;... It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, must have the credit for it.<ref name=\"Johnson, p. 37\">[[#Johnson|Johnson]], p. 37.</ref></blockquote>\n\nMore than thirty years later, Satyagraha and the March to Dandi exercised a strong influence on American civil rights activist [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and his fight for civil rights for blacks in the 1960s:\n\n<blockquote>Like most people, I had heard of Gandhi, but I had never studied him seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was particularly moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of ''Satyagraha'' (''Satya'' is truth which equals love, and ''agraha'' is force; ''Satyagraha'', therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant to me. As I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see for the first time its potency in the area of social reform.<ref name=\"King, p. 23\"/></blockquote>\n\n==Re-enactment in 2005==\n\nTo commemorate the Great Salt March, the [[Mahatma Gandhi Foundation]] re-enacted the Salt March on its 75th anniversary, in its exact historical schedule and route followed by the Mahatma and his band of 80 marchers. The event was known as the \"International Walk for Justice and Freedom\". What started as a personal pilgrimage for Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson [[Tushar Gandhi]] turned into an international event with 900 registered participants from nine nations and on a daily basis the numbers swelled to a couple of thousands.  There was extensive reportage in the international media.\n\nThe start of the march on 12 March 2005 in Ahmedabad was attended by [[Sonia Gandhi]], Chairperson of the [[United Progressive Alliance]], as well as several [[Indian Cabinet Ministers]], many of whom joined the march at different locations along the route and walked part of the way.\n\nThe participants halted at Dandi on the night of 5 April, with the commemoration ending on 7 April. At the finale in Dandi, the prime minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh, greeted the marchers and promised to build an appropriate monument at Dandi to commemorate the marchers and the historical event.
