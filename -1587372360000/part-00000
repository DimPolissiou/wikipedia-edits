In October 2018, eleven years after the season's original airing, fellow contestant Joanna Dunn revealed via [[Facebook]] that producers had discovered he was spreading salacious rumors about her to other contestants, disqualified him immediately afterwards, and subsequently scrapped almost all footage of him. Despite this, he can still be seen briefly in several frames of the first episode (although he disappears shortly thereafter), and his burned picture can still be seen next to Joanna's when she is eliminated. Many uncertainties still remain concerning J.R., such as when exactly he left the set or presented his signature dish, if he even did so at all. This contestant should not be confused with [[Hell's Kitchen (American season 13)|Season 13]]'s JR, who is an entirely different chef.<ref>https://www.reddit.com/r/HellsKitchen/comments/9p6wzq/conclusion_about_jr/</ref><ref>{{cite episode|title=Hell's kitchen.us.season 3 episode 3|series=Hell's Kitchen|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHgP7WKMUGY|minutes=JR's burned picture appears 40:23}}</ref>{{Unreliable fringe source|date=September 2019}}\n\n==Contestant progress==\nEach week, the best member (as determined by Ramsay) from the losing team during the latest service period is asked to nominate two of their teammates for elimination; one of these two is sent home by Ramsay.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!colspan=5|\n!colspan=5|Original teams\n!Switched teams\n!Original teams\n!colspan=2|Individual\n!Finals\n|-\n!

The episode opened with [[Gordon Ramsay]] seated at a table in the restaurant, telling viewers he was going to be nicer this time around. After a few seconds, he admitted he was joking. The contestants arrived, and ma\u00eetre d\u2019 Jean Philippe Susilovic began to brief the chefs, until Ramsay interrupted, instructing the contestants to get to the kitchen and prepare their ''\"signature dish\"''.\n\n'''Signature dishes''': Each contestant prepared their signature dish for evaluation by Ramsay. He declared Melissa's peppered steak and asparagus and Tiffany's seafood tostada as the best. He also had some praise for Julia and Aaron's dishes, but felt that Julia's dish was spoiled by an excessive amount of pepper, and that Aaron had over-complicated his [[finger food]] dish with a needless amount of garnishes. Ramsay was also initially impressed with Rock's scallop and gnocchi dish but refused to eat it when he learned that the gnocchi was frozen as Rock did not have enough time to it from scratch - even then, he stated it could've been a great dish. The remaining dishes were all felt to be generally unimpressive. Ramsay found Vinnie's dish too spicy and disappointing with Vinnie revealing an open disagreement and lead to Ramsay saying to himself out loud \"What a fucking jerk!\", Joanna's dish was dry and salty, Josh's foie gras was too undercooked and salty and Ramsay could recognize Bonnie's lack of experience with her cheese platter. Brad and Eddie both made under-par scallop dishes and Ramsay was aggravated when Brad thought Eddie's scallops were \"cooked right\" since Ramsay found the scallops raw, Eddie (whilst thinking Brad's dish wasn't bad) felt the vanilla ruined it for him and Jen's pancake was too thick and there was too much alcohol in her dish as well.\n\n'''Pre-Service''': Whilst Brad got the team organised during prep, Aaron however struggled to prep the ice cream with Rock showing him how to prep it. The women completely isolated Julia due to her being a waffle house cook, even though she tried to help. To make matters worse, Joanna attempted to dictate over the team and annoyed the women (and Bonnie in particular) for telling them that they were incorrectly prepping the stock for service when they were actually doing it the right way. Sous chef MaryAnn even showed worries for the upcoming service due to Joanna's horrific leadership.\n\n'''Service''': Before service, Julia told Ramsay that she didn't think the team was ready, but Joanna and Tiffany reassured him that they were. Aaron also became over-emotional before service, forcing Ramsay to calm him down and holding up the restaurant's opening. In the service, Vinnie couldn't successfully cook any appetizers for the blue team, and was thrown off the station for using water rather than vegetable stock, he instead resorted to cleaning dishes. Brad got the remaining appetizers out without any trouble, but Aaron had trouble on the meat and had to leave service because he felt exhausted, whilst Ramsay had to again calm him down. Josh took over the station, but found out that Aaron had overcooked the team's entire supply of chicken, making it impossible for the team to proceed in service. The red team also had trouble on the appetizers, as both Tiffany and Bonnie failed to cook eggs for the scallops, while Joanna repeatedly berated and insulted Julia when she tried to help. When Julia broke down because her team refused to let her help, Ramsay ordered Julia and Melissa to take over the appetizers, after which they were able to get some of the appetizers out, though progress was still slow due to Joanna continuing to argue with the other women. After seeing this, Ramsay shut the service down. During the post-mortem Ramsay asked Vinnie a question about his performance, to which Vinnie blamed Ramsay for his lack of direction. Ramsay called him a \"two-faced lazy little fucker\", which angers Vinnie and he replies saying \"Lazy!?\". Ramsay declared the blue team as the winners since they at least served all their appetizers, while the red team, now dubbed \"Hell's Bitches\" for their in-fighting, couldn't even manage that. Melissa, who had stepped up as a leader, was named the red team's best of the worst and told to nominate two women for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': Melissa nominated Joanna for her bad attitude, and Tiffany for not getting any appetizers out. The two had tried to persuade her to nominate Julia for not having professional experience, but she ignored them, feeling Julia had managed to successfully get out appetizers and was at least a good team player, whereas they had failed at both. Ramsay eliminated Tiffany for making too many basic mistakes.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/301.htm Hell's Kitchen \u2013 Episode 3.01 recap], Fox {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604170345/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/301.htm |date=June 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"To be a great chef, you need great attention to detail, passion and great work ethic. Tiffany worked hard, but that was it. Nothing else.\"\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 24\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n| Title = 11 Chefs Compete\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|6|11}}\n| ShortSummary =\n'''Team challenge''': The teams were woken up early to retrieve and prepare Dover sole for dinner service. While bringing the fish in, Aaron claimed to suffer from cramps and Ramsay excused him from the challenge, automatically balancing out the teams. The teams had 30 minutes to carefully remove the skin and extract the roe from as many fishes as possible; Ramsay inspected each one and made a pass/fail determination. The men were let down by Vinnie having neglected to prepare any correctly, though Josh, Brad, Eddie and Rock pulled the score up to eight. Melissa single-handedly earned half of this by having four acceptable servings, while Julia had two. Despite Jen and Bonnie failing to earn any and Joanna having only prepared three, all three of hers were acceptable, leading to a victory for the women.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women spent the day fishing with Ramsay. The men prepared the remaining sole for the dinner service.\n\n'''Service''':  Ramsay instructed Aaron to work in the dining room by deboning the dover sole when served, which was the men's 2nd part of the punishment, though during preparation, he showed signs he may not be able to continue during service. Despite his apparent well-being later on, he was found to be talking to diners, taking too long to prepare the fish (to the point where it was cold and sent back), and even then, he left large bones in their fish. The men had other problems in the kitchen; Eddie didn't speak up loud enough and became overwhelmed when his teammates swarmed his station. He also cooked too much pasta at once and used too much pepper in the risotto, causing Ramsay to dismiss it as ''\"inedible\"'' and something he ''\"wouldn't even serve to a fucking pig\"''. Vinnie also met Ramsay's wrath when Ramsay said that Vinnie's dover sole that he was going to bring to the pass was burnt, but Vinnie said it wasn't. When it reached the hot plate the fish was burnt, while Josh undercooked some of the meat courses and tried to obscure this information from Ramsay. Brad took over Eddie's starter station, but that didn't help much because he made an overcooked, peppery risotto that was just as bad as Eddie's. When Josh overcooked a chicken, Ramsay smashed the chicken from the plate. The red team was faced with setbacks, such as Bonnie cooking an order not on the ticket and Joanna getting overwhelmed on garnishes. Under Jen's strong leadership, however, the team worked well, and was able to complete their dinner service. Ramsay (near the end of women's successful service) threw the men out of the kitchen and had the women complete the service for them. After the service, the women were deemed the clear winners, and Ramsay singled out Aaron, Eddie, and Vinnie as the worst of the men's team and singled out Rock as the only good player on his team since he didn't make any mistakes, instructing him to nominate two people for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': Eddie was selected for not being able to handle his station during dinner service and for being the ''\"little man\"'' on the team. Josh was selected because Rock saw him as a person who was all over the place. Josh thought Rock was out to get him. Eddie was ultimately eliminated, something Eddie admitted was his own fault and Aaron was surprised Rock didn't put him up for elimination.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/302.htm Hell's Kitchen \u2013 Episode 3.02 recap], Fox {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617025954/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/302.htm |date=June 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Eddie's got a big heart. Sadly, he couldn't even hold his own section. He made far too many simple mistakes and he didn't merit running his own restaurant.\"\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 25\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n| Title = 10 Chefs Compete\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|6|18}}\n| ShortSummary =\n'''Team challenge''': The teams' challenge was to make breakfast for the [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]]. The winner would be the team that completed their breakfast service first. Julia's short order experience led her team from start to finish almost flawlessly, whereas the men struggled. After the women completed their service, Ramsay requested Julia to help the struggling men's team, commenting on her skills on getting the men together (or in his words, \"''finally'' a leader\").\n\n'''Reward/punishment''':  The women enjoyed a helicopter ride and a meal with Ramsay aboard the [[USS Midway (CV-41)|USS ''Midway'']]. The men's punishment was [[KP duty]], preparing a thousand pounds of potatoes and onions for a military base. Aaron fainted as the men began KP duty and was transported by ambulance to the hospital for treatment. Ramsay instructed the men to have come up with a leader, as their team was suffering without one.\n\n'''Aaron's exit''': Before the Dinner service, Ramsay called a hospitalized Aaron and said he could no longer participate on the show due to his ongoing illness and doctor's orders, making him the 3rd chef to withdraw from Hell's Kitchen, and the 2nd chef to withdraw for medical reasons. After Ramsay finished the telephone conversation with Aaron, he hung up Aaron's jacket and burned his photo.\n\n'''Service''': During prep, the team worried about Julia, as she had admitted she did not know what a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was. Without Aaron and under Brad's leadership, the men got off to a good start with Rock on appetizers but got bogged down with the entrees. At one point, an exasperated Ramsay smashed an egg on Vinnie's chest though the latter managed to restrain himself from retaliating. Brad was trying to scrap the burnt part of the pastry of a beef wellington that he burnt, but Ramsay saw him and said he would shove the wellingtons up his rear-end if he tried to serve them. Josh was accused of trying to sabotage Brad with timing on main courses. The women kept running into problems with appetizers, and didn't complete service. Bonnie sent a raw scallop to the pass which Ramsay caught, though even then Bonnie questioned him on it. Joanna failed to notice that she was using rancid crab, to which Ramsay shouted ''\"You'll kill someone\"'' and fired her from the station. Jen and Julia miscommunicated on spaghetti, leading Jen to bin an order of spaghetti they needed before retrieving it from the bin. Despite Ramsay not noticing, Julia stopped her. The apps were so far backed up in the Red Kitchen that all of Jen's wellingtons got overcooked. In the end, patrons of both kitchens walked out due to the delayed service, and Ramsay crumpled up the orders and ended the service. Neither team won, with Ramsay criticizing Brad's leadership but praising Rock's efforts. The women was chosen the worse of the two, with Ramsay accusing Joanna of being uncaring about the rancid crab, while saying that he could no longer trust Bonnie to properly cook seafood. He instructed all the women to nominate two people for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': The team initially agreed on Joanna and Julia, but when the nominations were being given to Ramsay, Jen admitted she should be nominated instead of Julia. Ramsay called the three women up. When asked, Julia said she should not be eliminated because of her lack of experience, something Ramsay agreed with. Ramsay then immediately sent Julia back in line and told the other two to justify why they should stay. Jen defended herself and admitted her mistake, but Joanna said nothing in her defense and instead said that Jen deserved to go home for considering serving spaghetti from the trash. However, Ramsay instead eliminated Joanna since she actually did serve the rotten crab and refused to accept responsibility for her mistake.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/303.htm Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.03 recap], Fox {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823064015/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/303.htm |date=August 23, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Not only did Joanna serve rancid crab that could've seriously made a customer ill, she completely gave up, screwed her team and if you can't handle one individual section, you got no chance of running a business.\"\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 26\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n| Title = 8 Chefs Compete\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|6|25}}\n| ShortSummary =\n'''Team challenge''': Team members were blindfolded and wore headphones as Ramsay tested their palates with various foods. Julia and Brad went up first, and Julia got two items of food correct while Brad only got one. The next duo were Rock and Melissa, and Rock got two while Melissa got one, leaving the score tied at 3. The next round was Bonnie versus Josh, and Bonnie got two items while Josh got every single one wrong. The last duo was Jen and Vinnie, and with the score at 5-3, Ramsay pre-emptively announced that he would rule in favor of the women in the event of a tie since the men had misidentified so many basic foodstuffs, meaning that the women were guaranteed victory unless Jen missed all her items and Vinnie correctly identified all of his. Vinnie immediately misidentified tuna, and Ramsay declared the women the winners, meaning that Jen didn't even have to taste anything. Afterwards, Vinnie accused Bonnie of cheating due to an incident where her headphones weren't working, even though it was Bonnie herself who had pointed that out. This was the first time in Hell's Kitchen history that the men's team lost the first 3 challenges, this same scenario was later repeated in Seasons 10 and 11.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women were treated to a dining service in the dark with Ramsay. The men had to prepare both kitchens for the next dinner service in addition to eating offal such as cow's tongue, liver and kidney. Rock almost threw up and Brad was worried about the domino effect of throw up if Rock threw up.\n\n'''Service''': For this service, the customers would fill out comment cards on their food, which would decide the winner. Melissa started off moving too quickly ahead appetizers; she tried to push Julia on preparation time even after Julia told her when they would be done. Ramsay commented that this did not show good leadership. Bonnie would not give Ramsay a clear answer on whether or not her chicken was ready. Melissa tried to help Bonnie on meat but she confused Bonnie more than anything. Bonnie had trouble understanding Ramsay's instructions, and over the course of the evening he called her a ''\"stupid cow,\"'' a ''\"dumb blonde,\"'' and a ''\"stupid nanny\"''. Vinnie had trouble with his beef wellingtons and was caught trying to flash grill rare Wellingtons in the oven to make them appear medium. After wasting six Wellingtons and a chicken, the Chef accused him of ''\"not caring.\"'' Josh made risottos that were not cooked the right way, Rock also had to do most of his work on the starter station.

Ramsay warned that if one more dish was brought back from either kitchen, the service would be aborted. After a customer complained of cold chicken, Ramsay smashed the returned dish on the floor, stuck to his promise and shut the kitchen down. While cleaning up, Bonnie had completely cracked under the pressure and wanted to leave the competition, breaking down in tears. Ramsay said while the customers enjoyed most of the food, however, over 65% would not return due to the wait for their food; for this reason, both teams lost. Ramsay picked Jen, though she had not been outstanding, and Rock as the ''\"best of the worst\"'', and strongly suggested that they should choose the teams' weakest members.\n\n'''Elimination''': Jen nominated Melissa and Rock nominated Josh \u2013 Jen nominated Melissa because she had become close friends with Bonnie and Rock chose Josh as a tactical move to keep weaker chefs in the competition. Ramsay immediately saw through this however, and instead called out Vinnie and Bonnie for being the worst performers on the night. After hearing from the two, Ramsay eliminated Vinnie, since Bonnie had at least taken responsibility for her errors, while Vinnie showed no signs of learning from his many mistakes.<ref name=\"Episode 4\"/>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Vinnie talks the talk but he doesn't walk the walk.

The teams were sent to a supermarket and told to buy ingredients for one appetizer, one meat entree and one fish entree in 30 minutes in addition to receiving a $100 budget, with the blue team initially being over the limit and forced to ditch items at the check-out counter. The teams then had one hour to prepare the dishes, with the men managing by consensus, while Melissa tried to take control of the red team's entire menu, to the point where she advised Julia and Jen that they should not listen to Bonnie over her. Just before presenting, Melissa advised Ramsay not to try the red teams dishes, though Ramsay ignored her. The blue team took the point on the appetizer due to the red team's appetizer being too sweet and dessert-like, while the red team's fish entr\u00e9e won out due to the blue team's dish being served with a sauce that the couple hated. On the meat entrees however, the blue team served up a perfectly cooked ribeye steak, while the women served a burnt duck breast with no sides whatsoever; Melissa had put the breast back in the oven after Julia initially cooked it, but then forgot about it and left no time to add sides. Jen was embarrassed to present this, feeling the couple would blame her for Melissa's mistake. Upon seeing the result, Ramsay and the couple didn't even bother tasting the red team's dish and immediately declared the blue team as the clear winners. Before punishment, Melissa got into an argument with her team mates and formed a barrier with them. In a deleted scene, Gordon acknowledged Melissa's rudeness towards Bonnie and told Bonnie that she should have argued with Melissa and stood up for herself.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The men were rewarded was a day of pampering at the Exhale Spa while the red team decorated the dining room for the reception. The women acknowledged that Melissa was their weakest link and that she lost them the challenge.\n\n'''Service''': Both teams would have to serve the three winning dishes from the challenge, and the men were given the privilege of cooking for the wedding couple. Melissa repeatedly cooked the potato dish incorrectly and kept accusing Rock of not teaching her the recipe, so she again earned the wrath of Ramsay, who replaced her with Jen on the potatoes. The women also quickly got agitated with Melissa because she continued to dictate orders. In one instance, Melissa claimed to Bonnie and Jen that she would be four minutes, though when Ramsay asked she said she was ready. Josh initially screwed up on the risotto, which held up Brad's crab and the women, as the wedding couple had to be served first before the rest of the guests. During a moment of inattention, Melissa set down her sabayon, and it promptly fell over in its water bath. She went over to the men's kitchen asking for some of theirs. Upon seeing this, Ramsay yelled at her to get back over to her side and fix it from scratch, accusing her of sabotaging the men. When the wedding planner questioned Jean-Phillipe on why the parents of the bride weren't served, he was directed to Ramsay who promptly told him to get out of the way. The kitchens eventually managed to complete their first service. The women were picked as the losers as the men finished three minutes ahead of them. Ramsay's wedding gift to the couple was a stay at the Green Valley Ranch resort and spa. For the second service in a row, Jen was the women's best of the worst for having a good workload throughout the night.\n\n'''Elimination''': Jen instantly decided on Melissa but then struggled, feeling that neither Bonnie nor Julia had had a bad service that night, and she had become close with both of them. After much consideration, Jen chose Melissa, for her attitude and mouth, and Bonnie, despite her impeccable service, for previous problems. Jen later admitted that Bonnie was only chosen because she would be more likely to be safe than Julia. \n\n'''Team change''': Ramsay told Melissa to give him her coat, but instead of eliminating her, he gave Melissa another chance and she was sent over to the men's team, marking the first time in Hell's Kitchen history where nobody was eliminated. However, Ramsay ended on going to put Melissa's red jacket on the coat hook, but stopping short of actually doing it.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/305.htm Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.05 recap], Fox {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705223727/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/305.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"I've never seen anyone go from being a strong chef to being such a terrible chef so quickly. And that's why tonight I'm giving Melissa one more chance. Her only hope now is that she fits in better with the boys than she did with the girls.\"\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n| Title = 7 Chefs Compete, Part 2\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|7|9}}\n| ShortSummary =\n'''Team challenge''': The two teams were required to make three lobster dishes in one hour. To even out the teams, and in punishment for failing to identify lobster from episode four's taste test, Josh was excluded from the challenge. He was allowed to coach the team, but he is not allowed to touch a lobster. Also, both teams must start with fresh lobsters from a tank, which worries Bonnie. Ramsay takes notice of this and barks at her, at which point she reveals that she does not like to kill living things. She states that ''\"I cry whenever I kill one.\"'' To which Rock retorted ''\"so do the lobsters.\"'' She did, however, overcome this fear, and successfully boiled her own lobster. The first head-to-head was Bonnie vs. Melissa on the salad. Bonnie made a grilled lobster salad with baked apples. Melissa had a citrus herb salad with poached lobster. Bonnie won. The second is Julia vs. Rock. Julia made a lobster risotto. Rock had a buttermilk fried lobster tail. Rock wins. The last is Jen vs. Brad on the bisque. Jen made a lobster and crab bisque. She used some saffron and thyme. Brad had a lobster bisque with [[Disaronno]] chantilly. Ramsay compliments both chefs, but he chooses Jen's and the Red team triumphs. He later mentioned that this was the hardest decision so far.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': Since the blue team lost their challenge, they had to go through the garbage, separating out the recyclables. Rock was visibly angry with the Chef's decision and grumbled that, although he grew up in a poor neighborhood, he thinks this punishment is a bit extreme. Meanwhile, the red team is taken to a photo shoot for ''[[In Touch Weekly|In Touch]]'' magazine. Rock is infuriated about the loss and goes off on a tirade about it, he is singled out for further punishment. He is then summoned to the photo shoot and ordered to separate the recyclables from the trash there as well. Rock felt being singled out for further punishment made him angrier, further complaining about it and boasting about how he never tells his cooks to sort through the trash.\n\n'''Service''': Ramsay informs the teams they will be making familiar dishes such as risotto, sea bass, beef wellington, spaghetti and also featured Bonnie's newly created lobster salad. As punishment for losing, Josh had to fetch lobster for both teams. The red team had an almost flawless performance, their only problems being Bonnie setting a pan on fire and then failing to put it out quickly and Julia initially sending up the wrong order before correcting it, and then breaking down after Bonnie pushed her to complete about another dish. Despite this, they communicated well and got their food out quickly. The blue team did not perform as well, as Melissa's scallops were too thin, Josh's mashed potatoes were gloopy and runny, and Melissa overcooked monkfish causing Ramsay to say it looked like ''\"regurgitated dog shit\"''. Brad also overcooked risotto later on. The blue team struggled on appetizers and an entire table of six sends back their food because their lobster and wellingtons are overcooked. This enraged Ramsay and he ordered the kitchen closed. Ramsay mentioned that the red team had the best dinner service and noted that the blue team, despite having two sous chefs (Josh and Brad), an executive chef (Rock), and a line chef (Melissa), got beaten by a nanny (Bonnie), a short-order cook (Julia) and a pastry chef (Jen). Ramsay then berates Brad for his worst performance yet as well as Josh for being the only one remaining who hasn't had a decent performance.\n\n'''Elimination''': The men agree to put up Melissa for nomination, though struggle between Brad (who was worse that night) and Josh (who had more bad services). Brad pushes to choose nominations on past services (believing Josh had been weaker than him overall). However, Ramsay eliminates Melissa without even asking the men who they chose or asking her to justify why she should stay, on the belief that she had had more chances than anybody, making her the first contestant to be eliminated without being nominated. He then calls up Brad and Josh and threatens to eliminate both of them as well but decides to give them another chance. Ramsay later comments that he was surprised how fast Brad and Josh fell apart.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/306.htm Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.06 recap], Fox {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713072403/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/306.htm |date=July 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"That was really difficult today because Brad and Josh were absolutely horrible. With Melissa, she's very assertive and she sounds like a leader but unfortunately, she doesn't cook like a leader.\"\n\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 29\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n| Title = 6 Chefs Compete\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|7|16}}\n| ShortSummary =\n'''Team challenge''': Each team was given an identical tray of leftovers and instructed to make three courses: one appetizer and two entrees. The winning dishes were judged by Ramsay. Both teams produced equally good appetizers. Brad had curry bass with crustacean tomato pasta. Bonnie started by saying she made rustic tomato, but she sulked and said she made a rustic chicken stew. Chef granted them both a point. Josh and Jen were up next. Jen did a classic take on steak and eggs for breakfast. Josh had the chicken leg and some pea tendril and stuffed inside of the chicken with it. Neither receive a point because Jen's lacked originality and Josh's tasted horrible. Rock and Julia were last up. Rock had surf and turf with a petite ribeye and the pan seared bass. Julia had deep fried sea bass. Julia's [[fish and chips]] which were tasty but not as elegant as Rock's. Ramsay mentioned that it was ''\"just fish and chips\"''. The blue team won the challenge.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The blue team was given the chance to participate in a 3-on-1 [[paintball]] match against Ramsay. They jumped at the chance saying how no one ever got the chance to take out frustrations on their boss. Target practice had pictures of the red team posted. During the competition, Ramsay managed to beat the three men, taking out Brad, then Josh and Rock last. The red team was required to receive, check, and bring in the food delivery for the evening service, with Bonnie in charge of checking/marking the packing slip. Notably, Bonnie missed the fact that unsalted butter and [[turbot]] skeletons were delivered instead of the correct salted butter and turbot filets and then got emotional about it after chastised by the sous chefs. The errors meant that the Red team had to arrange re-delivery of the missing items, working longer than they had expected. Bonnie felt horrible and thought that she would be sent home for her mistakes.\n\n'''Service''': Each team had to create a menu of 3 appetizers, 3 entrees and 3 desserts. The diners were allowed to select from either menu for their meal. During the brainstorming of the menus, Bonnie and Jen took control for the red team while deriding Julia's 'Waffle House background'. The blue team was subjected to Brad's leadership who offered such dishes as 'scallops with horseradish spaetzle' and 'macaroni & cheese done as a cassoulet'. The red team's dishes were mostly standard fare, including Julia's last minute add-on of New York Strip steak and shrimp, while the blue team's dishes were generally fine dining meals created mostly by Brad. Both teams were able to make it through the dinner service, but with significant problems. Ramsay noted the women lacked stamina, and was upset that they refused to communicate with each other, in a contrast to their previous service. Jen had an attitude most the night and kept snapping at Bonnie. Julia begged the girls to keep their service positive while struggling on the last set of entrees in order to make it through. The blue team, led by Brad, had difficulties with a lamb dish and had several plates come back with complaints on Brad's ravioli and then his gravy. While Ramsay was mad at Josh for messing up the lamb, he was also equally mad at Brad and Rock for not helping Josh with the lamb when he struggled, and told them that the customers were suffering because of them. They made Josh get himself out of the mess which slowed them down, but Josh eventually rebounded and managed to successfully serve all of their entrees. Ramsay declared neither team a winner, but noted that Julia was the most consistent chef during the service and that her steak and shrimp dish, while initially rejected by the Red team, turned out to be the most popular without a single order being returned. He had her nominate a player from the Red team for elimination, while he instructed the blue team to come up with a nominee for elimination on their own.\n\n'''Elimination''': Julia selected Bonnie for elimination due to some of the mistakes she had made in service and the way she seems to get flustered during service. Rock and Josh both decided to vote Brad up for elimination, feeling that his leadership was responsible for the failure of their service. Ramsay called Bonnie's name, giving everyone the impression that she was about to be sent home, but he followed that by telling her to ''\"wake up\"'' and then eliminated Brad because while he had stepped up as leader, he only performed \"as a cook\" during the service and attempted to sabotage Josh, which Ramsay considered to be proof that Brad was not a team player.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/307.htm Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.07 recap], Fox {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922153837/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/307.htm |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Brad was a hard worker.

He then told them to go upstairs and put on their black jackets, as they were all now one team.\n\n'''Challenge''': Each chef, individually had to prepare 100 portions of a dish for ''\"trendsetters\"'' with meals planned at least one week in advance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://RanchoRemodeling.com  |title=Two Get Sent Home from 'Fontana kitchen remodeling contractor' |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2007-07-27 |publisher=MSN }}</ref> They later learned the \"trendsetters\" was a high school class at [[Alhambra High School (Alhambra, California)|Alhambra High School]] in [[Alhambra, California]]. Rock made Kobe beef hamburgers, Josh did salmon with pineapple [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]], Jen served baked chicken fettuccine with an herbed butter sauce, Bonnie made fried goat cheese on salad, and Julia prepared a grilled chicken and cheese sandwich with onion rings. Julia won the challenge with 51% of the votes (the DVD release of the season revealed the full results; Rock finished in second place with 25% of the votes, Jen and Bonnie got around 10% each, while Josh did not get a single vote and finished in last place), and her prize was to visit the Green Valley Ranch. She was allowed to pick one chef to go with her and eventually chose Jen. \n\n'''Reward/punishment''': Jen and Julia got a chance to see the Green Valley Ranch Resort, and also went to the Red Rock Resort to meet [[Heather West]], the winner of [[Hell's Kitchen (American season 2)|the second season]] who gave them recipes she had created for her restaurant, and tips for the competition. The other three had to clean the dining room.\n\n'''Service''': During prep, Bonnie threw away monkfish she thought was rancid and MaryAnn quickly berated her, as it was the entire stock of monkfish, and it was in fact fresh. The united black team was tasked with serving all 100 tables in the restaurant. Josh got off to a bad start by cooking risottos and spaghetti ahead of order. Julia forgot to serve garnish for Wellingtons and monkfish and talked back to Ramsay. After one Josh's risottos was returned for being undercooked, he was kicked out and eliminated on the spot, making him the first chef on the show (and the only black jacket to date) to be eliminated during a dinner service (see details below). Even Rock overcooked some scallops early in the service, and Ramsay told him he had hit \"rock-bottom\" after forgetting to cook a turbot. As service continued, Jen and Bonnie performed strongly, but Rock's short temper once again got the best of him; Jen told him to wait before serving scallops, and though he said he would, he then served them, making Jen seem behind. A feud later started during the desserts stage when Jen had asked for Rock to leave some ice cream to her side, only for Rock to ignore her request and slam it on a surface. As a result, Jen called Rock an \"asshole\" and Ramsay had to hit the overhead to break up their argument, to which Rock later admitted privately that he was at fault and apologized to Jen, who forgave him. In the end, the four chefs were able to successfully complete the dinner service.\n\n'''Automatic elimination''': Josh became the first contestant in Hell's Kitchen history to be eliminated mid-service, due to his constant inability to serve a successful appetizer.  First, he cooked too many portions of risotto and spaghetti at once despite Ramsay telling him not to twice, and finally all of the risottos that Josh did manage to get out were sent back because they were undercooked. This brought Ramsay to the end of his patience and he furiously told Josh to take off his jacket and leave. In fact, Josh did not even get a full elimination sequence (i.e., jacket hung on a spike and photo burned). Josh was shown leaving Hell's Kitchen via the delivery entrance, with his bags. Before Season 13, he was also the only black jacket to not receive a retrospective montage upon elimination. In [[Fox Reality]] Channel's ''Reality Revealed'', Josh thought that he wasn't getting kicked off immediately, so Josh turned around and was returning to the kitchen at the same time Ramsay went to the corridor and ordered him to hand over his jacket. If Ramsay never went to the back to see if Josh really left or not, Josh would have gone back into the kitchen and the confrontation would have escalated.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} At the start of episode 10 during a recap of the past episodes, Josh and Julia's pictures were burned side-by-side and their jackets got hooked simultaneously.\n\n'''Elimination''': Chef made it clear that even though Josh was already eliminated, one other chef would still be sent home tonight. Bonnie was declared the best of the service, and had to choose two for elimination. Nominating Rock was predictable as he was disliked by the other three women and had quarreled with both Bonnie and in particular Jen over the night, but Bonnie was uncomfortable with putting up either Jen and Julia, as she had become close to them, mainly as they united against Melissa. Bonnie did get along better with Jen while often arguing with Julia; Julia's weak dinner service further made her vulnerable. Eventually, Julia and Rock were nominated. The choice wasn't easy as Ramsay was visibly troubled by the dilemma of picking between a very driven and talented chef (Rock) and a chef that had grown and exhibited great potential (Julia). In the end, Ramsay eliminated Julia, leaving the other contestants shocked and distraught, in particular Bonnie, who later states how she felt guilty about having Julia eliminated. Though in a break from his usual heavy criticism, Ramsay heaped praise on how far she progressed in spite of her Waffle House background. In an unprecedented move so far on Hell's Kitchen, he said he would personally send Julia to culinary school and invite her to come back and win it all once she has finished.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/308.htm Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.08 recap], Fox {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811215313/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/308.htm |date=August 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"To become a great chef you must have a natural ability. Clearly, Julia does have it. All she needs is a little more experience. After that, she will be ready to run her own restaurant.\"\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 31\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n| Title = 3 Chefs Compete\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|7|30}}\n| ShortSummary = \n'''Challenge''': Ramsay started the challenge by bringing in his mother and having her present her own macaroni and cheese and then producing his own in a more elegant version. He then told each chef to randomly select one of the 5 covered dishes and change it to a gourmet dish. Rock's turned out to be spaghetti, Bonnie's was [[Hot Dog|Franks and Beans]], and Jen's ended up being fried chicken. Bonnie spent a large portion of her time not knowing what Franks and Beans even was. After having 1 hour to complete their dishes Ramsay brought in their mothers to judge. Bonnie did an Italian version of beans and franks, mini bruschettas. She served it with a mushroom cream leek sauce. Rock did what he called a study of spaghetti, there was three different spaghettis. A cream sauce, a veal and a spicy chorizo and pork. Jen did a fried chicken roulade stuffed with crab meat, spinach and goat cheese. All three contestants were in tears at this surprise. Their mothers were seated with their backs to the chefs so that they did not know who made which dish, in order to keep the judging unbiased. Jen won the challenge after all three mothers chose her stuffed fried chicken breasts as the best dish. Bonnie's mother later admitted she knew which one was Bonnie's but voted for Jen's anyway.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': Jen and Ramsay went to lunch with their mothers. Ramsay then dropped her off at a kitchen supply warehouse and gave her $1000 to go shopping with. At the end of the episode, Jen was shown spending almost $300 buying Kasumi steak knives for Bonnie and Rock. Rock and Bonnie had to work together to clean the dormitories where Bonnie complained the whole time. Rock noted that she knew surprisingly little about cleaning for being a professional Nanny. Bonnie admitted that she is really only a \"nanny\" in that she sometimes watches her clients' kids while performing as their personal chef.\n\n'''Service''': Before dinner service, Ramsay had each contestant practice their angriest dressing down to his face. Bonnie noted how satisfying it was to have the rare opportunity to curse at Ramsay for a change. Jen struggled being serious but included many expletives to get her point across. Rock also struggled with coming across effectively. During service, Ramsay made each contestant work the pass, calling out orders and putting the finishing touches on dishes before handing them off to the servers. Ramsay tested each contestant on their leadership, time management, and quality control. He had sous-chefs Scott and Mary Ann deliberately sabotage dishes to see if the contestants would catch the mistakes. Jen was the first to work the pass, where she missed a spaghetti dish that went out without any crab and, as a result, began sending dishes back even though they were edible. Though she recovered her composure and caught an overcooked and underseasoned risotto, her lack of experience was shown in her leadership. She also ran out of risottos near the end of service, due to overcooking the rice. Rock caught a monkfish being sent out without ham, though was criticized for working to slowly plating the dishes and not being vocal enough; Bonnie pointed out that he was an executive chef and should have performed better. Lastly, Bonnie struggled in calling off orders, though spotted an undercooked pigeon and Jen's risotto with no salt, and gained confidence over time. Ramsay praised them all for the best service so far, before instructing them to come up with a reason why they should stay.\n\n'''Elimination''':  All three went back to the dorm and Jen questioned Bonnie's motive for wanting to stay asking her if this is really what she wanted. Jen didn't feel as though this was a serious dream for Bonnie, not helped by the fact that Bonnie admitted she was unsure if she wanted it because of her limited experience. All were called before Ramsay and explained their reasons to stay. Ramsay called Rock's name first, giving everyone the impression that he was about to be sent home, and said that he had made the final two. Ramsay then decided to eliminate Jen but praised her for her talent and determination. Jen's elimination had upset both Bonnie and Rock, as she had become close with both of them, and they both admitted they wanted to see Jen reach the final. After the elimination, Ramsay surprised Rock and Bonnie with a visit from Rock's wife and kids and Bonnie's parents. A tarp rolls down from above, symbolically splitting the restaurant into two sections for the next show.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/309.htm Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.09 recap], Fox {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225042/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/309.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 32\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n| Title = 2 Chefs Compete\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|8|6}}\n| ShortSummary = Before the episode started, Josh's jacket was hung and his picture burned.\n\n'''Remodeling''': As with the previous seasons, Hell's Kitchen is separated into two sides, red side for Bonnie and blue side for Rock. Both chefs begin planning for their side of restaurant, including decor, staff uniforms and menus. Both chefs get to meet an architect which would help them complete what they want for their side of the restaurant, while Jean-Philippe assists both with selection of their servers' uniforms. Bonnie wants to go with a French bistro feel where nothing matches, there are no booths, and servers are required to wear all black. Rock wants a simple black/black design with servers in jeans which Jean-Philippe quickly dismissed. Bonnie's menu is reflective of her favorite dishes with her signature dish being her Prawn Fettuccine while Rock's is based on southern food with his [[Surf and turf]] of fried chicken and crab cakes as his starter. Bonnie seemed to flow with ideas about her restaurant while Rock struggled with deciding on most of the aspects.\n\n'''Challenge''': After they have selected their restaurant's decor, the two chefs travel to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with Ramsay on a private plane and are given a tour of the Green Valley Ranch Resort.  In a surprise challenge, Ramsay tells the final two they have thirty minutes to create their specialty dish (listed above) and present it to the top chefs of Las Vegas. The dishes are judged by seven judges, including other chefs from Las Vegas restaurants, [[Robin Leach]], seasons one and two Hell's Kitchen winners [[Hell's Kitchen (American season 1)|Michael Wray]] and [[Hell's Kitchen (American season 2)|Heather West]], respectively, and the duo of the owner and head chef of the Green Valley Ranch Resort who cast the deciding vote. Bonnie won the challenge four votes to three.\n\nThe last six eliminated chefs Julia, Jen, Brad, Josh, Melissa and Vinnie were reunited with the final two. Julia was very emotional, struggling with the disappointment of not making it to the finale, plus the fact that Bonnie chose Julia over Jen to be up on the chopping block in the first place. Julia privately admitted that she was rooting for Rock, though stated she was not going to let this ruin her dinner service. Rock and Bonnie chose their team for the season finale, with Bonnie selecting first for winning the previous challenge. Bonnie chooses Jen, Melissa, and Julia, while Rock chooses Brad, Vinnie, and Josh. Julia was bitter over Bonnie choosing Melissa before herself, though Bonnie admitted she only did so as Julia may hinder the team by being emotional. Rock passed over Julia knowing he would end up with Josh, saying that he understood Josh and more importantly because Julia's feelings could be a liability even though he considered her better than Josh. In the end, both retain the same team members they had from the start of the season, resulting in all-male and all-female teams. However, this episode ended with [[cliffhanger|a cliffhanger of sorts]].<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/310.htm Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.10 recap], Fox {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204523/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/310.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 33\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 11\n| Title = Winner Announced\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|8|13}}\n| ShortSummary =\n'''Preparations''': Continuing from previous episode, Rock organized his team well while Bonnie took a relaxed laid back approach, admitting she had not cooked most of her items. In the kitchen while planning recipes, Julia frequently snapped at Bonnie, while Rock convinced Josh that he is capable and just needs self-confidence to perform well. The two finalists presented their appetizers and entrees to Ramsay; Bonnie's goat cheese salad and her signature prawn fettuccine, Rock's [[surf and turf]] (fried chicken and crabcakes) and rib eye steak. Ramsay tells Bonnie that her chocolate truffle assortment is on the small side, while advising Rock to serve his milkshake (and cookies) in martini glasses instead of a huge tall glass. Ramsay then toured their halves of the restaurant asking for their redesign explanations and had no complaints. Before service starts, Ramsay presents Bonnie and Rock with their own head chef's jackets.\n\n'''Service''':  Rock's team struggled early with Josh constantly burning the crab cakes and putting them 30 minutes behind. After a warning from Ramsay that Josh was ruining everything, Rock made a decisive move and switched Josh and Vinnie's positions, and from then on there were no more major problems. Rock pledged that he would work every station to make the food perfect and even started cooking dishes himself when the others couldn't handle. Bonnie's team started out strong on the appetizers, but Melissa overcooked the prawns. However, they were soon plagued by lack of communications, particularly as Jen and especially Julia didn't take Bonnie seriously, and an emotional Julia defied orders which, in turn, led to Bonnie tuning her out. After two orders of fettucine were returned for being undercooked and cold, Bonnie realized that they had ran out of prawns due to portion mismanagement and had no other seafood ready to go, forcing her to send out the rest of the orders with only pasta. Dessert went smoothly for both sides.\n\n'''Winner''':  During the debrief, Ramsay asked each chef what they would have changed. Rock stated that he would have won the challenge to get Jen with the first pick, complimenting her cooking skills (which made Jen feel honored), while saying that Josh ''\"really screwed up\"'' and would have been left off his team (which slightly angered Josh). Bonnie admitted that she was not careful in monitoring portion sizes and thus ran out of ingredients. Ramsay had no substantial criticism for either chef, only saying that ''\"You both came out with leadership qualities\"'', noting that Bonnie has improved her assertiveness while Rock was considered ''\"rock-solid\"''. Ramsay considered all aspects in making his decision, including how each chef ran the kitchen and ''every'' customer feedback card. Both Rock and Bonnie stood in front of the two doors and whoever's door opened would be the winner. Rock broke down in tears when his door opened and was declared the winner of ''Hell's Kitchen'' Season 3, and Bonnie immediately went to congratulate him.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/311.htm Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.11 recap], Fox {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204550/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/311.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Rock deserved to win Hell's Kitchen because he's a very confident cook and he has become a really good leader.

In October 2018, eleven years after the season's original airing, fellow contestant Joanna Dunn revealed via [[Facebook]] that producers had discovered he was spreading salacious rumors about her to other contestants, disqualified him immediately afterwards, and subsequently scrapped almost all footage of him. Despite this, he can still be seen briefly in several frames of the first episode (although he disappears shortly thereafter), and his burned picture can still be seen next to Joanna's when she is eliminated. Many uncertainties still remain concerning J.R., such as when exactly he left the set or presented his signature dish, if he even did so at all.

The episode opened with [[Gordon Ramsay]] seated at a table in the restaurant, telling viewers he was going to be nicer this time around. After a few seconds, he admitted he was joking. The contestants arrived, and ma\u00eetre d\u2019 Jean Philippe Susilovic began to brief the chefs, until Ramsay interrupted, instructing the contestants to get to the kitchen and prepare their ''\"signature dish\"''.\n\n'''Signature dishes''': Each contestant prepared their signature dish for evaluation by Ramsay. He declared Melissa's peppered steak and asparagus and Tiffany's seafood tostada as the best. He also had some praise for Julia and Aaron's dishes, but felt that Julia's dish was spoiled by an excessive amount of pepper, and that Aaron had over-complicated his [[finger food]] dish with a needless amount of garnishes. Ramsay was also initially impressed with Rock's scallop and gnocchi dish but refused to eat it when he learned that the gnocchi was frozen as Rock did not have enough time to it from scratch - even then, he stated it could've been a great dish. The remaining dishes were all felt to be generally unimpressive. Ramsay found Vinnie's dish too spicy and disappointing with Vinnie revealing an open disagreement and lead to Ramsay saying to himself out loud \"What a fucking jerk!\", Joanna's dish was dry and salty, Josh's foie gras was too undercooked and salty and Ramsay could recognize Bonnie's lack of experience with her cheese platter. Brad and Eddie both made under-par scallop dishes and Ramsay was aggravated when Brad thought Eddie's scallops were \"cooked right\" since Ramsay found the scallops raw, Eddie (whilst thinking Brad's dish wasn't bad) felt the vanilla ruined it for him and Jen's pancake was too thick and there was too much alcohol in her dish as well.\n\n'''Pre-Service''': Whilst Brad got the team organised during prep, Aaron however struggled to prep the ice cream with Rock showing him how to prep it. The women completely isolated Julia due to her being a waffle house cook, even though she tried to help. To make matters worse, Joanna attempted to dictate over the team and annoyed the women (and Bonnie in particular) for telling them that they were incorrectly prepping the stock for service when they were actually doing it the right way. Sous chef MaryAnn even showed worries for the upcoming service due to Joanna's horrific leadership.\n\n'''Service''': Before service, Julia told Ramsay that she didn't think the team was ready, but Joanna and Tiffany reassured him that they were. Aaron also became over-emotional before service, forcing Ramsay to calm him down and holding up the restaurant's opening. In the service, Vinnie couldn't successfully cook any appetizers for the blue team, and was thrown off the station for using water rather than vegetable stock, he instead resorted to cleaning dishes. Brad got the remaining appetizers out without any trouble, but Aaron had trouble on the meat and had to leave service because he felt exhausted, whilst Ramsay had to again calm him down. Josh took over the station, but found out that Aaron had overcooked the team's entire supply of chicken, making it impossible for the team to proceed in service. The red team also had trouble on the appetizers, as both Tiffany and Bonnie failed to cook eggs for the scallops, while Joanna repeatedly berated and insulted Julia when she tried to help. When Julia broke down because her team refused to let her help, Ramsay ordered Julia and Melissa to take over the appetizers, after which they were able to get some of the appetizers out, though progress was still slow due to Joanna continuing to argue with the other women. After seeing this, Ramsay shut the service down. During the post-mortem Ramsay asked Vinnie a question about his performance, to which Vinnie blamed Ramsay for his lack of direction. Ramsay called him a \"two-faced lazy little fucker\", which angers Vinnie and he replies saying \"Lazy!?\". Ramsay declared the blue team as the winners since they at least served all their appetizers, while the red team, now dubbed \"Hell's Bitches\" for their in-fighting, couldn't even manage that. Melissa, who had stepped up as a leader, was named the red team's best of the worst and told to nominate two women for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': Melissa nominated Joanna for her bad attitude, and Tiffany for not getting any appetizers out. The two had tried to persuade her to nominate Julia for not having professional experience, but she ignored them, feeling Julia had managed to successfully get out appetizers and was at least a good team player, whereas they had failed at both. Ramsay eliminated Tiffany for making too many basic mistakes.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/301.htm Fox.com - Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.01 recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604170345/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/301.htm |date=June 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"To be a great chef, you need great attention to detail, passion and great work ethic.

While bringing the fish in, Aaron claimed to suffer from cramps and Ramsay excused him from the challenge, automatically balancing out the teams. The teams had 30 minutes to carefully remove the skin and extract the roe from as many fishes as possible; Ramsay inspected each one and made a pass/fail determination. The men were let down by Vinnie having neglected to prepare any correctly, though Josh, Brad, Eddie and Rock pulled the score up to eight. Melissa single-handedly earned half of this by having four acceptable servings, while Julia had two. Despite Jen and Bonnie failing to earn any and Joanna having only prepared three, all three of hers were acceptable, leading to a victory for the women.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women spent the day fishing with Ramsay. The men prepared the remaining sole for the dinner service.\n\n'''Service''':  Ramsay instructed Aaron to work in the dining room by deboning the dover sole when served, which was the men's 2nd part of the punishment, though during preparation, he showed signs he may not be able to continue during service. Despite his apparent well-being later on, he was found to be talking to diners, taking too long to prepare the fish (to the point where it was cold and sent back), and even then, he left large bones in their fish. The men had other problems in the kitchen; Eddie didn't speak up loud enough and became overwhelmed when his teammates swarmed his station. He also cooked too much pasta at once and used too much pepper in the risotto, causing Ramsay to dismiss it as ''\"inedible\"'' and something he ''\"wouldn't even serve to a fucking pig\"''. Vinnie also met Ramsay's wrath when Ramsay said that Vinnie's dover sole that he was going to bring to the pass was burnt, but Vinnie said it wasn't. When it reached the hot plate the fish was burnt, while Josh undercooked some of the meat courses and tried to obscure this information from Ramsay. Brad took over Eddie's starter station, but that didn't help much because he made an overcooked, peppery risotto that was just as bad as Eddie's. When Josh overcooked a chicken, Ramsay smashed the chicken from the plate. The red team was faced with setbacks, such as Bonnie cooking an order not on the ticket and Joanna getting overwhelmed on garnishes. Under Jen's strong leadership, however, the team worked well, and was able to complete their dinner service. Ramsay (near the end of women's successful service) threw the men out of the kitchen and had the women complete the service for them. After the service, the women were deemed the clear winners, and Ramsay singled out Aaron, Eddie, and Vinnie as the worst of the men's team and singled out Rock as the only good player on his team since he didn't make any mistakes, instructing him to nominate two people for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': Eddie was selected for not being able to handle his station during dinner service and for being the ''\"little man\"'' on the team. Josh was selected because Rock saw him as a person who was all over the place. Josh thought Rock was out to get him. Eddie was ultimately eliminated, something Eddie admitted was his own fault and Aaron was surprised Rock didn't put him up for elimination.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/302.htm Fox.com - Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.02 recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070617025954/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/302.htm |date=June 17, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Eddie's got a big heart.

The winner would be the team that completed their breakfast service first. Julia's short order experience led her team from start to finish almost flawlessly, whereas the men struggled. After the women completed their service, Ramsay requested Julia to help the struggling men's team, commenting on her skills on getting the men together (or in his words, \"''finally'' a leader\").\n\n'''Reward/punishment''':  The women enjoyed a helicopter ride and a meal with Ramsay aboard the [[USS Midway (CV-41)|USS ''Midway'']]. The men's punishment was [[KP duty]], preparing a thousand pounds of potatoes and onions for a military base. Aaron fainted as the men began KP duty and was transported by ambulance to the hospital for treatment. Ramsay instructed the men to have come up with a leader, as their team was suffering without one.\n\n'''Aaron's exit''': Before the Dinner service, Ramsay called a hospitalized Aaron and said he could no longer participate on the show due to his ongoing illness and doctor's orders, making him the 3rd chef to withdraw from Hell's Kitchen, and the 2nd chef to withdraw for medical reasons. After Ramsay finished the telephone conversation with Aaron, he hung up Aaron's jacket and burned his photo.\n\n'''Service''': During prep, the team worried about Julia, as she had admitted she did not know what a cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e was. Without Aaron and under Brad's leadership, the men got off to a good start with Rock on appetizers but got bogged down with the entrees. At one point, an exasperated Ramsay smashed an egg on Vinnie's chest though the latter managed to restrain himself from retaliating. Brad was trying to scrap the burnt part of the pastry of a beef wellington that he burnt, but Ramsay saw him and said he would shove the wellingtons up his rear-end if he tried to serve them. Josh was accused of trying to sabotage Brad with timing on main courses. The women kept running into problems with appetizers, and didn't complete service. Bonnie sent a raw scallop to the pass which Ramsay caught, though even then Bonnie questioned him on it. Joanna failed to notice that she was using rancid crab, to which Ramsay shouted ''\"You'll kill someone\"'' and fired her from the station. Jen and Julia miscommunicated on spaghetti, leading Jen to bin an order of spaghetti they needed before retrieving it from the bin. Despite Ramsay not noticing, Julia stopped her. The apps were so far backed up in the Red Kitchen that all of Jen's wellingtons got overcooked. In the end, patrons of both kitchens walked out due to the delayed service, and Ramsay crumpled up the orders and ended the service. Neither team won, with Ramsay criticizing Brad's leadership but praising Rock's efforts. The women was chosen the worse of the two, with Ramsay accusing Joanna of being uncaring about the rancid crab, while saying that he could no longer trust Bonnie to properly cook seafood. He instructed all the women to nominate two people for elimination.\n\n'''Elimination''': The team initially agreed on Joanna and Julia, but when the nominations were being given to Ramsay, Jen admitted she should be nominated instead of Julia. Ramsay called the three women up. When asked, Julia said she should not be eliminated because of her lack of experience, something Ramsay agreed with. Ramsay then immediately sent Julia back in line and told the other two to justify why they should stay. Jen defended herself and admitted her mistake, but Joanna said nothing in her defense and instead said that Jen deserved to go home for considering serving spaghetti from the trash. However, Ramsay instead eliminated Joanna since she actually did serve the rotten crab and refused to accept responsibility for her mistake.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/303.htm Fox.com - Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.03 recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823064015/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/303.htm |date=August 23, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Not only did Joanna serve rancid crab that could've seriously made a customer ill, she completely gave up, screwed her team and if you can't handle one individual section, you got no chance of running a business.\"\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 26\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n| Title = 8 Chefs Compete\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|6|25}}\n| ShortSummary =\n'''Team challenge''': Team members were blindfolded and wore headphones as Ramsay tested their palates with various foods. Julia and Brad went up first, and Julia got two items of food correct while Brad only got one. The next duo were Rock and Melissa, and Rock got two while Melissa got one, leaving the score tied at 3. The next round was Bonnie versus Josh, and Bonnie got two items while Josh got every single one wrong. The last duo was Jen and Vinnie, and with the score at 5-3, Ramsay pre-emptively announced that he would rule in favor of the women in the event of a tie since the men had misidentified so many basic foodstuffs, meaning that the women were guaranteed victory unless Jen missed all her items and Vinnie correctly identified all of his. Vinnie immediately misidentified tuna, and Ramsay declared the women the winners, meaning that Jen didn't even have to taste anything. Afterwards, Vinnie accused Bonnie of cheating due to an incident where her headphones weren't working, even though it was Bonnie herself who had pointed that out. This was the first time in Hell's Kitchen history that the men's team lost the first 3 challenges, this same scenario was later repeated in Seasons 10 and 11.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The women were treated to a dining service in the dark with Ramsay. The men had to prepare both kitchens for the next dinner service in addition to eating offal such as cow's tongue, liver and kidney. Rock almost threw up and Brad was worried about the domino effect of throw up if Rock threw up.\n\n'''Service''': For this service, the customers would fill out comment cards on their food, which would decide the winner. Melissa started off moving too quickly ahead appetizers; she tried to push Julia on preparation time even after Julia told her when they would be done. Ramsay commented that this did not show good leadership. Bonnie would not give Ramsay a clear answer on whether or not her chicken was ready. Melissa tried to help Bonnie on meat but she confused Bonnie more than anything. Bonnie had trouble understanding Ramsay's instructions, and over the course of the evening he called her a ''\"stupid cow,\"'' a ''\"dumb blonde,\"'' and a ''\"stupid nanny\"''. Vinnie had trouble with his beef wellingtons and was caught trying to flash grill rare Wellingtons in the oven to make them appear medium. After wasting six Wellingtons and a chicken, the Chef accused him of ''\"not caring.\"'' Josh made risottos that were not cooked the right way, Rock also had to do most of his work on the starter station. Josh wasn't convinced when a customer sent back his spaghetti for being undercooked.<ref name=\"Episode 4\">[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/304.htm Fox.com - Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.04 recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629185352/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/304.htm |date=June 29, 2007 }}</ref> Both kitchens had numerous dishes returned due to poor quality. Ramsay warned that if one more dish was brought back from either kitchen, the service would be aborted. After a customer complained of cold chicken, Ramsay smashed the returned dish on the floor, stuck to his promise and shut the kitchen down. While cleaning up, Bonnie had completely cracked under the pressure and wanted to leave the competition, breaking down in tears. Ramsay said while the customers enjoyed most of the food, however, over 65% would not return due to the wait for their food; for this reason, both teams lost. Ramsay picked Jen, though she had not been outstanding, and Rock as the ''\"best of the worst\"'', and strongly suggested that they should choose the teams' weakest members.\n\n'''Elimination''': Jen nominated Melissa and Rock nominated Josh - Jen nominated Melissa because she had become close friends with Bonnie and Rock chose Josh as a tactical move to keep weaker chefs in the competition. Ramsay immediately saw through this however, and instead called out Vinnie and Bonnie for being the worst performers on the night. After hearing from the two, Ramsay eliminated Vinnie, since Bonnie had at least taken responsibility for her errors, while Vinnie showed no signs of learning from his many mistakes.<ref name=\"Episode 4\"/>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Vinnie talks the talk but he doesn't walk the walk.

The teams were sent to a supermarket and told to buy ingredients for one appetizer, one meat entree and one fish entree in 30 minutes in addition to receiving a $100 budget, with the blue team initially being over the limit and forced to ditch items at the check-out counter. The teams then had one hour to prepare the dishes, with the men managing by consensus, while Melissa tried to take control of the red team's entire menu, to the point where she advised Julia and Jen that they should not listen to Bonnie over her. Just before presenting, Melissa advised Ramsay not to try the red teams dishes, though Ramsay ignored her. The blue team took the point on the appetizer due to the red team's appetizer being too sweet and dessert-like, while the red team's fish entr\u00e9e won out due to the blue team's dish being served with a sauce that the couple hated. On the meat entrees however, the blue team served up a perfectly cooked ribeye steak, while the women served a burnt duck breast with no sides whatsoever; Melissa had put the breast back in the oven after Julia initially cooked it, but then forgot about it and left no time to add sides. Jen was embarrassed to present this, feeling the couple would blame her for Melissa's mistake. Upon seeing the result, Ramsay and the couple didn't even bother tasting the red team's dish and immediately declared the blue team as the clear winners. Before punishment, Melissa got into an argument with her team mates and formed a barrier with them. In a deleted scene, Gordon acknowledged Melissa's rudeness towards Bonnie and told Bonnie that she should have argued with Melissa and stood up for herself.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The men were rewarded was a day of pampering at the Exhale Spa while the red team decorated the dining room for the reception. The women acknowledged that Melissa was their weakest link and that she lost them the challenge.\n\n'''Service''': Both teams would have to serve the three winning dishes from the challenge, and the men were given the privilege of cooking for the wedding couple. Melissa repeatedly cooked the potato dish incorrectly and kept accusing Rock of not teaching her the recipe, so she again earned the wrath of Ramsay, who replaced her with Jen on the potatoes. The women also quickly got agitated with Melissa because she continued to dictate orders. In one instance, Melissa claimed to Bonnie and Jen that she would be four minutes, though when Ramsay asked she said she was ready. Josh initially screwed up on the risotto, which held up Brad's crab and the women, as the wedding couple had to be served first before the rest of the guests. During a moment of inattention, Melissa set down her sabayon, and it promptly fell over in its water bath. She went over to the men's kitchen asking for some of theirs. Upon seeing this, Ramsay yelled at her to get back over to her side and fix it from scratch, accusing her of sabotaging the men. When the wedding planner questioned Jean-Phillipe on why the parents of the bride weren't served, he was directed to Ramsay who promptly told him to get out of the way. The kitchens eventually managed to complete their first service. The women were picked as the losers as the men finished three minutes ahead of them. Ramsay's wedding gift to the couple was a stay at the Green Valley Ranch resort and spa. For the second service in a row, Jen was the women's best of the worst for having a good workload throughout the night.\n\n'''Elimination''': Jen instantly decided on Melissa but then struggled, feeling that neither Bonnie nor Julia had had a bad service that night, and she had become close with both of them. After much consideration, Jen chose Melissa, for her attitude and mouth, and Bonnie, despite her impeccable service, for previous problems. Jen later admitted that Bonnie was only chosen because she would be more likely to be safe than Julia. \n\n'''Team change''': Ramsay told Melissa to give him her coat, but instead of eliminating her, he gave Melissa another chance and she was sent over to the men's team, marking the first time in Hell's Kitchen history where nobody was eliminated. However, Ramsay ended on going to put Melissa's red jacket on the coat hook, but stopping short of actually doing it.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/305.htm Fox.com - Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.05 recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705223727/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/305.htm |date=July 5, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"I've never seen anyone go from being a strong chef to being such a terrible chef so quickly. And that's why tonight I'm giving Melissa one more chance.

To even out the teams, and in punishment for failing to identify lobster from episode four's taste test, Josh was excluded from the challenge. He was allowed to coach the team, but he is not allowed to touch a lobster. Also, both teams must start with fresh lobsters from a tank, which worries Bonnie. Ramsay takes notice of this and barks at her, at which point she reveals that she does not like to kill living things. She states that ''\"I cry whenever I kill one.\"'' To which Rock retorted ''\"so do the lobsters.\"'' She did, however, overcome this fear, and successfully boiled her own lobster. The first head-to-head was Bonnie vs. Melissa on the salad. Bonnie made a grilled lobster salad with baked apples. Melissa had a citrus herb salad with poached lobster. Bonnie won. The second is Julia vs. Rock. Julia made a lobster risotto. Rock had a buttermilk fried lobster tail. Rock wins. The last is Jen vs. Brad on the bisque. Jen made a lobster and crab bisque. She used some saffron and thyme. Brad had a lobster bisque with [[Disaronno]] chantilly. Ramsay compliments both chefs, but he chooses Jen's and the Red team triumphs. He later mentioned that this was the hardest decision so far.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': Since the blue team lost their challenge, they had to go through the garbage, separating out the recyclables. Rock was visibly angry with the Chef's decision and grumbled that, although he grew up in a poor neighborhood, he thinks this punishment is a bit extreme. Meanwhile, the red team is taken to a photo shoot for ''[[In Touch Weekly|In Touch]]'' magazine. Rock is infuriated about the loss and goes off on a tirade about it, he is singled out for further punishment. He is then summoned to the photo shoot and ordered to separate the recyclables from the trash there as well. Rock felt being singled out for further punishment made him angrier, further complaining about it and boasting about how he never tells his cooks to sort through the trash.\n\n'''Service''': Ramsay informs the teams they will be making familiar dishes such as risotto, sea bass, beef wellington, spaghetti and also featured Bonnie's newly created lobster salad. As punishment for losing, Josh had to fetch lobster for both teams. The red team had an almost flawless performance, their only problems being Bonnie setting a pan on fire and then failing to put it out quickly and Julia initially sending up the wrong order before correcting it, and then breaking down after Bonnie pushed her to complete about another dish. Despite this, they communicated well and got their food out quickly. The blue team did not perform as well, as Melissa's scallops were too thin, Josh's mashed potatoes were gloopy and runny, and Melissa overcooked monkfish causing Ramsay to say it looked like ''\"regurgitated dog shit\"''. Brad also overcooked risotto later on. The blue team struggled on appetizers and an entire table of six sends back their food because their lobster and wellingtons are overcooked. This enraged Ramsay and he ordered the kitchen closed. Ramsay mentioned that the red team had the best dinner service and noted that the blue team, despite having two sous chefs (Josh and Brad), an executive chef (Rock), and a line chef (Melissa), got beaten by a nanny (Bonnie), a short-order cook (Julia) and a pastry chef (Jen). Ramsay then berates Brad for his worst performance yet as well as Josh for being the only one remaining who hasn't had a decent performance.\n\n'''Elimination''': The men agree to put up Melissa for nomination, though struggle between Brad (who was worse that night) and Josh (who had more bad services). Brad pushes to choose nominations on past services (believing Josh had been weaker than him overall). However, Ramsay eliminates Melissa without even asking the men who they chose or asking her to justify why she should stay, on the belief that she had had more chances than anybody, making her the first contestant to be eliminated without being nominated. He then calls up Brad and Josh and threatens to eliminate both of them as well but decides to give them another chance. Ramsay later comments that he was surprised how fast Brad and Josh fell apart.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/306.htm Fox.com - Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.06 recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713072403/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/306.htm |date=July 13, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"That was really difficult today because Brad and Josh were absolutely horrible. With Melissa, she's very assertive and she sounds like a leader but unfortunately, she doesn't cook like a leader.\"\n\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 29\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n| Title = 6 Chefs Compete\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|7|16}}\n| ShortSummary =\n'''Team challenge''': Each team was given an identical tray of leftovers and instructed to make three courses: one appetizer and two entrees. The winning dishes were judged by Ramsay. Both teams produced equally good appetizers. Brad had curry bass with crustacean tomato pasta. Bonnie started by saying she made rustic tomato, but she sulked and said she made a rustic chicken stew. Chef granted them both a point. Josh and Jen were up next. Jen did a classic take on steak and eggs for breakfast. Josh had the chicken leg and some pea tendril and stuffed inside of the chicken with it. Neither receive a point because Jen's lacked originality and Josh's tasted horrible. Rock and Julia were last up. Rock had surf and turf with a petite ribeye and the pan seared bass. Julia had deep fried sea bass. Julia's [[fish and chips]] which were tasty but not as elegant as Rock's. Ramsay mentioned that it was ''\"just fish and chips\"''. The blue team won the challenge.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': The blue team was given the chance to participate in a 3-on-1 [[paintball]] match against Ramsay. They jumped at the chance saying how no one ever got the chance to take out frustrations on their boss. Target practice had pictures of the red team posted. During the competition, Ramsay managed to beat the three men, taking out Brad, then Josh and Rock last. The red team was required to receive, check, and bring in the food delivery for the evening service, with Bonnie in charge of checking/marking the packing slip. Notably, Bonnie missed the fact that unsalted butter and [[turbot]] skeletons were delivered instead of the correct salted butter and turbot filets and then got emotional about it after chastised by the sous chefs. The errors meant that the Red team had to arrange re-delivery of the missing items, working longer than they had expected. Bonnie felt horrible and thought that she would be sent home for her mistakes.\n\n'''Service''': Each team had to create a menu of 3 appetizers, 3 entrees and 3 desserts. The diners were allowed to select from either menu for their meal. During the brainstorming of the menus, Bonnie and Jen took control for the red team while deriding Julia's 'Waffle House background'. The blue team was subjected to Brad's leadership who offered such dishes as 'scallops with horseradish spaetzle' and 'macaroni & cheese done as a cassoulet'. The red team's dishes were mostly standard fare, including Julia's last minute add-on of New York Strip steak and shrimp, while the blue team's dishes were generally fine dining meals created mostly by Brad. Both teams were able to make it through the dinner service, but with significant problems. Ramsay noted the women lacked stamina, and was upset that they refused to communicate with each other, in a contrast to their previous service. Jen had an attitude most the night and kept snapping at Bonnie. Julia begged the girls to keep their service positive while struggling on the last set of entrees in order to make it through. The blue team, led by Brad, had difficulties with a lamb dish and had several plates come back with complaints on Brad's ravioli and then his gravy. While Ramsay was mad at Josh for messing up the lamb, he was also equally mad at Brad and Rock for not helping Josh with the lamb when he struggled, and told them that the customers were suffering because of them. They made Josh get himself out of the mess which slowed them down, but Josh eventually rebounded and managed to successfully serve all of their entrees. Ramsay declared neither team a winner, but noted that Julia was the most consistent chef during the service and that her steak and shrimp dish, while initially rejected by the Red team, turned out to be the most popular without a single order being returned. He had her nominate a player from the Red team for elimination, while he instructed the blue team to come up with a nominee for elimination on their own.\n\n'''Elimination''': Julia selected Bonnie for elimination due to some of the mistakes she had made in service and the way she seems to get flustered during service. Rock and Josh both decided to vote Brad up for elimination, feeling that his leadership was responsible for the failure of their service. Ramsay called Bonnie's name, giving everyone the impression that she was about to be sent home, but he followed that by telling her to ''\"wake up\"'' and then eliminated Brad because while he had stepped up as leader, he only performed \"as a cook\" during the service and attempted to sabotage Josh, which Ramsay considered to be proof that Brad was not a team player.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/307.htm Fox.com - Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.07 recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922153837/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/307.htm |date=September 22, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Brad was a hard worker.

He then told them to go upstairs and put on their black jackets, as they were all now one team.\n\n'''Challenge''': Each chef, individually had to prepare 100 portions of a dish for ''\"trendsetters\"'' with meals planned at least one week in advance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://RanchoRemodeling.com  |title=Two Get Sent Home from 'Fontana kitchen remodeling contractor' |date=2007-07-24 |accessdate=2007-07-27 |publisher=MSN }}</ref> They later learned the \"trendsetters\" was a high school class at [[Alhambra High School (Alhambra, California)|Alhambra High School]] in [[Alhambra, California]]. Rock made Kobe beef hamburgers, Josh did salmon with pineapple [[Salsa (sauce)|salsa]], Jen served baked chicken fettuccine with an herbed butter sauce, Bonnie made fried goat cheese on salad, and Julia prepared a grilled chicken and cheese sandwich with onion rings. Julia won the challenge with 51% of the votes (the DVD release of the season revealed the full results; Rock finished in second place with 25% of the votes, Jen and Bonnie got around 10% each, while Josh did not get a single vote and finished in last place), and her prize was to visit the Green Valley Ranch. She was allowed to pick one chef to go with her and eventually chose Jen. \n\n'''Reward/punishment''': Jen and Julia got a chance to see the Green Valley Ranch Resort, and also went to the Red Rock Resort to meet [[Heather West]], the winner of [[Hell's Kitchen (American season 2)|the second season]] who gave them recipes she had created for her restaurant, and tips for the competition. The other three had to clean the dining room.\n\n'''Service''': During prep, Bonnie threw away monkfish she thought was rancid and MaryAnn quickly berated her, as it was the entire stock of monkfish, and it was in fact fresh. The united black team was tasked with serving all 100 tables in the restaurant. Josh got off to a bad start by cooking risottos and spaghetti ahead of order. Julia forgot to serve garnish for Wellingtons and monkfish and talked back to Ramsay. After one Josh's risottos was returned for being undercooked, he was kicked out and eliminated on the spot, making him the first chef on the show (and the only black jacket to date) to be eliminated during a dinner service (see details below). Even Rock overcooked some scallops early in the service, and Ramsay told him he had hit \"rock-bottom\" after forgetting to cook a turbot. As service continued, Jen and Bonnie performed strongly, but Rock's short temper once again got the best of him; Jen told him to wait before serving scallops, and though he said he would, he then served them, making Jen seem behind. A feud later started during the desserts stage when Jen had asked for Rock to leave some ice cream to her side, only for Rock to ignore her request and slam it on a surface. As a result, Jen called Rock an \"asshole\" and Ramsay had to hit the overhead to break up their argument, to which Rock later admitted privately that he was at fault and apologized to Jen, who forgave him. In the end, the four chefs were able to successfully complete the dinner service.\n\n'''Automatic elimination''': Josh became the first contestant in Hell's Kitchen history to be eliminated mid-service, due to his constant inability to serve a successful appetizer.  First, he cooked too many portions of risotto and spaghetti at once despite Ramsay telling him not to twice, and finally all of the risottos that Josh did manage to get out were sent back because they were undercooked. This brought Ramsay to the end of his patience and he furiously told Josh to take off his jacket and leave. In fact, Josh did not even get a full elimination sequence (i.e., jacket hung on a spike and photo burned). Josh was shown leaving Hell's Kitchen via the delivery entrance, with his bags. Before Season 13, he was also the only black jacket to not receive a retrospective montage upon elimination. In [[Fox Reality]] Channel's ''Reality Revealed'', Josh thought that he wasn't getting kicked off immediately, so Josh turned around and was returning to the kitchen at the same time Ramsay went to the corridor and ordered him to hand over his jacket. If Ramsay never went to the back to see if Josh really left or not, Josh would have gone back into the kitchen and the confrontation would have escalated.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} At the start of episode 10 during a recap of the past episodes, Josh and Julia's pictures were burned side-by-side and their jackets got hooked simultaneously.\n\n'''Elimination''': Chef made it clear that even though Josh was already eliminated, one other chef would still be sent home tonight. Bonnie was declared the best of the service, and had to choose two for elimination. Nominating Rock was predictable as he was disliked by the other three women and had quarreled with both Bonnie and in particular Jen over the night, but Bonnie was uncomfortable with putting up either Jen and Julia, as she had become close to them, mainly as they united against Melissa. Bonnie did get along better with Jen while often arguing with Julia; Julia's weak dinner service further made her vulnerable. Eventually, Julia and Rock were nominated. The choice wasn't easy as Ramsay was visibly troubled by the dilemma of picking between a very driven and talented chef (Rock) and a chef that had grown and exhibited great potential (Julia). In the end, Ramsay eliminated Julia, leaving the other contestants shocked and distraught, in particular Bonnie, who later states how she felt guilty about having Julia eliminated. Though in a break from his usual heavy criticism, Ramsay heaped praise on how far she progressed in spite of her Waffle House background. In an unprecedented move so far on Hell's Kitchen, he said he would personally send Julia to culinary school and invite her to come back and win it all once she has finished.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/308.htm Fox.com - Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.08 recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811215313/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/308.htm |date=August 11, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"To become a great chef you must have a natural ability.

Rock's turned out to be spaghetti, Bonnie's was [[Hot Dog|Franks and Beans]], and Jen's ended up being fried chicken. Bonnie spent a large portion of her time not knowing what Franks and Beans even was. After having 1 hour to complete their dishes Ramsay brought in their mothers to judge. Bonnie did an Italian version of beans and franks, mini bruschettas. She served it with a mushroom cream leek sauce. Rock did what he called a study of spaghetti, there was three different spaghettis. A cream sauce, a veal and a spicy chorizo and pork. Jen did a fried chicken roulade stuffed with crab meat, spinach and goat cheese. All three contestants were in tears at this surprise. Their mothers were seated with their backs to the chefs so that they did not know who made which dish, in order to keep the judging unbiased. Jen won the challenge after all three mothers chose her stuffed fried chicken breasts as the best dish. Bonnie's mother later admitted she knew which one was Bonnie's but voted for Jen's anyway.\n\n'''Reward/punishment''': Jen and Ramsay went to lunch with their mothers. Ramsay then dropped her off at a kitchen supply warehouse and gave her $1000 to go shopping with. At the end of the episode, Jen was shown spending almost $300 buying Kasumi steak knives for Bonnie and Rock. Rock and Bonnie had to work together to clean the dormitories where Bonnie complained the whole time. Rock noted that she knew surprisingly little about cleaning for being a professional Nanny. Bonnie admitted that she is really only a \"nanny\" in that she sometimes watches her clients' kids while performing as their personal chef.\n\n'''Service''': Before dinner service, Ramsay had each contestant practice their angriest dressing down to his face. Bonnie noted how satisfying it was to have the rare opportunity to curse at Ramsay for a change. Jen struggled being serious but included many expletives to get her point across. Rock also struggled with coming across effectively. During service, Ramsay made each contestant work the pass, calling out orders and putting the finishing touches on dishes before handing them off to the servers. Ramsay tested each contestant on their leadership, time management, and quality control. He had sous-chefs Scott and Mary Ann deliberately sabotage dishes to see if the contestants would catch the mistakes. Jen was the first to work the pass, where she missed a spaghetti dish that went out without any crab and, as a result, began sending dishes back even though they were edible. Though she recovered her composure and caught an overcooked and underseasoned risotto, her lack of experience was shown in her leadership. She also ran out of risottos near the end of service, due to overcooking the rice. Rock caught a monkfish being sent out without ham, though was criticized for working to slowly plating the dishes and not being vocal enough; Bonnie pointed out that he was an executive chef and should have performed better. Lastly, Bonnie struggled in calling off orders, though spotted an undercooked pigeon and Jen's risotto with no salt, and gained confidence over time. Ramsay praised them all for the best service so far, before instructing them to come up with a reason why they should stay.\n\n'''Elimination''':  All three went back to the dorm and Jen questioned Bonnie's motive for wanting to stay asking her if this is really what she wanted. Jen didn't feel as though this was a serious dream for Bonnie, not helped by the fact that Bonnie admitted she was unsure if she wanted it because of her limited experience. All were called before Ramsay and explained their reasons to stay. Ramsay called Rock's name first, giving everyone the impression that he was about to be sent home, and said that he had made the final two. Ramsay then decided to eliminate Jen but praised her for her talent and determination. Jen's elimination had upset both Bonnie and Rock, as she had become close with both of them, and they both admitted they wanted to see Jen reach the final. After the elimination, Ramsay surprised Rock and Bonnie with a visit from Rock's wife and kids and Bonnie's parents.

Both chefs begin planning for their side of restaurant, including decor, staff uniforms and menus. Both chefs get to meet an architect which would help them complete what they want for their side of the restaurant, while Jean-Philippe assists both with selection of their servers' uniforms. Bonnie wants to go with a French bistro feel where nothing matches, there are no booths, and servers are required to wear all black. Rock wants a simple black/black design with servers in jeans which Jean-Philippe quickly dismissed. Bonnie's menu is reflective of her favorite dishes with her signature dish being her Prawn Fettuccine while Rock's is based on southern food with his [[Surf and turf]] of fried chicken and crab cakes as his starter. Bonnie seemed to flow with ideas about her restaurant while Rock struggled with deciding on most of the aspects.\n\n'''Challenge''': After they have selected their restaurant's decor, the two chefs travel to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with Ramsay on a private plane and are given a tour of the Green Valley Ranch Resort.  In a surprise challenge, Ramsay tells the final two they have thirty minutes to create their specialty dish (listed above) and present it to the top chefs of Las Vegas. The dishes are judged by seven judges, including other chefs from Las Vegas restaurants, [[Robin Leach]], seasons one and two Hell's Kitchen winners [[Hell's Kitchen (American season 1)|Michael Wray]] and [[Hell's Kitchen (American season 2)|Heather West]], respectively, and the duo of the owner and head chef of the Green Valley Ranch Resort who cast the deciding vote. Bonnie won the challenge four votes to three.\n\nThe last six eliminated chefs Julia, Jen, Brad, Josh, Melissa and Vinnie were reunited with the final two. Julia was very emotional, struggling with the disappointment of not making it to the finale, plus the fact that Bonnie chose Julia over Jen to be up on the chopping block in the first place. Julia privately admitted that she was rooting for Rock, though stated she was not going to let this ruin her dinner service. Rock and Bonnie chose their team for the season finale, with Bonnie selecting first for winning the previous challenge. Bonnie chooses Jen, Melissa, and Julia, while Rock chooses Brad, Vinnie, and Josh. Julia was bitter over Bonnie choosing Melissa before herself, though Bonnie admitted she only did so as Julia may hinder the team by being emotional. Rock passed over Julia knowing he would end up with Josh, saying that he understood Josh and more importantly because Julia's feelings could be a liability even though he considered her better than Josh. In the end, both retain the same team members they had from the start of the season, resulting in all-male and all-female teams. However, this episode ended with [[cliffhanger|a cliffhanger of sorts]].<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/310.htm Fox.com - Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.10 recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204523/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/310.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n| LineColor = 66A3B6\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Hell's Kitchen (American season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber = 33\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 11\n| Title = Winner Announced\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2007|8|13}}\n| ShortSummary =\n'''Preparations''': Continuing from previous episode, Rock organized his team well while Bonnie took a relaxed laid back approach, admitting she had not cooked most of her items. In the kitchen while planning recipes, Julia frequently snapped at Bonnie, while Rock convinced Josh that he is capable and just needs self-confidence to perform well. The two finalists presented their appetizers and entrees to Ramsay; Bonnie's goat cheese salad and her signature prawn fettuccine, Rock's [[surf and turf]] (fried chicken and crabcakes) and rib eye steak. Ramsay tells Bonnie that her chocolate truffle assortment is on the small side, while advising Rock to serve his milkshake (and cookies) in martini glasses instead of a huge tall glass. Ramsay then toured their halves of the restaurant asking for their redesign explanations and had no complaints. Before service starts, Ramsay presents Bonnie and Rock with their own head chef's jackets.\n\n'''Service''':  Rock's team struggled early with Josh constantly burning the crab cakes and putting them 30 minutes behind. After a warning from Ramsay that Josh was ruining everything, Rock made a decisive move and switched Josh and Vinnie's positions, and from then on there were no more major problems. Rock pledged that he would work every station to make the food perfect and even started cooking dishes himself when the others couldn't handle. Bonnie's team started out strong on the appetizers, but Melissa overcooked the prawns. However, they were soon plagued by lack of communications, particularly as Jen and especially Julia didn't take Bonnie seriously, and an emotional Julia defied orders which, in turn, led to Bonnie tuning her out. After two orders of fettucine were returned for being undercooked and cold, Bonnie realized that they had ran out of prawns due to portion mismanagement and had no other seafood ready to go, forcing her to send out the rest of the orders with only pasta. Dessert went smoothly for both sides.\n\n'''Winner''':  During the debrief, Ramsay asked each chef what they would have changed. Rock stated that he would have won the challenge to get Jen with the first pick, complimenting her cooking skills (which made Jen feel honored), while saying that Josh ''\"really screwed up\"'' and would have been left off his team (which slightly angered Josh). Bonnie admitted that she was not careful in monitoring portion sizes and thus ran out of ingredients. Ramsay had no substantial criticism for either chef, only saying that ''\"You both came out with leadership qualities\"'', noting that Bonnie has improved her assertiveness while Rock was considered ''\"rock-solid\"''. Ramsay considered all aspects in making his decision, including how each chef ran the kitchen and ''every'' customer feedback card. Both Rock and Bonnie stood in front of the two doors and whoever's door opened would be the winner. Rock broke down in tears when his door opened and was declared the winner of ''Hell's Kitchen'' Season 3, and Bonnie immediately went to congratulate him.<ref>[http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/311.htm Fox.com - Hell's Kitchen - Episode 3.11 recap] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204550/http://www.fox.com/hellskitchen/recaps/311.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n'''Ramsay's comment''': \"Rock deserved to win Hell's Kitchen because he's a very confident cook and he has become a really good leader. He can motivate staff, he can create, all those qualities are not easy to find in one chef.

The school district had already planned for a second high school to be built on what was then the extreme north side of the city across Walnut Avenue from the Greentree residential tract which was completed in 1973. Dr. Dean Waldfogel was chosen to be the first principal of Irvine High School; Waldfogel selected his faculty of a dozen teachers from a large number of applicants. The fledgling organization accepted its first class of 300 freshmen in September 1975. Because the high school's buildings were still under construction and not ready for occupation, the new high school was housed in extra classrooms and portable buildings at [[Rancho San Joaquin Middle School]], sharing facilities such as sports, music and the library with the younger students there. The new Irvine High School campus opened its doors in September 1976, taking in as sophomores the former class of \"Rancho\" ninth graders as well as a new class of freshmen. Each successive year added another class of freshmen and in September, 1978, the high school finally had all four classes of students. Construction continued on campus during this time, with the theater and the main gym becoming available in 1977, the football-track field in 1978 and the aquatic center in 1979. The first class graduated in June, 1979.\n\n[[File:IrvineHigh1970s architectural model.jpg|thumb|Early [[architectural model]] of Irvine High School as published in the 1976 yearbook, showing the hexagonal design scheme which extends throughout the plan.]]\nThe campus itself is notable for its architecture. It was designed by architect Ron D. Young in the [[Brutalist architecture]] style, and built largely of [[tilt up]] concrete slabs featuring distinctive cast geometric inlays. The shapes and angles of floor plans and design motifs were based on the [[hexagon]]. The initial layout of the Humanities building envisioned two or three teachers and their respective students sharing a single [[open plan]] hexagonal room, but this quickly proved too distracting. Portable office dividers were placed in a line to define classroom boundaries, but noise was still a problem. After two years of such conditions, walls were erected to close off the large, open hexagons.\n\n==Academic teams==\n[[File:Irvine High Campus, Exterior Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Exterior of Irvine High School, with Student Center in the background]]\nIrvine High has several distinguished academic teams.

The school district had already planned for a second high school to be built on what was then the extreme north side of the city across Walnut Avenue from the Greentree residential tract which was completed in 1973. Dr. Dean Waldfogel was chosen to be the first principal of Irvine High School; Waldfogel selected his faculty of a dozen teachers from a large number of applicants. The fledgling organization accepted its first class of 300 freshmen in September 1975. Because the high school's buildings were still under construction and not ready for occupation, the new high school was housed in extra classrooms and portable buildings at [[Rancho San Joaquin Middle School]], sharing facilities such as sports, music and the library with the younger students there. The new Irvine High School campus opened its doors in September 1976, taking in as sophomores the former class of \"Rancho\" ninth graders as well as a new class of freshmen. Each successive year added another class of freshmen and in September, 1978, the high school finally had all four classes of students. Construction continued on campus during this time, with the theater and the main gym becoming available in 1977, the football-track field in 1978 and the aquatic center in 1979. The first class graduated in June, 1979.\n\n[[File:IrvineHigh1970s architectural model.jpg|thumb|Early [[architectural model]] of Irvine High School as published in the 1976 yearbook, showing the hexagonal design scheme which extends throughout the plan.]]\nThe campus itself is notable for its architecture. It was designed by architect Ron D. Young in the [[Brutalist architecture]] style, and built largely of [[tilt up]] concrete slabs featuring distinctive cast geometric inlays. The shapes and angles of floor plans and design motifs were based on the [[hexagon]]. The initial layout of the Humanities building envisioned two or three teachers and their respective students sharing a single [[open plan]] hexagonal room, but this quickly proved too distracting. Portable office dividers were placed in a line to define classroom boundaries, but noise was still a problem. After two years of such conditions, walls were erected to close off the large, open hexagons.\n\n==Academic teams==\n[[File:Irvine High Campus, Exterior Buildings.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Exterior of Irvine High School, with Student Center in the background]]\nIrvine High has several distinguished academic teams.

His overconfidence has left him mostly isolated, with the exception of his friends Koharu and Ash. According to Koharu, Go has been known to skip school to wander around town, much to her chagrin. Despite his calm personality, he can also become hot-blooded when his opinion is challenged, and he will not hesitate to defend others when he sees them being mistreated, which helped him bond with a wild Scorbunny in SS004. Go likes to throw his Pok\u00e9 Balls with a curve, but his aim tends to be off. Though he seems athletic, Go lacks good climbing skills despite his efforts to get better at it. He is also highly knowledgeable about Pok\u00e9mon, being fairly adept at information-gathering and analyzing, both of which were useful in gathering clues. Despite his deep knowledge of Pok\u00e9mon, Go is still a rookie Trainer and lacks experience, best evidenced by his tendency to throw Pok\u00e9 Balls at any Pok\u00e9mon he encounters, rather than weaken them through battle as is the usual practice. This usually backfires on Go in the long run. For example, in SS010, he recklessly wasted all of the Pok\u00e9 Balls he was given to catch a single Dewgong, which resulted in him being unable to catch the Dratini evolutionary line when he and Ash encountered them. His lack of expertise is also evidenced in his battles, where he shows a tactical, by-the-book approach of exploiting type advantages, but is unable to properly respond against more seasoned adversaries, which leads to a crushing defeat.

His ability to speak like a normal human only makes him equally outspoken. He sometimes views himself as the boss and the leader of the trio, reason being, he builds all the contraptions and thinks of all the plans, though he is rarely taken seriously. For all his faults however, he is loyal to Jessie and James, and never lets a few fights get in his way of being friends with them. He thinks highly of their boss Giovanni, and dwells on becoming his \"top cat\". Meowth is superb at lying, as he often tricks Ash and his friends to believe he is on their side. Pikachu is the only one who doubts Meowth's loyalty due to remembering his countless double crosses. Despite their rivalry, Meowth has arguably the most sociable moments with Pikachu, especially since they are often forced to team up for real. In some cases he laments they can easily be friends if not on opposite sides. As often as he likes to consider himself a dastardly villain, he is also often shown to be rather jaded and even philosophical at times. He often looks at the moon and laments his directions in life. Among the trio, Meowth tends to be the one who stands most on the facts rather than belief. Meowth frequently shows himself to be a rather amorous cat: in Kanto, before he met Jessie and James, he fell in love with a female Meowth named Meowzie, in Hoenn he fell in love with May's Skitty and in Sinnoh he fell in love with a female Glameow. In Unova he competed with Ash's Oshawott for both a male Purloin and Meloetta despite she was the main target for Team Rocket's Operation Tempest in the BW series until in the episode Unova Survival Crisis!. Also, in the short \"Eevee and Friends\" he also shown attraction for Espeon, Glaceon and Leafeon. His pursuits for Meowzie in particular chained off his ambitions to learn to speak and act human-like and ultimately his employment within Team Rocket. Meowth sparsely battles, he explains learning to walk and talk came at the expense of his battle abilities. As such, most instances he is forced to fight prove pitiful. On rare occasions however, when passionate or incensed enough, Meowth can be very formidable in battle. He has also proven quite able as a performer as well, helping Jessie win several contests and showcases. More commonly, Meowth acts as a translator for Team Rocket and sometimes Ash and his friends, translating what other Pok\u00e9mon are saying. Meowth is jealous of Giovanni's Persian and has a desire to fill in for it as the boss's \"top cat\". In \"Acting True to Form!\", Meowth has a bitter rivalry with an Alolan Meowth who is very smart and cunning and also loyal to Jessie and James. Upon hearing that the Alolan Meowth was now working with Team Rocket later owned by their secretary Matori, he became disappointed to hear when he translated its language about its main reason to stay at their headquarters.\n*;{{nihongo|Wobbuffet|\u30bd-\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9|Sonansu}}\n:''Voiced by'': Y\u016bji Ueda (Japanese), Kayzie Rogers (EP146-XY140; English) & Erica Schroeder (SM003-present; English)\n: Wobbuffet is used occasionally for battles, and now he joins Team Rocket.

He and Colress discussed the current status of the Pok\u00e9mon control experiment, and when Ash, his friends, and Looker approached Team Plasma's laboratory, Ghetsis ordered Colress to turn the experimental Pok\u00e9mon loose on them. He appeared again, this time in person, in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\". He was seen contacting Colress for an update on his Pok\u00e9mon control experiment. Later, Ghetsis spoke to several Team Plasma Grunts, who were spying on the excavations made at the White Ruins as well as looking for N and conducting the mysterious \"Project G\" and \"Project F\". Ghetsis reappeared in \"Secrets From Out of the Fog!\", where he was seen discussing his plans with Colress and Aldith. He was also seen in flashbacks to N's past, in which he raised N alongside Anthea and Concordia and wild Pok\u00e9mon. In a later flashback, a ceremony he led in N's Castle involving N and the Seven Sages was interrupted by Reshiram, infuriating him. In \"What Lies Beyond Truth and Ideals!\", Ghetsis successfully summoned Reshiram and, with the help of Colress's machine, took control of it. Despite turning it on his enemies, however, he lost control of Reshiram when Colress's machine was destroyed.

However, he is not part of Team Plasma, but rather a defected member; Ghetsis raised him along with Anthea and Concordia, making them believe Pok\u00e9mon cannot be equals with humans unless they are released from all Pok\u00e9 Balls. A short time before the present,{{clarify|date=November 2018}}{{episode needed|date=November 2018}} N was about to be crowned King of Team Plasma in Ghetsis' plan to use N's pure-hearted desire to save Pok\u00e9mon to summon Reshiram and enslave it.

His goal is to discover the true way to draw out the strength of Pok\u00e9mon. Colress debuts in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Power Plot!\", conducting experiments with wild Pok\u00e9mon with electromagnetic waves in an attempt to bring out their true strength. He plants one of his controlling devices on Ash's Pikachu, forcing him to fight his Trainer. However, Ash's encouragement allows Pikachu to fight against the EM waves, eventually causing the device to break and freeing Pikachu. Before he can gather further data, Team Rocket shows up, using one of their miniature robots to steal Colress's research data from his computer. Colress appears again in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\", where it was revealed that he had upgraded his Pok\u00e9mon-controlling machine with his remaining research data. The machine now fires a narrow energy beam which instantly brings any Pok\u00e9mon it hits under Team Plasma's control. Using this machine, Colress takes control of a Haxorus and Iris's Dragonite. A Shadow Ball from Aldith's Liepard accidentally hits the machine, breaking it and freeing Haxorus and Dragonite from his control. Colress and the Plasma Grunts retreat. Colress appears briefly in \"Secrets From Out of the Fog!\" with Aldith, discussing Team Plasma's plans with Ghetsis on a videophone call. Colress appears again in \"Meowth, Colress and Team Rivalry!\", where he refuses Meowth's attempt to recruit him to Team Rocket. However, he offers to allow Meowth to participate in an experiment to increase his strength. Colress controls Meowth's mind with the experiment, but Jessie and James snap him out of it before escaping. Later, Colress is seen with his Grunts reporting to Ghetsis, who revealed information about the Light Stone to them. In \"Ash and N: A Clash of Ideals!\", Colress appears with the rest of Team Plasma to commence their operation at the White Ruins. While Aldith, Barret and many other Grunts ambush the workers at the site, Colress uses his perfected machine to seize control of the workers' Pok\u00e9mon and turn them on their Trainers. In \"Team Plasma and the Awakening Ceremony!\", he also takes control of Pikachu again, forcing N to surrender the Light Stone to Team Plasma in exchange for Ash's safety. He appears again in \"What Lies Beyond Truth and Ideals!\", aiding Ghetsis in taking control of the awakened Reshiram. When Ash and Pikachu try to stop him, he uses his machine on Pikachu yet again. However, this time Pikachu fights against its control, and - together with Reshiram - destroy Colress's machine once and for all, thus freeing the controlled Pok\u00e9mon. Colress and the other Team Plasma members are later arrested by Looker, thus bringing the team down.\n*;{{nihongo|Aldith|\u30a2\u30f3\u30b8\u30fc|Anj\u012b|Angie}}\n:''Voiced by'': [[Akeno Watanabe]] (Japanese), Lori Gardner (English)\n:A member of Team Plasma, Aldith first appears in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Power Plot!\", observing Colress's work with controlling wild Pok\u00e9mon with radio waves. During the tests, she experiences some friction with the scientist in terms of their ultimate goals; while Aldith expected the results of the experiment to help Team Plasma's takeover of Unova, Colress was merely interested in unlocking the true strength of Pok\u00e9mon. When Looker, Ash and his friends arrive, she orders her fellow grunts to hold them off until Colress's test subjects are battle-ready, at which point she leads a retreat to lure her foes into their observatory base. Aldith commands Colress's brainwashed wild Pok\u00e9mon against the intruders, as well as Pikachu when Colress attaches a transmitter to its head. When Pikachu manages to overcome the brainwashing, Aldith reminds Colress about the situation. After Team Rocket's interference destroys Colress's machine, freeing the mind-controlled Pok\u00e9mon, Aldith joins her teammates in retreat, using a self-destruct mechanism to destroy the observatory and get rid of the remaining evidence of their activity. She reappears in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\", where once again monitors a mind-controlling experiment of Colress, this time on a Haxorus.

His overconfidence has left him mostly isolated, with the exception of his friends Koharu and Ash. According to Koharu, Go has been known to skip school to wander around town, much to her chagrin. Despite his calm personality, he can also become hot-blooded when his opinion is challenged, and he will not hesitate to defend others when he sees them being mistreated, which helped him bond with a wild Scorbunny in SS004. Go likes to throw his Pok\u00e9 Balls with a curve, but his aim tends to be off. Though he seems athletic, Go lacks good climbing skills despite his efforts to get better at it. He is also highly knowledgeable about Pok\u00e9mon, being fairly adept at information-gathering and analyzing, both of which were useful in gathering clues. Despite his deep knowledge of Pok\u00e9mon, Go is still a rookie Trainer and lacks experience, best evidenced by his tendency to throw Pok\u00e9 Balls at any Pok\u00e9mon he encounters, rather than weaken them through battle as is the usual practice. This usually backfires on Go in the long run. For example, in SS010, he recklessly wasted all of the Pok\u00e9 Balls he was given to catch a single Dewgong, which resulted in him being unable to catch the Dratini evolutionary line when he and Ash encountered them. His lack of expertise is also evidenced in his battles, where he shows a tactical, by-the-book approach of exploiting type advantages, but is unable to properly respond against more seasoned adversaries, which leads to a crushing defeat.

His ability to speak like a normal human only makes him equally outspoken. He sometimes views himself as the boss and the leader of the trio, reason being, he builds all the contraptions and thinks of all the plans, though he is rarely taken seriously. For all his faults however, he is loyal to Jessie and James, and never lets a few fights get in his way of being friends with them. He thinks highly of their boss Giovanni, and dwells on becoming his \"top cat\". Meowth is superb at lying, as he often tricks Ash and his friends to believe he is on their side. Pikachu is the only one who doubts Meowth's loyalty due to remembering his countless double crosses. Despite their rivalry, Meowth has arguably the most sociable moments with Pikachu, especially since they are often forced to team up for real. In some cases he laments they can easily be friends if not on opposite sides. As often as he likes to consider himself a dastardly villain, he is also often shown to be rather jaded and even philosophical at times. He often looks at the moon and laments his directions in life. Among the trio, Meowth tends to be the one who stands most on the facts rather than belief. Meowth frequently shows himself to be a rather amorous cat: in Kanto, before he met Jessie and James, he fell in love with a female Meowth named Meowzie, in Hoenn he fell in love with May's Skitty and in Sinnoh he fell in love with a female Glameow. In Unova he competed with Ash's Oshawott for both a male Purloin and Meloetta despite she was the main target for Team Rocket's Operation Tempest in the BW series until in the episode Unova Survival Crisis!. Also, in the short \"Eevee and Friends\" he also shown attraction for Espeon, Glaceon and Leafeon. His pursuits for Meowzie in particular chained off his ambitions to learn to speak and act human-like and ultimately his employment within Team Rocket. Meowth sparsely battles, he explains learning to walk and talk came at the expense of his battle abilities. As such, most instances he is forced to fight prove pitiful. On rare occasions however, when passionate or incensed enough, Meowth can be very formidable in battle. He has also proven quite able as a performer as well, helping Jessie win several contests and showcases. More commonly, Meowth acts as a translator for Team Rocket and sometimes Ash and his friends, translating what other Pok\u00e9mon are saying. Meowth is jealous of Giovanni's Persian and has a desire to fill in for it as the boss's \"top cat\". In \"Acting True to Form!\", Meowth has a bitter rivalry with an Alolan Meowth who is very smart and cunning and also loyal to Jessie and James. Upon hearing that the Alolan Meowth was now working with Team Rocket later owned by their secretary Matori, he became disappointed to hear when he translated its language about its main reason to stay at their headquarters.\n*;{{nihongo|Wobbuffet|\u30bd-\u30ca\u30f3\u30b9|Sonansu}}\n:''Voiced by'': Y\u016bji Ueda (Japanese), Kayzie Rogers (EP146-XY140; English) & Erica Schroeder (SM003-present; English)\n: Wobbuffet is used occasionally for battles, and now he joins Team Rocket.

He and Colress discussed the current status of the Pok\u00e9mon control experiment, and when Ash, his friends, and Looker approached Team Plasma's laboratory, Ghetsis ordered Colress to turn the experimental Pok\u00e9mon loose on them. He appeared again, this time in person, in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\". He was seen contacting Colress for an update on his Pok\u00e9mon control experiment. Later, Ghetsis spoke to several Team Plasma Grunts, who were spying on the excavations made at the White Ruins as well as looking for N and conducting the mysterious \"Project G\" and \"Project F\". Ghetsis reappeared in \"Secrets From Out of the Fog!\", where he was seen discussing his plans with Colress and Aldith. He was also seen in flashbacks to N's past, in which he raised N alongside Anthea and Concordia and wild Pok\u00e9mon. In a later flashback, a ceremony he led in N's Castle involving N and the Seven Sages was interrupted by Reshiram, infuriating him. In \"What Lies Beyond Truth and Ideals!\", Ghetsis successfully summoned Reshiram and, with the help of Colress's machine, took control of it. Despite turning it on his enemies, however, he lost control of Reshiram when Colress's machine was destroyed.

However, he is not part of Team Plasma, but rather a defected member; Ghetsis raised him along with Anthea and Concordia, making them believe Pok\u00e9mon cannot be equals with humans unless they are released from all Pok\u00e9 Balls. A short time before the present,{{clarify|date=November 2018}}{{episode needed|date=November 2018}} N was about to be crowned King of Team Plasma in Ghetsis' plan to use N's pure-hearted desire to save Pok\u00e9mon to summon Reshiram and enslave it.

His goal is to discover the true way to draw out the strength of Pok\u00e9mon. Colress debuts in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Power Plot!\", conducting experiments with wild Pok\u00e9mon with electromagnetic waves in an attempt to bring out their true strength. He plants one of his controlling devices on Ash's Pikachu, forcing him to fight his Trainer. However, Ash's encouragement allows Pikachu to fight against the EM waves, eventually causing the device to break and freeing Pikachu. Before he can gather further data, Team Rocket shows up, using one of their miniature robots to steal Colress's research data from his computer. Colress appears again in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\", where it was revealed that he had upgraded his Pok\u00e9mon-controlling machine with his remaining research data. The machine now fires a narrow energy beam which instantly brings any Pok\u00e9mon it hits under Team Plasma's control. Using this machine, Colress takes control of a Haxorus and Iris's Dragonite. A Shadow Ball from Aldith's Liepard accidentally hits the machine, breaking it and freeing Haxorus and Dragonite from his control. Colress and the Plasma Grunts retreat. Colress appears briefly in \"Secrets From Out of the Fog!\" with Aldith, discussing Team Plasma's plans with Ghetsis on a videophone call. Colress appears again in \"Meowth, Colress and Team Rivalry!\", where he refuses Meowth's attempt to recruit him to Team Rocket. However, he offers to allow Meowth to participate in an experiment to increase his strength. Colress controls Meowth's mind with the experiment, but Jessie and James snap him out of it before escaping. Later, Colress is seen with his Grunts reporting to Ghetsis, who revealed information about the Light Stone to them. In \"Ash and N: A Clash of Ideals!\", Colress appears with the rest of Team Plasma to commence their operation at the White Ruins. While Aldith, Barret and many other Grunts ambush the workers at the site, Colress uses his perfected machine to seize control of the workers' Pok\u00e9mon and turn them on their Trainers. In \"Team Plasma and the Awakening Ceremony!\", he also takes control of Pikachu again, forcing N to surrender the Light Stone to Team Plasma in exchange for Ash's safety. He appears again in \"What Lies Beyond Truth and Ideals!\", aiding Ghetsis in taking control of the awakened Reshiram. When Ash and Pikachu try to stop him, he uses his machine on Pikachu yet again. However, this time Pikachu fights against its control, and - together with Reshiram - destroy Colress's machine once and for all, thus freeing the controlled Pok\u00e9mon. Colress and the other Team Plasma members are later arrested by Looker, thus bringing the team down.\n*;{{nihongo|Aldith|\u30a2\u30f3\u30b8\u30fc|Anj\u012b|Angie}}\n:''Voiced by'': [[Akeno Watanabe]] (Japanese), Lori Gardner (English)\n:A member of Team Plasma, Aldith first appears in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Power Plot!\", observing Colress's work with controlling wild Pok\u00e9mon with radio waves. During the tests, she experiences some friction with the scientist in terms of their ultimate goals; while Aldith expected the results of the experiment to help Team Plasma's takeover of Unova, Colress was merely interested in unlocking the true strength of Pok\u00e9mon. When Looker, Ash and his friends arrive, she orders her fellow grunts to hold them off until Colress's test subjects are battle-ready, at which point she leads a retreat to lure her foes into their observatory base. Aldith commands Colress's brainwashed wild Pok\u00e9mon against the intruders, as well as Pikachu when Colress attaches a transmitter to its head. When Pikachu manages to overcome the brainwashing, Aldith reminds Colress about the situation. After Team Rocket's interference destroys Colress's machine, freeing the mind-controlled Pok\u00e9mon, Aldith joins her teammates in retreat, using a self-destruct mechanism to destroy the observatory and get rid of the remaining evidence of their activity. She reappears in \"Team Plasma's Pok\u00e9mon Manipulation!\", where once again monitors a mind-controlling experiment of Colress, this time on a Haxorus.
