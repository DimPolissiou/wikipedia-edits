{"title_page": "Pat of Silver Bush", "text_new": "[[Image:PatOfSilverBush.jpg|thumb|First edition]]'''''Pat of Silver Bush''''' (1933) is a novel written by [[Lucy Maud Montgomery]], noted for her ''[[Anne of Green Gables]]'' series.  The protagonist, Patricia Gardiner (called Pat), hates change of any kind and loves her home, Silver Bush, more than anything else in the world. She is very devoted to her family: her father and mother, her brothers Joe and Sid, and her sisters Winnie and Rachel (who everyone in the family calls Cuddles). The book begins when Pat is 7 years old and ends when she is 18.\n\nThroughout the text, various members of Pat's family are lost from Silver Bush (Aunt Hazel to marriage, Joe to life as a sailor, and Winnie to marriage).  Pat is sustained through these losses due to her enduring love for her home. She is \"unlike other children\" and has few close friends.  She maintains a strong friendship with Hilary \"Jingle\" Gordon, and later befriends Elizabeth \"Bets\" Wilcox, who eventually dies of the [[Influenza epidemic of 1918|flu]].\n\nLike most of Montgomery's texts, ''Pat'' is a domestic tale.  Unlike Anne Shirley or Emily Starr, the only other Montgomery heroines whose stories are told in multiple texts, Pat is neither ambitious nor a writer.  She also has a conventional family and home life, unlike the others, who are orphans.\n\nThe book's sequel, ''[[Mistress Pat]]'', describes her later years.\n\nThe ''Pat of Silver Bush'' copyright was renewed in 1960.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Library of Congress.

apparently came from a mixed Albanian-Bosnian background, but he was known as an Albanian.\"; p. 210. \"Two Albanians are worth noting in this regard. \u015eemsi Pasa, a Geg...\"</ref> He was born in a small village within [[Sanjak of \u0130pek|\u0130pek Sanjak]], [[Kosovo Vilayet]], [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1846.<ref name=\"Gawrych110133\"/> Originating from a humble background and being unschooled, he began his military career first as a private and later was promoted to ''farik'' (general).<ref name=\"Gawrych133210\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=133, 210.}}</ref><ref name=\"Hanioglu267\"/> Shemsi as such was an ''ayal\u0131'' (a person that rises through the army ranks to become an officer) and not a ''mektepli'' (a person who gets military school education and then enters the officer corps).<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/> In 1901 Shemsi, a favorite of [[Abdul Hamid II]] and his trusted official was appointed as commander of the 18th Infantry Division based in [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovi\u00e7e]] (modern Mitrovic\u00eb) that protected an important northern entry route into the empire.<ref name=\"Gawrych110133\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=110, 133.}}</ref> For seven years the 18th Infantry Division was under his command and the sultan came to rely on him as someone with ingenuity who could take care of local problems in the region of Kosovo.<ref name=\"Gawrych133139210\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=133, 139, 210.}}</ref> The Mektepli officers viewed him as a simple man with a several centuries old mindset while regular soldiers respected Shemsi as he came from their ranks and rose in the army based on demonstrated skills gained from experience.<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/> Shemsi was also the military envoy to the Ottoman Inspector General based in [[Thessaloniki|Selanik]] (modern Thessaloniki).<ref name=\"Clayer92\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=92.}}</ref>\n\nIn his career Shemsi had to deal with corrupt or incompetent officials in difficult circumstances.<ref name=\"Gawrych110\"/> During February 1905 he attempted to remove Brigadier Cavid Bey as mutasarr\u0131f of [[Pej\u00eb|\u0130pek]] (modern Pej\u00eb) for having caused problems due to disrespect toward Albanian customs and traditions.<ref name=\"Gawrych110113\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=110, 113.}}</ref> In [[Elbasan]] of May 1907 Shemsi placed blame for a small disturbance on two bad officials who later got promoted for their disservice.<ref name=\"Gawrych110\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=110.}}</ref> \n\n=== Religious conflict in Kosovo between Muslims and Catholics (1907-1908) ===\n\nReligious conflict between Muslims and Catholics erupted in villages around [[Gjakov\u00eb|Yakova]] (modern Gjakov\u00eb) and Shemsi Pasha was sent to bring order to the area, as he was in charge of resolving conflicts in Kosovo.<ref name=\"Clayer909394\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=90, 93, 94.}}</ref> An Albanian, S\u00fcleyman K\u00fcl\u00e7e, the adjuntant and personal secretary of Shemsi thought that Abdul Hamid II was mistaken in selecting officers whom lacked an education like the General for resolving problems of the area.<ref name=\"Clayer94\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=94.}}</ref><ref name=\"Zurcher29\">{{harvnb|Z\u00fcrcher|2014|p=29.}}</ref> During the start of the Muslim religious holiday [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayram]], Shemsi got a telegram in early September 1907 about an incident in Smolic\u00eb regarding the profanation of the village mosque with a dead pig.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> The Italian consul in Kosovo thought it was a reaction by Catholics to the kidnapping of a Catholic priest held captive in Smolic\u00eb by Muslims, a first time act by them in the area and tensions rapidly rose between both religious communities.<ref name=\"Clayer9495\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=94-95.}}</ref> [[Edith Durham]], a British traveler present in the region commented that the priest was held by Muslims whom demanded that Ottoman authorities release a relative of one of the captors in exchange for the hostage.<ref name=\"Clayer93\"/> \n\nIn short time Shemsi told the local Islamic clergy to soften the reactions of Muslims and stated to them that the pig's dead body did not profane the mosque and ordered the people responsible for the incident be found.<ref name=\"Clayer9599\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=95, 99.}}</ref> In January 1908, an order was received by Shemsi to go with soldiers to Yakova.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Later at the town Shemsi was met by a Catholic priest who passed on a letter about local Christians having been killed in the area.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Shemsi then assembled Muslim notables of Yakova and the wider area and said that most Catholics subjected to attacks were innocent.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Troops were left in the town after Shemsi departed.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> During his time in Yakova, Shemsi received a telegraph from [[Prizren]] about a mosque profanation incident.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> The General dismissed the claim as being untrue due to the discovery of the pig being in the river.<ref name=\"Clayer95\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=95.}}</ref> \n\nTensions continued in the region and the sultan thought that the events in Kosovo had supposed links to [[Ismail Qemali]] and his activities.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Abdul Hamid II instructed Shemsi to travel to Prizren and tasked him with appeasing Muslims and protecting Christians.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Shemsi was unable to break and stop a [[Besa (Albanian culture)|besa]] (pledge) which targeted Catholics through boycotts.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Religious tensions continued as the boycott spread and some Catholics fearing a loss of employment converted to Islam while Shemsi also met with the leadership of the remaining Catholics in the area.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> During these events Catholics had sought protection with Ottoman forces and after Shemsi withdrew his troops from the countryside incidents of violence against them occurred.<ref name=\"Clayer93\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=93.}}</ref>\n\nAnother conflict in 1908 occurred in Yakova between local chieftains and the Curri family with Shemsi instructed to resolve the dispute.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> The Curri family refused an invitation for negotiations with the General.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/> Shemsi assembled all the Catholic and Muslim notables in April.<ref name=\"Clayer96\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=96.}}</ref> He convinced all sides to sign an agreement which stated an end to persecution of the peasantry, that trade would be unhindered and concerns held by people would be brought to government officials and not consuls of foreign powers.<ref name=\"Clayer96100\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=96, 100.}}</ref> In the agreement Shemsi attempted to sever the links between Christians and the [[Great Powers]] through use of Ottoman government channels for conflict resolution.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/> The General also requested that Muslims not give a pretext for foreign intervention into the region.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/>\n\nIn Kosovo the [[Austro-Hungarian]] vice-consul was of the view that the attitude of Shemsi did not assist in resolving the

[[Sanjak of \u0130pek|\u0130pek Sanjak]], [[Kosovo Vilayet]], [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1846.<ref name=\"Gawrych110133\"/> Originating from a humble background and being unschooled, he began his military

''ayal\u0131'' (a person that rises through the army ranks to become an officer) and not a ''mektepli'' (a person who gets military school education and then enters the officer corps).<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/> In 1901 Shemsi, a favorite of [[Abdul Hamid II]] and his trusted official was appointed as commander of the 18th Infantry Division based in [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovi\u00e7e]] (modern Mitrovic\u00eb) that protected an important northern entry route into the empire.<ref name=\"Gawrych110133\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=110, 133.}}</ref> For seven years the 18th Infantry

as he came from their ranks and rose in the army based on demonstrated skills gained from experience.<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/> Shemsi was also the military envoy to the Ottoman Inspector General based in [[Thessaloniki|Selanik]] (modern Thessaloniki).<ref name=\"Clayer92\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=92.}}</ref>\n\nIn his career Shemsi had to deal with corrupt or incompetent officials in difficult circumstances.<ref name=\"Gawrych110\"/> During February 1905 he attempted to remove Brigadier Cavid Bey as mutasarr\u0131f of [[Pej\u00eb|\u0130pek]] (modern Pej\u00eb) for having caused problems due to disrespect toward Albanian customs and traditions.<ref name=\"Gawrych110113\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=110, 113.}}</ref> In [[Elbasan]] of May 1907 Shemsi placed blame for a small disturbance on

(1907-1908) ===\n\nReligious conflict between Muslims and Catholics erupted in villages around [[Gjakov\u00eb|Yakova]] (modern Gjakov\u00eb) and Shemsi Pasha was sent to bring order to the area, as he was in charge of resolving conflicts in Kosovo.<ref name=\"Clayer909394\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=90, 93, 94.}}</ref> An Albanian, S\u00fcleyman K\u00fcl\u00e7e, the adjuntant and personal secretary

got a telegram in early September 1907 about an incident in Smolic\u00eb regarding the profanation of the village mosque with a dead pig.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> The Italian consul in Kosovo thought it was a reaction by Catholics to the kidnapping of a Catholic priest held captive in Smolic\u00eb by Muslims, a first time act by them in the area and tensions rapidly rose between both religious communities.<ref name=\"Clayer9495\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=94-95.}}</ref> [[Edith Durham]], a British traveler present in the region commented that the priest was held by Muslims whom demanded that Ottoman authorities release a relative of one of the captors in exchange for the hostage.<ref name=\"Clayer93\"/> \n\nIn short time Shemsi told the local Islamic clergy to soften the reactions of Muslims and stated to them that the pig's dead body did not profane the mosque and ordered the people responsible for the incident be found.<ref name=\"Clayer9599\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=95, 99.}}</ref> In January 1908, an order was received by Shemsi to go with soldiers to Yakova.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Later at the town Shemsi was met by a Catholic priest who passed on a letter about local Christians having been killed in the area.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Shemsi then assembled Muslim notables of Yakova and the wider area and said that most Catholics subjected to attacks were innocent.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Troops were left in the town after Shemsi departed.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> During his time in Yakova, Shemsi received a telegraph from [[Prizren]] about a mosque profanation incident.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> The General dismissed the claim as being untrue due to the discovery of the pig being in the river.<ref name=\"Clayer95\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=95.}}</ref> \n\nTensions continued in the region and the sultan thought that the events in Kosovo had supposed links to [[Ismail Qemali]] and his activities.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Abdul Hamid II instructed Shemsi to travel to Prizren and tasked him with appeasing Muslims and protecting Christians.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Shemsi was unable to break and stop a [[Besa (Albanian culture)|besa]] (pledge) which targeted Catholics through boycotts.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Religious tensions continued as the boycott spread and some Catholics fearing a loss of employment converted to Islam while Shemsi also met with the leadership of the remaining Catholics in the area.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> During these events Catholics had sought protection with Ottoman forces and after Shemsi withdrew his troops from the countryside incidents of violence against them occurred.<ref name=\"Clayer93\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=93.}}</ref>\n\nAnother conflict in 1908 occurred in Yakova between local chieftains and the Curri family with Shemsi instructed to resolve the dispute.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> The Curri family refused an invitation for negotiations with the General.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/> Shemsi assembled all the Catholic and Muslim notables in April.<ref name=\"Clayer96\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=96.}}</ref> He convinced all sides to sign an agreement which stated an end to persecution of the peasantry, that trade would be unhindered and concerns held by people would be brought to government officials and not consuls of foreign powers.<ref name=\"Clayer96100\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=96, 100.}}</ref> In the agreement Shemsi attempted to sever the links between Christians and the [[Great Powers]] through use of Ottoman government channels for conflict resolution.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/> The General also requested that Muslims not give a pretext for foreign intervention into the region.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/>\n\nIn Kosovo the [[Austro-Hungarian]] vice-consul was of the view that the attitude of Shemsi did not assist in resolving the conflict as he arrived with soldiers representing the authority of the government and did nothing to halt events.<ref name=\"Clayer9798\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=97-98.}}</ref> K\u00fcl\u00e7e, Shemsi's secretary also commented that the General was unable to apply policy as suggested by the Grand Vezir and Inspector General due to the stance of the local Vali who was more in line with the sultan's position of not intervening against Muslims.<ref name=\"Clayer100\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=100.}}</ref> The position of Shemsi was also undermined according to K\u00fcl\u00e7e as the General brought soldiers and did not use them.<ref name=\"Clayer101\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=101.}}</ref> Toward the end of June the situation was not settled and Shemsi had to go back to Prizren.<ref

Because of his pathological fear of flying and \"drinking problem\" (being unable to take a drink without splashing it on his face), he has been unable to hold a responsible job. His wartime girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson, now a [[flight attendant]], leaves him before boarding her assigned flight from Los Angeles to Chicago. Ted abandons his taxi and buys a ticket on the same flight to try to win her back. However, she still continues to reject him during the flight.\n\nAfter the in-flight meal is served, several of the passengers and the flight crew fall ill, including Captain Oveur. Passenger Dr. Rumack discovers one of the offered courses caused food poisoning. With the flight crew incapacitated, Elaine contacts the Chicago [[control tower]] for help, and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey to activate the plane's [[autopilot]], a large inflatable pilot doll named \"Otto\", which will get them to Chicago, but will not be able to land the plane. Elaine and Dr. Rumack convince Ted to take the controls. When Steve learns that Ted is piloting, he contacts Ted's former commanding officer, Rex Kramer, now serving as a commercial pilot, so that he can help talk Ted through landing the plane. Ted becomes troubled when Rex starts giving instructions, and briefly stresses out from flashbacks to the war. Both Elaine and Dr. Rumack bolster Ted's confidence and he takes the controls under Rex's guidance.\n\nAs the plane nears Chicago, the weather becomes harsh, making landing difficult. With Elaine's help as co-pilot and Rex's guidance, Ted is able to land the plane safely with the passengers suffering only minor injuries, despite the landing gear being sheared off. Rescue vehicles arrive to help unload the plane. Impressed by Ted's display of courage, Elaine embraces and kisses him, rekindling their relationship. The two watch as \"Otto\" takes control of the plane, inflates a female companion, and takes off.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Airplane screenshot Haggerty Nielsen.jpg|thumb|right|''From left'': the inflatable autopilot \"Otto\" with Julie Hagerty and Leslie Nielsen in the cockpit]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robert Hays]] as Ted Striker\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Elaine Dickinson\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Dr. Rumack\n* [[Peter Graves]] as Capt.

Because of his pathological fear of flying and \"drinking problem\" (being unable to take a drink without splashing it on his face), he has been unable to hold a responsible job. His wartime girlfriend, Elaine Dickinson, now a [[flight attendant]], leaves him before boarding her assigned flight from Los Angeles to Chicago. Ted abandons his taxi and buys a ticket on the same flight to try to win her back. However, she still continues to reject him during the flight.\n\nAfter the in-flight meal is served, several of the passengers and the flight crew fall ill, including Captain Oveur. Passenger Dr. Rumack discovers one of the offered courses caused food poisoning. With the flight crew incapacitated, Elaine contacts the Chicago [[control tower]] for help, and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey to activate the plane's [[autopilot]], a large inflatable pilot doll named \"Otto\", which will get them to Chicago, but will not be able to land the plane. Elaine and Dr. Rumack convince Ted to take the controls. When Steve learns that Ted is piloting, he contacts Ted's former commanding officer, Rex Kramer, now serving as a commercial pilot, so that he can help talk Ted through landing the plane. Ted becomes troubled when Rex starts giving instructions, and briefly stresses out from flashbacks to the war. Both Elaine and Dr. Rumack bolster Ted's confidence and he takes the controls under Rex's guidance.\n\nAs the plane nears Chicago, the weather becomes harsh, making landing difficult. With Elaine's help as co-pilot and Rex's guidance, Ted is able to land the plane safely with the passengers suffering only minor injuries, despite the landing gear being sheared off. Rescue vehicles arrive to help unload the plane. Impressed by Ted's display of courage, Elaine embraces and kisses him, rekindling their relationship. The two watch as \"Otto\" takes control of the plane, inflates a female companion, and takes off.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Airplane screenshot Haggerty Nielsen.jpg|thumb|right|''From left'': the inflatable autopilot \"Otto\" with Julie Hagerty and Leslie Nielsen in the cockpit]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Robert Hays]] as Ted Striker\n* [[Julie Hagerty]] as Elaine Dickinson\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Dr. Rumack\n* [[Peter Graves]] as Capt.
