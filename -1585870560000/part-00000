Despite a variety of long-term band members, singer [[David Thomas (musician)|David Thomas]] is the only constant. They released their debut album ''[[The Modern Dance]]'' in 1978 and followed with several more LPs before disbanding in 1982. Thomas reformed the group in 1987, continuing to record and tour.\n\nDescribing their sound as \"avant-garage,\" Pere Ubu's work drew inspiration from sources such as [[musique concr\u00e8te]], [[rock music#Early 1960s|60s rock]], [[performance art]], and the [[industrial region|industrial environments]] of the American [[Midwest]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Simon|last=Reynolds |authorlink=Simon Reynolds |title=Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978\u20131984  |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |location=London, England|year=2005|isbn=978-0-571-21570-6 |ref=harv|title-link=Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978\u20131984 }}</ref><ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Boehm|title=POP: Pere Ubu still driven by an innovative spirit|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-13/news/ol-1020_1_pere-ubu|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 13, 1991|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}</ref> While the band achieved little commercial success, they have exerted a wide influence on subsequent [[underground music]].<ref name=allmusic/>\n\n==History==\n===1970s===\n[[Rocket from the Tombs]] was a Cleveland-based group that eventually fragmented: some members formed [[The Dead Boys]], and others The Saucers, while [[David Thomas (musician)|David Thomas]] and guitarist [[Peter Laughner]] joined with guitarist Tom Herman, bass guitarist [[Tim Wright (bassist)|Tim Wright]], drummer [[Scott Krauss]] and synthesist [[Allen Ravenstine]] to form Pere Ubu in 1975.  At the time the band formed, Herman, Krauss, and Ravenstine lived in a house owned by Ravenstine.<ref>{{cite web|first=Kirsten|last=Hively |url=http://www.wburg.com/0103/context/maimone.html |title=(Tony Maimone) context / w b u r g |website=Wburg.com |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref> The group's name is a reference to ''[[Ubu Roi]]'', an [[avant-garde]] play by French writer [[Alfred Jarry]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/pere-ubu-mn0000838272/biography|title=Pere Ubu Biography|last=Ankeny|first=Jason|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nPere Ubu's debut single (their first four records were singles on their own \"Hearthan\" label) was \"30 Seconds Over Tokyo\" (inspired by the \"[[Doolittle Raid]]\" and named after a film depicting the raid), backed with \"Heart of Darkness\"; followed by \"Final Solution\" in 1976. One review noted that \"30 Seconds\" \"was clearly the work of a [[garage band]], yet its arty dissonance and weird experimentalism were startlingly unique.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/t3128186 |title=30 Seconds Over Tokyo |website=AllMusic |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Other recordings of the 1970s====\n\"Street Waves\" b/w \"My Dark Ages (I Don't Get Around)\" was their third single, and after their fourth single, \"The Modern Dance\" b/w 'Heaven\" (which was pressed in very small quantities and contained a completely different mix of \"Modern Dance\" from the album version), Pere Ubu signed to Blank Records, a short-lived imprint of [[Mercury Records]].\n\nLaughner left the group after their first two singles, and died soon afterwards of acute pancreatic failure. [[Tony Maimone]] signed on as bassist after Tim Wright left to join [[DNA (American band)|DNA]].\n\nTheir debut album, ''[[The Modern Dance]]'' (1978), sold poorly, but has proven influential. Musicians of many types, including [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock]], [[post punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]], were influenced by the dark, abstract record. With the song \"Sentimental Journey,\" the debut also introduced the practice of re-appropriating titles from well-known popular songs: Pere Ubu's \"Sentimental Journey\" has no obvious relation to the [[Doris Day]] [[Sentimental Journey (song)|hit song of the same name]]; \"Drinking Wine Spodyody\" has no apparent connection to the Sticks McGhee song (later revived by [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]). This practice has continued through 2006's ''[[Why I Hate Women]]'', which has a song called \"Blue Velvet\" (again, no relation to the [[Blue Velvet (song)|1963 hit song]] by [[Bobby Vinton]]).\n\nWhile most synthesizer players tended to play the instrument as they would a [[piano]] or [[organ (music)|organ]], Ravenstine generally opted instead to make sounds that were reminiscent of spooky sound effects from 1950s science fiction films, or perhaps [[electronic music]] and [[musique concr\u00e8te]]. One critic writes that Ravenstine \"may be one of the all-time great synth players\" <ref>{{cite web|last=Dougan |first=John |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r15032/review |title=Dub Housing \u2013 Pere Ubu |website=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-17}}</ref> and his playing has been called \"utterly original\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=pere_ubu|title=Pere Ubu|last=Sprague|first=David|last2=Robbins|first2=Ira|date=|website=[[Trouser Press]]|accessdate=January 7, 2007|last3=Grant|first3=Steven}}</ref>\n\nPere Ubu's second and third albums, ''[[Dub Housing]]'' and ''[[New Picnic Time]]'', followed with much the same reaction.\n\nThe group briefly disbanded in 1979, but reformed soon afterwards with Herman replaced by [[Mayo Thompson]] (of [[Red Krayola]]).\n\n===1980s===\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=July 2019}}\n''[[The Art of Walking]]'' (1980) featured [[Red Krayola]]'s [[Mayo Thompson]] on guitar. For the next original album, ''[[Song of the Bailing Man]]'' (1982), Krauss was replaced by [[Anton Fier]].\n\nThe group disbanded again soon afterwards; Krauss and Maimone formed Home and Garden, while Thomas worked on a solo career, notably with [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and with members of [[Henry Cow]].\n\nBy the late 1980s, one of Thomas's solo projects eventually featured much of Pere Ubu. The band was reformed again in 1987, with [[Jim Jones (guitarist)|Jim Jones]] and [[Chris Cutler]] joining for the release of ''[[The Tenement Year]]'' (1988), a far more pop-oriented album than ever before. The following year, \"Waiting for Mary\" (off ''[[Cloudland (album)|Cloudland]]'') appeared on [[MTV]] briefly. After the recording of ''[[Cloudland (album)|Cloudland]]'', Ravenstine left the group (although he made a guest appearance on ''[[Worlds in Collision (album)|Worlds in Collision]]'') and later became an airline pilot. [[Eric Drew Feldman]] joined the band in time for the Cloudland tour and the recording of ''Worlds in Collision'' but left afterwards, joining [[Frank Black]].\n\n===1990s and beyond===\n[[File:Pere Ubu @ Band On The Wall, Manchester 18-4-2013 (8661542521).jpg|thumb|200px|David Thomas of Pere Ubu on stage at Band On The Wall, Manchester, 18 April 2013]]\n''[[Story of My Life (album)|Story of My Life]]'' (1993) was released; Maimone left (once again) to join [[They Might Be Giants]], and Michele Temple and Garo Yellin joined the band for the ''[[Story of My Life (album)|Story of My Life]]'' tour and feature on Ubu's 1995 album, ''[[Ray Gun Suitcase]]''. Robert Wheeler has played [[synthesizer]] and [[theremin]] with Pere Ubu since 1994. Krauss left the band during the ''[[Ray Gun Suitcase]]'' sessions. For the ''[[Ray Gun Suitcase]]'' tour, guitarist Jim Jones departed as a ''touring'' member (although he continued to contribute to recordings), founding guitarist Tom Herman replaced him for the tour.\n\nConcurrent with the 1996 release of the ''[[Datapanik in Year Zero]]'' box set, Jim Jones retired due to health problems. Tom Herman returned to the band after a twenty-year absence to tour with the band in 1995, and went on to record ''[[Pennsylvania (album)|Pennsylvania]]'' (1998) and ''[[St. Arkansas]]'' in 2002. Jim Jones contributed guitar tracks to each album as well, and guitarist [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]] of [[MC5]] fame joined the band for their 1998 summer tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114112624/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pereubu/articles/story/5921199/wayne_kramer_joins_pere_ubu|title=Wayne Kramer Joins Pere Ubu|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=September 3, 2019}}</ref> Herman left again in 2005, being replaced by [[Keith Molin\u00e9]], of David Thomas's \"solo\" group [[David Thomas and Two Pale Boys|Two Pale Boys]].

Despite a variety of long-term band members, singer [[David Thomas (musician)|David Thomas]] is the only constant. They released their debut album ''[[The Modern Dance]]'' in 1978 and followed with several more LPs before disbanding in 1982. Thomas reformed the group in 1987, continuing to record and tour.\n\nDescribing their sound as \"avant-garage,\" Pere Ubu's work drew inspiration from sources such as [[musique concr\u00e8te]], [[rock music#Early 1960s|60s rock]], [[performance art]], and the [[industrial region|industrial environments]] of the American [[Midwest]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Simon|last=Reynolds |authorlink=Simon Reynolds |title=Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978\u20131984  |publisher=[[Faber and Faber]] |location=London, England|year=2005|isbn=978-0-571-21570-6 |ref=harv|title-link=Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978\u20131984 }}</ref><ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Boehm|title=POP: Pere Ubu still driven by an innovative spirit|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-06-13/news/ol-1020_1_pere-ubu|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 13, 1991|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}</ref> While the band achieved little commercial success, they have exerted a wide influence on subsequent [[underground music]].<ref name=allmusic/>\n\n==History==\n===1970s===\n[[Rocket from the Tombs]] was a Cleveland-based group that eventually fragmented: some members formed [[The Dead Boys]], and others The Saucers, while [[David Thomas (musician)|David Thomas]] and guitarist [[Peter Laughner]] joined with guitarist Tom Herman, bass guitarist [[Tim Wright (bassist)|Tim Wright]], drummer [[Scott Krauss]] and synthesist [[Allen Ravenstine]] to form Pere Ubu in 1975.

One review noted that \"30 Seconds\" \"was clearly the work of a [[garage band]], yet its arty dissonance and weird experimentalism were startlingly unique.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/t3128186 |title=30 Seconds Over Tokyo |website=AllMusic |accessdate=July 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Other recordings of the 1970s====\n\"Street Waves\" b/w \"My Dark Ages (I Don't Get Around)\" was their third single, and after their fourth single, \"The Modern Dance\" b/w 'Heaven\" (which was pressed in very small quantities and contained a completely different mix of \"Modern Dance\" from the album version), Pere Ubu signed to Blank Records, a short-lived imprint of [[Mercury Records]].\n\nLaughner left the group after their first two singles, and died soon afterwards of acute pancreatic failure. [[Tony Maimone]] signed on as bassist after Tim Wright left to join [[DNA (American band)|DNA]].\n\nTheir debut album, ''[[The Modern Dance]]'' (1978), sold poorly, but has proven influential. Musicians of many types, including [[progressive rock]], [[punk rock]], [[post punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]], were influenced by the dark, abstract record. With the song \"Sentimental Journey,\" the debut also introduced the practice of re-appropriating titles from well-known popular songs: Pere Ubu's \"Sentimental Journey\" has no obvious relation to the [[Doris Day]] [[Sentimental Journey (song)|hit song of the same name]]; \"Drinking Wine Spodyody\" has no apparent connection to the Sticks McGhee song (later revived by [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]). This practice has continued through 2006's ''[[Why I Hate Women]]'', which has a song called \"Blue Velvet\" (again, no relation to the [[Blue Velvet (song)|1963 hit song]] by [[Bobby Vinton]]).\n\nWhile most synthesizer players tended to play the instrument as they would a [[piano]] or [[organ (music)|organ]], Ravenstine generally opted instead to make sounds that were reminiscent of spooky sound effects from 1950s science fiction films, or perhaps [[electronic music]] and [[musique concr\u00e8te]]. One critic writes that Ravenstine \"may be one of the all-time great synth players\" <ref>{{cite web|last=Dougan |first=John |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/r15032/review |title=Dub Housing \u2013 Pere Ubu |website=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2011-07-17}}</ref> and his playing has been called \"utterly original\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=pere_ubu|title=Pere Ubu|last=Sprague|first=David|last2=Robbins|first2=Ira|date=|website=[[Trouser Press]]|accessdate=January 7, 2007|last3=Grant|first3=Steven}}</ref>\n\nPere Ubu's second and third albums, ''[[Dub Housing]]'' and ''[[New Picnic Time]]'', followed with much the same reaction.\n\nThe group briefly disbanded in 1979, but reformed soon afterwards with Herman replaced by [[Mayo Thompson]] (of [[Red Krayola]]).\n\n===1980s===\n{{Unreferenced|section|date=July 2019}}\n''[[The Art of Walking]]'' (1980) featured [[Red Krayola]]'s [[Mayo Thompson]] on guitar. For the next original album, ''[[Song of the Bailing Man]]'' (1982), Krauss was replaced by [[Anton Fier]].\n\nThe group disbanded again soon afterwards; Krauss and Maimone formed Home and Garden, while Thomas worked on a solo career, notably with [[Richard Thompson (musician)|Richard Thompson]] and with members of [[Henry Cow]].\n\nBy the late 1980s, one of Thomas's solo projects eventually featured much of Pere Ubu. The band was reformed again in 1987, with [[Jim Jones (guitarist)|Jim Jones]] and [[Chris Cutler]] joining for the release of ''[[The Tenement Year]]'' (1988), a far more pop-oriented album than ever before. The following year, \"Waiting for Mary\" (off ''[[Cloudland (album)|Cloudland]]'') appeared on [[MTV]] briefly. After the recording of ''[[Cloudland (album)|Cloudland]]'', Ravenstine left the group (although he made a guest appearance on ''[[Worlds in Collision (album)|Worlds in Collision]]'') and later became an airline pilot. [[Eric Drew Feldman]] joined the band in time for the Cloudland tour and the recording of ''Worlds in Collision'' but left afterwards, joining [[Frank Black]].\n\n===1990s and beyond===\n[[File:Pere Ubu @ Band On The Wall, Manchester 18-4-2013 (8661542521).jpg|thumb|200px|David Thomas of Pere Ubu on stage at Band On The Wall, Manchester, 18 April 2013]]\n''[[Story of My Life (album)|Story of My Life]]'' (1993) was released; Maimone left (once again) to join [[They Might Be Giants]], and Michele Temple and Garo Yellin joined the band for the ''[[Story of My Life (album)|Story of My Life]]'' tour and feature on Ubu's 1995 album, ''[[Ray Gun Suitcase]]''.

For the ''[[Ray Gun Suitcase]]'' tour, guitarist Jim Jones departed as a ''touring'' member (although he continued to contribute to recordings), founding guitarist Tom Herman replaced him for the tour.\n\nConcurrent with the 1996 release of the ''[[Datapanik in Year Zero]]'' box set, Jim Jones retired due to health problems. Tom Herman returned to the band after a twenty-year absence to tour with the band in 1995, and went on to record ''[[Pennsylvania (album)|Pennsylvania]]'' (1998) and ''[[St. Arkansas]]'' in 2002.

Their propulsive rhythmic pulse was similar to [[Krautrock]], but Thomas's yelping, howling, desperate singing was and still is peculiar when compared to most other rock and roll singers.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Dougan |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/dub-housing-mw0000653257 |title=Dub Housing \u2013 Pere Ubu &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Personnel==\n;Current members<ref>{{cite web | title = The Pere Ubu Time Line| website=Ubuprojex.com|url = http://www.ubuprojex.com/faqs/timeline.html | accessdate = April 3, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[David Thomas (musician)|David Thomas]] \u2013 lead vocals, keyboards, melodeon, musette, theremin <small>(1975\u201382, 1987\u2013present)</small>\n* Michele Temple \u2013 bass, guitar <small>(1993\u2013present)</small>\n* Robert Wheeler \u2013 synthesizer, theremin <small>(1994\u201399, 1999-2007, 2009-present)</small>\n* [[Keith Molin\u00e9]] \u2013 guitar <small>(2002, 2005\u201316, 2016\u2013present)</small>\n* Gagarin \u2013 synthesizer, electronics <small>(2007\u201316, 2016\u2013present)</small>\n* [[Chris Cutler]] \u2013 drums, electronics <small>(1987\u201390, 2004, 2019-present)</small>\n* P.O.

Dr. [[Hubert L. Eaton|Hubert Eaton]] and C. B. Sims entered into a sales contract with the cemetery in 1912. Eaton took over the management of the cemetery in 1917. Although Eaton did not start Forest Lawn Cemetery, he is credited as being the \"Founder\" of Forest Lawn Memorial-Park for his innovations of establishing the \"memorial-park plan\" (eliminating upright grave markers and bringing in works by established artists) and being the first to open a funeral home on dedicated cemetery grounds. Eaton was a firm believer in a joyous life after death.  He was convinced that most cemeteries were \"unsightly, depressing stoneyards\" and pledged to create one that would reflect his optimistic, Christian beliefs, \"as unlike other cemeteries as sunshine is unlike darkness.\" He envisioned Forest Lawn to be \"a great park devoid of misshapen monuments and other signs of earthly death, but filled with towering trees, sweeping lawns, splashing fountains, beautiful statuary, and ... memorial architecture.\"<ref>Llewellyn, John F. (2018).

Dr. [[Hubert L. Eaton|Hubert Eaton]] and C. B. Sims entered into a sales contract with the cemetery in 1912. Eaton took over the management of the cemetery in 1917. Although Eaton did not start Forest Lawn Cemetery, he is credited as being the \"Founder\" of Forest Lawn Memorial-Park for his innovations of establishing the \"memorial-park plan\" (eliminating upright grave markers and bringing in works by established artists) and being the first to open a funeral home on dedicated cemetery grounds. Eaton was a firm believer in a joyous life after death.  He was convinced that most cemeteries were \"unsightly, depressing stoneyards\" and pledged to create one that would reflect his optimistic, Christian beliefs, \"as unlike other cemeteries as sunshine is unlike darkness.\" He envisioned Forest Lawn to be \"a great park devoid of misshapen monuments and other signs of earthly death, but filled with towering trees, sweeping lawns, splashing fountains, beautiful statuary, and ... memorial architecture.\"<ref>Llewellyn, John F.

It was released as a download on 8 November 2018 through [[Vertigo Records]] and [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] as the third single from his second extended play, [[Breach (Lewis Capaldi EP)|''Breach'']] (2018), and was later included on his debut album, ''[[Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent]]'' (2019). The song was written by Capaldi, [[Romans (musician)|Samuel Romans]], and its producers [[TMS (production team)|Thomas Barnes]], [[TMS (production team)|Peter Kelleher]] and [[TMS (production team)|Benjamin Kohn]].\n\n\"Someone You Loved\" was a commercial success, peaking at number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

In the United States, \"Someone You Loved\" was a [[sleeper hit]], topping the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in its 24th week on the chart.

Through Learning Links, Shenton College students have special access to the University of Western Australia and its facilities. For example, the Academic Focus Group students, selected for their outstanding academic potential in Year 11 and 12, are inducted to the UWA Library and have borrowing rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning_links|title= Learning Links|accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nShenton College is built on a {{convert|33|acre|ha|0}} site bounded by Lemnos Street, Selby Street and Stubbs Terrace. The campus is adjacent to the [[Shenton Park railway station]] ([[Fremantle railway line|Fremantle line]]).\n\nThe College buildings are curved, of a light limestone with colourful interior walls. There are plants and trees dotted about everywhere and several courtyards and grassed areas within the main building areas. There are pieces of local art (a requirement of the College's construction) in various places around the school grounds.\n\nThe school also includes a number of heritage buildings, including Borneo and Alamein House, which have been internally renovated for use as classrooms.\n\nThere are two main school ovals, one in front (near the Senior School) and one near the Middle School. In a joint enterprise with the [[University of Western Australia]] and other assorted agencies, there is also a new artificial hockey turf near Gallipoli and Borneo houses.\n\n==Statistics==\nYear 12

For example, the Academic Focus Group students, selected for their outstanding academic potential in Year 11 and 12, are inducted to the UWA Library and have borrowing rights.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.studentservices.uwa.edu.au/ss/learning_links|title= Learning Links|accessdate=25 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Campus==\nShenton College is built on a {{convert|33|acre|ha|0}} site bounded by Lemnos Street, Selby Street and Stubbs Terrace. The campus is adjacent to the [[Shenton Park railway station]] ([[Fremantle railway line|Fremantle line]]).\n\nThe College buildings are curved, of a light limestone with colourful interior walls. There are plants and trees dotted about everywhere and several courtyards and grassed areas within the main building areas. There are pieces of local art (a requirement of the College's construction) in various places around the school grounds.\n\nThe school also includes a number of heritage buildings, including Borneo and Alamein House, which have been internally renovated for use as classrooms.\n\nThere are two main school ovals, one in front (near the Senior School) and one near the Middle School.
