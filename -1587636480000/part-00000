Twenty aircraft were built, including six prototypes and development aircraft. [[Air France]] (AF) and [[British Airways]] (BA) were the only airlines to purchase and fly Concorde. The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could afford to pay a high price in exchange for the aircraft's speed and luxury service.

With only [[Concorde aircraft histories|seven airframes each]] being operated by the British and French, the per-unit cost was impossible to recoup, so the French and British governments absorbed the development costs. British Airways and Air France were able to operate Concorde at a profit, in spite of very high maintenance costs, because the aircraft was able to sustain a high ticket price.\n\nAmong other [[#Scheduled flights|destinations]], Concorde flew regular [[transatlantic flight]]s from London's [[Heathrow Airport]] and Paris's [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York, [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Virginia and [[Grantley Adams International Airport]] in Barbados; it flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners.\n\nConcorde won the 2006 Great British Design Quest, organised by the BBC and the [[Design Museum]] of London, beating other well-known designs such as the [[BMC Mini]], the [[miniskirt]], the [[Jaguar E-Type]], the [[London Tube map]] and the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. The type was retired in 2003, three years after the crash of [[Air France Flight 4590]], in which all passengers and crew were killed. The general downturn in the commercial aviation industry after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and the end of maintenance support for Concorde by [[Airbus]] (the successor company of both A\u00e9rospatiale and BAC) also contributed to the retirement.<ref name=\"BBC Concorde Grounded\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title=Concorde grounded for good |work=BBC News |date=10 April 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Early studies===\nThe origins of the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, when [[Arnold Hall]], director of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) asked [[Morien Morgan]] to form a committee to study the supersonic transport (SST) concept. The group met for the first time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=35}}\n\nAt the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.<ref group=N>In particular, R. T. Jones' work at NACA demonstrated this in depth.</ref> This led to the use of very short-span, very thin trapezoidal wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] or the [[Avro 730]] that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nThis same short span produced very little lift at low speed, which resulted in extremely long take-off runs and frighteningly high landing speeds.<ref>\nJan Meyer, [http://starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html \"High altitude flying with F-104\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103071113/http://www.starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html |date=3 January 2014}}, Starfighterens veneer Norge.</ref> In an SST design, this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways, and to provide the fuel needed, \"some horribly large aeroplanes\" resulted.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Based on this, the group considered the concept of an SST infeasible, and instead suggested continued low-level studies into supersonic aerodynamics.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\n===Slender deltas===\nSoon after, [[Johanna Weber]] and [[Dietrich K\u00fcchemann]] at the RAE published a series of reports on a new wing [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]], known in the UK as the \"slender delta\" concept.<ref name='deltawing'>{{cite journal|url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723|title=The development of the slender delta concept|journal=Aircraft Engineering|author=Maltby, R.L.|volume=40|issue=3|pages=12\u201317|date=1968|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526165008/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723&setcookie=yes|archivedate=26 May 2013|doi=10.1108/eb034350}}</ref><ref name=aerosoc>{{cite web |url=http://aerosociety.com/News/Society-News/2742/OBITUARY-DR-JOHANNA-WEBER|title=Obituary: Dr Johanna Weber|publisher=[[Royal Aeronautical Society]]|date=12 January 2015|last=Green |first=John}}</ref> The team, including Eric Maskell whose report \"Flow Separation in Three Dimensions\" contributed to an understanding of the physical nature of separated flow,<ref>''Three Centuries To Concorde'', Charles Burnet, Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, {{ISBN|0 85298 412 X}}, p.236</ref> worked with the fact that [[delta wing]]s can produce strong [[vortex|vortices]] on their upper surfaces at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by [[Chuck Yeager]] in the [[Convair XF-92]], but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.<ref name=aerosoc />{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nK\u00fcchemann's and Weber's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design almost overnight. Although the delta had already been used on aircraft prior to this point, these designs used planforms that were not much different from a [[swept wing]] of the same span.<ref group=N>Consider especially the [[English Electric Lightning]], whose wing can be considered either a highly swept rectangle, or a delta with a notch cut out of the root.</ref> Weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over, which suggested that the effect would be maximised by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible. Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span, while also offering reasonable take-off and landing speeds using vortex generation.<ref name=aerosoc /> The only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to take off and land very \"nose high\" to generate the required vortex lift, which led to questions about the low speed handling qualities of such a design.<ref name=brown /> It would also need to have long [[landing gear]] to produce the required angle of attack while still on the runway.\n\nK\u00fcchemann presented the idea at a meeting where Morgan was also present. Test pilot [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] recalls Morgan's reaction to the presentation, saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the SST problem. Brown considers this moment as being the true birth of the Concorde project.<ref name=brown>Eric Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MMEK1jwD03AC&pg=PT121 \"Wings On My Sleeve\"], Hachette UK, 2008, end of Chapter 12</ref>\n\n===Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee===\n[[File:HP.115.gif|thumb|right|The HP.115 tested the low-speed performance of the slender delta layout.]]\n\nOn 1 October 1956 the [[Ministry of Supply]] asked Morgan to form a new study group, the ''Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee'' (''STAC''){{sfn|Conway|2005|p=39}} (sometimes referred to as the ''Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee''), with the explicit goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, the decision was made to fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the [[Handley Page HP.115]].<ref name=brown /> This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as {{convert|69|mph|abbr=on}}, about {{sfrac|1|3}} that of the F-104 Starfighter.{{sfn|Winchester|2005b|p=134}}\n\nSTAC stated that an SST would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, they would be able to fly more [[sorties]] in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nSTAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan suggested that a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about \u00a375 to \u00a390&nbsp;million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps \u00a350 to \u00a380&nbsp;million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=68}}\n\nIn 1959, a study contract was awarded to [[Hawker Siddeley]] and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept,{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}} which developed as the [[Hawker Siddeley HSA.1000|HSA.1000]] and [[Bristol Type 223#STAC|Bristol 198]]. [[Armstrong Whitworth]] also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and after the creation of [[British Aircraft Corporation]] in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Douglas Aircraft]] and [[Sud Aviation]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}\n\n===Ogee planform selected===\nK\u00fcchemann and others at the RAE continued their work on the slender delta throughout this period, considering three basic shapes; the classic straight-edge delta, the \"gothic delta\" that was rounded outwards to appear like a [[Gothic architecture#Equilateral arch|gothic arch]], and the \"[[ogive|ogival]] wing\" that was compound-rounded into the shape of an [[ogee]]. Each of these planforms had its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of aerodynamics. As they worked with these shapes, a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}\n\nGenerally one wants to have the wing's [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] (CP, or \"lift point\") close to the aircraft's [[centre of gravity]] (CG, or \"balance point\") to reduce the amount of control force required to [[Pitch axis (kinematics)|pitch]] the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this.<ref group=N>Or, more rarely, \"bent\" back into position. Examples include the [[Douglas DC-3]] and [[Messerschmitt Me 262]].</ref> With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Bristol Type 223 top-view silhouette.png|thumb|200px|right|Plan-view silhouette of the Bristol Type 223 SST project]]\n\nWhile the wing planform was evolving, so was the basic SST concept. Bristol's original Type 198 was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing,<ref>J. S. Thompson and R. A. Fail, [http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0815.pdf \"Measurements of Oscillatory Derivatives at Mach Numbers up to 2.6 on a Model of a Supersonic Transport Design Study (Bristol Type 198)\"], RAE Bedford, 1964.</ref> but evolved into the larger [[Bristol Type 223|Type 223]].\n\nTo test the new wing, NASA privately assisted the team by modifying a [[Douglas F5D Skylancer]] with temporary wing modifications to mimic the wing selection. In 1965 the NASA test aircraft successfully tested the wing, and found that it reduced landing speeds noticeably over the standard delta wing. NASA Ames test center also ran simulations which showed that the aircraft would suffer a sudden change in pitch when entering ground effect. Ames test pilots later participated in a joint cooperative test with the French and British test pilots and found that the simulations had been correct, and this information was added to pilot training.<ref>Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center.

P.38</ref>\n\n===Partnership with Sud Aviation===\nBy this time similar political and economic concerns in France<!-- do not link major countries--> had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and [[Nord Aviation]], as well as [[Dassault]].<ref group=N>This apparently took place some time in 1957, according to Conway's unclear statement about \"the following year\" which apparently references the first STAC meeting in late 1956.</ref> All three returned designs based on K\u00fcchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a [[ramjet]] powered design flying at Mach 3, the other two were jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the [[Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle]] won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nAs soon as the design was complete, in April 1960, Pierre Satre, the company's technical director, was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership. Bristol was surprised to find that the Sud team had designed a very similar aircraft after considering the SST problem and coming to the very same conclusions as the Bristol and STAC teams in terms of economics. It was later revealed that the original STAC report, marked \"For UK Eyes Only\", had secretly been passed to the French to win political favour. Sud made minor changes to the paper, and presented it as their own work.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=49}}\n\nUnsurprisingly, the two teams found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already concluded they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]]).{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=47}} As neither company had experience in the use of high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used&nbsp;\u2013 above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that K\u00fcchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nThe only disagreements were over the size and range. The UK team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved not to be the barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=41}} The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time it was clear that the two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More powerful [[Rolls-Royce Olympus|Bristol Siddeley Olympus]] engines, being developed for the [[TSR-2]], allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=50}}\n\n===Cabinet response, treaty===\nWhile the development teams met, French Minister of Public Works and Transport [[Robert Buron]] was meeting with the UK Minister of Aviation [[Peter Thorneycroft]], and Thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the French were much more serious about a partnership than any of the US companies.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}} The various US companies had proved uninterested in such a venture, likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company, and the risk of \"giving away\" US technological leadership to a European partner.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}\n\nWhen the STAC plans were presented to the UK cabinet, a very negative reaction resulted. The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be \u00a3150&nbsp;million, which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting that there was no way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that \"the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including the recent history of the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the \u00a3150&nbsp;million [cost] to turn out much too low.\"{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}\n\nThis concern led to an independent review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered for the simple reason that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}\n\nAfter considerable argument, the decision to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the [[European Common Market]], which was being controlled by [[Charles de Gaulle]] who felt the UK's [[Special Relationship]] with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would pave the way for Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}} It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}}\n\nThe development project was negotiated as an international treaty between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft treaty was signed on 29 November 1962.<ref name=\"earlyhist\">[http://www.concordesst.com/history/eh1.html#a \"Early History.\"] concordesst.com.

The British government had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot to cancel the service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, [[John King, Baron King of Wartnaby|Sir John King]], convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then [[Nationalization|state-owned]] British Airways for \u00a316.5&nbsp;million plus the first year's profits.<ref>Backroom boys&nbsp;\u2013 Francis Spufford</ref><ref name= 'concewhitele'>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/632500842.html?dids=632500842:632500842&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Apr+01%2C+1984&author=&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=The+plane+fact+is%2C+Concorde+has+broken+the+profit+barrier+for+the+first+time&pqatl=google |title=The plane fact is, Concorde has broken the profit barrier for the first time |work=Chicago Tribune |first= Peter |last= Greenberg |accessdate=30 June 2011 |date=1 April 1984}}</ref> In 2003, Lord [[Michael Heseltine|Heseltine]], who was the Minister responsible at the time, revealed to Alan Robb on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], that the aircraft had been sold for \"next to nothing\".

This fragment punctured a tyre<!-- please leave British spelling of \"tyres\" on British/French aircraft ---> on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a sudden descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the H\u00f4telissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.{{sfn|Endres|2001|pp=110\u2013113}}\n\nThe claim that a metallic strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses (including the pilot of then [[French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]]'s aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when Flight 4590 caught fire) and by an independent French TV investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left-side main gear and that the plane caught fire some 1,000 feet from where the metallic strip lay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectator.org/print/39656|title=What Price Supersonic Grandeur?|date=28 March 2016|accessdate=21 December 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328150841/http://spectator.org/print/39656|archivedate=28 March 2016}}</ref> British investigators and former French Concorde pilots looked at several other possibilities that the BEA report ignored, including an unbalanced weight distribution in the fuel tanks and loose landing gear.

The UK's [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] (AAIB) concluded that the skin of the rudder had been separating from the rudder structure over a period of time before the accident due to moisture seepage past the [[rivet]]s in the rudder. Furthermore, production staff had not followed proper procedures during an earlier modification of the rudder, but the procedures were difficult to adhere to.<ref name=AAIB89 /> The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.<ref name=AAIB89 />\n* 21 March 1992: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAB, on a scheduled flight from London to New York, also suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. While cruising at Mach 2, at approximately 53,000 feet above mean sea level, the crew heard a \"thump\". No difficulties in handling were noticed, and no instruments gave any irregular indications. This crew also suspected there had been a minor engine surge. One hour later, during descent and while decelerating below Mach 1.4, a sudden \"severe\" vibration began throughout the aircraft.<ref name=AAIB93 /> The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine, and it was attenuated when that engine's power was reduced. The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York, noting only that increased rudder control was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course. Again, the skin had become separated from the structure of the rudder, which led to most of the upper rudder becoming separated in-flight. The AAIB concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair, weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder, leading to it breaking up in-flight. The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure, and prior to this accident, the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated.<ref name=AAIB93 />\n* The 2010 trial involving [[Continental Airlines]] over the crash of Flight 4590 established that from 1976 until Flight 4590 there had been 57 tyre failures involving Concordes during takeoffs, including a near-crash at [[Dulles Airport]] on 14 June 1979 involving Air France Flight 54 where a tyre blowout pierced the plane's fuel tank and damaged the port-side engine and electrical cables, with the loss of two of the craft's hydraulic systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spectator.org/print/39656|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328150841/http://spectator.org/print/39656|url-status=dead|title=Joseph A.

Twenty aircraft were built, including six prototypes and development aircraft. [[Air France]] (AF) and [[British Airways]] (BA) were the only airlines to purchase and fly Concorde. The aircraft was used mainly by wealthy passengers who could afford to pay a high price in exchange for the aircraft's speed and luxury service. For example, in 1997, the round-trip ticket price from New York to London was $7,995 (${{format price|{{Inflation|US|8e3|1997}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars),{{Inflation-fn|US}} more than 30 times the cost of the cheapest option to fly this route.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=F2D_CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1 ''New Design Concepts for High Speed Air Transport''] edited by H.

With only [[Concorde aircraft histories|seven airframes each]] being operated by the British and French, the per-unit cost was impossible to recoup, so the French and British governments absorbed the development costs. British Airways and Air France were able to operate Concorde at a profit, in spite of very high maintenance costs, because the aircraft was able to sustain a high ticket price.\n\nAmong other [[#Scheduled flights|destinations]], Concorde flew regular [[transatlantic flight]]s from London's [[Heathrow Airport]] and Paris's [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York, [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] in Virginia and [[Grantley Adams International Airport]] in Barbados; it flew these routes in less than half the time of other airliners.\n\nConcorde won the 2006 Great British Design Quest, organised by the BBC and the [[Design Museum]] of London, beating other well-known designs such as the [[BMC Mini]], the [[miniskirt]], the [[Jaguar E-Type]], the [[London Tube map]] and the [[Supermarine Spitfire]]. The type was retired in 2003, three years after the crash of [[Air France Flight 4590]], in which all passengers and crew were killed. The general downturn in the commercial aviation industry after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 and the end of maintenance support for Concorde by [[Airbus]] (the successor company of both A\u00e9rospatiale and BAC) also contributed to the retirement.<ref name=\"BBC Concorde Grounded\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2934257.stm |title=Concorde grounded for good |work=BBC News |date=10 April 2003 |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\n===Early studies===\nThe origins of the Concorde project date to the early 1950s, when [[Arnold Hall]], director of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) asked [[Morien Morgan]] to form a committee to study the supersonic transport (SST) concept. The group met for the first time in February 1954 and delivered their first report in April 1955.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=35}}\n\nAt the time it was known that the drag at supersonic speeds was strongly related to the span of the wing.<ref group=N>In particular, R. T. Jones' work at NACA demonstrated this in depth.</ref> This led to the use of very short-span, very thin trapezoidal wings such as those seen on the control surfaces of many missiles, or in aircraft like the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]] or the [[Avro 730]] that the team studied. The team outlined a baseline configuration that looked like an enlarged Avro 730.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nThis same short span produced very little lift at low speed, which resulted in extremely long take-off runs and frighteningly high landing speeds.<ref>\nJan Meyer, [http://starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html \"High altitude flying with F-104\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140103071113/http://www.starfighter.no/web/hi-alt.html |date=3 January 2014}}, Starfighterens veneer Norge.</ref> In an SST design, this would have required enormous engine power to lift off from existing runways, and to provide the fuel needed, \"some horribly large aeroplanes\" resulted.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Based on this, the group considered the concept of an SST infeasible, and instead suggested continued low-level studies into supersonic aerodynamics.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\n===Slender deltas===\nSoon after, [[Johanna Weber]] and [[Dietrich K\u00fcchemann]] at the RAE published a series of reports on a new wing [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]], known in the UK as the \"slender delta\" concept.<ref name='deltawing'>{{cite journal|url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723|title=The development of the slender delta concept|journal=Aircraft Engineering|author=Maltby, R.L.|volume=40|issue=3|pages=12\u201317|date=1968|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526165008/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&collection=TRD&recid=A6825061AH&q=Concorde+Delta&uid=788872723&setcookie=yes|archivedate=26 May 2013|doi=10.1108/eb034350}}</ref><ref name=aerosoc>{{cite web |url=http://aerosociety.com/News/Society-News/2742/OBITUARY-DR-JOHANNA-WEBER|title=Obituary: Dr Johanna Weber|publisher=[[Royal Aeronautical Society]]|date=12 January 2015|last=Green |first=John}}</ref> The team, including Eric Maskell whose report \"Flow Separation in Three Dimensions\" contributed to an understanding of the physical nature of separated flow,<ref>''Three Centuries To Concorde'', Charles Burnet, Mechanical Engineering Publications Limited, {{ISBN|0 85298 412 X}}, p.236</ref> worked with the fact that [[delta wing]]s can produce strong [[vortex|vortices]] on their upper surfaces at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} The vortex will lower the air pressure and cause lift to be greatly increased. This effect had been noticed earlier, notably by [[Chuck Yeager]] in the [[Convair XF-92]], but its qualities had not been fully appreciated. Weber suggested that this was no mere curiosity, and the effect could be deliberately used to improve low speed performance.<ref name=aerosoc />{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nK\u00fcchemann's and Weber's papers changed the entire nature of supersonic design almost overnight. Although the delta had already been used on aircraft prior to this point, these designs used planforms that were not much different from a [[swept wing]] of the same span.<ref group=N>Consider especially the [[English Electric Lightning]], whose wing can be considered either a highly swept rectangle, or a delta with a notch cut out of the root.</ref> Weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over, which suggested that the effect would be maximised by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible. Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span, while also offering reasonable take-off and landing speeds using vortex generation.<ref name=aerosoc /> The only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to take off and land very \"nose high\" to generate the required vortex lift, which led to questions about the low speed handling qualities of such a design.<ref name=brown /> It would also need to have long [[landing gear]] to produce the required angle of attack while still on the runway.\n\nK\u00fcchemann presented the idea at a meeting where Morgan was also present. Test pilot [[Eric Brown (pilot)|Eric Brown]] recalls Morgan's reaction to the presentation, saying that he immediately seized on it as the solution to the SST problem. Brown considers this moment as being the true birth of the Concorde project.<ref name=brown>Eric Brown, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MMEK1jwD03AC&pg=PT121 \"Wings On My Sleeve\"], Hachette UK, 2008, end of Chapter 12</ref>\n\n===Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee===\n[[File:HP.115.gif|thumb|right|The HP.115 tested the low-speed performance of the slender delta layout.]]\n\nOn 1 October 1956 the [[Ministry of Supply]] asked Morgan to form a new study group, the ''Supersonic Transport Aircraft Committee'' (''STAC''){{sfn|Conway|2005|p=39}} (sometimes referred to as the ''Supersonic Transport Advisory Committee''), with the explicit goal of developing a practical SST design and finding industry partners to build it. At the very first meeting, on 5 November 1956, the decision was made to fund the development of a test bed aircraft to examine the low-speed performance of the slender delta, a contract that eventually produced the [[Handley Page HP.115]].<ref name=brown /> This aircraft would ultimately demonstrate safe control at speeds as low as {{convert|69|mph|abbr=on}}, about {{sfrac|1|3}} that of the F-104 Starfighter.{{sfn|Winchester|2005b|p=134}}\n\nSTAC stated that an SST would have economic performance similar to existing subsonic types.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Although they would burn more fuel in cruise, they would be able to fly more [[sorties]] in a given period of time, so fewer aircraft would be needed to service a particular route. This would remain economically advantageous as long as fuel represented a small percentage of operational costs, as it did at the time.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}}\n\nSTAC suggested that two designs naturally fell out of their work, a transatlantic model flying at about Mach 2, and a shorter-range version flying at perhaps Mach 1.2. Morgan suggested that a 150-passenger transatlantic SST would cost about \u00a375 to \u00a390&nbsp;million to develop, and be in service in 1970. The smaller 100 passenger short-range version would cost perhaps \u00a350 to \u00a380&nbsp;million, and be ready for service in 1968. To meet this schedule, development would need to begin in 1960, with production contracts let in 1962.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=67}} Morgan strongly suggested that the US was already involved in a similar project, and that if the UK failed to respond it would be locked out of an airliner market that he believed would be dominated by SST aircraft.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=68}}\n\nIn 1959, a study contract was awarded to [[Hawker Siddeley]] and [[Bristol Aeroplane Company|Bristol]] for preliminary designs based on the slender delta concept,{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}} which developed as the [[Hawker Siddeley HSA.1000|HSA.1000]] and [[Bristol Type 223#STAC|Bristol 198]]. [[Armstrong Whitworth]] also responded with an internal design, the M-Wing, for the lower-speed shorter-range category. Even at this early time, both the STAC group and the government were looking for partners to develop the designs. In September 1959, Hawker approached [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], and after the creation of [[British Aircraft Corporation]] in 1960, the former Bristol team immediately started talks with [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], [[Douglas Aircraft]] and [[Sud Aviation]].{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}\n\n===Ogee planform selected===\nK\u00fcchemann and others at the RAE continued their work on the slender delta throughout this period, considering three basic shapes; the classic straight-edge delta, the \"gothic delta\" that was rounded outwards to appear like a [[Gothic architecture#Equilateral arch|gothic arch]], and the \"[[ogive|ogival]] wing\" that was compound-rounded into the shape of an [[ogee]]. Each of these planforms had its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of aerodynamics. As they worked with these shapes, a practical concern grew to become so important that it forced selection of one of these designs.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}\n\nGenerally one wants to have the wing's [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|centre of pressure]] (CP, or \"lift point\") close to the aircraft's [[centre of gravity]] (CG, or \"balance point\") to reduce the amount of control force required to [[Pitch axis (kinematics)|pitch]] the aircraft. As the aircraft layout changes during the design phase, it is common for the CG to move fore or aft. With a normal wing design this can be addressed by moving the wing slightly fore or aft to account for this.<ref group=N>Or, more rarely, \"bent\" back into position. Examples include the [[Douglas DC-3]] and [[Messerschmitt Me 262]].</ref> With a delta wing running most of the length of the fuselage, this was no longer easy; moving the wing would leave it in front of the nose or behind the tail. Studying the various layouts in terms of CG changes, both during design and changes due to fuel use during flight, the ogee planform immediately came to the fore.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=40}}\n\n[[File:Bristol Type 223 top-view silhouette.png|thumb|200px|right|Plan-view silhouette of the Bristol Type 223 SST project]]\n\nWhile the wing planform was evolving, so was the basic SST concept. Bristol's original Type 198 was a small design with an almost pure slender delta wing,<ref>J. S. Thompson and R. A. Fail, [http://naca.central.cranfield.ac.uk/reports/arc/cp/0815.pdf \"Measurements of Oscillatory Derivatives at Mach Numbers up to 2.6 on a Model of a Supersonic Transport Design Study (Bristol Type 198)\"], RAE Bedford, 1964.</ref> but evolved into the larger [[Bristol Type 223|Type 223]].\n\nTo test the new wing, NASA privately assisted the team by modifying a [[Douglas F5D Skylancer]] with temporary wing modifications to mimic the wing selection. In 1965 the NASA test aircraft successfully tested the wing, and found that it reduced landing speeds noticeably over the standard delta wing. NASA Ames test center also ran simulations which showed that the aircraft would suffer a sudden change in pitch when entering ground effect. Ames test pilots later participated in a joint cooperative test with the French and British test pilots and found that the simulations had been correct, and this information was added to pilot training.<ref>Memoirs of an aeronautical engineer: flight testing at Ames Research Center. Seth B. Anderson, United States. National Aeronautics and Space Administration. History Office, Ames Research Center. P.38</ref>\n\n===Partnership with Sud Aviation===\nBy this time similar political and economic concerns in France<!-- do not link major countries--> had led to their own SST plans. In the late 1950s the government requested designs from both the government-owned Sud Aviation and [[Nord Aviation]], as well as [[Dassault]].<ref group=N>This apparently took place some time in 1957, according to Conway's unclear statement about \"the following year\" which apparently references the first STAC meeting in late 1956.</ref> All three returned designs based on K\u00fcchemann and Weber's slender delta; Nord suggested a [[ramjet]] powered design flying at Mach 3, the other two were jet powered Mach 2 designs that were similar to each other. Of the three, the [[Sud Aviation Super-Caravelle]] won the design contest with a medium-range design deliberately sized to avoid competition with transatlantic US designs they assumed were already on the drawing board.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nAs soon as the design was complete, in April 1960, Pierre Satre, the company's technical director, was sent to Bristol to discuss a partnership. Bristol was surprised to find that the Sud team had designed a very similar aircraft after considering the SST problem and coming to the very same conclusions as the Bristol and STAC teams in terms of economics. It was later revealed that the original STAC report, marked \"For UK Eyes Only\", had secretly been passed to the French to win political favour. Sud made minor changes to the paper, and presented it as their own work.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=49}}\n\nUnsurprisingly, the two teams found much to agree on. The French had no modern large jet engines, and had already concluded they would buy a British design anyway (as they had on the earlier subsonic [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]]).{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=47}} As neither company had experience in the use of high-heat metals for airframes, a maximum speed of around Mach 2 was selected so aluminium could be used&nbsp;\u2013 above this speed the friction with the air warms the metal so much that aluminium begins to soften. This lower speed would also speed development and allow their design to fly before the Americans. Finally, everyone involved agreed that K\u00fcchemann's ogee shaped wing was the right one.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=70}}\n\nThe only disagreements were over the size and range. The UK team was still focused on a 150-passenger design serving transatlantic routes, while the French were deliberately avoiding these. However, this proved not to be the barrier it might seem; common components could be used in both designs, with the shorter range version using a clipped fuselage and four engines, the longer one with a stretched fuselage and six engines, leaving only the wing to be extensively re-designed.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=41}} The teams continued to meet through 1961, and by this time it was clear that the two aircraft would be considerably more similar in spite of different range and seating arrangements. A single design emerged that differed mainly in fuel load. More powerful [[Rolls-Royce Olympus|Bristol Siddeley Olympus]] engines, being developed for the [[TSR-2]], allowed either design to be powered by only four engines.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=50}}\n\n===Cabinet response, treaty===\nWhile the development teams met, French Minister of Public Works and Transport [[Robert Buron]] was meeting with the UK Minister of Aviation [[Peter Thorneycroft]], and Thorneycroft soon revealed to the cabinet that the French were much more serious about a partnership than any of the US companies.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}} The various US companies had proved uninterested in such a venture, likely due to the belief that the government would be funding development and would frown on any partnership with a European company, and the risk of \"giving away\" US technological leadership to a European partner.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=69}}\n\nWhen the STAC plans were presented to the UK cabinet, a very negative reaction resulted. The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be \u00a3150&nbsp;million, which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting that there was no way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that \"the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including the recent history of the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the \u00a3150&nbsp;million [cost] to turn out much too low.\"{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}\n\nThis concern led to an independent review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered for the simple reason that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not be likely to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=71}}\n\nAfter considerable argument, the decision to proceed ultimately fell to an unlikely political expediency. At the time, the UK was pressing for admission to the [[European Common Market]], which was being controlled by [[Charles de Gaulle]] who felt the UK's [[Special Relationship]] with the US made them unacceptable in a pan-European group. Cabinet felt that signing a deal with Sud would pave the way for Common Market entry, and this became the main deciding reason for moving ahead with the deal.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}} It was this belief that had led the original STAC documents being leaked to the French. However, De Gaulle spoke of the European origin of the design, and continued to block the UK's entry into the Common Market.{{sfn|Conway|2005|p=66}}\n\nThe development project was negotiated as an international treaty between the two countries rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included a clause, originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation. A draft treaty was signed on 29 November 1962.<ref name=\"earlyhist\">[http://www.concordesst.com/history/eh1.html#a \"Early History.\"] concordesst.com.

In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and outboard [[elevon]]s, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which are attached to the stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed.{{sfn|Owen|2001|p=78}} Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed.<ref name=\"nova\" /> This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.<ref name=\"popular\">Kocivar, Ben.

This could have been countered by the use of [[Trim tab|trim controls]], but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag.

Due to the significantly less variable nature of high altitude winds compared to those at standard cruising altitudes, these dedicated SST tracks had fixed co-ordinates, unlike the standard routes at lower altitudes, whose co-ordinates are replotted twice daily based on forecast weather patterns ([[jetstream]]s).{{sfn|Orlebar|2004|p=84}} Concorde would also be cleared in a {{convert|15000|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=3}} block, allowing for a slow climb from {{convert|45000|to|60000|ft|m|abbr=on}} during the oceanic crossing as the fuel load gradually decreased.<ref>[[Shanwick Oceanic Control|Prestwick Oceanic Area Control Centre]]: Manual of Air Traffic Services (Part 2).

Combined with the high airspeed at rotation ({{convert|199|knot|disp=or}} [[indicated airspeed]]), this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage in a way that was initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html |title=The real story of Flight 4590: Special Investigation |publisher=iasa.com.au |date=13 May 2001 |first=David |last=Rose |access-date=26 June 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207121508/http://www.iasa.com.au/folders/Safety_Issues/others/concordespacer.html |archive-date=7 February 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Due to the high angle needed at rotation, a small set of wheels was added aft to prevent [[tailstrike]]s.

This fragment punctured a tyre<!-- please leave British spelling of \"tyres\" on British/French aircraft ---> on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a sudden descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the H\u00f4telissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.{{sfn|Endres|2001|pp=110\u2013113}}\n\nThe claim that a metallic strip caused the crash was disputed during the trial both by witnesses (including the pilot of then [[French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]]'s aircraft that had just landed on an adjacent runway when Flight 4590 caught fire) and by an independent French TV investigation that found a wheel spacer had not been installed in the left-side main gear and that the plane caught fire some 1,000 feet from where the metallic strip lay.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spectator.org/print/39656|title=What Price Supersonic Grandeur?|date=28 March 2016|accessdate=21 December 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328150841/http://spectator.org/print/39656|archivedate=28 March 2016}}</ref> British investigators and former French Concorde pilots looked at several other possibilities that the BEA report ignored, including an unbalanced weight distribution in the fuel tanks and loose landing gear.

As the aircraft was climbing and accelerating through Mach 1.7 a \"thud\" was heard. The crew did not notice any handling problems, and they assumed the thud they heard was a minor [[Compressor stall|engine surge]]. No further difficulty was encountered until descent through 40,000 feet at Mach 1.3, when a vibration was felt throughout the aircraft, lasting two to three minutes. Most of the upper rudder had become separated from the aircraft at this point. Aircraft handling was unaffected, and the aircraft made a safe landing at Sydney. The UK's [[Air Accidents Investigation Branch]] (AAIB) concluded that the skin of the rudder had been separating from the rudder structure over a period of time before the accident due to moisture seepage past the [[rivet]]s in the rudder. Furthermore, production staff had not followed proper procedures during an earlier modification of the rudder, but the procedures were difficult to adhere to.<ref name=AAIB89 /> The aircraft was repaired and returned to service.<ref name=AAIB89 />\n* 21 March 1992: A Concorde of British registration, G-BOAB, on a scheduled flight from London to New York, also suffered a structural failure in-flight at supersonic speed. While cruising at Mach 2, at approximately 53,000 feet above mean sea level, the crew heard a \"thump\". No difficulties in handling were noticed, and no instruments gave any irregular indications. This crew also suspected there had been a minor engine surge. One hour later, during descent and while decelerating below Mach 1.4, a sudden \"severe\" vibration began throughout the aircraft.<ref name=AAIB93 /> The vibration worsened when power was added to the No 2 engine, and it was attenuated when that engine's power was reduced. The crew shut down the No 2 engine and made a successful landing in New York, noting only that increased rudder control was needed to keep the aircraft on its intended approach course. Again, the skin had become separated from the structure of the rudder, which led to most of the upper rudder becoming separated in-flight. The AAIB concluded that repair materials had leaked into the structure of the rudder during a recent repair, weakening the bond between the skin and the structure of the rudder, leading to it breaking up in-flight. The large size of the repair had made it difficult to keep repair materials out of the structure, and prior to this accident, the severity of the effect of these repair materials on the structure and skin of the rudder was not appreciated.<ref name=AAIB93 />\n* The 2010 trial involving [[Continental Airlines]] over the crash of Flight 4590 established that from 1976 until Flight 4590 there had been 57 tyre failures involving Concordes during takeoffs, including a near-crash at [[Dulles Airport]] on 14 June 1979 involving Air France Flight 54 where a tyre blowout pierced the plane's fuel tank and damaged the port-side engine and electrical cables, with the loss of two of the craft's hydraulic systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://spectator.org/print/39656|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328150841/http://spectator.org/print/39656|url-status=dead|title=Joseph A.

Despite their constant bumbling, however, they always emerged victorious.\n\nThe show originally aired as a segment on ''[[Yogi's Space Race]]'' from September 9 to October 28, 1978. Following the cancellation of ''Yogi's Space Race'', ''Galaxy Goof-Ups'' was given its own half-hour timeslot on [[NBC]] beginning November 4, 1978. The show has been rebroadcast on [[USA Cartoon Express]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\" characters (Yogi Bear, Scare Bear, Huckleberry Hound and Quack-Up) are all from ''Space Race'', except for the following two new characters who are exclusive to this series:\n\n'''Captain Snerdley''': The Commander of the Galaxy Goof-Ups, Captain Snerdley is forced to put up with their clumsiness since they somehow solve the cases that they are assigned to. In \"The Dopey Defenders\", to make sure the new equipment will work better, he had installed a mechanism which keeps them from touching it.\n\n'''General Bullhorn''': Bullhorn is Snerdley's superior. He is unaware of the Goof-Ups' incompetence and blames Snerdley for whatever goes wrong. In one episode he is seen removing medals (along with pieces of uniform) from Snerdley every time they commit a blunder.\n\n==Voices==\n* [[Daws Butler]] \u2013 Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Son\n* [[Joe Besser]] \u2013 Scare Bear\n* [[Mel Blanc]] \u2013 Quack-Up\n* [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] \u2013 Captain Snerdley, General Blowhard, Papa\n* [[Don Messick]] \u2013 Tacky Cat, Space-Spider\n* [[Ted Cassidy]] \u2013 Drako\n* [[Janet Waldo]] \u2013 Female Yogi look-alike\n\n===Additional voices===\n{{col-begin|width=50%}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Roger Behr]]\n* [[B.J Cling]]\n* [[Henry Corden]]\n* [[Joan Gerber]]\n* [[Marcy Goldman]]\n* [[Bob Hastings]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Jim MacGeorge]]\n* [[Ginny McSwain]]\n* [[Marilyn Schreffler]]\n* [[Alexis Tramunti]]\n* [[Lennie Weinrib]]\n* [[Frank Welker]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:95%; background:#FFFFFF\"\n|- style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#294294; width:20px\"| {{Abbr|N\u00ba|Number}}\n! style=\"background:#294294\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#294294; width:135px\"| Air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = The Purloined Princess\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary = Princess Glama of the planet Camelotta is kidnapped by Zangra and her robot henchman Drako, who use her as bait to trap the Goof-ups; however, the heroes prove to be so incompetent that the villains have to help them get into the trap.

Despite their constant bumbling, however, they always emerged victorious.\n\nThe show originally aired as a segment on ''[[Yogi's Space Race]]'' from September 9 to October 28, 1978. Following the cancellation of ''Yogi's Space Race'', ''Galaxy Goof-Ups'' was given its own half-hour timeslot on [[NBC]] beginning November 4, 1978. The show has been rebroadcast on [[USA Cartoon Express]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]], [[Cartoon Network]] and [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\n==Characters==\nThe \"Galaxy Goof-Ups\" characters (Yogi Bear, Scare Bear, Huckleberry Hound and Quack-Up) are all from ''Space Race'', except for the following two new characters who are exclusive to this series:\n\n'''Captain Snerdley''': The Commander of the Galaxy Goof-Ups, Captain Snerdley is forced to put up with their clumsiness since they somehow solve the cases that they are assigned to. In \"The Dopey Defenders\", to make sure the new equipment will work better, he had installed a mechanism which keeps them from touching it.\n\n'''General Bullhorn''': Bullhorn is Snerdley's superior. He is unaware of the Goof-Ups' incompetence and blames Snerdley for whatever goes wrong. In one episode he is seen removing medals (along with pieces of uniform) from Snerdley every time they commit a blunder.\n\n==Voices==\n* [[Daws Butler]] \u2013 Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, Son\n* [[Joe Besser]] \u2013 Scare Bear\n* [[Mel Blanc]] \u2013 Quack-Up\n* [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]] \u2013 Captain Snerdley, General Blowhard, Papa\n* [[Don Messick]] \u2013 Tacky Cat, Space-Spider\n* [[Ted Cassidy]] \u2013 Drako\n* [[Janet Waldo]] \u2013 Female Yogi look-alike\n\n===Additional voices===\n{{col-begin|width=50%}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Roger Behr]]\n* [[B.J Cling]]\n* [[Henry Corden]]\n* [[Joan Gerber]]\n* [[Marcy Goldman]]\n* [[Bob Hastings]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Jim MacGeorge]]\n* [[Ginny McSwain]]\n* [[Marilyn Schreffler]]\n* [[Alexis Tramunti]]\n* [[Lennie Weinrib]]\n* [[Frank Welker]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{| class=wikitable style=\"width:95%; background:#FFFFFF\"\n|- style=\"color:#FFFFFF\"\n! style=\"background:#294294; width:20px\"| {{Abbr|N\u00ba|Number}}\n! style=\"background:#294294\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#294294; width:135px\"| Air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber = 1\n| Title = The Purloined Princess\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1978|9|9}}\n| ShortSummary = Princess Glama of the planet Camelotta is kidnapped by Zangra and her robot henchman Drako, who use her as bait to trap the Goof-ups; however, the heroes prove to be so incompetent that the villains have to help them get into the trap.

[[Kazakhstan]] is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra. The folk instrument orchestra was named after [[Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly]], a well-known composer and [[dombra]] player from the 19th century.\n\n==Traditional music==\nTraditional music in Kazakhstan often refers to music of the following genres:\n\n* '''Instrumental music''', with the pieces (\"K\u00fcy\") being performed by soloists.

In their excitement, Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her cryokinetic magic. Their parents, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, call for the aid of the colony of hidden folk, led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna and removes her memories of Elsa's magic. Elsa asks for Grand Pabbie to remove her magic, but Grand Pabbie says that it is a part of her, and he gives her a vision of her future, frightening Elsa, who believes that her magic will cause death. The King isolates the sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts out Anna when Anna seeks her out (\"[[Do You Want to Build a Snowman?]]\"). Elsa's fear of her powers grow, and the King and Queen are powerless to help. The parents die at sea during a storm while both princesses are still young.\n\nTen years later, as Elsa turns twenty-one, she is being crowned queen of Arendelle. Anna is excited for the castle's gates to open (\"[[For the First Time in Forever]]\") and meets the handsome Prince Hans (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\"). Elsa is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her, while wishing to be able to reconnect with Anna (\"Dangerous to Dream\"). Elsa's coronation goes smoothly, and she initiates her first contact with Anna in years. They enjoy the coronation together, with Anna talking the Duke of Weselton out of dancing with the newly crowned Queen. However, Elsa leaves Anna after her younger sister asks about keeping the gates open. Anna falls in love with Hans (\"[[Love Is an Open Door]]\"), who quickly proposes marriage to her, and the two share a kiss. The couple asks for Elsa's blessing, who objects because the two have only known each other for a day.  After intense questioning from Anna about shutting her out from her life, Elsa accidentally unleashes her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees the castle to the North Mountain without realizing that her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.\n\nAnna goes in search of Elsa, leaving Hans in charge of the kingdom during her absence. Up in the mountain, ice harvester Kristoff and his reindeer Sven (\"[[Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People]]\") find the ill-equipped Anna, still in her coronation dress. Kristoff gives her a set of winter clothes, and she leaves her dress behind. Kristoff and Anna disagree about love while crossing a bridge (\"What Do You Know About Love\"), with Anna saving Kristoff from falling off the bridge. Anna and Kristoff then encounter a newly created Olaf, who offers to guide them to Elsa, and sings about his love for summer (\"[[In Summer]]\"). A soldier arrives in Arendelle with Anna's dress from the mountain, and Hans fears for Anna's safety. He assembles a search party (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise)), with the Duke sending two of his men with secret orders to kill Elsa. Meanwhile, on the North Mountain, Elsa throws off her cloak, builds an ice castle with her powers, and transforms her coronation dress into a sparkly ice gown (\"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nAnna, Kristoff, and Olaf arrive at Wandering Oaken's Trading Post & Sauna to meet the owner, Oaken (\"Hygge\"). Anna enjoys the sauna together with its many other patrons. Kristoff convinces Oaken and his patrons to aid their journey, which enables them to get provisions, and Anna gets a winter dress.\n\nReaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes angry and frustrated, saying that she cannot fix it, and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart (\"For the First Time in Forever\" (reprise)). Elsa then kicks Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf out while wondering what to do (\"Dangerous to Dream\" (reprise)). Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the hidden folk, his adoptive family, who recognize Anna as the princess and think she's Kristoff's fianc\u00e9e (\"[[Fixer Upper (song)|Fixer Upper]]\"). Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless \"an act of true love\" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss, at the sacrifice of his own hidden love for her (\"Kristoff Lullaby\").\n\nBack in the ice castle, Elsa considers whether she is a monster and wonders how can she end the storm, not sure whether the storm would end or grow worse if she were to die (\"[[Monster (Disney song)|Monster]]\"). She resolves to stay alive to end the storm, but Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, capturing Elsa. Back at the castle, Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, he reveals that he has been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise 2)). Hans locks Anna in a room to die, as Anna reflects on her mistakes while still holding on to the idea of love (\"True Love\"). Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the blizzard outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf reveals is in love with her.\n\nOutside the castle, Hans publicly charges Elsa with treason and sentences her to death. Elsa escapes her chains and flees outside as a blizzard grows (\"Colder by the Minute\"). Kristoff and Anna struggle to find each other. Hans confronts Elsa, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down. Anna finally finds Kristoff but spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa mourns her sister, who thaws out, her sacrifice constituting \"an act of true love\". Realizing that her magic is controlled by love, Elsa ends the winter (\"Vuelie (Love Thaws)\"). Anna punches Hans, and she and Kristoff become a couple. Elsa and Anna reunite without fear for the first time, as the departed King and Queen, young Elsa and young Anna appear in the background, signaling the healing of the sisters' painful past (Finale).\n\n==Musical numbers==\nAll songs by [[Kristen Anderson-Lopez]] and [[Robert Lopez]] unless otherwise noted.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n*\"Vuelie\"\u2020\u2021 \u2013 Company (music and lyrics by [[Christophe Beck]] and [[Frode Fjellheim]]) \n*\"Let the Sun Shine On\" \u2013 Young Anna, Young Elsa, King, Queen and Townspeople\n*\"A Little Bit of You\" \u2013 Young Elsa and Young Anna\n*\"Hidden Folk\" \u2013 Queen, Pabbie, Young Elsa, King and Company\n*\"[[Do You Want to Build a Snowman?]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Young Anna, Anna and Elsa\n*\"[[For the First Time in Forever]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Anna, Elsa and Townspeople\n*\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" \u2013 Hans\n*\"Dangerous to Dream\" \u2013 Elsa and Townspeople\n*\"[[Love Is an Open Door]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Anna and Hans\n*\"[[Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Kristoff\n*\"What Do You Know About Love?\" \u2013 Anna and Kristoff\n*\"[[In Summer]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Olaf\n*\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise) \u2013 Hans, Weselton and Townspeople\n*\"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Elsa\n{{col-2}}\n;Act II\n*\"Hygge\" \u2013 Oaken, Kristoff, Anna, Olaf, Family and Friends\n*\"For the First Time in Forever\" (reprise)\u2020 \u2013 Anna and Elsa\n*\"I Can't Lose You \u2013 Anna and Elsa (song added February 2020)\n*\"Dangerous to Dream\" (reprise) \u2013 Elsa\n*\"[[Fixer Upper (song)|Fixer Upper]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Bulda, Pabbie, Olaf and Hidden Folk\n*\"Kristoff Lullaby\" \u2013 Kristoff\n*\"[[Monster (Disney song)|Monster]]\" \u2013 Elsa, Hans and Men\n*\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise 2) \u2013 Hans and Anna\n*\"True Love\" \u2013 Anna\n*\"Colder by the Minute\" \u2013 Anna, Kristoff, Elsa, Hans and Townspeople\n*\"Finale\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n\u2020 Featured in the [[Frozen (2013 film)|2013 film]].\n\u2021 \"Vuelie\" written by [[Frode Fjellheim]] and [[Christophe Beck]]\n\n==Characters and original cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%;\"\n|-\n! \"width=15%;\" | Character\n! \"width:30%;\" | Original Broadway cast<br/><small>(2018)</small>\n! \"width:30%;\" | US tour cast<br/><small>(2019)</small><ref>[https://tourstoyou.org/2019/09/23/casting-news-frozen-announces-full-touring-cast \"Casting News: ''Frozen'' Announces Full Touring Cast\"], ToursToYou.org, September 23, 2019</ref>\n|-\n!

In their excitement, Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her cryokinetic magic. Their parents, King Agnarr and Queen Iduna, call for the aid of the colony of hidden folk, led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna and removes her memories of Elsa's magic. Elsa asks for Grand Pabbie to remove her magic, but Grand Pabbie says that it is a part of her, and he gives her a vision of her future, frightening Elsa, who believes that her magic will cause death. The King isolates the sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts out Anna when Anna seeks her out (\"[[Do You Want to Build a Snowman?]]\"). Elsa's fear of her powers grow, and the King and Queen are powerless to help. The parents die at sea during a storm while both princesses are still young.\n\nTen years later, as Elsa turns twenty-one, she is being crowned queen of Arendelle. Anna is excited for the castle's gates to open (\"[[For the First Time in Forever]]\") and meets the handsome Prince Hans (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\"). Elsa is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her, while wishing to be able to reconnect with Anna (\"Dangerous to Dream\"). Elsa's coronation goes smoothly, and she initiates her first contact with Anna in years. They enjoy the coronation together, with Anna talking the Duke of Weselton out of dancing with the newly crowned Queen. However, Elsa leaves Anna after her younger sister asks about keeping the gates open. Anna falls in love with Hans (\"[[Love Is an Open Door]]\"), who quickly proposes marriage to her, and the two share a kiss. The couple asks for Elsa's blessing, who objects because the two have only known each other for a day.  After intense questioning from Anna about shutting her out from her life, Elsa accidentally unleashes her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees the castle to the North Mountain without realizing that her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.\n\nAnna goes in search of Elsa, leaving Hans in charge of the kingdom during her absence. Up in the mountain, ice harvester Kristoff and his reindeer Sven (\"[[Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People]]\") find the ill-equipped Anna, still in her coronation dress. Kristoff gives her a set of winter clothes, and she leaves her dress behind. Kristoff and Anna disagree about love while crossing a bridge (\"What Do You Know About Love\"), with Anna saving Kristoff from falling off the bridge. Anna and Kristoff then encounter a newly created Olaf, who offers to guide them to Elsa, and sings about his love for summer (\"[[In Summer]]\"). A soldier arrives in Arendelle with Anna's dress from the mountain, and Hans fears for Anna's safety. He assembles a search party (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise)), with the Duke sending two of his men with secret orders to kill Elsa. Meanwhile, on the North Mountain, Elsa throws off her cloak, builds an ice castle with her powers, and transforms her coronation dress into a sparkly ice gown (\"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nAnna, Kristoff, and Olaf arrive at Wandering Oaken's Trading Post & Sauna to meet the owner, Oaken (\"Hygge\"). Anna enjoys the sauna together with its many other patrons. Kristoff convinces Oaken and his patrons to aid their journey, which enables them to get provisions, and Anna gets a winter dress.\n\nReaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes angry and frustrated, saying that she cannot fix it, and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart (\"For the First Time in Forever\" (reprise)). Elsa then kicks Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf out while wondering what to do (\"Dangerous to Dream\" (reprise)). Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the hidden folk, his adoptive family, who recognize Anna as the princess and think she's Kristoff's fianc\u00e9e (\"[[Fixer Upper (song)|Fixer Upper]]\"). Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless \"an act of true love\" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss, at the sacrifice of his own hidden love for her (\"Kristoff Lullaby\").\n\nBack in the ice castle, Elsa considers whether she is a monster and wonders how can she end the storm, not sure whether the storm would end or grow worse if she were to die (\"[[Monster (Disney song)|Monster]]\"). She resolves to stay alive to end the storm, but Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, capturing Elsa. Back at the castle, Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, he reveals that he has been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters (\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise 2)). Hans locks Anna in a room to die, as Anna reflects on her mistakes while still holding on to the idea of love (\"True Love\"). Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the blizzard outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf reveals is in love with her.\n\nOutside the castle, Hans publicly charges Elsa with treason and sentences her to death. Elsa escapes her chains and flees outside as a blizzard grows (\"Colder by the Minute\"). Kristoff and Anna struggle to find each other. Hans confronts Elsa, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down. Anna finally finds Kristoff but spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa mourns her sister, who thaws out, her sacrifice constituting \"an act of true love\". Realizing that her magic is controlled by love, Elsa ends the winter (\"Vuelie (Love Thaws)\"). Anna punches Hans, and she and Kristoff become a couple. Elsa and Anna reunite without fear for the first time, as the departed King and Queen, young Elsa and young Anna appear in the background, signaling the healing of the sisters' painful past (Finale).\n\n==Musical numbers==\nAll songs by [[Kristen Anderson-Lopez]] and [[Robert Lopez]] unless otherwise noted.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n*\"Vuelie\"\u2020\u2021 \u2013 Company (music and lyrics by [[Christophe Beck]] and [[Frode Fjellheim]]) \n*\"Let the Sun Shine On\" \u2013 Young Anna, Young Elsa, King, Queen and Townspeople\n*\"A Little Bit of You\" \u2013 Young Elsa and Young Anna\n*\"Hidden Folk\" \u2013 Queen, Pabbie, Young Elsa, King and Company\n*\"[[Do You Want to Build a Snowman?]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Young Anna, Anna and Elsa\n*\"[[For the First Time in Forever]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Anna, Elsa and Townspeople\n*\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" \u2013 Hans\n*\"Dangerous to Dream\" \u2013 Elsa and Townspeople\n*\"[[Love Is an Open Door]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Anna and Hans\n*\"[[Reindeer(s) Are Better Than People]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Kristoff\n*\"What Do You Know About Love?\" \u2013 Anna and Kristoff\n*\"[[In Summer]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Olaf\n*\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise) \u2013 Hans, Weselton and Townspeople\n*\"[[Let It Go (Disney song)|Let It Go]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Elsa\n{{col-2}}\n;Act II\n*\"Hygge\" \u2013 Oaken, Kristoff, Anna, Olaf, Family and Friends\n*\"For the First Time in Forever\" (reprise)\u2020 \u2013 Anna and Elsa\n*\"I Can't Lose You \u2013 Anna and Elsa (song added February 2020)\n*\"Dangerous to Dream\" (reprise) \u2013 Elsa\n*\"[[Fixer Upper (song)|Fixer Upper]]\"\u2020 \u2013 Bulda, Pabbie, Olaf and Hidden Folk\n*\"Kristoff Lullaby\" \u2013 Kristoff\n*\"[[Monster (Disney song)|Monster]]\" \u2013 Elsa, Hans and Men\n*\"Hans of the Southern Isles\" (reprise 2) \u2013 Hans and Anna\n*\"True Love\" \u2013 Anna\n*\"Colder by the Minute\" \u2013 Anna, Kristoff, Elsa, Hans and Townspeople\n*\"Finale\" \u2013 Company\n{{col-end}}\n\n\u2020 Featured in the [[Frozen (2013 film)|2013 film]].\n\u2021 \"Vuelie\" written by [[Frode Fjellheim]] and [[Christophe Beck]]\n\n==Characters and original cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:70%;\"\n|-\n! \"width=15%;\" | Character\n! \"width:30%;\" | Original Broadway cast<br/><small>(2018)</small>\n! \"width:30%;\" | US tour cast<br/><small>(2019)</small><ref>[https://tourstoyou.org/2019/09/23/casting-news-frozen-announces-full-touring-cast \"Casting News: ''Frozen'' Announces Full Touring Cast\"], ToursToYou.org, September 23, 2019</ref>\n|-\n!
