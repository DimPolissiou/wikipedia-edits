It originally aired on [[NBC]] in the United States on September 17, 2009. The episode was written and directed by [[Paul Lieberstein]]. It features [[Max Carver]], Kelii Miyata and Elvy Yost in guest appearances as [[Dunder Mifflin]]'s summer interns.\n\nThe series\u2014[[mockumentary|presented as if it were a real documentary]]\u2014depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], branch of the fictional [[Dunder Mifflin]] Paper Company. In the episode, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]] spreads a rumor about [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] having an affair, then spreads a series of false rumors to try to convince everyone the original rumor was not true. The rumors cause Andy to question his sexuality, and Pam and Jim to debate whether or not to tell the office that Pam is pregnant.\n\n\"Gossip\" confirmed the fact that protagonist [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] was pregnant, which was strongly hinted in the [[The Office (U.S. season 5)|fifth season]] finale, \"[[Company Picnic]]\". \"Gossip\" was the first episode to feature [[Ellie Kemper]] as a regular cast member, and the first ''Office'' episode since [[Ed Helms]] achieved box office success with the summer comedy film, ''[[The Hangover]]''. \"Gossip\" received generally positive reviews, with several commentators particularly praising the subplot in which [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] questions whether the rumor about him being gay might actually be true. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], the episode was watched by 8.21 million viewers. Although ''The Office'' had the highest 9 p.m. rating among viewers aged between 18 and 49, the overall episode constituted an 18 percent drop in viewership compared to the fifth-season premiere, \"[[Weight Loss (The Office)|Weight Loss]]\". \"Gossip\" was nominated for a [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for best episodic comedy.\n\n==Synopsis==\nAs the three summer [[intern]]s prepare to depart, [[Michael Scott (The Office)|Michael]] ([[Steve Carell]]) hears from various members of the office that two of the interns might be dating, and feels upset that he was left out of the gossip. He talks about the situation with the third intern, and learns that the interns had recently gone out to a young people's club, where they saw [[Stanley Hudson|Stanley]] ([[Leslie David Baker]]) dancing with a woman, presumably his wife Teri. Michael, wanting to start some gossip of his own, forms the conclusion that Stanley was out because he was having a mid-life crisis and shares it with the office, but [[Phyllis Vance|Phyllis]] ([[Phyllis Smith]]) claims Stanley does not like crowds and that Teri is out of town. When Michael confronts the interns about this, they insist they saw Stanley there \"[[making out]]\" with a woman. Now realizing that Stanley is possibly having an affair and he is the first person to learn of it, Michael starts telling the employees. [[Jim Halpert|Jim]] ([[John Krasinski]]) urges Michael to stop spreading a rumor that he does not know for certain to be true. When Stanley is leaving, Michael heads to the parking lot to discuss the rumor with him. Stanley initially denies it, but when Michael mentions that he was spotted in the club by the interns, he reveals that since Teri has been out of town constantly, he has been seeking company from a nurse named Cynthia, whom he met in rehab. Stanley urges Michael not to say anything since he is breaking it off with Cynthia, and Michael agrees, despite having already told the entire office.\n\nHoping to obscure the truth about Stanley's affair, Michael starts spreading a variety of false rumors, among them that there is another person physically inside [[Kevin Malone|Kevin]] ([[Brian Baumgartner]]), that [[Kelly Kapoor|Kelly]] ([[Mindy Kaling]]) is [[anorexia|anorexic]], that [[Creed Bratton (character)|Creed]] ([[Creed Bratton]]) has [[asthma]], that [[Toby Flenderson|Toby]] ([[Paul Lieberstein]]) is still a virgin (despite him having a daughter), that [[Pam Beesly|Pam]] ([[Jenna Fischer]]) is [[pregnancy|pregnant]], and that [[Andy Bernard|Andy]] ([[Ed Helms]]) is gay. When Andy hears about this, he realizes that many people have thought this about him in the past and gets increasingly insecure as he begins to question his sexual orientation. Jim and Pam, who were trying to keep Pam's pregnancy a secret, think they have been found out. The couple then notice that there have been various absurd rumors about office employees being spread. When Jim brings it to everyone's attention, they trace one particular rumor back to Michael, who then tries to slip out of the office.\n\nThe employees pursue Michael, and he confesses that he created the rumors to conceal the one true rumor. Andy fears that it might be the one about him. The employees urge Michael to tell them which one is true, but just as Michael is about to give in, Jim announces that Pam is actually pregnant to save Stanley. Michael denies it, but Pam shows her baby's [[ultrasound]] picture to prove it. Later, while Michael discusses her pregnancy with Jim and Pam in his office, Stanley's wife Teri returns Michael's call from earlier. He picks up the phone with the intention of making an excuse for his earlier call so as to not tip her off, but he accidentally calls her Cynthia twice before Jim hangs up the phone for him. Teri had already been suspicious of Stanley and Cynthia, so Michael calling her Cynthia is enough for her to figure out what is going on. Michael, feeling guilty, watches from his office window as Stanley attacks Michael's car with a [[tire iron]] in a fit of rage. At the end of the episode, the three interns discuss what they have learned at Dunder Mifflin, which they reveal was essentially nothing.\n\ngg wwsgtfrbyh4w5n #aqmet ghfw4,h\n\n==Cultural references==\nDuring the episode's [[cold open]], Michael, Dwight and Andy run throughout the office climbing on desks, jumping off chairs and pushing themselves off objects.

It was a version of the [[Fiat 600]] made under licence from 1962<ref>A. J. Jacobs, Automotive FDI in Emerging Europe, page 297</ref>  and was longer in length than the Fiat version. The Zastava 750 has a {{convert|767|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} engine, which produces {{convert|25|PS|kW|1|abbr=on}}.

Later on during production, in 1980, the '''Zastava 850''' was introduced. It is nearly identical to the Zastava 750 but the engine had a larger capacity. The Zastava 850 is harder to find than the 750 model but both are still widely available in former Yugoslavia.\n\nThe Zastava 750 is widely known by its nickname \"Fi\u0107a\" (\u0424\u0438\u045ba) in Serbian, \"Fi\u0107o\" in Croatian, by \"Fi\u010do\" or \"Fi\u010dko\" in Slovene and by \"Fikjo\" (\u0424\u0438\u045c\u043e) in Macedonian. The nickname \"Fi\u0107a\" comes from the main character of a comic published by the newspaper [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]] during the first years of the car's production.\n\n==Development==\n\nThe Yugoslavian-built '''Zastava 600''' was an under Fiat license produced version of the Fiat 600.<ref name=yugoslavian>[http://yugoslavian.blogspot.com.au/2009/04/first-passenger-car-zastava-750-fica.html First passenger car - Zastava 750 \"Fi\u0107a\", yugoslavian.blogspot.com.au], Retrieved 11 January 2018</ref> Production commenced in 1955, and the model was upgraded with a larger engine in september of 1960.<ref name=yugoslavian/> It received a Zastava 750 badge in 1962. The 750 retained frontal [[suicide doors]] (rear-hinged) until 1969. Later it got bigger front lights, autoadjusting brakes, seatbelts, slightly improved interior and many other small improvements. The later Zastava 850 had many improvements from the original model, but it retained the same 600 body style. The 750 used a 25&nbsp;hp (30&nbsp;hp in the 750 SE) 767&nbsp;cc engine, while the 850 received an 848&nbsp;cc version providing 32&nbsp;hp and a useful dollop of extra torque.\n\nProduction of the Zastava 750 began on 18 October 1955 and ended on 18 November 1985. The car's popularity has started increasing in the last years, partly from the low fuel consumption and very cheap price as a second hand vehicle.

It was a version of the [[Fiat 600]] made under licence from 1962<ref>A. J. Jacobs, Automotive FDI in Emerging Europe, page 297</ref>  and was longer in length than the Fiat version. The Zastava 750 has a {{convert|767|cc|cuin|1|abbr=on}} engine, which produces {{convert|25|PS|kW|1|abbr=on}}. The more powerful 750 SE has {{convert|30|PS|kW|1|abbr=on}} at 5400&nbsp;rpm and torque is {{convert|38|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 3600&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"FindTheData\" /> It is the smallest car ever made by Zastava. Later on during production, in 1980, the '''Zastava 850''' was introduced. It is nearly identical to the Zastava 750 but the engine had a larger capacity. The Zastava 850 is harder to find than the 750 model but both are still widely available in former Yugoslavia.\n\nZastava 750 is widely known by its nickname \"Fi\u0107a\" (\u0424\u0438\u045ba) in Serbian, \"Fi\u0107o\" in Croatian, by \"Fi\u010do\" or \"Fi\u010dko\" in Slovene and by \"Fikjo\" (\u0424\u0438\u045c\u043e) in Macedonian. The nickname \"Fi\u0107a\" comes from the main character of a comic published by the newspaper [[Borba (newspaper)|Borba]] during the first years of the car's production.\n\n==Development==\n\nThe Yugoslavian-built '''Zastava 600''' was an under Fiat license produced version of the Fiat 600.<ref name=yugoslavian>[http://yugoslavian.blogspot.com.au/2009/04/first-passenger-car-zastava-750-fica.html First passenger car - Zastava 750 \"Fi\u0107a\", yugoslavian.blogspot.com.au], Retrieved 11 January 2018</ref> Production commenced in 1955, and the model was upgraded with a larger engine in september of 1960.<ref name=yugoslavian/> It received a Zastava 750 badge in 1962. The 750 retained frontal [[suicide doors]] (rear-hinged) until 1969. Later it got bigger front lights, autoadjusting brakes, seatbelts, slightly improved interior and many other small improvements. The later Zastava 850 had many improvements from the original model, but it retained the same 600 body style. The 750 used a 25&nbsp;hp (30&nbsp;hp in the 750 SE) 767&nbsp;cc engine, while the 850 received an 848&nbsp;cc version providing 32&nbsp;hp and a useful dollop of extra torque.\n\nProduction of the Zastava 750 began on 18 October 1955 and ended on 18 November 1985. The car's popularity has started increasing in the last years, partly from the low fuel consumption and very cheap price as a second hand vehicle. Also it starting to become a symbol for nostalgia, and many youngsters that need cheap utilitarian vehicle with a bohemian status symbol are buying this car as a second hand vehicle. Because of that prices have risen in the last couple of years and many fan clubs have emerged.\n\n==Colombian assembly==\n\nThe Zastava 750 was also assembled in [[Colombia]] - next to a variety of American Jeeps as well as other Fiat models - by [[Compa\u00f1\u00eda Colombiana Automotriz|Leonidas Lara (C.C.A.)]] in Bogot\u00e1.<ref>{{citation | title = An\u00e1lisis estrat\u00e9gico del sector automotriz en Colombia | trans-title = A strategic analysis of Colombia's automotive sector | language = Spanish | publisher = Universidad del Rosario | location = Bogot\u00e1, Colombia | url = http://repository.urosario.edu.co/bitstream/10336/3955/3/1020727693-2012.pdf | page = 10 | first1 = Laura Cristina | last1 = Munar Guerrero | first2 = Johana Patricia | last2 = Quiroga Porras | first3 = Manuel Fernando | last3 = Pe\u00f1a Mayorga | date = 2012-10-09 }}</ref> It was sold in Colombia as the \"Fiat 750Z\", from 1977 until 1984.

According to Russell, it would be a \"enormous sealed environment, capable of identifying current research into the processes of our ecosystem\". As lead of the Russell Group, he soon announced that he aimed to use the facility to develop a new type of vegetation called Bio-Engineered Synthetic Hybrids (Synths) that would combat the rising levels of CO2. Russell's outlandish statements were ridiculed by the press, and to the world the plans were shelved when in 1992 Russell pulled the plug and abruptly resigned in order to avoid his public commitments and instead work on \"the one key issue we now face\". The Russell Group was in the process of pushing Sanctuary Initiative legislation to save the oceans, but to the world at large, it seemed that without their leader the group lost influence and momentum. By abandoning and sabotaging the project, Russell caused a scandal. In actuality, Russell had retreated to Mt Chimborazo and began to commence work on the biodomes, and lobbied the government to aid this project.\n\nIn 1995, it was reported that top secret construction work was happening around the biosphere location, protected by local government forces, and by August 1996 the three primary biodomes were sealed. Russell's attention turned to his project Biosphere 4 - an accelerated evolution biodome to house the Synths - and despite his reservations decided to sell to Subtech to ensure its completion. It was officially announced that Sam Devlin would become the sole funder of the Biosphere 4 research facility when his company Subtech, a subsidiary of Subsea Technologies Corporation, bought out the project. Devlin and Russell had previously been Subtech's employees in the 1970s, but when it was revealed their project to allow people to live at ocean depths for months was to allow the mining of Earth's seabeds, Russell left while Devlin stayed. By buying him out, Devlin now compromised Russell and effectively removed the last obstacle in their way.  The Biosphere 4 'popped' to become a sealed environment in 2000, and Russell began the second phase of his project, to create Synths. This became his singular project, to the point where he almost eradicated the rainforest biodome due to a fungal outbreak. In 2003, Russell shared his research regarding the Synth4 plants to his colleague Sarah Parish, and asked for her help with the research. However, in 2005 he became too accustomed to the quick feedback loop of the biodome, and let the latest variant - Synth8 - be planted into the Biodome despite warnings from Sarah regarding their instability. After discovering that the Synths began attacking their babies within the growth chamber, Russell feared that he should have heeded Sarah's warnings though noted that oxygen could defeat the strongest of Synths. He pumps oxygen in killing his creations, and he fears what he has unleashed.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 10th anniversary of the Biosphere 4, Russell sent Devlin his proposed speech which pushed environmental issues. This angered Devlin who noted that he owned the project and Russell, and that it was seen as his baby at Subtech, so he would reassert his power if need be. In 2006 Devlin emailed Russell about that workers were arriving to construct a leisure resort complex in the advanced evolution biodome called Club Eden, which Russell was not happy about due to putting an end to his Synth experiments. When Devlin sent Russell a blackmailing video detailing how Russell had orchestrated an assassination of a colleague, Russell noted that Biosphere 4 was his home and that he would do anything in his power to protect it. The act of welding is turning oxygen into CO2 and the workers began to notice a change in the ecosystem, causing the air to become unfit to breathe and making workers suffer from respiratory issues and exhaustion. The workers began hearing and seeing weird things (the Synths), and Russell begins making trips to the biodome spraying fire extinguishers to lure out the Synths. Devlin instigates a policy where if the project wasn't completed, the workers would be sealed into the dome. Devlin also disconnects power from the biodome to the main control centre so Russell can't interfere. On December 10, 1997, the biodome wired up to the terminal so they could regulate their own atmosphere, taking the power away from Russell. Soon enough, a worker is killed by a Synth. On December 12, 2007, Devlin removed the ladder leaving to the cave out of the Biodome, effectively trapping the workers. On December 16, 2007, Russel issues his last warning and on December 20, Devlin tells the workers that everything's going to be okay. On December 23, 2007 two more workers disappear. Each of these deaths causes CO2 to be turned into oxygen. On December 24 during a Christmas party, Russell leaves a frantic message to the workers about the Synths, before a fire breaks loose which decimates the biodome. It is implied that Russel did this in an attempt to flush the biome clean by pumping oxygen in to kill all the Synths, as relayed in an audio recording. There aren't enough extinguishers to put out the fire. Russell shows up to help and the leader of the workers, who had previously been skeptical of Russell, attempts to follow him to safety but he and the rest die (accelerated by the alcohol). Russell barely escapes and passes out once he returns to the rainforest biodome, suffering from amnesia, which is where the game starts, on December 25, 2007.\n\nDevlin sends Russell a video message saying that he knows Russell is responsible for the fire, and that he is furious and will destroy his life.\n\nUpon the player nearing completion of restoring the atmosphere of Biosphere 4, Devlin sends Russell a final message detailing that thanks to Russel's efforts, Club Eden is ready for its first consignment of tourists, and that Subtech will kill Russel and posthumously ruin his reputation as the murderer of the Subtech worker crew and for being complicit in the assassination of his partner. Russell successfully escapes by un'popping' Biosphere 4, though the experiment proves that colonies can be created on other planets like Mars. While police wish to speak to him regarding the fire and assassination, Russell disappears without a trace. Meanwhile, Club Eden opened as planned and patrons noticed their partners going missing, which Devlin put down to administration error. Devlin is later killed by a Synth, and the Synth spores spread out into the human world.\n\n=== The game's perspective ===\nThe game follows the [[protagonist]] Professor Alan Russell and is set inside the [[fictional]] ecological facility Biosphere Four which was built by the Subtech Corporation,. Russell awakes in what first appears to be a [[rainforest]] but is actually one of four artificial [[biomes]].<ref name=\"Biosys for Windows - MobyGames\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/biosys|title=Biosys for Windows (1999) - MobyGames|website=MobyGames}}</ref> The player initially has to maintain Russel's [[wiktionary:survival|survival]] inside this environment and begin to unravel the mysteries behind this facility and the character's current predicament (Russell is suffering from [[amnesia]]). The ultimate goal of this real-time adventure is for the player to restore the natural balance in four artificial biotopes and escape.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/PC-Player-German-Magazine-1998-11|title=PC Player German Magazine 1998-11|last=PC Player|date=November 1998|language=German}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Biosys 1999 gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|right|The player navigates a jungle with the help of the compass tool.]]\nThe game is a combination of mystery, [[puzzle]], survival, and simulation genres.<ref name=\"Biosys for Windows - MobyGames\"/> Much of the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and necessary actions revolve around manipulating the biomes' ecological conditions via control panels (e.g. {{CO2}}, rainfall, temperature) with noticeable and profound effect on the conditions of the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] contained within. The four different biomes are '[[rainforest]]', '[[savanna]]', '[[ocean]]', and 'accelerated [[evolution]]', connected by a train and an underground network.\n\nPressing Tab will show the health/energy status of the player, which show if the player is hungry, thirsty, tired, hot, sick, or has other physical conditions. This information is used when players plan trips through the complex - longer trips use up more resources. The game consists of 360\u00b0 rotational screens, and predefined pathways for the player to follow. The game is presented from the subjective first-person point of view. The biospheres live and breath in real-time - for instance plants grow as day and night passes. Decisions made in the game can have effects on both that enclosure and the other biodomes, and poor decisions can cause plant and animal life to die.<ref name=\":3\"/>\n\nEach location features hotspots that activate via a context-sensitive cursor, including switches, items, or paths to a different area. Tasks include fixing the dome's malfunctioning heating, ventilation and drainage systems, while passwords can be discovered by accessing different parts of the complex.\n\n== Development ==\nAaron Witkin, the game's executive producer, had preceded this title with the 1994 CD-ROM [[The Dead Sea Scrolls Revealed]], along with Pixel Multimedia and under license from the Israel Antiquities Authority.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imjl.com/catalog/dssr/dssr.html|title=The Dead Sea Scrolls Revealed|date=2019|website=Infomedia Judaica|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref> This game bears a similarity to the \"scientific experiment Biosph\u00e8re 2 that had plunged a few men and women into a giant sphere to determine if they could preserve the ecosystem and live in total self-sufficiency\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Riquier|first=Nicolas|date=February 1999|title=Virtual Biosphere|url=https://www.amigaland.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1721:generation-4-119-1999-02&catid=36&Itemid=122|journal=Generation 4|language=fr|volume=|issue=119|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>https://www.abandonware-magazines.org/affiche_mag.php?mag=27&num=510&album=oui</ref>\n[[File:Biosphere 2 Habitat & Lung 2009-05-10.jpg|thumb|left|Commentators noted ''Biosys''{{'}}s similarity to the real-world [[Biosphere 2]] experiment.]]\nThe game was announced in ''[[PC Games (magazine)|PC Games]]'' issue 74, which noted that Take 2 was working on a render adventure in the style of ''Myst'', which would include puzzles while also conveying biological connections.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=November 1998|title=Telegramm|url=https://archive.org/details/PC.Games.N074.1998.11-fl0n/page/n13|journal=PC Games|language=De|volume=|issue=74|pages=14|via=}}</ref> Originally meant to be released in October 1998,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 1998|title=Flugsimulationen|url=https://archive.org/details/pcaction_magazine-1998-07/page/n43|journal=PC Action|language=De|volume=|pages=45|issn=0946-6290|via=}}</ref> then November 13, 1998,<ref name=\":2\"/> but it was eventually delayed for the following year.

According to Russell, it would be a \"enormous sealed environment, capable of identifying current research into the processes of our ecosystem\". As lead of the Russell Group, he soon announced that he aimed to use the facility to develop a new type of vegetation called Bio-Engineered Synthetic Hybrids (Synths) that would combat the rising levels of CO2. Russell's outlandish statements were ridiculed by the press, and to the world the plans were shelved when in 1992 Russell pulled the plug and abruptly resigned in order to avoid his public commitments and instead work on \"the one key issue we now face\". The Russell Group was in the process of pushing Sanctuary Initiative legislation to save the oceans, but to the world at large, it seemed that without their leader the group lost influence and momentum. By abandoning and sabotaging the project, Russell caused a scandal. In actuality, Russell had retreated to Mt Chimborazo and began to commence work on the biodomes, and lobbied the government to aid this project.\n\nIn 1995, it was reported that top secret construction work was happening around the biosphere location, protected by local government forces, and by August 1996 the three primary biodomes were sealed. Russell's attention turned to his project Biosphere 4 - an accelerated evolution biodome to house the Synths - and despite his reservations decided to sell to Subtech to ensure its completion. It was officially announced that Sam Devlin would became the sole funder of the Biosphere 4 research facility when his company Subtech, a subsidiary of Subsea Technologies Corporation, bought out the project. Devlin and Russell had previously been Subtech's employees in the 1970s, but when it was revealed their project to allow people to live at ocean depths for months was to allow the mining of Earth's seabeds, Russell left while Devlin stayed. By buying him out, Devlin now compromised Russell and effectively removed the last obstacle in their way.  The Biosphere 4 'popped' to become a sealed environment in 2000, and Russell began the second phase of his project, to create Synths. This became his singular project, to the point where he almost eradicated the rainforest biodome due to a fungal outbreak. In 2003, Russell shared his research regarding the Synth4 plants to his colleague Sarah Parish, and asked for her help with the research. However, in 2005 he became too accustomed to the quick feedback loop of the biodome, and let the latest variant - Synth8 - be planted into the Biodome despite warnings from Sarah regarding their instability. After discovering that the Synths began attacking their babies within the growth chamber, Russell feared that he should have heeded Sarah's warnings though noted that oxygen could defeat the strongest of Synths. He pumps oxygen in killing his creations, and he fears what he has unleashed.\n\nIn the lead-up to the 10th anniversary of the Biosphere 4, Russell sent Devlin his proposed speech which pushed environmental issues. This angered Devlin who noted that he owned the project and Russell, and that it was seen as his baby at Subtech, so he would reassert his power if need be. In 2006 Devlin emailed Russell about that workers were arriving to construct a leisure resort complex in the advanced evolution biodome called Club Eden, which Russell was not happy about due to putting an end to his Synth experiments. When Devlin sent Russell a blackmailing video detailing how Russell had orchestrated an assassination of a colleague, Russell noted that Biosphere 4 was his home and that he would do anything in his power to protect it. The act of welding is turning oxygen into CO2 and the workers began to notice a change in the ecosystem, causing the air to become unfit to breathe and making workers suffer from respiratory issues and exhaustion. The workers began hearing and seeing weird things (the Synths), and Russell begins making trips to the biodome spraying fire extinguishers to lure out the Synths. Devlin instigates a policy where if the project wasn't completed, the workers would be sealed into the dome. Devlin also disconnects power from the biodome to the main control centre so Russell can't interfere. On December 10, 1997, the biodome wired up to the terminal so they could regulate their own atmosphere, taking the power away from Russell. Soon enough, a worker is killed by a Synth. On December 12, 2007, Devlin removed the ladder leaving to the cave out of the Biodome, effectively trapping the workers. On December 16, 2007, Russel issues his last warning and on December 20, Devlin tells the workers that everything's going to be okay. On December 23, 2007 two more workers disappear. Each of these deaths causes CO2 to be turned into oxygen. On December 24 during a Christmas party, Russell leaves a frantic message to the workers about the Synths, before a fire breaks loose which decimates the biodome. It is implied that Russel did this in an attempt to flush the biome clean by pumping oxygen in to kill all the Synths, as relayed in an audio recording. There aren't enough extinguishers to put out the fire. Russell shows up to help and the leader of the workers, who had previously been skeptical of Russell, attempts to follow him to safety but he and the rest die (accelerated by the alcohol). Russell barely escapes and passes out once he returns to the rainforest biodome, suffering from amnesia, which is where the game starts, on December 25, 2007.\n\nDevlin sends Russell a video message saying that he knows Russell is responsible for the fire, and that he is furious and will destroy his life.\n\nUpon the player nearing completion of restoring the atmosphere of Biosphere 4, Devlin sends Russell a final message detailing that thanks to Russel's efforts, Club Eden is ready for its first consignment of tourists, and that Subtech will kill Russel and posthumously ruin his reputation as the murderer of the Subtech worker crew and for being complicit in the assassination of his partner. Russell successfully escapes by un'popping' Biosphere 4, though the experiment proves that colonies can be created on other planets like Mars. While police wish to speak to him regarding the fire and assassination, Russell disappears without a trace. Meanwhile, Club Eden opened as planned and patrons noticed their partners going missing, which Devlin put down to administration error. Devlin is later killed by a Synth, and the Synth spores spread out into the human world.\n\n=== The game's perspective ===\nThe game follows the [[protagonist]] Professor Alan Russell and is set inside the [[fictional]] ecological facility Biosphere Four which was built by the Subtech Corporation,. Russell awakes in what first appears to be a [[rainforest]] but is actually one of four artificial [[biomes]].<ref name=\"Biosys for Windows - MobyGames\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/biosys|title=Biosys for Windows (1999) - MobyGames|website=MobyGames}}</ref> The player initially has to maintain Russel's [[wiktionary:survival|survival]] inside this environment and begin to unravel the mysteries behind this facility and the character's current predicament (Russell is suffering from [[amnesia]]). The ultimate goal of this real-time adventure is for the player to restore the natural balance in four artificial biotopes and escape.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/PC-Player-German-Magazine-1998-11|title=PC Player German Magazine 1998-11|last=PC Player|date=November 1998|language=German}}</ref>\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Biosys 1999 gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|right|The player navigates a jungle with the help of the compass tool.]]\nThe game is a combination of mystery, [[puzzle]], survival, and simulation genres.<ref name=\"Biosys for Windows - MobyGames\"/> Much of the [[plot (narrative)|plot]] and necessary actions revolve around manipulating the biomes' ecological conditions via control panels (e.g. {{CO2}}, rainfall, temperature) with noticeable and profound effect on the conditions of the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] contained within. The four different biomes are '[[rainforest]]', '[[savanna]]', '[[ocean]]', and 'accelerated [[evolution]]', connected by a train and an underground network.\n\nPressing Tab will show the health/energy status of the player, which show if the player is hungry, thirsty, tired, hot, sick, or has other physical conditions. This information is used when players plan trips through the complex - longer trips use up more resources. The game consists of 360\u00b0 rotational screens, and predefined pathways for the player to follow. The game is presented from the subjective first-person point of view. The biospheres live and breath in real-time - for instance plants grow as day and night passes.

Zhang Liang contributed greatly to the establishment of the Han dynasty. After his death, he was honoured with the [[Posthumous name|posthumous title]] \"Marquis Wencheng\" by [[Emperor Qianshao of Han|Emperor Qianshao]].\n\n==Early life==\nZhang Liang was born in Xinzheng{{original research inline|date=November 2016}} (\u65b0\u912d; present-day [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]]), the capital of the [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n state]](\u97d3\u570b), while his [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]] was in Chengfu (\u57ce\u7236; present-day Chengfu Town, [[Bozhou]], [[Anhui]]). He descended from an aristocrat family in H\u00e1n. His grandfather served three generations of the H\u00e1n rulers as [[Chancellor of China|chancellor]]s while his father served two generations. Zhang Liang missed the opportunity to inherit his family's legacy as the H\u00e1n state was annexed by the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] in 230 BC as part of [[Qin's wars of unification]].\n\n==Becoming a Fugitive==\n\n===Assassination attempt on Qin Shi Huang===\nTo avenge the fall of his native state, Zhang Liang dedicated his efforts to [[hitman|hiring assassins]] to kill the Qin emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]]. He spent his entire family fortune and failed to give his deceased younger brother a proper funeral. He managed to find a man with great physical strength to help him, and had an iron hammer weighing 120 ancient [[Catty|catties]] (roughly 160&nbsp;lbs. or 72&nbsp;kg) forged for the strongman. In 218 BC, Zhang Liang heard that Qin Shi Huang was going to Yangwu County (east of present-day [[Yuanyang County, Henan|Yuanyang County]], [[Henan]]) as part of his inspection tour, and was due to pass by Bolangsha during the journey.\n\nZhang Liang and the strongman lay in ambush at Bolangsha and waited for the emperor's convoy to approach.

One day, Zhang Liang took a stroll at Yishui Bridge and met an old man there. The man walked towards Zhang Liang and chucked his shoe down the bridge on purpose, after which he yelled at Zhang, \"Hey boy, go down and fetch me my shoe!\" Zhang Liang was astonished and unhappy but obeyed silently. The old man then lifted his foot and ordered Zhang Liang to put on the shoe for him. Zhang Liang was furious but he controlled his temper and meekly obliged. The man did not show any sign of gratitude and walked away laughing.\n\nThe old man came back after walking a distance and praised Zhang Liang, \"This child can be taught!\"<ref>(\u5b7a\u5b50\u53ef\u6559\u77e3!)</ref> and asked Zhang Liang to meet him at the bridge again at dawn five days later. Zhang Liang was confused but agreed. Five days later, Zhang Liang rushed to the bridge at the stroke of dawn but the old man was already waiting for him there. The old man chided him, \"How can you be late for a meeting with an elderly man? Come back again five days later!\" Zhang Liang tried his best to be punctual the second time but the old man still arrived earlier than him, and he was scorned by the old man once more and told to return again five days later. The third time, Zhang Liang went to the bridge at midnight and waited until the old man appeared. This time, the old man was impressed with Zhang Liang's fortitude and humility, that he presented Zhang with a book, saying, \"You can become the tutor of a ruler after reading this book. Within ten years, the world will become chaotic. You can then use your knowledge from this book to bring peace and prosperity to the empire. Meet me again 13 years later. I'm the yellow rock at the foot of Mount Gucheng.\"\n\nThe old man was Huang Shigong (\u9ec3\u77f3\u516c; lit. \"Yellow Rock Old Man\") . The book was titled ''The Art of War by Taigong'' (\u592a\u516c\u5175\u6cd5) and believed to be the ''[[Six Secret Teachings]]'' by [[Jiang Ziya]], while some called it ''[[Three Strategies of Huang Shigong]]''. In legend, Zhang Liang returned to the indicated site 13 years later and did see a yellow rock there. He built a shrine to worship the rock and the rock was buried with him after his death.\n\n==Rebelling against the Qin dynasty==\nIn 209 BC, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], several uprisings erupted throughout China to overthrow the Qin dynasty. Many of these rebel forces claimed to be restoring the former states that were annexed by Qin two decades ago. Zhang Liang rallied about 100 men to start a rebellion as well, but his force was too weak, so he led his followers to join [[Jing Ju]], a pretender to the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. He met [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] during his journey and was impressed with Liu's charisma that he changed his decision and joined Liu instead. Zhang Liang became a temporary advisor to Liu Bang and followed Liu to join [[Xiang Liang]]'s rebel force.\n\nThe following year, Xiang Liang installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Mi Xin]] as King Huai II of Chu after eliminating Jing Ju. Zhang Liang's main goal was to reestablish his native state of [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n]], so he managed to persuade Xiang Liang to do the same for the H\u00e1n state. [[Han Cheng]], a descendant of the royal family of H\u00e1n, was enthroned as King of H\u00e1n, while Zhang Liang was appointed as the H\u00e1n's chancellor. Han Cheng's armies attempted to capture Qin cities that were formerly H\u00e1n territories but did not achieve much success and engaged in guerrilla warfare for about a year. Later that year, Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao and King Huai II put [[Xiang Yu]] (Xiang Liang's nephew) and Liu Bang each in charge of an army to attack Qin, promising that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (heartland of Qin) first would be conferred the title of \"King of Guanzhong\".\n\nIn 207 BC, the combined forces of Liu Bang and Han Cheng conquered Yangzhai (present-day [[Yuzhou City]], [[Henan]]), the former capital of the H\u00e1n state. Han Cheng stayed behind to defend Yangzhai, while Zhang Liang served as a temporary advisor to Liu Bang. Zhang Liang contributed to Liu Bang's eventual victory in the race to Guanzhong for the strategies he proposed. For example, at the battle of Yao Pass, Zhang Liang suggested tricking the Qin commander into surrendering by bribing him with gifts. Liu Bang wanted to accept the surrendered Qin troops into his army but Zhang Liang cautioned him, saying that some of the troops were unwilling to surrender even though their commander agreed. That night, Liu Bang's forces caught the Qin army off guard and scored a major victory. In another incident, Zhang Liang warned Liu Bang against making a detour at Wancheng, because they would be at risk of being surrounded by the enemy if Liu did so.\n\n==Chu\u2013Han Contention==\n{{main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n\nUpon entering the [[Epang Palace]] in [[Xianyang]] (the Qin capital), Liu Bang was strongly tempted by the riches it housed and wanted to stay there forever. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang about overindulgence in sensual pleasures and Liu ordered his men to seal the treasures and move to Bashang to wait for Xiang Yu and the other rebel forces to arrive. During this period of time, Liu Bang heeded Zhang Liang's advice and governed Guanzhong with benevolence, restoring peace and stability, and forbidding his men from pillaging the cities and harming the common people.\n\nIn 206 BC, Xiang Yu's army arrived at [[Hangu Pass]] (eastern gateway to Guanzhong) and Liu ordered his men to prevent Xiang's forces from entering Guanzhong. Xiang Yu was furious when he learnt that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to Guanzhong, and he wanted to kill Liu after being instigated by [[Fan Zeng]] and a defector from Liu's side, Cao Wushang. Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was an old friend of Zhang Liang and he secretly warned Zhang that Xiang Yu was planning to attack Liu Bang. Liu Bang was shocked and fearful when he heard that, as his forces were too weak to counter Xiang Yu. Zhang Liang advised Liu Bang to attend the [[Feast at Hong Gate]] hosted by Xiang Yu, to put Xiang off guard and dismiss Xiang's suspicions that Liu was intending to oppose him. With help from Xiang Bo, Liu Bang managed to survive the dangerous banquet and Xiang Yu dismissed the idea of killing Liu. However, Fan Zeng was dissatisfied and he asked Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang. Xiang Bo intervened again and saved Liu Bang's life.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhang Liang left the tent to find [[Fan Kuai]] to save Liu Bang. Following Zhang Liang's instructions, Fan Kuai burst in and openly chided Xiang Yu, making a speech about Liu Bang's accomplishments and affirming that Liu had no intention of opposing Xiang Yu. Liu Bang left the banquet later on the pretext of going to the latrine and was received by [[Xiahou Ying]], who had been waiting nearby on Zhang Liang's instruction. Zhang Liang remained behind to hold Xiang Yu's attention while Liu Bang escaped. Before leaving, Zhang Liang presented Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng with a pair of jade pieces.\n\n===Eighteen Kingdoms===\n{{Main|Eighteen Kingdoms}}\n\nXiang Yu split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]] later, granting the land of [[Guanzhong]] to [[Three Qins|three surrendered Qin generals]], even though Guanzhong was rightfully Liu Bang's, according to [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise. Liu Bang was relocated to the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) instead and granted the title of \"King of [[Han Dynasty|Han]]\". [[Han Cheng]] retained his rulership as King of [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n]] and Zhang Liang was moved from Liu Bang's side back to H\u00e1n to continue serving as chancellor. Before parting ways, Liu Bang presented Zhang Liang with some gold and pearls, all of which Zhang gave to [[Xiang Bo]]. Zhang Liang also urged Liu Bang to destroy the [[gallery road]]s leading to Bashu during the journey to Hanzhong, in order to reduce Xiang Yu's suspicions that Liu was planning to return and challenge him.\n\nAlthough Han Cheng was the king of H\u00e1n, Xiang Yu did not permit him to govern his kingdom and forced him to accompany him back to his [[Chu (state)|Western Chu]]'s capital of Pengcheng (present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]). Han Cheng was demoted to \"Marquis of Rang\" later and killed on Xiang Yu's orders. Xiang Yu seized Han Cheng's kingdom and made his subordinate [[Zheng Chang]] the new King of H\u00e1n. Zhang Liang was still the chancellor of H\u00e1n under the new arrangement but he was aware of his precarious position, and cognisant of how Xiang Yu had destroyed his hope of restoring the H\u00e1n state. Zhang Liang fled from H\u00e1n later and returned to join Liu Bang in the winter of 206 BC. Liu Bang conferred on Zhang Liang the title of \"Marquis of Chengxin\" and Zhang became a permanent advisor to Liu from that time.\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin and Battle of Pengcheng===\nStarting in 206 BC, after Liu Bang's forces conquered the [[Three Qins]], Liu Bang and Xiang Yu engaged in a four-year-long power struggle for supremacy over China, historically known as the Chu\u2013Han Contention. In 205 BC, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu at the [[Battle of Pengcheng]] and he retreated to Xiayi. Zhang Liang proposed a strategy to Liu Bang to counter Xiang Yu, known as the \"Xiayi Plan\" (\u4e0b\u9091\u4e4b\u8b00). Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice: he sent [[Xiao He]] to persuade Ying Bu to join him; contacted Peng Yue and allied with him; and allowed Han Xin to lead part of his army to attack other territories on the northern front.\n\nIn 204 BC, Liu Bang was trapped by Xiang Yu in [[Xingyang]] and both sides reached a stalemate. [[Li Yiji]] suggested to Liu Bang to recreate the former states of the [[Warring States period]] and install the descendants of their royal families on their respective thrones. This plan was intended to help Liu Bang gain the support of the vassal states' rulers, who would help him in the war against Xiang Yu. However, Zhang Liang disapproved of the plan as he felt that the states were more likely to support [[Chu (state)|Western Chu]] instead as Chu was superior to Han in terms of military might. Liu Bang realised the problem and immediately dismissed Li Yiji's plan.\n\nIn 203 BC, after his victory at the [[Battle of Wei River]], Han Xin conquered the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] and sent a messenger to Liu Bang, requesting that Liu appoint him as the acting King of Qi. Liu was still trapped at Xingyang then and he was furious after hearing the request because he was expecting Han Xin to come to his aid. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang that if he refused to approve Han Xin's request, Han might be discontented and declare independence from Liu, putting them in a dangerous situation. Liu Bang reluctantly agreed and sent Zhang Liang to pass the king's seal to Han Xin. Zhang Liang met Han Xin and succeeded in reaffirming Han's loyalty to Liu Bang.\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nBy late 203 BC, Zhang Liang saw that the tide had turned in favour of Liu Bang, as Xiang Yu had been surrounded on three sides. Together with [[Chen Ping (Han Dynasty)|Chen Ping]], Zhang Liang suggested to Liu Bang to renounce the Treaty of Hong Canal and use the opportunity to eliminate Western Chu. However, at the Battle of Guling, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu because the expected reinforcements from Han Xin and Peng Yue did not arrive. Zhang Liang explained to Liu Bang that Han Xin and Peng Yue did not mobilise their troops because they did not have their fiefs yet, even though they had received their titles of vassal kings. Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice and granted lands to Han Xin and Peng Yue. Two months later, as Zhang Liang predicted, Han Xin and Peng Yue arrived with their armies and formed a coordinated attack on Western Chu together with Liu Bang's force, defeating Xiang Yu at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] in 202 BC.\n\n==In service during the Han dynasty==\nIn 202 BC, after his victory over Xiang Yu, Liu Bang ascended the throne and became historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu of Han\". Following the establishment of the [[Han dynasty]], Zhang Liang remained as a key advisor to Gaozu even though he did not receive any formal appointment as a government minister. Together with Lou Jing, Zhang Liang later suggested for Gaozu to build his capital in [[Chang'an]] instead of [[Luoyang]], as Chang'an was in a more strategic position than Luoyang (fertile land and surrounded by natural defences such as mountain passes). Once, Gaozu noticed that some of his subjects were having a secret discussion and he asked for Zhang Liang's opinion. Zhang Liang told Gaozu that they were plotting a rebellion and Gaozu was shocked. Zhang Liang proceeded to ask Gaozu whom of all his subjects he hated the most. Gaozu mentioned [[Yong Chi]], who had rebelled against him before but surrendered later. Zhang Liang then suggested to Gaozu to grant Yong Chi a noble title, because if the others saw that Gaozu was able to forgive Yong Chi, they would be at ease and would not think of rebelling.\n\nSubsequently, Zhang Liang retired from state affairs and practised [[Taoism]]. In late 201 BC, Gaozu rewarded his subjects who contributed to the dynasty's founding and he conferred the title of \"Marquis of Liu\" on Zhang Liang. In 196 BC, Gaozu left to suppress a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], and requested Zhang Liang to come out of retirement to assist the crown prince, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], in governing the home territories. After returning from the campaign, Gaozu wanted to replace Liu Ying with [[Liu Ruyi]], the Prince of Zhao. Zhang Liang opposed Gaozu's decision but Gaozu ignored him so Zhang feigned illness and retired again. When approached by [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] to help Liu Ying retain his position, Zhang Liang recommended the [[Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang]] to help Liu Ying, and the four men succeeded in convincing Gaozu to keep Liu Ying as the crown prince. Zhang Liang remained in retirement until his death in 186 BC.\n\n==Death and burial place==\n[[File:\u5f20\u5bb6\u754c\u5f20\u826f\u5893.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Zhang Liang Tomb in [[Zhangjiajie]], [[Hunan]].]]\n\nLittle is known about Zhang Liang's later life, hence his final resting place has been a mystery throughout history.\n\nA Zhang Liang Tomb stands at 6&nbsp;km southwest of present-day [[Lankao County]], [[Henan]]. According to legend, during the [[L\u00fc Clan Disturbance]], Zhang Liang moved to Mount Baiyun at the southwest of Donghun County (present-day [[Lankao County]], [[Henan]]), and was buried there after his death. A Zhang Liang Temple used to stand beside the tomb, but it was destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nAnother Zhang Liang Tomb stands at south of [[Weishan County, Shandong|Weishan County]], [[Shandong]]. The stone tablet in front of the grave bearing Zhang Liang's name was erected in 1737 during the [[Qing dynasty]]. A Zhang Liang Shrine also used to stand east of the tomb, but it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nHowever, some believed that Zhang Liang's tomb was in present-day [[Pei County]], [[Xuzhou]]. According to the 7th-century gazetteer ''[[Kuodi Zhi]]'', Zhang Liang's tomb was 65 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' east of Pei County, near Liucheng, where a Zhang Liang Temple was also located.\n\nAccording to ''Xianshizhi'' (\u4ed9\u91cb\u5fd7) and ''Lingmuzhi'' (\u9675\u5893\u5fd7), Zhang Liang's tomb was at Mount Qingyan in [[Hunan]].\n\n==Modern references==\nAn article in ''Xianzhuan Shiyi'' (\u4ed9\u50b3\u62fe\u907a) tells the story of how Zhang Liang became an immortal.<ref name=\"Xianzhuan Shiyi\">{{in lang|zh}} [http://mag.epochtimes.com/b5/016/2939.htm \u5f20\u826f \u4fee\u70bc\u6210\u4ed9\u7684\u6545\u4e8b] (''The story of how Zhang Liang became an immortal'')</ref> Zhang Liang practised some of the book's teachings and attained some magical powers. Zhang Liang was buried at Dragon Head Plains (\u9f8d\u9996\u539f) after his death. In legend, Zhang Liang's tomb was raided when the [[Chimei|Red Brows Army]] revolted, and the robbers saw a yellow stone pillow inside his tomb. The pillow transformed swiftly and flew away like a shooting star, and nothing else was found in the tomb, not even Zhang Liang's body. Zhang Liang became an immortal and served [[Laozi]] as an assistant. Zhang Liang's grandson, [[Zhang Daoling]], became an immortal, too, and he went with his grandfather to meet the [[Queen Mother of the West]] on [[Mount Kunlun]].<ref name=\"Xianzhuan Shiyi\" />\n\nZhang Liang's encounter with Huang Shigong had also become one of the classic Chinese folk tales about humility for later generations to learn from.\n\nZhang Liang is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI]]'' by [[Koei]]. He has higher intelligence stats than all these characters, except for [[Jiang Ziya]]. Zhang Liang is also a playable character of the \"Wizard\" class in the action RPG ''[[Prince of Qin (video game)|Prince of Qin]]''.\n\nHe also appears as a character in the animation series ''[[The Legend of Qin (animated TV series)|The Legend of Qin]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Zhang Liang}}\n{{Reflist}}\n*[[Sima Qian]].

Zhang Liang contributed greatly to the establishment of the Han dynasty. After his death, he was honoured with the [[Posthumous name|posthumous title]] \"Marquis Wencheng\" by [[Emperor Qianshao of Han|Emperor Qianshao]].\n\n==Early life==\nZhang Liang was born in Xinzheng{{original research inline|date=November 2016}} (\u65b0\u912d; present-day [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]]), the capital of the [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n state]](\u97d3\u570b), while his [[Ancestral home (China)|ancestral home]] was in Chengfu (\u57ce\u7236; present-day Chengfu Town, [[Bozhou]], [[Anhui]]). He descended from an aristocrat family in H\u00e1n. His grandfather served three generations of the H\u00e1n rulers as [[Chancellor of China|chancellor]]s while his father served two generations. Zhang Liang missed the opportunity to inherit his family's legacy as the H\u00e1n state was annexed by the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] in 230 BC as part of [[Qin's wars of unification]].\n\n==Becoming a Fugitive==\n\n===Assassination attempt on Qin Shi Huang===\nTo avenge the fall of his native state, Zhang Liang dedicated his efforts to [[hitman|hiring assassins]] to kill the Qin emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]].

In another incident, Zhang Liang warned Liu Bang against making a detour at Wancheng, because they would be at risk of being surrounded by the enemy if Liu did so.\n\n==Chu\u2013Han Contention==\n{{main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n\nUpon entering the [[Epang Palace]] in [[Xianyang]] (the Qin capital), Liu Bang was strongly tempted by the riches it housed and wanted to stay there forever. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang about overindulgence in sensual pleasures and Liu ordered his men to seal the treasures and move to Bashang to wait for Xiang Yu and the other rebel forces to arrive. During this period of time, Liu Bang heeded Zhang Liang's advice and governed Guanzhong with benevolence, restoring peace and stability, and forbidding his men from pillaging the cities and harming the common people.\n\nIn 206 BC, Xiang Yu's army arrived at [[Hangu Pass]] (eastern gateway to Guanzhong) and Liu ordered his men to prevent Xiang's forces from entering Guanzhong. Xiang Yu was furious when he learnt that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to Guanzhong, and he wanted to kill Liu after being instigated by [[Fan Zeng]] and a defector from Liu's side, Cao Wushang. Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was an old friend of Zhang Liang and he secretly warned Zhang that Xiang Yu was planning to attack Liu Bang. Liu Bang was shocked and fearful when he heard that, as his forces were too weak to counter Xiang Yu. Zhang Liang advised Liu Bang to attend the [[Feast at Hong Gate]] hosted by Xiang Yu, to put Xiang off guard and dismiss Xiang's suspicions that Liu was intending to oppose him. With help from Xiang Bo, Liu Bang managed to survive the dangerous banquet and Xiang Yu dismissed the idea of killing Liu. However, Fan Zeng was dissatisfied and he asked Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang. Xiang Bo intervened again and saved Liu Bang's life.\n\nMeanwhile, Zhang Liang left the tent to find [[Fan Kuai]] to save Liu Bang. Following Zhang Liang's instructions, Fan Kuai burst in and openly chided Xiang Yu, making a speech about Liu Bang's accomplishments and affirming that Liu had no intention of opposing Xiang Yu. Liu Bang left the banquet later on the pretext of going to the latrine and was received by [[Xiahou Ying]], who had been waiting nearby on Zhang Liang's instruction. Zhang Liang remained behind to hold Xiang Yu's attention while Liu Bang escaped. Before leaving, Zhang Liang presented Xiang Yu and Fan Zeng with a pair of jade pieces.\n\n===Eighteen Kingdoms===\n{{Main|Eighteen Kingdoms}}\n\nXiang Yu split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]] later, granting the land of [[Guanzhong]] to [[Three Qins|three surrendered Qin generals]], even though Guanzhong was rightfully Liu Bang's, according to [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise. Liu Bang was relocated to the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) instead and granted the title of \"King of [[Han Dynasty|Han]]\". [[Han Cheng]] retained his rulership as King of [[Han (state)|H\u00e1n]] and Zhang Liang was moved from Liu Bang's side back to H\u00e1n to continue serving as chancellor. Before parting ways, Liu Bang presented Zhang Liang with some gold and pearls, all of which Zhang gave to [[Xiang Bo]]. Zhang Liang also urged Liu Bang to destroy the [[gallery road]]s leading to Bashu during the journey to Hanzhong, in order to reduce Xiang Yu's suspicions that Liu was planning to return and challenge him.\n\nAlthough Han Cheng was the king of H\u00e1n, Xiang Yu did not permit him to govern his kingdom and forced him to accompany him back to his [[Chu (state)|Western Chu]]'s capital of Pengcheng (present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]). Han Cheng was demoted to \"Marquis of Rang\" later and killed on Xiang Yu's orders. Xiang Yu seized Han Cheng's kingdom and made his subordinate [[Zheng Chang]] the new King of H\u00e1n. Zhang Liang was still the chancellor of H\u00e1n under the new arrangement but he was aware of his precarious position, and cognisant of how Xiang Yu had destroyed his hope of restoring the H\u00e1n state. Zhang Liang fled from H\u00e1n later and returned to join Liu Bang in the winter of 206 BC. Liu Bang conferred on Zhang Liang the title of \"Marquis of Chengxin\" and Zhang became a permanent advisor to Liu from that time.\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin and Battle of Pengcheng===\nStarting in 206 BC, after Liu Bang's forces conquered the [[Three Qins]], Liu Bang and Xiang Yu engaged in a four-year-long power struggle for supremacy over China, historically known as the Chu\u2013Han Contention. In 205 BC, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu at the [[Battle of Pengcheng]] and he retreated to Xiayi. Zhang Liang proposed a strategy to Liu Bang to counter Xiang Yu, known as the \"Xiayi Plan\" (\u4e0b\u9091\u4e4b\u8b00). Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice: he sent [[Xiao He]] to persuade Ying Bu to join him; contacted Peng Yue and allied with him; and allowed Han Xin to lead part of his army to attack other territories on the northern front.\n\nIn 204 BC, Liu Bang was trapped by Xiang Yu in [[Xingyang]] and both sides reached a stalemate. [[Li Yiji]] suggested to Liu Bang to recreate the former states of the [[Warring States period]] and install the descendants of their royal families on their respective thrones. This plan was intended to help Liu Bang gain the support of the vassal states' rulers, who would help him in the war against Xiang Yu. However, Zhang Liang disapproved of the plan as he felt that the states were more likely to support [[Chu (state)|Western Chu]] instead as Chu was superior to Han in terms of military might. Liu Bang realised the problem and immediately dismissed Li Yiji's plan.\n\nIn 203 BC, after his victory at the [[Battle of Wei River]], Han Xin conquered the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] and sent a messenger to Liu Bang, requesting that Liu appoint him as the acting King of Qi. Liu was still trapped at Xingyang then and he was furious after hearing the request because he was expecting Han Xin to come to his aid. Zhang Liang reminded Liu Bang that if he refused to approve Han Xin's request, Han might be discontented and declare independence from Liu, putting them in a dangerous situation. Liu Bang reluctantly agreed and sent Zhang Liang to pass the king's seal to Han Xin. Zhang Liang met Han Xin and succeeded in reaffirming Han's loyalty to Liu Bang.\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nBy late 203 BC, Zhang Liang saw that the tide had turned in favour of Liu Bang, as Xiang Yu had been surrounded on three sides. Together with [[Chen Ping (Han Dynasty)|Chen Ping]], Zhang Liang suggested to Liu Bang to renounce the Treaty of Hong Canal and use the opportunity to eliminate Western Chu. However, at the Battle of Guling, Liu Bang was defeated by Xiang Yu because the expected reinforcements from Han Xin and Peng Yue did not arrive. Zhang Liang explained to Liu Bang that Han Xin and Peng Yue did not mobilise their troops because they did not have their fiefs yet, even though they had received their titles of vassal kings. Liu Bang followed Zhang Liang's advice and granted lands to Han Xin and Peng Yue. Two months later, as Zhang Liang predicted, Han Xin and Peng Yue arrived with their armies and formed a coordinated attack on Western Chu together with Liu Bang's force, defeating Xiang Yu at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] in 202 BC.\n\n==In service during the Han dynasty==\nIn 202 BC, after his victory over Xiang Yu, Liu Bang ascended the throne and became historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu of Han\". Following the establishment of the [[Han dynasty]], Zhang Liang remained as a key advisor to Gaozu even though he did not receive any formal appointment as a government minister. Together with Lou Jing, Zhang Liang later suggested for Gaozu to build his capital in [[Chang'an]] instead of [[Luoyang]], as Chang'an was in a more strategic position than Luoyang (fertile land and surrounded by natural defences such as mountain passes). Once, Gaozu noticed that some of his subjects were having a secret discussion and he asked for Zhang Liang's opinion. Zhang Liang told Gaozu that they were plotting a rebellion and Gaozu was shocked. Zhang Liang proceeded to ask Gaozu whom of all his subjects he hated the most. Gaozu mentioned [[Yong Chi]], who had rebelled against him before but surrendered later. Zhang Liang then suggested to Gaozu to grant Yong Chi a noble title, because if the others saw that Gaozu was able to forgive Yong Chi, they would be at ease and would not think of rebelling.\n\nSubsequently, Zhang Liang retired from state affairs and practised [[Taoism]]. In late 201 BC, Gaozu rewarded his subjects who contributed to the dynasty's founding and he conferred the title of \"Marquis of Liu\" on Zhang Liang. In 196 BC, Gaozu left to suppress a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], and requested Zhang Liang to come out of retirement to assist the crown prince, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], in governing the home territories. After returning from the campaign, Gaozu wanted to replace Liu Ying with [[Liu Ruyi]], the Prince of Zhao. Zhang Liang opposed Gaozu's decision but Gaozu ignored him so Zhang feigned illness and retired again. When approached by [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] to help Liu Ying retain his position, Zhang Liang recommended the [[Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang]] to help Liu Ying, and the four men succeeded in convincing Gaozu to keep Liu Ying as the crown prince. Zhang Liang remained in retirement until his death in 186 BC.\n\n==Death and burial place==\n[[File:\u5f20\u5bb6\u754c\u5f20\u826f\u5893.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The Zhang Liang Tomb in [[Zhangjiajie]], [[Hunan]].]]\n\nLittle is known about Zhang Liang's later life, hence his final resting place has been a mystery throughout history.\n\nA Zhang Liang Tomb stands at 6&nbsp;km southwest of present-day [[Lankao County]], [[Henan]]. According to legend, during the [[L\u00fc Clan Disturbance]], Zhang Liang moved to Mount Baiyun at the southwest of Donghun County (present-day [[Lankao County]], [[Henan]]), and was buried there after his death. A Zhang Liang Temple used to stand beside the tomb, but it was destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nAnother Zhang Liang Tomb stands at south of [[Weishan County, Shandong|Weishan County]], [[Shandong]]. The stone tablet in front of the grave bearing Zhang Liang's name was erected in 1737 during the [[Qing dynasty]]. A Zhang Liang Shrine also used to stand east of the tomb, but it was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nHowever, some believed that Zhang Liang's tomb was in present-day [[Pei County]], [[Xuzhou]]. According to the 7th-century gazetteer ''[[Kuodi Zhi]]'', Zhang Liang's tomb was 65 ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' east of Pei County, near Liucheng, where a Zhang Liang Temple was also located.\n\nAccording to ''Xianshizhi'' (\u4ed9\u91cb\u5fd7) and ''Lingmuzhi'' (\u9675\u5893\u5fd7), Zhang Liang's tomb was at Mount Qingyan in [[Hunan]].\n\n==Modern references==\nAn article in ''Xianzhuan Shiyi'' (\u4ed9\u50b3\u62fe\u907a) tells the story of how Zhang Liang became an immortal.<ref name=\"Xianzhuan Shiyi\">{{in lang|zh}} [http://mag.epochtimes.com/b5/016/2939.htm \u5f20\u826f \u4fee\u70bc\u6210\u4ed9\u7684\u6545\u4e8b] (''The story of how Zhang Liang became an immortal'')</ref> Zhang Liang practised some of the book's teachings and attained some magical powers. Zhang Liang was buried at Dragon Head Plains (\u9f8d\u9996\u539f) after his death. In legend, Zhang Liang's tomb was raided when the [[Chimei|Red Brows Army]] revolted, and the robbers saw a yellow stone pillow inside his tomb. The pillow transformed swiftly and flew away like a shooting star, and nothing else was found in the tomb, not even Zhang Liang's body. Zhang Liang became an immortal and served [[Laozi]] as an assistant. Zhang Liang's grandson, [[Zhang Daoling]], became an immortal, too, and he went with his grandfather to meet the [[Queen Mother of the West]] on [[Mount Kunlun]].<ref name=\"Xianzhuan Shiyi\" />\n\nZhang Liang's encounter with Huang Shigong had also become one of the classic Chinese folk tales about humility for later generations to learn from.\n\nZhang Liang is one of the 32 historical figures who appear as special characters in the video game ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms XI]]'' by [[Koei]]. He has higher intelligence stats than all these characters, except for [[Jiang Ziya]]. Zhang Liang is also a playable character of the \"Wizard\" class in the action RPG ''[[Prince of Qin (video game)|Prince of Qin]]''.\n\nHe also appears as a character in the animation series ''[[The Legend of Qin (animated TV series)|The Legend of Qin]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Zhang Liang}}\n{{Reflist}}\n*[[Sima Qian]].

Jordanes also states that the king put to death a young woman named Sunilda ([[Svanhildr]]) with the use of horses, because of her infidelity. Thereupon her two brothers, Sarus and [[Ammius]], severely wounded Ermanaric leaving him unfit to defend his kingdom from Hunnic incursions. Variations of this legend had a profound effect on medieval Germanic literature, including that of [[England]] and [[Scandinavia]] (see [[Jonakr's sons]]). Jordanes claims that he successfully ruled the [[Goths]] until his death at the age of 110.\n\n[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] gives the version of Ammianus and Jordanes as historical, reporting that Ermanaric successively conquered, during a reign of about 30 years from 337 to 367 A.D., the [[Thervingi|west-goths]], the [[Heruli]], the [[Venedi]] and the [[Aestii]], establishing a kingdom which ranged from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Black Sea]];<ref>Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire'', (The Modern Library, 1932), chap.

Jordanes claims that he successfully ruled the [[Goths]] until his death at the age of 110.\n\n[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]] gives the version of Ammianus and Jordanes as historical, reporting that Ermanaric successively conquered, during a reign of about 30 years from 337 to 367 A.D., the [[Thervingi|west-goths]], the [[Heruli]], the [[Venedi]] and the [[Aestii]], establishing a kingdom which ranged from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to the [[Black Sea]];<ref>Edward Gibbon, ''The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire'', (The Modern Library, 1932), chap. XXV., pp. 890, 891</ref> and died at the age of 110 of a wound inflicted by the brothers of a woman whom he had cruelly executed for her husband's revolt, being succeeded by his brother [[Vithimiris]].<ref>Gibbon, Ibid. chap.

In the former, the poem [[Beowulf]]  focused on the image of \"Eormenric's wiles and hatred\".<ref>[[Seamus Heaney]] trans., ''Beowulf'' (London 2000) p. 40</ref> According to [[J. R. R. Tolkien|Tolkien]], he is described in the 10th century poem  [[Deor]] as a powerful but perilous king: \"We have heard of the wolfish mind of Eormanric: far and wide he ruled the people of the realm of the Goths: he was a cruel king\".<ref name=\"Tolkien2009\">[[Deor]], quoted in J R R Tolkien, ''The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun'' (London 2009) p. 322-323.</ref>\n\nErmanaric also appears in the Norse sources, such as ''[[Thidreks Saga]]'', in which he is ill-advised by his counsellors to put his own wife to death for supposed adultery with his son, for which revenge is taken by his brothers-in-law.<ref name=\"Tanner1929\">J.

It runs in a northerly direction, as Saddlebow Road, through the [[King\u2019s Lynn]] suburb of South Lynn. In just over {{convert|1/2|mi}} Safdlebow Road becomes [[Wisbech]] Road and crosses the [[River Nar]]. The road now joins a roundabout at the bottom end of King's Lynn. At this roundabout the [[A149 road|A149]], Hardwick Road, runs of to the right whilst the B1144 is straight across the island and runs around the eastern skirt of the town. The A148 turns right and northward and is now called [[London]] Road. The road soon passes under the South Gate of what were once the town's defences. This gateway was built during the Reign of Edward III. It is brick built with stone surrounds to the arches. The gate only straddles the northbound carriage way and was restored at a cost of \u00a380,000<ref>[http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/Default.aspx?page=21853 Borough Council of King's Lynn & West Norfolk: South Gate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201834/http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/Default.aspx?page=21853 |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref> in 1982. The road now takes a route through the heart of King's Lynn as St James Road and after {{convert|1.3|mi|km}} enters a one way system as Railway Road. At {{convert|1.5|mi}} the road turns right into Austin Road and at its [[Junction (traffic)|junction]] with Littleport Road it reverts to a two way carriageway again, and after a short distance crosses a bridge over the [[Gaywood River]] and becomes Gaywood Road. The road soon passes the [[King Edward VII School (King's Lynn)|King Edward VII School]] on the right and on out into the Suburb of Gaywood. Gaywood road then becomes Lynn Road and now after {{convert|2.5|mi}} from the start the road takes a left turn into Wooton Road. The road direction is now to the north east towards South Wooton. At {{convert|3.8|mi|km}} the road comes to a 'T' Junction controlled by traffic lights. From the left is the A1078 which terminates at this junction and to the right the A148 continues on its way out of King's Lynn. Now Grimston Road, the road inclines towards a large roundabout.\n\n===King\u2019s Lynn to Hillington===\n\nIt is now {{convert|5.3|mi|km}} since the start and the roundabout is the junction with the [[A149 road|A149]] Queen Elizabeth Way. The A148 continues on over the roundabout now signposted to Fakenham and Cromer. The road is now characterised by long straights through dense woodland on both sides of the carriageway. After {{convert|8.4|mi|km}} the road crosses the [[River Cong (Norfolk)|River Cong]], and a turning on the left which is the B1440 to [[Sandringham, Norfolk|Sandringham]] and the [[Sandringham House|Royal Estate]] there. At {{convert|8.5|mi}} the village of [[Hillington, Norfolk|Hillington]] is reached. On the left as you enter the village is a filling station and the three-hundred-year-old [[coaching inn]] called the Ffolkes Arms Hotel. Many years ago the attic rooms of this Inn were used to lock up prisoners overnight who were being transported to Norwich Prison.<ref>{{cite web |title= Ffolkes Arms Hotel, Lynn Road, Hillington, King's Lynn | url= http://www.4hotels.co.uk/uk/hotels/ffolkesarms.html | accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> {{convert|100|yd|m}} further on from the hotel is the gatehouse entrance to Hillington Hall. This estate once extended over {{convert|8000|acre|km2}} of the Norfolk Countryside and was the home Ffolkes family who purchased it in 1678. The purchaser was Martin Ffolkes who was the Attorney-General to [[Catherine of Braganza|Queen Catherine]] who was the wife of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].\n\n===Hillington to Fakenham===\nThe road now skirts the boundary wall of Hillington Park on its left and passes the B1153 (southbound) to [[Grimston, Norfolk|Grimston]] on the right. At the end of the wall on the left the road passes the junction with the northbound B1153 to [[Flitcham]]. The road now heads in an easterly direction over undulating [[King's Lynn and West Norfolk|West Norfolk]] countryside towards [[Harpley, Norfolk|Harpley]]. At the {{convert|12.2|mi|km|adj=on}} mark, the long distant footpath [[Peddars Way]] cross the road south to north at Harpley Dams just before the village. Peddars way is an old [[Roman road]]. From here the road inclines sharply. The road has an overtaking lane on the Eastbound carriage way which allows passing only on that carriage way and is marked with double white lines on the westbound carriageway. The village Harpley is bypassed on the right hand side. A brown [[tourist signpost]] on the left points out the road to nearby [[Houghton Hall]] just out of the village. The next section of the road towards the villages of [[East Rudham|East]] and [[West Rudham]] are characterised by long straight sections of road. Now having travelled {{convert|15.5|mi}} from the beginning the road reaches West Rudham. In the heart of the village on the left is a 17th-century Inn called the Duke\u2019s Head. The pub is a free house and has log fires. At {{convert|16.2|mi|km}} the road passes through East Rudham passing on the left side of the village green and the Crown public house which is located on the eastern side of the green. On the way out of the village the road also passes a pub on the left called the Cat and Fiddle but was formally the Bakers Arms. Further on the road reaches the villages of [[Tattersett]] on the left and [[Coxford, Norfolk|Coxford]] on the right and crosses the [[Culvert]] of the [[River Tat]] a [[tributary]] of the [[River Wensum]] although you can not see the river from the road. After passing the junction of the B1454 to [[Docking, Norfolk|Docking]] on the left ({{convert|18|mi}}), the road now crosses an area of rolling hills and dips and passes the former airbase of [[RAF Sculthorpe]] on left. The road then drops down towards the village of [[Sculthorpe, Norfolk|Sculthorpe]] by-passing it on the left. At {{convert|21.6|mi|km}} the road passes the junction of the B1355 to [[South Creake]] and the Burnhams on the left. This stretch of road between this junction and before reaching a traffic island which marks the start of the [[Fakenham]] by-pass, is called Creake Road.\n\n===Fakenham to Cromer===\n\n[[File:A148 Into Cromer.JPG|thumb|250px|The road drops down into the heart of Cromer]]\nAt the roundabout the A1065 from [[Swaffham]] joins from the right. Straight across is the old route of the road called Wells Road which takes you into the center of Fakenham. The A148 bares left and now by-passes the town swinging around to the north passing the B1105 to [[Wells-next-the-Sea]] on the left. Now at {{convert|23.5|mi}} the road comes to another roundabout. The road to the right is A1067 from [[Norwich]] which terminates at the island. Straight over the island is the continuing A148.\nThe next stretch of road sees the first [[speed camera]] at {{convert|24.5|mi}} from the King's Lynn start point. According to the Norfolk Safety Camera Partnership, the siting of this camera has resulted in only 1% of drivers breaking the speed limit along this section of the road, although before and after accident figures are not available.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.norfolk-safety-camera.org.uk/index.php?page=fixedinfo |title=Norfolk Safety Camera Partnership |access-date=20 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201000516/http://norfolk-safety-camera.org.uk/index.php?page=fixedinfo |archive-date=1 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Junction right to [[Kettlestone]] just past this site has always been a notorious accident Black Spot, as has the staggered cross road Junction at [[Little Snoring]] just beyond. At {{convert|25.5|mi}} the road passes through part of Little Snoring and through a cross road junction with Snoring Road. On the right just past the junction is [[Green Man|the Green Man]] [[Public House]]. For the next {{convert|2|mi}} the road dips and rise through scenic woodland on either side of the road crossing the [[River Stiffkey]] at Brookhill plantation. On the right at Thursford is another filling station and a restaurant called the Old Forge. Dating from the 14th century the old forge was once a coaching station and many years ago was a resting place for [[pilgrim]]s making their way to [[Our Lady of Walsingham|Walsingham Abbey]]. Today it is a popular [[seafood]] restaurant. Now at {{convert|27.6|mi}} since the start, the road emerges from the woodland and reaches a junction where the B1354 sweeps away to the right towards [[Melton Constable]]. The A148 swings northeast up an incline over a crossroads and past the [[Crawfish]] public house on the left which serves Thai food. The route now inclines and straightens out passing through more [[woodland]] before entering an area of open countryside. This long straight takes you to another filling station on the left. [[Bale, Norfolk|Bale]] Filling station marks {{convert|29.3|mi|km}} from the start.\n[[File:Safety Cameras at Bale Norfolk 22nd Oct 2007 (1).JPG|thumb|180px|Speed camera site at Bale]]\n500m from the garage is the second and last speed camera<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://norfolk-safety-camera.org.uk/index.php?page=pdf-viewer&pdf=Fixed%20Site%20-%20A148%20Bale%20-%20F9.pdf |title=Norfolk Safety Camera Partnership - PDF Viewer<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=21 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025133041/http://norfolk-safety-camera.org.uk/index.php?page=pdf-viewer&pdf=Fixed%20Site%20-%20A148%20Bale%20-%20F9.pdf |archive-date=25 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> on the A148. Once again the placing of this camera has been a deterrent to speeding with only 2% of drivers passing this point breaking the [[speed limit]], although again it is not clear whether this has resulted in a reduction of accidents. From the camera's location the road takes a long sweeping bend toward the north east and once again the road is characterised by long straight section across open countryside. At {{convert|31.3|mi|km}} the road to the left at the crossroads is the [[B1156 road|B1156]] to the village of [[Langham, Norfolk|Langham]], the right hand lane leads to the village of [[Sharrington]]. {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} further on from the crossroads the road narrows in width and enters a section that is undulating and includes some very sharp blind bends. Drivers should be mindful of the fact that this road is used considerably by HGVs and this section should be driven with great care. At {{convert|33.3|mi|km}} the road passes through the village of [[Letheringsett]]. On the right in the centre of the village is the Kings Head Public House which is a fine example of a Georgian Building. Also on this junction is one of two Watermills in the village. The road crosses the [[River Glaven]] next to this redundant mill and 100 m further on passes a Brown Tourist sign locating the second Watermill on the right. Letheringsett Watermill<ref>[http://www.letheringsettwatermill.co.uk/ Letheringsett Watermill, Holt, Norwich, Norfolk, milling demonstrations, wholewheat flour, spelt flour<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is the last remaining watermill in Norfolk to produce flour. From Letheringsett the road inclines towards the Town of [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]] reaching the western end of the town center at {{convert|34.4|mi|km}}. In the past the A148 passed through the center of this Georgian town but today it by-passes the center. At the next roundabout the road turns left on to the bypass. The road to the right is the B1110 to [[Melton Constable]], the road straight over the island is the [[B1149 road|B1149]] to [[Norwich]]. The by-pass was built on the old track bed of the [[Midland & Great Northern Joint Railway]]. At {{convert|35.8|mi|km}} the road from the left marks the point were the by-pass rejoins the old route of the A148. Just before this junction is Holt Station on the preserved part of the afore mentioned railway. It is the [[North Norfolk Railway]] which runs from [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]] via [[Weybourne, Norfolk|Weybourne]] to [[Sheringham]].

At {{convert|40.4|mi|km}} is the left hand turn to [[Beeston Regis]] (the location of the top picture of the road sign). Continuing on and the road passes a public house called the Roman Camp Inn on the right hand side of the road. There is a filling station here also on the right. Beacon Hill is a {{convert|1/4|mi}} on the left but is not visible as the road here is shrouded with dense woodland on both verges. The woodland on the right hand side of the road marks the boundary of the Felbrigg Estate, also in the hands of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. After {{convert|42.6|mi|km}} the next junction on the left is the [[B1436 road|B1436]] to [[Roughton, Norfolk|Roughton]]. Reaching the final part of the road the route now crosses the bridge of the [[Bittern Line]] railway that links Norwich to Cromer and [[Sheringham]], and drops down the Cromer Ridge, past the [[North Norfolk District Council Headquarters]] on the right into the town of Cromer. At {{convert|43.5|mi|km}} there is a filling station on the right operated by [[British Petroleum]]. At this section, the road has the designation of Holt road before becoming West Street after a Mini roundabout as it approaches the town Center.

[[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]] is incorrectly displayed as a [[List of primary destinations on the United Kingdom road network|Primary Destination]], though as Holt is the next major town, it is displayed for navigation purposes]]\nStarting at the western end, A148 starts as an exit from a roundabout on the [[A47 road|A47]]. It runs in a northerly direction, as Saddlebow Road, through the [[King\u2019s Lynn]] suburb of South Lynn. In just over {{convert|1/2|mi}} Safdlebow Road becomes [[Wisbech]] Road and crosses the [[River Nar]]. The road now joins a roundabout at the bottom end of King's Lynn. At this roundabout the [[A149 road|A149]], Hardwick Road, runs of to the right whilst the B1144 is straight across the island and runs around the eastern skirt of the town. The A148 turns right and northward and is now called [[London]] Road. The road soon passes under the South Gate of what were once the town's defences. This gateway was built during the Reign of Edward III. It is brick built with stone surrounds to the arches. The gate only straddles the northbound carriage way and was restored at a cost of \u00a380,000<ref>[http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/Default.aspx?page=21853 Borough Council of King's Lynn & West Norfolk: South Gate] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201834/http://www.west-norfolk.gov.uk/Default.aspx?page=21853 |date=27 September 2007 }}</ref> in 1982. The road now takes a route through the heart of King's Lynn as St James Road and after {{convert|1.3|mi|km}} enters a one way system as Railway Road. At {{convert|1.5|mi}} the road turns right into Austin Road and at its [[Junction (traffic)|junction]] with Littleport Road it reverts to a two way carriageway again, and after a short distance crosses a bridge over the [[Gaywood River]] and becomes Gaywood Road. The road soon passes the [[King Edward VII School (King's Lynn)|King Edward VII School]] on the right and on out into the Suburb of Gaywood. Gaywood road then becomes Lynn Road and now after {{convert|2.5|mi}} from the start the road takes a left turn into Wooton Road. The road direction is now to the north east towards South Wooton. At {{convert|3.8|mi|km}} the road comes to a 'T' Junction controlled by traffic lights. From the left is the A1078 which terminates at this junction and two the right the A148 continues on its way out of King's Lynn. Now Grimston Road, the road inclines towards a large roundabout.\n\n===King\u2019s Lynn to Hillington===\n\nIt is now {{convert|5.3|mi|km}} since the start and the roundabout is the junction with the [[A149 road|A149]] Queen Elizabeth Way. The A148 continues on over the roundabout now signposted to Fakenham and Cromer. The road is now characterised by long straights through dense woodland on both sides of the carriageway. After {{convert|8.4|mi|km}} the road crosses the [[River Cong (Norfolk)|River Cong]], and a turning on the left which is the B1440 to [[Sandringham, Norfolk|Sandringham]] and the [[Sandringham House|Royal Estate]] there. At {{convert|8.5|mi}} the village of [[Hillington, Norfolk|Hillington]] is reached. On the left as you enter the village is a filling station and the three-hundred-year-old [[coaching inn]] called the Ffolkes Arms Hotel. Many years ago the attic rooms of this Inn were used to lock up prisoners overnight who were being transported to Norwich Prison.<ref>{{cite web |title= Ffolkes Arms Hotel, Lynn Road, Hillington, King's Lynn | url= http://www.4hotels.co.uk/uk/hotels/ffolkesarms.html | accessdate=2007-11-14}}</ref> {{convert|100|yd|m}} further on from the hotel is the gatehouse entrance to Hillington Hall. This estate once extended over {{convert|8000|acre|km2}} of the Norfolk Countryside and was the home Ffolkes family who purchased it in 1678. The purchaser was Martin Ffolkes who was the Attorney-General to [[Catherine of Braganza|Queen Catherine]] who was the wife of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].\n\n===Hillington to Fakenham===\nThe road now skirts the boundary wall of Hillington Park on its left and passes the B1153 (southbound) to [[Grimston, Norfolk|Grimston]] on the right. At the end of the wall on the left the road passes the junction with the northbound B1153 to [[Flitcham]]. The road now heads in an easterly direction over undulating [[King's Lynn and West Norfolk|West Norfolk]] countryside towards [[Harpley, Norfolk|Harpley]]. At the {{convert|12.2|mi|km|sing=on}} mark, the long distant footpath [[Peddars Way]] cross the road south to north at Harpley Dams just before the village. Peddars way is an old [[Roman road]]. From here the road inclines sharply. The road has an overtaking lane on the Eastbound carriage way which allows passing only on that carriage way and is marked with double white lines on the westbound carriageway. The village Harpley is bypassed on the right hand side. A brown [[tourist signpost]] on the left points out the road to nearby [[Houghton Hall]] just out of the village. The next section of the road towards the villages of [[East Rudham|East]] and [[West Rudham]] are characterised by long straight sections of road. Now having travelled {{convert|15.5|mi}} from the beginning the road reaches West Rudham. In the heart of the village on the left is a 17th-century Inn called the Duke\u2019s Head. The pub is a free house and has log fires. At {{convert|16.2|mi|km}} the road passes through East Rudham passing on the left side of the village green and the Crown public house which is located on the eastern side of the green. On the way out of the village the road also passes a pub on the left called the Cat and Fiddle but was formally the Bakers Arms. Further on the road reaches the villages of [[Tattersett]] on the left and [[Coxford, Norfolk|Coxford]] on the right and crosses the [[Culvert]] of the [[River Tat]] a [[tributary]] of the [[River Wensum]] although you can not see the river from the road. After passing the junction of the B1454 to [[Docking, Norfolk|Docking]] on the left ({{convert|18|mi}}), the road now crosses an area of rolling hills and dips and passes the former airbase of [[RAF Sculthorpe]] on left. The road then drops down towards the village of [[Sculthorpe, Norfolk|Sculthorpe]] by-passing it on the left. At {{convert|21.6|mi|km}} the road passes the junction of the B1355 to [[South Creake]] and the Burnhams on the left. This stretch of road between this junction and before reaching a traffic island which marks the start of the [[Fakenham]] by-pass, is called Creake Road.\n\n===Fakenham to Cromer===\n\n[[File:A148 Into Cromer.JPG|thumb|250px|The road drops down into the heart of Cromer]]\nAt the roundabout the A1065 from [[Swaffham]] joins from the right. Straight across is the old route of the road called Wells Road which takes you into the center of Fakenham. The A148 bares left and now by-passes the town swinging around to the north passing the B1105 to [[Wells-next-the-Sea]] on the left. Now at {{convert|23.5|mi}} the road comes to another roundabout. The road to the right is A1067 from [[Norwich]] which terminates at the island. Straight over the island is the continuing A148.\nThe next stretch of road sees the first [[speed camera]] at {{convert|24.5|mi}} from the King's Lynn start point. According to the Norfolk Safety Camera Partnership, the siting of this camera has resulted in only 1% of drivers breaking the speed limit along this section of the road, although before and after accident figures are not available.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.norfolk-safety-camera.org.uk/index.php?page=fixedinfo |title=Norfolk Safety Camera Partnership |access-date=20 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201000516/http://norfolk-safety-camera.org.uk/index.php?page=fixedinfo |archive-date=1 February 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Junction right to [[Kettlestone]] just past this site has always been a notorious accident Black Spot, as has the staggered cross road Junction at [[Little Snoring]] just beyond. At {{convert|25.5|mi}} the road passes through part of Little Snoring and through a cross road junction with Snoring Road. On the right just past the junction is [[Green Man|the Green Man]] [[Public House]]. For the next {{convert|2|mi}} the road dips and rise through scenic woodland on either side of the road crossing the [[River Stiffkey]] at Brookhill plantation. On the right at Thursford is another filling station and a restaurant called the Old Forge. Dating from the 14th century the old forge was once a coaching station and many years ago was a resting place for [[pilgrim]]s making their way to [[Our Lady of Walsingham|Walsingham Abbey]]. Today it is a popular [[seafood]] restaurant. Now at {{convert|27.6|mi}} since the start, the road emerges from the woodland and reaches a junction where the B1354 sweeps away to the right towards [[Melton Constable]]. The A148 swings northeast up an incline over a crossroads and past the [[Crawfish]] public house on the left which serves Thai food. The route now inclines and straightens out passing through more [[woodland]] before entering an area of open countryside. This long straight takes you to another filling station on the left. [[Bale, Norfolk|Bale]] Filling station marks {{convert|29.3|mi|km}} from the start.\n[[File:Safety Cameras at Bale Norfolk 22nd Oct 2007 (1).JPG|thumb|180px|Speed camera site at Bale]]\n500m from the garage is the second and last speed camera<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://norfolk-safety-camera.org.uk/index.php?page=pdf-viewer&pdf=Fixed%20Site%20-%20A148%20Bale%20-%20F9.pdf |title=Norfolk Safety Camera Partnership - PDF Viewer<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=21 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025133041/http://norfolk-safety-camera.org.uk/index.php?page=pdf-viewer&pdf=Fixed%20Site%20-%20A148%20Bale%20-%20F9.pdf |archive-date=25 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> on the A148. Once again the placing of this camera has been a deterrent to speeding with only 2% of drivers passing this point breaking the [[speed limit]], although again it is not clear whether this has resulted in a reduction of accidents. From the camera's location the road takes a long sweeping bend toward the north east and once again the road is characterised by long straight section across open countryside. At {{convert|31.3|mi|km}} the road to the left at the crossroads is the [[B1156 road|B1156]] to the village of [[Langham, Norfolk|Langham]], the right hand lane leads to the village of [[Sharrington]]. {{convert|1|mi|km|sing=on}} further on from the crossroads the road narrows in width and enters a section that is undulating and includes some very sharp blind bends. Drivers should be mindful of the fact that this road is used considerably by HGVs and this section should be driven with great care. At {{convert|33.3|mi|km}} the road passes through the village of [[Letheringsett]]. On the right in the centre of the village is the Kings Head Public House which is a fine example of a Georgian Building. Also on this junction is one of two Watermills in the village. The road crosses the [[River Glaven]] next to this redundant mill and 100 m further on passes a Brown Tourist sign locating the second Watermill on the right. Letheringsett Watermill<ref>[http://www.letheringsettwatermill.co.uk/ Letheringsett Watermill, Holt, Norwich, Norfolk, milling demonstrations, wholewheat flour, spelt flour<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> is the last remaining watermill in Norfolk to produce flour. From Letheringsett the road inclines towards the Town of [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]] reaching the western end of the town center at {{convert|34.4|mi|km}}. In the past the A148 passed through the center of this Georgian town but today it by-passes the center. At the next roundabout the road turns left on to the bypass. The road to the right is the B1110 to [[Melton Constable]], the road straight over the island is the [[B1149 road|B1149]] to [[Norwich]]. The by-pass was built on the old track bed of the [[Midland & Great Northern Joint Railway]]. At {{convert|35.8|mi|km}} the road from the left marks the point were the by-pass rejoins the old route of the A148. Just before this junction is Holt Station on the preserved part of the afore mentioned railway. It is the [[North Norfolk Railway]] which runs from [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]] via [[Weybourne, Norfolk|Weybourne]] to [[Sheringham]]. The road now passes through [[High Kelling]] and out into the open countryside. Glimpse of the sea can now be seen on the left as the road heads towards the village of [[Bodham]] at {{convert|37.7|mi|km}}.\n\n{{convert|1|mi}} further on is the junction with the B1157 on the left which takes travellers to the village of [[Upper Sheringham]]. Also at this junction there is a brown Tourist Sign indicating the entrance, 10 m from the junction, to Sheringham Park which is a [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] property. The roads route now takes the high ground parallel with the coast.

It rises  nearly a vertical mile only {{convert|3|mile}} from the coast as the crow flies.  This is one of the steepest gradients from ocean to summit in the contiguous United States,  It is a popular [[hiking]] destination.  The average gradient from sea level to summit is around 33%, which is steeper than the average gradient from Owens Valley to the summit of Mount Whitney. Near the mountain summit, the oak woodland and chaparral transitions to a pine forest and the rare [[Santa Lucia Fir]]s.<ref name=\"cascade\"/>\n\nThe peak is accessible by driving the [[Nacimiento-Fergusson Road]] and then turning north {{convert|6|mi}} on Forest Route 22S05. {{asof|01|2020}}, the Forest Service route was closed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cone Peak Summit Trail |url=https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/cone-peak-summit-trail |website=AllTrails.com |accessdate=20 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> The the very rough Coast Ridge Road rises to {{convert|3,800|ft}}. From that point the summit is {{convert|2.25|mile}} hike along the Cone Peak Trail (4E12). There are two trails from the coast to the summit of Cone Peak: via the Stone Ridge/Gamboa Trail or the Vicente Flat Trail.<ref name=\"cascade\">{{cite web |title=Cone Peak \"Sea to Sky\" \u2013 Vicente Flat |url=https://cascadeclimbers.com/forum/topic/71401-tr-cone-peak-quotsea-to-skyquot-vicente-flat/ |website=CascadeClimbers.com |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hext |first1=Rebecca |title=Conquering Cone Peak, Big Sur |url=https://www.bayarea.com/play/hike/conquering-cone-peak-big-sur/ |website=BayArea |accessdate=20 April 2020 |date=12 November 2016}}</ref> There is a disused [[lookout tower]] on the summit.\n\nThe peak is topped by a forest [[fire lookout]] built in 1923. The original 13 X 13 wooden-sided ground-level cab house was built on a rock foundation. It originally had a hipped \"dunce cap\" roof, and was called a \"California Lookout\" design. The building was hauled in pieces by mules up the steep and narrow {{convert|2|mile}} trail. During World War II, it served the [[Aircraft Warning Service]]. In 1959. the U.S. Forest Service replaced the hipped roof with a flat roof that could be used to land a [[Bell 47J Ranger|Bell-47]] helicopter. The wood siding was replaced with metal which protected the structure from fire and vandalism. The lookout was last staffed in 1990.<ref name=\"lookout\"/> {{asof|2018}}, the building houses [[radio repeater]] equipment and cannot be easily reactivated for use as a fire tower once again.<ref name=\"lookout\">{{cite web |title=Cone Peak Lookout {{!}} National Historic Lookout Register |url=http://nhlr.org/lookouts/us/ca/cone-peak-lookout/ |website=nhlr.org |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe lookout atop Cone Peak was one of six active fire lookouts in the Monterey Ranger District of the Los Padres National Forest.
