Many members of the community believe there were several flaws in the investigation, that there may have been a cover-up and conspiracy to protect Cst Koester.

[[Houston, British Columbia]], is a small community of approximately 3,000 in Northern B.C.  Koester with other police officers, was assigned to patrol around the arena looking for drinkers who then returned inside, intoxicated. Koester approached Bush in the parking lot consuming a bottle of beer with a group of friends. Koester emptied the bottle and gave a warning to Bush. Koester then continued his patrol and upon returning to the area were Bush was, he noticed Bush with another open bottle of beer and decided to give Bush a ticket for having open liquor in public. \n\nWhen asked for his name, Bush gave a false name.  Koester cautioned him about lying about his name and that he could be charged with obstruction but Bush lied again to avoid being fined and Koester arrested him. As another officer approached he identified who Bush actually was.\n\n==Arrest and death==\nKoester searched Bush after the arrest but did not find his identification in his wallet, nor a bottle of beer Bush had hidden on him. Koester took Bush to the police station to issue him a Promise to Appear and release him from custody.  There were no other police officers in the police station at the time.  Koester and Bush were inside an interviewing room equipped with CCTV recording cameras, however Koester chose not to turn the cameras on, which was a normal thing not to do at the detachment. (The CPC recommended that the RCMP install automated CCTV recording equipment in every RCMP detachment in areas where prisoners are dealt with and released.) Houston has now done so. \n\nInside the police station, Koester claims he and Bush got into a scuffle. Koester said that Bush was angry about being charged and said words to the effect of \"Why don't I just punch you in the fucking face!\"  Koester claimed that a fight started and he could not radio for help. Koester reports that Bush was winning the fight and began strangling him from behind. Koester drew his gun, reached behind his head, struck Bush with the gun three times in the back of the head, and then shot Bush once in the back of the head. Bush died instantly. Photographs of Koester after the incident show extensive bruising and cuts to his left eye and forehead. The bullet was lodged above his eyebrows.\n\n==Controversy==\nConstable Koester's actions surrounding the Bush death have been cleared through a police Criminal Code investigation, an inquiry by the Commission for Complaints Against the RCMP, and a B.C.

In an interview with the Women Archivists Roundtable of the SAA, Roe elaborates on the relevance of archives:<blockquote>Here are some examples of how we can explain why archives are essential evidence, why they are valuable to our society, and why they deserve support and wide use: Nine miners harbored in a closed shaft after an explosion, and are alive today because the rescuers used archival maps to find that closed shaft; a teacher uses a manumission record as the tangible evidence to help students explore the ideas of slavery and freedom; biologists use historic maps to identify potential sites for reforestation of the American chestnut; a 70 year old woman uses court records to locate her siblings who were adopted out to different families after the death of their parents.

In one of her published journal articles, ''Archival Gothic to MARC Modern: Building Common Data Structures'', she details her passion for archive method:<blockquote>The author analyzes widely used manuals of archival description, discussing the elements of information recommended for inclusion in various kinds of finding aids and the implicit \"data structures\" intended to contain those elements. She also reviews recent developments, mostly related to automation efforts, that have led to more explicit definitions or data structures and presents issues that must be addressed in order to\u00a0 define a general archival information system standard.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Roe|first=Kathleen|date=Winter 1990|title=Abstract from From Archival Gothic to MARC Modern: Building Common Data Structures|url=|journal=The American Archivist|volume=53|pages=56\u201366|jstor=40293424|doi=10.17723/aarc.53.1.70v18r435m327210}}</ref></blockquote>In a review of Roe\u2019s ''Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts'', Susan E. Davis of the [[University of Maryland College of Information Studies|College of Information Studies at the University of Maryland]] praises Roe\u2019s contributions to archival studies. \u201cKathleen Roe is the perfect author to take on the challenge of explaining the evolution of arrangement and description theory and practice. She has been a leader in descriptive standards development throughout the series of changes brought about by several generations of technology.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn ''Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts'', Roe describes the archival process step by step guidelines and explains the nature of archives and manuscripts as well as the functional role of arrangement and description. She explains the different stages of archival work, with acquisition and accessioning to arrangement and processing and finally the developing of accessing tools. Roe defines the principles of archiving and emphasizes the importance of context and description. Roe also describes the development of archival work and descriptive practice in Europe and North America.\n\nShe remains a passionate advocate for archives and their importance to everyone. In an interview with the Women Archivists Roundtable of the SAA, Roe elaborates on the relevance of archives:<blockquote>Here are some examples of how we can explain why archives are essential evidence, why they are valuable to our society, and why they deserve support and wide use: Nine miners harbored in a closed shaft after an explosion, and are alive today because the rescuers used archival maps to find that closed shaft; a teacher uses a manumission record as the tangible evidence to help students explore the ideas of slavery and freedom; biologists use historic maps to identify potential sites for reforestation of the American chestnut; a 70 year old woman uses court records to locate her siblings who were adopted out to different families after the death of their parents. That\u2019s why archives matter.<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Roe, Kathleen D.}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Female archivists]]\n[[Category:Fellows of the Society of American Archivists]]\n[[Category:Wayne State University alumni]]\n[[Category:Michigan State University alumni]]\n[[Category:1950 births]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "italics", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_D._Roe"}
