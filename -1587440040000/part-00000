One night, Barney appears in full scuba suit while drinking scotch. [[Lily Aldrin|Lily]] pulls aside Claire, a woman at the bar, warning her of Barney's villainy, and she sits down with the rest of the gang as they explain the events that lead up to that night.\n\nBarney and [[Robin Scherbatsky|Robin]] were coping with the end of their relationship in their own different ways. Robin said she wanted to throw herself into her career, but [[Marshall Eriksen|Marshall]] and Ted are convinced she will find the love of her life, citing several friends who gave up on dating to focus on their work, only to be married months later. Barney, on the other hand, decides to re-enter the dating scene with a vengeance, using his sacred \"Playbook\". The book describes a set of con artist scenarios designed by Barney to manipulate girls into bed.\n\nMeanwhile, Lily tries to set up Ted with Shelly, a fellow teacher.  When she had originally tried to get them to meet, Lily found Ted and Marshall in the middle of a chicken-finger mouth-stuffing attempt, so she convinced her coworker that Ted wasn't there.  However, Ted is stood up by Shelly; when Lily confronts her, she discovers that Shelly was seduced by an exotic man at MacLaren's. Lily realizes it was Barney and angrily confronts him.\n\nBarney describes the play he used, the \"Lorenzo von [[Matterhorn]]\", using fake websites,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lorenzovonmatterhorn.com/|title=Lorenzopedia, the free encyclopedia|website=Lorenzovonmatterhorn.com |accessdate=August 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremitiesquarterly.com/|title=Phallumegaly - Lorenzo von Matterhorn|publisher=Extremities Quarterly|accessdate=August 13, 2017}}</ref> a [[smartphone]], and an exotic name. Barney's next move is a play called the \"he's not coming,\" where he seduces vulnerable girls at the top of the [[Empire State Building]]. One of the girls Barney picks up, however, is an actress friend of Lily's, and she steals the playbook when in Barney's apartment. Lily reveals the ploy to Barney and threatens to post the playbook on the Internet if he doesn't stop using it. Barney shows up at the apartment in a [[wetsuit|scuba suit]], saying he has one last play, \"The Scuba Diver.\" Lily tells Marshall to post the playbook, but Marshall is bamboozled as there is not a play called \"The Scuba Diver\" in the playbook. They go down to the bar, where Barney sits in a booth. The gang heads over, and Barney tells them he plans to seduce the blonde by the bar. They ask him what \"The Scuba Diver\" is, and Barney breaks down, saying his breakup with Robin was hurting him more than he thought, and this was how he coped. Touched, the gang convinces Claire (the girl at the bar, portrayed by [[Sarah Wright]]) to go out with Barney for a cup of coffee. After they leave, the gang gets a text message from Barney and finds the description of the \"Scuba Diver\" under their table at MacLaren's. It was actually an elaborate [[Confidence trick|con]]; involving Lily's disgust at the playbook, revealing Barney's tricks to Claire, Barney's fake breakdown over his breakup, and his friends encouraging the prey to go with Barney.\n\nFinally, a new co-host, Don, arrives at Robin's pre-morning show, and Robin suddenly realizes that Ted and Marshall may have been right.\n\n===Music===\nNon-original music used in this episode includes [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|''Rondo Alla Turca'']] and a piano version of [[Nino Rota]]'s \"[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film soundtrack)|A Time for Us]]\" from [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s 1968 film ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1541289/soundtrack ''How I Met Your Mother'' \u2013 \"The Playbook\": Soundtrack] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\nDonna Bowman of ''[[The A.V.

One night, Barney appears in full scuba suit while drinking scotch. [[Lily Aldrin|Lily]] pulls aside Claire, a woman at the bar, warning her of Barney's villainy, and she sits down with the rest of the gang as they explain the events that lead up to that night.\n\nBarney and [[Robin Scherbatsky|Robin]] were coping with the end of their relationship in their own different ways. Robin said she wanted to throw herself into her career, but [[Marshall Eriksen|Marshall]] and Ted are convinced she will find the love of her life, citing several friends who gave up on dating to focus on their work, only to be married months later. Barney, on the other hand, decides to re-enter the dating scene with a vengeance, using his sacred \"Playbook\". The book describes a set of con artist scenarios designed by Barney to manipulate girls into bed.\n\nMeanwhile, Lily tries to set up Ted with Shelly, a fellow teacher.  When she had originally tried to get them to meet, Lily found Ted and Marshall in the middle of a chicken-finger mouth-stuffing attempt, so she convinced her coworker that Ted wasn't there.  However, Ted is stood up by Shelly; when Lily confronts her, she discovers that Shelly was seduced by an exotic man at MacLaren's. Lily realizes it was Barney and angrily confronts him.\n\nBarney describes the play he used, the \"Lorenzo von [[Matterhorn]]\", using fake websites,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lorenzovonmatterhorn.com/|title=Lorenzopedia, the free encyclopedia|website=Lorenzovonmatterhorn.com |accessdate=August 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.extremitiesquarterly.com/|title=Phallumegaly - Lorenzo von Matterhorn|publisher=Extremities Quarterly|accessdate=August 13, 2017}}</ref> a [[smartphone]], and an exotic name. Barney's next move is a play called the \"he's not coming,\" where he seduces vulnerable girls at the top of the [[Empire State Building]]. One of the girls Barney picks up, however, is an actress friend of Lily's, and she steals the playbook when in Barney's apartment. Lily reveals the ploy to Barney and threatens to post the playbook on the Internet if he doesn't stop using it. Barney shows up at the apartment in a [[wetsuit|scuba suit]], saying he has one last play, \"The Scuba Diver.\" Lily tells Marshall to post the playbook, but Marshall is bamboozled as there is not a play called \"The Scuba Diver\" in the playbook. They go down to the bar, where Barney sits in a booth. The gang heads over, and Barney tells them he plans to seduce the blonde by the bar. They ask him what \"The Scuba Diver\" is, and Barney breaks down, saying his breakup with Robin was hurting him more than he thought, and this was how he coped. Touched, the gang convinces Claire (the girl at the bar, portrayed by [[Sarah Wright]]) to go out with Barney for a cup of coffee. After they leave, the gang gets a text message from Barney and finds the description of the \"Scuba Diver\" under their table at MacLaren's. It was actually an elaborate [[Confidence trick|con]]; involving Lily's disgust at the playbook, revealing Barney's tricks to Claire, Barney's fake breakdown over his breakup, and his friends encouraging the prey to go with Barney.\n\nFinally, a new co-host, Don, arrives at Robin's pre-morning show, and Robin suddenly realizes that Ted and Marshall may have been right.\n\n===Music===\nNon-original music used in this episode includes [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|''Rondo Alla Turca'']] and a piano version of [[Nino Rota]]'s \"[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film soundtrack)|A Time for Us]]\" from [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s 1968 film ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1541289/soundtrack ''How I Met Your Mother'' \u2013 \"The Playbook\": Soundtrack] at the Internet Movie Database.</ref>\n\n==Critical response==\nDonna Bowman of ''[[The A.V.

The song was originally performed in the film by [[Jeremy Irons]], with [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Cheech Marin]], and [[Jim Cummings]] providing supporting vocals; Cummings performed partial material for [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] after Irons' voice gave out.\n\nThe song is also featured in the 1997 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Lion King]]'', with [[John Vickery (actor)|John Vickery]], [[Kevin Cahoon]], [[Stanley Wayne Mathis]], and [[Tracy Nicole Chapman]] performing it in the original Broadway cast for the musical. [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] performed an altered version of the song in the 2019 [[The Lion King (2019 film)|film adaptation]].\n\n==''The Lion King''==\nThe song is performed as a musical number by [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], who lusts for the position as king of the Pride Lands. Scar is inspired to develop a plot for both his brother Mufasa and his nephew Simba to be murdered, and tells about this plan through song to a large army of [[spotted hyena]] minions by his pledge to spare the hungry animals from starvation if they provide him with assistance.\n\n====Production====\nOriginally, the song (first called \"Thanks to Me\") was about Scar introducing the hyenas to the lionesses after he pronounced himself king. This idea was eventually scrapped and replaced with ''Be Prepared''.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} A reprise of the song after Mufasa's death was also cut from the film, but is featured in the [[The Lion King (musical)|musical version]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn the beginning of the second verse, an army of hyenas is shown [[Goose step|goose-stepping]] in front of Scar, who is perched on an overlooking cliff in resemblance of [[Adolf Hitler]] with upwards of 22 beams of light pointing straight-up (resembling the [[Cathedral of light]] featured in many of the [[Nuremberg Rallies]]). Shadows cast onto the cliff evoke for a brief second monumental columns. This is modeled after footage from the [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] propaganda movie ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-lion-king-be-prepared-nazi-film-2014-6|title=The Darkest Song From 'The Lion King' Was Based On A 1935 Nazi Propaganda Film|last=Pallotta|first=Frank|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref>\n\nThough [[Jeremy Irons]] is credited for performing the lead vocals on the song, at the 2012 [[Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo]], [[Jim Cummings]], who also played Ed, stated that he sang most of the song, and that Irons only did some of the talking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Cummings on Hakuna Matata and Be Prepared|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrdn9eFTK8&t=3m15s|date=3 May 2012}}</ref> However, footage from the film's recording sessions available on the film's 2017 Blu-ray release reveals that Irons sang the entire first verse of the song, while a cursory analysis of the recording suggests (due to a subtle but evident shift in vocal timbre heard in Scar's lead vocal) that Cummings only sang the final verse (\"So be prepared for the coup of the century...\") in the final cut of the film. Cummings has also confirmed this in other interviews, claiming that he sang this last verse due to Irons developing vocal problems during the recording session.<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/lion-king-voice-actors_b_968140.html</ref>\n\n====Original recording====\nOn the original soundtrack recording, Scar opens the song with a [[soliloquy]]:\n\n{{cquote|I never thought hyenas essential. They're crude and unspeakably plain. But maybe they've a glimmer of potential if allied to my vision and brain.}}\n\nIn the film, this is cut and the song begins immediately. This was due to a plot adjustment.<ref>[http://www.lionking.org/scripts/Script.html#prepared TLK Script (HTML 3.0 Version)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The soliloquy had Scar considering using the hyenas for his plot, but in the final version of the story he had already used the hyenas in his plans before the song. The soliloquy is, however, included in the Broadway version.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===International versions===\nWhen the movie was first released in 1994, it numbered complexively 28 versions worldwide, including a special [[Zulu language|Zulu]] version made in [[South Africa]].

film as it was considered too dark.]]\n\nDuring early production of the film, there was a reprise created of the song, taking place after Scar has assumed power over the Pride Lands. He is given the idea by Zazu to find a mate. So he tries seducing [[Nala (The Lion King)|Nala]], who refuses his advances, and is therefore banished by Scar. He then unleashes the hyenas upon the Pride Lands as his \"executive staff\". The reprise was ultimately removed from the film and the concept was later recycled in \"[[The Madness of King Scar]]\" was included in the Broadway musical version of the film.<ref>{{cite video|title=Scar Wants Nala as His Queen|author=Allers, Roger|authorlink=Roger Allers|location=The Lion King: Diamond Edition |type = Blu-ray |year=2011 |publisher=Walt Disney Home Entertainment}}</ref>\n\n==''The Lion King 1\u00bd''==\nIn [[DisneyToon Studios|DisneyToon]]'s 2004 direct-to-video film ''[[The Lion King 1\u00bd]]'', the music from the beginning of the song is briefly heard as [[Timon and Pumbaa]] tour Scar's lair as a possible new home, commenting on how it is quiet, secluded and with no uninvited visitors. The shadows of the goose-stepping hyena army are then seen marching in front of them, though they haven't started singing yet. Timon and Pumbaa stare at them for a few seconds, and remark that the hyenas \"ain't the traveling company of [[Riverdance]].\" They then riverdance out of the scene.\n\n==''The Lion King'' (2019)==\nOn February 3, 2019, Skyler Shuler of The DisInsider reported that \"Be Prepared\" would be one of the songs featured in the [[The Lion King (2019 film)|2019 remake of ''The Lion King'']], directed by [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Be-Prepared-Will-Be-Featured-in-THE-LION-KING-Live-Action-Film-20190203|title='Be Prepared' Will Be Featured in THE LION KING Live Action Film|first=Stephanie|last=Wild|work=BroadwayWorld|date=February 3, 2019|accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/29/the-lion-king-scar/|title=The Lion King\u2019s Chiwetel Ejiofor on the diabolical psychology of Scar|first=Marc|last=Snetiker|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 29, 2019|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref> On June 24, 2019, the remake was confirmed to feature a reworked version of the song.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-lion-king-soundtrack-details-new-song|title=\u2018The Lion King\u2019 Soundtrack Details Revealed; Includes New Elton John Song|first=Adam|last=Chitwood|work=[[Collider]]|date=June 24, 2019|accessdate=June 24, 2019}}</ref> The song is heavily altered and shortened from the original film, partially to reflect Scar's different dynamic with the hyenas. In the film, the song depicts Scar's first meeting with the hyenas as opposed to the original in which they have known each other for some time; he does not insult them and appeals to their impoverished lifestyle in order to convince them to join his coup.\n\n==''The Lion King'' Broadway musical==\nAs in the original soundtrack recording, Scar begins the song with a brief soliloquy. The song is similar to its film counterpart in most respects, including the goose stepping hyenas, but there is a dance number performed by the hyena ensemble halfway through.  Scar later sings a brief [[reprise]] while declaring himself king at Mufasa's funeral in which he introduces the hyenas as his direct and privileged minions (the aforementioned deleted reprise from the film).  However, the Broadway reprise was not featured in the soundtrack, and is instead replaced with a sinister chord at the end of the song \"Rafiki Mourns\". In other soundtracks from different productions, the song is not represented at all.\n\n==''Festival of The Lion King''==\nIn [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]]'s ''[[Festival of the Lion King]]'', Kiume sings the song while the theater takes on a darker tone with the male dancers carrying spears and shields, while the female dancers dance with streamers. After Kiume sings the first verse, the solo hyena performer does a tribal dance with a fire torch. In the finale, when the snippet of \"Be Prepared\" is sung, the hyena comes back out but dances with blades.\n==Reception==\n===Original Version===\nThe song has garnered positive reaction and review. Becky Fuller from [[Screen Rant]] gave the song's original version a positive review.

The song was originally performed in the film by [[Jeremy Irons]], with [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Cheech Marin]], and [[Jim Cummings]] providing supporting vocals; Cummings performed partial material for [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]] after Irons' voice gave out.\n\nThe song is also featured in the 1997 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[The Lion King]]'', with [[John Vickery (actor)|John Vickery]], [[Kevin Cahoon]], [[Stanley Wayne Mathis]], and [[Tracy Nicole Chapman]] performing it in the original Broadway cast for the musical. [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] performed an altered version of the song in the 2019 [[The Lion King (2019 film)|film adaptation]].\n\n==''The Lion King''==\nThe song is performed as a musical number by [[Scar (The Lion King)|Scar]], who lusts for the position as king of the Pride Lands. Scar is inspired to develop a plot for both his brother Mufasa and his nephew Simba to be murdered, and tells about this plan through song to a large army of [[spotted hyena]] minions by his pledge to spare the hungry animals from starvation if they provide him with assistance.\n\n====Production====\nOriginally, the song (first called \"Thanks to Me\") was about Scar introducing the hyenas to the lionesses after he pronounced himself king. This idea was eventually scrapped and replaced with ''Be Prepared''.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} A reprise of the song after Mufasa's death was also cut from the film, but is featured in the [[The Lion King (musical)|musical version]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn the beginning of the second verse, an army of hyenas is shown [[Goose step|goose-stepping]] in front of Scar, who is perched on an overlooking cliff in resemblance of [[Adolf Hitler]] with upwards of 22 beams of light pointing straight-up (resembling the [[Cathedral of light]] featured in many of the [[Nuremberg Rallies]]). Shadows cast onto the cliff evoke for a brief second monumental columns. This is modeled after footage from the [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] propaganda movie ''[[Triumph of the Will]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/the-lion-king-be-prepared-nazi-film-2014-6|title=The Darkest Song From 'The Lion King' Was Based On A 1935 Nazi Propaganda Film|last=Pallotta|first=Frank|website=Business Insider|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref>\n\nThough [[Jeremy Irons]] is credited for performing the lead vocals on the song, at the 2012 [[Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo]], [[Jim Cummings]], who also played Ed, stated that he sang most of the song, and that Irons only did some of the talking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jim Cummings on Hakuna Matata and Be Prepared|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wmrdn9eFTK8&t=3m15s|date=3 May 2012}}</ref> However, footage from the film's recording sessions available on the film's 2017 Blu-ray release reveals that Irons sang the entire first verse of the song, while a cursory analysis of the recording suggests (due to a subtle but evident shift in vocal timbre heard in Scar's lead vocal) that Cummings only sang the final verse (\"So be prepared for the coup of the century...\") in the final cut of the film. Cummings has also confirmed this in other interviews, claiming that he sang this last verse due to Irons developing vocal problems during the recording session.<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jim-hill/lion-king-voice-actors_b_968140.html</ref>\n\n====Original recording====\nOn the original soundtrack recording, Scar opens the song with a [[soliloquy]]:\n\n{{cquote|I never thought hyenas essential. They're crude and unspeakably plain. But maybe they've a glimmer of potential if allied to my vision and brain.}}\n\nIn the film, this is cut and the song begins immediately. This was due to a plot adjustment.<ref>[http://www.lionking.org/scripts/Script.html#prepared TLK Script (HTML 3.0 Version)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The soliloquy had Scar considering using the hyenas for his plot, but in the final version of the story he had already used the hyenas in his plans before the song. The soliloquy is, however, included in the Broadway version.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n===International versions===\nWhen the movie was first released in 1994, it numbered complexively 28 versions worldwide, including a special [[Zulu language|Zulu]] version made in [[South Africa]]. This is not just the only Zulu dubbing ever made by Disney, but also the only dubbing made in any [[Languages of Africa|African language]], other than [[Arabic]].<ref>{{Cite

He then unleashes the hyenas upon the Pride Lands as his \"executive staff\".

Timon and Pumbaa stare at them for a few seconds, and remark that the hyenas \"ain't the traveling company of [[Riverdance]].\" They then riverdance out of the scene.\n\n==''The Lion King'' (2019)==\nOn February 3, 2019, Skyler Shuler of The DisInsider reported that \"Be Prepared\" would be one of the songs featured in the [[The Lion King (2019 film)|2019 remake of ''The Lion King'']], directed by [[Jon Favreau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Be-Prepared-Will-Be-Featured-in-THE-LION-KING-Live-Action-Film-20190203|title='Be Prepared' Will Be Featured in THE LION KING Live Action Film|first=Stephanie|last=Wild|work=BroadwayWorld|date=February 3, 2019|accessdate=February 3, 2019}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/movies/2019/04/29/the-lion-king-scar/|title=The Lion King\u2019s Chiwetel Ejiofor on the diabolical psychology of Scar|first=Marc|last=Snetiker|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=April 29, 2019|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref> On June 24, 2019, the remake was confirmed to feature a reworked version of the song.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\">{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/the-lion-king-soundtrack-details-new-song|title=\u2018The Lion King\u2019 Soundtrack Details Revealed; Includes New Elton John Song|first=Adam|last=Chitwood|work=[[Collider]]|date=June 24, 2019|accessdate=June 24, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==''The Lion King'' Broadway musical==\nAs in the original soundtrack recording, Scar begins the song with a brief soliloquy. The song is similar to its film counterpart in most respects, including the goose stepping hyenas, but there is a dance number performed by the hyena ensemble halfway through.  Scar later sings a brief [[reprise]] while declaring himself king at Mufasa's funeral in which he introduces the hyenas as his direct and privileged minions (the aforementioned deleted reprise from the film).  However, the Broadway reprise was not featured in the soundtrack, and is instead replaced with a sinister chord at the end of the song \"Rafiki Mourns\". In other soundtracks from different productions, the song is not represented at all.\n\n==''Festival of The Lion King''==\nIn [[Walt Disney World]]'s [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]]'s ''[[Festival of the Lion King]]'', Kiume sings the song while the theater takes on a darker tone with the male dancers carrying spears and shields, while the female dancers dance with streamers. After Kiume sings the first verse, the solo hyena performer does a tribal dance with a fire torch. In the finale, when the snippet of \"Be Prepared\" is sung, the hyena comes back out but dances with blades.\n==Reception==\n===Original Version===\nThe song has garnered positive reaction and review. Becky Fuller from [[Screen Rant]] gave the song's original version a positive review. He describes the song as \"camp, fun, and just scary enough to make younger viewers feel a little on edge\" and perfectly summed up Scar's character. He praised Jeremy Irons' performance, citing his deep, dulcet tones is perfect for the song. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/lion-king-2019-be-prepared-villain-song-bad/|title=The Lion King 2019 Gets All the Songs Right (Except Be Prepared)|first=Becky|last=Fuller|work=[[Screen Rant]]|date=July 21, 2019|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n[[Glen Weldon]] from [[NPR]] also praised the song as indelible and iconic for its pure expression of Scar's character.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2019/07/17/742204352/lion-king-2019-be-prepared-villain-anthem-jeremy-irons-chiwetel-ejiofor|title=The Lion King Had the Perfect Villain Song, This Time Be Prepared for Less|first=Glen|last=Weldon|work=[[NPR]]|date=July 17, 2019|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref> Hannah-Rose Yee from Stylist cited Be Prepared as one of the best songs in the film for mixing humor and tragedy in the lyrics that builds up the character's deluded aspiration and twisted desire.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/lion-king-live-action-be-prepared-cut-elton-john-beyonce/271463|title=Lion King fans, beware: the live action movie has cut the film's best song|first=Hannah-Rose|last=Yee|work=Stylist|date=June 14, 2018|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===2019 Remake===\nThe remake song received a mixed to negative reaction.

It can also be used to lock and unlock password-protected [[Notes (Apple)|notes]] on iPhone and iPad.  \n\nIt has been part of all [[iPhone]]s since 2013's [[iPhone 5S]] up until 2020\u2019s [[iPhone SE (2020)|iPhone SE (2nd generation)]]. Touch ID has been used on all [[iPad|iPads]] since 2014's [[iPad Air 2]], with the exception of the third and subsequent generations of the [[iPad Pro]], where it has been discontinued in favor of Face ID. In 2015, Apple introduced a faster second-generation Touch ID in the [[iPhone 6S]]; a year later in 2016, it made its laptop debut in the [[MacBook Pro]] integrated on the right side of the [[Touch Bar]]. In MacBooks, each user account can have up to three fingerprints, and a total of five fingerprints across the system<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://support.apple.com/en-ae/HT204587 |title = About Touch ID advanced security technology}}</ref>.\nIn 2017, Apple released the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus with Touch ID, alongside the [[iPhone X]] that instead incorporated [[Face ID]].\n\nIn 2020, Apple announced the return of the classic Touch ID sensor, this time on the iPhone SE (2nd generation), which has a similar design to the iPhone 8. This is the first iPhone to feature Touch ID since the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, both released in 2017.\n\nFingerprint information is stored locally in a [[IOS#Secure_Enclave|secure enclave]] on the [[Apple A7]] and later chips, not in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], a design choice intended to make it impossible for users to externally access the fingerprint information.\n\n==History==\n[[File:iPhone 5S home button.png|thumb|right|The [[iPhone 5S]] ''(pictured)'' was the first model with a Touch ID sensor integrated with its home button.]]\nIn 2012, Apple acquired [[AuthenTec]], a company focused on fingerprint reading and identification management software, for $356 million.<ref name=\"CNET announcement\">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57602245-37/fingerprint-sensor-touch-id-unlocks-new-iphones|title=iPhone 5S comes with Touch ID fingerprint scanner|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|date=September 10, 2013|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> The acquisition led commentators to expect a fingerprint reading feature.<ref name=\"CNET announcement\" /><ref name=\"TC announcement\">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/10/apples-touch-id-a-500ppi-fingerprint-sensor-built-into-iphone-5s-home-button|title=Apple's Touch ID Is A 500ppi Fingerprint Sensor Built Into The iPhone 5S Home Button|last=Valazco|first=Chris|date=September 11, 2013|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> Following leaks and speculation in early September,<ref name=\"NWE touch id leak\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nowhereelse.fr/bouton-home-iphone-5s-lecteur-empreintes-digitales-87919|title=iPhone 5S : Une photo du bouton Home avec lecteur d'empreintes digitales ?!|date=September 3, 2013|publisher=NowhereElse|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"NWE leak\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nowhereelse.fr/iphone-5s-lecteur-empreintes-digitales-confirme-88283|title=iPhone 5S : Le lecteur d'empreintes digitales confirm\u00e9 ?!|date=September 10, 2013|publisher=NowhereElse|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> the iPhone 5S was unveiled on September 10, 2013, and was the first phone on a major US carrier to feature the technology.<ref name=\"The Verge announcement\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4715372/confirmed-apple-iphone-5s-will-include-touch-id-fingerprint-scanner|title=Apple's new iPhone will read your fingerprint|publisher=[[The Verge]]|first=Casey|last=Newton|date=September 10, 2013|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> Apple's [[Vice president|Vice President]] of Marketing, [[Phil Schiller]], announced the feature at Apple's iPhone media event and spent several minutes (the major portion of the conference) discussing the feature.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Maynard Um predicted on September 4, 2013, that a fingerprint sensor in the [[iPhone 5S]] would help [[mobile commerce]] and boost adoption in the corporate environment.<ref name=\"Apple Insider predicted\">{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/09/04/fingerprint-sensor-in-apples-iphone-5s-predicted-to-boost-mobile-commerce-enterprise-adoption|title=Fingerprint sensor in Apple's 'iPhone 5S' predicted to boost mobile commerce, enterprise adoption|publisher=[[AppleInsider]]|first=Neil|last=Hughes|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> \"As consumers increasingly rely on mobile devices to transact and store personal data, a reliable device-side authentication solution may become a necessity,\" Um said.<ref name=\"Apple Insider predicted\"/>\n\nWith the unveiling of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus at a keynote event on September 9, 2014, Touch ID was expanded from being used to unlock the device and authenticating App Store purchases to also authenticating Apple Pay. The [[iPhone 6s|iPhone 6S]] incorporates a second-generation Touch ID sensor that is up to twice as fast as the first-generation sensor found in the 5S, 6, and SE (1st generation) phones. As of April 2020, the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus, SE (2nd generation) (2020), 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro, iPad Pro 10.5 and 12.9 (second generation), and 2018 [[MacBook Air]] are the Apple devices which use the second generation sensor. The new Touch ID unlocks almost instantly and posed an issue as it unlocks too fast to read notifications on the lock screen. This is remedied with the [[iOS 10]] update in which a user must press the home button to have the home screen appear, however this can be changed in the iOS settings to where users can just rest their finger on the sensor to unlock the user's device and go directly to the home screen, similar to previous versions of iOS. Solely placing a finger on the sensor will only unlock the iPhone unless said setting is enabled, and no notifications are currently being displayed on the lock screen.\n\n==Generations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

It can also be used to lock and unlock password-protected [[Notes (Apple)|notes]] on iPhone and iPad.  \n\nIt has been part of all [[iPhone]]s since 2013's [[iPhone 5S]] up until 2020\u2019s [[iPhone SE (2020)|iPhone SE (2nd generation)]]. Touch ID has been used on all [[iPad|iPads]] since 2014's [[iPad Air 2]], with the exception of the third and subsequent generations of the [[iPad Pro]], where it has been discontinued in favor of Face ID. In 2015, Apple introduced a faster second-generation Touch ID in the [[iPhone 6S]]; a year later in 2016, it made its laptop debut in the [[MacBook Pro]] integrated on the right side of the [[Touch Bar]]. In MacBooks, each user account can have up to three fingerprints, and a total of five fingerprints across the system<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://support.apple.com/en-ae/HT204587 |title = About Touch ID advanced security technology}}</ref>.\nIn 2017, Apple released the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus with Touch ID, alongside the [[iPhone X]] that instead incorporated [[Face ID]].\n\nIn 2020, Apple announced the return of the classic Touch ID sensor, this time on the iPhone SE (2nd generation), which has a similar design to the iPhone 8. This is the first iPhone to feature Touch ID since the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, both released in 2017.\n\nFingerprint information is stored locally in a [[IOS#Secure_Enclave|secure enclave]] on the [[Apple A7]] and later chips, not in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]], a design choice intended to make it impossible for users to externally access the fingerprint information.\n\n==History==\n[[File:iPhone 5S home button.png|thumb|right|The [[iPhone 5S]] ''(pictured)'' was the first model with a Touch ID sensor integrated with its home button.]]\nIn 2012, Apple acquired [[AuthenTec]], a company focused on fingerprint reading and identification management software, for $356 million.<ref name=\"CNET announcement\">{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57602245-37/fingerprint-sensor-touch-id-unlocks-new-iphones|title=iPhone 5S comes with Touch ID fingerprint scanner|last=Rosenblatt|first=Seth|date=September 10, 2013|publisher=[[CNET]]|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> The acquisition led commentators to expect a fingerprint reading feature.<ref name=\"CNET announcement\" /><ref name=\"TC announcement\">{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/09/10/apples-touch-id-a-500ppi-fingerprint-sensor-built-into-iphone-5s-home-button|title=Apple's Touch ID Is A 500ppi Fingerprint Sensor Built Into The iPhone 5S Home Button|last=Valazco|first=Chris|date=September 11, 2013|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> Following leaks and speculation in early September,<ref name=\"NWE touch id leak\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nowhereelse.fr/bouton-home-iphone-5s-lecteur-empreintes-digitales-87919|title=iPhone 5S : Une photo du bouton Home avec lecteur d'empreintes digitales ?!|date=September 3, 2013|publisher=NowhereElse|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"NWE leak\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nowhereelse.fr/iphone-5s-lecteur-empreintes-digitales-confirme-88283|title=iPhone 5S : Le lecteur d'empreintes digitales confirm\u00e9 ?!|date=September 10, 2013|publisher=NowhereElse|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> the iPhone 5S was unveiled on September 10, 2013, and was the first phone on a major US carrier to feature the technology.<ref name=\"The Verge announcement\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/10/4715372/confirmed-apple-iphone-5s-will-include-touch-id-fingerprint-scanner|title=Apple's new iPhone will read your fingerprint|publisher=[[The Verge]]|first=Casey|last=Newton|date=September 10, 2013|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> Apple's [[Vice president|Vice President]] of Marketing, [[Phil Schiller]], announced the feature at Apple's iPhone media event and spent several minutes (the major portion of the conference) discussing the feature.\n\nWells Fargo analyst Maynard Um predicted on September 4, 2013, that a fingerprint sensor in the [[iPhone 5S]] would help [[mobile commerce]] and boost adoption in the corporate environment.<ref name=\"Apple Insider predicted\">{{cite web|url=http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/09/04/fingerprint-sensor-in-apples-iphone-5s-predicted-to-boost-mobile-commerce-enterprise-adoption|title=Fingerprint sensor in Apple's 'iPhone 5S' predicted to boost mobile commerce, enterprise adoption|publisher=[[AppleInsider]]|first=Neil|last=Hughes|date=September 4, 2013|accessdate=September 11, 2013}}</ref> \"As consumers increasingly rely on mobile devices to transact and store personal data, a reliable device-side authentication solution may become a necessity,\" Um said.<ref name=\"Apple Insider predicted\"/>\n\nWith the unveiling of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus at a keynote event on September 9, 2014, Touch ID was expanded from being used to unlock the device and authenticating App Store purchases to also authenticating Apple Pay. The [[iPhone 6s|iPhone 6S]] incorporates a second-generation Touch ID sensor that is up to twice as fast as the first-generation sensor found in the 5S, 6, and SE (1st generation) phones. As of April 2020, the iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, 7, 7 Plus, 8, 8 Plus, SE (2nd generation) (2020), 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro, iPad Pro 10.5 and 12.9 (second generation), and 2018 [[MacBook Air]] are the Apple devices which use the second generation sensor. The new Touch ID unlocks almost instantly and posed an issue as it unlocks too fast to read notifications on the lock screen. This is remedied with the [[iOS 10]] update in which a user must press the home button to have the home screen appear, however this can be changed in the iOS settings to where users can just rest their finger on the sensor to unlock the user's device and go directly to the home screen, similar to previous versions of iOS. Solely placing a finger on the sensor will only unlock the iPhone unless said setting is enabled, and no notifications are currently being displayed on the lock screen.\n\n==Generations==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
